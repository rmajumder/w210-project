[
  "<p>It's a warm late June evening in Lisbon. A place in the semi-finals is at stake. We're in the last minute of normal time. England have been leading since the third minute of the game and would you believe it, Portugal have just equalised. But wait ... Well inside the Portuguese half, Andrade pulls down the scurrying Hargreaves and it's a free kick. Beckham lines it up as hysterical England fans scream their lungs out. Over comes the inswinger, up goes Campbell. His header hits the bar but bounces down, and Sol buries the rebound. Amazingly, incredibly, unbelievably, we're through! </p> <p>Except, of course, we're not. </p> <p>The Swiss ref's blown. He has seen something, a foul by Terry on the Portuguese keeper just before Campbell's nod. The goal is disallowed. It's extra time. Then penalties. And then, of course, we're out - savagely short-changed, dixit John Motson, by \"the grocer from Zurich\". </p> <p>There can be no serious England fan who does not know EXACTLY who Urs Meier is. There can be few people in England who do not at least recognise the name. This summer, he was the nation's No 1 hate figure, a \"half-wit Swiss banker\" (the Sun), an \"Emmenthal-eating appeasement monkey\" (London Evening Standard), an \"Urs Hole\" (Daily Star). </p> <p>It wasn't just the papers. Asda offered all Swiss nationals a free check-up in its 68 optical centres, its financial services director explaining helpfully that it was \"obvious to everyone that Sol scored, except to the Swiss referee, who needs his eyes testing\". The airline Flybe, in an email ad titled \"We was robbed\", said it was stopping flights to Switzerland \"as a mark of respect to our lads, and some of the worst refereeing in years\". </p> <p>More than three months after that fateful night in the Estadio da Luz, Urs Meier is still angry. Not with the English as such, because he knows England, he likes it, he knows we are not all imbeciles. He is angry because he feels few people deserve the treatment he got, and because though he loves and admires English football, he will never referee here again. Most of all, he is angry with the British tabloids, but we'll come back to that. </p> <p>First, though, that foul. \"It was the right decision, absolutely, I have no doubts whatsoever,\" says Meier firmly, sitting in his office in a small village, complete with onion-dome church, outside Zurich. (For the record, Mr Motson, he runs a successful business selling domestic appliances - washing machines, fridges, microwaves, vacuum cleaners and the like - mainly to property developers, who like to sell their newly built flats with fully equipped kitchens.) \"If I was in the same position again, I would make the same call. Terry interfered with the goalkeeper. It was a foul. The whole world can see it.\" </p> <p>Campbell complained immediately, Meier recalls, \"but I told him it wasn't his fault, it was his team-mate's. I had blown the whistle fast, maybe even before Campbell's header. Everyone seemed to accept it. I felt no resentment from the players in half an hour of extra time, and afterwards, in town, I had dinner and I saw lots of England and Portugal supporters. No one said a word about it. So the next morning it was, well, quite a big shock.\" </p> <p>Meier is bronzed and energetic, with sharp eyes and a genuine if highly polished smile. He evidently cares what he looks like, dressing snappily and sporting artful blond highlights in both his hair and that goatee. He has been a ref for nearly 30 years, since 1977, and has spent the past 10 years on the Fifa international list, officiating in seven Champions' League semi-finals and one final, at two Euros and two World Cups. </p> <p>As a kid, he says, he had always wanted to be a player. But he realised he wasn't good enough, and switched paths. \"It's good for a referee to have played a bit,\" he says. \"It helps to know what a player is feeling, how he'll react.\" </p> <p>Meier has been the target of fans' fury before. The first time was in August 1997, after a Croatia Zagreb-Newcastle Champions' League qualifier. Meier gave a penalty and sent a Croatian player off just before half time, and Newcastle went on to win. \"I was on the front pages for four days, until Princess Diana died,\" he says in his precise English. </p> <p>\"The TV angle didn't show what I saw; it sometimes doesn't. But the fuss was unfair: five years later I refereed that same side again, and the player I had sent off was now the captain. He asked me if I remembered him, and I said yes. I asked him if my decision had been right, and he said yes. The thing is, the public doesn't know that; no one ever comes out and says, hang on, the ref was right.\" </p> <p>Then came a Euro qualifier between Denmark and Romania last year. Meier awarded a penalty against Romania in the first half and later allowed four-and-a-half minutes of injury time in which Denmark scored the equaliser in a 2-2 draw that knocked the Romanians out. The Bucharest dailies published his email address and he was bombarded with 14,000 hate-filled messages. </p> <p>It was a small foretaste of what was to happen this summer. </p> <p>England-Portugal was \"fantastic, one of the most beautiful games I've ever refereed,\" Meier says. \"The atmosphere, the play, first one side in the lead then the other, it had everything.\" The first hint of trouble came the next morning, when he tried to access his email. </p> <p>\"The inbox took forever to open,\" he recalls, \"and when it did, it said I had 16,000 unread mails. Then, when I walked through the lobby, seven men jumped up and started taking photos. One held up his hand and said: This is a red card, from the Sun. Then I knew it was a campaign.\" </p> <p>Later, Meier's company staff in Switzerland called to say they had taken some 5,000 abusive phone calls since it opened at 8am: the Sun had printed not just the referee's email address, but his phone number. Meier was getting multiple death threats. </p> <p>The referee stayed in Portugal until the following Tuesday. In the meantime, British journalists had planted a huge flag of St George outside his house; doorstepped as many people in his village as would speak to them; dubbed him a \"love rat\" who had cruelly dumped his ex-wife Franziska; invented a so-called quote in which Meier admitted there never had been a foul; fabricated a lot of tosh about his supposed property portfolio; and offered his 14-year-old son cash and tickets to an Arsenal-Man U game if he would only dish some dirt on his dad. </p> <p>When he arrived home, Meier was met by police at the airport and hustled off the plane and down a back staircase into an unmarked car. From there he was driven to Baden, where his girlfriend Nicole Petignat (the first woman to referee a men's international match) was waiting. The couple fled to a hideaway in French-speaking Switzerland. \"The police said they had to take the threats seriously,\" Meier says. \"It just takes one lunatic, they said.\" </p> <p>For three days, Meier says, \"I felt like a hunted animal. And for three or four weeks I coudn't sleep, I had terrible dreams. And I felt so bad about the effect of this whole thing on my family. They had nothing to do with this!\" </p> <p>Meier still feels bad, for several reasons. First, the video evidence shows he was absolutely right: \"All the neutral commentators agree, even people who have had a decision of mine go against them, like Franz Beckenbauer. He said on German television that he had no reason to like me, but it was definitely a foul.\" </p> <p>He feels bad that Uefa didn't knock the whole campaign on its head by publishing a statement supporting him on the day after the match (they did, but several days too late). \"They underestimated the whole thing,\" he says. \"We've talked about it. Dealing with this kind of campaign against high-profile referees is now a priority. It's not right that matches get stopped and teams get fined when one firecracker gets thrown onto the pitch, but something like this happens and nothing at all is done.\" </p> <p>He feels bad that no one in England - not the FA, not the England manager, not the team captain or even the players - has publicly acknowledged that his decision was at the very least justifiable, or come forward to denounce a campaign of vicious vilification. \"There has to be an official reaction to this kind of thing in the future,\" he says. \"Someone has to say it's not possible.\" </p> <p>But mainly he feels bad about the newspapers: \"Without the tabloids, this would not have happened. It's just not the right way to react to a refereeing decision, even if it had been a wrong one. It isn't journalism, giving people's private addresses, making things up. What do I think of the Sun?\" He pauses, and answers with a wholly Swiss precision: \"I don't think it is necessary to buy this newspaper.\" </p> <p>There are three football photographs on the wall behind the desk of Meier's office, and they are all of the glory days of English football: Dave MacKay and Billy Bremner squaring off in the 1970s; Busby Babes Bill Foulkes and Duncan Edwards playing against Arsenal in 1958; Roger Hunt in spectacular action against West Ham in 1964. </p> <p>\"I had always thought that fair play was the thing in England; in all my games, all my career, I've always thought that,\" he says. Once, in a 1999 Champions' League match, he gave a penalty against Arsenal that, when he saw the TV replays afterwards, he saw had been a mistake: Barcelona's Philippe Cocu had dived. \"Martin Keown told me I was wrong, and afterwards I had to agree with him,\" Meier says. \"It happens. You can't see everything. But even though Arsenal went on to lose that game, partly because of a bad call by me, the players made no complaint. In the pub afterwards, the fans were fine.\" </p> <p>Now, although he promises that he can \"make the distinction: I know it's a wonderful country with fantastic people; I know not everyone thinks like this, I know not everyone has been blinded,\" he is not sure how he will be greeted when he next travels to these shores. </p> <p>He won't be refereeing here again: at 45, he must retire by the end of the year and it has been tacitly decided that, all things considered, it would not be a good idea for him to officiate at a Champions' League game in England this season. He is sad about that, and also about the fact that he will probably not be bringing his children to London for a holiday, as he did last year. </p> <p>Can he understand, begin to understand, why it happened? \"I can see that England, the English newspapers, need a scapegoat when the side loses,\" he says. \"It can be Beckham missing a penalty or getting sent off, it can be another player, it can be the manager. People didn't WANT to see the truth. Always, they need a scapegoat. This time, it was me. If that's how it is, fine. But the papers at least should take responsibility for what they say and do. I think only in England, only the English papers, would do this. It's, well ... it's a shame.\"</p>",
  "<p>If someone has to drain the poison from the chalice and give it a good rinse, then it might as well be Michael Owen. That choirboy innocence may be a useful protective covering for a player who has always known how to take care of himself but it will do him no harm tonight when England meet Azerbaijan and he takes over the captaincy from a man who finds himself caught up in yet another controversy. </p> <p>\"I know how the system works and whatever I say is going to be the wrong thing, so you'll have to forgive me for dodging it,\" Owen said last night, responding to an invitation to comment on David Beckham's admission that he contrived a booking on Saturday in order to get himself suspended and thus expunge a previous yellow card from his record. </p> <p>Nevertheless there were a couple of leading questions about the right and wrong ways for a player, particularly an international captain, to conduct himself on the pitch, and one of them concerned Owen's gift for winning penalties, notably against Argentina in the World Cup matches of 1998 and 2002. </p> <p>\"Football's a competitive game,\" Owen replied, \"but I'd never fall over and try to win a penalty without being touched. Diving is a form of cheating and I'd never do it. But there's a skill in drawing defenders into fouling you. If I entice an opponent into conceding a penalty, in my view that's a tick in my box. If he touches you, it's a penalty. If he doesn't, you're through. I can't think there's anything wrong with that.\" </p> <p>He acquitted himself well when given the armband for England's warm-up games before the 2002 World Cup finals, while Beckham recovered from his broken metatarsal, and his last experience of the job came 16 months ago, in England's 2-1 victory over Slovakia in a Euro 2004 qualifying match at the Riverside Stadium. That result was particularly encouraging, since England had fallen behind during a wretched first half and needed to show their character after the interval. As if to prove that the responsibility would not impair his personal performance, Owen scored both of his team's goals. </p> <p>\"You look around and you think, well someone's got to take the game by the scruff of the neck,\" he said. \"Thankfully I had the opportunity. And as soon as I scored one, I knew we were going to score more. Maybe being the captain gave me the extra percentage to push myself even harder.\" </p> <p>Not that he gave any sign of coveting the job on a permanent basis. \"Obviously it's David's normal role,\" he said. \"I only act as a deputy on the odd occasion. But I think I'm quite similar to David in that I don't rant and rave in the dressing room or on the pitch. I like to talk but I'm not a big shouter. I've been on the international scene quite a long time, I've got a lot of experience and I try to concentrate on my own game and lead by example more than anything.\" </p> <p>Many people commented on the liveliness of his performance in Saturday's victory over Wales, particularly at a time when he is struggling to make an impact at Real Madrid. If he did not score, it was not for want of trying to claim England's opening goal, a fourth-minute shot by Frank Lampard which took a deflection off the heel of Owen, who was looking in the opposite direction at the time. Lampard eventually got the decision but not before Alan Shearer had remarked that even such an outrageous piece of luck could restore an anxious striker's confidence. </p> <p>\"Obviously we both wanted to claim it,\" Owen said. \"Frank may be a midfielder but he's a goalscoring midfielder and it's always a feather in your cap to score at international level. We had a chat and a laugh in the hotel afterwards and decided to leave it to the relevant parties. We remain the best of mates.\" </p> <p>It was only when he watched the replay after the game that he saw the way the ball had changed direction and decided to stake his claim. But the moment that really helped his confidence had come even earlier. </p> <p>\"You're always anxious in a game to do the first thing right to set you up for the rest of the match and one of my first touches was in quite a nice position, just where I like it, where I was running at a defender. So right from the first minute I was in the groove.\" </p> <p>He and Jermain Defoe had been asked by Sven-Goran Eriksson to play ahead of Wayne Rooney, a tactical switch that seemed to work, although some were struck by the poignancy of Owen, so recently a teenage goalscoring phenomenon himself, being asked to adapt his game to the 18-year-old's advantage. </p> <p>\"It was our duty to create space for Wayne,\" he said. \"But when he gets that space, in turn things open up for everyone. I know Wayne enjoyed it, from talking to him afterwards. Even though he had responsibilities, he felt free. </p> <p>\"I'm not sure about that being his position for ever because I'm not sure that Manchester United and England will always play that formation. If we were going into a big tournament, I'm not sure we'd play three forwards in every game. But in essence that's his position. He's not one to be chasing balls hit over the top. He likes to touch the ball and to play people in, and shooting from long range is another strength of his. So playing behind a main striker is definitely his position.\" </p> <p>Nor was there a hint of jealousy from the veteran of 24 years and 64 caps. \"I'm pleased Wayne doesn't play the same way as me,\" Owen said, \"otherwise we'd be going for the same balls all the time. But I think the balance is there. We dovetail quite well. And I'm excited to have another great footballer to play with.\"</p>",
  "<p>Berti Vogts will retire to the stand at the Republican Stadium this evening to watch as his future as Scotland's team manager is determined. If this is to be his last hurrah, the fact that he will be able to exert minimal influence on proceedings might be seen as strangely appropriate. </p> <p>A touchline ban will restrict Vogts's impact, though he has often cut a marginalised figure since taking over more than two years ago. His English remains erratic, and results have stuttered, the tactics employed too often baffling exponents rather than opponents. It has left the Scottish Football Association's first foreign manager on the brink. </p> <p>There is widespread sympathy for Der Terrier given the lack of international-class players available to him, though that has been overtaken by frustration at a perceived lack of progress. A patched-up and makeshift team will trot out against Moldova tonight attempting to squeeze a first win, and a first goal, from this campaign. \"I expect to win this game,\" said Vogts. </p> <p>Scotland should have enough to succeed tonight, but with their next qualifier not until the trip to Italy in March, that would leave the SFA - recently criticised for its unwillingness to address the manager's position - with a tricky decision. Anything but a win and the 11-man board would be compelled to act. </p> <p>There was a desperation about Vogts yesterday. \"Maybe it was my fault [against Norway on Saturday] and there are no excuses,\" said the German, who will check Russell Anderson's ankle today before deciding on his defence. \"But we are a small nation and I've worked here very hard, the hardest I have as a coach, towards my vision. </p> <p>\"When I took over the national team was on its last legs. Maybe I'll go after the World Cup in 2006 and the future of Scottish football will be bright. This qualifying campaign is not over after two matches. If we lose and we win the next seven games, we will qualify. But this is a must-win match.\" </p> <p>Vogts has taken to tub-thumping, his rhetoric littered with demands for \"passion\", \"commitment\" and \"more than 100% effort\". If the SFA thought it was recruiting a distinguished coach, it must presumably be privately disappointed with a back-to-basics approach. </p> <p>Saturday's defeat by Norway was the last straw for many, prompting Craig Burley to denounce the team as a \"laughing stock\" on national radio. </p> <p>\"That sums the guy up,\" snarled the captain Barry Ferguson, who will undergo a test on a hamstring. \"The boys will react to those comments. Berti's limited to what he can pick, and Burley's missing the point.\" </p> <p>But too many points have been lost recently - five in two games - and the Scots will be aware that Italy laboured to edge past Moldova here on a bumpy pitch last month. \"They scored one and then started wondering when their flight home was,\" Vogts said. \"We have to play simple football, with balls over the top and a direct style, with pace.\" </p> <p>Vogts and Scotland know anything less is unthinkable. </p> <p> <strong> Moldova</strong> (probable, 4-3-1-2): Hmaruc; Lascencov, Catansus, Brigennic, Savinov; Olexici, Ivanov, Bursuc; Covalciuc; Miterev, Rogaciov. </p> <p><strong> Scotland</strong> (probable, 4-1-3-2): Gordon (Hearts); G Caldwell (Hibernian), Webster (Hearts), S Caldwell (Sunderland), Naysmith (Everton); Holt (Norwich); Fletcher (Manchester United), Ferguson (Blackburn), Pearson (Celtic); Thompson (Rangers), Crawford (Plymouth). </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> K Jacobsson (Iceland). </p> <p><strong> TV: BBC1 Scotland 7pm</strong><br></p>",
  "<p>Discount retailer Matalan said yesterday that it had received a takeover approach for its loss-making Lee Cooper jeans brand. </p> <p>The identity of the possible bidder has not been disclosed and Matalan said talks were at a \"very early stage\", but it has granted them a period of exclusivity to negotiate a deal. </p> <p>Analysts said the Lee Cooper business, which is nearly 100 years old, is likely to be worth \u00a320m to \u00a330m. It is understood that Matalan wants to retain the UK rights to the label. </p> <p>Matalan, which has recently regained its position as the UK's top denim retailer, bought Lee Cooper, one of Europe's biggest branded jeans manufacturers, three years ago, paying private equity group Bridgepoint Capital \u00a345m. </p> <p>At the time it was producing annual profits of \u00a3400,000 but Lee Cooper has struggled almost ever since. It was said to have lost out when customers balked at doing business with a rival retailer and more recently Matalan said Lee Cooper had hit big problems in France. It recorded first-half losses of \u00a3800,000. </p> <p>Lee Cooper's history dates back to 1908 when the Morris Cooper workwear factory was founded. It manufactured British Army uniforms during the second world war and was renamed Lee Cooper, in hon our of the founder's daughter-in-law, when it emerged as a fashion company after the war. </p> <p>Matalan also owns Falmers, which has become its own label, and the Wolsey socks and pants label. Shares in the retailer climbed 1.5p to 234p. </p> <p>Matalan, whose shares were changing hands at 150p in March, has regularly been at the centre of bid speculation in recent months, with US discounter Wal-Mart tipped as the most likely bidder as its Asda offshoot targets non-food ranges to drive its growth. </p> <p>The Skelmersdale-based chain's founder, John Hargreaves, is viewed as a willing seller but is said to want 300p a share for the 52% of the business controlled by his family. </p> <p>Asda is now opening stand-alone George fashion outlets on UK high streets and last week opened its first Asda Living store in Walsall, which stocks clothing, homewares, electronics and entertainment goods. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Levi Strauss yesterday reported a quarterly profit, compared with a loss this time last year. The company said it was helped by sales of higher-priced products in Europe and Asia and lower costs, as well as the weaker dollar, which boosted overseas revenues. </p> <p>San-Francisco based Levi is trying to turn around its business after seven years of sliding sales. It turned in a profit of $46.6m in the third quarter compared with a loss of $4.3m a year earlier. </p> <p>Sales fell 8.2% to $995m. The decline was expected, partly because sales last year were lifted by initial shipments to Wal-Mart for the launch of the Levi Signature brand. </p> <p>Levi has seen its credit rating tumble due to a heavy debt load and tough competition from more youth-oriented brands. The company, which has cut jobs and closed factories to try to remain competitive, recently announced it was considering selling its Dockers brand. </p> <p>Levi Strauss is privately held but reports financial results because of its outstanding bonds. </p> <p>The company said during the quarter it cut its outstanding debt, less cash, to $2bn from $2.1bn a year earlier.</p>",
  "The French cosmetics company L'Or\u00e9al profited from a house which had been confiscated from its Jewish owners when they were sent to their death in concentration camps during the second world war, it was claimed in the appeal court in Paris yesterday. <p>Edith Rosenfelder, the sole survivor, now 76, has embarked on a long legal battle for compensation from the company, which had its German headquarters on the site of her childhood home for more than 30 years. </p> <p>The case is complicated by years of confusion, worsened by the frequent sale and resale of the property, but the family claims that L'Or\u00e9al is guilty of receiving stolen goods. </p> <p>\"L'Or\u00e9al know that the property was confiscated, and they know that the owners are still alive, Mrs Rosenfelder's daughter Monica Waitzfelder said. </p> <p>\"All the other businesses which took Jewish property have since returned it, without any great debate. I don't understand why L'Or\u00e9al should be any different from the others.\" </p> <p>The battle has been waged by three generations of the Rosenfelder family. In 1937, as the Nazi persecution of Jews increased, the family abandoned its three-storey house in the German industrial city of Karlsruhe and fled to France. </p> <p>Fritz Rosenfelder was forced to sell the house to a Nazi offi cial who ran an insurance company, BGV. </p> <p>Ms Waitzfelder says that the proceeds of the sale, which amounted to only 12% of the 1936 value of the house, were never paid to her family. </p> <p>The family was later deported. Edith Rosenfelder escaped but her mother died in Auschwitz in 1942 and her father died in a Red Cross camp in Switzerland in 1945. </p> <p>The Jewish restitution legislation signed by the allies at the end of the war stated that even transactions which appeared to have been made with the owners' consent could be declared invalid. </p> <p>The Rosenfelders' case centres on the argument that since the original sale was illegal, all subsequent sales were equally unlawful. </p> <p>They stress that although a restitution payment was made in 1951 to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organisation, it was done without the family's knowledge and none of the 5,000 German marks paid by the insurance company BGV ever reached the family. </p> <p>In 1954 BGV sold the property to an offshoot of L'Or\u00e9al, Haarfarben und Parf\u00fcmerien GmbH - later L'Or\u00e9al Allemagne - which introduced the brand to the German market. </p> <p>L'Or\u00e9al says it bought out the offshoot in 1961, and cannot be held responsible for transactions before then. The property was sold for DM5.3m in 1991. Yesterday the court began considering whether L'Or\u00e9al can be sued for compensation.</p>",
  "<p>The Oxford Lieder festival, a fortnight of concerts and talks, is now three years old. Schubert and Schumann dominated the first two festivals, and so, this year, the feature has switched to the songs of the third member of the fellowship of the 19th-century Lied, Brahms. The programmes are presented by a carefully balanced mixture of young, upwardly mobile artists and experienced recitalists and accompanists. There are appearances by Lisa Milne, James Gilchrist, Ian Partridge and Geraldine McGreevy, with pianists including Malcolm Martineau and Graham Johnson, as well as the pairing that brought Schubert's Die Winterreise to the second night of the festival, Mark Padmore and Julius Drake. </p> <p>The very first performance of Winterreise, at the house in which Schubert was lodging in March 1825, was a private concert with the composer playing the piano, and the Holywell Music Room, in which Padmore and Drake gave their compelling account, is probably not that much larger. It felt like an intimate gathering; there was an arresting vividness in the way each song was projected, with both singer and pianist keenly aware that the smallest inflection would register with everyone in the audience. </p> <p>Padmore is a wonderfully accomplished artist, even and pure of tone, always intensely musical and consistently imaginative in the way he colours each phrase. But he and Drake always took the long view, carefully mapping the emotional trajectory of the cycle as a whole and clearly identifying its emotional turning points - placing the first great crisis in the anguished sections of the seventh number, Auf Dem Flusse, for instance - without ever forgetting that these are art songs, and not operatic arias. Drake constantly filled out the psychological background - his punctuations to Fr\u00fchlingstraum were positively explosive - so that there was a perfect balance between what the singer and the accompanist were doing, and the listener was naturally guided between the two, as all great lieder performances should do. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>The Oxford Lieder festival runs until October 23.

  "<b> Financial Times </b> Editorial, October 12 <br> <p> \"Chen Shui-bian, the Taiwanese president, has this week launched a diplomatic offensive to improve the island's uneasy relations with the Chinese mainland. Both Beijing and Washington should take Mr Chen's overtures seriously and seize the chance to ease tension in the Taiwan Strait. </p> <p>\"Mr Chen is regarded with deep suspicion by the Chinese Communist party leaders, who believe he is trying to inch Taiwan towards formal independence... On Sunday he suggested he would be willing to resume cross-strait talks... [and on Monday] the Taiwanese government... called for direct passenger and cargo flights between the two countries... Mr Chen needs to rein in his advisers, ministers and supporters and stop them making provocative comments... China ought to welcome his remarks and negotiate cross-strait transport links.\" </p> <p><b> Taiwan News </b> Editorial, October 11 <br> </p> <p> \"We approve of these proposals, which signal the... government's commitment to fostering genuine peace... and which hint at a greater degree of confidence and autonomy in our external policy... But we also would like to remind Mr Chen that no Taiwanese government should offer concessions that violate the right of our 23 million people to self-determination or that impede our advancement along 'our own Taiwan road' of 'democracy, freedom, human rights and peace'.\" </p> <p><b> South China Morning Post </b> Editorial, October 11 <br> </p> <p> \"If Mr Chen is sincere, it could be just the linguistic gymnastics that will get talks with the mainland back on track. Negotiations have stalled since 1999, when his predecessor, Lee Teng-hui, characterised relations between the two sides as 'state to state', and it looks unlikely that they will start again unless some definition of 'one China' can be agreed on... </p> <p>\"Despite the possibility that Mr Chen's speech was pure politicking, the latest overtures should not be rejected out of hand... How the ideas are received in Beijing, though, will be determined in large part by the level of faith the mainland leaders have in Mr Chen and his proof of sincerity... It is not clear that the mainland will be sympathetic... At the very least, the proposal for talks on direct air links should be taken up immediately.\" </p> <p><b> Straits Times </b> Editorial, Singapore, October 12 <br> </p> <p> \"Beijing's official silence so far speaks volumes. Analysts in Beijing are unanimous that Mr Chen is playing word games... Beijing's one non-negotiable condition is that Taiwan must acknowledge the 'one-China' principle. Mr Chen did not so much as mention 'one China' in his speech... </p> <p>\"The Taiwanese people have of late been rattled by Beijing's angry denunciations of Taipei's ever-bolder independence stance, and the shrinking international support for Taiwan... If [Mr Chen] could mollify his public by offering cooperation with China, he would still come out of it smelling like roses if he was snubbed.\" </p> <p><b> Taipei Times </b> Editorial, Taiwan, October 12 <br> </p> <p> \"Taiwan wants peace across the Taiwan Strait, but peace... can only result from a complex negotiating process.

  "<p><strong> BT Group</strong> provided one of the few talking points in a desperately dull London market yesterday and that was only because it was the only blue chip stock to register a fall of more than 2%. </p> <p>The decline came after investment bank CSFB trimmed its earnings forecasts and investors switched into Deutsche Telekom after the German government announced plans to sell up \u20ac4.5bn (\u00a33bn) worth of DT stock. </p> <p>Citing concerns about increased competition in broadband internet access and a slowdown in the lucrative corporate work, CSFB trimmed its earnings forecasts for 2005 and 2006 by 2% and 3% respectively. </p> <p>The bank noted that four of the UK's biggest internet service providers are planning to participate in the unbundling of the local loop and pointed out that newsflow from the corporate sector has not been good. </p> <p>\"While we believe BT continues to take market share, newsflow from other operators points to a slowdown in the corporate services market in recent months and we believe public sector contracts may be slowing as well,\" CSFB warned. </p> <p>With the Bank reiterating its hold rating on the shares, BT closed 4p lower at 181.75p, the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. </p> <p>In the wider market it was one of the quietest sessions in weeks with just over 2.1bn shares changing hands. Traders blamed the torpor on the Columbus Day holiday in the US. The <strong> FTSE 100</strong> traded in a narrow 23 point range before coming to rest 13.4 points lower at 4,685.5, with the telecoms sector doing most of the damage. That said, a profits warning from <strong> J Sainsbury</strong>, off 2p to 250p, did not help sentiment. </p> <p><strong> FTSE 250</strong> eased 7.5 points to 6,372, while the <strong> FTSE Small Cap</strong> index ended 0.6 points lower at 2,605.9. In the bond market, the 10-year gilt closed around 101.560, yielding 4.8%. </p> <p><strong> Gallaher</strong>, the cigarette group, was the day's other stand-out feature as the Japan Tobacco takeover story was dusted down and given a fresh airing. The thinking behind this rumour is that JT, which makes Camel and Mild Seven cigarettes, has a strong presence everywhere in European apart from the UK. </p> <p>Gallaher rose 10p to 663p. </p> <p><strong> Reuters</strong>, the news and financial information group, eased 6.5p to 339.5p unsettled by rumours of big jobs cuts at Deutsche Bank. The Reuters price tends to be sensitive to news of redundancies in the Square Mile given that it supplies most City traders with financial information. </p> <p><strong> Dixons</strong>, down 2.75p to 170.75p, was under pressure after Korean electronics company LG warned of flagging demand for expensive flat-screen televisions. </p> <p>On a brighter note, pest control group <strong> Rentokil Initial</strong> improved 1.75p to 154.75p, lifted by rumours that it might be about to announce the sale of its UK and German linen rental business. Traders said the stock had been supported by talk that Luke Mayhew, the outgoing managing director of John Lewis, has been approached to be its new chief executive. </p> <p>In the FTSE 250 <strong> Serco</strong>, the support services group, was the main talking point due to speculation that it had landed a huge contract. However, sources close to the company played down such talk. Analysts said the speculation could be a case of crossed wires over the \u00a32bn Northern Rail passenger franchise. Although Serco has been named preferred bidder the contract has yet to officially start. Serco rose 4p to 226p. </p> <p>On the downside, chip designer <strong> Cambridge Silicon Radio</strong>, 17.5p lighter at 349.25p, hit a four-week low in the wake of a massive sales warning from peer <strong> Wolfson Microelectronics</strong>, off 62.75p, or 38%, at 101.25p. </p> <p>Among the small caps, <strong> Minorplanet Systems</strong>, supposedly one of Europe's leading providers of fleet tracking systems, was dog of the day. Its shares slumped 4.5p, or 48.5%, to a record low of 4.75p after the company announced that losses for the financial year just ended would be higher than expected and that sales in September had been disappointing. </p> <p>If that were not enough the company also revealed Bank of Scotland had withdrawn a \u00a33m overdraft facility. This has been replaced by a loan facility provided by GE Capital, which just so happens to be one of Minorplanet's biggest shareholders. </p> <p><strong> Countryside Properties</strong>, rose 13p to 274.5p amid talk that chairman Alan Cherry is set to table a 300p-a-share buyout offer. </p> <p>Biotech company <strong> Alizyme</strong>, which had a good run last week after Merrill Lynch started coverage with a buy rating and 190p target price, eased 0.5p to 127p after one of its biggest shareholders, Fidelity, declared the sale of 1.8m shares, or 1.3% of the company. Fidelity's holding in Alizyme now stands at 9.6%. </p> <p><strong> Low &amp; Bonar</strong>, which hit a four-year high last week, fell 2p to 116.5p as JO Hambro Capital Management, the activist investor group, announced the sale of 500,000 shares. </p> <p><strong> API</strong>, the foil and laminates group in which US investment fund Steel Partners has a 10% holding, climbed 6p to 84.5p after it revealed full-year results would top City expectations. House broker Numis Securities responded to that news by lifting its rating on the stock to buy and target price to 100p from 75p. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Finally keep an eye on the <strong> Islamic Bank of Britain</strong>. Shares in the UK's first independent Islamic bank start trading on Aim this morning and are expected to achieve a healthy premium to their placing price of 25p. Traders reckon the \u00a340m share placing was several times oversubscribed. </p> <p><strong>M&amp;S's descent</strong></p> <p>Concern that today's trading update will be even worse than expected saw shares of Marks &amp; Spencer close 1.75p lower at 343p yesterday. </p> <p>Having recently revealed that same-store sales in its clothing and homewares divisions had fallen by 7.7% in the first 10 weeks of the second quarter, expectations for today's statement are not high. </p> <p>Nonetheless, market professionals believe the update will still prove disappointing. Contrary to recent rumours, they believe there was no increase in sales during the final two weeks of the quarter and that M&amp;S experienced one of its worst weeks yet at the end of September. The talk in the Square Mile yesterday was that sales were as much as \u00a318m below budget during that week. </p> <p>M&amp;S shares are unlikely to fall too far today, however, given that the company has promised to buy back \u00a32.3bn worth of shares in a tender offer priced in a range of 332p to 380p. The tender offer, which was used to ward off a bid from entrepreneur Philip Green, is due to close a week on Friday.</p>",
  "Sanctions, it is sometimes said, come somewhere between a soldier and a statement - a thought that may have crossed the minds of EU foreign ministers yesterday when, in short order, they lifted punitive measures on Libya and tightened existing ones on Burma. The timing was coincidental: after 11 years one set of sanctions had run its course, Libya having at last complied with UN demands on the Lockerbie bombing and, as a bonus, surrendered its rickety arsenal of weapons of mass destruction; the batch imposed on Burma is designed to pressure the military regime to ease up on human rights and free Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy activist whose dignified struggle has caught the imagination of the world. Both sets of sanctions highlight the advantages and flaws of this imperfect tool for imposing international standards. Another important aspect was underlined last week when the Iraq Survey Group concluded that UN sanctions against Saddam Hussein had been collapsing before last year's invasion, a reminder that their failure was exploited by US hawks pressing for military action. <p>Recent years have seen a growing recognition that sanctions are a blunt instrument that can easily hurt the wrong people. Success in undermining apartheid in South Africa gave way to disaster in Iraq as the embargo imposed after the invasion of Kuwait impoverished and humiliated a generation of ordinary people while giving a cruel dictatorship a further instrument of control. The Libya sanctions, on the oil industry and air travel, were less draconian but far more effective. They isolated the country, provided a framework around which a settlement could be reached and pressured Colonel Muammar Gadafy into reducing his involvement in terrorism. Crucially, though, the US was able to maintain the support of other countries. </p> <p>Political will of this kind is lacking in Burma. The Asian country should be a soft target since few outsiders have a stake in its economy. Even so, France negotiated loopholes allowing it to continue investing in the oil industry. The latest measures include a visa ban on high-ranking generals and a block on loans to state-owned businesses. Europe has imposed similar \"smart\" sanctions against Robert Mugabe and his senior henchmen in Zimbabwe. But the EU and the US are still at odds over whether to lift the arms embargo imposed on China after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre: when the stakes are very high, only the lowest common denominator can usually be agreed. Still, even unsatisfactory sanctions are preferable to war.</p>",
  "The murder of 14-year-old Danielle Beccan, in a drive-by shooting in Nottingham, prompted a rash of papers to declare the outbreak of a gun crime epidemic. Police believe she was mistakenly shot as she made her way home from a funfair early on Saturday morning. <p>Danielle was \"the latest shocking victim of Britain's rampant gun culture,\" judged the <b> Daily Mail</b>, which said that just five minutes from \"one of the UK's most prosperous and forward-thinking cities\" was \"a lawless 'front line' where gun crime has spread like a cancer\". </p> <p>\"Many who still believe in the Robin Hood-style Nottinghamshire as a gentle rural county have been shocked by a spate of recent high-profile shootings,\" agreed Nick Britten in the <b> Daily Telegraph</b>. \"The killing highlights the difficulty the police face in cracking down on gun crime ... In 2003, there was on average more than one shooting every week in the county.\" </p> <p>The <b> Daily Star</b> warned that innocent people such as Danielle would \"continue to be cut down on our streets until we actually have zero tolerance for drug dealers and armed thugs\". </p> <p>It was true that shooting deaths were becoming more common, said the <b> Independent</b>, and \"firearms offences have risen some 40% in the past six years,\" but the paper added it was \"important to remember that Britain still has one of the lowest levels of gun crime and firearms-related deaths in the world. It is less than most European countries and far below the US.\" Efforts to eradicate gun crime needed to be intensified, but \"we must not lose a sense of proportion.\" </p> <p>In the <b> Times</b>, William Rees-Mogg was dismayed Danielle's death had not had the coverage in the Sunday papers he felt it warranted, despite the fact that \"it was, surely, extremely important, telling us something very alarming about the war on crime in England.\" The killing was a tragedy, said Rees-Mogg, and a \"serious defeat. We are not winning the war against drugs, guns and gangs.\" The home secretary needed to develop a more effective national strategy and more police officers should be enlisted to fight gun crime in the big cities, he said. \"At present the war against guns is being lost, not only in Nottingham.\"</p>",

  "An Afghan man who claims he was tortured by gunmen loyal to a notorious warlord at a strategic checkpoint in Afghanistan showed his scars to a judge and jury at the Old Bailey yesterday. <p>Abdul Ghafour, 32, stood on a platform next to the bench, rolled up his trouser leg and pointed out an old injury allegedly caused by a bayonet being plunged into his knee by militia under the command of Faryadi Zardad during the Afghan civil war. </p> <p>Pushing back his sleeve he also showed a wound he said was caused by the ropes which had bound him as he was beaten with the butt of a kalashnikov, after being pulled from a minibus at a checkpoint on the Jalalabad road to Kabul. </p> <p>Mr Zardad, 42, of Streatham, south London, denies conspiracy to torture and conspiracy to take hostages. </p> <p>A mujahideen commander in the Hizb I Islami party (Islamic Party) led by warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, he controlled three checkpoints at Sarobi, 50 miles outside Kabul, until 1996 when he fled the Taliban. </p> <p>Arrested in Britain, he is being prosecuted in this country under international conventions which allow alleged torturers to be tried in England wherever the offences were committed. </p> <p>Mr Ghafour is one of a handful of witnesses who appeared in court in person. Others will give their testimony via satellite link from the British embassy in Kabul. </p> <p>He told the court there were other commanders at checkpoints in the area between Sarobi and Jalalbad from Hizb I Islami, but none with a reputation as bad as Mr Zardad. </p> <p>Mr Ghafour, who was a member of the rival faction Jamiat I Islam, alleges he was tortured on three occasions as he travelled between Pakistan, where he was a student, and Kabul, where his family lived. </p> <p>The first time he was stopped by militia men carrying kalashnikovs he was beaten and kicked in an underground bunker for 10 minutes. </p> <p>A few months later he was stopped again at a different temporary checkpoint.\" Ordered out of a minibus, he was put inside a metal shipping container. </p> <p>He claimed he was tied up, questioned and beaten with the butt of a kalashnikov. </p> <p>\"One of them stuck me with a spike, like a knife on the end of a gun barrel in my knee,\" he added. </p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",
  "Two warring factions of the Free Church of Scotland are to go to court today in a multi-million pound dispute over property. <p>The Free Church Continuing is suing the Free Church of Scotland at the court of session in Edinburgh in an attempt to take control of assets the breakaway church claims belongs to it. </p> <p>Around 20 \"hardline\" ministers broke away from the Presbyterian and Sabbatarian Free Church in 2000 after they claimed the church failed properly to discipline Professor Donald Macleod, a popular \"liberal\" minister. </p> <p>Prof Macleod, who is now principal of the Free Church college in Edinburgh, was accused in the 1990s of adultery and sexually assaulting women.

  "It was late afternoon as Major Joel Hagy made a delivery to a private health clinic less than five minutes drive from his base on the outskirts of Sadr City, Baghdad's violent eastern Shia slum. <p>Even though the area around the clinic was thought to be quiet, it required three armoured Humvees and a dozen soldiers, three with machine guns, to bring just four cardboard boxes of medicine. </p> <p>A crowd of children gathered and the soldiers gleefully threw into the air packets of chocolates, toys and dolls. </p> <p>To the major and his soldiers from the 1st battalion of the 12th US Cavalry the short visit represents what they regard as a successful reconstruction programme. \"In the areas that we frequent the most with either food or water or medicine there are fewer mortars launched at us,\" said Maj Hagy. \"There is a very palpable change.\" </p> <p>But his brief hospital visit also reveals the yawning gap between what the US and the Iraqi government are providing and the obvious and vast needs of Iraqis in this benighted and violent area, one of the poorest sectors of the capital. </p> <p>Yesterday may mark a turning point. </p> <p>The militia loyal to the young cleric Moqtada al-Sadr which has fought running battles with the US military in Sadr City for months, tentatively began handing in its weapons as part of a new ceasefire deal. </p> <p>In return the Iraqi government has pledged compensation for relatives of the dead and injured and a vast reconstruction programme. If the new ceasefire is to hold, it will rely heavily on the speed and quality of US-led rebuilding projects. </p> <p>Other projects, stalled by the fighting, should restart in Sadr City, including a $20m (\u00a311m) sewage repair programme to deal with the open sewers that run through the streets of the slum, and a new street cleaning operation. </p> <p>Few of the aid agencies left in Iraq have been able to operate here, so it is the US military that takes the lead. </p> <p>\"Did we turn north-east Baghdad into Cleveland in the last 18 months? No,\" said Maj Hagy, speaking days before the latest ceasefire was agreed. </p> <p>\"Did we make improvements? Yes.\" </p> <p>Muhammad Hussein, 29, who runs the clinic, was pleased with the delivery, but also uncomfortable at accepting donations so publicly from the US military. </p> <p>\"We are grateful for what they bring,\" he said. \"But the conditions around us are not so good.\" Most of his patients are children suffering from gastroenteritis, because of the appalling sewage and contaminated water supplies in the area. </p> <p>He is too scared to speak freely about Mr Sadr, the Shia cleric whose Mahdi militia has battled against the far better armed and better trained US cavalry. Some of the troops also find the situation odd. \"One day I am feeding them, at night I am shooting them,\" said one of the soldiers delivering the medicine. </p> <p>When the battalion arrived in March, Sadr City was so peaceful they brought no tanks and were scoffed at by other soldiers on the base for even bringing Bradley armoured vehicles. </p> <p>Most soldiers then patrolled in Humvees with the doors removed. Then in the first week of April, Mr Sadr led a rebellion across southern Iraq and in eastern Baghdad. Negotiations ended the fighting in May, and then the cleric launched another uprising in August and again a ceasefire was negotiated. </p> <p>Gradually attacks on US troops in Sadr City increased once again until the most recent ceasefire deal this weekend. The fighting added to the delays that have held back any serious signs of rebuilding. </p> <p>It had reached the point where the cleric's militia ran its own courts, schools and police force and the regular Iraqi police were either too intimidated to resist or sympathetic to the cleric. </p> <p>The cavalry's camp, Forward Operating Base Eagle, came under mortar attack almost daily, several dozen soldiers were injured or killed and many of the tanks and Bradleys bore the marks of street combat. </p> <p>Several soldiers spoke openly of their frustration and aggression. \"We may ask you to close your eyes sometimes because to save lives we've got to do things we are not proud of,\" said one young soldier. </p> <p>\"We don't really know who we are fighting. We are just trying to do our best,\" said Private First Class Matt Sparks, who joined the army last year and was sent to Iraq straight from basic training. \"There are people who don't want to fight. Some of them are coming forward and telling us things to find those people [the militia]. But a lot are so scared they sit at home and do nothing ... They are not helping us get rid of these people.\" </p> <p>In frank moments, officers admitted they were struggling to win the sympathy of the Iraqis in the area and that reconstruction was seriously hampered. </p> <p>\"Their propaganda machine is obviously a lot better than ours,\" said Captain Arne Gibbs, the battalion intelligence officer. Bureaucracy and \"money issues\" were in part to blame for the slow pace of rebuilding, he said. But attacks on the troops also had a huge impact. \"There are only so many hours in the day,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We either try to secure the area or build a sewage line. It is one or the other.\" Attempts to co-opt more moderate clerics have worked only \"to a limited degree\". </p> <p>In Friday sermons from the local mosques the Iraqi government and the US military come in for stinging criticism. Electricity shortages, poor healthcare and sanitation and limited fresh water are all blamed on the US military. </p> <p>Mr Sadr expertly built a thuggish movement hungry for power on the back of the delays in reconstruction. At the same time the chronic sanitation and infrastructure problems have undermined the power of more moderate figures. </p> <p>Councillors from Sadr City who have chosen, at huge risk, to work with the US are frustrated. \"If the Americans had listened to us right from the beginning this wouldn't have happened,\" said Siham Hattab Hamdan, an English literature professor from Sadr City who sits on the district, city and provincial councils. </p> <p>She hopes the new street cleaning operation, which has employed many young men from Mr Sadr's militia, may mark a small step towards calming the violence. \"We have to do this because we cannot live like this for another year. Things will become worse not better.\"</p>",
  "<b> A union dissolved</b> <br> <p>It will go down in history as the most powerful union ever to emerge out of Britain's working classes. Formed in 1945, the National Union of Mineworkers at the height of its powers had nearly 600,000 members. This wasn't a union you could easily join. If you were a miner, you were inside the bubble; if not, you were outside. Simple as that - in or out. Soon, if a merger with the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union goes ahead, everyone may soon be out. </p> <p>When I first heard the name of the NUM, a 15-year-old only three months out of school, it was linked with the weight of a generation before me. Standing at the gates to Solsgirth colliery in Fife on September 10 1979, I, along with more than a hundred other new teenage miners, received my \"check\" number (the number management would know us by) in my left hand and my \"card\" number in my right (the number union officials would use). (A Glen: check 515, card 7890.) One minute I was an outsider, a 15-year-old boy; the next I was one of the men. </p> <p>It was Tory prime minister Stanley Baldwin who once said: \"Do not rub your nose against the NUM.\" For nearly 40 years many governments tried, but it was only with the strike of 1984-85 that the fate of the NUM would eventually be decided. </p> <p>It was a vicious year that saw communities split apart, but one often overlooked fact of the strike is the unrelenting efforts the NUM made to look after its members, both financially and socially. The Fife branch held weekly meetings in a social club in Dunfermline, where myself and hundreds of others would gather to receive a weekly allowance (\u00a37.50 for single miners; \u00a318 for those with families) and meet others in the same predicament. </p> <p>Although the money was undoubtedly helpful, it was the sense of camaraderie that pervaded these meetings that was priceless. It was here that stories of hardship (lack of money, demoralisation, hunger) and joy (picket line fights, sense of a cause worth fighting for) were traded. </p> <p>Following the strike, Neil Kinnock, then leader of the Labour party, publicly backed the NUM; privately he blamed Scargill for not holding ballots before calling the strike. It was the beginning of the end of a partnership that stretched back to the days of Keir Hardie in 1892. </p> <p>Over its 60-year history, the NUM achieved more than any other union in Britain: it stood up for ordinary workers; believed in the power of solidarity and community; and blackened the eyes of a few Tory prime ministers. And there are plenty worse legacies to have than that.<br><b>Allan Glen</b></p> <p> <b> No sex for streaky Beckham</b><br> </p> <p>Those of you who have seen the seminal romcom Legally Blonde may recall the courtroom scene in which our heroine, Elle Woods, elegantly unravels a witness's alibi by questioning her account that, at the time of her father's murder, she was first having her hair permed, then taking a shower. The problem, as Elle points out, is that one of the first rules of perming is that one should avoid at all costs getting the perm wet in the first few hours. </p> <p>So it was impossible not to feel a twitch of deja vu when reading the account of Harlow beautician Dannielle Heath, who alleged in a Sunday paper that she had rough-and-tumbled with David Beckham. Heath apparently befriended the Beckhams when they visited her salon, and was asked to come wax and spray-tan the couple at their own home. </p> <p>Heath's account bore the hallmarks of authenticity - references to David's taste for Body Shop Body Butter and intimate depilation, in the same way as Wayne Rooney's cowgirl courtesan brought a touch of gritty realism to her kiss-and-tell with her talk of beef and tomato Pot Noodles. </p> <p>In one memorable interlude, however, Heath tells how she was flown to Madrid to tan the England captain prior to a photoshoot. \"We went down to the kitchen to spray on the tan,\" recalls Heath, whose beautician training evidently did not encompass food hygiene. \"After we did the tan, I said I wanted to go to bed and he asked if I wanted him to come up ... He crept in about half an hour later.\" </p> <p>So far, so scintillating. However, if at this point we apply the Legally Blonde line of attack, Heath's tale falls apart. David Beckham is no stranger to tanning treatments. He would, therefore, have known the instruction that in the hours after application, he must indulge in no activity that might cause perspiration, else the tan will streak. </p> <p>With this in mind, can we really be expected to believe that Beckham followed Heath upstairs a mere half an hour after his application? Can we accept that, in these circumstances, he held her \"tight\"? Finally, can we truly countenance the idea that Heath could stomach the intense aroma of digestive biscuits that accompanies the application of any fake tan? Your honour, I rest my case.<br><b>Laura Barton</b></p> <p> <b> Mad about Vladimir</b><br> </p> <p>They have had the Putin spy novel, the Putin doll, the Putin pop song, the Putin theme cafe. But no matter how vivid the simulacra of the president's image, it seems it was still not enough for a doting public. So now Russians can get closer to the endlessly enigmatic and mysterious roots of a KGB officer turned president by going on a tour of his home town. </p> <p>Since Putin came to power in 2000, St Petersburg has been lavished with refurbishments and attention from the Kremlin. Yet it is not this freshly painted capital of Russian culture around which Irina Lyapina provides tours. Her patch is the backstreets and alleys where the young son of an engineer grew up. </p> <p>Lyapina considers her role a non-profit enterprise, a sort of \"humanitarian aid for people\", and she is shy of talking about it. She told the Gazeta newspaper: \"I thought of the idea a few years ago. I was sure that people from all over the country wanted to know more about our president.\" </p> <p>The old, rusting Soviet town upon whose streets Putin fought and played is now unrecognisable, as I discovered whenI took a similar tour. I was accompanied by Putin's old judo trainer, Anatoli Rakhlin, a small, neat and senior man, who drove me round in his luxury Mercedes. </p> <p>We stopped outside the headquarters of a gas transportation business in Baskov Pereulok, a street whose buildings are adorned with ornate pre-revolutionary architecture. Inside the courtyard of number 21 is the tiny communal flat where Putin grew up. Rakhlin led me up a flight of stairs to the place where he is convinced that Putin lived and pointed to the dark brown door that led into the flat. He told me: \"It was an old house with a dirty, unlit entrance. Their [single] room was immaculate - extremely clean and orderly.\" </p> <p>A few streets away is the grammar school where Putin's penchant for political leadership first emerged. As his social history teacher, Tamara Stelmajova, explained, Putin took on the role of class \"polit-informer\", which meant he had to make a weekly presentation to his classmates on global and domestic politics. Even today, the school - like the rest of Russia - brims with the president's image, its walls lined with portraits by faithful students: Putin skiing, Putin in class, Putin with his imagined, and of course unnamed first love. </p> <p>The imagery is striking, as is much of the architecture that the tour takes in. But in the same way we'll never know who Putin's sweetheart really was, the closed doors and enchanted myths of St Petersburg do little to bring us closer to who Putin really is.<br><b> Nick Paton Walsh</b></p> <p><b> I speak your text</b><br> </p> <p>\"Gay boy,\" said an automated female voice down my home phone. Then I was asked if I'd like to hear the message again. Oh, I suppose so; go on then. \"Gay boy,\" she confirmed. </p> <p>My phone had rung normally, I had picked it up, and there had been that pause that usually means you're about to be told you've definitely won a big prize, or persuaded that all your windows need replacing. But no, there was a message for me. To hear it I needed to press 2, and it was at that point that the lady computer had disputed my sexuality. </p> <p>A few minutes later I got a text message on my mobile. \"Gay boy,\" it said (I was starting to get used to this). What grabbed my attention was not so much the question of why this (rather unreconstructed) person was saying I was gay. Rather, the interesting thing was that he had texted my home phone at all. He soon realised what he had done and texted my mobile too, but he needn't have bothered; his original misfired message had already been read out to me. </p> <p>Maybe everyone knows this, but I didn't: BT now send texts to home phones. The service is called the SMS text-delivery system and it works with most mobile networks. You text someone's landline and an automated voice reads it out to them. It costs the same as a normal text message, and it's hilarious - for about half a day. </p> <p>Yes, of course, I immediately wondered how foul-mouthed this lady computer would be. The answer was very. She'll say anything: F words, C words, the lot. She does have a problem with \"twat\", which comes out as \"twot\", but otherwise Miss SMS Text-Delivery System can cuss like Calamity Jane. </p> <p>I tested her pronunciation on some difficult words. She was perfect - the only one that tripped her up was chthonic, but I hardly ever use that in texts anyway. </p> <p>Just think how this could revolutionise your life. Imagine the situation: you have a friend you need to tell something to, and you want to text him because you don't feeling like talking right now, but he doesn't have a mobile. Well, now you can. Even if you want to say that, because of your psoriasis and eczema, you can't go to Leicester. You twot.<br><b>Sam Wollaston</b></p>",
  "<p> Technically impressive and a little quirky, the <a href=\"http://www.gizmondo.com/flash.asp\">Gizmondo</a> is a gaming handheld that has one unique feature - it's British. Launching in the UK on <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/09/10/gizmondo_uk_launch/\">October 29th</a>, the Gizmondo is an interesting and feature-packed device that plays movies and music as well as games. I had a test of one today and was impressed by the screen and capabilities of the device. The menu is easy to use and the features will be familiar to users of high-end PDA. Unfortunately the Gizmondo is no looker. In fact next to the sleek lines of the PSP, the Gizmondo looks like a tubby toy. Still looks aren't everything right?</p> <p>The Gizmondo doesn't allow you to make calls \u2013 \"too confusing for consumers\" say the makers - but owners will need a Sim card. GPS is crucial to the device and opens up some interesting game design areas. One of the titles in development \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.gamingheadlines.co.uk/view.asp?id=487&amp;p=giz&amp;d=tiger-telematics\">Colors</a> \u2013 lets players compete against other each other when in the same vicinity. You may be \"in control\" of a particular postcode, but a challenger can come to your area and \"win\" control by beating you in the game. Like most things Gizmondo this is an innovative, yet risky, choice. Critical mass will be needed to make the most of this game and that could be tough when retailers haven't exactly backed the machine wholeheartedly. However, a recent announcement of a deal with SCi shows that games support is growing, while a similar movie deal is expected shortly.</p> <p>The Gizmondo is ugly and ridiculously named, But it comes stacked with features, a reasonable price tag (\u00a3229) and genuine underdog spirit. I think this is a cult gadget in the making.</p>",
  "<p>The British governors wearing tall hats with white feathers may have gone, but under Chinese rule Hong Kong remains Asia's answer to Hollywood, with money top of the bill. In this eternal gold rush town, the competition never ceases. Alarm clocks don't come with snooze buttons; no one sleeps late here, or misses a mobile phone call. </p> <p>They take their cue from their towering monuments to capitalism - the cloud-piercing skyscrapers that stack Hong Kong Island like a pile of bank notes - the latest, Two IFC, a truly stunning 420-metres high structure, the fifth tallest building in the world. The Hong Kong Chinese travel on ridiculously cheap public transport to work in some of the world's most expensive office blocks. Mirrored buildings tower over ramshackle market stalls with corrugated iron roofs. The trendiest restaurants are often situated next to street side vendors selling steamed dumplings. At traffic lights, brand new silver Mercedes brush up next to old ladies with bent backs pushing old carts. </p> <p>It's precisely Hong Kong's mix of ancient culture and new technology that makes this former British colony such a great film set. Just about everywhere in Hong Kong will have been used as a film backdrop at one point or another, whether it's a scene from a James Bond film or a taut John Woo thriller. If visitors to Hong Kong are hit with an acute sense of deja vu when they arrive; well, they have probably seen it before - in the cinema. </p> <p> Even though the new martial arts film, Hero, was shot in mainland China, using locations such as Sichuan, Gansu and Inner Mongolia, Hong Kong remains the leading light of the Chinese film industry. The city is the world's third largest movie industry after Hollywood and Bollywood and movie making has changed dramatically since the days of The World of Susie Wong, when the production team had to import all lights and heavy equipment from London. Nowadays top quality studios, cast, cameras and costumes are now all located in Hong Kong. </p> <p>\"Film makers who want to use Hong Kong as a location for their movies now need only bring their suitcases!\" says legendary Hong Kong producer Charles Wang, who produced The World of Susie Wong and more recently, Rush Hour II. </p> <p>Hong Kong has some of the most instantly recognisable sights in the world - whether it's the futuristic skyline, the garish neon of Kowloon at night - an urban firework display that doesn't require any matches - or indeed its transport systems. Where London has black taxis and red Routemaster buses, and New York its yellow taxis, Hong Kong does trams and ferries.</p> <p>Scenes from Hong Kong action films have been lovingly shot aboard moving trams, with or without the consent of the authorities. The trams have operated the same 13km stretch along Hong Kong Island's waterfront since they were introduced a century ago. Today, however, the harbour is invisible for almost the entire journey, which gives some idea of Hong Kong's love affair with reclamation. Early on local rickshaw pullers were quick to make full use of tram tracks and adjusted their wheel gauges so their two-wheeled handcarts could run along the tramlines. </p> <p>When the tram's spiral staircases were introduced in the 1970s they proved an immediate hit among male passengers. There was fierce competition for the seat at the bottom of the stairs, which provided the best views from which to admire the cut of the fashionable miniskirts of the day, although screens were subsequently built to curtail this attraction.</p> <p>Even older than the trams is the much-loved Star Ferry that connects Hong Kong Island with the Kowloon peninsula. The ride is still a steal, a criminally cheap form of transport especially compared with places like London. It's about 15p one-way but always worth upgrading to the upper deck for an extra five pence. Hong Kong is a city that gets passionate about things, whether it is democratic rights, movies or its public transport pricing system.</p> <p>And, in true Hong Kong style, the turnaround of films is pretty quick too with many movies often released in cinemas just weeks after completion. Bey Logan, a stuntman and film producer, says: \"In Hollywood, more is said than done, but here it's the other way round - more is done here than said. In Hong Kong, it's 'action' and the next day you've got a finished movie.\" </p> <p> <strong>Top film landmarks </strong></p> <p><strong>Kowloon waterfront:</strong> a new 440-metre Hollywood-style Avenue of Stars walk of fame celebrates over 20 well-known Hong Kong film personalities, including superstar actor Jackie Chan, actress Michelle Yeoh, and cult director John Woo. There's also a plaque in honour of the late martial arts legend, Bruce Lee, although hardcore fans are lobbying authorities to build a bigger memorial. </p> <p><strong>Two IFC: </strong>Hong Kong's tallest skyscraper in the heart of Central saw Angelina Jolie, as kick-boxing archaeologist heroine and lycra-clad Lara Croft, leap from the top of here in Tomb Raider II: The Cradle of Life. </p> <p> <strong>Mandarin Oriental Hotel:</strong> the popular Hong Kong actor/singer Leslie Cheung jumped to his death from the 24th floor of this swanky Central hotel in April 2003. Police found a note saying he was suffering from \"emotional problems\". Critics loved his portrayal of the gay opera singer in the 1993 classic Farewell My Concubine. </p> <p><strong>Victoria Harbour:</strong> Hong Kong's most popular tourist attraction and still probably the greatest view of the city. The harbour was used as a backdrop in James Bond's The Man with a Golden Gun and the opening scene in Rush Hour II. </p> <p> <strong>Repulse Bay:</strong> walk along the beach here on Hong Kong Island's south side, where scenes from the 1950s weepy Love Is A Many Splendored Thing was filmed. </p> <p> <strong>Wanchai:</strong> the area synonymous with The World of Suzie Wong, the famous east-meets-west tale of love starring William Holden and Nancy Kwan. Wanchai's lively covered wet market nearby is a bit like Sea World-on-a-slab; barring the really big fish, everything that has ever lived in the sea is available here. Jackie Chan fans may recognise the place from Rush Hour II. </p> <p><strong>SoHo:</strong> Every great city has a Soho too, and in Hong Kong it's named after the district South of Hollywood Road. Hong Kong's foremost late-night entertainment area was the location for Chungking Express, starring Tony Leung. </p> <p><strong>Pottinger Street:</strong> the scene of a gun fight in Infernal Affairs, the tale of an undercover cop assigned to infiltrate a notorious triad gang which has since spawned two acclaimed sequels. Brad Pitt is currently considering a starring role in Martin Scorsese's remake of this Hong Kong police thriller. </p> <p><strong>Miramar Hotel, Kowloon: </strong> before he made it big, actor Chow Yun-Fat was a hard-working bellboy at this hotel on Nathan Road. </p> <p><strong>Hong Kong International Airport:</strong> even your journey home is not without a movie location or two as scenes from Rush Hour II were shot here. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>The Hong Kong tourism board has launched an Odyssey Guide, a new movie map of the territory, featuring well-known film landmarks and is available from all tourist information centres in Hong Kong.

  "<p>Caesars Entertainment, the Las Vegas-based owner of Caesars Palace, has announced plans to build a hotel-casino next to Wembley Stadium, in a \u00a3334m joint project with UK property group Quintain Estates and Development.</p> <p>The hotel, Caesars Wembley, will be a 650,000sq ft (60,000 square metre), nine-storey, 400-room building built on a 13 acre (5.3 hectare) site. It will feature a spa and swimming pool, a collection of designer shops, convention and meeting facilities, along with restaurants, bars and lounges. </p> <p>The casino will boast 75,000sq ft of gambling space, with 135 tables and 1,250 slot machines.</p> <p>The 50/50 joint venture is contingent on planning permission and deregulation of UK gambling laws, which is expected to be passed by parliament next year. Building is due to begin once the legislation goes through, and should be finished by the end of 2008 - two years after the new national stadium holds its first FA Cup Final. </p> <p>Wembley is also a key part of London's bid for the 2012 Olympics, and the Football Association hopes it could feature in future World Cup tournaments.</p> <p>Quintain, which was a joint developer of the Millennium Dome, owns 58 acres of land in Wembley surrounding the stadium, and was last month given approval by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for a \u00a31.3bn development to build 3,700 homes on 42 acres of brownfield land.</p> <p>Today's announcement represents the second stage of Wembley's redevelopment. Under the deal, Quintain will provide the site, and Caesars will put in cash to the value of the land. The rest of the project will be funded through debt and cash from each company.</p> <p>Nick Shattock, Quintain's property director, said: \"Wembley is recognised in the Mayor's London plan as an international leisure destination. We are delighted to be working with Caesars, a leading global brand. Together, we are providing Wembley with another world-class facility in one of the largest mixed-use urban regeneration schemes in the UK.</p> <p>\"People in the past came to Wembley an hour before kick off and left as soon as they could get out of the car park. We want to change that ... we want to create a day out for them.\"</p> <p>The deal marks Caesars' first foray this side of the Atlantic. The company said the area would be a natural attraction for tourists, with the hotel overlooking concert venue Wembley Arena, as well as being just 200 metres from the 90,000-seater stadium.</p> <p>Wallace Barr, Caesars Entertainment president and chief executive, said: \"Wembley promises to become one of Europe's top new leisure destinations. With that in mind, it is a natural location for our first European casino project.\"</p> <p>It is less than a month since the government published the latest plans to deregulate the gambling industry, saying high-stakes machines would only be allowed at the largest of casinos - a move which analysts said would favour the big American operators. </p> <p>\"You will have a Las Vegas experience. It will not be of the scope and size of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas ... but it certainly will have the quality,\" Mr Barr said.</p> <p>The Las Vegas Caesars Palace has around 2,500 rooms, a 129,000 sq ft casino, a 4.5 acre pool complex, 22 restaurants and two shopping centres.</p> <p>At 2.50pm, Quintain shares were up 5.75p at 465.75p.</p>",
  "<p>The spectacular victory by John Howard's Liberal Democrat party in the Australian elections - which brought them not only an increased parliamentary majority, but also control of the Senate - left many left-leaning voters feeling somewhat stunned.</p> <p>\"Well, well, well...\" muses Grant Young in the <a href=\"http://www.synapsechronicles.com/\">Synapse Chronicles</a>. \"Bitterly disappointed would be an apt description of how I feel about the election. And pretty fucking scared about what's going to happen next. It's going to take a lot of work to undo what is about to happen - I could have handled the Libs in the House of Reps, but now that they also control the Senate, we have lost the last remaining safeguards that we had politically from the mess that the Liberals have been trying to inflict.\"</p> <p>So where did Labor, the main opposition party, go wrong (again)?</p> <p><strong>George Wright</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://chrenkoff.blogspot.com/\">Chrenkoff</a> offers to help non-Australian readers out with the answer to this one. \"Labor tried to make an issue of the fact that John Howard, now 65 years old, did not explicitly commit himself to serving the full three year term as Prime Minister and would probably sometime in the near future step down in favour of his deputy, Treasurer Peter Costello. </p> <p>\"So Labor ran a campaign to the effect that if you vote for Howard, you will get Costello. What Labor failed to realise was that many (swinging voters in particular) were more concern that if they vote for [Labor leader] Mark Latham, they will get Latham.\"</p> <p>Mr Howard's resounding win came despite mass protests against his administration's support for the US-led war. In the end, most commentators agree, Iraq was not as big an issue as expected.</p> <p>Instead, voters made their decisions based on issues much close to home - and in particular their wallets. </p> <p>As Antony Green, writing in the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/10/1097406429837.html?oneclick=true\">Sydney Morning Herald</a>, explained: \"Howard nailed the key issue with his first speech of the campaign. His refrain, 'Who can you trust to maintain a strong economy?' and 'Who can you trust to keep interest rates low?', was repeated ad nauseam throughout the campaign, but that did not diminish their impact.\"</p> <p><strong>George Wright</strong></p>",

  "<p>Capital Radio today won permission to merge two radio licences that were set up to serve two separate black communities in London. </p> <p>In an unprecedented step, media regulator Ofcom has given the radio station the go-ahead to unify the two London licences - in Brixton and in north-east London - in a move set to anger black communities.</p> <p>Capital said it wanted to use Choice's \"credibility in coming from Brixton and the black community\" to turn Choice FM into the nation's premier urban music brand with a \"broader\" audience. And as a first step it is combining the north and south London licences of Choice to create a single unified station.</p> <p>It will also move the station from its base in Brixton, where it maintain close links with the community, to Capital's corporate HQ in Leicester Square, central London.</p> <p>But the editorial director of black newspaper New Nation, Michael Eboda, said merging the licences would move Choice ever further away from its original remit as a community station.</p> <p>He believes Capital does not want the station's original African-Caribbean audience and that the radio giant was \"paying lip service\" to the black community by having Choice founder Patrick Berry as chairman.</p> <p>\"Ever since Capital's takeover Choice has been going away from its remit to be a community station providing access for the community to music they can't hear on any other legal station,\" he said.</p> <p>One of Capital's first signals of intent as it seeks out a broader audience is the signing of TV presenter Richard Blackwood as a weekend DJ at Choice and the axing of the specialist African Beats show from the new schedule, which starts on October 18.</p> <p>The Choice managing director, Graham Bryce, denied there would be less specialist music broadcast on the new station.</p> <p>\"We are trying to keep 99% of specialist music in our output. I think we'll provide London with better specialist shows which before were only available in north or south London,\" he said.</p> <p>But Mr Bryce admitted the new unified schedule meant some shows would have less on-air time and some would be axed.</p> <p>\"We have juggle the hours a bit. A couple of specialist shows will have an hour less and a couple of one-off shows from the weekend have not made it on [to the new schedule].\"</p> <p>He said the African Beats show was being replaced by Choice UK Cuts, a show promoting British urban music which Capital is to use as a launch-pad for a wide-ranging volley of initiatives for Choice.</p> <p>Mr Bryce also said there were plenty of black presenters on the station with deep community links, name-checking Angie Le Mar, Jigs, Master Stepz, DJ 279 and Kat, who will co-host with Blackwood on his new show.</p> <p>\"Choice has got the credibility of the audience and the urban music scene. It is the only radio station in the country that is a pure urban music station. It has the credibility of coming from Brixton and the black community, and that's why Capital bought it. We can use our resources to build on that,\" he said.</p> <p>He said Capital intended to grow Choice in a similar way to its expansion of alternative music station Xfm into a national brand, which Mr Bryce also masterminded. But Choice's expansion into a national brand will be done by increasing its digital radio coverage rather than by bidding for analogue licences.</p> <p>Ofcom said that it has changed the licence format to stipulate that there must be at least 21 hours of specialist music on Choice. Previously the north London licence had a four hour stipulation for specialist music and the south London licence had none, but both stations played much more specialist music than formally required.</p> <p>The regulator said Choice will also still be required to provide news and information specific to each community.</p> <p><strong>Capital 'doesn't want' Choice audience</strong><br></p> <p>Mr Eboda said the black community feared Capital intended to move the station away from its roots when it took over Choice, and it promptly got rid of 'The Voice of Choice' [breakfast show co-host and Saturday talk show presenter] Geoff Schumann and decreased a reggae show's slots.</p> <p>\"Capital want to change the audience. Choice was a genuine community station and well-liked, but it isn't now. They [Capital] don't want its listeners any more. </p> <p>\"This 'urban' tag is very inclusive, it means all races, all young people, but before the station was aimed specifically at the afro-Caribbean audience and that's gone,\" said Mr Eboda.</p> <p>New Nation's parent company, Ethnic Media Group, which owns five titles including Caribbean Times and Eastern Eye, said it was looking at picking up where Choice leaves off. \"Choice has left a gap. It's something we're keen at looking in to,\" said Mr Eboda.</p> <p>The Choice chairman, Patrick Berry, the founder and managing director of the station until Capital's takeover, said it was his \"long held ambition\" to create a London-wide radio station.</p> <p>\"It means that all listeners can get the best of Choice right across the capital and is an important platform to develop the brand nationally.\"</p> <p><strong>From run-down Brixton flat to Leicester Square</strong><br></p> <p>Mr Berry founded Choice in a run-down building in Brixton where it operated as a community service offering music, information and job opportunities for a population that felt disenfranchised by established stations such as Capital.</p> <p>It fought for years in vain to get a second licence to cover the region around Finsbury Park, north London, and felt there was strong bias towards the mainstream groups such as Emap and Chrysalis at the now defunct Radio Authority.</p> <p>Following several attempts to prove its worth with 28-day restricted licence services it got a second licence for north London but with a different format to Choice in Brixton, whose format promised soca, gospel, rap, R&amp;B and reggae. The north London licence was awarded on the promise it would play soul, dance, R&amp;B and reggae.</p> <p>But when Capital took full control of the station in March 2004, it asked Ofcom to unify the licences, which the media regulator has now approved.</p> <p>Capital has just announced a \u00a3711m merger with Classic-FM owner GWR amid assurances that they would preserve plurality on the airwaves.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the station said the move to unify Choice's licences will give Choice a broader appeal and would attract bigger names as presenters as well as allowing advertisers easier access to the station.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>Town</strong><br> \"Few towns are less prepossessing at first glance than Reading but few towns better repay exploration.\" So said John Betjeman. At least he was nicer about Reading than he was about Slough. You do have to wonder about a place that boasts its proximity to other, more picturesque, places - Windsor, Henley, the Chiltern Hills, the Berkshire Downs, and London, of course.</p> <p>Reading is the buckle on the commuter belt. But, as Betjeman pointed out, it's not that bad. Prosperous, home to many major corporations, handsome in its Victorian parts, and site of Reading young offenders centre - or Reading gaol of ballad fame: a nearby mural celebrates Oscar Wilde's life and work.</p> <p><strong>Gown</strong><br> The Reading milieu is surprisingly beautiful: the main Whiteknights campus was formerly the ground of a stately home owned by the Marquess of Blandford, and is 320 acres of landscaped park bordering the town centre. The smaller but similarly attractive London Road campus is the original home of the university and still plays host to graduation ceremonies. Modern buildings at Bulmershe campus are home to the institute of education and the school of health and social care.</p> <p><strong>Top-rated teaching departments</strong><br> Outdoorsy types rejoice: agriculture and meteorology are very well regarded; film and drama, nursing, psychology, physics and philosophy also do well.</p> <p><strong>Top-rated research departments</strong><br> Psychology, environmental sciences, English literature and language, Italian and archaeology all got a 5* in the 2001 RAE.</p> <p><strong>Celebrity academics</strong><br> If you want to know if I, Robot is likely to happen, try Kevin Warwick, professor of cybernetics, who works on intelligent robotics, intelligent control and artificial life.</p> <p><strong>Head count</strong><br> There are 18,000 students: 54% of them are women and 81% are from state schools. Of 1,126 academic staff, 63% are male.</p> <p><strong>Academic pay</strong><br> Slightly variable, but never worse than average. Science professors do well, on around \u00a351,000. Language lecturers are more restrained on \u00a329,000, and arts researchers are bang in the middle of the league tables on \u00a321,000.</p> <p><strong>Climate</strong><br> It's just your regular weather, but it's monitored by the country's best meteorology department, which gives it a certain something.</p> <p><strong>Transport links</strong><br> Good for getting around, if a little congested. Tread the well-worn path to London - 25 minutes on the train, or just under an hour in the car (along the M4). Or for somewhere a little more sedate, it's half an hour on the train to Oxford, just over that by car.</p> <p><strong>Entertainment</strong><br> Reading festival is the highlight of many a young (and not so young) music fan's year. If that's not quite your cup of tea, try the Womad festival of music and dance from around the world. Otherwise, Reading offers standard fare: lots of pubs and bars; a few museums (including the university's Museum of English Rural Life); and the Hexagon, a venue for big-name tours and shows. The Reading Film Theatre provides indie contrast to the multiplexes and the recently revamped town hall complex give further concert space. Reading's very proud of its shopping centre, the Oracle shopping and leisure complex.</p> <p><strong>Schools</strong><br> Look for something with Caversham in the name to start with: Caversham Park and Caversham primary schools are both good. After that, in a slightly below average LEA you might be tempted to go for one of the selective schools, Reading school and Kendrick girls' grammar school are both good. If not, try Highdown.</p> <p><strong>House prices</strong><br> Anywhere this close to London is going to have you wheezing in the mortgage adviser's chair, but Reading isn't so bad, really: detached houses average \u00a3376,000. Average semis are \u00a3210,000 and terraces are \u00a3165,000.</p> <p><strong>What to say in the common room...</strong><br> \"I know not whether Laws be right, or whether Laws be wrong.\" (From the Ballad of Reading Gaol.)

  "<p><strong>Dawn Primarolo (paymaster general)</strong>: The UK currently lies 27th out of 30 OECD countries for participation in education at age 17. Our ambition is to move from being one of the lowest to one of the highest-ranked countries for the training of young people. We know there are innumerable barriers to education and training for those over 16 years. Financial support should not be one of them. The aim of our review is to encourage, support and incentivise people to remain in education and training for as long it takes. </p> <p> Skills are important for life chances, but it is also about the country's flexibility, productivity and competitiveness - all the things that you would expect the Treasury to emphasise. I want to thank Centrepoint for its invaluable support in the review. One of the hallmarks of the consultation is the way that Centrepoint got us to involve young people themselves in the consultation, and those discussions are now shaping the future. </p> <p> <strong>Anthony Lawton (chief executive of Centrepoint)</strong>: It's really important to enable young people to make choices about how to learn, grow, live their lives, and become independent in ways that are not driven by particular sets of administrative rules and definitions. </p> <p> Interestingly, most young people we have talked with want to be able to claim benefits at 16 and not 18. But they also want a system that enables them to remain in appropriate contact with their families. We need to get the balance right so that we are fostering a healthy interdependence for young people. </p> <p> <strong>John Ransford (director of education and social policy at the Local Government Association)</strong>: We've got to start by responding to people's needs, rather than defining the problem in organisational terms. There's a real tension between the coordination of activity that focuses on the needs of the individual and the fragmentation of the organisational structure we've got. When I started in local government, almost all services for young people were part of the local government field. They are all fragmented now. But that has not actually improved the level of support. </p> <p> <strong>Pam Hibbert (policy officer at children's charity Barnardo's)</strong>: If you talk to young people, that fragmentation is really obvious. The number of places they have to go to tell their story is very concerning. But there are some good examples where those services have been bought together. </p> <p> <strong>Tom Wylie (chief executive of the National Youth Agency)</strong>: The government's five-year education strategy spoke about an \"integrated youth offer\". We need to ensure this \"offer\" is not just a set of services, but has financial incentives built into it. It is also a matter of the capacity of young people to do things. Too many services are highly client-focused with young people as the beneficiaries. It ought to be balanced with building a sense of agency in the young to take action. </p> <p> <strong>Simone Common (divisional manager for young people's services at Sunderland council)</strong>: Joint services are important but, for us, the big thing is the benefits system - not just jobseeker's allowance and income support, but also housing benefit. Trying to keep young people in education and able to access housing benefit has caused us massive problems, particularly with supported housing schemes. The remit of the review needs to go wider to include housing benefit. </p> <p> <strong>Primarolo</strong>: It is not that we are excluding housing benefit, but we already have a lot to address. We don't want to raise expectations beyond what it is deliverable. </p> <p> <strong>Common</strong>: There is still an issue for those young people who are forced into independence, and who can't live at home, but who need support to maintain education. </p> <p> <strong>Primarolo</strong>: If we tried to design a system that picked up the most vulnerable at every point where they were exposed, we would have a complex system that sounded all right, but couldn't deliver. </p> <p> <strong>Val Derbyshire (Co-operative group)</strong>:Young people in education shouldn't be penalised if they want to work. If someone wants to buy a Play Station, then they should be able to because it's their choice to work in their free time. </p> <p> <strong>Hibbert</strong>: A lot of young people are concerned about the prospect of benefit being paid to their parents, because many have fragile relationships with their parents. At the moment, they are getting \u00a340 paid to them. If benefit goes to parents, many of them wouldn't even have any pocket money. So that would remove their incentive to go into training. </p> <p> <strong>Hannah Lownsborough (researcher at thinktank Demos)</strong>: Some parents are sceptical about the value of training and education. And the signal that we send when our benefits system is confusing and difficult to access is that training is less good than getting a full-time job. </p> <p> <strong>Cliff Laws (manager of Derwentside citizen's advice bureau)</strong>: I've worked with the benefits systems for 16 years, and over that time, it has got more and more complicated. I've known people with law degrees who have struggled to fill in claims forms. There needs to be a simplification of the system to allow people to understand how to get into it - and out of it - when they choose. </p> <p> <strong>Hibbert</strong>: One of the issues for young people released from custody is the access to benefits. Even if they sign on on the day they are released, it can be six weeks before they get any money. So it's perhaps not surprising that they drift back into reoffending. </p> <p> <strong>Common</strong>: The big thing for many 16- and 17-year-olds is the proof of estrangement needed before they can receive any support. They are already in a crisis situation; the ability to keep cool when they challenged about their sensitive circumstances at home is very difficult. The different levels of entitlement also don't make sense. It's no cheaper to live independently at 19 than it is at 26, yet benefit rates are different. </p> <p> <strong>Primarolo</strong>: We want to get to a position where young people can make choices that are not being driven by incentives in the system. My experience has taught me that if you try doing too much, you end up doing nothing at all. So the trick is to recognise the complexity and start making the strategic changes that lead to a different system in the end. Let's not have too many objectives. Let's start with some, and deliver on them, and then move on. It's a complex piece of work. You've given me lots of things to worry about.</p>",
  "<p>Campaigners today warned that foster parents will continue to suffer from a postcode lottery of allowances until proposed legislation comes into force.</p> <p>The Fostering Network urged the government to ensure that a national system of minimum fostering allowances in England is introduced to even out the balance, and the children bill, which is being debated again in parliament today, does address the issue.</p> <p>Carers working under nearly half (46%) of English local authorities currently receive an amount below recommended minimum rates with many not getting their fostering expenses fully covered, according to the charity. </p> <p>As a result, the charity said, many carers are \"effectively subsidising the state\" despite government standards which say all carers should be reimbursed for the full costs of fostering. </p> <p>Publication of the survey of 113 local authorities coincides with the start of the House of Commons committee stage of the children bill, which includes an amendment to introduce a national system of minimum fostering allowances in England. </p> <p>If implemented and properly funded by government, this system would remove the current \"postcode lottery\" in allowances, the charity said. </p> <p>The charity proposes that minimum fostering allowances should start at a benchmark of \u00a3108.49 per week for a baby (higher in London) and vary according to the age of the child. </p> <p>The network's survey found that actual allowances start at around \u00a350 per week for the youngest children, with rates in neighbouring authorities varying by as much as \u00a3100 per week. </p> <p>Robert Tapsfield, executive director of the Fostering Network, said: \"There is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live. </p> <p>\"And with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in England, it's not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets. </p> <p>\"The government has the perfect opportunity to deal with this issue once and for all, and we urge them to ensure the amendment on a national system of allowances is accepted and implemented.\"</p>",
  "The government pledged today to overturn an attempt by peers to derail legislation that would effectively legalise gay marriage. <p>The equality minister Jacqui Smith said the House of Lords was aiming to \"wreck\" the plans when it extended new rights for same-sex couples to long-term carers and family members.</p> <p>She told MPs that the upper house's amendments would make the civil partnerships bill unworkable and said some of those who had backed them were anti-gay.</p> <p>The bill gives gays and lesbians the same right to form legally binding partnerships and enjoy some of the same tax and pension rights as married couples.</p> <p>But as it now stands, the legislation would give the same rights to carers and family members aged at least 30 and who have lived together for 12 years.</p> <p>Opening its second reading debate in the Commons, Ms Smith said the changes would lead to \"a myriad of legal absurdities\".</p> <p>\"A grandfather could leave a survivor's pension to a civil partner grandson. That turns pension provision on its head and could cost the taxpayer \u00a31bn a year.</p> <p>\"We could end up with a position where a son, in a civil partnership with his elderly mother, might lose entitlement to job seeker's allowance based on his mother's ability to support him financially. That takes our social security system back to the 1930s.</p> <p>\"And, even more bizarrely, if he then wanted to marry he would have to live separately from his mother for at least two years or have to prove her unreasonable behaviour.\"</p> <p>Labour's Chris Bryant, who is gay and a former Church of England priest, said peers who backed the changes did so \"because they don't believe that homosexuals are equal to heterosexuals and that includes, unfortunately, many of the bishops\".</p> <p>Ms Smith told him: \"What I hope today will happen is that people are honest about their motivation and I suspect that for some, you are right and that is their motivation.\"</p> <p>Alan Duncan, the only openly gay Tory MP, meanwhile gave his backing to the bill from the frontbench but pointed out that the party's MPs would enjoy a free vote on it.</p> <p>He said the Conservative leader, Michael Howard, backed the move and had pledged to vote in favour of civil partnerships.</p> <p>And he called for the rejection of the Lords amendment on carers, saying that it widened the scope of the bill, fundamentally changed its nature, creating \"at best bad legislation and at worst unworkable and damaging\" law.</p> <p>Urging its reversal, he said the bill wasn't about giving extra rights to gay people but removing discrimination which already existed.</p> <p>People today were \"relaxed and utterly unexercised\" by the idea of homosexuality but became \"deeply and profoundly indignant\" when they sensed intolerance, he said.</p> <p>That was why the bill had \"much wider support than those who are directly affected\".</p> <p>Mr Duncan said gay men and women were a fact of life. Some wished it were not so, but it was.</p> <p>He denied that civil partnerships amounted to \"gay marriage\" or undermined marriage, insisting the two institutions were on \"similar ... but parallel lines\".</p> <p>Mr Duncan said: \"The bill doesn't undermine or compete with marriage. We are, after all, not exactly fishing in the same pool.\"</p>",
  "<p>Medics have a name for the devastating injury that Christopher Reeve suffered during what was supposed to be just another day's riding in May 1995. They call it the Hangman's fracture, after those best known to have exploited its swift and almost guaranteed effect. </p> <p>When Reeve fell, he landed in such a way that his neck fractured high up, between the first and second vertebrae. It is one of the body's key weak points: sever the spinal cord so high up and not only does it stop nerve signals sparking between your brain and limbs, rendering you quadriplegic, it also cuts off nerve signals to your lungs. Without immediate attention, the Hangman's fracture causes death by suffocation. </p> <p>With luck, Reeve got help immediately, and at that point began his public transformation from superhero to a man half-reclined in a motorised wheelchair. </p> <p>But there was more to Reeve's transformation than the new limitations so visibly thrust upon him. He became a vocal advocate for the cutting-edge medical science of stem cell research. In stem cells, Reeve saw a powerful tool being hampered by US policy, a tool that not only promised potential therapies to heal himself, but to treat a host of medical conditions in others. \"He wanted every effort to be made on behalf of patients of all disorders that could potentially be helped by stem cell research,\" says Roger Pederson, an acquaintance of Reeve's and professor of regenerative medicine at Cambridge University. </p> <p>And Reeve made a difference. He campaigned in Congress. He was the public figure that brought the stem cell debate to the public. \"He was the human voice that changed attitudes,\" says Colin Blakemore, chief executive of the Medical Research Council. \"It's one thing for scientists to say, 'We know we can do this', but Christopher Reeve put all this into a real-life perspective.\" </p> <p>Reeve came to the stem-cell debate when the US was considering outlawing therapeutic cloning, a technique where stem cells are harvested from surplus fertilised eggs created in fertility clinics. Such embryonic stem cells, it is thought, can be turned into any of the hundreds of cell types in the body. To its supporters, few medical technologies have held more promise, as they could potentially be used to replace damaged and diseased cells anywhere in the body. To its critics - and in Washington, that meant many Republicans and the religious right - this creation of embryos is morally repugnant. </p> <p>Reeve saw the resistance as a challenge. \"His dream was to come to the UK, be treated with a whole repertoire of stem cell therapies - that is to say, making nerves from stem cells through therapeutic cloning. He then wanted to return to the US and walk off the plane and be arrested for having infringed US laws against therapeutic cloning,\" says Pederson. </p> <p>With an eye on the electorate, the Bush administration imposed strict controls on therapeutic cloning, declaring that while private institutions could do whatever they wanted, federal funds could only be used to research stem cells created before 2001. Without the full weight of federal funding behind it, Reeve and many scientists felt stem cell research had been scuppered. He set up the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation to fund some of the best research into therapies for paralysis, but research is an expensive business and the $15m (\u00a38.3m) a year the foundation dedicated to research was just a fraction the US National Institutes of Health could have paid for, if the Bush administration had allowed it. \"He was incensed by the quitter attitude of the Bush administration, which held back from exploring every possible avenue,\" says Pederson. </p> <p>Despite the restrictions in the US, which presidential candidate John Kerry has vowed to lift should the US electorate give him the chance, stem cell research continues at a fierce pace. Last year, the California-based company Geron announced they had used an injection of human embryonic stem cells to restore some function to rats who had had their spinal cords cut. The work, though promising, is still a lab study. In the real world, fractures are messy and when nerves are damaged in the spine, the injury site is quickly mobbed with cells that make nerve repair extremely difficult. </p> <p>Geron is arguably the world leader in trying to use stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries. But in other companies and universities, stem cells are being put through their paces to see if they can help treat conditions as disparate as Parkinson's, Alzheimers, diabetes and motor neurone disease. Others are using stem cells to correct irregular heart beats and salvage damaged retinas. </p> <p>In Britain, one of just a handful of countries to have firm legislation allowing therapeutic cloning to produce stem cells, only one licence has been granted for such research. Based at Newcastle University, Miodrag Stojkovich and Alison Murdoch of the Newcastle Fertility Centre hope to produce stem cells to study diabetes and Reeve's contribution to helping the public understand the merits of stem research is not lost on them. \"We will miss his contribution, especially where mediation of scientific progress to the public is needed, but we hope that we will go on where his dream stopped,\" says Stojkovich. </p> <p>Last month, Ian Wilmut, the scientist behind the team that cloned Dolly the sheep, applied for a licence to clone embryos to make stem cells, this time to treat motor neurone disease. If their application gets the green light from the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority, the body that polices such research in the UK, the team hope to begin work by Easter next year. </p> <p>If ever there were a flurry of activity in medical science, stem cells has to be it. In one week this month, two scientific teams reported successes with stem cells. In Israel, Izhak Kehat of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology created biological pacemakers for pigs, by implanting heart cells derived from human stem cells into their hearts. If the technique works in humans, it could make electrical pacemakers obsolete. Meanwhile the Massachusetts-based Advanced Cell Technology announced they had, for the first time, transformed stem cells into retinal cells. Transplanted into the eye, the company hopes that the cells could reverse some of the most common forms of blindness. </p> <p>Within the stem cell community, arguments still rage over whether funding should be skewed in favour of more versatile embryonic stem cells or the less ethically problematic adult stem cells. These provoke less ethical backlash because they can be extracted from people who are able to give consent. Bone marrow has long been known as a rich source of adult stem cells, and they are also found at the base of hair follicles, where they help stimulate hair growth. But scientists believe adult stem cells have a downside - they cannot be transformed into any kind of cell. Their role in the body has already, at least in part, been determined. More versatile may be stem cells taken from the blood of umbilical cords, though again, these have limits on what they can turn into. </p> <p>The balance of versatility versus acceptability is very different for embryonic stem cells. While scientists believe that these cells can truly form any other type in the body, that they must be extracted from a ball of 100 or so cells grown from a fertilised egg is viewed by some as morally objectionable. </p> <p>Many who have staked their futures on finding cures with stem cells are reluctant to say when real therapies will emerge, so when Reeve announced his desire to walk again, so soon after his accident, many saw it as the most wishful of thinking. According to Pederson, though, his hopes were not misplaced. \"It's probably 10 years off and that's the tragedy, that it hasn't happened in Christopher's lifetime. Now we must redouble our efforts to make sure these advances happen in the lifetime of people who need them and can benefit from them.\"</p>",
  "<p>As spooky locations go, St Pancras Chambers is among the spookiest. With its vaulted ceilings, peeling wallpaper, long, dim corridors and dank basement, the Victorian Gothic building - once the Midland Grand hotel, now Grade I-listed - reeks of must and menace. A perfect place, in other words, to film a psychological horror chiller such as Trauma. </p> <p>Which is why, on a cold morning last June, Colin Firth is skulking the building's corridors looking more like a tramp than the heartthrob that Pride and Prejudice made him. Dressed in scruffy jeans and jacket, he looks dishevelled and downbeat, playing a character who believes he is haunted by visions of his dead wife (Naomie Harris) who died in the car crash that he survived. He may also be a murderer, responsible for the death of a pop star whose body was found washed up in an east London canal. </p> <p>Equal parts Don't Look Now, Jacob's Ladder and Patrick McGrath's Spider, Trauma revolves around Firth's grief-stricken coma survivor who, attempting to get on with his life, moves into a flat in a converted hospital and is soon befriended by a neighbour, Charlotte (Mena Suvari from Americans Pie and Beauty), who is into crystals and all things spiritual, and who tries to help Ben find some peace. But as his tenuous grip on reality starts to loosen, we are left wondering not only about Ben's mental wellbeing, but whether the ethereal Charlotte may be another figment of his disturbed imagination. </p> <p>\"The beginning of the film is about grief, then changes to being a film about madness,\" says Trauma director Marc Evans, who helped start a mini-revival in British horror cinema with his last film, the inventive thriller My Little Eye. \"It's about loneliness, about someone whose grief kind of leads them to a kind of madness and a warped perception of the world.\"</p> <p>As the first film to emerge from The Ministry of Fear, the production company headed by former Edinburgh Film Festival director Lizzie Frankie, and devoted exclusively to horror - whose slate includes projects penned by Muriel Gray and novelist Kim Newman - many eyes are on Trauma to see whether it can deliver. Yet Evans doesn't see Trauma as being a horror movie per se. \"It's definitely in the zone of grown-up psychological thriller,\" he says. \"It's a film that takes itself seriously. It's not ironic. It doesn't play jokes with an audience. It starts with a concept: what if you lost your wife and you woke up on the day that the world was grieving for a Princess Di or Jill Dando, some kind of celebrity grief phenomenon?\"</p> <p>\"It is much more about mind games and paranoia and what might be frightening and what might be menacing,\" says Firth, during a break in filming. \"There will be a bit of boo as well. It's unashamedly trying to mess with your mind a bit.\"</p> <p>So how does Firth go about playing a man who is not in control of his senses? \"If you're playing a character who can't distinguish reality from fantasy, you have to use your judgment,\" he explains. \"If something seems real to you, you have to play it as if it's real. So in some ways it's perfectly simple. He thinks his wife's dead and then he sees her; thinks maybe she's alive, but he's not sure. You have to think yourself into that situation; it can be a fairly freaky thing. You certainly can't play a thing called madness, because nobody thinks they're mad.\"</p> <p>To help realise Trauma's altered sense of perception, and to drive home the sense of unease, Evans was keen to use odd, unsettling locations and show a view of London that hadn't been seen of film before. \"We were trying to create a certain idea of Canary Wharf and the City as this kind of malign, faceless modern East End, and then below that this kind of Gothic, almost Victorian place where Ben might live. The idea is he moved into a flat in a converted hospital, and maybe in a strange way he's never left the hospital during the whole film.\" Such a place initially proved difficult to find. \"We found a lot of interesting interiors but I kept feeling we didn't have the scale of, say, the Daykota Building in Rosemary's Baby.\"</p> <p>Evans eventually found what he was after in one of London's most well known landmarks - St Pancras Chambers. As the Midland Grand hotel, which opened in 1876, it had been famed for its then innovative features, among them its hydraulic, ascending chambers and revolving doors. Closed as a hotel in 1935, it remained in use as offices until the 60s when it was listed and saved from demolition, although it lost its fire certificate in the 80s and has been empty ever since. Although the exterior was renovated in the mid-90s, the interior has been seriously neglected - and this has proved popular with filmmakers, with The Madness Of King George, Richard III and even the Spice Girls' Wannabe video among those having filmed inside. For Evans it provided the perfect architectural feature for his film. \"We wanted a really long corridor because all films about people going mad have got long corridors in them,\" he laughs. \"There's one upstairs 250 feet long.\"</p> <p>According to Firth, the building is more than simply a visual metaphor for his character's descent into madness: its unsettling ambience has even seeped into his performance. \"It's doing all the work today as far as I'm concerned,\" he says. \"It looks paranoiac, if you light it right. So in many ways these are my days off. It's very rare that as an actor, you get any of the stimuli that your character would get, but they've managed to make the atmosphere so creepy at times.\"</p> <p>The building was always been one of his favourites, Firth admits. \"I'd been dying to get inside. It kind of surpasses expectations because it is just as kind of gloomy and ghostly as I'd hoped it would be, but is also more magnificent than I imagined. You can see squares where nasty paint has been taken off and underneath there's a piece of extraordinary Edwardian wallpaper.\" Of plans to renovate the building as a luxury hotel, he says: \"In a way it's almost a pity to do anything with it. It feels like what it must be like if you could go down on the Titanic.\"</p> <p>For Firth, Trauma was an opportunity not only to work with Evans again - the pair previously collaborated on the 1994 Ruth Rendell TV adaptation Master Of The Moor - but to shed the labels of period and romantic comedy, for which he has become synonymous for a while. \"It's the kind of film I love to go and see, and I haven't spent a lot of time doing the kind of films I love to go and see,\" he reflects. \"There have been a lot of romantic comedies made, and a lot have come my way, but I never go to them. This is something that interests me. It reminded me a little bit of some of the paranoia films that I liked in the 70s, some of the Polanski films, and things like Don't Look Now.\"</p> <p>Like his star Evans acknowledges the shadow that Don't Look Now, the Nicolas Roeg classic, casts over Trauma. Both films deal with the supernatural and the effects of grief. Both films trade in Gothic menace, a fractured narrative, the use of fragments of colour and cracked imagery to shock and dislocate. Both films rest on the reliability of the narrator. But one is a certified classic and the other is only released this month. </p> <p>\"It's almost as unhelpful as it is helpful to have a film that good as an influence, but it definitely inspires, to be in that territory,\" Evans says. \"I've kind of made myself a rule of never invoking other directors because you're never going to be as good as them necessarily. Having said that, it's very hard to have a conversation about genre films without talking about other genre films. That's the difference between them and art movies. No self-respecting art moviemaker would say they were trying to make a Tarkovsky film. Inevitably there are connections between genre films and there's a kind of British tradition you can aspire to, [which] Roeg represents par excellence.\"</p> <p>It was Evans' unfamiliarity with the genre that made My Little Eye so refreshing, as he brought an unsullied perspective to a well-worn formula, and made himself something of a star in the horror field as a result. So even if Evans doesn't see Trauma as a horror film, that is how it is going to be perceived. Is he comfortable being pigeonholed as a horror director? </p> <p>\"What I'm comfortable with is being allowed to work,\" he says with a wide grin. \"After House [Of America] and Resurrection Man I literally couldn't get arrested. I'd committed some crimes against filmmaking, as perceived by financiers; I had made films that were dark and didn't make any money. The great thing about genre filmmaking is that for someone like me who's not interested in social realism or social comedy, it's probably one of the places I could exist and be employed, because it requires imagination and intelligence and to play with ideas in a cinematic way. Financiers don't look at you askance because you've gone a bit weird on them. They want you to be weird. If that could be my only resting place, I'd be happy with that. If that meant I could make a film a year, I'd be very happy with that.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's been some time now since travellers struggling over Switzerland's St Bernard pass have required the help of large, huffing dogs with little casks of brandy tied round their necks.

Team America: World Police is easily the most riveting political satire of the year, if not the most entertaining, the silliest and the dirtiest.</p> <p>This unhinged parody of '80s action movies focuses on a gung-ho team of American special agents, played by marionettes, who are hell-bent on ridding the world of terrorists, even if it means toppling the Eiffel Tower and mowing down innocent civilians in the process. Featuring terrorists who mumble \"Jihad\" and \"Mohammed\" and puppets engaging in sexual positions never before seen at the Cineplex, Team America constitutes a generational litmus test like none before it. At the screening I attended, younger viewers laughed hysterically and emerged with huge grins on their faces, older viewers sat in silence and walked slowly from their seats, scowling. But your ultimate reaction to this film will no doubt depend entirely on 1) how many bad formulaic action movies you sat through in the '80s; 2) whether the word \"fuck\" makes you uncomfortable; and 3) how excited you are to see miniature replicas of self-righteous celebrities get their heads blown to smithereens.</p> <p>Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park, have created a visually stunning, wildly goofy but undeniably incisive critique of American culture and our role as global cops. Wall-to-wall absurdity from the first shot, it doesn't pull any punches, and even its Scooby Doo-like ending will have you laughing louder than you have at any of the limp comic offerings of the last few years.</p> <p>Unless, of course, you hate it.</p> <p>I met up with Parker and Stone in Beverly Hills, Calif., where our interview was the first in a two-day whirlwind of movie junkets for Team America. A day after Sean Penn attacked them publicly in a letter, and shortly after the movie finally received an R rating by the MPAA after making some required cuts (including, reportedly, a \"golden shower\" scene between marionettes), the two seemed slightly shellshocked, but were extremely easygoing and eager to talk about what's arguably their funniest, most ambitious work to date.</p> <p><strong>I saw Team America last night and, my God, I've never seen anything so obnoxious in my life.</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> [Laughs] My family's in town - my aunts and uncles - and I really don't even want them to see it.</p> <p><strong>Really?</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Not out of embarrassment, I just know they're gonna be confused.</p> <p><strong>I've never heard more hysterical laughter at a screening before in my life, but when I was walking out I saw a few older people with extremely grim looks on their faces.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Right. I don't think it's for older people.</p> <p><strong>And it's probably hard to translate it for them.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> I did an interview the other day with this college kid who was like, \"I think this movie will span generations! What would you say to an 85-year-old about the movie?\" I was like, \"Don't go see this movie. Because you'll be bummed out. It is not for you.\"</p> <p><strong>Are there ever people who say, \"Oh, I usually hate humor like this, but you guys do it so well.\" Or do people who hate this kind of humor just hate your stuff?</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Yeah, they hate our stuff. And they hate us.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> They hate us. But we haven't really had that many reactions to the movie yet. It's only been shown [in screenings] for the first three or four days, so we don't really know.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> We got some hatred yesterday from some of the foreign press people, who were like, \"This movie is so hateful!\" and \"How dare you?\" They basically wanted to use all their time to just try to slam us. And then I was thinking about it, and I thought, I guess if I didn't offend an uptight old German woman - I mean, if we can't offend her, we haven't done anything.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> At least we offended somebody.</p> <p><strong>Still, do you ever feel like you cover your asses too much by taking on targets on opposing sides?</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> I don't think so, because we do take somewhat of a stand at the end. I mean, I believe we do make a point at the end of the movie. Some people consider that point to be fairly right-wing, and some people consider it to be fairly left-wing ...</p> <p><strong>What do you think that point is?</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> [Laughs] The thing is, obviously, we're not setting out to make a movie going, Look, America, this is how you should run things, this is how it should be. Because then we'd be no better than the fucking actors we hate. But the only thing that we assert is that there's a difference between dicks and assholes. That's the biggest thing that we assert.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> That's such a strong political statement.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> And it really kinda is! Because that's the thing that we realized when we were making the movie. It was always the hardest thing. We wanted to deal with this emotion of being hated as an American. That was the thing that was intriguing to us, and having Gary (the main character) deal with that emotion. And so, him becoming ashamed to be a part of Team America and being ashamed of himself, he comes to realize that, just as he got his brother killed by gorillas - he didn't kill his brother; he was a dick, he wasn't an asshole - so too does America have this role in the world as a dick. Cops are dicks, you fucking hate cops, but you need 'em.</p> <p><strong>Thanks to all the assholes - or criminals. Or in the case of the movie, terrorists.</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Right. Because there are assholes - terrorists - you gotta have dicks - people who hunt down terrorists. And I think that that is a pretty strong thing to assert, actually ... at least the pussies think so.</p> <p><strong>The pussies being the whiny liberals. But you obviously make fun of dicks - or ugly Americans - for the first half of the movie.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Well, it's just Gary coming to terms with the fact that it's an imperfect world, basically. And this is Gary going, \"This is as much sense as I can make of it.\"</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Dicks are bad, and it sucks to be a dick, but it's way worse to be an asshole, and because there are assholes, we need dicks. So shut the fuck up, all you pussies!</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> That does seem like a funny way to put it.</p> <p><strong>What question are you dreading the most?</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Why marionettes?</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Why puppets? That's what everyone always says first thing. \"Why puppets, guys?\"</p> <p><strong>Better cross that one off the list ...</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Well, you always have the one question that you answer in every interview, to the point where we know that one of us is going to start the answer, and we know exactly what the other one is going to say ...</p> <p><strong>So it ends up feeling rehearsed.</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> It's the only thing that does, because we try to stay really conversational. Because there is a fascinating story behind it, which we won't tell you now.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Since you're not going to ask that.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> But because there is a specific story behind it, it gets told and retold.</p> <p><strong>OK, I shot myself in the foot. I'll just have to <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372588/trivia\">link to the story</a>. I'm wondering, do you ever take a break and eat some lunch and come back and say, \"Man, I'm not so sure about that part that goes 'Lick my butt and suck my balls'\"?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> No. Those are always the parts we're most sure about.</p> <p><strong>Although I did notice that, when you do the touching ballad-reprise of [the movie's theme song] \"America! Fuck, Yeah!\" you didn't include the lyric \"lick my butt.\"</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> [Laughs] Oh yeah! That's true.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel that you seek to offend people, or do you find that insinuation offensive?</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> No, in fact, it's funny, I was talking to my parents about this ...</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> No, we're just offensive.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Yeah. I was all nervous last night because the movie was playing ... Like, we've never seen the whole movie.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> No one had ever seen it until last night.</p> <p><strong>Because you were cutting it to get the R rating?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Because of the schedule we were on, no one had ever sat down and actually watched the entire movie on film, with the sound mix, start to finish, until it played in however many theaters.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> I was really nervous, and my dad said, \"I don't understand why you're all nervous,\" and I said, \"I'm just really scared that people are getting really pissed off right now.\" Not scared, but just bummed out. And I realize that I really do - and I think Matt's the same way - if someone does really get offended by our movie, we don't feel good about it. We want people to love the movie, you know what I mean? Even psycho German lady the other day kinda bummed us out, you know? Because it was like, Come on, you didn't like it? Deep down, we want everyone to laugh and have a good time. We don't go, Oh, let's piss these people off.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> We just are offensive people. I mean, I offend people all the time in everyday life and I wish I didn't; I just fucking say the wrong thing.</p> <p><strong>What do you think creates a person who naturally offends by accident?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> When that person is just really charismatic and cool!</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> No, I think we just deal with everything with humor. Everything. We say all the time, \"I know that if one of us got cancer tomorrow, we would be joking about it.\" It's just the way we deal with stuff. A lot of people with no sense of humor think that that means that you just basically don't care about anyone or anything, and it's not true.</p> <p>Ultimately, I think we're both pretty optimistic people, too. A lot of this movie came out of, you're laughing at people because you're sort of saying, \"Dude, relax.\" You have the Michael Moores of the world and all these people telling you, \"These people are evil and America's going to be destroyed in a matter of five years!\" And it's just, to us, not that dire. It's like, you know what? Our lives are pretty fucking great. And a lot of the lives we see around us are pretty fucking great, and everything's gonna be OK. That's just our basic philosophy.</p> <p><strong>What about the people who'd say, Well, you've got to get out of your bubble and check out the world and see how fucked up things are for everyone else.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> It's about optimism, though. That's the big thing about the movie; that end message is about American optimism. And that's the difference between America and the rest of the world, because if you go to Europe, people are not optimistic about the future there. And Americans do have a naive optimism about that - it's not just us, and the fact that we live in this L.A. bubble - I think all Americans have this naive optimism and have for a long time. And a lot of times it's naive, and it's unfounded, and it's even wrong, but it's somehow that optimism that keeps America looking forward and trying to make the world better. And I really do think that's something that's unique to America that doesn't exist in a lot of the world.</p> <p><strong>And it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Exactly. A lot of times it fuels the good things. Sure, it's stupid, and a lot of times it's a big smile while eating a big shit sandwich, but you just keep going, you know?</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> But another thing that goes along with the optimism part of it is basically the idea of, well, if I'm not going to have a fucking great time and I'm not going to really appreciate and enjoy and say life is great, then there really is no hope. Because all of the hope for the world is that there can be a great life, and to me, I'm proof of that, that there can be a great life. And yes, it's all about trying to dole that out to as many people as possible, but it's also about, when you have a great country, and it all works, and your life is awesome, then be able to say so! But for some reason, it's almost taboo to say, My fucking life is awesome, and I have a great time, and I have a sweet house and a nice car. People are like [using a scolding voice], \"Hey, hey, hey, hey!\"</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Especially the richest people in the world, which we know some of in this town, you know? [Angry voice] \"The world is fucked up!\"</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Look, we were below middle class growing up, and I had a dream that someday things were gonna be better, and I assume that's the way it is in Third World countries. So, if you're not going to enjoy the dream, then there's no hope for anything.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> I think that when Trey wrote \"America! Fuck, Yeah!\" - that song? That, to me, encapsulates it. We could talk for hours about America's overzealous stance overseas, but there's also, you know, \"America! Fuck, Yeah!\" too. And somehow that song encapsulates an hourlong conversation. When people ask me, \"What's your attitude about America?\" I think of Trey's song. That's the perfect way to put it. It's awesome, and you have to admit it's also a little cheesily testosterone-driven at the same time ...</p> <p><strong>A little cheesily testosterone-driven?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Yeah. But. It's awesome.</p> <p><strong>After the movie's first scene, I really wondered if you could keep up that level of really sharp satire. Did you ever think, \"Ah, maybe we shouldn't put in the dick and asshole stuff, because we could make a piece of art that anyone could see and appreciate\"?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> [Laughs.] Nope. I wish that would've occurred to us earlier.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Although the tone of the movie did change completely after shooting that scene, because we shot that scene first. The script was written ... a bit more like \"South Park,\" but even a little more jokey than \"South Park,\" and I think it's good that we wrote it that way, because Paramount had to say, \"OK, comedy? Oh, this is a funny script.\" Whereas, this movie, as a script, there are so many times where, if you were reading the script, you'd say, \"Where's the joke?\" Because so much of the joke is coming off of [the marionettes] trying to do drama. So we had way more jokey-jokes in the script, more like fucking Adam Sandler jokes - I mean, not that bad, but ...</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> But joke jokes.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> And after shooting that first scene, we were like, Dude, we've gotta take all the jokes out of this movie.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Then we did a pass where there was not a single joke or laugh in the whole movie, it was kind of just a fucked-up, serious, weird satire. But that was no fun to watch, and we're no good at doing that kind of thing.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> So then we started putting all the pussy and dick stuff in.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> But then it became, saying that kind of stuff, but with the serious music, and the collision of the music and the tone? That became what the movie was about. I think that most people will get that, but there will be people that don't get that. And if you don't get that central conceit of the movie, you'll just hate the movie more and more and more.</p> <p><strong>Yeah, but screw those people, right?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Well, I agree, but that's what people have to get, or they're gonna be like, \"What the fuck is this crap?\" And that's generational.</p> <p><strong>Not spelling it all out clearly, though, makes it so much better than it would be if you connected all the dots.</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Oh, yeah. For sure.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> But I also think that's generational, because 85-year-olds didn't grow up watching \"Top Gun\" and all the other movies that have that kind of stupid structure seared into them.</p> <p><strong>I have to ask you quickly about <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com/penn.htm\">the letter from Sean Penn</a> (who, along with other Hollywood political activists like Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon, is satirized in the film), which was posted on Matt Drudge ...</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> We got it the day before, actually. He was nice enough to send it to us before he sent it to the world.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> I remember when I got it, thinking that it read like a fucking open letter. It doesn't really read like it's really to us. That was my first thing; I was like, this doesn't read like a private letter.</p> <p><strong>And then the next day it was an open letter.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Yeah! The next day it was open.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> I mean, I just don't understand. If he really is pissed, why would he do us that huge of a favor? I mean, seriously, there is nothing he could've done to help this movie more.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> He just proved that we nailed him so perfectly in the movie. Because if you read the letter what he says in the movie is exactly like what he would say in the movie.</p> <p><strong>It was actually the marionette that wrote you that letter! I like how he sets you two up in the letter as such losers. \"I remember seeing you at a party. I remember how you dropped my name to appear witty ...\"</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> By the way, we've never met him. You do meet a lot of people. We've met a lot, and maybe we've even forgotten some, but I would remember Sean Penn. We never met Sean Penn, either one of us.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> But when you read it, the letter comes from such a high place of arrogance, you know, [deep, serious voice] \"You guys are young guys! If you don't have children, you can't say anything about anything!\" And the whole voting thing. All we ever said was that we thought that uninformed people should not vote - on either side of the political spectrum. It doesn't matter who you're gonna vote for. If you really don't know who you're gonna vote for, or are uninformed, or haven't really thought about it? Just stay home. Don't let people fucking shame you into going to the polls.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> If you have absolutely no idea, fuck it.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> If you really don't know or you're just going to vote for George Bush because he's already in office, or you're gonna vote for John Kerry because he's on the cover of Rolling Stone, don't do that. That's lame. Just stay home. That's all we ever said.</p> <p><strong>Publicist:</strong> We really have to wrap up now.</p> <p><strong>Well, in parting, do you have a special message for all those undecided voters out there?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Stay home.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Don't vote!</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> And it's no big deal. If you don't want to vote, you don't have to. Fuck that vote or die shit. I hate that.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> About the writer: Heather Havrilesky is Salon's TV critic.

  "The outcome of the trial of seven Pitcairn Islands men on a string of sex charges was thrown into doubt yesterday after the defendants were told they could challenge the trial's legitimacy. <p>The judicial arm of the privy council, which is the highest appeal court for the island, granted the men's petition to appeal against Britain's jurisdiction over Pitcairn.</p> <p>The privy council also said the defendants could challenge the composition of the court trying the case and the applicability of the 1956 Sexual Offences Act, under which they are being tried.</p> <p>But the three law lords hearing the petition rejected an application by the defendants' lawyers to halt the trial.</p> <p>The registrar of the privy council said that it was too early to say when the appeal would be heard, but said that it would \"almost certainly be some time next year\".</p> <p>A spokesman for Richard Fell, the British high commissioner in the New Zealand capital of Wellington, who is also governor of Pitcairn, said authorities were still trying to clarify the \"full implications\" of the privy council's decision. </p> <p>\"It is unknown what the extent of the appeal might be and how it will affect the trials and their outcomes,\" the spokesman said. </p> <p>Previous appeals by defence lawyers against Britain's jurisdiction over the island, which lies halfway between New Zealand and South America and is Britain's last remaining territory in the Pacific, were rejected.</p> <p>Australia's Sky TV, reporting the development, said the lawyers argue that Pitcairn islanders arrived on the island in the 18th century as pirates after their mutiny on the British ship Bounty and therefore renounced all claims to British citizenship.</p> <p>Media on the island reported that the trials, which involve 55 charges of rape and sexual assault dating back to the 1960s, were proceeding as scheduled, though the privy council ruling opens the way for any convictions to be quashed.</p> <p>The cases against several defendants, including the island's mayor, have been heard over the past two weeks, but no judgements have been made. Two islanders have pleaded guilty to sex abuse but have not been sentenced. </p> <p>The trials follow investigations by British and New Zealand police into allegations island men have sex with underage girls, in one case a child of three years. </p> <p>One alleged victim, testifying by videolink to two courts set up in Pitcairn's community hall, said men on the island, which has a population of just 47, treated girls and young women like a \"harem\", though some of the island's women have defended the men, saying that consensual underage sex is normal there.</p> <p>Unusually for petitions to the privy council, the law lords will publish their reasons for granting the defendants the right to appeal, though this is not expected to be for several weeks.</p>",
  "<p>'Thank you. Thankyouthankyou thankyou. \" These are the first and last words you will hear, entering and leaving Tate Modern via the main Turbine Hall entrance, from today until March. Delivered with the disingenuous gratitude of a stage performer, and with the soulless garrulousness of an electronic greeter, their sincerity is suspect. Thanks for what? </p> <p>Stand still for a moment. Listen. The world is all a hideous clamour. The fifth Unilever Turbine Hall project, Bruce Nauman's Raw Materials, fills the space with a babble of declamations, interrogations and justifications. It comes at you in mounting waves; it whispers in your ear, it comes in shouts and incantations - suddenly an opera, or a radio in the background. Even though there is nothing whatsoever to look at - bar the 18 parallel pairs of speakers running the length of the Turbine Hall, several more on the far end wall, and one dangling from the roof over the bridge - Raw Materials is, almost, a sculpture. </p> <p>When Nauman announced he was doing a sound piece, I instantly imagined a single voice flooding the hall, saying something terse and threatening, or a discreet whisper emanating from an unexpected corner. Something, in other words, to delay us for a moment, and perhaps alarm or confuse us as we passed. But so many voices, so many alarms? Start walking - take your chances. </p> <p>We find ourselves revisiting the audio and verbal components of 21 of Nauman's works, made over a period of more than 30 years. They follow one another in carefully orchestrated sequence. Short, percussive, repeated single-syllable texts: Work Work; OK OK OK; No No No, paced between much longer works - extended dialogues, complex poetic texts, works whose jarring absurdities slowly harden into menace and confrontation. </p> <p>The experience is a little like treading water beyond the surf, riding the troughs and swells of sound, each work another wave. Swept along by an unseen current, you are towed into deeper water, until you find yourself amid a flotsam of old routines and riffs, half-remembered snatches of things, the wreckage of words. </p> <p>Nauman plays it all back obsessively, clinically, as though the listener might hear some secret, just like Beckett's Krapp with his dusty old spools of memories. But Nauman has used the most up-to-date equipment, adjusting the levels and attack of the voices so that the overall effect becomes intensely spatial. He has also said that he has ignored the original meanings and contexts of individual works in order to reinforce their musicality and emotional content. Both are considerable. </p> <p>Nauman's art is all of a piece. You could call this a retrospective in sound, but like everything else Nauman does, Raw Materials does more than replay old work. For Nauman, everything remains material, to be used and used again. He has said that he has never been interested in finishing anything. To use an almost Naumanesque phrase, he is never finished, and never finishes finishing. His works are propositions, to be tested in light of one another. Louise Bourgeois's Turbine Hall project - the first in the Unilever series, in 2000 - was called I Do, I Undo, I Re-do. It is the same for Nauman. </p> <p>Somewhere, a voice rasps: \" Get out of my mind, get out of this room ,\" insisting, over and over, like one of those mocking, repetitive thoughts that sometimes ensnare us in the night. This is the Turbine Hall as the interior of the artist's head. By the end of it, the voices have taken up residence in your head, too. Nauman's Raw Materials winded me; it left me, when I finally got out of there, more of a liability on the street than usual. </p> <p>Previous projects here have all provided visual spectacle or grand effect of one sort or another. Artists either live or die in the Turbine Hall. Juan Mu\u00f1oz called the space \"a killer\". Or, as Nauman's voices have it: \"Live and die, die and die, shit and die, piss and die ... fail and live, smile and live, think and live, pay and live ...\" His insistence on using the things about him is a genuinely creative and rigorous process: he mines the near-at-hand, even his frustrated pacing about, drinking coffee and wondering what on earth to do next. In any case, we only have one ageing body, one mind, only the old words. Even the title Raw Materials is derived from an earlier series, Raw Material, a number of video and sound pieces from 1990-91 that involve sound exercises for the voice. </p> <p>Roar Materials would have been as apposite a title, and is also just the kind of language game Nauman plays in the text piece You May Not Want to Be Here, read by a small child, who hesitates at a point when \"here\" is replaced by \"hear\". You hear the child's momentary wavering over the homonym, like a train switching tracks over a set of points. We do the same, time after time, as we make our way down the length of the hall. How strange that Raw Materials should open at the moment of the death of Jacques Derrida, the master of language games. </p> <p>Unaccountably, I found myself getting upset. This came as a shock. Tears are for wimps and Bill Viola fans. Yet there is something in the cumulative presence of the human voice that can lead one to feel lost, adrift in one's own life. This was also something Derrida thought about. To remember a voice is itself an act of mourning. </p> <p>Nauman's idea sprang, so I understand, from the constant low hum that leaks into the Turbine Hall from the working electricity substation that still occupies part of the south side of the former Bankside Power Station. Nauman has been extremely aware of the Turbine Hall as a chamber of sound, and the way noise both floods the space and is dispersed and distributed within it. Raw Materials is as much sculpture as anything else. It makes you, too, totally aware of the volume of the space and where you are in it. I became intensely conscious of my own body and its orientation - whether I was standing a little to the left or right, closer to or further from one speaker or another, tracking the advance and retreat of different voices as I walked. I found myself looking down much of the time, and walking slowly, like a man who has dropped a coin or lost a beloved. </p> <p>We walk the walk; Nauman and his actors and collaborators talk the talk. They rant, they tell jokes, they tell us alarming things. They soothe us and jerk us out of ourselves. Performance artist Rinde Eckert sings \"Feed me eat me anthropology\" in a loop. His wiry voice seems to take an arc into space. Nauman's own voice insinuates, slithers and chews and rasps his way across the Turbine Hall at ear level. It's like being pestered on the street. </p> <p>Nauman starts yelling \"Think!\" over and over. The command slices down the stairwell from above the bridge, crashing in from afar. Once you stand on the bridge, the words effectively flatten you to the floor. I move away, crabwise, but the voice is so insistent that it drowns any possibility of independent thought, and circumscribes my movements. I think I'm acting, remembering Nauman's own pacing in his early videos, which I'm starting to mime from memory. I also suddenly recall the physical effect of Richard Serra's two massive steel blocks, which once sat in the long hall of the Duveen Gallery at Tate Britain, and how their sheer presence, their weight and mass seemed to affect people's movements, even at a distance. Words also have mass, a similar hidden weight. </p> <p>I first encountered Raw Materials early on a Sunday morning, during a sound check. The first visitors of the day seemed initially confused by the voices, the rising cacophony. Bewildered, many circled about and slowly became entranced, if not a bit scared, while a few hardier souls walked, oblivious, towards the shop or the lifts. When Raw Materials was switched off, everyone suddenly stopped. It was a great moment, a great image. Who says this is a sound piece? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> At Tate Modern, London SE1, until March 28. Details: 020-7887 8888.</p>",
  "\"Think! Think! Think! Think!\" pulses an insistent voice as you climb the stairs to the bridge traversing Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. <p>The last Unilever commission for that vast, cavernous space, Olafur Eliasson's Weather Project, had the effect of turning visitors into touchy-feely folk who just wanted to lie on the floor, hold hands and stare longingly at their own reflections in the ceiling-mounted mirrors. </p> <p>Bruce Nauman's new sound installation, Raw Materials, which opens today, presents a subtler and more intellectual challenge. And it is a good deal more sinister than Eliasson's indoor sunshine. </p> <p>There is no visual component to the work, no trick, no special effects wow factor. The Turbine Hall is completely empty and raw. Visitors pass through a series of audio recordings from speakers mounted in pairs opposite each other on the walls of the space. The recordings consist of texts used in previous video or sound works by Nauman, stripped of their original contexts and redeployed as material for this new work. </p> <p>As you walk down the ramp of the Turbine Hall and through the different bands of sound, the effect is not unlike tuning in and out of radio stations. The first recording, at the west end of the Turbine Hall, is a repeated \"Thank you, thank you\", a rather endearing softener before the somewhat traumatic onslaught of voices that follows, ranging in tone from melancholy, sinister, abusive and bossy, to poetic, tender, cajoling and deadpan. </p> <p>Some of the texts are sung, some are obsessive repetitions of a single word or phrase. Some make no sense, or are bleakly absurd. All the while in the background moans a deep wordless sound, a white noise that pervades the whole of the Turbine Hall. </p> <p>Talking about the work, the New Mexico-based Nauman, 62, explained: \"The recordings are a sort of abstract material. They are not arranged in the space by content, but by intensity and rhythm - there is a rhythmic connection between them.\" </p> <p>The sound is deployed not unlike a sculptural material. But the work also has something in common with a musical composition, the visitor controlling to an extent which components are heard and when, depending on how they choose to move through the space. </p> <p>It transpires that the hordes of occasionally unruly schoolchildren who regularly congregate in the Turbine Hall had inspired the artist. \"There are a lot of kids who come in and make a lot of noise,\" he said. \"That contributed to the idea of using the space.\" </p> <p>He had also been intrigued by the Turbine Hall's curious \"background hum\", which comes from the still-working substation in the complex. How long would visitors be able to take these strange, insistent voices before going crazy? </p> <p>Nauman seemed unsure. \"I can seldom stand to be around my work for that long,\" he said. </p> <p><b> Art of words</b><br> </p> <p> \"Thank you thank you thank you thank you ...\" </p> <p>\"Think think think think think ...\" </p> <p>\"You may not want to be here.\" </p> <p>\"OK OK OK OK OK OK...\" </p> <p>\"It was a dark and stormy night. Three men were sitting around a campfire, One of the men said, 'Tell us a story Jack.' And Jack said, 'It was a dark and stormy night. Three men were sitting around a campfire. One of the men said, 'Tell us a story, Jack'... \" </p> <p>\"Work work work work work ...\" </p> <p>\"Live and Die, Die and Die, Shit and Die, Piss and Die...Fail and Live, Smile and Live, Think and Live, Pay and Live ...\" </p> <p>\"I'm having fun, you're having fun, we are having fun. This is fun. I'm bored, you're bored, we're bored, life is boring. I'm boring, you're boring, we're boring, this is boring.\" </p> <p>\"Get out of my mind, get out of this room.\" </p> <p>\"His precision and acuity left small cuts on the tips of my fingers or across the backs of my hands without any need to sit or otherwise withdraw.\" </p> <p>\"Feed me, eat me, anthropology ... help me, hurt me, sociology ... feed me, help me, eat me, hurt me.\"</p>",
  "Tony Blair's announcement on his future, looking to a time when he gives up the top job, seemed to stray from the policy issues. And his half-hearted attempt at an apology for Iraq leaves just as many questions unanswered as before. Exactly when did he agree with George Bush to go to war? The reasons he gave are being demolished, one by one, so what really persuaded him to follow Bush? I would think much more of him if he had given an apology to the nation: no one in life ever gets everything right. Where was the plan that leads to a conclusion of this war? <p>Secondly, the media's obsession with the relationship between Blair and Brown seems to dominate to an extent that I find it difficult to see through to what the policies really are. The fact that there is a low level of inflation is to commend Brown's policies and one always needs the dynamic of robust discussion! Labour's policies seem to be more of the same. I am sorry that the proposal to renationalise the railways got defeated, that would have been a plus for me.</p> <p>Moving on to the Conservative conference, Michael Howard gave a good speech obviously seeking to reassure the party that he does stand a chance of winning an election. Yet one contradiction stood out for me. He spoke of how his family had fled to Britain to escape Nazism and how he wants to give something back - and yet he wants to control to immigration to an even greater extent. Would his family have been allowed in now? </p> <p>Yet the policies he set out are really only a rehash of earlier ones. For me, his policies for the first month in office just pandered to the extreme right and the rightwing tabloids. To my mind, the continuing talk about crime just increases peoples fears of it. I recognise that there are areas where it is a serious matter but perhaps not across the whole country. And if \"prison works\" why is there an alleged increase in crime. Similarly the discipline problem in a few schools is not solved by giving teachers greater powers of expulsion. The Tories' instigation of league tables for schools - and all that has gone on since with claims of choice for parents - has not helped. </p> <p>It was interesting to note that no firm commitments were given about reducing taxes, because to maintain services needs cash, and income tax is still the fairest way. The continuing anti-European attitudes are discouraging, so they are saying nothing that would get my vote.</p> <p>As yet, I remain \"floating\".</p>",
  "At least 11 al-Qaida suspects have \"disappeared\" in US custody, and some may have been tortured, according to a report out today from Human Rights Watch. <p>The prisoners are being held without access to their families, lawyers or even the Red Cross. They are probably being held outside the US, the report said. In some cases, US authorities will not even acknowledge the prisoners are in custody.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch asserted that international treaties ratified by the US prohibit incommunicado detention of prisoners in secret locations. The Geneva Conventions require that the Red Cross has access to all detainees, after which it can notify families of their whereabouts. Under international human rights law, detainees must be held in recognised places of detention and be able to communicate with lawyers and family members. </p> <p>The report said the prisoners include the alleged architect of the September 11 attacks, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, captured by Pakistani authorities and extradited to the US last year. He is reported to have been tortured in custody, the group said.</p> <p>Abu Zubaydah, believed to be a close aide to Osama bin Laden, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who may have become one of the 9/11 hijackers if he had been successful in obtaining a US visa, and Hambali, an alleged key al-Qaida ally in southeast Asia, are among the other so-called 'ghost' detainees. </p> <p>In refusing to disclose the prisoners' whereabouts or acknowledge the detentions, Human Rights Watch said the US government has violated international law, international treaties and the Geneva Convention. The group called on the government to bring all its prisoners \"under the protection of the law\". </p> <p>\"Those guilty of serious crimes must be brought to justice before fair trials,\" said Reed Brody, special counsel with Human Rights Watch. \"If the United States embraces the torture and 'disappearance' of its opponents, it abandons its ideals and international obligations and becomes a lesser nation.\" </p> <p>CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said the agency has not seen the report and declined to comment. </p> <p>The Human Rights Watch report, titled \"The United States' 'Disappeared:' The CIA's Long-term 'Ghost Detainees\"', said many of the prisoners have provided valuable intelligence to US officials. But it also cited reports that some detainees have lied under pressure to please their interrogators.</p> <p>\"Human Rights Watch recognises, of course, the importance of effectively and rapidly gathering intelligence in order to trace the al-Qaida and other networks, capture other terrorists, and intervene to prevent more catastrophic terror attacks. However, the use of forced disappearances and secret incommunicado detention violates the most basic principles of a free society,\" the report reads.</p> <p>Aside from the human and civil rights considerations, the secret detentions could see other suspected terrorists walk free as courts demand access to testimony from US-held terror suspects. Prosecutors in Germany have been frustrated since they saw the 15-year sentence they won against suspected 9/11 plotter Mounir el Motassadeq overturned because they had no access to testimony from Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. A German appeals court ruled in March that his first trial was unfair because the US-held witnesses did not testify.</p> <p>Mr Motassadeq, still the only person to be convicted in relation to the September 11 attacks, is now being retried, but without access to the 'ghost' detainees, prosecutors fear he will be released. </p> <p>The lack of testimonies from the US-held al-Qaida suspects also played a large part in the acquittal, at the same court in February, of Mr Motassadeq's fellow Moroccan Abdelghani Mzoudi, who had faced identical charges. </p> <p>Human Rights Watch has no firsthand knowledge of the treatment of these detainees. Much of the report stems from news accounts that have cited unidentified government sources acknowledging the torture or mistreatment of detainees.</p>",

  "Was there really any difference between the Labour and Tory conferences? British politics seems to be becoming a shade of lilac, with each party promising similar enticing policies which there will never be enough money to deliver. <p> Aside from my cynicism, I think I preferred Tony Blair and the Labour party. However, I was disappointed to hear them say that they were committed to delivering the policies on which they won the first of their terms - and we are still waiting. Namely, law and order and making the streets safer by providing more police and enforcing antisocial behaviour orders. When? </p> <p> </p> <p>They proudly say that unemployment figures have gone down, but is that because people are no longer regarded as unemployed if they are \"Job Seekers\"? We have just heard that a local factory, Birds Eye, is to close with the loss of over 600 jobs. You would not think that Grimsby had a Labour MP - Austin Mitchell has done very little for the industry of this town. His first betrayal to my mind was to the fishing industry. Tony Crosland was far and away a better MP than he will ever be. </p> <p> </p> <p>I really feel that every party comes to power full of a genuine desire to improve the lot of the British people. They see areas where improvements can be made and try to implement them. However, reality sets in and the politicians realise that the promises they made are impossible to keep. Like a parent wanting to win favour with a child, promises can be made in an effort to appease - but the salary stays the same and the costs to come out of it keep rising. The promises then have to be broken. </p> <p> </p> <p>I saw nothing wrong with Tony Blair promising to stay on for a full third term if Labour wins the next election. If he had said nothing he would have been criticised for keeping everyone guessing and because he did, he is still wrong! </p> <p> </p> <p>As for the Conservative conference, I grudgingly admit that Michael Howard came over well, but I still don't think he is the right person to lead the party. I wish there was a younger man or woman capable of or suitable for the leadership. I think the policies they are unveiling are unworkable - where will the money come from? In any case, they will never win my vote because they are committed to keeping the pound and I want a party that will give us the euro. </p> <p>I think the Conservatives have lost their way and are too far gone to get back on track, certainly within my lifetime. The two main parties in contention now are, in my opinion, the Lib Dems and the Labour party. My decision as to where to cast my vote at the next election has also been narrowed down to these two.</p> <p> </p> <p>I personally see nothing wrong in paying higher income tax, if this would provide better benefits. Other countries, particularly in Scandinavia, have a far higher rate of tax than the UK and enjoy enhanced benefits. However, politicians in this country, in particular the Tories, seem to think that a bringing down tax is a votewinner. Fine, but at what cost? I would, however, bitterly resent more money being given away to benefit claimants who were not genuine. Many of these people are perfectly capable of working, but get more money from claiming benefits. I want to see a party who is brave enough to stamp down on this waste of money and I would give them my vote (if I liked their other policies!).</p>",
  "<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> We are going to build on the progress that we have made over the past seven years to really get to grips with homelessness and poverty. I'm proud of the work we've done so far. We've cut rough sleeping by 72% and more than doubled the amount we spend on affordable housing compared with 1997. We've strengthened the law to provide more protection for vulnerable homeless people and ended the scandal of homeless families forced to live for unnacceptably long periods in B&amp;B hotels, with no room for their children to work, play and grow.</p> <p>While we have improved the situation for many thousands of people, young and old, there is still widespread inequality and that is clearly unacceptable. Decades ago, I think we ignored the problems of poverty and homelessness; today we are doing something about it.</p> <p>This really hit home the other day when I watched Cathy Come Home again for the first time in years. The film isn't just a masterpiece, it reminded me of how life was in the 60s and how shocking Cathy's story was. It showed the terrible consequences of living in a society where there was little support and no choice.</p> <p>For those who haven't seen it, Cathy got married and wanted to start a family and a nice home of her own. Things went wrong when her child arrived. The kid wasn't welcome. She put herself on the waiting list, but it didn't make any difference. She was then forced into short-term, emergency accommodation, where she had to separate from her husband. </p> <p>He went off looking for work and she was left on her own. In desperation, she ended up with her child in a caravan, but that wasn't safe. The caravan was set on fire. The last scene was heartbreaking when she was left to sleep on the street and in the railway station. Her child was taken away from her - she was homeless and alone.</p> <p>One day I want to be able to say that no young person in Britain is disadvantaged by their personal circumstances. We will give people the chance to live in a decent home, in a healthy and safe environment, with a solid education and secure employment. As I said, we have improved the situation for millions, but there's still a long way to go.</p> <p><strong>Centrepoint</strong>: Last month, the prime minister declared that the government's crusade against social exclusion was working, but his claim coincided with new figures that showed homelessness had reached a new record high. How do you square that circle?</p> <p><strong>Prescott</strong>: The important thing for us was to strengthen the law to give more vulnerable people - in particular young people - protection and accommodation and to bring them in to the welfare system. This contributes to a short-term statistical increase in homelessness. Of course, that creates good headlines for the papers and I have to live with that. </p> <p>For me, getting more help to more people is the most important thing - it shows that we are really making a difference. Having put the safety net into place, I expect the level of homelessness and use of temporary accommodation to fall over the next three years as our policies on prevention and housing start to take effect.</p> <p>I think that our approach to tackling inequality across the board is the right way. Investing in health, education, housing and employment is helping to tackle poverty for everyone. The challenge now is to get that support to the most disadvantaged. We already have 700,000 fewer kids in poverty and 1.85 million more people in work. We've also cut the number of non-decent homes by 1 million since 1997. No one can say for certain where we'll be in 10 years, but I'm convinced that we're making the right investments today.</p> <p><strong>Centrepoint</strong>: The government has a clear priority to reach the families most in need, but what action are you taking to reach those young people who have been thrown out of their family home?</p> <p><strong>Prescott</strong>: By addressing the needs of families today, we are helping to solve the problems that young people will face tomorrow. We have taken special action to tackle homelessness among young people too. We amended the law to give housing priority to homeless 16- and 17-year-olds and young people leaving care. I'm also pleased that an independent evaluation of local authorities, due to be published later this year, has found that virtually all of their homelessness strategies make special mention of young people's needs.</p> <p>More than 85% have considered special proposals to help 16- and 17-year-olds, including targeted advice and support, specialist accommodation - like foyers - and family mediation. Like I said earlier, tackling the underlying inequalities, the underlying causes, is the most important thing. Of course, things do go wrong and a Labour government will be there to catch people when they fall.</p> <p><strong>Centrepoint</strong>: How can you tackle the problems of young homeless people effectively if you do not know how many there are, or where they're living?</p> <p><strong>Prescott</strong>: We already know a great deal about homelessness and we learn more every year from improved data. Next year, for example, we will be carrying out a major survey of homeless households, including 16- and 17-year-olds.</p> <p>The attempt by York University and Centrepoint to quantify the number of homeless young people is welcome, but I'm not sure about using figures from Scotland and applying them to England.</p> <p>I think the best way to understand the problem is to look at it at a regional and local level - that's where the problems are and where the services are delivered. The Homelessness Act is helping by identifying and dealing with homelessness through local reviews and strategies. </p> <p><strong>Centrepoint</strong>: Having expressed concern at the large number of housing associations, do you think there are too many homelessness charities?</p> <p><strong>Prescott</strong>: For a start, these charities are often focused on local areas and needs and they work collaboratively with others, like Centrepoint. In my view, coordination is essential to success, regardless of the number of organisations involved. The Homelessness Act is helping local authorities to develop even stronger partnerships with the voluntary sector, and I want to see this continue.</p>",

  "<p>Centrepoint was established 35 years ago as emergency shelter for homeless young people in London's West End. A few months later, and some 200 miles north, a young John Prescott was elected MP for Kingston-upon-Hull. </p> <p>Since then, the charity has grown, and now has a national reputation in policymaking and campaigns for homeless young people.</p> <p>Today deputy prime minister Prescott is responsible for housing and tackling homelessness. He's the first to admit there is still much to be done, but he can point to much progress in the past seven years. </p> <p>Housing, homelessness and social exclusion has not always been at the top of the political agenda. It wasn't until 1977, under Jim Callaghan's Labour government, that local housing authorities were given a duty to help homeless people. Families with children, single people made homeless through an emergency, and vulnerable groups were given priority by housing departments.</p> <p>Twenty years later, the then Conservative government introduced legislation so that councils had a duty only to accommodate homeless people for two years. In addition, homeless people were removed from the list of groups given preference for social housing. This was reversed when Labour returned to power in 1997 with social exclusion high on its reform agenda. Labour restored preference for homeless households for social housing and launched a capital receipts initiative to boost investment in housing, which had been halved between 1992 and 1997.</p> <p>It took a further five years and a second term of office before Labour introduced the 2002 Homelessness Act. Councils must now secure long-term accommodation for homeless households.</p> <p>They are required to compile a five-year strategy for preventing and tackling homelessness in their area, while regulations have extended the groups judged to be in priority need - now including young people leaving care and 16- and 17-year-olds.</p> <p>The act also made it compulsory for councils to conduct a review of all forms of homelessness to inform their strategies. Alongside this stronger legislation, Labour set a target to end the longterm use of B&amp;B hotels for homeless families with children, and set up a directorate to help develop new, preventive approaches. </p> <p>In his keynote speech to the Labour party conference this year, Prescott said that Britain's housing crisis would be one of his party's general election priorities. And a recent report from the government's Social Exclusion Unit identified homelessness as one of the \"remaining\" challenges that Labour intends to address. It said: \"We need to give renewed attention to these areas as a matter of priority.\"</p> <p>This special supplement is intended to take stock of youth homelessness in the context of the wider battle against social exclusion. We begin by asking Prescott himself how he sees the picture and what he proposes to do.</p>",
  "<p>If you want to retire at 65 with the equivalent of the average salary - a bit less than \u00a325,000, say - then you had better be saving hard. </p> <p>According to the financial advice firm Chase de Vere, you will need to have a pension pot of more than \u00a3330,000. If you are starting to save in your 30s, that means you need to set aside about \u00a3240 each month for your retirement. </p> <p>If you've left it until you are 40 to start saving for the future, then prepare to tighten your belt - you should be saving \u00a3490 each month. And if you have reached 50, then you had better cancel all social engagements and move in with friends, as you need to be saving more than \u00a31,150 each month. </p> <p>If today's Pensions Commission report hammers home one point it is that the state cannot afford to pay for our retirement and, as things currently stand, neither can we. According to the report, more than 12 million people over the age of 25 are not saving enough for their retirement and more than two-thirds of those are saving nothing. </p> <p>The trouble, as Des Hamilton, technical director at the Pensions Advisory Service (Opas), puts it is: \"If you are not saving up for your retirement, no one else is going to do it for you.\" </p> <p>First, there is not enough money in the state coffers to go round. According to the report, to maintain current levels of income would mean finding an extra \u00a357bn a year - not the sort of sum that can be rescued from down the back of the sofa.</p> <p>The commission's report does not lay out likely policy changes - that will happen in a follow-up, to be published next year - but it does starkly spell out the facts: we will have to face up to a combination of working longer and saving harder, and we might have to deal with steeper taxes to boot. </p> <p>The pensions industry is hoping that this report will not only kick the government into touch over pensions but will also get people thinking seriously about providing for their retirement. </p> <p>\"The earlier you start, the easier it will be,\" says Adrian Boulding, pensions strategy director at Legal &amp; General. According to something he gleefully calls Boulding's Law, to work out the percentage of your salary you need to save to give yourself a comfortable retirement, you take your age and halve it. So if you are 20, then you should save 10% for your entire working life; if you're starting at 30, you need to set aside 15%; at 40, you save 20%; and so on. The later you leave it, the bigger and more painful the chunk. </p> <p>But where to save it? Mr Boulding urges: \"If your company runs a pensions scheme, then join it. And if you are already a member, then you should review the amount you are paying in. A lot of these schemes allow you to start contributions at a very low level, and you are probably not saving enough.\" </p> <p>The commission's report backs him up. It says that among members of defined contributions schemes, which guarantee the level of contributions made to the fund but not the size of the pension pot at the end, at least 75% are paying in too little to have a decent pension at the end. </p> <p>But while company schemes are also the most straightforward way to save, they are not the only option. There are plenty of other choices, and it is a good idea to discuss your situation with an independent financial adviser. </p> <p>If we continue to save too little too late, then saving up for retirement may no longer be an option; it could be an obligation. Julian Crooks, a Sheffield-based financial adviser, is in favour of making compulsory both individuals' and employers' contributions to pensions. \"Politicians don't like the word compulsion because they think people will see it as another tax, but we might as well admit we need it,\" he says. </p> <p>It is not a popular option with everyone. The CBI, for one, is adamant that compelling employers to contribute to employees' pensions schemes would be a terrible idea. </p> <p>And Legal &amp; General's Mr Boulding feels it might be a dangerous idea to force individuals to pay into a pension. \"There are stages in life when there are other things pulling on the purse strings and pensions come further down the list of priorities,\" he says. To force people to pay into a scheme might mean too severe a squeeze on finances at times.</p> <p>The message in the Pension Commission's report it scarily clear: there is no easy way out of the looming pensions crisis. Something has got to give.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's James Hickman has become the first swimmer to win consecutive gold medals at five World Short Course Championships.</p> <p>The Manchester athlete has dominated the men's 200m butterfly event over the past seven years with golds in 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2002 and has now added 2004 to his list of honours.</p> <p>\"I'm bouncing right now but number five was the most nerve-wracking race of my whole career. I think the more you win, the more the pressure mounts,\" said Hickman. \"The first one is easy in comparison because you're the hunter and not the hunted. It's better to chase than to be chased.\"</p> <p>\"There was a lot of pressure and weight on my shoulders which has been lifted. I think overall I did pretty well.\"</p> <p>Though victory in Indianapolis sees him achieve an unprecedented feat, the 28-year-old is under no illusion that his task would have been more difficult if it had not been for the withdrawal of his main rival, the American Michael Phelps.</p> <p>However, rather than take comfort from Phelps' absence, Hickman was left slightly disappointed not to have faced the Olympic champion.</p> <p>\"I know Michael (Phelps) wasn't here but it would have been a good race if he had been. I was always here to try to take control of that event but it's just a shame we couldn't race each other.\"</p> <p>Hickman still had the rest of the field to beat and he did so in a time of 1.53.41, ahead of Romanian Ioan Gherghel in 1.54.06 and Peng Wu of China in 1.54.51.</p> <p>\"The last 25m was hard, my arms felt like lead and I felt like I had no strength left. There was no one around me though and maybe if there was it would have been a faster time.\"</p> <p>Despite his victory, a delighted Hickman, who competed at the Olympics in 1996, 2000 and in Athens this year, also announced his plans to retire even before he had collected his medal. </p> <p>\"I enjoy what I do. It can be the best feeling in the world. All those people watching and cheering you on, it's just fantastic, but I will be retiring at the end of this year because I want to stop while I'm at the top,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It's been a great year, I've got the European Short Course Championships in Vienna to go and then I'll call it a day hopefully after one more good performance.\" </p> <p>Britain's small squad of five concluded their championships with five medals in total.</p>",

  "<p>The government's drive to teach more disabled pupils in mainstream schools is failing, despite the fact that teachers think more inclusive education is a good idea, the schools watchdog said today. </p> <p>In the first major report since the government strengthened the rights of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to go to mainstream instead of special schools, Ofsted found that the proportion of SEN pupils in mainstream schools had remained static. </p> <p>The Ofsted inspectors reported that despite having a better attitude to inclusive education, most schools had not improved their provision. </p> <p>The chief inspector of Ofsted, David Bell, said: \"The report paints a varied picture of success so far. Most schools have been convinced of the benefits of inclusion. However, against common perceptions, the proportion of pupils with statements of SEN in mainstream schools has not yet been affected by the inclusion framework.\"</p> <p>The report, Special educational needs and disability: towards inclusive schools, found that although more schools wanted to be seen as inclusive and regarded it as a positive thing, their provision for SEN pupils was no broader than it was before the government legislation. </p> <p>SEN pupils are those with any condition that might affect their learning. They might be dyslexic, have attention disorders or physical disabilities, which mean they are wheelchair users. </p> <p>However, it is pupils who have behavioural and social problems that bring the biggest challenges. Headteachers struggled to reconcile the rights of the individual child with that of the whole school or class, which they feared would suffer if appropriate attention was not given to the child, the report said.</p> <p>Local authorities were also failing to foster links between mainstream and special schools to create more integration. </p> <p>Mr Bell added: \"Continued efforts are called for to ensure that more mainstream schools have the capacity and staff are confident about admitting and supporting pupils with more complex needs, especially those with social and behavioural difficulties.</p> <p>\"Until more is expected from the lowest-attaining pupils, improvement in provision for pupils with SEN and in the standards they reach will be slow.\"</p> <p>As Ofsted published its report, the woman who pioneered the drive towards more inclusive teaching called for a major rethink of SEN policy. Mary Warnock, who authored a report on special education 25 years ago that first challenged the norm of SEN pupils being educated separately, argued that although SEN pupils were taught in mainstream schools, they were often taught apart from other pupils, and without proper provision could become victims of bullying. </p> <p>Writing in the magazine of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers union, Ms Warnock said: \"Such children will not, in any case, be well served if they are taught mainly by classroom assistants, or are removed into units isolated from their contemporaries. And they are likely to encounter bullying.\"</p>",
  "<p>Following last week's Online article on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/online/story/0,3605,1320832,00.html\">rise of anonymous workplace bloggers</a>, this is the second of our full interviews with the people who spill the beans on their chosen profession. Yesterday we printed a Q&amp;A with the writer of <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/online/archives/weblogging/2004/10/whats_in_a_name.html\">Call Centre Confidential</a>.</p> <p>This time around it's Dr Dre, who blogs about working for a major fast food retailer at <a href=\"http://anytownNHStrust.blogspot.com\">Doing Less Harm</a>.</p> <p><strong>Online:</strong> When did you start your blog and why? Were other blogs, in particular other job/workplace blogs, an inspiration?</p> <p><strong>Dr Dre:</strong> I've been blogging for about three months now, but I've been toying with the idea for much longer. Whenever my colleagues and I had lunch, we would swap funny stories of things that had happened. Someone once said to me that mine were always the funniest and that I had a knack for storytelling. It was then that I started to think maybe I should share these stories.</p> <p>I never really read many blogs up until about a year ago when your blog awards introduced me to Call Centre Confidential. I've been reading that ever since and it was a case of, if Wrapstar can do this, so can I. From a writing point of view, Charlie Brooker's Screen Burn in the Guide makes me cry with laughter every week. If I could write half as well as him and get half the laughs then I would be satisfied</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> What were you initially hoping to achieve with the blog? Has your blog (and what you write on it) changed as it's gone on?</p> <p><strong>D:</strong> I didn't really have any aims when I set out other than to make people laugh. Because it's only three months old, there hasn't been much of a change, although I have become a better writer.</p> <p>I suppose at the start I was always looking for stories which had a huge significance to the Trust and that people would be able to relate to. But more recently, I have become focused on the tiny details of my office environment. Like answering the phone, the canteen toast run and ordering the water cooler water.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> What's reaction to it been like so far? Which kinds of entries are the most popular/draw the most comment?</p> <p><strong>D:</strong> The reaction has been OK, all of the people I have had contact with have said how much they enjoy the blog - example comment \"Your blog made me howl\". The most popular entry I have written was about the star rating system and some of the problems our Trust faces. We are in a unique situation where we need money to invest in one area to get our stars while the PCT needs us to invest in another area so they can get their stars. I also seem to get a good reaction on posts which focus around meetings and my observations on them. I suppose this is because these are universal to any work place and the same stupid things happen everywhere.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> You blog anonymously - if you blogged under your real name, how would your blog be different?</p> <p><strong>D:</strong> It certainly would be very different. Without this veil of anonymity, I don't think I would tell half the stories I do. Or at least I would have to edit them to the point where they become unfunny. It would become more about me and what I am experiencing rather than the Trust as a whole and the characters in my team. Or more likely, without anonymity, it wouldn't exist.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Does anyone from your work read your blog? If so, has anyone guessed that you're behind the blog?</p> <p><strong>D:</strong> I don't think anyone at my work reads my blog, which is probably a good thing. In a very quiet week, I wrote a story about something that had happened in my previous job. One of the comments I got was from a former colleague, who left their work email address. What they didn't realise was that the person I was blogging about was sitting in an office on the floor above them and that was probably a good thing.</p> <p>I often wonder what people's reactions would be if they found it. I think and hope the individuals involved will see it for what it is - a joke. Although I'm not sure what the organisation would think. This is the issue that keeps most work bloggers awake at night.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Do you see your blog as a purely personal thing - a way of dealing with the everyday frustrations at work - or does it have a more general, possibly political purpose - a kind of low-level whistle-blowing function - letting people know the reality of certain modern jobs?</p> <p><strong>D:</strong> I really didn't start my blog for any other reason other than to make people laugh. If in that process, I can make some statements about the modern workplace or some quasi-political posts about the NHS, then that is purely a side issue. I would like to think that my blog and the stories I tell would be just as suited to any office environment. I happen to write about the NHS because I work in it. If I worked in a consultancy firm, then I'm sure I would be able to tell similar stories.</p> <p>I suppose in some way my blog does whistle blow but not on the NHS so much, more on the office environment in general and what it is like to work in the 21st century.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Some people have suggested workplace blogs are a kind of rebellion against modern 'overwork' culture (in which people work longer and longer hours, in which work is seen as some sort of defining moral value, in which workers are under more and more surveillance and control, via audits, reviews etc). Do you agree?</p> <p><strong>D:</strong> Working in the NHS, I think it will probably take a few years before we catch on to some of these ideas about more control and audits and reviews ;) I think the majority of work blogs are more of a rebellion against the stupid initiatives that people come up with. Rather than the overwork culture it's more of a rebellion against idiocy. Why spend thousands of pounds on getting a new logo when there are wards where 8 nurses have to share one PC, which is locked in the sister's office.</p> <p>I always think of Dilbert when I'm writing mine.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Why do you think people read your blog? To find out 'the inside truth' about a particular area of modern life?</p> <p><strong>D:</strong> I would hope first and foremost that people read my blog to be entertained. If they are coming for a cheap laugh, I hope they get it. If they are coming to know more about the NHS, then I hope they find that too.</p> <p>I blame 'Driving School' and 'Sylvanian Waters'. Both shows are responsible for the current swathe of 'reality' TV. It seems an inherent part of today's popular culture that people want to look over the fence and into your living room to see if the grass is greener or if you have grass! I'm sure at some level there is some snooping going on but I hope my readers don't expect an insightful and intelligent deconstruction of the modern NHS workplace because they won't get that from me. All they will get is 15 or so lines of text setting them up for a punchline.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Is what you write on your blog 'the truth' about your job? Or do you sometimes find yourself embellishing slightly, to make the blog more interesting. Bloggers often say that, though they set out to write about the everyday reality of their lives, they find that they've created a kind of alternate persona, which both is them and isn't, at the same time. Perhaps another way of coming at this is to say that blogs can be like stories and, as you build up momentum/audience, is there a temptation to spice things up slightly to keep people hooked?</p> <p><strong>D:</strong> Hmmm, I often joke with the one person who knows about me and the blog that it is probably 95% truthful. There are two major twists I put in as the vast majority of posts don't happen as they are written. They are either a mish-mash of things that have happened to me in this job and some from my previous jobs or the actual action finishes before the punch line and I embellish slightly to get the story to a funnier conclusion.</p> <p>For instance, in one of my recent posts the Consultant I spoke to did not say \"Do you not know who I am?\" but I couldn't finish on the joke I wanted to, unless I added that line. I have yet to manipulate a workplace situation into something that could be bloggable but on a quiet week soon, I know I won't be able to resist.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Why are anonymous job blogs so popular now? Does it say something about modern work? Or does it say something about blogs and what people think they 're best at (e.g. personal accounts that take you inside a previously hidden world/correct big media assumptions etc)?</p> <p><strong>D:</strong> I think I answered this one a couple of questions ago. The need for and love of 'reality' TV has meant that people have become more inquisitive and want to look into hidden worlds. I will never get to work in a call centre but thanks to Call Centre Confidential I now know that it really is just like any other office but instead of focusing on fixing people, like the NHS, its about selling stuff.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> What do you hope to achieve with your blog? A way out of your current job? A publishing deal?</p> <p><strong>D:</strong> I really don't aim to achieve anything. I love my current job and wouldn't swap it for any other job. My main aim is to keep it funny and keep it light hearted. There are too many blogs that are written by someone in their mid 20s and all they do is spout some 'Dawson's Creek' /'Bridget Jones' style teen angst. What I want to show is that blogging doesn't necessarily have to be about that and that it can be a fun thing.</p> <p>I have really never considered a publishing deal and I don't think I would want one. I am a public sector IT worker and will be for life, I enjoy that and don't see any reason why I would want to change that. Anyway, if I did get offered one, my old English teacher would probably have a heart attack. It was never my strongest subject.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Is doing your blog still fun? Do you foresee a time when it might feel like another (unpaid) job? If that happened, what would you do?</p> <p><strong>D:</strong> Blogging is still fun but it is stressful. Keeping my ears open for small tit-bits of information which would make an amusing post can be time consuming and distracting. For someone who has never been a good writer, like me, finalising the post before publishing is one of the hardest things. Checking over the flow of the sentences and making sure the language is as tight as possible. All this does take some of the fun out of blogging. I'm quite sure that my blog has a finite life span. I just hope I realise when it's the right moment to call time on it. I hope that when it does become a chore or when I become unfunny or start using the same jokes over and over again, or just steal them from 'The Simpsons', that I am gracious enough to walk away and leave my blog.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Do you feel a sense of responsibility to your readers? By which I mean I think a lot of people read job/workplace blogs and trust that they're telling it like it is about a particular job... Which is another way of saying - do you see yourself as a kind of journalist, with certain responsibilities as a result, or does the blog only have to please you/work for you?</p> <p><strong>D:</strong> I really don't feel too much responsibility to be truthful to my readers. I think the vast majority of them can identify that my blog is not 100% accurate because some of the things that happen are just too outrageous to be true. I look at it as the equivalent of watching 'Casualty' or 'Green Wing'. Watch 'Casualty' if you want the real hospital experience but if you want to see some real-ish people (all be it with the volume turned up) put into amusing situations, watch Green Wing.</p> <p>I don't really feel any journalistic integrity. As Wrapstar of Call Centre Confidential once put it, if you get a choice between printing the legend or the truth - print whichever is funnier. All the blog really has to do is make people laugh. I don't think I need to be totally truthful. Maybe if someone reads one of my posts then they may be misled into thinking that the entire health service is like that, but if they stick around and read more - I hope they will realise that I use a certain amount of artistic licence.</p> <p>I am not a journalist, I am more of a chilled out entertainer. Now where have I heard that phrase before? ;)</p> <p><em>Interview by Jim McClellan</em></p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>FUTURE SHOCKER</b></p> <p>Is this the dullest Independent front page ever? Don't take my word for it. Stop at a newsagent on the way home and take a quick look, because the Wrap suspects there will be plenty of copies left unsold. The paper has collected 19 statistics and arranged them carefully under the headline: \"THE PENSIONS CRISIS (Or everything you need to know about your future but may be too scared to ask).\"</p> <p>Who could blame the casual reader for preferring the Mail, which splashes with the news that animal rights extremists have stolen a woman's body from a churchyard in Staffordshire? \"INHUMAN: Animal activists stole this woman's body from a grave. Now her family fear they plan to return it a piece at a time.\" Or the Express's revelation that Britons will be rationed to six credit cards each? (\"And that includes store cards,\" adds the paper, resentfully.)</p> <p>The Guardian, meanwhile, splashes with worries of a \"black hole\" in NHS funding. The cost of a new computer system, which will allow patients to book their own hospital appointments and medical staff to access records quickly, may be as high as GBP30bn - five times as much as originally thought. Health trusts may have to divert money from patient care to pay for the system, the paper says.</p> <p>Mr Blair's announcement of his third-term vision, in which the computerised NHS will probably play a part, leaves those papers that bother to mention it underwhelmed. \"Complicated, slightly bossy and not very believable,\" complains the Telegraph. \"Groundhogwash Day,\" mocks the Sun: \"Any similarities between yesterday's announcement and Mr Blair's previous undelivered visions for Britain are entirely coincidental. Probably.\"</p> <p>\"Labour is addressing 'big' issues, as opposed to the minimalism of the Tories,\" writes Peter Riddell in the Times. \"This ties in with Mr Blair's instincts now. He is in a 'Prometheus unbound' phase, impatient, aware of time running out and determined to leave his mark ... Incremental change in schools, health and the like has 'improved things but not transformed them' ... Mr Blair's aim is 'to put middle class aspirations in the hands of working class families'. The implications are controversial. How far should invalidity benefit claimants be forced into work? How far should workers be compelled to save for retirement?\"</p> <p>The PM's ideas, says the Independent, are \"half-baked\": \"The prime minister should concentrate on keeping his existing promises, rather than making new ones.\" Readers who want a preview of Adair Turner's report on the state of Britain's pension provision should turn to the FT.</p> <p>\"The report will warn that many individuals are being forced to take investment risks that they are poorly placed to handle as companies close final salary schemes and replace them with money purchase schemes into which neither employers nor employees are putting enough,\" the paper says. \"And it will challenge businesses to switch to career average pensions, with retirement age tied to life expectancy, rather than simply close defined benefit schemes completely, dumping all the risks on the individual.\"</p> <p>The Times and Telegraph cough up and chew over Tony Blair's troubles, with the former picking up a report saying the armed forces are \"demoralised\" by \"poor equipment and biased selection\". Only one in seven of the army, RAF, naval and Ministry of Defence staff questioned thought their budget was spent wisely.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/internet/story/0,8150,1325211,00.html\">NHS faces GBP15bn black hole</a><br> * <a href=\"http://money.independent.co.uk/personal_finance/pensions/story.jsp?story=571242\">Independent: The pensions crisis</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1301560,00.html\">Times: Forces rebel against MoD for wasting public money</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/911511be-1bc0-11d9-8af6-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: UK pensions alert on life expectancy forecasts</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004471918,00.html\">Sun: Blair: My vision for Britain</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,171-1305289,00.html\">Times: Peter Riddell</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/10/12/dl1201.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/10/12/ixportal.html\">Telegraph: It's welfare reform day</a></p> <p><b>SUPERMAN DIES</b></p> <p>The death of Christopher Reeve, the actor better known as Superman, shocks all the papers.

  "A rival counter-conference to this week's European Social Forum in London is being planned to protest at the \"hijacking\" of the anti-war, global justice event by mainstream organisations and individuals such as the trade unions and the mayor of London. <p>This week's ESF - the third annual meeting of leftwing and environmental activists from across Europe - is expected to attract around 20,000 people from across Europe for three days of debate. It will culminate in a demonstration on Sunday against the US President, George Bush, and the war in Iraq.</p> <p>But internal splits, between grassroots activists on one side and key players and major sponsors on the other, have now broken into the open, with a hardcore of anarchists and direct action supporters organising a more freeform, rival conference.</p> <p>While delegates, who pay a \u00a330 registration fee, will spend Thursday and Friday at the main conference venues of Alexandra Palace and Bloomsbury to debate war, racism and corporate power, the fringe festival - dubbed \"Beyond ESF\" - will celebrate \"self-organised cultures of resistance\".</p> <p>It's organisers, backed by the small London anarchists' outfit the Wombles, will meet away from the main conference site, at Middlesex University in Tottenham.</p> <p>Organisers say the purpose of the alternative conference is because the ESF has been \"hijacked by authoritarian organisations such as the SWP [Socialist Workers party] and racist, war-crazy corporate whores Neo Labour [who have] got in on the act through Ken Livingstone and the GLA\".</p> <p>A spokesman for the mayor rejected the accusation that the event had become \"corporate\", and added that: \"The ESF is being held by London, and the mayor is only 'hosting' a welcome reception.\"</p> <p>However, several of the mayor's team of advisors, including Lee Jaspar, attended the Paris ESF in November 2003 to lobby for the event to come to London.</p> <p>The Wombles state: \"Beyond ESF is radically different from the official ESF. No government sponsorship (GLA and mayor of London) and no political parties. There will be no 'leading activists', 'big-name speakers' or entrance fee.\"</p> <p>Workshops on ad-busting, shoplifting global brands, defence of the Roma people, opposition to the EU constitution and the history of squatting will be held, culminating in a day of discussion on resisting the forthcoming Gleneagles meeting of the G8 under UK stewardship.</p> <p>The four main themes are billed as \"Autonomy &amp; Struggle\", \"No Borders &amp; Migration\", \"Casualisation\", and \"Social Control &amp; Repression\". In addition there will be food, cinema and live musical entertainment each evening. </p> <p>Splits had already been apparent in the year-long build up to the conference. Ken Livingstone's team won the right to host the conference at last year's ESF in Paris, but since then rows have developed behind the scenes between the so-called \"horizontals\", or non-affiliated groups, and the \"verticals\", such as the trade unions, the GLA and the Socialist Workers party.</p> <p>The activists' news site Indymedia will be covering both the official ESF and the counter-conference. They will be broadcasting an hour-long daily show rounding up the ESF on Resonance 104.4 FM. Some 20,000 copies of an Autonomous Spaces free newspaper have also been published to persuade delegates to the official conference to attend some of the rival events.</p> <p>On the cultural side, the Rampart squatted art and social space in Whitechapel will be organising film shows, music and workshops, food, internet access, audio &amp; video editing and prop &amp; banner making as well as hosting the \"Mobile Carnival Forum\" - a double-decker bus making a daily spontaneous trip between venues, and the situationist art-guerrillas the \"Lab of Insurrectionary Imagination\" will also work out of the squat.</p> <p>The Guardian is a media partner of the ESF.</p> <p>Official ESF website: <a href=\"http://www.fse-esf.org/en/\">www.fse-esf.org/en/</a></p> <p>Beyond ESF agenda: <a href=\"http://wombles.org.uk/news/article_2004_10_8_5355.php\">wombles.org.uk/news/article_2004_10_8_5355.php</a></p> <p>Laboratory of Insurrection: <a href=\"http://www.labofii.net/home/\">www.labofii.net/home/</a></p>",
  "One of the most famous names in the history of northern education has been earmarked for closure, as part of a \"leaner and meaner\" drive by the University of Leeds. <p>New students at the rural Bretton Hall campus, which has an international reputation for the performing arts and design, were shocked to learn that the Palladian mansion has been recommended for closure before they finish their degrees. </p> <p>Current courses have been guaranteed under the plan but by 2006 they will be moved to Leeds itself, 15 miles up the M1 from the secluded valley near Wakefield, which 1,000 students share with the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. </p> <p>The proposal goes before the university's senate next month and the governing council in December. It would save an estimated \u00a32.6m a year - the annual loss on running costs. </p> <p>But it is already facing opposition from Bretton students, who have printed Save Bretton Hall T-shirts and draped parts of the 18th century mansion and outbuildings with protest banners. Well-known graduates, who include the playwrights John Godber and Kay Mellor, are offering support. Mellor, who made her name with TV series such as Band of Gold, said that losing Bretton Hall would be \"appalling\". </p> <p>Students have started informal talks about legal action because of the alleged lack of warning when this year's new intake applied for places. </p> <p>Bretton Hall was founded in 1949 by Sir Alec Clegg, chief education officer of the West Riding county council, as a higher education college which came to specialise in arts teaching and practice. It ran into financial problems after leaving local authority control, which were solved by a merger with Leeds University three years ago. </p> <p>The change saw textiles, fashion and graphics courses moved to the main city campus, and it soon became clear that the future of Bretton remained uncertain. The university said that the mixture of historic buildings and high-maintenance post-war classrooms and hostels was too heavy a burden to bear. </p> <p>Leeds has also signalled plans to slow its relentless expansion, which has caused major housing problems. </p> <p>Courses are being audited and no general guarantee has been given to all those run at Bretton once current students ave graduated. Most will be relocated in Leeds, however, where pro vice-chancellor Alan Pearman said facilities were better and bigger. </p> <p>He said: \"We appreciate the attractions of the Bretton site and the affection in which it is held. But our vision has to be world class, and to achieve that we need to integrate arts excellence at Leeds, where our students have the best facilities, the widest range of study opportunities, and ready access to one of Britain's cultural capitals.\" </p> <p>Closure of Bretton has implications for the sculpture park, which uses most of the surrounding 500 acres of woodland, fields and lakes. One of Britain's biggest collections of outdoor work by Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and other sculptors is on display in the hall's grounds, as well as at a visitor centre. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the park said the university's departure would not affect exhibitions and visitors, but it is unlikely the project would have use for the empty hall. </p> <p>Leeds also plans to close its Manygates campus in Wakefield and move 250 social work and continuing education students. They would use local colleges in the city or transfer to the main campus. </p> <p>Leeds student union spokesman Tom Wong said: \"We will be working with the university to make sure that all students are provided for.\"</p>",
  "<p>Interflora is to set up an independent committee to vet plans to change itself into a company, bringing in private equity group 3i as the majority shareholder. </p> <p>Interflora said yesterday it had agreed to enter exclusive talks with 3i and that an 11-member committee, chosen by secret ballot, will check the proposals are \"fair, honest and decent\". Previous plans to change Interflora's structure have run into opposition from members. </p> <p>Interflora said that it had chosen a link with 3i in preference to an offer to buy 100% of Interflora from \"a non-UK trade company\" - even though that bid valued Interflora at a 20% premium to the 3i terms. </p> <p>\"The board believed that it was highly unlikely that there would be sufficient support from the membership for a trade sale, despite the higher price,\" Interflora said in a statement. </p> <p>The 3i group is offering Interflora members a choice between a cash payment, retaining 35% of Interflora or a combination of cash and shares. </p> <p>Yesterday's decision follows almost a year-long debate about the future of Interflora as it battles against increasing competition from rivals, including UK supermarket chains.</p>",
  "<p>Hollinger International will pursue a multimillion dollar claim against its former chief, disgraced Tory peer Lord Black, after a US judge threw out an initial claim on a technicality.</p> <p>The New York-based firm said it would press on with a claim that Lord Black and other former directors looted the Daily Telegraph's former parent of $380m (\u00a3211m) through fraudulent payments, after a US judge dismissed its \u00a31.25bn suit against Black for racketeering.</p> <p>Judge Manning threw out the case on Friday on a technicality, saying it should be heard under American securities fraud law rather than the Racketeer Influenced &amp; Corrupt Organisations Act, or RICO, as Hollinger had hoped.</p> <p>The ruling means Hollinger International is left with little recourse but to pursue Lord Black for the initial $380m - plus $103.9m in interest - through a new case in the federal court.</p> <p>\"The court's dismissal of the special committee's claims on technical grounds does not in any way diminish the strength or merits of the breach of fiduciary duty claims that have been asserted against these defendants,\" said the Hollinger International interim chairman, Gordon Paris.</p> <p>\"In the interests of the company and its shareholders, the special committee will pursue these claims aggressively and seek restitution funds diverted by the defendants from the company.\"</p> <p>A spokesman confirmed the company had until Thursday to notify the court it was to appeal the initial ruling, but Hollinger may have to abandon the original claim of racketeering and proceed with a fraud action.</p> <p>Hollinger said it would continue to pursue Lord Black despite criticisms by some shareholders of its policy of concentrating solely on Lord Black, his wife and three other directors.</p> <p>Now into its second year, the case started when a committee of Hollinger directors accused Lord Black and others of helping themselves to $32m in fees without the knowledge or approval of other directors.</p> <p>That initial claim later ballooned to nearly $400m, accounting for nearly all the company's profits between 1997 and 2003.</p> <p>By August this year, Hollinger had amassed a 513-page dossier detailing the amounts Black, his wife Barbara Amiel and three others had allegedly taken out of the company accusing them of \"corporate kleptocracy\". </p> <p>Hollinger, which has until October 14 to reply to the court, is expected to announce that it is re-filing the case after Manning said the court had made no ruling on the legitimacy of the fraud claims.</p> <p>Lord Black, however, dismissed the claims, which come just weeks after he filed a counter-claim for libel against Hollinger International.</p> <p>\"We continue to believe that Hollinger International's entire suit is tabloid journalism masquerading as law,\" Lord Black said in a statement. </p> <p>\"If any of the claims are re-filed, we will look forward to exposing, in an appropriate legal forum, the falsehoods on which those claims are based.\" </p> <p>He has always denied wrongdoing and is suing at least one publication for libel. </p> <p>Hollinger declined to comment on the timing of any new trial but hinted it would not appeal after its racketeering case was thrown out.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>First it was Mondays. Then Africa. Now it's marriage that's got Bob Geldof all in a stew. With some help from Germaine Greer and Ala(i)ns de Botton and Milburn, he painted a bleak picture of the institution in <strong> Geldof On Marriage</strong> (Channel 4). We're talking for worse here, rather than for better. Sickness not health. </p> <p>The promise has no meaning any more, moaned Bob, the newly (and self-) appointed patron saint of marriage. As a legal contract, it has been devalued. Not only do we make light of it, but we are allowed and encouraged by the law to make light of it. Perhaps Bob should get some car stickers made up to help his cause: \"A spouse is for life, not just for the wedding day.\" </p> <p>Because nothing seems to be for life any more. When we're bored of something we change it - a car, a TV station, a spouse. It's all about status, says Alain de Botton, but then he always says that. </p> <p>There's nothing to be happy about. Men are depressed, they don't talk. Women are depressed, they nag. We may even be losing the capacity to love each other. And when marriages do break down, as they inevitably do, the consequences are devastating. Children of divorced kids do badly at school, commit crime, go to prison, kill themselves. Divorced men kill themselves... </p> <p>Oh God, Bob! Stop it. Isn't there any good news? Not really, no. We're inflicting pain on ourselves and on our children. The state is doing nothing about it, despite divorce costing \u00a315bn a year. It can't go on like this. </p> <p>This was one gloomy film. And perhaps a surprising line for Geldof to take. Monogamy and family meals, that's not exactly very rock'n'roll. But rock'n'roll is not what Bob does now. He is now officially a bringer of bad news, and a moral crusader. He's so angry too. While his guests managed to be charming, to smile even, Bob just got crosser and crosser. The only time he made me smile was when he said, \"You would make a very good lapdancer, Germaine.\" </p> <p>Luckily, the film was punctuated by some real people talking about marriage; a lovely old couple who frequently forgot the question and rambled on about who knows what, but appeared to be very much in love, and a little girl who said: \"I don't know who he is or where he is, but he'll find me.\" </p> <p>Maybe there is some hope after all. </p> <p>With all its fancy whirly camera action, watching <strong> Spooks</strong> (BBC1) feels a bit like driving round and round a roundabout at considerable speed. The action's taking part in the middle of the roundabout, but as you're spinning round it, it's quite hard to know exactly what's going on. There's a bunch of impossibly young and glamorous MI5 operatives in there, mistrusting each other and talking in cliches. And isn't that Tom, who was last seen walking into the sea after shooting his boss? There's the JIC, steaming in to sort things out. And that nasty-looking geezer, he's from the CIA. But he's suppposed to be dead too. </p> <p>This roundabout is an interesting design. No daffodils or floral clocks here. Instead, there are park benches, a car park, a few London bridges. Because that's what spooks do - they sit on park benches, they hang about in car parks, they walk over London bridges. </p> <p>Round we whirl, getting a little dizzy and confused. Is Tom innocent? If he is, how will he convince them that it was the man from the CIA who set him up? Will the guy from the JIC get them all sacked? Sounds like fun, doesn't it? That's because it is. </p> <p>I like cars, and I've been to known to watch a car programme. But I'm not a big fan of <strong> Fifth Gear</strong> (Five). Clever name that: fifth gear, that's normally the top gear, and this is a bit like Top Gear, but on Five. So, Fifth Gear, see? </p> <p>Fifth Gear has none of the charm of Top Gear, though (and it's not often you see the word \"charm\" sharing a sentence with Top Gear). The BBC show has a bit of silliness, that oaf Clarkson, and guests. Fifth Gear is only about motors. </p> <p>On last night's show there was a feature on the Ford Capri. But there was nothing about its cultural significance. There was no mention of Bodie or Doyle - this was only about value, engine size and performance. </p> <p>While you might, possibly, see a girl watching Top Gear, which has a bit of glamour and swagger, Fifth Gear is only for boys, and serious petrol-head boys. Top Gear is James Hunt; Fifth Gear is Nigel Mansell.</p>",
  "<p>One of America's biggest television companies has announced plans to broadcast a film days before the presidential election that portrays the Democratic candidate John Kerry as betraying his fellow soldiers in Vietnam. </p> <p>The conservative Sinclair Broadcast Group will reportedly present the film as news on the 62 local channels it owns nationwide. </p> <p>The film will replace normal primetime programmes supplied by the national networks and reach up to a quarter of the electorate, many in critical battleground states, about a week before the election on November 2. </p> <p>In the film, Stolen Honour: Wounds That Never Heal, former US prisoners of war claim that their North Vietnamese interrogators used anti-war statements by Mr Kerry to undermine morale and persuade them to admit war crimes. </p> <p>A press release for the film, made by a conservative journalist and ex-marine, Carlton Sherwood, accused Mr Kerry of \"lies, false testimony and distortions\" for his remarks to Congress in 1971, saying US troops had been responsible for atrocities. </p> <p>The press release alleges that \"in mere moments in 1971, Kerry willingly gave the North Vietnamese what the brave PoWs had endured torture and solitary confinement to avoid saying\". </p> <p>Terry McCauliffe, the Democratic party chairman, said the the film was \"garbage\", and announced his intention to mount a legal challenge. </p> <p>Mr Kerry has been dogged by such attacks for more than two months, mostly in the form of advertisements paid for by a group calling itself Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. </p> <p>The Swift Boat advertisements, questioning Mr Kerry's combat record and criticising his activism in the early 1970s, helped give George Bush a clear lead in the polls which he has only lost in the past fortnight, after two lacklustre debate performances. </p> <p>Chad Clanton, a Kerry campaign spokesman, said: \"George Bush lost the first two debates according to every public poll, and now his allies are kicking into overdrive to distract from policy failures on Iraq and on the economy.\" </p> <p>\"If they move forward with this, they will be obliterating every decent journalistic standard in the book.\" </p> <p>Mr Sherwood's company, Red White And Blue Productions, has denied receiving support from the Bush campaign to make the film. Funding, it said, \"was made possible by Pennsylvania veterans\". Sinclair executives did not return a call seeking comment yesterday. </p> <p>They reportedly plan to define the programme as news, which under broadcasting law does not require equal time to be given for a response. </p> <p>Democrats will file a legal complaint today with the federal election commission arguing the broadcast represents an illegal campaign contribution. Democratic senators have also said they will appeal to the federal communications commission (FCC), to investigate the transmission of what they describe as free political advertising. </p> <p>The FCC is chaired by Michael Powell, the son of the secretary of state, Colin Powell. </p> <p>Under US broadcasting rules, the film actually gives airtime to Mr Kerry. Andrew Jay Schwartzman, who heads the Media Access Project watchdog, said: \"The way our equal time law works depends on what candidate is appearing on the air - so the equal time rule would run to Bush, not to Kerry. It does not provide Kerry a right to reply.\" </p> <p>\"What this shows is the dangers of media concentration. These are the problems that arise when one company controls 62 channels.\" </p> <p>Mark Hyman, Sinclair's vice-president for corporate relations, told the New York Times the company had invited Mr Kerry to appear after the film to answer the charges. \"There are certainly serious allegations that are levelled; we would very much like to get his response,\" Mr Hyman said. </p> <p>Mr Clanton said that although the Kerry camp would rule nothing out, \"it's hard to take an offer seriously from a group with such an obvious political agenda\". </p> <p>The film puts the Kerry campaign in a difficult position. Democrats said the campaign was too slow to respond to the original Swift Boat attacks; yet it is aware that its complaints will only provide publicity for Stolen Honour. </p> <p>Michael Moore, the director of the anti-Bush film Fahrenheit 9/11, wants to make it available on a pay-per-view basis on the eve of the election, but any audience is likely to be tiny compared to a film shown at primetime on 62 channels. </p> <p>The row has drawn attention to the role of television news. </p> <p>Fox News has established itself as a conservative network, while CBS has been under fire for broadcasting a documentary about Mr Bush's national guard record in September.</p>",
  "<p>David Scott, Channel 4's longest serving board member, announced his decision to leave the broadcaster yesterday in the first senior change since Andy Duncan started as chief executive. </p> <p>Mr Scott, a member of the channel's founding management team in 1982, has been its deputy chief executive since 2002. </p> <p>His decision to stand down next September comes at a time of great internal debate over the future of the publicly owned broadcaster. Channel 4's board was yesterday locked in a meeting, discussing its response to the report on public service broadcasting published by industry regulator Ofcom two weeks ago. </p> <p>Mr Scott, a former Channel 4 finance director, will continue to work on projects alongside Mr Duncan, including the channel's response to the Ofcom review. He denied that there had been any disagreement between the two. \"Andy is doing an absolutely excellent job and I am very happy with the direction he is taking,\" he said. \"But I have been here for a very long time and it's time to move on.\" </p> <p>He said: \"Under Andy and [chairman] Luke Johnson, I have no doubt that Channel 4 can face the challenges of delivering public service programmes in the digital future with confidence.\" </p> <p>Mr Scott, 50, has not decided what his next job will be, although he said that he did not imagine taking a full-time post. \"It's been quite a long, hard slog and I know it's a cliche, but I want to spend more time with my family.\" He has a 22-year-old son at university and a 19-year-old daughter. </p> <p>Having worked at the channel for so long, Mr Scott has also built up a healthy pension pot. At the end of last year, it stood at \u00a31.75m with an annual payout of \u00a3160,000. Although the normal retirement age is 60, there is an early retirement option from 50. </p> <p>Industry analysts believe that Channel 4 could be considering further job cuts as part of a cost-cutting exercise. Such a move was felt to have earned the implicit support of Ofcom, which urged the channel to look at forms of \"self-help\" last month. </p> <p>As part of a gradual scaling back of his responsibilities, Mr Scott will immediately give up his financial role to Sue Ford, who is the finance director. He will retain control over technology, legal affairs and channel operations until he eventually leaves in September. </p> <p>Mr Duncan said: \"David has been absolutely instrumental in building the strong financial and business foundations on which C4's fantastic track record of creative innovation has been based. His flair, his knowledge, his experience and his passionate commitment to the channel's unique public service mission will be keenly missed.\" </p> <p>Some industry insiders expressed surprise at the timing of Mr Scott's departure. </p> <p>One former executive, who wished to remain anonymous, said: \"It's hard to say whether David Scott's leaving is of strategic significance, except that he was the heart and soul of the channel and represented its history.\" </p> <p>He has worked with all 10 of the channel's chief executives and chairmen since 1982. </p> <p>Mr Duncan, a former head of marketing at the BBC, joined Channel 4 in July. The longest serving remaining executive on the board after Mr Scott's departure will be a veteran of seven years. </p> <p>Sue Ford was previously finance director of Channel 4's commercial arm, 4 Ventures.</p>",
  "Responding to years of lobbying by the film industry, the French government has legalised the use of mobile phone jamming devices in cinemas, theatres and concert halls, to prevent audiences being disturbed by ring tones and telephone conversations. <p>Sophisticated technology means people can be prevented from receiving and making mobile telephone calls within 30 metres of the device. </p> <p>Only emergency calls will be able to override the block. </p> <p>French film-makers have said the use of mobile phones in cinemas was resulting in a \"disastrous\" impact on ticket sales. The change in the law is part of the government's campaign to make cinemas more enticing. </p> <p>Patrick Devedjian, the French industry minister, said: \"It's the same for concerts. You know how it is when thugs let their phones ring during a concert.\" </p> <p>He added: \"But that's all over now.\" </p> <p>Until now, the use of blocking devices has been punishable with a fine of \u20ac30,000 (\u00a320,660) or a six-month prison sentence. </p> <p>French media said the jammers made by the British-based company Starport, which cost about \u20ac440, might be ordered for use in public auditoriums. </p> <p>The move was first debated in 2001. However, there was uncertainty over whether jammers could block telephone signals in cinemas and theatres without disrupting signals in the surrounding streets. </p> <p>A total block on calls has upset those who want to be contactable if their babysitter or employer needs to speak to them urgently. </p> <p>Previously, France's telecoms regulation authority has tried encouraging concert audiences to use the vibrate mode on their phones or to switch them off entirely, but with no apparent success. </p> <p>The president of the National Federation of French Cinema, Jean Labb\u00e9, said that jamming devices would transform the experience of going to the cinema in France. </p> <p>\"This will permit people to watch the film, and only the film,\" he told French radio. </p> <p>Prison officials and school governors are also campaigning to be allowed to install similar devices, and some restaurant owners are doing the same.</p>",

  "<b>\u00b7</b> We gave Paul Foot a wonderful send-off on Sunday. The celebration of his life, at the Hackney Empire, was moving and funny, but serious and stimulating about the many issues that mattered to him, most of them, in one way or another, to do with exposing and fighting unfairness, injustice and lies. <p>There was, unusually for such an occasion, not a dud speaker among the 20 or so who paid tribute to him, and none of them stayed on stage too long. I knew him in only one of his guises, as an extraordinary campaigner against miscarriages of justice in the courts. I marvelled at the sheer effort and enthusiasm he put into investigating cases where he believed there had been a wrongful conviction. </p> <p>We remember some of the high-profile ones - the murder of the newsboy Carl Bridgewater, for instance - but there were other cases that did not attract great publicity where Foot was responsible for getting the innocent out of prison. He died still believing that James Hanratty did not commit the murder for which he was hanged, insisting that the DNA sample that appeared to prove his guilt was contaminated. On the very day he died, he was preparing yet another article cogently arguing the innocence of Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami, convicted of conspiracy to bomb the Israeli embassy in London in 1996. Paul Foot mattered, and he is irreplaceable. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Etre et Avoir was a lovely film, everyone agreed - a gentle documentary on a French village school, complete with charming children and a dedicated teacher who believed in old-fashioned methods fast disappearing from the French educational system. It was so popular that it became France's most successful documentary ever. It earned a sizeable profit for its makers, but the subjects who had made the film so attractive - the children and Georges Lopez, the teacher - got nothing. This rankled. So Lopez and many of the families sued the film's producers, claiming that they had been exploited and misled, and demanding compensation. A French court has now ruled against Lopez (the families are continuing their lawsuit) but the issues raised have caused documentary film-makers to worry about their future. The courts may become more sympathetic to people like Lopez. Will it mean that all who feature in a documentary will have to be paid as if they were actors? And might that not distort the integrity of a documentary? What about photographers and artists? Would a modern-day Mona Lisa be able to tell Da Vinci: \"It's my smile that made your portrait of me so popular and valuable. I'm entitled to a slice of the action\"? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In an article in last week's London Review of Books, the appeal court judge Sir Stephen Sedley wonders whether replacing the law lords by \"justices of the supreme court\" will also mean the abolition of appeal court judges being referred to as \"Lord Justice\" (or the more recent Lady Justice). I certainly hope so. They are in no way lords, only ordinary sirs, and their judicial title causes no end of confusion among the public and often the media. Sedley explains that the great court reforms of the 1870s envisaged only one appeal court, to be manned by \"lords justices of appeal\"; then the House of Lords decided to take back its judicial functions and install a higher final court, with lords of appeal on it. But the now demoted appeal judges were allowed to keep their \"lord justice\" tag. There is no good reason to perpetuate that absurdity. </p> <p>And while we're about it, let's do what I've been urging for years and get rid of the Mr and Mrs in front of the \"Justice\" for high court judges. No one outside the legal world uses them anyway, and even Sedley's research couldn't establish why they emerged in the 18th century. Before that it had been mere \"Justice\", as in Justice Shallow in Shakespeare's Henry IV Part II. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> What intrigued me most about Cherie Booth QC's first American paid-for lecture (under her pseudonym Cherie Blair) was that she was a late substitute for Lauren Bacall. If I were an insurance agent, broker or executive - these categories constituted her luncheon audience at a golf club in West Virginia - and had paid to hear a Hollywood legend who had been married to Bogart and had dated Sinatra, I'd be displeased to find instead a barrister waffling on about employment law and goldfish, whose husband hadn't appeared in a single film classic. My theory is that, when Bacall dropped out, the insurance people were offered this woman from Matrix and thought they were getting a starlet from the movie.</p>",
  "The government will this week unveil ground-breaking plans to introduce reform bills before they are formally announced in the Queen's speech next month. <p>With an election likely in May or June, some bills could become casualties of a short session which is already due to start late - at the end of November - because of a \"ping pong\" logjam over controversial measures such as the hunting bill. </p> <p>Peter Hain, the leader of the Commons, is therefore hoping to use the normally quiet final weeks of the current session - when peers are busy mopping up legislation, but MPs have time to spare - to start work on two bills which he wants passed in the new session. </p> <p>Labour's controversial gambling bill, which will regulate gambling more carefully while allowing a lot more of it, is a likely candidate. </p> <p>So is a bill which has been subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny in draft form - either the measure to extend disability rights or to open up the scope of school transport. </p> <p>The option which should enable MPs to debate bills in late October and November, rather than time-filling end-of-term topics of a non-legislative nature, arises from reforms which were pushed through when Robin Cook was the leader of the Commons. </p> <p>They allow uncompleted legislation to be \"rolled over\" into the next session instead of being lost. </p> <p>Mr Hain's innovation, expected to be announced on Thursday, may cause trouble among tradition-minded MPs, not least because it anticipates the annual ritual whereby the Queen announces her ministers' plans in a speech from the throne. </p> <p>Even without a parliamentary spat over the Hain plan the government is facing a series of running battles as it works to get at least six bills on to the statute book by the end of the current session, November 17 or 19. </p> <p>The decision to reintroduce the hunting bill - and the announcement that the Queen's speech will be on November 23 - has made the already busy parliamentary timetable extra tight. </p> <p>With just five weeks to go, party business managers in the Lords believe all the bills will get through, though peers can expect to grumble through some late-night sessions. </p> <p>The following are the bills that need to get through: </p> <p><b>Hunting bill </b><br> </p> <p>Lord Strathclyde, the wily Tory leader in the Lords, indicated on Sunday that peers are likely to send this bill back to the Commons amended so that the \"middle way\" licensed form of hunting would still be permitted. </p> <p>That is the compromise Tony Blair backs, anxious to find a way out of a controversy in which partisans on both sides do not wish to give an inch. </p> <p>Given that this is a free vote, most backbench Labour MPs - hardened by the anti-hunt protesters in the Commons and by their own pledges to constituents - are past caring about their leader's feelings. </p> <p>They are expected to overturn the amendment before sending it back to the Lords for a third reading. </p> <p>The peers can re-amend and send the bill back, the annual parliamentary ping pong match in November, which usually results in the Lords backing down after extracting face-saving concessions. </p> <p>That is unlikely in the present angry mood, exacerbated by Labour threats to purge the upper house of its 92 remaining hereditary peers. </p> <p>The bill only starts its three-day examination in a Lords committee today and is expected to clog up at least five days of the hard-pressed parliamentary timetable. In the end Labour will invoke the rarely used Parliament Act and force the bill through. </p> <p><b>Housing bill </b><br> </p> <p>Began its three-day report stage in the Lords yesterday but peers do not anticipate a swift resolution. Its main controversy requires owners selling their homes to pay for a home-buyers information pack, which could cost them \u00a3300 to \u00a3500 or more. </p> <p>The issue generated massive debate in committee stage. Some Lords sources predict it could also be bounced back to the Commons; others predict that MPs will back down on John Prescott's pet scheme. </p> <p><b>Civil partnership bill </b><br> </p> <p>The bill which offers gay partners the same legal rights as married couples goes back to the Commons today after peers, including the former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit and the Bishop of Winchester, claimed that it would be unfair on cohabiting brothers and sisters if they do not have the same rights over property and inheritance as gay couples. Their amendment, passed by the Lords, will almost certainly be thrown out by the Commons as a deliberate piece of wrecking because of cost. Tory sources suggest peers will then accept the bill - particularly since it has the personal backing of Michael Howard. </p> <p><b>Pensions bill </b><br> </p> <p>This protects employees whose funds go bust, a hot issue for unions whose members have suffered badly. This requires two further days in committee and several days - perhaps as many as four - in report. </p> <p><b>Human tissue bill </b><br> </p> <p>The regulatory measure to prevent abuse of retained organs after the Alder Hey and Bristol hospital scandals has aroused some controversy. It has completed its Lords committee stage and should not now cause particular problems. </p> <p><b>Civil contingencies bill </b><br> </p> <p>This bill has aroused serious concern about the way it gives ministers sweeping powers to control the state - including the media - in the event of a major terrorist attack. Loyalists say concerns have now been addressed. </p> <p>Business managers predict that the bill, which goes back to the Lords on Thursday, may need four days in committee, and at least three on report stage. </p> <p>Tory and Liberal Democrat peers remain troubled on civil libertarian grounds. </p> <p><b>Children bill </b><br> </p> <p>Curbs parental smacking, though MPs may accept Lord Lester's attempt to create a compromise which falls short of an outright ban in all circumstances. Half a day is being timetabled for peers to scrutinise changes made in the Commons. </p> <p><b>Domestic violence bill </b><br> </p> <p>Ensures men suspected of hitting partners can be arrested for common assault; extends restraining orders; and places those under them on register. Also creates a new offence of familial homicide for parents or foster parents that allow the death of a child in their home. Another bill that should be dealt with swiftly with its report stage starting in the Commons today. It will then go back to the Lords in November, where any possible amendments are expected to be dealt with in half a day.</p>",
  "The Israeli army has begun investigating the death of a 13-year-old Palestinian girl said to have been shot dead by soldiers then riddled with bullets by their commander. <p>On television and in newspapers soldiers claimed that the officer shot her in the head and emptied a magazine of bullets into her body. </p> <p>Iman el Hamas was walking to school last week when she strayed near an Israeli army post in Rafah. Soldiers opened fire and killed her. </p> <p>The company commander then approached the body and fired two bullets at her head before switching his gun to automatic, the soldiers alleged. Doctors found more than 20 bullets in her body. </p> <p>The soldiers were so disgusted by the slow pace of an army investigation that they approached the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth to demand the officer's dismissal. </p> <p>One told the paper: \"The company CO who sprayed the girl with bullets turned us all into vicious animals and besmirched us all. </p> <p>\"As far as we are concerned, it is either him or us. If he is not dismissed, we will not agree to serve under him. </p> <p>\"It is a disgrace that he is still in his position. We want him to be kicked out in a legal fashion.\" </p> <p>The soldiers said the officer shot the girl even though he was told by members of his unit not to. </p> <p>One said: \"We spotted her at a distance of 70 metres. Shots were fired at her from the positions of the outpost, she ran away and was hit. I realised she was dead. </p> <p>\"The company CO approached her, shot two bullets into her, walked back towards the force, turned back to her, switched his weapon to automatic and emptied his entire magazine into her. </p> <p>\"He pumped her full of holes. We were in shock, we grabbed our heads. We couldn't believe what he was doing. Our hearts ached for her.\" </p> <p>At first the army said the soldiers had suspected that the girl was carrying a bomb. Later it said the girl was being used by gunmen to lure them from their post. </p> <p>Yesterday an army source said an investigation had begun, but it was \"too early to speak of criminal charges\". </p> <p>The girl's family insist that she was going to school and carrying only her schoolbooks. \"We demand the prosecution of Iman's killer, [but] we do not trust the Israeli judicial system,\" her elder brother, Ehab, said. </p> <p>\"We know that this area where the outpost was located is off limits, but no one can control kids all the time. Iman got up and had breakfast with five of her nine brothers, and took leave of her parents as she does every day on the way to school. </p> <p>\"Even if someone used the child, and I am certain it did not happen, she presented no danger to anyone,\" he said. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, survived two no-confidence votes in parliament yesterday after he vowed to continue with his plan to withdraw settlers and troops from some occupied territory.</p>",
  "<p>A valley where William the Conqueror struck his first camp after landing in England in 1066 could be bisected by a controversial new road which has reignited a bitter conflict dubbed \"the new battle of Hastings\". </p> <p>Leaders of Britain's top environmental groups have joined local activists to walk the route and to urge the government to block a \u00a347m highway project through the historic Combe Haven marshes. </p> <p>The marshes are in a valley between Pevensey, where the Norman conqueror landed, and Battle - the site of the battle of Hastings. </p> <p>The inland road, proposed by East Sussex's Conservative-controlled county council, is intended to relieve a congested seafront corridor carrying up to 32,000 vehicles a day between Hastings and its westerly neighbour, Bexhill. </p> <p>Its advocates say it would attract desperately needed investment to an area suffering from inaccessibility and a moribund tourism industry. </p> <p>Once a thriving resort, Hastings struggled to cope with the decline of seaside holidays. Eight thousand of the town's 85,000 people are unemployed, and five of its wards are among the most deprived 10% in Britain. </p> <p>The road poses an awkward dilemma for the transport secretary, Alistair Darling. His predecessor, Stephen Byers, rejected a bypass around Hastings on environmental grounds three years ago. </p> <p>Critics claim the new plan is an attempt by the local council to construct half of the bypass by stealth, with the prospect of adding the rest of it in the future. </p> <p>Critics say there is a hidden agenda to create a south-coast superhighway linking trunk routes all the way from Dover to Devon. Environmentalists say this is unnecessary and would wreak havoc in the picturesque South Downs. </p> <p>A local Transport 2000 campaigner, Derrick Coffee, said: \"The road would do nothing to improve regional access to Hastings. It would just create old-style ribbon development and it would lead to an even greater dependence on the car.\" </p> <p>The road would run just yards from the Combe Haven area of special scientific interest, which is renowned for its migrating birds, insects and plant species. </p> <p>The spot is used by local enthusiasts for duck shooting. </p> <p>Transport 2000, the Woodland Trust, the RSPB and the Campaign to Protect Rural England have formed an alliance against the scheme, which they describe as \"one of the most damaging and unnecessary road proposals in the entire country\". </p> <p>But the civic leaders of Hastings insist that something needs to be done to make the town easier to get to. </p> <p>Hastings is equidistant with Brighton from London but takes half an hour longer by train. </p> <p>The town has no dual carriageways and East Sussex is one of England's few counties without a motorway. </p> <p>Duncan Jordan, assistant director of East Sussex council, said: \"There is a real lack of connectivity. The rail services and the road network are far behind what you would expect from a modern town.\" </p> <p>The authority says the new road would relieve noise and pollution suffered by residents on the existing A259. It would also provide capacity for a more reliable bus service between Bexhill and Hastings. An application to improve rail services has failed to secure funding. </p> <p>Alongside the road, the council has plans for a 48,000 square metre business park on an out-of-town greenfield site and 1,100 new homes. </p> <p>Local businessman Paul Evans, who chairs Hastings' chamber of commerce 1066 Enterprise, said: \"In the long term this will release land for industrial development and it meets the deputy prime minister's objective of more homes in the south-east.\" </p> <p>Mr Darling is due to make a decision on the proposal by the end of the year, alongside several other contentious projects including a scheme to widen the A303 through the Blackdown Hills in Somerset. </p> <p>His ruling will be viewed as a litmus test of the government's approach to transport. </p> <p>Although his enthusiasm for speed cameras enrages motoring organisations, Mr Darling has been accused of abandoning Labour's original aim of prising drivers out of their cars. </p> <p>He has scrapped 10-year targets of tripling cycle use and increasing rail travel by 50%. He has also approved the widening of London's orbital M25 and he has set out plans for a new toll motorway between Birmingham and Manchester. </p> <p>Paul de Zylva, of Friends of the Earth, said: \"This is a test case of whether we can regenerate areas without roadbuilding. We can't just have little doughnuts of tranquillity and rich heritage, with concrete and mayhem all around them.\"</p>",
  "Ministers are determined to press ahead with legislation to set up a single equality body, despite the Commission for Racial Equality's unexpected rejection of the merger with the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Disability Rights Commission. <p>The deputy minister for women and equality, Jacqui Smith, told the Guardian yesterday that no single body had a veto on the merger and she wanted to put the legislation on the statute book before the general election next year. </p> <p>\"All the other equality bodies and business, and the Disability Rights Commission supported the proposals that we consulted on with respect to a single commission,\" she said. </p> <p>\"The priority now is that we make progress, but clearly in a way that reassures the CRE and its stakeholders that actually a new body will strengthen the ability to tackle racism wherever it occurs. But to do that we need to make progress and get on with it. </p> <p>\"Nobody has a veto over this process ... But we are looking at and talking to the CRE about all of their concerns and what is going to be necessary in the new body to maintain for all the groups some of the 'strand specific' work that they do. </p> <p>\"This is not about saying that all discriminations are the same.\" </p> <p>Asked if the new body would go ahead without the CRE, she said: \"I don't believe we will get into that position.\" </p> <p>She made it clear that the merging of the discrimination watchdogs into a commission for equality and human rights was not about setting up a new \"very big lobby group\" but the creation of a \"modern light touch regulator\". </p> <p>She confirmed that the early work of the new commission would include drawing up a new equality act, which would untangle some of the shortcomings and complexities of the existing discrimination laws. </p> <p>These included the fact that it was not yet illegal to discriminate in employment on the grounds of age. There were \"some quite difficult issues, especially about extending [protection against ageism] to the provision of goods, facilities and services. </p> <p>\"I would expect the commission to look in detail at these inconsistencies across the legislation and whether and how the consistency might be created between the different groups.\" </p> <p>Ms Smith confirmed that she expected the bill, to be introduced this autumn, to redeem Labour's 1999 pledge to introduce a wider duty on the public sector to promote equality between men and women. </p> <p>This would put equal opportunities work on the same footing as the new duty on public bodies to promote racial equality. </p> <p>The role of the new equality and human rights commission was boosted by Tony Blair's announcement in his Labour conference speech of the decision to extend the ban on religious discrimination to the provision of goods, facilities and services.</p>",
  "<p>It is a tragic irony that the actor Christopher Reeve, who has died of heart failure aged 52, was renowned for two such contrasting roles: Superman, the supreme physical specimen, and a man paralysed from the neck down. Unfortunately, the latter was all too real. </p> <p>In 1995, with his film career flourishing, Reeve, a keen rider, broke his neck when he was thrown from his horse during an equestrian competition in Virginia. After years of therapy, and despite pessimistic prognostications, he remained determined to walk again, and became a symbol of hope for quadriplegics like himself. \"I refuse to allow a disability to determine how I live my life,\" he said. \"I don't mean to be reckless, but setting a goal that seems a bit daunting actually is very helpful toward recovery.\" </p> <p>In 2000, Reeve was able to move his index finger and breathe for longer and longer periods without a respirator. He also regained sensation in other parts of his body. He dedicated almost all his energy to lobbying the US Congress for better insurance protection against catastrophic injury, and giving support to stem cell research. </p> <p>It would be a pity, however, if his heroic and heartrending situation obscured Reeve's many acting achievements. After all, he appeared in a total of 17 feature films, a dozen television movies and about 150 plays. </p> <p>Reeve was born into an intellectual family in New York; his father FD Reeve is a noted novelist, poet and scholar of Russian literature; his mother, the journalist Barbara Johnson. He enjoyed a stimulating childhood environment that included Sunday dinners with the poets Robert Frost and Robert Penn Warren, and the politician and academic Daniel Patrick Moynihan. </p> <p>The atmosphere was such that Reeve's father was disappointed to learn that the role of Superman that his son had been offered was not one in the George Bernard Shaw play, Man And Superman. </p> <p>Reeve started acting while a pupil at the exclusive Princeton day school. \"I never once asked myself, 'Who am I?' or 'What am I doing?,'\" he recalled. \"Right from the beginning, the theatre was like home to me. It seemed to be what I did best. I never doubted that I belonged in it.\" Appropriately, after high school he toured the country as Celeste Holm's leading man in The Irregular Verb To Love. </p> <p>While at Cornell University, New York state, he majored in music theory and English, and spent time studying theatre in Britain and France. In London, he worked at the Old Vic. \"I was a glorified errand boy, but it was a very exciting time. I helped by teaching the British actors to speak with an American accent. Then I went to Paris to work with the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise.\" </p> <p>In lieu of his final year at Cornell, Reeve was one of two students (Robin Williams was the other) accepted at the Juilliard School of Performing Arts, New York. There, he studied under the celebrated John Houseman, supporting himself financially with a role in the long-running television soap, Love Of Life. His looks and his athletic, 6ft 4in frame made him perfect material for a soap-opera hero. </p> <p>In 1976, he won the coveted role of Katharine Hepburn's grandson in a Broadway production of Enid Bagnold's A Matter Of Gravity. That same year, he got a small part in Gray Lady Down, a submarine adventure film. </p> <p>It was while appearing in an off-Broadway production that Reeve successfully screen-tested for the 1978 movie Superman - the most inspired casting of an unknown in a series since Sean Connery's James Bond. Reeve portrayed Superman as \"somebody that you can invite home for dinner ... What makes [him] a hero is not that he has power, but that he has the wisdom and the maturity to use the power wisely. From an acting point of view, that's how I approached the part.\" </p> <p>Of playing Clark Kent, Superman's alter ego, Reeve reckoned that \"there must be some difference stylistically between Clark and Superman. Otherwise, you just have a pair of glasses standing in for a character.\" Though he played the two roles without any sign of camp, he revealed a deft Cary Grant-inspired comic timing. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the three sequel films were a matter of diminishing returns and, after Superman IV: The Quest For Peace (1987), Reeve determined to \"escape the cape\". As he explained, \"I've flown, become evil, loved, stopped and turned the world backward. I've faced my peers, befriended children and small animals and rescued cats from trees. What else is there left for Superman to do?\" </p> <p>Away from his role as the man of steel, he portrayed a wide range of characters in films that included the love fantasy Somewhere In Time (1980); the thriller Death-trap (1982); Monsignor (1982), where, in the title role, he wore a cape again; and two Merchant-Ivory period pieces, The Bostonians (1984) and The Remains Of The Day (1993). </p> <p>He also showed his ability at farce in Switching Channels (1988) and Noises Off (1992). Further proof of his versatility came on stage in The Aspern Papers, in London with Vanessa Redgrave and Dame Wendy Hiller, Beaumarchais' The Marriage Of Figaro in New York, and Tennessee Williams' Summer And Smoke in Los Angeles, as well as touring in Love Letters. </p> <p>Before his accident, Reeve seemed to have everything. He was an accomplished pianist and a superb athlete. He earned his pilot's licence in his early 20s, and twice flew solo across the Atlantic. He also flew gliders and was an expert sailor, scuba diver and skier, though horses were his great passion. He returned to acting in 1998, in a TV movie update of Hitchcock's Rear Window, which, though a remarkable feat, was treated as a freak show. </p> <p>He is survived by his parents; by his wife Dana Morosini, whom he married in 1992, and their son; and by a son and daughter from an earlier long relationship with modelling executive Gae Exton. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Reed writes: </strong><br> Christopher Reeve's nine-year campaign for medical research into paralysis brought encouragement to millions worldwide, and he even forecast that he would walk again one day. His fame and personal efforts - such as a surprise appearance at the 1996 Oscar award ceremony in his wheelchair - substantially boosted money for research. </p> <p>Under the slogan \"Stand up for those who can't\", his Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation (CRPF), which, in 1999, merged with the American Paralysis Association, gave away millions of dollars to fund research and improve the quality of life for people suffering such injuries. </p> <p>Last July, the CRPF announced a grant of $779,000 to 126 non-profit organisations as part of its annual donations to help sufferers. When the programme began in 1999, only 20 groups benefited. Last May, the foundation donated $2m for individual research initiatives in Israel, a world leader in the field of paralysis injuries. </p> <p>Professor Geoff Raisman, director of the spinal repair unit at University College London, had been due to visit Reeve in December to discuss his work. Raisman and his team hope to start human trials in the next three years to help restore movement to people severely disabled like Reeve, using cells from the nasal cavity. \"Reeve was an inspiration,\" said Raisman. \"I knew him, and he had had a lot of hope in what we were doing.\" </p> <p>Another important project was the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Act, a law proposed in the US Congress to help paralysed Americans and fund research, which received bi-partisan support when it was launched last year. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Christopher Reeve, actor and campaigner, born September 25 1952; October 10 2004</p>",
  "Where only three months ago the two main political parties were locked in fierce competition on similar sounding solutions - choice in health and education, more control on crime and asylum - a large gap opened yesterday with Tony Blair's response to Michael Howard's speech to last week's Conservative conference. Mr Howard was blunt: \"Politicians don't have all the solutions. They should stop pretending they do ... we will only promise what we can deliver.\" Indeed, he went further, criticising Mr Blair for his rhetoric, dreams and belief in destiny when \"most people don't actually want a date with destiny. They just want a date with a dentist.\" <p>Undeterred, in a speech on reforming the welfare state, Mr Blair proudly defended \"grand visions and great causes\", rejecting the Tory option of \"minimalist politics, an offer so bare that its very paucity is supposed to give it credibility\". Of course the last thing the political system needs is vacuous visions, but on balance we side with Mr Blair. There are still \"great causes\" for social policy to achieve. </p> <p>Labour's pledge to abolish child poverty is a \"great cause\", but one which the government should have openly done more to celebrate, rather than hide it away in the interests of keeping its more conservative supporters on board. Second, its plans to open up a completely new frontier of the welfare state - universal, affordable and flexible childcare for all three to 14-year-olds from 8am to 6pm - is a \"vision\" that puts it far ahead of opposition parties as we noted yesterday. Third, next week's report from the Tomlinson review of 14 to 19-year-olds, opens up an opportunity to transform the status of vocational education, ending a blight stretching back a century. </p> <p>Like Margaret Thatcher before him, Mr Blair believes that to win a third term a party in government has to demonstrate it has not run out of ideas. But unlike Mrs Thatcher, Mr Blair already has an impressive list of social policy achievements. Mrs T's most radical social changes - the national curriculum, national tests and the internal NHS market - all came in her third term. The biggest danger yesterday was that the prime minister would announce even more new ideas for health and education, when both those services desperately need a period of stability to implement the flurry of policies already announced. There are so many in health - devolution, choice, money following patient, competition, more use of the private sector - that they have begun to bump into each other. Thankfully, he resisted this temptation. Beneath his rhetoric, the only \"new\" initiative was an expansion of private treatment centres, which will rightly rile Labour's backbenchers, but in reality only lifts their work to 10% of elective surgery by 2008. </p> <p>Four five-year plans - for health, education, transport and crime control - only published in July is another reason why it was going to be difficult to come up with a new idea. Critics who accuse this government of not having a strategic vision could not be more wrong. No government since the second world war has been clearer about where it wants to go on domestic policy. Its systematic and rational approach is a welcome relief from earlier Labour policy-making models, under which last-minute resolutions of consolidated slogans were pushed with much arm-twisting through the annual conference preceding the election. </p> <p>Mr Blair pointed to valid new goals - public health, social mobility, pensions - without spelling out how they would be improved. Do not expect any answers on pensions until after the election. Adair Turner, the head of the government's pension commission, will explain why today with the publication of his interim report. There are only three ways to more security in retirement: more tax, compulsory savings, later retirements.</p>",
  "A 14-year-old girl who was shot dead as she returned from an evening out with a group of friends at Nottingham's medieval Goose Fair was yesterday described by her headteacher as \"beautiful, vivacious and popular\". <p>As the hunt for Danielle Beccan's killer continued, a special assembly was held yesterday morning for hundreds of pupils at Elliot Durham school. Many signed a book of condolence. </p> <p>Valerie Penny-Stewart, the headteacher, said: \"She had immense potential and was one of our brightest students. She had a wide circle of friends who loved her. All are immensely saddened by the violent and cruel way in which her life was ended. </p> <p>\"We, as a school, stand together to ask for peace in our society and to demand justice for Danielle's death.\" She urged the community to \"knit together as never before\" at this time. </p> <p>Nottinghamshire police continued to search for a gold Citroen car with blacked out windows which was seen to pull up near the group of friends. </p> <p>One of the friends noticed a gun and told Danielle to get down on the ground, but she was too slow. At least six bullets were fired and Danielle collapsed after being hit in the stomach. Her mother, Paula, who has two other young children, heard the gunshots and ran round the corner to find her daughter on the ground. </p> <p>Danielle died on the operating table at Queen's Medical Centre. </p> <p>Last night Assistant Chief Constable Sue Fish said the police were anxious to identify the occupants of the car and she issued a warning to anyone who was in the vehicle. \"It may be that there were some people in the car who did not know what was going to happen. </p> <p>\"It may be events that night went further than they thought and I would appeal to anyone who was in that car to come forward and tell us what happened. </p> <p>\"I want you to look in the mirror and if the person looking back at you is not prepared to come forward and speak then you are as guilty as the person who pulled the trigger.\" </p> <p>Superintendent Dave Colbeck said the police had not established a motive for the killing. \"Danielle was not part of any drug or gang culture,\" he said. \"She was an innocent girl on her way home from a fair. I shudder to think that someone has targeted a 14-year-old girl - and we need to establish a motive.\" </p> <p>Police denied the situation was out of control and said that unlike two years ago, they were getting a great deal of help from members of the community desperate for a change in the inner-city suburb of St Ann's. </p> <p>Yesterday a man who had been questioned in connection with the incident was released. </p> <p>In a brief statement, Danielle's grandfather, Alvin Beccan, said: \"It's been very rough. Her mother is just about coping. We are all very, very shocked.\" </p> <p>The leader of Nottingham city council, Jon Collins, said: \"This is an absolutely senseless crime and a tragic waste of a young life. I want to encourage anyone who has information about this crime to come forward and help the police with their investigation. Whoever did this is dangerous and needs to be caught and brought to justice. </p> <p>\"The incident is a dreadful reminder of just how damaging gun crime can be to people's lives and the life of communities in places like Nottingham. The tiny minority of people who are prepared to use guns with criminal intent need to understand that society will not tolerate such appalling behaviour.\" </p> <p>He acknowledged that gun-related crime was a serious issue in Nottingham, but it was not unique to the city. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately, it's very easy to label Nottingham following an incident like this and jump to conclusions about how safe it is to go out at night, but most people would not recognise Nottingham as being that place,\" he added. </p> <p>\"While even one shooting is one too many, the last incident before this happened in May, so Nottingham is no different to any other large city in its experience of gun-related crime.\"</p>",
  "Witnesses who fear retribution from criminals should be allowed to conceal their identities when testifying in court, Nottinghamshire's chief constable urged yesterday. <p>Steve Green made the call in an interview with the Guardian, as he pledged to do everything in his power to catch the killers of 14-year-old Danielle Beccan, shot dead in Nottingham on Saturday. Danielle, who had no gang or criminal links, seems to have just been in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p> <p>Mr Green, who visited the murder scene and talked to people in the St Ann's area yesterday, acknowledged that witnesses might be scared, but hoped that the shocking murder of a child would spur them to come forward and help police. </p> <p>While he conceded that Danielle's murder was a devastating blow, he claimed his force was having considerable success in stemming the rising tide of drug and gun crime in Nottingham in recent years. </p> <p>The former army officer and advocate of tough policing called on other public agencies and the community to work together to help police to defeat the gangsters and stop young people being dragged into gun culture. </p> <p>\"Danielle's murder was a dreadful, horrible crime, and I, like everyone else, feel great anger that an innocent girl's life has been taken away,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But I'm determined to turn that community anger into help for our investigation. A lot of people are coming forward to make statements and there is a real possibility that there is such outrage at this murder that any reservations people have about helping police will be put aside. </p> <p>\"The witness protection scheme is not perfect. But if people have concerns about giving evidence, we will do our utmost to help them. I accept that if one person makes a statement that person may have a problem, but if 100 people make statements then the criminals have a problem. </p> <p>\"I say to Danielle's killers: Give yourselves up now, because we will catch you, and you will go to prison for a very long time.\" </p> <p>Mr Green said government should consider new moves to let witnesses' identities be withheld in court if there was a risk of a revenge attack. </p> <p>Nottingham has suffered seven gun murders in the past two years and an average of one shooting incident a week last year, and Nottinghamshire police force has come in for criticism in recent government reports. </p> <p>But Mr Green said his force's Operation Stealth was making significant impact on guns, and its comprehensive drugs strategy was clamping down on dealers and keeping addicts away from crime. </p> <p>Gun crime is down 40% month on month, but Mr Green admitted there were still problems, and he insisted policing alone could not challenge gun culture. </p> <p>\"That has to be done in partnership with other public agencies and the focus now needs to shift to local authorities, schools, youth services, to protect young people and create diversionary activities, things to do, places to go, to stop young people being dragged into gun culture.\"</p>",
  "If you have recently been mugged or burgled, please don't complain. Be positive. According to Polly Toynbee and the Guardian, you are living in a virtually crime free country. <p>I visited Brixton on a Saturday night not long ago. In the two hours I spent out on the streets, I did not see a single policeman. To me, and most of the public, the lack of a police presence in our inner-cities at night is a cause for real concern. </p> <p>Polly Toynbee and the Guardian don't apparently share this concern. They've howled in protest at my comments and demanded an apology. But no one has contradicted what I said - for the simple reason that I spoke the truth. </p> <p>Ms Toynbee has implied that my choice of Brixton for a walkabout has \"racist overtones\". Playing the race card is meant to undermine any legitimate point you have to make. It is designed to shut down debate and discussion. </p> <p>As it happens, I was in Brixton because I was invited by volunteers from local churches. They call themselves Street Pastors and, sadly for Ms Toynbee, they are black. Perhaps she thinks they are racist too. </p> <p>I don't. I think they are concerned, active citizens. Every night in Brixton the Street Pastors go out in teams. They told me that they are responding to the level of street crime and the concerns of ordinary people - black and white - who feel their streets are unsafe. Like me, they believe that people are reassured by a police presence on the street. It means that there is someone you can turn to if you feel threatened or if you need to report a crime. </p> <p>Her second line of attack was to take refuge in selective statistics. When she talks about crime nationally, Ms Toynbee prays in aid the British Crime Survey. Perhaps she should listen to what the independent Crime and Society Foundation has to say. It argues that there are \"significant flaws\" in the BCS and that it \"stretched credibility\" to suggest crime is falling. The BCS excludes lots of crimes from its calculations - such as murder, crimes against children under 16, sexual offences, dealing and taking drugs, and shoplifting. It is estimated that around 12 million crimes a year don't even make it on to the BCS radar. </p> <p>The most reliable crime statistics - those crimes recorded by the police - show that crime in England and Wales has risen by almost 850,000 in the past five years. While burglary and car crime have fallen, gun crime has doubled; robbery has gone up by more than half; and, most damning of all, violent crime has increased by 83%. Last year, it hit the 1 million mark for the first time ever. That is 3,000 violent crimes every day - more than 100 violent crimes every hour. </p> <p>When it comes to Lambeth, Ms Toynbee is quite happy to use the recorded crime statistics to make the point that crime in Brixton has fallen. This is welcome, and I am happy to congratulate the police for their success. But she failed to mention that violent crime in Lambeth has risen by almost 10% in the past five years. Violent crime really frightens people - and a police presence on the streets helps to reassure the public. </p> <p>When I became home secretary my officials gave me a graph. It showed crime rising inexorably. Crime, they said, would always go up. My job was simply to manage the public's expectations. I did not take that advice. I worked closely with the police to make it possible for them to combat crime and bring criminals to justice. By the time I left office, crime had fallen by nearly a million a year. </p> <p>The next Conservative government will renew the fight against crime. In particular, we will get rid of the unnecessary paperwork and bureaucracy that keeps the police handcuffed to their desks. We will scrap the politically correct form Labour are introducing that police officers will have to fill in every time they stop someone. Not stop and search, just stop someone. And we will recruit 5,000 more police officers a year. This will get more police out on the street fighting crime. </p> <p>Ms Toynbee has never let the facts get in the way of a story. Not very long ago she accused me of devoting my maiden speech to a call for the restoration of the death penalty. You don't have to be an investigative journalist to track down the contents of a maiden speech. It's published in Hansard. My maiden speech contained no reference to the death penalty. </p> <p>So if Ms Toynbee can put aside her prejudices and focus on the facts, we may yet be able to have an honest and reasonable debate - on crime and the causes of crime, on the most accurate statistics to measure it by and on the failure of the current government to make any progress in dealing with it. I would welcome that debate. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Michael Howard is leader of the Conservative party </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:blackg@parliament.uk\">blackg@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>I started at the college in September. It's lovely: not too big, not too small, and it's in the middle of lots of trees, so it's really natural. I chose e-media because I was looking for a course where I could use art and computers. I am from France and this course doesn't exist there. I have got a French baccalaureate, which was enough for me to get on to the course. It's an area of work that is growing, so I'm hoping it will lead to a good job in the future.</p> <p>There are about 16 of us in the class, ranging from ages 17 to 19, with only two girls. The boys are nice to us and we get on well as a group. Our course leader encourages us to work as a team.</p> <p>So far we've had a look at different web animation programs and started an assignment about copyright and law. We've also been given an advert to do for the college to encourage people to recycle.</p> <p>I like the fact that we don't have exams - it makes it less stressful and it means we can spend all the time we need on our assignments. It's good for me because, with English being a foreign language, I need all the time I can get. I have been to see the learner support officer and she was really nice. If I need any help with my assignments, like help with correcting my English, I can go to her.</p> <p>The tutors are really friendly, which is very different from France. They talk to the students as equals and really take care of us, always making sure we understand what we're being taught. We meet the lead tutor regularly and there are people we can go to if we have any problems.</p> <p>I have just started a part-time job in a cafe during my day off in the week and for one day at the weekend. If it gets too much, I will do fewer hours. My priority is my college work: I really want to get good marks.</p> <p>I might start working when I leave college, but I'm not sure.

  "<p>Ledero primary school, in the Samburu district of northern Kenya, is a cluster of buildings so isolated one wonders where the hundreds of children who crowd its weather-beaten classrooms appear from each morning. Among them is 10-year-old Saweina Lerantilei, who joined the school - her first - this year.</p> <p>Saweina has glaucoma and severe deformity of the eye sockets, which causes her eyes to bulge and a never-ending bubbling of tears that she constantly blinks away. Amid the cheery hubbub of class 1, she sits shyly at the front, close to the blackboard; close, too, to the doorway that allows her maximum light, but also invites in clouds of dust that leave clothes and papers salted with dirt. But, says her teacher, Zachary Mbugua, she is happy.</p> <p>\"Initially, the other pupils looked down upon her. They were seeing her as different. With time and interaction, they are now together. Now, when the children go home, they talk to their parents ... the attitudes become different.\"</p> <p>Saweina was not sent to school by her parents. She was found abandoned under a tree by Grace Seneiya, an itinerant teacher charged with tracking down children with visual impairments and placing them in school.</p> <p>Seneiya trawls the Samburu landscape on a motorbike; a chance puncture stalled her where Saweina had been left. When she found the girl's mother, she scorned the idea of an education for her daughter. \"But I told her, 'this girl will go to school and she will be a better person because of it'.\"</p> <p>The Samburu people who populate these 20,800 sq km of savannah and desert are closely related to the Masai of southern Kenya; they share a language, a semi-nomadic lifestyle and a bleak attitude towards disability.</p> <p>Seneiya is the linchpin of the Kenya Integrated Education Programme (Kiep), a national scheme supported by eye health charity Sightsavers International. Some 90% of visually impaired children worldwide do not go to school, an issue that this Thursday's world sight day will highlight. With 80% of blindness preventable, schools assume an additional importance - from screening for early signs of damage, to simple lessons in hygiene, to ensuring blind children are not confined to the home. Often they are shackled and deprived of food; sometimes they are killed or abandoned. School would be an unthinkable luxury for children thought unlikely to be of use to the family.</p> <p>\"There are 50,000 children in the Samburu region, but 25,000 of them are getting no education,\" says Benjamin Kirombe, headteacher of St Mary's primary in Maralal. \"It is a problem for parents - who will be looking after the cattle?\"</p> <p>St Mary's has two visually impaired pupils, sisters who learn alongside their sighted peers, sharing their lessons, playground games and aspirations. Hilda Naitoti, 11, wants to be a pilot. She works hard; her favourite subjects are English and social studies.</p> <p>Hilda has conjunctivitis, a normally minor infection that has - through a combination of lack of treatment and the stinging dust that hurls itself across the schoolyard - left her almost blind. She can't see to read her books. \"I have friends who help me read what is on the blackboard,\" she says.</p> <p>\"My eyes are full of tears when I try to read, and I have to stop,\" says her sister, Adela Mary, nine, who also suffers from poor vision. \"I have no problem playing with my friends, but the sun hurts my eyes and I have to go back to class. Sometimes my friends come with me, but most of the time I come alone.\"</p> <p>Hilda and Adela's parents are educated, though their salaries - the mother earns around 5,000 Kenyan shillings a month (about \u00a335) as a nurse, their teacher father slightly more - will not cover the cost of the seven-hour trip to Nairobi for treatment. But the girls are, at least, in school.</p> <p>Parental resistance to educating \"worthless\" children is one of Seneiya's greatest challenges. Labelled a devil by some, her results soon transform suspicion into devotion: children with \"old man's eyes\" see again after cataract operations; blind children gain mobility, skills, careers even, once she has wrestled their parents into allowing them to attend school.</p> <p>Last year, the Kenyan government introduced free, universal primary education for ages six to 16, a seismic policy in a region like Samburu, where 83% live below the poverty line. Those majority of children whose parents could not afford yearly fees of around 2,000KS (\u00a315) now heave themselves into overburdened classrooms to learn maths, English, Kiswahili, religious education and civics. Kiep's aim is to make sure visually impaired children are side by side with them.</p> <p>There is no inclusion debate in Kenya as there is in the UK; no dilemma between specialist provision and mainstream schooling. For reasons of geography and cost, there is often no alternative to children of all abilities learning together.</p> <p>\"Integration is not a bad thing because my friends are happy to assist me. That's why I continue,\" says Joseph Letura, 16, a pupil at Kirisia secondary school. Aged three, Joseph caught measles and lost much of his vision. Now he can read only one letter at a time, holding the book so close to his eye that his lashes skim the page. Next year he will sit national exams for university. He will have an extra half-hour painstakingly to piece together the answers that will determine his future.</p> <p>His present is shaky enough: a donor who had been paying his fees - secondary education, the equivalent of a UK sixth form, is not free - died last year, and the debt has climbed to around 60,000KS (\u00a3430). Though the school has allowed him to stay, the money will have to be found.</p> <p>Maring Nkitok, 14, who is totally blind, also as a result of measles, faces similar problems. \"I want to join secondary school, and then after that I go to Kenya school of law [at the University of Nairobi]. I want to be a lawyer,\" he says. He is currently at Maralal primary; \"we have very high expectations for him,\" says his headteacher, Christopher Lenguris. But funding those expectations will be a struggle.</p> <p>Seneiya has no doubt she will find the fees; she has fought too hard for these boys for lack of money to block their escape route. She began teaching at 19 in Baragoi, where Kiep was based. A two-year spell away in the mid-90s to acquire her special needs diploma coincided with a terrible period of banditry in Baragoi. Many were killed, schools were closed, and the programme was, like many of the children it had been helping, abandoned.</p> <p>Seneiya set about retrieving the pupils who had been dispersed. Joseph she found tending his brother's animals. \"When Madam Grace came to take me, sometimes I don't eat, I don't even have clothes,\" he says. \"I don't know where I would be now. I would not be in school.\"</p> <p>Where he ended up was Seneiya's own two-roomed home, with nine other children. She eventually secured funding for two dormitories, now home to 78 children, many of whom attend Maralal primary, a few minutes' rocky walk away.</p> <p>Kiep is now housed in Maralal, which has managed to create an atmosphere of inclusion that would be remarkable in a school with far greater resources. Some 1,045 children hurtle daily across the scratchy play area, kept in perfect check by 29 teachers, six of whom are trained in special needs. Eighteen children here are visually impaired, six totally blind; many more have other disabilities. Most learn alongside their peers. Nine-year-old Leunga Lolkinyali, fully sighted, is learning Braille to help his friend John Lokur, who is totally blind (and something of a maths whizz).</p> <p>But textbooks are not produced in Braille; when the curriculum changes, as happened recently, schools that have laboriously punched out Braille versions must start again. Seneiya has never seen a large-print textbook in the district. \"We are just too far,\" she says.</p> <p>And too few: last year, there were six itinerant teachers trekking the region in search of children to wheedle into schools. Now there are two: Seneiya and her colleague Reuben Leletia. The going was simply too tough, Seneiya explains. She herself has fallen six times from her bike - provided and frequently patched up by Sightsavers - and it is not uncommon for parts of her beat to be so inhospitable that she must walk instead. And that is before the nomadic tendencies of the Samburu come into play: \"Sometimes I drive all day for a home visit, then the home is no longer there.\"</p> <p>It is not a problem she will encounter with the Lakaldero family. Living in a manyatta (homestead) constructed of cedar wood, this is a family that has disregarded the convention that would normally have kept the two visually impaired children from the brood of 16 hidden in the tiny hut. Instead, Rasini, 11, is at school, and Kampeina, four, soon will be. After operations to correct their cataracts, both can walk the 3km to the nearest primary. \"Seven children are in school; the others are still very young,\" says their father, Titus. \"But I will take them all.</p> <p>\"I want them to go to school so in the future they can help me. The world is changing, and I know that without education there is no future.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sightsavers.org\">www.sightsavers.org</a></p>",
  "<p>The prime minister was once asked at question time to explain his political philosophy. He appeared completely flummoxed by this unusual request from fellow Labour MP Tony McWalter, a member of the British Philosophy Association.</p> <p>For the BPA's founding chairman, Professor Roger Trigg, Tony Blair's shambling response was a telling moment. \"I found it incredible that he was so thrown,\" says Trigg, in his study at Warwick University. \"It's not as though Downing Street hadn't been informed beforehand. The Conservatives looked equally baffled that such a question should be asked. My view is that people in public life do have a philosophical background and operate within certain moral assumptions, but it's not examined enough.\"</p> <p>Wouldn't Blair claim that his moral assumptions come from Christianity?</p> <p>\"It's a pity he didn't say that when he had the chance,\" says Trigg. \"There are issues of harm and benefit that are there in the world which are not just matters of opinion,\" he goes on. \"I wouldn't want to say that 50 years ago apartheid was right and now it isn't, or that slavery was right 200 years ago. Those things were wrong then and they're wrong now.\"</p> <p>Trigg's ongoing work is centred on the interface between private and public morality, between the law of the land and the concept of justice. His latest book is called Morality Matters. \"Not just,\" he argues, \"because it should govern our personal behaviour and the way we treat others. It should also provide the context in which all affairs are conducted, and nations governed. Morality can never be the product of individual whim or passing fashion. It is the key foundation of any properly ordered society.\"</p> <p>The philosopher is only too well aware that his book's publication coincides with widespread disillusion with governments on both sides of the Atlantic on the issue of trust.</p> <p>\"I started to write it two years ago when I was visiting Princeton University in the US,\" he says. \"They offered me a place in their Research Institute. American academics are more conscious of the way their work relates to the real world. Philosophers are invited to sit on public commissions in the White House.\" Whether they are listened to by the administration is another matter. \"I remember people at Princeton being very unhappy about the war that was about to happen,\" Trigg concedes. \"I didn't mention Iraq in the book because I didn't want to be pinned down to a certain time and place, but it was very much in the back of my mind.\"</p> <p>So, too, were the subsequent goings-on at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and how much the White House knew about them, he says. Torture is an issue on which there can be no compromise in the Trigg world view. Is he then a moral absolutist?</p> <p>\"It's not a term I care for,\" he says, \"but there are issues on which the moral truth is relevant for all time.\" And others, he would argue, where a more relativist stance is acceptable. \"Tolerance, for instance, is an objective virtue worth pursuing in a complex society like ours,\" he says. \"But there is a limit to how far you can respect the views of others.</p> <p>\"What I'm trying to argue in the book is that morality is not just a private matter. It's part of politics and it should underpin the law. Justice is what matters. Fox-hunting is a case in point. You may, like me, think that it is not a desirable pursuit. But whether you have a law banning it comes into the realms of individual liberty. \"</p> <p>Trigg has just embarked on a book, commissioned by Oxford University Press, on the role of religion in public life - a subject on which the prime minister might be rather more articulate.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Morality Matters by Roger Trigg is published by Blackwell at \u00a310.99</p>",
  "<p>A recent experiment in Germany shows that botox can make people's armpits smell better. Botox - aka \"botulinum toxin\" - has had a curious reputation with the public. First it was feared: it can kill, after all. Then it was cheered: the fashionable were delighted to hear that something with a hint of danger could make their wrinkles vanish. Now we are on the verge of a third, and rather different, wave of acclaim.</p> <p>Until not so very long ago, only horror-movie fans, physicians and hypochondriacs were lovingly familiar with the basics about botulinum toxin. Everyone else would hear mention of it only occasionally - whenever a food-borne illness called botulism struck down some unhappy soul. The Centres for Disease Control put out a concise description of the illness and its cause: \"Botulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness caused by a nerve toxin that is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum.\"</p> <p>As all up-to-date celebrity worshippers know, one particular variety of botulinum toxin - called \"botulinum toxin A\" - turned out to be useful in a cosmetically valuable way. Botulinum toxin A has other medical uses, too. One of them, the control of excessive, by-the-bucketful underarm sweating, inspired the notion that botulinum toxin might be useful in combating nasty armpit odour.</p> <p>The notion was put to the test using T-shirts, sniff tests and volunteers who allowed doctors to inject botulinum toxin A into one armpit and a salt solution into the other.</p> <p>The doctors are Marc Heckmann, Bianca Teichmann and Bettina M Pause of Ludwig Maximilian University, in Munich, and Gerd Plewig of Christian Albrecht University, in Kiel.</p> <p>This is specialised research, and discussing it calls for a bit of specialised vocabulary. Bromidrosis is a word familiar to physicians, and to some of the people who suffer from bromidrosis. It is especially familiar to those sufferers who have consulted a physician. Bromidrosis means \"fetid or foul-smelling perspiration\". The word axillary means \"having to do with the armpit\".</p> <p>I mention these two obscure words because Heckmann, Teichmann, Pause and Plewig use them in describing their volunteers. The report says that \"although the volunteers had no history of bromidrosis, the axillary odour was clearly rated as unpleasant prior to treatment\".</p> <p>T-shirt sniff tests were performed before, and again seven days after, the botox-in-the-armpit injections.</p> <p>The results, report the doctors, were dramatic: \"Axillae treated with botulinum toxin A were rated as smelling less unpleasant or literally more pleasant, which means an improvement in the quality of body odour. Presently, any explanation for this can only be highly speculative.\"</p> <p>We see here the birth of a tentative new rule of thumb: what doesn't kill you makes you smoother, and less stinky.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly magazine Annals of Improbable Research (<a href=\"http://www.improbable.com\">www.improbable.com</a>), and organiser of the Ig Nobel Prize</p>",
  "How on earth did we get into this mess? It is difficult for many of us to get very worked up about foxhunting, but it is easy to get worked up about the idiocy that has brought us to where we are now. <p>It was obvious from the start that it would end badly. The loss of proportion is staggering. Whatever progressive politics is about, or worth taking on opposing interests for, it is not about views on alternative methods of pest control. Talk of invoking the Parliament Act is like declaring a state of emergency because of a patch of fog on the M4. </p> <p>I dislike the idea of blood sports. Some of the people who engage in them seem especially unlovely. Unseating the toffocracy is appealing. The trouble comes when we start converting personal prejudices into state action. Not only do we stir up all sorts of unnecessary trouble, we wander into a bog of hypocrisies, inconsistencies and contradictions. </p> <p>Many of my colleagues have a passion for the issue that is in inverse proportion to its significance. Others have allowed themselves to be imprisoned by pressure groups. Some (including Tony Blair and most of the cabinet, I suspect) would just like it to go away. </p> <p>It is the last stand of a kind of gesture politics that Labour has taken much trouble to banish on other fronts. The alarm bells first rang for me a few years ago when a packed meeting of Labour MPs howled down the suggestion of an independent inquiry on the issue. The government did set up an inquiry, but it need not have bothered. Minds were already made up. </p> <p>A similar fate awaited the elaborate hearings conducted by poor Alun Michael. The compromise bill he constructed was dead even before it reached the Commons. It was a triumph for deaf absolutism. </p> <p>Hunting is cruel, but so are the alternatives. That was the Burns report finding. A sensible fox, asked to state a preference between being hunted, shot, snared or gassed, would tick the \"none of the above\" box. A further finding was that, particularly in upland areas, hunting with dogs is an effective way of controlling fox populations. Yet the House of Commons now seriously proposes to criminalise a farmer in the fells who takes out a pack of hounds to hunt the fox that killed his chickens. As Oscar Wilde might have said, this is the unpersuadable in pursuit of the unpoliceable. </p> <p>The fact is that we routinely do unspeakable things to animals; hunting is scarcely up there with our ordinary cruelties. I have just watched a local council pest control officer on television explaining how he kills rats by giving them a poison that stops their blood clotting until they eventually die. I have yet to hear such practices denounced from the Commons benches. If sport is the issue, then why not ban all killing of animals, birds and fish for pleasure? Exchanging substance for symbolism is the worst form of hypocrisy. </p> <p>Nor can it be a matter of political and moral sensibility. Robin Cook opposes a ban, Ann Widdicombe supports one. Hitler famously loved animals, but hated Jews. We should at least try to stick to the merits of the issue and avoid the rival moral frenzies. Instead, we have allowed the fundamentalists (on both sides) to take over, with predictable consequences. When this happens, reason and compromise are the first casualties, and we end up with our own homely version of civil war. </p> <p>It is being waged in the name of democracy. A majority in the elected house has voted emphatically and repeatedly in favour of a total ban. For some, that is the end of the argument. But this is crude majoritarianism, not liberal democracy. That was previously our complaint against the governing style of Margaret Thatcher - pushing half-baked measures through the Commons, refusing all compromise, simply because she had the majority to do so. A mature liberal democracy should always try to find as much common ground as possible, especially on measures that arouse rival passions and where agreement is necessary to make them work. </p> <p>There is no difficulty in constructing a sensible compromise. We could strengthen the laws that outlaw unnecessary animal cruelty, and force hunting to justify itself in relation to them. The Lords would approve it, the hunters would have to put up with it, most people would find it satisfactory, and a small advance for civilisation would have been made. </p> <p>An outbreak of sanity is now needed. It would be a final madness for my parliamentary colleagues to prefer to die in the ditch for an unenforceable ban than to secure an achievable, if partial, victory. Having had a good run, it is time for this issue to go to ground. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Tony Wright is Labour MP for Cannock Chase and chair of the public administration select committee </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:wrightt@parliament.uk\">wrightt@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "Should we use evidence obtained by torture in the name of the misleadingly named \"war on terrorism\"? Two senior British judges say yes, notwithstanding Britain's obligation under the UN convention against torture (Uncat) to \"ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings\". The House of Lords, our highest court, will decide shortly whether the two judges were right. <p>Last August the court of appeal decided by a majority of two to one that the home secretary, David Blunkett, was entitled to rely on information derived from torture as a basis for imprisoning aliens as terrorist suspects, indefinitely and without charge - provided that the torturers were foreign, and had practised the torture abroad, without any encouragement by British authorities. British torture: bad. Foreign torture: OK. </p> <p>One of the two judges in the majority, Lord Justice Laws, declared that he could not believe \"that the law should sensibly impose on the secretary of state a duty of solemn inquiry as to the interrogation methods used by agencies of other sovereign states. Apart from the practical unreality, I can find no sound juridical base for the imposition of such a requirement.\" </p> <p>The judgment prompted surprisingly little public disquiet, or even debate. In a gloating article in the Independent, the home secretary welcomed it. </p> <p>Lord Justice Neuberger, the judge in the minority in the appeal court, took a fundamentally opposite view. He concluded that \"it is not open to Siac [the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, the only court to which those detained as terrorist suspects can appeal] to receive in evidence, or to take into account, a statement sought to be adduced by the secretary of state, if that statement was made under torture\". He went on: \"This applies whether the statement was made by the appellant or a third party, and irrespective of the identity of the torturers.\" </p> <p>In spite of a wealth of expert legal opinion in support of these conclusions, the majority judges disagreed with Neuberger. They were seemingly unimpressed by the obvious fact, quite apart from considerations of international law and morality, that evidence got by torture is inherently unreliable. Most people will eventually say anything to stop being tortured. It's hard to see how the home secretary can make the necessary assessment of the reliability of evidence on which to base a decision to lock up a terrorist suspect without making a \"solemn inquiry\" as to how it was obtained. If it turns out to have been extracted by torture, he ought to dismiss it as manifestly unreliable, unless independently corroborated by more cogent evidence. Common sense dictates that Siac has the same duty. </p> <p>Some argue that the home secretary could not responsibly ignore evidence of a specific terrorist threat against a British target just because the information was derived from torture. But no one suggests that he should. If some wretch in a foreign jail tries to save his remaining fingernails by accusing two foreign nationals living in Burnley of planning to bomb Buckingham Palace on the next anniversary of September 11, there could be no objection in law or common sense to a visit by Special Branch to Burnley for a quick look round and a chat with the pair. If on arrival they find bomb-making equipment, a map of the Mall highlighting the palace in yellow and September 11 ringed on a calendar on the wall, that would obviously be admissible evidence on which to base criminal charges, even if the original tip-off had relied on torture. But that is a far cry from treating the original uncorroborated torture-based tip-off in isolation as a basis for indefinitely jailing them without trial. </p> <p>There were other unwelcome surprises from the judges. Lords Justices Laws and Pill acknowledged that under Uncat, Britain is obliged to \"ensure\" that any statement made as a result of torture is not invoked as evidence. They seem to have accepted that the home secretary could not logically be entitled to rely on information that he would be unable to disclose in court as evidence of the reasonableness of his decisions. But because Uncat has not been incorporated into British domestic law, and because Britain has (inexcusably) not obeyed Uncat's implied injunction to legislate to \"ensure\" that torture- derived evidence is inadmissible \"in any proceedings\", its provisions are not binding on our courts. A barrister representing the detainees sought permission to argue that Uncat was part of customary international law and therefore a British common-law obligation, enforceable by our courts, but the court refused to consider this important argument because it was introduced too late. </p> <p>Is it unreasonable to ask our higher courts to apply ordinary principles of equity and morality to their decisions, and not to rely on a questionable deconstruction of the wording of an international convention in order to arrive at such a counterintuitive conclusion - one that is not only contrary to our sense of right and wrong, but also seriously harmful in the licence it provides for torturers in future? </p> <p>There is another way of looking at the issue. John Greenwell, a former legal adviser to the Australian attorney general's department, doesn't see the problem as whether or not particular evidence should be admissible. Instead, he argues that the home secretary would be acting unlawfully in exercising his power to detain terrorist suspects on the basis of information obtained by torture, because for him to do so would involve Britain condoning crimes against humanity, and also prevent it from complying with its international obligations under the torture convention. This approach echoes Lord Justice Neuberger's minority opinion, but from a different angle. </p> <p>The appeal court's judgment disturbingly recalls that Siac is not bound by the ordinary rules governing the admissibility of evidence. It may admit hearsay evidence, even if it is not independently corroborated. In a case in 2000 the appeal court, later upheld by the House of Lords, ruled that the home secretary is not obliged to prove any specific facts on which he relies to detain a suspect, even to a low level of probability. A general view of the circumstances and reasonable suspicion of possible future behaviour are enough. So when Siac - whose proceedings are the nearest thing to a fair trial that those detained without charge are allowed to have - hears challenges against the home secretary's decisions to detain a foreign national without charge, it cannot exclude evidence because it is hearsay or obtained by torture, nor even require proof of any of the facts adduced against the detainee. </p> <p>The appeal to the House of Lords against the torture judgment should be seen in conjunction with the hearing before nine law lords last week on the legality of the government's opt-out of the provision in the European convention on human rights that bans detention without trial. Without this suspension of the right to liberty, the home secretary's powers to detain people as suspected terrorists, under which 11 foreign nationals are currently locked up without charge or trial, would clearly be contrary to the convention. </p> <p>We don't yet know when the law lords will give their ruling on that point, nor when they intend to hear the argument in the torture appeal. But the facts that have emerged in the two cases demonstrate that in the attempt to balance the need to counter terrorism against the protection of our traditional civil liberties, the scales have tipped too far in the direction of security, with little evidence that recent security measures have achieved results sufficient to justify them. The opt-out case, and the appeal on the issue of torture, give the law lords what is probably the last opportunity to correct that balance by declaring incompatible with human rights illiberal laws and judgments which do little to enhance our security, but threaten the very freedoms they purport to protect. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sir Brian Barder is a former British ambassador and high commissioner, now retired.

  "<p>Royal &amp; SunAlliance yesterday became the latest company to announce plans to cut costs by axing jobs in Britain and transferring work to India. </p> <p>The decision by the insurer to move 1,200 jobs to Bangalore during the next two years prompted the trade union Amicus to call for more training and development for British-based workers. </p> <p>David Fleming, the national officer for Amicus, said: \"This announcement clearly shows that offshoring presents an unprecedented threat to UK jobs and the economy. The government needs to make raising skills a priority. Policies to enable the UK to compete need to be actioned with urgency to reverse employer under investment in training and development which will hamstring the UK service sector if it is allowed to continue.\" </p> <p>RSA has an 11,000-strong workforce in Britain with about 6,500 of them being involved in the type of call centre and customer service work that is being transferred to India. </p> <p>A number of British companies, particularly those involved in financial services, have been transferring work to India's skilled but cheap labour market in recent years. Insurance company Aviva expects to have 7,000 employees in India by 2007 while banking group HSBC expects to move about 4,500 jobs to lower labour cost countries. </p> <p>According to union estimates, some 8,000 jobs cuts have been announced in recent weeks as a result of plans by companies to move work to lower cost centres. </p> <p>RSA does not intend to employ the workers in India directly. It will use the services of consultancy Accenture, which has been advising it on a pilot programme involving some 100 roles. </p> <p>The insurer said the Indian-based workers would handle calls in the same way its current service operates - that is with calls being taken by the first operator who becomes available. The company expects to save \u00a310m a year in costs and said the move to India was not just about cutting costs but also about extending the working day. </p> <p> Duncan Boyle, the chief executive of RSA's UK business, said: \"We work in a very competitive environment and processing some of our work in India will not only help us control costs but will also give us greater operational flexibility.\" </p> <p>RSA is trying to cut the roles through natural turnover and redeployment but has not ruled out making compulsory redundancies. </p> <p>The decision to move jobs to India followed a pilot scheme under which Indian workers joined the workforce in existing RSA centres and some RSA workers were temporarily located in India. </p> <p>Union officials at Amicus would like the industry to copy a scheme set up by Prudential - to head off stiff opposition to a plan to move jobs offshore - under which the insurer helps cover the cost of personal learning and development for staff. While unions warned of a \"very real threat,\" one of the firms which operates call centres in India insisted there was scope for growth in both the UK and In dia. Matthew Vallance, European director of ICICI OneSource, said: \"Estimates suggest the UK will be short of 714,000 workers by 2010, and so outsourcing work to India will help UK businesses to address this shortfall.\" </p> <p>Some 60% of British call centres are said to be expanding.</p>"
