  "Of the last six Labour leaders, two died in office, three resigned soon after election defeats, and only one, Harold Wilson, went at the time of his own choosing, on his own terms. None of them ever did a Tony Blair and announced they would be quitting after another full term in power. He is like an overstaying guest who looks at his watch around 10pm and says, \"gosh, is that the time al ready? Why don't I book a cab for 12.30?\" <p>Not that anyone believes he will last the full four years. He had to claim he'd be a long time leaving if only to keep that frisson of terror all leaders need to evoke. If you can't scare the groundlings, if you can't make them wake up sweating in the middle of the night because you forgot their first name, then you might as well give up and retire straight away to Paddington (as the estate agents don't call it). </p> <p>What he will have created, though, is a twisting maelstrom of ambition. People will say he has fired the starting gun, but it is not quite like that. Westminster will be more like the scene around the bookies between races. The place will be full of knowing men with bits of paper, backs of beer mats, stubby pencils, all mulling over scraps of information, constantly computing the odds. </p> <p>Nothing will be too small to count. When you sprinkle the first tiny flakes of food on top of an aquarium, all the fish swirl up to grab their share. Word zips round the Palace of Westminster as fast as email round the internet. W offended one Labour region by refusing to talk to them. He was seen buying a drink for X, even though they haven't spoken for years. The Sun is about to reveal that Y has a mistress. \"Z was so embarrassing on Question Time, I had to turn off. He looked like a cross between Rod Hull and Emu.\" </p> <p>Even the likes of me will have a minuscule role: \"Did you see what the sketchwriters said about him? Imagine if he did that on the Today programme!\" </p> <p>Groups will coalesce around the main candidates and every MP will have to decide whether to join one. Be in with the winner, and you could make it to the cabinet. But if you've cleaved to a loser, it can harm you badly. Or you might want to keep your counsel, and pledge your vote only when you have worked out the likely winner. But that's risky, because the top jobs will already be spoken for, and in any case what new leader is famous for keeping his word - a word whispered in your ear by a junior monkey, third assistant to the organ grinder? </p> <p>Surprising names will emerge. When Jim Callaghan resigned, I jokily asked one very junior member of the cabinet, someone roughly as likely to become Labour leader as John Redwood is today, if he was going to throw his hat into the ring. I expected a jovial laugh in return, but I didn't get it. \"A number of people have approached me..\" he said, and I realised that some people live trapped in a forest of self-delusion. </p> <p>For Labour MPs, the problems are more complicated than they are for the Tories, who have to persuade an electorate of only 163 to put them on a short list of two, then start touring the shires. Putative Labour leaders need to persuade their colleagues, the party in the country, and the trade unions as well. Watch who hits the rubber chicken circuit (though these days it's as likely to be a curry supper). Who will turn up at union conferences, hinting at an end to oppressive Tory legislation? Or who can be seen with the power-broking general secretaries in a corner of the Cinnamon Club? </p> <p>What will happen when there is a crisis, such as BSE, foot and mouth, or Hatfield? Or, worse, if we have our own 9/ll? An effective and resourceful response could get someone elected; feeble dithering could end their chances forever. Events, parliamentary performances, TV appearances, words muttered in corridors to receptive ears - they will all change the odds, like the lottery balls bashing against each other on Saturday night. </p> <p>Politicians love to tell you that it's values, it's their desire to create a better life for our people, that motivate them. To a real extent that is true. But what they really love is the competition, the political mud-wrestling, the sheer joy of being a combatant and a spectator at the same time. </p> <p>And these days they will be more effective in their campaigning. Friends of Roy Jenkins used to tell him that if he ever hoped to be Labour leader, he would need to woo the more obscure, less intellectually gifted MPs. After all, they each had as many votes as Tony Crosland or Shirley Williams. He was urged to buy a few of them a drink. </p> <p>Which he did, for one bemused Welsh mining MP. This chap, who had never even met Jenkins, was asked what he wanted, served a pint of Fed, then told by the great man: \"I wish I could join you, but unfortunately I have an urgent meeting ... \"</p>",
  "As soon as the winning candidate's acceptance speech became drowned out by a thunder of abuse, it was clear that this bitterly fought byelection was not going to end quietly. When Ronnie Carroll, a music hall crooner and independent candidate (45 votes; finished 13th of 14), chose to sing Danny Boy rather than make a speech, a charged atmosphere slipped into the anarchically surreal. <p>Rumours swept the hall that the Fathers4Justice supporters in Superman suits were planning to storm the podium. Police and security closed in. But the stunt, when it came, was as predictable as it was shocking - a purple powder bomb flung at Jody Dunn, by the Fathers4Justice candidate, Paul Watson. </p> <p>The Lib Dem candidate struggled to continue with her speech, but it was lost in the heckles, and she was led from the podium in tears. In the stunned hiatus, Mr Watson was allowed to deliver his speech, before being arrested and led away. When Ms Dunn, a family law barrister who believes she may have represented the ex-wife of a Fathers4Justice activist, returned to give interviews in the press gallery, police had to block the stairwells to prevent the cartoon superheroes pursuing her. </p> <p>But by yesterday morning attention had shifted to the night's more enduring shock. The Tories had become the first official opposition party since the second world war to come fourth in a byelection. </p> <p>\"Tactical voting, without a doubt,\" was the line coming out of their campaign HQ. \"People had identified the Lib Dems early on as the party to get rid of Labour.\" </p> <p>But the party workers heading off to Bournemouth know it will not be so easily explained away at conference. Iain Duncan Smith was deposed following the Brent East byelection last year, when the Tory vote fell by 3%. On Thursday, the drop was 11%. </p> <p>The Lib Dems were not hiding their disappointment, for they had genuinely believed they could win. </p> <p>Lord Rennard, the party chief executive, was still dispensing optimism - they had narrowed the majority to about 2,000 from 17,000 - but the \"real victory\" of the night was the collapse of the Tory vote. </p> <p>The narrowness of Labour's victory tempered celebrations but they were ecstatic at the Tories' fourth place. \"The result is a disaster for Michael Howard,\" Iain Wright rejoiced in his acceptance speech.</p>",
  "More than 60,000 students returned to Leeds this week to discover a vast social experiment which aims to limit their \"takeover\" of scores of streets around the two universities. <p>Four square miles will become an exclusion zone for new student hostels and any further conversions of houses into student flats, if a planning inspector approves a package drawn up by the city council. </p> <p>The initiative is by far the largest attempt of its kind to tackle a growing national problem, caused by unprecedented, government-driven increases in the number of students, with little or no extra funding for housing them. </p> <p>Three areas of Leeds - Headingley, Burley and Hyde Park - have students forming more than half the population, creating lop-sided communities with knock-on effects on facilities such as schools. </p> <p>\"There is no personal animosity against students involved in this,\" said Richard Tyler, a retired academic who has campaigned for eight years to create a more mixed community on the hillsides of largely Victorian terraces overlooking the centre. </p> <p>\"Our problem isn't noise, litter or crime but a very large, very transient part of the population which isn't - hasn't the time to be - interested in the area where it lives.\" </p> <p>The evidence shows all over the wedge-shaped corridor north of the universities, which was described in an academic study five years ago as \"a student Shangri-la\". </p> <p>Buzzing with street life, the three inner suburbs also have miles of unkempt gardens and hedges round houses which fill and empty as the annual procession of tenants hurries through. </p> <p>\"Their life's elsewhere, inevitably,\" said Pauline Elliott, a retired school secretary who was born in Burley and has lived in the same street in Hyde Park for 43 years. \"They have such a huge big club in the shape of the universities, where they work and enjoy themselves. </p> <p>\"We're not fuddy-duddies objecting to young people having fun, but it means there aren't the families, the children, the fantastic community that there used to be.\" </p> <p>The problem has caused similar concern in Birmingham and Nottingham, and two conferences are planned this autumn in London and Leeds to brainstorm possible solutions and flag up the issue to government departments. </p> <p>Leeds has decided to press head with the country's first Ashore - area of student housing restraint - to test whether social engineering can have any effect. </p> <p>\"The big problem has been the market,\" said Dr Tyler, who took the drastic step of buying his neighbour's house seven years ago to let it to non-students as a way of keeping the community mixed. </p> <p>\"Landlords and student parents [who buy houses, let them to their children and friends and sell them on graduation] now outbid all other potential buyers. Perhaps the only weapon against them is this kind of planning restraint.\" </p> <p>Powers to exclude particular groups are highly unusual under planning law. But the exclusion zone has crucial backing in principle from the universities, which accept the virtues of spreading student housing more widely. </p> <p>\"Students bring a great many benefits to Leeds as a whole,\" said a spokeswoman for Leeds University. \"They provide a vibrant, cosmopolitan and multicultured environment. </p> <p>\"They regenerate parts of the city. They have obvious financial benefits. But we accept that some residential areas now have an imbalance between permanent and 'transient' residents, and that this has had detrimental effects.\" </p> <p>The university, along with its counterpart, Leeds Metropolitan, has been part of the consultative process leading to the scheme, although both made objections to details at public hearings last month. </p> <p>In particular, they are pressing for restrictions to cover all houses in multiple occupation, not just students, to avoid discrimination and ill-feeling. </p> <p>Students also accept the need for change, although with caveats that shoddy landlords are a more important target. Tom Wong, communications officer for Leeds University union, said: \"We're broadly supportive of Ashore but students must get a better deal on housing all round. It's about time everyone got together to ask the question: where are all the students going to live? </p> <p>\"The government is driving up the numbers and saying 'Don't worry, we'll organise your education.' But they don't seem to have thought about how we're going to be housed.\" </p> <p>Leeds city council, which changed in June from Labour to a Liberal Democrat/Conservative/Green coalition, has been thinking. </p> <p>Apart from Ashore, its strategy is to create Shangri-las at other points of the compass. Both Unipol, the universities' respected housing agency, and private developers have built or converted clusters of new student-only flats to the west and south of the city centre. </p> <p>These include brightly-coloured, angle-roofed blocks close to the lively central pedestrian precinct and a major site in Holbeck, where dereliction is gradually being turned into Leeds's new cultural quarter for media and arts businesses, plus cafes and clubs. But pioneering south of the River Aire, miles from the legendary Skyrack and Original Oak pubs in Headingley, is still seen as a tall order. </p> <p>\"Would the leader of the council, or lobbyists in Headingley, want their 18-year-old daughter to live in the new Holbeck 'student village', in a potentially dangerous area, with inadequate transport links and poor services? Perhaps not,\" said Tom Wong. </p> <p>Dr Tyler counters: \"The proof of this issue was clear at the Ashore planning inquiry. If students got together they could win all three council seats in Headingley ward. But they were the only interest group which didn't turn up to have their say.\" </p> <p> <b>'It's friendly, it just needs to be more mixed'</b></p> <p>Brian and Pauline Elliott were delighted when their new student neighbours moved in this week. It's been hit or miss over the past 10 years whether there'd be any sense of having real people next door, and this year it seems to be hit. </p> <p>\"We said hope you like it and this lad said, 'Great to be here and if there's ever anything we can do for you, just tell us',\" said Brian. \"That's great.\" </p> <p>But however well things go this year in Brudenell Road, where the Elliott's flower garden contrasts with mattresses dumped in a classic absentee landlord's student house two doors up, it is never going to be like a normal street. The contrast is specially strong for the Elliotts because they grew up here, playing cricket in the alley. </p> <p>\"Jimmy Love that played for Yorkshire was one of us - people always used to say what a straight bat he had and I can tell you why. There were two gardens, one each side, where they'd never give your ball back if you hit it over the fence. So that counted as being out and Jim was brilliant at avoiding them.\" </p> <p>The Elliotts might have moved out 15 years ago, when the big demographic change began, but they're glad they've stayed, and they are enjoying campaigning for a mixed community. </p> <p>\"It's the only thing we need,\" said Brian, whose old primary school, Royal Park, has closed because of a lack of local children. \"It's friendly here, lively and we're near the city centre. It just needs to be more mixed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Kerry Conran's Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a retro-SF adventure yarn of a sub- Indiana Jones sort, in which virtually everything we see, except for the actors, has been digitally created. With relish, but without much irony, it begins in 1939 Manhattan where a Zeppelin is moored atop the Empire State Building, The Wizard of Oz is playing at Radio City Music Hall, and a mad German called Totenkopf (played by a hologram version of Laurence Olivier) has embarked upon the destruction of the world, launching an attack against New York using giant iron birds and robots. </p> <p>Only Polly Perkins, ace reporter on the New York Chronicle (Gwyneth Paltrow) and her boyfriend, intrepid British aviator, Sky Captain (Jude Law), can save us. Faced with this mind-boggling threat, the pair go monde-Biggling around the globe in his amphibious fighter plane, taking in Shangri-La and other spots. The designs come from Things to Come, King Kong, the lurid artwork of pulp science-fiction magazines of the 1930s, as well as B-feature space serials. It's technically brilliant, but as far as I'm concerned the Buck Rogers stops here.</p>",
  "<p>Stephen Hopkins's The Life and Death of Peter Sellers is a largely unfunny film about a very funny man. The only really laugh-out-loud sequence comes on a plane trip to Rome, during which Sellers (Geoffrey Rush) decides on his interpretation of Inspector Clouseau and proceeds to inflict it on a stewardess and fellow passengers. The film follows Sellers from his radio stardom with The Goons in the early 50s (staggeringly unfunny) up to his penultimate screen appearance in Being There, a portrait of a man with no real identity, which he regarded as the peak of his career. </p> <p>Presented as a victim of an overbearing mother constantly condemning her husband as a failure, Sellers comes over as an egotistical child, wilful, self-deceiving, and only real when engaged in impersonation. The film's central device is to have Sellers looking at this film of his life. Between takes during its shooting, he assumes the roles of his first wife, his mother, father, Stanley Kubrick and Blake Edwards, rewriting their scripts to present himself in a better light. </p> <p>In addition, Rush also plays Sellers in brief extracts from some of his most famous pictures - the young crook in The Ladykillers, the duchess in The Mouse That Roared, Dr Strangelove, US President Muffly, Clouseau and others. His performance is a tour de force in an otherwise negligible, pompous picture that casts no fresh light on Sellers or his times. </p> <p>San Francisco-based heavy metal band Metallica formed in 1981, have sold millions of albums and were once nicknamed 'Alcoholica' for the booze and drugs they downed. Two of the founders are still there, one was kicked out, one was killed in a road accident on tour in Sweden and one left to do his own thing in 2001.</p>",
  "The white dot of a large property, buried in woodland near Ower, draws the eye down the ride between Linwood Copse and the King's Garn Inclosure across miles of hidden countryside. The ride begins on the wartime airfield of Stoney Cross, where tiny white puffballs decorate a broad circle in the turf. Blackberries are still ripening on the bushes, with brilliant red rose hips dotted among them. Over them hangs a heavy crop of crab apples, and berried hollies promise a colourful show. <p>Down the ride, hidden for the most part, devilsbit scabious peep out from the margins of the bracken. Here it seems not to like the open spaces very much but, across the King's Garn Gutter, it grows happily on the open golf course fairways. </p> <p>Towards the bottom of the ride is one of several pounds dotted around the forest. The ponies in each area are rounded up in the autumn for a health check and to brand the foals. Their tails are cut in distinctive ways to show that the owner has paid the fee for exercising the right to depasture them on the open forest. One of the posts bears the brand marks of the commoners using this pound. The embers of the small log fire used to heat the branding irons is evidence that this year's drift has already taken place.</p>",
  "<p>Swedish retailer Ikea racked up record UK sales of more than \u00a31bn over the past year as customers snapped up its flat-pack furniture. </p> <p>Like-for-like sales were up 11% at the group, which has managed to escape the gloom in the British furniture market that has seen troubled rivals MFI and Courts issue profits warnings in recent weeks. </p> <p>Peter Hogsted, head of the retailer's British division, said sales had soared 15% to more than \u00a31bn in the year to August 31. </p> <p>He put the success down to better customer service, longer operating hours and the decision earlier this year to give store managers more control over the way outlets were run. </p> <p>Mr Hogsted said Ikea was taking market share. \"The competition is shifting, DIY businesses are growing stronger,\" he said. </p> <p>He also said there had been no customer backlash after a decision to introduce a 70p levy on credit card transactions.</p>",
  "The forthcoming report by eminent ecclesiastics, chaired by Archbishop Robin Eames, Primate of All Ireland, is guaranteed an urgent readership. <p>Intended to address the manner in which the Anglican church is governed and has communion, it arises from the controversy surrounding the consecration of the openly gay Bishop of New Hampshire, Gene Robinson, and the threatened schism of some parts of the church, notably the self-described \"global south\". This largely excludes New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, all of which, I was taught, are in the south. Whatever the report says, the language matters. </p> <p>Is it possible to commit schism? Or is schism something that happens to you? Are not those threatening schism actually sectarian, and breaking away of their own volition? Robinson's consecration was within American canon law, and followed a valid electoral process. Those threatening schism are largely outside the US, attempting to impose their views upon it; opponents within the US are refusing democracy in a country that makes such a noise about democracy worldwide. </p> <p>Robinson's opponents would not want to be called sectarian because they claim the higher moral ground. For them, it is important to propagate the idea that they are the mother organisation, and their calls for discipline and sanctions are a matter of preservation and purity. </p> <p>The recent history of the Anglican communion is a linguistic battleground; words have been hijacked to mean what their users wish them to mean. The organisation Reform, for example, has a title resonant of forward-looking change, but was founded to resist change. The word \"reform\" reverberates with the English Reformation, the foundation of Ecclesia Anglicana, a settlement marked by a balanced use of scripture, reason and tradition, whereas the modern \"reform\" appeals almost exclusively to its particular narrow reading of scripture. </p> <p>Ironically, it is secularisation within an organisation that would lament secular dilution of Christian faith in society. This dissembling is adopted against the openness of people like Gene Robinson - or my former colleague Canon (now Dean) Jeffrey John - whose offence against what their opponents would call \"orthodoxy\" was to adhere to the ancient Christian virtue of truthfulness in all things. Reform and Forward in Faith both originated as resistance to the ordination of women, a forward-moving reform that overturned a 400-year exclusion. Now there's a contradiction. </p> <p>Perhaps most seriously kidnapped of all have been the words \"biblical\", \"orthodox\", \"traditional\" and \"scriptural\", all much beloved of people whom many might call \"fundamentalist\". Herein, of course, lies the rub. </p> <p>\"Fundamentals\" was first used in the US in the 1920s to describe a desire for clarity with regard to the fundamentals of religious life. Though then describing almost exclusively Christians, it became common currency when applied to the interpretation of Islam by Ayatollah Khomeini, shifted to strictly orthodox Jews and is now a term of abuse in relation to the Taliban and the insurgency in Iraq. It has developed from literal understanding of scripture to extreme action, intolerance (though scripture in all three faiths espouses the opposite) and self-righteous judgmentalism. </p> <p>In the same period, \"cleric\" has become a boo word with violent overtones, \"biblical\" now means an interpretation that is narrowly literal, and \"traditionalists\" oppose change from a date they select - misunderstanding Cardinal Newman's point that \"to live is to change, and to become perfect is to change often\". </p> <p>We all adopt words as shorthand, which is probably laziness more than anything else, so none of us is innocent. But we have come to the point where our linguistic usage is encoded, language has been kidnapped and hybridised such that truthful debate is impossible. The labelling on the packet endangers the Anglican church's inheritance of tolerance and breadth, and its mission - to seek after truth and find it - risks being wasted. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Very Rev Colin Slee is Dean of Southwark</p>",
  "The first head-to-head clash between George Bush and John Kerry left America's crucial constituency of undecided voters broadly agreeing that the Democrat had won - but still far from unanimous that they wanted him as president. <p>In swing states across the country yesterday, voters who have yet to make up their minds told the Guardian that President Bush's long pauses and irritated facial expressions had contrasted poorly with his opponent's poise. Some, however, said they still found Mr Kerry unclear when it came to his views on Iraq. </p> <p>\"Kerry won,\" conceded James Scalzo, 61, a retired defence contractor from Michigan and a registered Republican who voted for Mr Bush in 2000. \"It was a question of style. He came across as more relaxed, more in control - Bush seemed a little agitated; a little nervous. But I'm really not too enthused by either candidate. I guess I still dislike Kerry more than I do Bush.\" </p> <p>As Democratic campaigners hurried to prepare material to exploit footage of the president's reactions, Sharon Trenoweth, a registered independent from New Hampshire, felt she had seen those facial expressions somewhere before. \"You know when you're little and your dad says, 'Do it because I said so.' [Bush] was like that: 'I know what I'm talking about, I'm the boss, and that's that.'\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry might have seemed aloof, \"but we don't necessarily have to have a buddy. We want someone who's intelligent. Kerry didn't get me excited before, and he still doesn't, but now I think he's the best option,\" said Ms Trenoweth, who used to work in the defence industry and now paints New England folk art for a living. </p> <p>She was glued to the debate \"like the Superbowl\", she said. The sporting comparison was reflected in the deluge of instant post-match analysis. </p> <p>A CNN survey of viewers found that 57% felt Mr Kerry performed better, with 37% favouring Mr Bush. But while 60% thought the Democrat expressed himself more clearly - a blow for Republican efforts to portray him as a \"flip-flopper\" - 54% still felt the incumbent would be the tougher leader if re-elected. </p> <p>In Miami, where the debate took place on Thursday night, Nory Acosta, 24, a law student, was one of many undecideds who preferred Mr Kerry's style but remained in the Bush camp on the Iraq issue. \"Maybe his answers didn't come as quickly as they might have come, but I think at this point there really isn't much choice but to carry on - otherwise it might pose a problem in terms of the impression in the rest of the world,\" she said. </p> <p>Her concern for projecting a consistent international image mirrored a point Mr Bush made repeatedly in the debate. \"I know we're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens,\" he said. </p> <p>But the president also found support among swing voters who thought the rest of the world's views should not matter. \"George W Bush is the president of the United States, and to me, the United States should come first, rather than the world,\" said Vaughn Hoovler, 36, the owner of a metal-pressing company in Mansfield, Ohio, and a rare example of an undecided voter who called the debate for the president. </p> <p>\"I thought George did a wonderful job,\" said Mr Hoovler. \"I was confident he knew where he was at, and what he had to do to move forward. Yeah, he looked angry, but he was clear and to the point.\" </p> <p>However, Mr Kerry's insistence on taking an internationalist approach to US foreign policy found widespread support, even among those leaning towards Mr Bush. \"He vacillates back and forth [on Iraq], but I think he's right in that regard,\" said Mr Scalzo, while Ms Acosta - though declaring herself more sympathetic to the incumbent - said she \"did actually agree with Kerry on that point\". </p> <p>In the debate, Mr Kerry had condemned Mr Bush for failing even to hold \"the kind of statesmanlike summits that pull people together ... In fact, he's done the opposite - he pushed them away\". </p> <p>Mr Kerry's task will be to turn the good impression he left on Thursday night into a conviction on the part of undecided voters that his specific policy proposals are superior. For Therese Safford, an employee of the Great Lakes Tribal Council in Wisconsin, he seemed to be well on the way. \"Kerry sounds like he has a plan. I'm sure the president has a plan, too,\" she added, wryly, \"but he didn't seem to know what the plan was\". The Iraq war only took place, she suspected, \"because he felt he needed to finish the unfinished business left by his father.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush's curious use of language drew mockery from one influential corner of cable television, the Daily Show on Comedy Central, which is watched by many young adults. The president's assertion that \"we are facing a group of folks who have such hatred in their hearts, they'll strike anywhere\" made al-Qaida sound more like a harmless gathering of diners at an Italian restaurant, observed the presenter Jon Stewart. </p> <p>\"We're facing a group of folks? A group of folks is what you run into at the Olive Garden,\" he said.</p>",
  "Chile's inland revenue service has filed a tax fraud complaint against the former dictator Augusto Pinochet after investigating multimillion-dollar offshore bank accounts that came to light in July. <p>Gen Pinochet's financial adviser, Oscar Aiken, was also named in the tax agency's complaint, announced yesterday. Details were not made public, but a spokesman said it was related to the law against making incomplete or false tax declarations. </p> <p>The 88-year-old retired general, notorious for human rights abuses during his rule from 1973 to 1990, was widely believed to have been honest in handling public monies until a financial scandal broke in July. </p> <p>Judge Sergio Munoz was assigned to investigate Gen Pinochet's finances after a US Senate committee found that the Washington-based Riggs Bank had held up to $8m from 1994 to 2002 in secret accounts for the former dictator. </p> <p>Judge Munoz asked tax, banking and securities agencies to look into the funds. The tax agency said yesterday that it was now up to the judge to decide the next steps, such as whether to bring formal charges against Gen Pinochet. </p> <p>The US Senate report said Riggs took pains to hide the money for the former ruler, especially during the late 1990s when a Spanish judge issued an international arrest warrant for him on human rights charges and tried to freeze his assets. </p> <p>Critics have said Gen Pinochet's tax filings, which are on public record, did not reflect the assets in the accounts. His family and financial advisers have said the money came from legitimate sources, including donations from supporters and wise investments. </p> <p>The former dictator is also the defendant in hundreds of human rights cases stemming from torture, assassinations and kidnappings by his secret police. </p> <p>One of those cases reached a crucial point recently when Chile's supreme court stripped him of his immunity from prosecution, giving the green light to an investigating judge to indict him for responsibility in the disappearances and deaths of 24 Chilean leftists in other South American countries during the 1970s. </p> <p>On Thursday, three court-appointed doctors examined Gen Pinochet to determine whether he was mentally fit to stand trial in the case. The results of these tests are to be released by next Friday.</p>",
  "In his vicarage overlooking the beet fields and pastures that stretch past the Church of Santiago de Sancobad, Father Antonio Seijas had clear opinions on Spain's socialist government as it prepared yesterday to introduce gay marriage. <p>\"This government is disgraceful, pornographic,\" said Father Seijas, a parish priest in this small, traditional country town in the north-western region of Galicia. \"It is not just Catholic values that are being destroyed, but human ones.\" </p> <p>The elderly Father Seijas, \"Don Antonio\" to his parishioners, is, however, increasingly alone in his beliefs, even in Vilalba, one of Spain's most conservative and Catholic areas. </p> <p>Prime minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero's socialist cabinet yesterday approved a draft law that will make Spain the third country in Europe, after Holland and Belgium, to have gay marriage. </p> <p>\"Our constitution guarantees the right to marriage ... We're going to extend that right to people who historically have been discriminated against: homosexuals,\" said the justice minister, Juan Fernando L\u00f3pez Aguilar. </p> <p>It was a sign that Spain is moving rapidly away from the church-established mores that ruled the countryside when Don Antonio was born here 75 years ago. </p> <p>But it puts Mr Zapatero on a collision course with a Spanish church that is currently led by another son of Vilalba, Cardinal Antonio Mar\u00eda Rouco Varela. \"We will end up with systematic destruction [of the family], of the basic cell of society,\" the cardinal warned in one of several broadsides against Mr Zapatero recently. </p> <p>Mr Zapatero has been denounced as anti-religious, while a spokesman for the Spanish Bishop's Conference this week claimed that introducing gay marriage was like \"imposing a virus on society\". </p> <p>Church authorities have even encouraged Spaniards to take to the streets to protest against this and other proposed measures, which include downgrading religious education in schools and easing restrictions on divorce and abortion. </p> <p>Until recently these sentiments were echoed by the conservative People's party, which was ousted from power nationally in March elections but maintains control of Galicia's semi-autonomous government through the regional leader, Manuel Fraga. </p> <p>Mr Fraga, a former minister in General Franco's dictatorship and founder of the People's party, is also from Vilalba. A bust of the 81-year-old veteran has stood in front of the town hall for the past 34 years. </p> <p>In recent years Mr Fraga has labelled as \"vandals\" and \"anarchists\" those who want to introduce gay marriage or give rights to unmarried cohabiting couples. \"Some are seeking to destroy the family,\" he warned during his last election campaign. </p> <p>But the People's party, seeing a high general level of acceptance for gay marriage among Spaniards, has done a rapid U-turn. This week it announced that it backed a form of civil union for homosexual couples that would, however, exclude both the description \"marriage\" and the right to adopt children. </p> <p>In Vilalba, the People's party deputy mayor, Gerardo Criado, claimed that, despite the town's conservative, Catholic reputation, few people would be scandalised if a gay couple here suddenly got married: \"People may be traditional, but they are not necessarily that conservative. Different sexual expressions have always existed in the countryside and people have always known that.\" </p> <p>Opinion polls, including one that shows gay marriage has wider acceptance in Spain than in traditionally liberal Sweden, indicate that is true for the rest of the country, too. Xos\u00e9 Manuel Irimia, an opposition town councillor for the left-leaning Galician Nationalist Block agrees. \"One thing is what the church tells people to do, and another is what people actually do,\" he said. </p> <p>But it still proved impossible to find anyone in Vilalba who was openly gay. With a population of 15,000, its streets are dotted with granite crosses and signs pointing pilgrims along the Way of St James to nearby Santiago de Compostela. </p> <p>\"I know people who are gay here, but none of them have come out of the closet and that is a decision I have to respect, though it would make no difference to me if they did,\" said Mr Irimia. </p> <p>To find a gay campaigner in these parts you have to migrate to the big cities. In Santiago de Compostela, Carlos Valcarcel, spokesman for a local gay activists' group, said: \"This means a lot to us. For the first time we are being treated as equal citizens.\" </p> <p>He, too, thought Spaniards would find homosexual marriage easy to accept. \"It already seems to me that we are less apart from the rest of society than gays in countries like Britain,\" he said. \"You don't find gay ghettoes here.\" </p> <p>Mr Zapatero's upcoming raft of social legislation is the most obvious sign that he wants to bring change to Spain. </p> <p>Withdrawing Spanish troops from Iraq, which he ordered immediately on taking office, has been a popular measure, with opinion polls showing wide backing. But opponents accuse Mr Zapatero of being little more than a winning smile with a be-nice-to-people attitude that will not stand the strains of being in power. </p> <p>\"That image is purely cosmetic and the laws he is bringing in are not, really, going to make that much difference to people,\" said Mr Criado. </p> <p>That is certainly not how Spain's homosexuals were feeling yesterday. \"I did not vote for Zapatero, but I believe in him and I will defend him,\" said Mr Valcarcel.</p>",
  "<b> Move while she can</b> <p>While your mother is fit and able enough to face the change, help her to move to a small, ground floor flat. Take into consideration closeness to shops, nearby public transport, a small garden to sit out in, somewhere for her to hang out her washing, level terrain around and so on.

They were fit enough at that point to cope with the move and it released money so they could spoil themselves a little as well as the grandchildren.

However, although your mother might be sprightly, it is unlikely that she is going to able to maintain a large house for any length of time. Consequently, she might consider \"trading down\". This would ensure that funds are released and, additionally, she does not have the worry of upkeep. She might also consider retirement flat complexes.

  "A British man held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay has alleged that he saw US soldiers kill two men in Afghanistan. <p>Moazzam Begg, 36, who has been detained for 2 years without charge or trial, complains in the first letter from a serving inmate to describe severe mistreatment of having suffered \"vindictive torture\" and death threats, and implies that he has made a false confession. </p> <p>His lawyers said yesterday that they believed he had been held in solitary confinement at the US military base in Cuba because he had seen the killing. He has had no contact with fellow prisoners since his arrival almost 600 days ago. </p> <p>Although former detainees have alleged that they suffered extensive abuse and torture at Bagram in Afghanistan and Guant\u00e1namo, mail from the camp is heavily censored. </p> <p>It is unclear why the Pentagon has cleared a document which makes such strong allegations of abuse. </p> <p>Mr Begg's letter, which is labelled as a supplement to an earlier statement, was written in July and forwarded to his legal team earlier this week. He wrote it after learning that he would be given access to a lawyer. </p> <p>The American lawyer who subsequently visited him could be jailed if she disclosed their discussions. </p> <p>In his letter Mr Begg, who comes from Birmingham, said that he was a law-abiding Briton who had never met Osama bin Laden or joined al-Qaida or other paramilitary organisations. </p> <p>He was arrested by Pakistani agents at his home in Islamabad and handed over to the Americans, who held him at Bagram in Afghanistan for a year and transferred him to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in February last year. </p> <p>Mr Begg wrote: \"During several interviews, particularly - though unexclusively - in Afghanistan, I was subjected to pernicious threats of torture, actual vindictive torture and death threats - amongst other coercively employed interrogation techniques.\" </p> <p>He described signing a statement in early February 2003 \"under threats of long-term imprisonment, summary trials and execution\", and added: \"Interviews were conducted in an environment of generated fear, resonant with terrifying screams of fellow detainees facing similar methods ... </p> <p>\"This culminated ... with the deaths of two fellow detainees at the hands of US military personnel, to which I myself was partially witness.\" </p> <p>Two deaths at Bagram airbase have been classified as homicides and the autopsies indicated \"blunt-force injuries\", but it is thought that Mr Begg is referring to separate incidents. </p> <p>The Pentagon said torture was prohibited at Guant\u00e1 namo Bay and that all \"credible allegations\" of abuse were investigated, but would not elaborate on whether it considered Mr Begg's claims to be \"credible\". </p> <p>It added: \"The United States operates a safe, humane and professional detention operation at Guant\u00e1namo that is providing valuable information in the war on terror.\" </p> <p>Mr Begg said he had not been allowed to see a chaplain or a lawyer, and that even letters from his eight-year-old child were censored. </p> <p>Clive Stafford Smith, one of Mr Begg's lawyers in the US, said: \"It turns out he is a witness to the two homicides at Bagram. There is no other reason to keep him separate from the others.\" </p> <p>He called on the American government to declassify evidence of the deaths, and said he would file a legal demand on Monday to end the \"inhumane treatment\" immediately. </p> <p>He called on the British government to demand Mr Begg's immediate repatriation. </p> <p>Gareth Peirce, Mr Begg's solicitor, said: \"We are requesting that the UK government immediately takes this evidence of torture to the United Nations demanding that the USA is held responsible.\" </p> <p>Lawyers have begun a battery of legal actions on behalf of Guant\u00e1namo detainees and the authorities may have felt under pressure to disclose documents. </p> <p>\"The letter has either been let through by mistake or because someone in the US has a conscience,\" Mr Stafford-Smith said. </p> <p>Ms Peirce said she believed it could be \"the 100th such letter he has written\" and described it as a cry for help. She said it was intolerable that evidence from Guant\u00e1namo could be used to justify the continued detention of foreign nationals in the UK under anti-terror laws. </p> <p>Mr Begg's father Azmat said it was heartbreaking to read the letter, but added: \"I am surprised and proud that he has been held for three years and yet is still strong.\" </p> <p>He said he believed that after his son saw the deaths in Afghanistan, US soldiers put a gun to his head and said: \"Now it's you.\" </p> <p>William Hopkins, a consultant psychiatrist for the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, said anyone held in the conditions described could suffer a wide range of problems, including depression, paranoia, hallucinations and suicidal thoughts. </p> <p>The Foreign Office said that the government was continuing to press for the remaining Britons to be repatriated and had raised the concerns expressed by the detainees with the US authorities. </p> <p>It said: \"During welfare visits, Mr Begg has never alleged to us that he has been systematically abused at Guant\u00e1namo Bay in the way that is being suggested. </p> <p>\"Mr Begg has said that he was mistreated at Bagram and we have raised this with the American authorities who are investigating. We take all allegations of abuse of British nationals abroad seriously.\" </p> <p>In recent months the British government appears to have been stepping up pressure on the US to release its citizens. </p> <p>Three other Britons - Feroz Abbasi, Martin Mubanga and Richard Belmar - and several British residents are among more than 600 men still held at Guant\u00e1namo. Five other Britons gave harrowing accounts of life in US custody after being released without charge earlier this year. </p> <p>In a report first published by the Guardian, three of them detailed repeated beating, humiliation and death threats.</p> <p><b>Extracts</b></p> <p>Moazzam Begg's letter is dated July 12 2004, and addressed to the military command at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. He requests that it be copied to his lawyers and US and British authorities. </p> <p>\"After over two and a half years in the custody of the US military without charge and, by extension, without jurisdiction, I have yet to be afforded basic rights normally granted under the constitution of the US and international law. I therefore demand ... that I be released immediately and returned to my family. </p> <p>I expect logical and reasonable answers for the following violations and abuses: The exact purpose of my abduction, kidnapping and false imprisonment on 31st January 2002 ... Why I was physically abused and stripped by force, then paraded in front of several cameras ... The exact purpose for my incarceration in solitary confinement since 8th Feb, 2003.</p> <p>Any documents presented to me by US law enforcement agents were signed and initialled under duress ... During several interviews, particularly in Afghanistan, I was subjected to ... vindictive torture and death threats. </p> <p>The said interviews were conducted in an environment of generated fear, resonant with terrifying screams of fellow detainees facing similar methods. In this atmosphere ... was the compounded use of racially and religiously prejudiced taunts. This culminated, in my opinion, with the deaths of two fellow detainees at the hands of US military personnel, to which I myself was partially witness. </p> <p>I have maintained a compliant and amicable manner with my captors. </p> <p>I am a law-abiding citizen of the UK and attest vehemently to my innocence before God and the law of any crime - though none has ever been alleged. I have neither ever met Osama bin Laden, nor been a member of al-Qaida - or any synonymous paramilitary organisation, party or group. </p> <p>Neither have I engaged in hostile acts against the USA, nor assisted such groups in the same. I reiterate my intention to seek justice at every possible level available.\"</p>",
  "A rare Middle Eastern incantation bowl - which is buried underneath houses to ward off evil spirits - has been handed in to Scotland Yard for return to the region. <p>A London art dealer, whom police refused to identify, brought in the item, which he had purchased in Jordan some years ago. It may have come from Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Syria or Israel, where it was common to place bowls upside down in the foundations of new homes. </p> <p>It is now illegal to bring into the UK any artefact which may have been stolen from Iraq since 1990. But as the law is retrospective, and the dealer handed it to police as soon as he became aware of its possible origin, he has not been charged with any offence. </p> <p>Detective Superintendent Vernon Rapley, head of the Metropolitan police's arts and antiques unit, said: \"It's our job to protect the London art market from the illegal importation of stolen property and facilitate its return to its rightful owners, wherever they are in the world.\" </p> <p>The incantation bowl comes from early Christian times and is inscribed in Aramaic, with invocations to protect the householder and their family against evil. </p> <p>There are only about 2,000 incantation bowls registered as archaelogical relics, but Mr Rapley said there were probably tens of thousands for sale around the world. </p> <p>It could have been bought for the equivalent of a few pounds in Iraq, but might have fetched up to \u00a31,000 from a collector in the western world.</p>",
  "<b>Camp statues get a club scene</b> <p>Imagine yourself a God-fearing country boy, come to London to seek his fortune - as Matt Haynes did in issue four of <b> Smoke: A London Peculiar</b> - and then wonder how you would react on coming across London's campest statues, at the church of St Dunstan's-in-the-West. </p> <p>\"From St Dunstan's eastern wall an antique clock projects across the pavement and, lurking behind it in a private pedimented niche which, you can't help feeling, they'd prefer to be upholstered in leather and velvet, not plaster, stone and a bit of netting, two musclemen stand clad in nothing but loincloths and off-the-shoulder lurex. With hand on hip and great knobbly club held firmly erect, each stands upon his one small dais, letting the camera love him, while down below, as you gaze slack-jawed at their rippling six-packs, glistening chests and bulging thighs, you're startled by a strange stirring ... and realise - with some relief - that one of the large iron bells suspended between them has begun to sound. And then you see the cause: the nearest figure has drawn back his club and limply smitten the rusty casing. Ding. And now his partner joins in with a listless dong. They repeat the actions and the hint of a tune disturbs the air.\" </p> <p><b> Age should not wither us</b><br> </p> <p> Poverty among the old is widespread, wrote Simon Smith at the Canadian website <b> <a href=\"http://www.Betterhumans.com\">Betterhumans.com</a></b>. The way to fight the problem, however, is not through anti-poverty programmes but anti-ageing drugs. Those who object to anti-ageing research usually complain about the cost, but that ignores the savings the world could make if the effects of ageing were staved off. </p> <p>\"First off, ending ageing would directly help eliminate a large and growing class of poor people: the elderly who are ill, earning little and spending lots on medical care. If healthy, these people could contribute greatly to society, and give us more resources with which to address other causes of poverty ... If people didn't need treatment for and weren't incapacitated by ageing-related diseases, the money saved and generated would vastly outweigh what was spent on anti-ageing research, freeing up additional resources to help raise the standard of living for all ... For economic reasons alone it makes sense to fund an end to ageing.\" </p> <p>The decline in birth rates provides a further incentive to keep the elderly healthy, argued Smith. \"Every ageing-related death will be additionally painful when we have fewer and fewer young people to fill key roles ... Keeping today's productive minds healthy must be an important goal if we're to properly cope with demographic changes.\" </p> <p><b> Music makes you lose control</b><br> </p> <p> \"Music matters ... For some people it matters more than anything else. Yet, the how and why of its mattering remains an enigma for us ... This is where a little philosophy might help,\" said Simon Critchley in the <b> Philosophers' Magazine</b> (issue 28). </p> <p>For the Pythagoreans, music was \"a reflection of the mathematical harmony and perfection of the universe\" and, \"insofar as musical harmony [is] in tune with the harmony of the the universe ... music is the key by which we might enter the mind of God.\" A nice idea, said Critchley, but \"the universe is not there for us, it is just there.\" A more modern take on the situation is required, and it was Nietzsche who struck the right note. </p> <p>For him, music was \"an articulation of what he calls the Dionysian , the primal life of desire, the deathly, dangerous and discordant core of consciousness that he identifies with the experience of Rausch: intoxication, ecstasy or literally rush\". But \"direct contact\" with these \"Dionysian springs\" would \"destroy us, suffocate us\". The glimpse that music offers instead \"gives us intimations of our mortality, dangerous but joyful intimations. Without music we are diminished, we become what the poet Wallace Stevens would call 'mere castratos of moon-mash'.\" Or as Nietzsche put it: \"Without music, life would be an error.\"</p>",
  "After months of flawless execution in a well-orchestrated campaign, President Bush had to stand alone in an unpredictable debate. He had travelled the country, appearing before adoring pre-selected crowds, delivered a carefully crafted acceptance speech before his convention, and approved tens of millions of dollars in TV commercials to belittle his opponent. In the lead, Bush believed he had only to assert his superiority to end the contest once and for all. <p>But onstage the president ran out of talking points. Unable to explain the logic for his policies, or think on his feet, he was thrown back on the raw elements of his personality and leadership style. </p> <p>Every time he was confronted with ambivalence, his impulse was to sweep it aside. He claimed he must be followed because he is the leader. Fate, in the form of September 11, had placed authority in his hands as a man of destiny. Scepticism, pragmatism and empiricism are enemies. Absolute faith prevails over open-ended reason, subjectivity over fact. Belief in belief is the ultimate sacrament of his political legitimacy. </p> <p>In the split TV screen, how Bush felt was written all over his face. His grimaces exposed his irritation and anger at being challenged. Lacking intellectual stamina and repeating points as though on a feedback loop, he tried to close argument by assertion. With no one interrupting him, he protested, \"Let me finish\" - a phrase he occasionally deploys to great effect before the cowed White House press corps. </p> <p>John Kerry was set up beforehand as Bush's foil: long-winded, dour, dull. But the Kerry who showed up was crisp, nimble and formidable. His thrusts brought out Bush's rigidity and stubbornness. The more Bush pleaded his own decisiveness, the more he appeared reactive. </p> <p>Time and again, as he tried to halt Kerry, he accused him of \"mixed signals\" and \"inconsistency.\" For Bush, certainty equals strength. Kerry responded with a devastating deconstruction of Bush's epistemology. Nothing like this critique of pure reason has ever been heard in a presidential debate. \"It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong,\" said Kerry. </p> <p>Kerry's analysis of Bush's \"colossal error of judgment\" in Iraq was systematic, factual and historical. The coup de grace was the citation of the president's father's actions in the Gulf war. \"You know,\" said Kerry, \"the president's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra. And the reason he didn't is, he said - he wrote in his book - because there was no viable exit strategy. And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land. That's exactly where we find ourselves today.\" With that, Kerry touched on Bush's most ambivalent relationship, the father he recently called \"the wrong father,\" compared to the \"Higher Father\". </p> <p>In flustered response, Bush simply insisted on his authority. \"I just know how this world works ... there must be certainty from the US president.\" He reverted to his claim that September 11 justified the invasion of Iraq because \"the enemy\" - Saddam Hussein - \"attacked us.\" A stunned but swift-footed Kerry observed: \"The president just said something extraordinarily revealing and frankly very important ... he just said, 'The enemy attacked us'. Saddam Hussein didn't attack us. Osama bin Laden attacked us.\" In his effort to banish all doubt, Bush had retreated into a substitute reality, a delusional version of Iraq, ultimately faith-based. </p> <p>Bush's attack lines on Kerry did not describe the surprising man standing opposite him. They had been effective last week, but were suddenly shopworn. But Bush couldn't adjust. The greater his frustration in the debate, the more frequently he spoke of his difficulties in coping with \"my job.\" Ten times he spoke of his \"hard work\": listening to intelligence briefings, talking to allies, having to comfort a bereaved mother whose son was killed in Iraq. </p> <p>Near the end, Kerry praised Bush for his public service, and his wife, and his daughters. \"I'm trying to put a leash on them,\" Bush said. That was hard work, too. \"Well, I don't know,\" replied Kerry, who also has daughters. \"I've learned not to do that, Mr President.\" Even in the banter, Kerry gained the upper-hand. </p> <p>But Bush lost more than control in the first debate. He has lost the plot. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">www.salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Saturday October 2</strong></p> <p><strong>Voyage Of The Damned</strong> (Stuart Rosenberg, 1976) <br>1.15pm, BBC2</p> <p>Based on the true story of a shipload of German Jews who were sent to Cuba by Goebbels in 1939, then returned to Germany when Havana refused to take them. The problem is that Rosenberg's drama all but sinks under the weight of its serious subject matter and ponderous script; and there are too many iffy performances from the big-star cast (Faye Dunaway, Malcolm McDowell, James Mason, Orson Welles and all). Max Von Sydow is exempted; his anguished ship's captain just about holds it together.</p> <p><strong>Relative Values</strong> (Eric Styles, 2000) <br>3.25pm, ITV1</p> <p>Not the fizziest of Noel Coward adaptations, this, but there's an enjoyable clash of snooty English and brash American stereotypes. Set in 1950s Britain, it has the marvellous, aristocratic Julie Andrews trying to stop her son (Edward Atterton) marrying Hollywood starlet Jeanne Tripplehorn who she discovers - horror of horrors - is her maid's sister. When the actress's former lover, movie star William Baldwin, crashes in like a herd of bulls in a china shop, problems escalate. With Colin Firth and Stephen Fry.</p> <p><strong>The Flying Leathernecks</strong> (Nicholas Ray, 1951) <br>4.20pm, BBC2</p> <p>Spectacular second world war feature with heroic marine pilots battling the Japanese hordes at Guadalcanal. Just what you'd expect from a John Wayne vehicle; but more interesting is the running battle between Wayne's hardnosed major and softy captain Robert Ryan, who wants him to go easier on the men.</p> <p><strong>The Mask Of Zorro</strong> (Martin Campbell, 1998) <br>5.30pm, BBC1</p> <p>Old California's own Robin Hood legend is overlong, but done with great verve. Antonio Banderas, a dashing hero in the Tyrone Power mould, is the rugged, buffoonish Murrieta, protege of the now elderly Zorro (Anthony Hopkins) who trains him to fight, ride and smile wickedly, and to take on corrupt Governor Montero (Stuart Wilson). Amid the zestful action, Catherine Zeta Jones plays Zorro's long-lost daughter, a pretty sharp blade herself.</p> <p><strong>The Iron Giant</strong> (Brad Bird, 1999) <br>5.30pm, Five</p> <p>A glorious animated version of Ted Hughes' children's story. It's set in Maine, 1957, when Sputnik was launched and the cold war was chilling bones worldwide. The 50ft-tall iron robot dwarfs local houses and snacks on cars, but at first only nine-year-old Hogarth sees and befriends him: then the panicky Feds and military arrive. Part action-packed, funny kids' adventure, part political allegory, it's an armour-plated success. Among the voices are Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr and Vin Diesel.</p> <p><strong>My Best Friend's Wedding</strong> (PJ Hogan, 1997) <br>9.10pm, C4</p> <p>A fun-filled modern take on the screwball comedy that saw Julia Roberts again doing big box-office. She's a cookery writer who realises, four days before her ex (Dermot Mulroney) is to marry Cameron Diaz, that she is still in love with him. Luckily her gay colleague (a very deft Rupert Everett) is on hand to pose as her beau, in order to make said ex jealous (look, it's not meant to make much sense. That's why it's screwball).</p> <p><strong>48 Hours</strong> (Walter Hill, 1982) <br>11.30pm, ITV1</p> <p>A frenetic, funny tale of a mismatched duo: bad-tempered, gravel-throated cop Nick Nolte, and, making an inspired debut, Eddie Murphy as a fast-mouthed con on 48 hours' leave from the slammer. They are hunting an exceptionally nasty pair of villains (James Remar, Sonny Landham) through the deadly streets of San Francisco, but spend as much time cursing and thumping each other as the bad guys.</p> <p><strong>Shadow Conspiracy</strong> (George P Cosmatos, 1997) <br>12 midnight, BBC1</p> <p>Charlie Sheen is presidential aide Bobby Bishop, uncovering a rightwing conspiracy in the White House; the only people he trusts (and maybe shouldn't) are his ex, reporter Linda Hamilton, and Donald Sutherland's chief of staff; meanwhile, Ben Gazarra's VP looks shifty as can be. But don't expect any scriptwriting subtleties.</p> <p><strong>Last Man Standing</strong> (Walter Hill, 1996) <br>12.20am, C4</p> <p>Kurosawa made it as Yojimbo, Leone as a Fistful Of Dollars, and Hill isn't far off the mark with this third telling of a classic tale. This one's set in a sepia-toned, dusty little prohibition-era Texas town ruled by rival Italian and Irish bootleggers. In the middle is Bruce Willis as John Smith, an infernally fast gunman playing both gangs off against each other. The plot, minimal to begin with, is pared to the bone, a series of claustrophobic, booming gunfights.</p> <p><strong>Sunday October 3</strong></p> <p><strong>Ivanhoe</strong> (Richard Thorpe, 1952) <br>1.45pm, Five</p> <p>Not exactly the Braveheart school of medieval adventure: this is an MGM historical extravagance, so the knights' armour is always burnished, and the stars shine bright. How they shine. Elizabeth Taylor is stunning as the Jewish beauty, Rebecca, who makes life difficult for Robert Taylor's almost-as-pretty Ivanhoe and his intended, Rowena (Joan Fontaine).</p> <p><strong>The King And I</strong> (Walter Lang, 1956) <br>4pm, ITV1</p> <p>A lavish and colourful musical, although it somehow remains pretty dull. Worlds collide when a British governess arrives in mid-19th century Bangkok to mind the King of Siam's children: fluttering about to Rodgers and Hammerstein songs, they are mutually charmed. But Yul Brynner (who incredibly won the best actor Oscar) and Deborah Kerr hardly crackle with cross-cultural passions.</p> <p><strong>Four Days In September</strong> (Bruno Barreto, 1997) <br>2.05am, C4</p> <p>A gripping drama based on the abduction of American ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick by a revolutionary group trying to highlight the injustices of the military dictatorship in late 1960s Brazil. Adapted from the book by Fernando Gabeira, one of the kidnappers who became a journalist, it's a balanced and absorbing account, with Alan Arkin excellent as Elbrick and Pedro Cardoso as Gabeira.</p> <p><strong>Monday October 4</strong></p> <p><strong>Pal Joey</strong> (George Sidney, 1957) <br>1.15pm, C4</p> <p>A scintillating Sinatra leads this predictable-but-who-cares Rodgers and Hart musical. He's brash Joey Evans, aiming for the top in San Francisco clubland and admired by waifish chanteuse Kim Novak and wealthy broad Rita Hayworth: his snarly rendition of The Lady Is A Tramp to the latter is a highlight.</p> <p><strong>Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry</strong> (John Hough, 1974) <br>12.20am, BBC1</p> <p>The 1960s and 1970s saw plenty of great road movies - Easy Rider, Two-Lane Blacktop, Vanishing Point - but this isn't one of them. Peter Fonda, still resting on his Easy Rider laurels, stars as Larry, who crazily grabs a bootful of dollars from a supermarket and heads tyre-shriekingly into the Californian distance; the passengers are Susan George, pouting away as Mary, with Adam Roarke as Deke the mechanic. Plenty of fancy stunt-driving, but without the existential angst, it's going nowhere.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday October 5</strong></p> <p><strong>The People Under The Stairs</strong> (Wes Craven, 1991) <br>11pm, ITV1</p> <p>A ghetto kid called Fool (Brandon Adams) breaks into an old dark house and encounters some very nasty goings-on: depraved couple Everett McGill and Wendy Robie are terrorising teenage girl AJ Langer, while in the bowels of the house (under the stairs) they keep a gang of cannibal kids who've lost their tongues. This is gruesome, heavyhanded horror with the odd joke thrown in, while Craven's social subtext about rapacious landlords and poor tenants gets lost in the gore.</p> <p><strong>Rocky IV</strong> (Sylvester Stallone, 1985) <br>11.20pm, BBC1</p> <p>Another punchathon for Stallone's boxing champ Rocky Balboa, here pitted against Dolph Lundgren's barely human Russian fighter, Drago: the product of sneaky Soviet laboratories as much as the gym, he's basically the Terminator in boxing gloves. Once Drago has beaten Rocky's pal Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) to death in the ring, there's only one course for the now veteran pugilist: go to Moscow and whup him in his own backyard. The weakest Rocky of the lot.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday October 6</strong></p> <p><strong>Duel</strong> (Steven Spielberg, 1971) <br>12.05am, BBC1</p> <p>The celebrated TV film that announced the arrival of an exceptional talent. The 23-year-old Spielberg's menacing road movie has Dennis Weaver's businessman terrorised by a beat-up old oil tanker on a remote American highway. We don't see the truck driver: it's simply an implacable (Jaws-like) force intent on running Weaver off the road. There are undertones of urban alienation to Richard Matheson's story, but basically it's an absolutely riveting, suspense-drenched adventure.</p> <p><strong>Thursday October 7</strong></p> <p><strong>The Final Test</strong> (Anthony Asquith, 1953) <br>1.35pm, C4</p> <p>Asquith teamed up again with his Winslow Boy writer Terence</p> <p>Rattigan for this cricketing tale. It's the last Test of a precariously poised series against the Aussies; batsman Jack Warner is making his last appearance, and in that traditionally stilted English way he yearns for support from his cricket-hating son. The match won't have you gnawing your umbrella handle in tension (chaps used to, you know), but John Arlott's vintage commentary is a delight.</p> <p><strong>The Nutty Professor</strong> (Tom Shadyac, 1996) <br>8pm, Five</p> <p>Crude, sometimes funny remake of the 1963 Jerry Lewis comedy, featuring Eddie Murphy in an Alec Guinness-like multi-role appearance. He plays the 28-stone geneticist Professor Sherman Klump, whose secret serum converts him into slim sexy Buddy Love (Murphy again). Klump loves student Carla (Jada Pinkett Smith); but Carla plumps for Love. Murphy also plays Klump's parents, his brother and his grandma, and the Klump clan scenes are a hoot - as are the special effects, when the slimline serum starts to lose its magical properties at the most inconvenient moments.</p> <p><strong>Friday October 8</strong></p> <p><strong>Thunder Bay</strong> (Anthony Mann, 1953) <br>1.25pm, C4</p> <p>Director Mann and star James Stewart collaborated on a series of great westerns that included Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, but this colourful Universal adventure is not in the same league. Stewart and Dan Duryea play ex-GIs drilling for oil off the Louisiana coast and upsetting the local shrimp fishermen: lots of action above water and under it, plus a little romance involving fisherman's daughter Joanne Dru.</p> <p><strong>Halloween H20</strong> (Steve Miner, 1998) <br>11.35pm, BBC1</p> <p>Twenty years on from John Carpenter's original Halloween, Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie, survivor of the encounter with teeny slasher Michael Myers, is now a twitchy alcoholic single mum with a teenager (Josh Hartnett) of her own. It's only a matter of time before Myers returns to his dirty work, and Miner has fun giving us several false starts before Laurie realises he's not a figment of her imagination but a real, live, nightmare. The middle sags a little, but Curtis is very watchable as the body count rises.</p> <p><strong>Joe Kidd</strong> (John Sturges, 1972) <br>12.35am, ITV1</p> <p>Directed by the man who made The Magnificent Seven, written by Elmore Leonard and starring Clint Eastwood who was riding high as the modern era's John Wayne, this ought to have been a top-gun western. But Sturges seems uncomfortable attempting a spaghetti western Hollywood style, and Leonard's script is a pretty ordinary tale pitting Clint's hired gun against land-grabbing rancher Robert Duvall.

  "Two men were jailed for life yesterday for shooting dead a bank worker in an apparently motiveless attack as she sat in her sports car. <p>Mr Justice Astill described the killers as \"despicable cowards who depend on extreme violence against the defenceless\" to get what they want. </p> <p>Pauline Peart, 25, died within minutes of a bullet passing through her back and into her heart, causing rapid and extensive bleeding, Orlando Pownall QC, prosecuting, had told the Old Bailey. </p> <p>Three months later, the gun was recovered from a kitchen flip-top bin at a flat where Maurice Miller, 21, had been staying, Mr Pownall told the jury. </p> <p>Miller, formerly from Enfield, north London, and his co-defendant, Nebra Bennett, 24, from Tottenham, north London, had both denied the murder of Miss Peart on March 10 last year. </p> <p>They were convicted at the Old Bailey on Thursday and sentencing was postponed until yesterday. They will each serve a minimum of 18 years and be sent back to Jamaica at the end of their sentence. </p> <p>Mr Justice Astill said: \"Both of you went out on the street jointly armed with a loaded gun. </p> <p>\"For reasons best known to you, you gunned down a young woman as she sat in her car. She was utterly vulnerable and utterly defenceless. </p> <p>\"Whatever happens to you now, you have the benefit of a life. But you have deprived that young woman of a life and her family of the joy of seeing her life develop. </p> <p>\"I have no doubt that you both believe that carrying a loaded gun and the posturing that goes with it increases the esteem in which you believe others hold you. </p> <p>\"But I want you to understand that, in our society, it has the opposite effect. </p> <p>\"It does not demonstrate power but demonstrates that both of you are despicable cowards who depend on extreme violence against the defenceless to get what you want.\" </p> <p>Ms Peart lived on her own in Waltham Abbey, Essex, and was a customer account manager with Beneficial Finance in north London. </p> <p>Mr Pownall said Ms Peart, who did not know either defendant, was in her left-hand-drive silver Audi cabriolet car in Hampden Road, Tottenham, talking to a friend, Yemmi Johnson, as he sat in the passenger seat. </p> <p>The car window was partially open. \"Miller shot her using the gun which police eventually recovered from a flip-top bin at his address. There does not appear to be any apparent motive for shooting her,\" said Mr Pownall. </p> <p>Miller claimed in an interview with police that Bennett had fired the fatal shot and that Mr Johnson had shown disrespect in the past. Bennett had denied being in the road with Miller that night. </p> <p>Mr Johnson told police that three youths had walked past them in Hampden Road, Tottenham, at around 11.30pm. A few minutes later he saw a youth in a white top who appeared to be trying to open the driver's door. </p> <p>Mr Pownall said: \"The door was locked but the window was slightly open. The youth was crouching and looking in. He saw the barrel of a gun through the aperture. </p> <p>\"Understandably, Mr Johnson ducked down. He heard a shot and screamed to Miss Peart to start the car. She replied that the car was on. She arched her back and began convulsing.\" </p> <p>Ms Peart's sister, Donna Swaby, said outside court that her family were still coming to terms with the \"senseless\" murder. </p> <p>\"She meant everything to us and we miss her very much. Today justice has been done and that has helped us to put a close to a chapter of our lives. </p> <p>\"The people responsible have still to disclose why Pauline was taken from us, leaving a vacuum in our hearts and souls.\"</p>",
  "<p>For the past quarter of a century I have been hoarding, saving and protecting my collection of Matchbox cars. There are about 80 in total, in varying condition. Many, had they been life-sized, would have been scrapped, cubed and crushed. But I've kept them, and the reason I kept them was that one day I hoped to be able to pass them on to my son, who could then spend his entire youth playing with them, as I had. Sadly, this was not to be, as a so-called \"friend\" of the family gave my son for his third birthday a prepackaged \"collection\" of 75 cars, which cost \u00a39.99 from the supermarket. It took me 10 years and a sum roughly equivalent to \u00a31m in today's money to amass my collection. My son doesn't need it now so I have decided, through the pages of Guardian Weekend, to bequeath it to the nation. </p> <p><strong>Mercedes Benz 220SE</strong><br> Of all my collection, this is the car with the most things that opened. The boot opened, the front doors opened and the bonnet also opened, revealing the engine. Normally, you only got one of the three: boot, doors or bonnet. To get all three was a bonus, but you did begin to wonder about the structural integrity of the vehicle. This car also had headlights that looked as if they were on - except in the dark, when they looked off. Sadly, the car was held back by its final feature, which was steerable wheels. When I say steerable, they were steerable in the supermarket trolley sense of the word, in that they had a mind of their own. This made driving extremely difficult and it was an absolute non-performer on Hot Wheels Track. On the other hand it did appear to have independent suspension on every wheel, which seemed, and still seems, an unnecessary luxury for a Matchbox car. But then it wasn't a Matchbox car. It was an Impy Supercar, which is a company I've never heard of. They probably put all their research and development budget into this one car and then went under. </p> <p><strong>MG 1100</strong><br> This is the second oldest car in the collection and, strangely, also in the best condition. I did actually have one older than this. It was a VW Fastback, which my father gave me because he had the grown-up version. I don't remember much about Dad's car except it was the only unreliable VW ever built and starting it required getting into your best business suit, turning the key 18 times, then crawling underneath it to hit it with a hammer. Maybe I'd built up some resentment against the car because I remember deciding to turn my own model into a convertible. The surgery was badly botched and the VW ended up in the garden, the graveyard of Matchbox cars. In comparison, this MG 1100 was everything products of the British car industry should have been: long lasting, beautifully engineered and a pleasure to drive, especially on carpets. The MG 1100 has a dog on the back seat, recognisably a collie. The man driving also has on a V-neck sweater. I believe wearing a V-neck sweater was part of the requirement for passing your driving test in those days. </p> <p><strong>Sand Drifter</strong><br> I found this Hot Wheels Sand Drifter at the bottom of a swimming pool in Austin, Texas. We were taken out there by my father, who then left us for weeks at a time to swim and feed ourselves on the native food, which, as far as I can remember, was Dr Pepper and Peppermint Patties - mints the size of your head. The pool was called Deep Eddy, which is a fantastic name for a swimming pool (I believe it was named after a local philosopher). Deep Eddy was outside, which was nice in that you were in the midst of nature, but not so nice in that a lot of nature ended up floating on the surface. Many a time I would swim an impressive width to find I had a mat of maple leaves on my head and some of the world's scariest insects attached to my little English trunks. I don't know what the Sand Drifter was doing at the bottom, but my guess is that its previous owner was testing its all-terrain capability. Or maybe he accidentally let it drop and then couldn't see it on the bottom because of the thick mat of maple leaves on the surface. The originally orange Sand Drifter received a nasty green paint job when it, and several similar vehicles, were called up for military service shortly after my return to England. </p> <p><strong>Nissan Laurel 2000SGX</strong><br> Due to some fierce weight restrictions imposed by my parents on our trip to Texas, I was forbidden to take my burgeoning Matchbox car collection. At one stage, they suggested I could take my one favourite car. I suggested in return that they might like to take their one favourite child. I think this response had my pocket money docked for a month and my luggage allowance halved. (My father started docking our pocket money before he started giving us pocket money, so that by the time it started we were very badly in debt.) At that time, much of America hadn't woken up to the joys of Matchbox cars and young Texan boys had to wrestle calves into the dust rather than parallel-park lines of small cars (there's a lesson there somewhere). I eventually stumbled on a shop that had two cars for sale, neither of which I recognised from British roads. The one I chose was the Nissan Laurel 2000SGX, made by Yatming of Hong Kong. This was the first Japanese car in my collection and I had inadvertently caught the first salvo in the Japanese assault on the world car market. Significantly, it's still in beautiful condition and running like a dream. </p> <p><strong>Freeman Intercity Commuter</strong><br> My brother Ralph was older than me by one year and one month. In his 13 months head start, he perfected nearly all the skills required in ruthless capitalist exploitation. When I was old enough to be ruthlessly exploited, he instituted a \"game\" called trading, in which he would trade an Opal Fruit for one of my prized possessions. Lime was my favourite Opal Fruit and he would take advantage of this by offering me two limes for something like my bed. Before I was very old, everything I owned he owned. As soon as a trade was complete, out would come the Humbrol enamel paint, and on my prize thing would appear, \"This belongs to Ralph Browning.\" This would make trading things back out of the question, especially as one of the early trades secured him my collection of Humbrol paints. It's therefore a complete mystery how my brother's Freeman Intercity Commuter came to be in my collection. I can only assume he thought he was getting a very good deal indeed. The price would probably have been something like one of my kidneys. The vehicle itself seems to be a very good-looking prototype for an Espace-style MPV. I've never seen one in real life, so it was clearly far too ahead of its time. As was my brother, who now lives in a self-sufficient commune in north Wales making up for past capitalist crimes. </p> <p><strong>Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow</strong><br> My Uncle Victor was a dentist and clearly had money because he drove a Jaguar. I don't know whether it was my birthday or whether he was feeling particularly flush after some private crowning work, but either way he bought me some Hot Wheels Track, which every boy needed to race his cars on. I say \"some\" advisedly, because my father's policy, had we been rash enough to lash out on Hot Wheels Track, would have been to buy one piece first and see how we got on with that. Uncle Victor took me to Howse's model shop in Oxford, which had for sale more Matchbox cars than I had ever seen in one place. Shockingly, Uncle Victor also said I could have the car of my choice to go with the track. I plumped for the Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, thinking that it would probably be more expensive than all the others and that Uncle Victor wouldn't notice. I also remember that the man behind the counter said I had expensive tastes. This confirmed me in my decision. You'll notice that the Rolls-Royce is in relatively good condition. That's because shortly afterwards it disappeared into my brother's under-the-bed storage facility and stayed there for the next 20 years. </p> <p><strong>Mercury Station Wagon</strong><br> This car was the biggest in my collection. It was clearly an American car at the time when American cars were seeing how big they could get and still fit on one side of the road. Where the MG 1100 had one dog, this had two hanging out of the back window. About four years after I acquired my Mercury I found myself right in the back of one with Amy Talbot from the local youth club in Austin, Texas. This youth club was incredibly wealthy and had better resources than most schools in Britain. Every other week we would go on an outing which you'd normally have to pay a top travel agent to arrange for you. This particular trip necessitated a short drive (400 miles in Texas). The youth club leaders sat in the front of the Mercury and some half a mile back I lay down with Amy Talbot in the luggage area (no dogs) and attempted to improve my carnal knowledge. That car was so big I'm pretty sure that our youth leaders knew absolutely nothing about it. Mind you, given the size of the front seat they were probably doing exactly the same thing. Amy Talbot is now a Southern Baptist minister campaigning for young women to remain chaste for as long as possible. </p> <p><strong>Mercury Cougar</strong><br> A neighbour of mine actually has one of these standing in his drive. A life-size one (he's sad, but not that sad) which he drives to his mother's every Christmas and returns courtesy of the AA. I should make it clear that the model I have is actually a stand-in for one of my all-time favourite cars. The original was stolen by my best friend for three and a quarter years, Jonathan Winter. In those days, young boys used to race cars against each other, especially if there was a lot of Hot Wheels Track available. Cars were displayed, swapped and, if there were despicable little toerags like Jonathan Winter around, stolen. Of course, he never admitted to stealing it, but I counted them all out and I counted them all back, minus one Mercury Cougar. For obvious reasons, our friendship ended shortly afterwards and I am pretty certain that if he is not in some crack house now, Jonathan Winter will be banged up for theft and, if the judge did his job properly, some pretty underhand moves at Subbuteo as well. </p> <p><strong>Ford Transit Caravan</strong><br> I stole this one from my friend Paul Chance. It was a dormobile, which was a type of vehicle I hadn't come across before, and I needed to take it home for some serious road testing. Interestingly, despite having the drag coefficient of a masonry brick, it was one of the fastest cars in the Hot Wheels Track events we staged all the way down Paul's sloping drive. The Ford Transit had opening doors at the back, which revealed a very well-appointed kitchen and living space. There was also a little removable rambler, which we took great pride in running down with our Land Rovers and Sand Drifters (I'm sorry, that's completely made up). Looking back, what I should have stolen was one of Stephen Willet's blue Ford Cortinas. Firstly, this would have enhanced my range of Fords and, secondly, it would have reduced Stephen's huge number of blue Ford Cortinas. He must have had seven or eight of these, all identical, and I never found out why. Even now when I'm trying to be adult and philosophical and address the great questions of life, it's still the great mystery that haunts me. </p> <p><strong>Leyland Pipe Truck</strong><br> This lorry had plastic pipes on the back, obviously all long gone. The Leyland seemed to be the only lorry Matchbox made, because I also had a Leyland dumper truck, a Leyland petrol tanker and a Leyland lorry with a wooden cabin on the back. Maybe these were the only lorries around at the time. They certainly had a very pleasing mien and an attractive configuration of wheels. What they didn't have was any sense of proportion. This pipe lorry was slightly smaller than the Ford Zodiac and, if it had been laying pipes of the same scale, someone, somewhere would have been very short of gas. As a boy, I was quite sensitive about scale (don't read too much into that) and I simply couldn't allow these dwarf lorries to be in the same game as normal-size cars. The net result of this was that the lorries didn't get out much as greasy spoon lorry park at dawn isn't much of a game. Neither were they stolen much, which explains why I still have so many good-condition Leyland lorries in my collection. I suppose the big question is, \"Where did they all come from in the first place?\" </p> <p><strong>Ford GT</strong><br> There was a brief period in my life when my belief in Father Christmas was waning and my belief in Matchbox cars as the ultimate guarantor of personal happiness was emerging. At Christmas during my childhood we used to wake up and find a stocking on the end of our bed. I know the pampered youth of today have pillow cases and bin liners at the end of their beds, but we had a stocking equivalent to a shoe size of about four, slim fitting. In it we generally had a new face flannel, a toothbrush and a tangerine. There might have been other items unrelated to the relentless push to improve our hygiene/vitamin levels, but they escape me. This all changed one year when I found the glorious Le Mans-winning Ford GT in my stocking. My first thought was that Father Christmas might actually be Uncle Victor, but my father soon talked me out of that. Sadly, shortly after getting it, I pranged one of the wheels, so what should have been one of my fastest cars became a sort of ornament, admired only for its fine lines. </p> <p><strong>Ford Zodiac</strong><br> In the same year I received the Ford GT in my Christmas stocking, my brother got a green Ford Zodiac. There must have been a commercial tie-up with Ford that year. My brother was quick to point out that the bonnet of his Zodiac opened, whereas nothing did anything on my GT. He pointed this out a lot, probably because my car was a lot cooler and, to my certain knowledge, no Ford Zodiac had ever won Le Mans. Even more remarkably, according to Ralph, under the bonnet of the Ford Zodiac was a removable spare tyre. This, of course, meant it was removed once and lost. Opening bonnets were quite a hit in those days and we spent many happy hours playing hard shoulder, where Ralph's Ford Zodiac would sit on the hard shoulder with its bonnet up and spare tyre missing, until my crippled Ford GT slewed off the motorway into the Zodiac, killing all its occupants. The bonnet came off altogether some time later and the Zodiac lost some of its cachet. It joined my collection shortly afterwards in return for my beloved Raleigh Tomahawk bicycle. </p> <p><strong>Trailer Caravan</strong><br> My son, who as we speak is happily playing with his 75 rubbish models of unidentifiable modern cars on which nothing opens anywhere, has a passion for trailers. He refuses to play with a tractor unless it's towing something and doing some useful work. I suspect he thinks a trailer is a unit and anything less than that is suspiciously incomplete. Anyway, this slightly odd notion must come from his mother's side because it's not something I share. Take, for example, this caravan with the detachable roof and detachable living accommodation for four. Had it been worth playing with, its detachable bits would now be in that great detachable parts bin in the sky. The fact that it's still in one piece, or three pieces, just shows how little play action it got. It was used as a mobile command and control centre for difficult traffic management situations, but it saw precious little towing. One of the reasons for this is my strong ethical reservation about the Matchbox policy of putting towbars on unsuitable vehicles. For example, you didn't buy a Lamborghini to find that it was fully equipped for towing caravans or horseboxes. Despite my personal reservations, it's the one item in my collection I am going to bequeath to my son. He'll know what to do with it.</p>",
  "<p>As embarrassing-parent moments go, it's up there with walking your child to school accidentally wearing slippers, or that time you tore a ligament and had to be airlifted to hospital from the school playing field after trying too hard in the sports day egg and spoon race, or the occasion you drove home from the supermarket and forgot the baby, leaving it propped up in a shopping trolley. </p> <p>It's the moment when The Wheels On The Bus or some other similarly mind-numbing dross has been playing on continuous loop on the car stereo for several hours, and you finally snap. To stunned silence swiftly followed by baleful sobbing in the back, one or other furious parent will rip that tape out of the player and turn the air blue with vicious character assessments of the gurning session-singing idiots pictured on its front cover, before ripping it to shreds in a raging frenzy and chucking it out of the window. </p> <p>I feel no guilt when I think about Mickey's Favourite Disney Tunes Volume 3, which is probably still struggling to biodegrade at the side of the road near Fleet services in Hampshire after being jettisoned during a particularly torturous aural onslaught nine years ago. That's when we reached breaking point. That's when we resolved to reclaim control of the in-car musical entertainment and, from then on, introduce our children to proper music. </p> <p>It hasn't all been plain sailing. They struggled with Radiohead - \"Mummy, why is that man whining so much? It's naughty to whine\" - and had little time for some of our favourite tunes from the more obscure reaches of the Rodgers and Hammerstein back catalogue. Nevertheless, we persevered, smugly congratulating ourselves on what it is to be broad-minded, conscientious parents intent on bestowing musical eclecticism on their children. There followed some Beatles and a lot of David Bowie, a wide range of classical music, a little jazz and a smattering of Alison Krauss. From Fats Waller to Jeff Buckley, Ella Fitzgerald to George Formby, I think we can safely say we have done a reasonable job of covering most bases. </p> <p>All except one. God forbid that anything with a hard rock bent ever shattered the amiable calm of our lengthy holiday excursions. Beat me to a pulp with the business end of a Fender Stratocaster if our car ever played host to anything that issued from the guitar strings of lardy-arsed white men with bad hair. It would never happen. But that was before School Of Rock and its accompanying soundtrack came out earlier this year. Now, ever since the film that stars Jack Black as a teacher who turns a bunch of middle-American prep-school kids into a rock band, my children's musical tastes have taken a very disturbing turn. </p> <p>As I write, there is a toe-curling racket coming from upstairs, shattering the distinctly MOR, Paul Weller-induced peace of our kitchen. It is my daughter, attempting to pick out the opening bars of Cream's Sunshine Of Your Love on a classical guitar minus one string. Accompanied by her brother on a toy snare drum, she then segues into a halting rendition of Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin, finishing up with a Who medley. </p> <p>At various points during this performance, they come down and stand in the middle of the kitchen floor, playing air guitar and shaking their heads around in a way guaranteed to cause, if not gross parental distress, then at the very least lasting brain damage. </p> <p>I am distraught. Other film scores have come and gone (\"What was wrong with The Sound Of Music or Mary Poppins?\" I wail, fruitlessly) but this one seems to have stuck. From here, surely, it is a small step to becoming lank-haired, short-sighted no-mates who should have gone to Specsavers but instead hang out in comic shops at weekends wearing grimy Mot\u00f6rhead T-shirts. </p> <p>In my desperation, I offer a not very informed, sweeping critique of all rock musicians - of their fondness for songs totally lacking in nuance, of the sorry state of blinkeredness that fosters the sort of obstinately white, culturally exclusive din that rarely troubles itself with piffling concerns such as melody or harmonic cohesion. </p> <p>Could it be that living in the country leaves my children more open to the lure of the men with nasty trousers and bad skin? Heavy metal has always struck me as a distinctly provincial affliction, its hairy-faced backwardness untouched by the sophisticated gloss of metropolitanism. I don't care how urban its fans claim to be - somehow they all end up looking as if they come from the more obscure reaches of Shropshire. </p> <p>I thought we'd neatly sidestepped metal with the recent purchase of the Darkness's Permission To Land (at least they have hair that looks as if it has had a passing acquaintanceship with a product or two, I reasoned). Possibly it wasn't hard-rocking enough for my children's newly metallicised tastes, however, as it enjoyed a single outing and has never seen the light of day since. Nevertheless, with Robot Wars, Scrapheap Challenge and other magnets for beardy loners from the provinces increasingly prevalent in our house, it looks as if metal has snuck in through our back door. The worrying thing is, it isn't showing signs of leaving any time soon.</p>",
  "Contrary to the impression given by John Sutherland (Britain's senior citizens are toothless warriors, G2, September 27), there is a British counterpart of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) - the Association of Retired and Persons Over 50, founded in 1988 to promote the interests of Britain's 20 million senior citizens. <p> While I agree with Mr Sutherland that there is no united voice for older people in the UK that combines the political and social clout exerted by AARP, our association does work closely with other senior citizens' organisations to influence govern ment thinking on important welfare, employment and social issues.

A second rocket killed three people, apparently all civilians, near a school.</p> <p>The Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qureia, called the Israeli offensive \"state terror\" and called for international intervention.</p> <p>The Israeli army says its troops will focus on hunting down Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, searching for rocket-manufacturing workshops, and demolishing houses which provide cover for the missiles to be fired.</p> <p>But a dozen previous such operations have failed to stop the rockets, including the army's five-week occupation of Beit Hanoun in the summer.</p> <p>Hamas demonstrated the continued difficulty of ending the attacks by firing another rocket into Sderot yesterday, without causing injury.</p> <p>Several cabinet ministers proposed putting additional pressure on the civilian population.

  "<p>Britain's third-division stock market warned this week that it was at risk of relegation to the corporate graveyard. Ofex facilitates trading in 140 companies' shares, Arsenal Football Club among them, but unless it can raise new money itself the final whistle will be blown next month. </p> <p>Ofex is a young, cheap and cheerful market. Begun in 1995, its management and ownership is a family affair. Until this summer the only market maker in the shares listed on the exchange was JP Jenkins, the firm of Ofex's founding chairman, John Jenkins. For some this smacked of conflict, for others it was just too homespun - especially as Mr Jenkins' children are joint managing directors and more than 50% of the firm is in the family's hands. </p> <p>Ofex therefore stacked the odds against itself. The London Stock Exchange's own second-division market, Aim, has been a roaring success in recent years. It now attracts companies from around the globe to its list - one from China only this week - knocking spots off its bigger brother and leaving Ofex in its shadow. Aim's success has highlighted the paucity of Ofex's regulation-lite offering. As ever in life, you get what you pay for. </p> <p>Amid Ofex's financial and commercial troubles a faint glimmer of hope can be discerned. As is often the case in a near-bankruptcy situation, a convulsion in ownership and management may accompany an emergency fundraising. Simon Brickles, recently departed from the LSE where he was head of Aim, is on the fringes of the situation as a consultant to Ofex. Not everyone within the LSE's new offices in Paternoster Square has been complimentary about Mr Brickles since his departure, but the wider stock market fraternity holds him in high regard. For only a couple of million pounds, a new investor should be able to secure control, fund the business's running costs for a couple of years and dangle a meaningful equity incentive before Mr Brickles' eyes. </p> <p>All of which would at least extend Ofex's life, which would surely give the Jenkins family some cause for satisfaction that its efforts had not all been in vain. But this does not mean that such an investment would be wise. The number of companies listing on Ofex has been dwindling, just as the numbers joining Aim have been booming. This trend will be reversible only if there is a genuine need for a tertiary market. </p> <p>Stock markets exist for two principal reasons: to provide a mechanism whereby shares in companies can change hands and to enable businesses to raise fresh capital. For many small companies share trading and fundraising are infrequent events. Once listed, many curse the running costs associated with the maintenance of a share-trading facility that is used only spasmodically. These costs are not just the annual fees levied by the governing exchange but the corporate paraphernalia of independent directors, investor relations advisers and the like. </p> <p>Ofex has stripped down these costs to modest levels. It charges businesses a few thousand pounds for a listing and the regulatory burden placed on companies is slim. In return they cannot expect access to huge pools of potential investment funds. The lighter the regulatory regime, the warier investors will be. Furthermore, although there is now a small coterie of Ofex market makers providing liquidity to the system, they are unlikely to improve materially the efficiency of the market. If a tiny company can attract little investor attention, the buying and selling of its shares will be in effect by appointment only. Market makers will not want to carry proportionately big inventories of Ofex shares in the hope that buyers will wander along one day to relieve them of their burdens. </p> <p>If Ofex is to prosper, it must find ways to attract dynamic young companies and risk-loving investors prepared to take a long view. Of course, there is an element of chicken and egg about this challenge. Moreover, there will always be the temptation for successful companies to graduate from Ofex to Aim or the main market in search of bigger pools of liquidity. </p> <p>One solution may be to create an ownership structure for the market akin to a mutual. Perhaps investors, listed companies, market makers and corporate financiers could all earn stakes in the exchange according to the business that they transact on it. In time this will generate a self-perpetuating interest in bringing companies to Ofex and keeping them there. Mutuality served the LSE and other exchanges well for centuries. Only in the past couple of decades has it become unfashionable. Maybe, though, it is right in this instance to try turning back the clock. Either way, it would be a shame if some method cannot be found to give Ofex one last chance at life. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Edmond Warner is chief executive of IFX Group </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edmond.warner@theguardian.com\">edmond.warner@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Michael Theakston, who has died after a short illness aged 79, could have been forgiven for expecting a quiet, but pleasant, life when he became chairman of his family's brewery in Masham, north Yorkshire, in 1968. </p> <p>But any thoughts of simply brewing good, traditional beer for sale in the Yorkshire Dales were dashed when the company was dragged into the maelstrom of a fast-changing brewing industry, with big regional and national groups jostling for domination and swallowing smaller companies along the way. </p> <p>Theakston was born in Putney, south-west London, but had close links with the brewery. He was the great-grandson of the founder Robert Theakston, who had started brewing at the Black Bull pub in Masham in 1827, and was the grandson of Thomas Theakston, who built the present brewery in 1875. His own father was a mechanical engineer, but was also a director of the brewery. </p> <p>Theakston served with the Royal Marines during the second world war, and then worked as a chartered engineer in Australia, the Philippines and Africa, where he installed mining equipment. He married in 1954 and, with four young sons, settled in Yorkshire. He joined the family brewery, T&amp;R Theakston, in 1968, and ran the company with his young cousin, Paul. </p> <p>The 1960s were a turbulent time in British brewing. Six national brewing groups, which emerged as the result of takeovers and mergers, attempted to change the face of brewing and consumer preference by switching from traditional beer to pressurised keg ales and then to lager. </p> <p>The arrival of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) in the early 1970s, with its vigorous revolt against keg beer, boosted the fortunes of the small breweries that had managed to survive. Theakston's became a cult brand as beer lovers discovered its now legendary strong ale, Old Peculier: the name marks the time, in the Middle Ages, when Masham was a \"peculier\", a parish outside the jurisdiction of a bishop. </p> <p>Theakston soon found that the small brewery could not cope with the increased demand for his beers. In 1974, the company bought the closed Carlisle Brewery, which had been part of a state-management scheme during the first world war, when brewery and pubs were nationalised in a bid to stop munitions workers consum ing too much alcohol and harming the war effort. </p> <p>The additional capacity allowed Theakston to develop an export market for his beers, including an alcohol-free beverage for the Gulf states. But Carlisle was too big a site, and proved a financial drain on Theakston's resources. Outside investors joined the board, while the local press painted a picture of a family at war, with Michael and Paul tussling over the future of the brewery. </p> <p>In 1984, Theakston's was taken over by Matthew Brown, a large regional brewery based in Blackburn. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, which had a poor presence in the fast-growing real-ale market, bought Brown's in 1987. In the turmoil that followed, Theakston remained as chairman at Masham, while Paul resigned and later launched his own Black Sheep Brewery in the town. </p> <p>S&amp;N closed Matthew Brown, as its main aim had been to control the Theakston's brands. Volumes expanded, but the beers lost some of their gloss when Camra criticised Theakston's for allowing the bulk of production to come from S&amp;N's Tyneside plant. </p> <p>Theakston eventually stood down as chairman, but continued to play a close role in the brewery, taking parties of visitors round the site, which included one of the few remaining coopers' workshops where wooden casks were made. In 2000, when it seemed that the White Bear pub in Masham might be turned into holiday flats, he and his sons, Simon, Nick, Tim and Edward, took over the lease from S&amp;N and ran the pub successfully with a good choice of cask beers. </p> <p>In his will, Theakston left instructions for a cask of the brewery's beer to be served in the White Bear \"for his dispatch to be properly celebrated\". He was delighted when S&amp;N sold the brewery back to his sons last year. </p> <p>This was not altruism on S&amp;N's part, but recognition of its declining interest in ale, as it owns Kronenbourg lager as well as a growing business in Russia and the Baltic States. The sons are now busily rebuilding sales and loyalty for the beers their father supported with gusto for more than 30 years. They, and his wife Jano, survive him. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Michael James Theakston, brewer, born August 15 1925; died September 8 2004</p>",
  "Israeli forces killed at least 23 Palestinians yesterday on one of the bloodiest days of the intifada, as the army made a rare push into the heart of a heavily defended Gaza refugee camp. <p>A single tank shell claimed seven lives, many of them said by witnesses to be unarmed teenagers. But doctors said it was difficult to tell because the bodies were blown apart. </p> <p>More than 100 people were wounded, including children, as Palestinian insurgents put up prolonged resistance to the attack on Jabaliya, a Hamas and Islamic Jihad stronghold. </p> <p>Israel's defence minister, Shaul Mofaz, said he intended to widen the army's assault beyond the camp, just north of Gaza City, after Wednesday's Hamas rocket attack that killed two children, aged two and four, in the Israeli town of Sderot. </p> <p>Ariel Sharon's security cabinet was expected to meet last night to approve a \"large-scale and prolonged operation\" that would include extended reoccupation of parts of the Gaza Strip. Similar military campaigns in the recent past have failed to curb the firing of rockets. </p> <p>Last night another of the crudely produced rockets known as Qassams, made by Hamas, hit an industrial area of Sderot without causing injury. </p> <p>Three Israelis were killed yesterday: two soldiers, and a settler who was out jogging when she was shot by a Palestinian sniper. </p> <p>The army faced considerable resistance from Palestinians firing rockets and automatic weapons as it moved into the centre of Jabaliya for the first time in the four years of intifada, seizing control of a UN school and a high building to post snipers. Most of the dead appeared to be Palestinian fighters, although they also included a 60 year-old man. </p> <p>The shell that killed seven people was fired by a tank next to the school. The army said the tank was responding to a rocket attack. The wounded included 10-year-old Ahmed Salem, who was hit in the leg by shrapnel. </p> <p>\"There was a man next to me who had no head,\" he said. </p> <p>Amid chaotic scenes at the Kamal Adwan hospital, its director, Mahmoud Asali, said more than 100 people were wounded in yesterday's fighting, with many in a critical condition. </p> <p>\"There are some without legs, some without arms, some without eyes. More will die,\" said Dr Asali. </p> <p>While Israeli troops seized control of key buildings in the camp of about 100,000 people, Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters continued to move around with relative ease, carrying rocket propelled grenades and shoulder-launched missiles. </p> <p>\"If they think they can conquer Jabaliya they are fools,\" said a masked Hamas fighter who gave his name only as Hassan. \"This will be their grave. They know that. Look at them hiding in the buildings. </p> <p>\"Are we terrorists for resisting when they come and de stroy our homes and kill us? They say it is to stop the Qassams. How many rockets have they fired at our homes?\" </p> <p>It was unclear what the army hoped to achieve by moving into Jabaliya. It is unlikely to be able to prevent more rocket attacks against Sderot. The limited effectiveness of such operations was demonstrated by the army's occupation of another northern Gaza town, Beit Hanoun, for five weeks in July and August, ostensibly to stop rocket attacks. Soldiers killed 20 people, destroyed 400 hectares (1,000 acres) of orange groves and other agricultural land, and demolished 68 homes; but the rockets kept flying. </p> <p>Leaflets were yesterday dropped over northern Gaza by Israeli helicopters, warning Palestinians that \"terrorism pushes you further into a life of misery and poverty\". </p> <p>Palestinians took that to mean that they were all being punished for the rocket attacks, because Mr Sharon feared such attacks could cause an Israeli backlash against his plan to pull all Jewish settlers out of the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>Gaza's former security chief, Mohammed Dahlan, who is backed by Britain to play a leading role in the territory after the Israeli withdrawal, said the raid on Jabaliya would \"result in a bloodbath on both sides, because the Palestinian people cannot remain silent in the face of this aggression\". </p> <p>The escalation in Gaza comes in part because Hamas has been able to pack more explosives into its rudimentary Qassams. For nearly four years, the rockets killed no one, but in recent months they have claimed the lives of three children in Sderot and one other Israeli. </p> <p>There is also a determination by both sides to shape interpretations of the Israeli pull out. Hamas is already claiming it as a victory for the insurgency, and wants to bolster its claim that the Israelis are withdrawing under fire. That is the perception that Mr Sharon is determined to avoid as he tries to project the withdrawal as a bold step towards peace.</p>",
  "More than a million people have signed a petition calling for a referendum to abolish a new Italian law on assisted reproduction which will make it harder for infertile couples to obtain treatment. <p>\"It's a historic triumph,\" said Daniele Capezzone, secretary of the Radical party, who delivered the signed petition forms to the court of cassation. </p> <p>\"There had better not be any shenanigans now. We ask the parties [which voted for the law] to step back and not even think of doing the people out of this referendum.\" </p> <p>Italy has frequently held referendums on disputed laws but it is rare for so many people to sign the petition. Italian law gave the campaigners until yesterday to gather the 500,000 signatures required to force a referendum. </p> <p>If the court approves the list, without finding duplicate names or other discrepancies, the government will have to accept a referendum. </p> <p>The fertility law is seen by many as an attack on Italy's secular democracy by traditional Catholic-minded MPs. The law, which came into effect in April, aimed to fill a legislative vacuum and end Italy's reputation as the \"wild west\" of fertility treatment. </p> <p>But, in attempting to protect the rights of the embryo, the law has made fertility treatment harder or impossible for thousands of Italian couples desperate for help. </p> <p>The law allows only \"stable\" couples of child-bearing age to seek in vitro fertilisation treatment and they can only use their own eggs or sperm. </p> <p>Embryos can no longer be frozen for research and couples are allowed to create only three embryos at a time, all of which must be implanted together, without being screened in advance for abnormalities. </p> <p>Medical experts and opposition politicians say it is a Catholic law that is \"anti-women\" and \"morally disgusting\". Polls show that more than half the populations want to change or abolish it. </p> <p>Hospitals say that in the five months after the law was passed the success rate for IVF treatment dropped from one in four to one in nine. </p> <p>Hundreds of couples have fled the restrictions to seek more flexible treatment abroad and others with less money have fought legal battles for the right to have treatment. </p> <p>Increasingly, politicians from all sides have begun to admit in recent months that the law includes contradictions and weak points that ought to be changed. </p> <p>But the health minister, Girolamo Sirchia, has said insisted that there is not need to modify it. </p> <p>The campaigners to overturn the law, led by leftwing political parties, scrambled this summer to collect the minimum of 500,000 signatures required to force a referendum. </p> <p>In addition to this petition for a referendum to overturn the law, it is reported that a a further 740,000 signatures have been collected by groups campaigning to keep the existing law but modify its most controversial aspects. </p> <p>Most Italians agree with legislation to stop human cloning, and a poll this summer showed that although 65% of them approve of assisted reproduction, more than 55% do not believe couples should use donated sperm or eggs to conceive. </p> <p>Public opinion is strongly opposed to women being forced to carry up to three embryos at once and being denied the scientific means to establish in advance whether any of them may have defects or genetic diseases.</p>",
  "<b> I'm incredibly aware of, and resistant to, the pressures on women to look good; beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. That said, I'd feel a whole lot sexier if I had bigger breasts. Is it wrong to want to get them done?</b> <p>If you have had breast cancer, or been badly injured in a car crash, or were born a man, breast implants are absolutely acceptable. Otherwise, no. </p> <p>Breast implants are common - in both senses of the word. What they say about you is: \"I am such a tragic victim of our times that I am prepared to accept death or mutilation on the operating table rather than suffer the embarrassment of taking my bra off in bed and revealing to my sexual partner that I do not have the figure of a porn star.\" </p> <p>Surgically \"enhanced\" breasts are so ubiquitous now that it is rare, outside the confines of one's own home, to see normal, unadulterated breasts of the sort that Barbara Windsor once sported in the Carry On films. Some people have begun to labour under the misapprehension that because breast implants are pretty much the norm in Hollywood and TV-land that they are in some way acceptable. But the fact remains that breast implants are a grotesque symbol of how seriously screwed-up this planet is. Add to that this: if you intend to breed, and further to breastfeed, then don't go letting a surgeon at your breasts - they are complex and delicate organs, and too precious to mess with. </p> <p>If you are really worried, buy an expensive bra and keep it on in bed, a la SJP in Sex and the City. </p> <p><b> My father-in-law is a lovely man.

  "<p>Top of the Pops audience members are nothing if not versatile. Five minutes ago, on the last Friday evening in September, they were directing their considerable enthusiasm towards the gym-clad dancers representing Eric Prydz's Call on Me: picture a Jane Fonda workout video reimagined by the staff of Razzle. Now they whoop just as enthusiastically as three thirtysomething men in black perform a song called The Love of Richard Nixon. They clap along as the screen above the Manic Street Preachers' heads shows bombs raining down on Vietnam. Two teenage girls dance together while James Dean Bradfield sings the line: \"People forget China and your war on cancer.\" Of such gratifyingly surreal pop moments is the Manic Street Preachers' career made.</p> <p>\"To release that as a single obviously gives us a bit of glee,\" says bassist and lyricist Nicky Wire. \"I'm attracted by egotistical, megalomaniac, paranoid people. There's a sample on the record where Nixon says, 'I have never been a quitter.' I feel a bit of empathy with that. It's the idea of the ugly duckling. Radiohead are Kennedy, Manic Street Preachers are Nixon.\" He laughs, unfurling his mile-wide grin.</p> <p>Wire is obsessed with history - both the political variety, and that of his own band. His lyrics reveal as much, whether defiant (Masses Against the Classes: \"We're tired of giving a reason why we're the only thing left to believe in\"), or defeated (The Everlasting: \"In the beginning, when we were winning, when our smiles were genuine\").</p> <p>It is the curse of the Manics that they will always be held up against their younger, thinner, more fearless selves. Four working-class intellectuals plotted the perfect band in their bedrooms in Blackwood, Gwent, and launched it, in a blaze of spray-paint, mascara and outrage, with the precision of a military campaign.</p> <p>Then, on February 1 1995, Richey Edwards, their chief lyricist and strategist, left his London hotel and never came back. His still unsolved disappearance is the central tragedy of the Manics' career, and it casts a shadow over every Brit award they've won, every arena they've filled. \"We are haunted by ghosts,\" says Wire. \"We're haunted by the way we looked - the symmetry - the four of us - everything was perfect.\"</p> <p>It's two days before Top of the Pops and the Manics are rehearsing in a studio in an insalubrious corner of central Cardiff. While working late at night, says Bradfield, he has spotted prostitutes plying their trade outside. \"We work better when it's grim,\" says Wire. On the sofa, gnomic drummer Sean Moore is tapping away at a wireless laptop. \"He gets everything in the world before anyone else,\" Wire says admiringly. \"He could have been the Welsh Bill Gates.\" Famously averse to interviews, Moore's off the hook today. \"There's no point,\" he says cheerfully. \"I always say the same thing.\"</p> <p>They run through five songs from their seventh album, Lifeblood. The record's guiding principle was \"elegiac pop\", and the mood is uptempo melancholy: sleek and sad.</p> <p>\"I don't mind if people think this album is quite coffee-table,\" says Wire, folding his 6ft 3in frame on to the upstairs sofa. \"I see that as a compliment. I think White Flag by Dido is a brilliant record.\"</p> <p>Such sentiments sound odd coming from the man so hostile to consensus opinion that he once told a New York audience that the only good thing about their city was that it killed John Lennon, and declared, on stage at Glastonbury in 1994, that someone should \"build a bypass over this shithole\". (\"That's not rational, well-thought-out behaviour,\" he concedes now.) The last time the Manics were palatable to the mainstream, with 1998's This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours, they responded with the messy, contorted Know Your Enemy, an internal psychodrama set to music. \"I think at the end of This Is My Truth we went off ourselves a bit,\" says Wire. \"You know when your favourite band gets liked by someone you really hate? Well the Manic Street Preachers were always my favourite band.\"</p> <p>Whatever Know Your Enemy was designed to achieve - it certainly solved the problem of fair-weather fans - Lifeblood is quite the opposite. The quotation on the sleeve is from Descartes: \"Conquer yourself, not the world.\" \"That's where we are now,\" says Wire. \"Twelve years ago we'd have said, conquer the world and fuck yourself.\"</p> <p>The Manics have always been a band apart. At the height of baggy and shoegazing, they presented a bold, if somewhat cackhanded, collision of Guy Debord and Guns N' Roses. In the year of Parklife and Definitely Maybe, they released an apocalyptically extreme screed called The Holy Bible. So, now that even mild-mannered Travis have discovered protest, it is characteristic that the Manics have recorded their least political album yet.</p> <p>\"I didn't feel under any pressure to talk about Iraq,\" says Wire, who has never worn his politics degree lightly. \"It's a fucking relief, to be honest. Nobody agrees with anything I say anyway.\"</p> <p>Are you driven to go against the mainstream at any cost? \"There's a fatal flaw in us all when it comes to toeing a certain line. I admire Bono, deep down. I'd love to do what he did but I could never be that nice.\" The word hisses out of him. Diplomacy is not his forte. \"If you're an American president you're a cunt. It makes no difference. Bill Clinton is a lovely guy. He has cigars with Bono and Kofi Annan. Does anyone remember Rwanda? Perhaps George Bush would have intervened.\"</p> <p>Nicky Wire's favourite words are future, beautiful and forever, and he now tries to strike them from his lyrics. He likes hotels, sports, TV, reading (poetry, history), writing his potential book (\"It might read like one idiot's rant against everything, but there's room for that\"), the new shed in his Newport garden, and being alone. How many people does he need in his life? He counts them off on his fingers. \"About seven. My wife, my daughter [two-year-old Clara], my mum and dad, brother [playwright Patrick Jones], James, Sean, Martin [Hall, their manager].\"</p> <p>Does he actually like people? \"Most people, when you make the effort to meet them, are a lot nicer than you think.\" He laughs, slightly sadly. \"I never get the impression they think that about me.\" We talk about the television show Curb Your Enthusiasm, which he loves. \"All the comedy I like is imbued with failure, whether it's Basil Fawlty or Larry Sanders. James likes stuff like Cheers.\"</p> <p>During the second half of the 1990s, James Dean Bradfield lived a Cheers-like existence in London: as sociable as his bandmates were remote, he would be out drinking most nights. Back then, Wire and Moore joked about living vicariously through their singer. \"It finished about three years ago,\" says Bradfield, sitting amid amps and instruments in the studio, his fingers rarely without a lit cigarette. \"Even prior to that, if they were living through me, all they'd have got was a bottle of Cutty Sark, some Jameson's, Coca-Cola, ice, cigarettes and pissing on about the same old things at the bar. I think they saw me as being a bit daft.\" Did you feel daft? \"Eventually, yeah.\"</p> <p>The change is due partly to his love life (he is newly married), and partly to a delayed reaction to his mother's death from cancer in 2000. At first, he just drank harder. \"If you were brought up like I was, you try to show you're not scared of it. So you don't turn to tofu or meditation, you just think, fuck you, I won't change a thing.\"</p> <p>It's unusual to see Bradfield so at ease with himself: he no longer screws up his face and fidgets with his lighter while answering questions. He feels happier about the band, too. Tony Visconti, who produced some of Lifeblood, taught them to trust themselves again, instead of second-guessing every move. \"I've let go of people expecting things from us,\" says Bradfield. \"Some people want you to be a cartoon version of yourself forever, and if you can't be that then you've got to split up.\" But the Manics' invigoratingly exact original manifesto was never destined to survive intact. \"At least we broke our own rules,\" Bradfield says. \"They were the most ludicrous rules that there was no way we could ever hold true to them.\"</p> <p>One self-imposed law forbade licensing a song to an advert. Recently, they broke it by allowing the song Australia to promote the Australian tourist board, which Bradfield confesses was \"a knee-jerk revenge\" after years of people criticising their every move. He also regards their much-ballyhooed trip to Cuba in 2001 as \"a failure\", admitting they were naive not to expect a backlash.</p> <p>But Bradfield will not apologise for what some still regard as the Manics' cardinal sin: not breaking up after Edwards vanished. \"Why can't people accept that there was a massive loyalty between us?,\" he says forcefully. \"You know, we weren't left with a goodbye card or a set of instructions.\"</p> <p>Two years ago, the Daily Star reported that a pair of trainers containing bones, possibly those of Edwards, had been discovered in the Severn. \"I think it hurts us a million times more than we would ever let on and even realise ourselves,\" says Wire. Bradfield is more emphatic about the Star's failure to forewarn Edwards' parents: \"Cunts. Fucking cunts.\"</p> <p>This was around the seventh anniversary of the disappearance, when Edwards' family declined to have him officially declared dead. Some commentators reacted with a distasteful mix of voyeurism and gleeful impatience. \"You get that a lot if you're jumping in a cab round here,\" says Wire. \"They say, 'How's that boy of yours, then? You know where he is, don't you?' It's the blankness that you have to deal with. Cardiff Afterlife deals with the feeling of being kept dangling. There's not a body, there's not a grave, but there's hope. You know in Superman, when the baddies expel people from Krypton and they're in bubbles, just floating around? It's felt like that sometimes.\"</p> <p>Bradfield can't stand what he calls \"the B-movie questions\". \"They want him to be stood in front of a TV shop window, with a beard, watching us on TV, saying, 'Good on ya, boys'. Then he walks away back to his fishmonger's job. End of film.\"</p> <p>None the less, he acknowledges that producing a 10th anniversary edition of The Holy Bible, their last record with Edwards, has raised some painful questions. \"Were there things we could have done differently?\" he asks, his brow creasing. \"Definitely. But we were taking all the decisions together at the time. And we were young. It's a cliche but, God, I wish I knew what I know now. I think closure's for people who want to wash their hands of the guilt they feel.\"</p> <p>At the start, the Manics believed fervently in the idea of The Band: an entity that transcended its individual parts. Even with one of those parts missing, they still do. \"Radiohead and Blur and Oasis are a group of individuals,\" says Bradfield. \"Even to Middle England, Thom Yorke is recognisable. But I've heard so many times, 'There's that bloke from the Manic Street Preachers.' I never wanted to be anything else but the bloke from the Manic Street Preachers.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Love of Richard Nixon is out on Epic on October 18.

  "Two companies today face the prospect of \"unlimited\" fines being imposed by an Old Bailey judge after admitting that their neglect contributed to the death of a casual railway worker. <p>Michael Mungovan was struck and killed by a train travelling at 50mph near Vauxhall, south London, just after midnight on October 9 2000 as he and a colleague worked to bring a live electric rail which was out of use to allow engineering works to go ahead. </p> <p>The 22-year-old from County Clare in the Republic of Ireland was earning extra money during his studies at Brunel University in London, and had been hired through McGinley Recruitment Services to carry out work for the Railtrack contractor Balfour Beatty. </p> <p>After his death it was found that his personal track safety certificate was invalid, and his senior colleague, Hamilton Hempstead, had been suspended from carrying out the duties the pair were engaged in at the time of the accident, following earlier safety breaches. </p> <p>Both companies pleaded guilty at a hearing in June to failing in their duty of care under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. </p> <p>Yesterday's sentencing hearing, to be concluded today, heard McGinley had sent out a team of agency workers lacking the necessary qualifications for the work. </p> <p>Neither McGinley nor Balfour Beatty had systems in place to check qualifications, while the acting team leader was \"utterly unaware\" of his duties towards those he supervised. </p> <p>Richard Beynon QC, for the Health and Safety Executive, said: \"McGinley did not know who was turning up, Balfour Beatty did not know who was turning up, nor what qualifications they would have when they got there.\" Mr Mungovan had been sent out with only his suspended colleague to complete a task he had never done before. </p> <p>Counsel for both companies detailed procedural changes which would, they claimed, ensure such an accident could happen to no one else. </p> <p>The jury at the inquest into Mr Mungovan's death in May 2002 returned a verdict of unlawful killing, and a family representative yesterday indicated that a civil case might be brought.</p>",
  "Every autumn since I moved to London seven years ago, I have exactly the same phone conversation with my friends in China - parents whose children are coming to study at universities in the UK and Europe. I would love to tape them, but of course, I haven't been able to persuade anyone. The conversations usually go something like this (me speaking): <p>\"Yes, you can buy duvets and pillows in London. Britain is a developed country; you can get anything you want from the shops here. Yes, even soya sauce and vinegar. In fact, there are at least 10 different kinds of vinegar in the supermarket. Chinese vinegar? Yes, you can get that from the smaller Chinese shops. Fresh vegetables? Not always directly from a farmers' market, but still very good. Live fish? No, you can only get dead fish. The law doesn't allow people to sell live fish. I know, I know what they say - that live, jumping fish is much better for your health ... Is it expensive? Absolutely. London might be one of the great cultural centres of the world, but it is also one of the most expensive cities on the planet. But you can't let your daughter carry everything with her from China ...\" </p> <p>Then, the daughter will arrive with three huge suitcases, a rucksack and an enormous handbag. When I picked one girl up from the airport, the taxi driver asked me where everyone else was, the owners of all the other bags. </p> <p>In the course of two years' study, this girl received further supplies from a friend of her father's, who came to London on business several times a year. </p> <p>Before she went back to China last year, she shipped home two 50kg boxes of clothes, and left a number of brand-new, never-been-used things in my flat: a set of kitchen utensils; a rice cooker; 11 bags of cooking sauce (each of them big enough to cook for 20 people); three big bags of dried mushrooms; 12 bags of dried seaweed; 24 bags of instant soup; 16 bags of dried fish; 12 pairs of chopsticks; six food storage boxes; 22 bars of soap; four bottles of face cream; five bottles of shower gel; four new bath towels; four tubes of toothpaste; six bottles of body lotion; two mirrors; two handbags; 32 pens; 200 envelopes; eight hardback notebooks; three pads of paper ... I'm going to have to stop there, before I run out of room. All of these things her parents would have bought for her in China. </p> <p>This year, I have been talking to the mother of another girl: </p> <p>\"Is the beef safe to eat? Of course it is. Mad cows? Yes, there was a problem a couple of years ago. You've heard a lot of people died of mad-cow disease in England last year - where did you hear that? I read a British newspaper every day, and I've heard nothing about it. You think I'm being deceived by the British media? Come on, we have a proper legal system here. You think Britain is full of terrorists? That's not true. I am here and I don't see that people are living in fear in the way we did in China. Don't send your son to England if you are so worried. Really? He can't get a good job in Shanghai without a western qualification? </p> <p>\"OK, I will try my best to help him. But I won't be able to cook for him and look out for him in the way you would. Yes, of course I know how you feel, I am the mother of a son myself, you know that. But I think the best thing for our sons is to help them to be independent as soon as possible. They can't live under their mother's wings their whole lives. It's not a question of it being the western way of life, and I don't think we should let our children lose sight of their Chinese identity either - we just need to think beyond what's traditional.\" </p> <p>She obviously didn't think I knew what was best for her son. She called me soon after he arrived in London. \"Xinran,\" she said, \"I don't care what you think is good for your son. Right now my son needs you to help him unpack! Can you please make sure he knows how to hang his clothes in the wardrobe? You'd be doing me a big favour.\" </p> <p>I couldn't believe it when her son opened up one of his two huge suitcases and took out pages of instructions on \"how to hang clothes\", \"how to make a bed\" and \"what goes where in your underwear drawer\". </p> <p>\"How did you manage when you were at university in China?\" I asked him. </p> <p>\"My mother visited my dormitory every week.\" </p> <p>If we want our children to grow up and enjoy their own separate lives, we have to let them go a little.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sky Burial by Xinran is published by Chatto &amp; Windus at \u00a314.99.

  "My daughter's father left when she was four. Over the years, he has become increasingly hostile to me. There have been varying degrees of contact between father and daughter. She thrived on regular but limited contact with him last year, but a court order has significantly increased the amount of time she spends with him and his new family. My daughter loves her father but does not want overnight stays - she prefers to be at home with us as she loves my partner and life is very stable here. She does not feel safe with her stepmother. Her father will not consider mediation and does not appear to understand the detrimental effect this ongoing hostility is having on his child. How can I ease the impact of so much negativity on my daughter? How can I protect her and help her to cope? <p><b> No wonder he's hostile</b><br> </p> <p>Is it possible that some of your ex's hostility towards you stems from the fact that he was forced to go to court to gain proper access to his daughter? Bearing in mind the emotional and financial strain of taking an issue like this to court, his unwillingness to attend mediation is hardly surprising. </p> <p>Like it or not, your daughter and her father have a right to regular contact and trying to prevent that is a fruitless exercise. </p> <p>Perhaps you could try slowly rebuilding contact with your daughter's father and gradually getting to know his new partner. The best way to help your daughter is to attempt to alleviate some of the tension that clearly still exists between yourself and your ex. Don't expect miracles, but over time and with effort, it should be possible to develop a friendly and supportive relationship with him, which will enable both of you to prioritise your daughter's feelings. <br><b>EPG</b><br>Newcastle upon Tyne </p> <p><b> Get professional help</b><br> </p> <p>I have taught children in this situation who have also been unhappy for one reason or another about staying in the other parent's house. This can usually be resolved through talking things through with an expert adult who is not personally involved. Is it possible that the problem lies in the relationship between you and your former partner, or could it be the insecurity of his new partner? </p> <p>Your daughter may be one of those children who doesn't like the feeling of \"living out of a suitcase\" and prefers to live definitely at one house and visit the other parent during the day only. </p> <p>Whatever it is, she deserves to be listened to as she is the most important person in this situation. You need to find the right professional as soon as possible and get this situation sorted out.<br><b> KR</b><br> Bridgwater </p> <p><b> He should be flexible</b><br> </p> <p>I was once in your daughter's situation and I understand how distressing it must be for you to see her so upset. As much as I loved and still do love my father, when I was your daughter's age I also found it unsettling at times to see him, not least because I was naturally distressed that he had left in the first place. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that it was important that we stayed in contact after the divorce. It is important that your daughter doesn't feel rejected by either parent and there is a chance that she would if contact with her father was severed. </p> <p>Parents often don't recognise how the upheaval of their relationship breakdown impacts on their children's lives - they have their own emotional distress to deal with at the same time. Sons and daughters caught up in this situation are desperate not to upset either parent. </p> <p>Nevertheless, her father needs to be mindful of the fact that her feelings are more important than his \"rights\" of access; he needs to try to be sensitive to her needs and perhaps a little more flexible as to how and when they spend time together. You are obviously in a difficult position if a court order has to be observed - but your daughter should feel that she is in control as far as who she sees and when. </p> <p>As she grows up and gains more maturity, she should hopefully feel more confident about standing up for herself. The situation may feel intractable at the moment, but please don't lose hope that things will improve.<br>Name and address withheld </p> <p><b> Invite your ex round</b><br> </p> <p>I had similar fears for my daughter when her father and I separated. However, I felt it unhealthy for all concerned that I should carry such thoughts around, as we all had to move on. I tried to understand where my fears were coming from - what had my daughter's father really done, and had I contributed in any way to his unacceptable behaviour? </p> <p>Think about these things and try to reassure your daughter. Arrange to meet her father and her new stepmother and discuss how you can all help your daughter feel safe in terms of visits. Stop worrying and take control of the situation - invite them round and show them your stable life. Surely your daughter's happiness is worth any discomfort such a discussion would involve? <br><b>JW</b><br> Swansea </p> <p><b>Next week</b></p> <p>Since my partner proposed to me life has been nothing short of turbulent.

My partner is from Northern Ireland and moved over here to start a new life with me. However, since announcing our engagement, some people have said that if our wedding was a religious rather than civil ceremony, they would not attend. Some have made us feel they would even go so far as to make life difficult for both of us. </p> <p>I do not want either my partner or myself to be estranged from our family or social circles, but we are getting to the point where we are constantly arguing with each other.

  "<p>Double Olympic gold medallist Daley Thompson today helped launch a scheme in north London to give children an extra two hours' sport a week.</p> <p>If successful, the government-backed Move It initiative, which will benefit more than 1,000 pupils in Brent, could be rolled out nationally.</p> <p>Decathlete Thompson was joined by 2004 Olympic stars Marlon Devonish, Leslie Law, Rebecca Romero and Ali Mowbray to launch the scheme to introduce an extra two hours of sports coaching and physical activity per week for secondary school pupils in the Brent North constituency.</p> <p>The project will run for three years and local Labour MP Barry Gardiner said he hoped it would yield real benefits for health, social inclusion and youth crime; as well as increasing concentration levels and academic performance.</p> <p>Mr Gardiner said: \"There is a health crisis facing our nation. The effects of obesity cost the UK economy \u00a32bn annually in health service bills and lost work hours.</p> <p>\"Eighteen per cent of 15-year-olds are currently obese and the next generation could be the first to regularly pre-decease their parents because their health levels are so poor.</p> <p>\"These facts are disturbing and immediate action is required before the problem develops further. The simple reason why the country is bulging at the waist is that we are not doing enough exercise.</p> <p>\"Through the pilot programme, children will be encouraged to take part in a variety of sporting activities ranging from basketball to boxercise, rugby to dance aerobics. This will ensure that not only are children experiencing a wider range of sporting disciplines but more importantly they will be participating in regular supervised exercise which will result in significant improvements to their health and ultimately their academic performance in the classroom.\"</p> <p>The project is supported by the leading brand name in schoolwear and sportswear, Trutex, which will supply all school pupils with appropriate clothing including polo shirts, shorts, jogging bottoms and socks all free of charge.</p> <p>In the first year of the initiative, pupils from year seven will take part; in the second, year eight will join them; and in the third children from years seven to nine will be involved. By then more than 3,000 pupils will be taking part.</p> <p>The sport will be provided from 4 to 6pm and will dovetail with the government's pledge to provide wraparound care at all schools from 8am to 6pm. For those unwilling or unable to play sport, low impact activities such as dance and drama will be provided.</p> <p>British children play less sport than most other European countries. The scheme's organisers say this has led directly to the alarming increase in childhood obesity.</p>",
  "Four years ago 24-year-old Ricardo Villadiego was walking home after his daily shift at a gold mine in the province of Antioquia in central Colombia. His journey would take two hours through the rolling countryside. Dusk was falling and he was still an hour away from home. <p>As he ambled along a well-trodden path, he stepped on a landmine. Neighbours brought him to the nearest clinic, three hours away by road, only to find that doctors there were inadequately trained to treat him. He recalls having to move from two other hospitals because of the lack of specialist care. It was about 24 hours after the incident that Ricardo was finally able to receive the necessary treatment. His maimed left arm was reconstructed and his right leg amputated below the knee. </p> <p>Ricardo was eventually relocated to the privately funded Bogota-based Integral Rehabilitation Centre of Colombia (CIREC), one of only seven medical centres in the country that treat victims of landmines. After three months of exhaustive therapy, he was fitted with a prosthetic leg. </p> <p>He misses his family, who are 15 hours away by bus from Bogota and anyway too poor to afford the fare. \"But compared with others I'm fortunate,\" he says. \"I didn't die at the scene, I've got a job at CIREC and I receive free treatment.\" </p> <p>Ricardo's story is repeated across Colombia at an alarming rate. Over the past two years the number of antipersonnel mine incidents has increased by 150%. Colombia ranks fourth in the world for new landmine victims each year. Between 1991 and August 2004 the government's Antipersonnel Mine Observatory reported 3,025 landmine casualties. Some 37% of these are civilians - half of them children. </p> <p>Colombia is the only country in Latin America where antipersonnel mines continue to be planted regularly. All illegal armed groups use these macabre weapons of war in the internal conflict between the various guerrilla groups, rightwing paramilitaries and government armed forces. Landmines litter 30 of Colombia's 32 departments. </p> <p>According to Unicef, the largest leftist guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), is the main perpetrator, followed by the National Liberation Army (ELN). For these insurgent groups landmines provide a cheap, effective means of defending captured territory, delaying army offensives and protecting strategic drug and transport routes. </p> <p>\"It's easier to plant a mine than place a soldier on guard duty,\" says Diana Roa, Unicef's humanitarian action area coordinator. Mines are planted near schools and water and electricity installations, \"to instil fear in government troops and terrorise and displace rural communities\". </p> <p>A UN human rights report published in February 2003 said the Colombian army had also continued using landmines, despite the government's ratification of the Mine Ban Treaty of 1997 that prohibited the production and use of landmines from March 2001. </p> <p>The Colombian Campaign to Ban Landmines (CCCM) estimates that there are 100,000 landmines planted across the country. But while the 40-year civil war continues, their clearance remains impossible. </p> <p>\"There's no systematic humanitarian mine clearance activity in Colombia,\" says Ms Roa. \"Even Angola had humanitarian de-mining operations during wartime.\" </p> <p>Mine clearance is difficult because few minefield maps exist. Landmines are planted non-systematically and rarely within a defined combat area. </p> <p>\"There's no culture among insurgent groups of sealing off and marking minefields,\" says Camilo Serna, operations coordinator at CCCM. \"The country's mountainous and tropical terrain only exacerbates the problem.\" </p> <p>Rebel groups favour hechizas (homemade mines) made from plastic bottles and toys, making it difficult for the army's metal detectors and its 450-strong dog detection team to find. The cost of detonating an area further hampers mine clearance. While a hechiza can be made for just $3, it can cost about $1,000 to remove one. </p> <p>\"Attracting foreign investment in mine clearance in Colombia is difficult because of security issues, and there are no guarantees that cleared areas will not be filled quickly again with new mines,\" says Mr Serna. </p> <p>But what most inhibits the work of NGOs appears to be the social stigmatisation of landmine survivors, who are often wrongly associated with participating in guerrilla activities. \"If a civilian suffers a landmine accident, then the assumption is that they were planting it. We've known cases where people claim they've been bitten by snakes so as not to implicate themselves,\" says Leonardo Bernal, a researcher and field worker at Seeds of Hope, a CIREC project involved in mine risk education and prevention in local communities. </p> <p>Rebel groups are suspicious of anti-landmine campaigners. \"Many see our community workshops as an attack against them,\" says Mr Bernal. </p> <p>Such attitudes make it difficult for NGOs to ensure the safety of field workers. But progress has been made in the destruction of Colombia's stockpiles as part of the government's pledge to destroy 23,451 mines by November this year. Since June 2003 the government has destroyed almost half of its stockpile in a series of high-profile events. </p> <p>Unicef says communities that are well organised can play a vital role in reducing landmine injuries by putting collective pressure on local armed groups to mark minefields and to inform inhabitants about their use. Indigenous tribes living in the province of Cauca, on the Pacific coast, have been particularly successful in this approach. </p> <p>Field projects involving awareness-raising training for community leaders also yield results. \"Community leaders pass on the message that it's not safe to walk alone and venture into areas that have seen recent conflict,\" says Ms Roa. </p> <p>Just this week Unicef and CCCM are joining forces with actors and producers of a theatre festival in the western city of Manizales to raise community awareness about landmine. </p> <p>The groups are also working to ensure landmine victims know their rights. Under Colombian law, \"victims of political violence\" can claim state benefits within the first year after an incident. But few are aware that financial assistance exists. </p> <p>\"Many survivors don't receive benefits because they don't have the correct paperwork or can't prove they are mine victims,\" says Mr Bernal. </p> <p>But peace talks between the ELN and the government in August may provide a slight improvement. The ELN has proposed to limit the use of landmines in areas where they are of particular risk to civilians and children. \"The issue has to move from a military problem to a political debate, says Alvaro Jimenez, CCCM's director. \"ELN's proposal is significant because it sets a precedent for the problem of antipersonnel landmines to be a permanent feature on the political agenda.\" </p> <p>While negotiators hope that the precarious peace talks will become a tangible reality, Ricardo's wishes are simpler. \"I just want to go home and see my family again,\" he says.</p>",
  "\"You're a nonentity in this country unless you have a militia,\" says Fakir Mohammed Mohmodzai, the new governor of Baghlan province, 200km to the north of the Afghan capital, Kabul. He knows what he is talking about: he has already had brushes with three military units based in Pul-i-Khumri, the capital of Baghlan province. <p>They are Commander Mustapha's 20th division, Commander Jalal Bushka's 902nd battalion and Commander Amir Gul's 733rd battalion. Although they enjoy official army status, these units are little more than militias. In addition to them, Mohmodzai, who spent most of his career in the Afghan education ministry, says he has to cope with several second-rank commanders in remote areas and with the police, whose recent standoff with soldiers from the 20th division brought tensions to a head in Pul-i-Khumri for several days. When the deputy police chief, Gul Mohammed Mangal, tried to intervene, he was badly beaten up by soldiers. </p> <p>Two and a half years after the establishment of President Hamid Karzai's first government, the Afghans' dream of seeing law and order restored seems remote. The former warlords' militias, which have been promoted to the status of regular army units and placed under the control of the defence ministry, headed by the former commander of the Northern Alliance, \"Marshal\" Mohammed Fahim, are still very much in business - and have lost none of their bad habits. </p> <p>The units are scheduled eventually to be disarmed or, in some cases, reintegrated into the Afghan National Army (ANA) now being formed. But for the time being the ANA has a mere 15,000 men and has not been widely deployed. </p> <p>A portrait of the late Commander Ahmad Shah Massoud still greets visitors from the top of the triumphal arch that marks the entrance to the dusty northeastern city of Kunduz. Here the militias of Jamiat-e-Islami call the shots. The strong man of the region is \"General\" Daud Khan, a former bodyguard of Massoud now in his early 30s, who is the official commander-in-chief of the 6th corps. He rules over four provinces in northeastern Afghanistan. </p> <p>As an ethnic Tajik, he has been running into problems in the province of Thakkar, where Uzbek commanders who were once Massoud's allies have rallied to the Uzbek general, Abdul Rashid Dostum. </p> <p>Karzai has more than once argued that private militias have become the greatest danger facing the country: \"Since persuasion hasn't worked, we'll have to use force.\" In August he again warned the warlords that those who disrupted the disarmament process and imperilled security would be regarded as rebels and severely punished. </p> <p>The warning carried no punch given that Karzai did not direct his threats at those warlords under the formal authority of the defence ministry, which is more than 90% of the militias. The sudden sacking on September 11 of Ismail Khan, the powerful governor of Herat, could, however, mark a turning point in the government's attitude. </p> <p>To have any hope of success in his confrontation with the warlords, Karzai needs concrete and effective support from the international community. </p> <p>\"President Karzai told me that the warlords are not the mujahideen who fought the Soviets and then resisted Taliban and Arab terrorists,\" says General Mohammed Atta, an ethnic Tajik who was recently appointed governor of Mazar-i-Sharif province. And yet those are the men, whose anti-Soviet jihad ended 15 years ago, the people detest because of their constant abuse of power and the unpleasant memories left by their government of 1992-96. </p> <p>\"It's up to the international community to put pressure on the warlords,\" says Mohmodzai. \"It should ask them, for example, where they get their money from. They all own several Land Cruisers worth $45,000 each, but no one asks them how they can afford them.\" </p> <p>In his vast mansion in the centre of Mazar-i-Sharif, Atta is no doubt savouring his latest victory. A former commander of the army's 7th division, he was promoted to the rank of governor after having placed Mohammed Akram, a Pashtun from Kandahar who is the police chief in Mazar-i-Sharif, under house arrest for 18 days. </p> <p>Akram's men had made the mistake of stopping a car driven by men answering to Atta, which was carrying a large quantity of drugs. In the course of the incident, 40% of the newly recruited policemen, who had been trained by foreign instructors, either fled or were kicked out. The remaining 60%, who are in charge of security in Mazar-i-Sharif, \"belong\" to Atta. Atta does not like the term \"belong\". He prefers to say: \"They trust me, like everyone here.\" </p> <p>\"The interior ministry's spokesman said I had authority over the whole province,\" Akram says. \"We'll have to see about that. The militias need to be disarmed. Only then will it be possible to talk of peace and of a central government. Here, 97% of people want a central government, but the militias call the tune.\" </p> <p>Disarmament of the militias is one of the United Nations' principal objectives. To achieve that, it is banking on the cooperation of the defence ministry, which has so far been dragging its feet. The \"commanders\" concerned all agree that they should disarm, but only on condition that the neighbours do so first. </p> <p>Some 12,000 officers and soldiers, out of a total initially put at 100,000, then at 50,000, have so far been disarmed. But to judge from the case of General Mir Alam Khan, the reality is more complex. Alam Khan, who used to head a division of 5,000 men in Kunduz, which has now been slimmed down to 675 soldiers, is not too worried about his future. \u00ecI keep in contact with my men, and I still have a stock of 4,000 heavy weapons. </p> <p>\"They're my property, and the defence ministry has not ruled that we should turn in such weapons. Our conditions for doing so are that the mujahideen should be given jobs and that the situation should have been clarified, which it has not been.\" </p> <p>The almost total failure of the disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation (DDR) programme can be put down to the Tajik domination of the Jamiat-e-Islami within central government - something that discourages chiefs of other ethnic groups from handing over their weapons - and by the fact that demobilised officers and soldiers cannot find jobs. </p> <p>Uzbek militias are still powerful in the region of Kunduz, and there is great rivalry between the Tajiks of Jamiat-e-Islami and Dostum\u00eds Uzbeks. \"Dostum ought to treat me with respect as I have more weapons than he does,\" says Alam Khan. </p> <p>The equation is more complicated in Mazar-i-Sharif, where there are not only Uzbeks and Tajiks, but Hazara Shia Muslims, who also have a militia. \"Karzai didn't keep his promises, and the DDR hasn't done much. Soldiers just turn in their old weapons,\" says Ghulam Khan, a pharmacist in Mazar-i-Sharif. \"Human rights are hardly respected at all here, and there's been a total breakdown of law and order. The most shocking thing is that people are killed in the streets, and no one even asks why or by whom.\" </p> <p>The warlords' main aim would seem to be to hang on to power and to the money that goes hand in hand with it. Most chiefs are involved in trafficking of all kinds, especially drug trafficking. </p> <p>\"In Pul-i-Khumri my men recently seized 390kg of opium hidden in three cars belonging to the 20th military division in the province,\" says Mohmodzai. \"I can prove that the provinces of Thakkar and Kunduz are used as a route for exporting drugs to Tajikistan.\" </p> <p>Mangal says: \"Of course Atta, Daud, Alam Khan and Dostum are involved in heroin trafficking and the European market\", which gets 90% of Afghan-produced heroin. According to Mohmodzai, \"Second-rank commanders encourage farmers to plant opium poppies, and they give them money for that purpose.\" </p> <p>Karzai recently urged that government employees involved in the growing and trafficking of drugs should be identified by the interior ministry, the defence ministry and the national security bureau. Not only is that akin to asking a mafia godfather to denounce his family, but there are so many officials involved that there would be a serious risk of depleting the civil service. Reports suggesting that \"General\" Daud will shortly be appointed deputy interior minister in charge of eradicating drugs trafficking are hardly reassuring. </p> <p>\"We get lots of complaints about people using guns\" says Shamsuddin Hamedi, the Afghan Human Rights Commission representative in Kunduz. \"One man will seize some land, another a house. In one village a commander collected all the inhabitants' voting cards and promised them he would vote on their behalf.\" </p> <p>Hamedi's bureau tries to intervene in such cases, but with no guarantee of success. \"If you have a gun, you can run a private prison - and there are a lot of private prisons in the region,\" says Rassul Ehsan, its programme director. \"The beginning of disarmament in Kunduz didn't change anything, and the presence of a Provincial Reconstruction Team [PRT] didn't affect the situation either.\" </p> <p>Germany operates a 200-strong military-cum-civilian PRT in Kunduz whose job is both to do humanitarian work and to train the police. The British PRT in Mazar-i-Sharif has stepped in to take the heat out of local disputes, but its presence alone is not enough to reassure a population that has lost confidence. </p> <p>It is in that context of gun democracy that a presidential election is scheduled for October 9. In theory it will be followed by a general election six months later. Many fear that any postponement of the general election will allow the warlords to bolster their position. </p> <p>\"The commanders are certainly not prepared to hand over their weapons before the elections,\" says Ehsan. \"It would have been a better idea to organise both elections at the same time, because people here need a strong government as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>What the Afghans most want is a government capable of providing them with security and jobs. They are beginning to despair of getting help from the international community, most of whose promises have so far proved fruitless. And with each new day they feel their future is getting bleaker.</p>",

  "A British citizen being held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay was subjected to \"vindictive torture\" and death threats while in US custody, he claims in a letter published today. <p>Moazzam Begg, from Birmingham, made the allegations in a four-page letter released uncensored to his legal team after being declassified by US officials - a development described by Mr Begg's lawyers as an \"oddity\". </p> <p>The handwritten letter, dated July 12 2004, described the alleged abuse he received at the US military base in Bagram, Afghanistan, prior to his transfer to Guant\u00e1namo and his first contact with a lawyer. He also claims he witnessed the alleged killings of two fellow detainees in US custody. </p> <p>\"During several interviews - particularly, though unexclusively in Afghanistan - I was subjected to pernicious threats of torture, actual vindictive torture and death threats, amongst other coercively employed interrogation techniques,\" the 36-year-old wrote in the letter. </p> <p>\"The interviews were conducted in an environment of generated fear, resonant with terrifying screams of fellow detainees facing similar methods. In this atmosphere of severe antipathy towards detainees was the compounded use of racially and religiously prejudiced taunts. </p> <p>\"This culminated, in my opinion, with the deaths of two fellow detainees at the hands of US military personnel, to which I myself was partially witness.\" </p> <p>Mr Begg, who has been at Guant\u00e1namo for almost two years, also claimed he has been held in solitary confinement since February last year and that, whenever he had signed any documents during his detention, he had done so under duress. </p> <p>He denied any involvement with al-Qaida or any \"synonymous paramilitary organisation\". </p> <p>\"I am a law-abiding citizen of the UK and attest vehemently to my innocence before God and the law of any crime, though none has ever been alleged,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Begg's British solicitor, Gareth Peirce, and his US counsel, Clive Stafford Smith, today published the letter at a central London press conference, and called for the \"immediate repatriation\" of their client.</p> <p>Ms Pierce said: \"Whatever excuses have been given in the past for our government here to not take effective action, now this direct testimony from Guant\u00e1namo compels them to do what they failed to do, which is to achieve his return to this country from his illegal captivity in the US.</p> <p>\"[He is] the one detainee who has not been seen by any of the others. We've had a number of men who returned earlier this year who've said the one detainee they can't describe is Moazzam Begg, and this letter makes clear why. It is that he's been held separately from the others. I would say it's because he's witnessed murder by the US. He has evidence of unlawful killing by the US military, and that evidence is clearly being suppressed.</p> <p>Mr Stafford Smith said the document was released either \"by mistake or because someone in the US has a conscience\". He said it would be deployed in their legal battle to get more information released about conditions at Guant\u00e1namo. </p> <p>\"It gives a flavour of what's really going on down there, and it's scandalous that the US authorities think they can go round torturing people and then classify the evidence of that torture,\" he said.</p> <p>The detainee's father, 65-year-old Azmat Begg, said: \"It is a very heartbreaking sort of letter. He must be a very brave boy, a very strong boy, because no ordinary man could cope with this.\"</p> <p>Mr Begg is one of four Britons being held without charge in the US camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The prime minister, Tony Blair, has personally asked the US president, George Bush, to free the British detainees. The detainees are scheduled to appear before special US military tribunals which will rule on whether they are \"enemy combatants\". </p> <p>Five of the nine Britons originally detained at Guant\u00e1namo were released without charge in March. </p> <p>One detainee, Tarek Dergoul, a 26-year-old former care worker from east London, said after his release that US guards had forced him to look at pornographic magazines and subjected him to \"very loud\" American music during interrogations. </p> <p>Mr Dergoul said he had suffered repeated strip-searches and sleep deprivation. During cell searches by guards wearing riot gear, the soldiers \"poked their fingers in my eyes, banged my head on the floor and kicked and punched me and tied me up like a beast\", he said in a statement released in August. </p> <p>The Britons who, along with Mr Begg, remain at Camp Delta, are Feroz Abbasi, Martin Mubanga and Richard Belmar. </p> <p>In June the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith QC, said he was \"unable to accept\" Mr Bush's proposals for military tribunals at Guant\u00e1namo because they did not meet international standards for fair trials. </p> <p>The editor of Muslim News, Ahmed Versi, said: \"It is about time Tony Blair demanded the release of British Muslims incarcerated at Guant\u00e1namo Bay without charge. It's sad to see that our government has been silent about their torture, even though they have had the information on this for some time now.\" </p> <p>Amnesty International's UK director, Kate Allen, said: \"The US must now bring the shameful situation at Guant\u00e1namo Bay to an end. There should be a full and independent inquiry to establish who is responsible for any ill-treatment, at all levels in the US administration. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\"</p>",
  "<p>European football's governing body today brought disciplinary charges against Hungarian champions Ferencvaros after crowd trouble and racist abuse during their Uefa Cup tie against Millwall. </p> <p>Missiles were thrown during the match in Budapest and Millwall's black players subjected to racist chants by local fans. </p> <p>Uefa's control and disciplinary panel will deal with the case on Thursday, but the hearing will not deal with the trouble in the city centre beforehand which left two Millwall fans in hospital with stab wounds. </p> <p>Millwall chairman Theo Paphitis has made a complaint to Uefa after experiencing some of the missile-throwing himself, while Paul Ifill and Mark McCammon were both targeted with racist abuse by Ferencvaros fans, who have become notorious for such behaviour. </p> <p>Paphitis said: \"It was like going back into the dismal time of football that we all try to forget. </p> <p>\"We could not leave our seats during the game due to the extra police who had to be summoned to protect us.

  "Attempts to release the two French journalists held for over six weeks in Iraq have become enmeshed in new confusion, with the French government expressing fury at the interference of several unofficial French negotiators who claim to be on the brink of securing the men's release. <p>President Jacques Chirac has officially dissociated his government from a self-appointed team of negotiators who this week said they had extracted a promise for the imminent release of Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot and their Syrian driver Mohamed al-Joundi. </p> <p>Yet despite the president's scepticism about the initiative, a member of Mr Chirac's ruling party confirmed the claims of the freelance negotiators and expressed confidence that the hostages would soon be released.</p> <p>As a senior French diplomat made his way yesterday to Amman, the Jordanian capital, for further discussions over how to free the men, officials in the foreign ministry expressed concern over this proliferation of rival negotiators, warning that the presence of several parallel missions working for the release of the three men could jeopardise their own delicate talks. </p> <p>The confusion has caused further unease within the French government, already embarrassed by its precipitate optimism and its numerous public confident declarations of a quick release, which have since proved unfounded.</p> <p>At the centre of the uncertainty is the mysterious figure of Philippe Brett, who runs an obscure organisation lobbying for French business interests in Iraq, the French Office for the Development of Industry and Culture. </p> <p>Although the government has distanced itself from Brett's efforts, Dider Julia, a deputy from the ruling UMP party who has travelled to Syria to help the unofficial negotiators, said that he personally dispatched Brett to Iraq as a freelance emissary and has vouched for his credibility.</p> <p>Brett told French radio today that he was confident that it would be just a matter of hours before the hostages were released. </p> <p>\"I think within 10 hours I can speak with great pleasure,\" Brett said, although he refused to give any further details. \"I don't want to compromise this operation, which is already sufficiently complicated.\" </p> <p>Pierre Girard-Hautbout, an associate of Brett, had been more forthcoming earlier in the week. \"Right now, everything is ready,\" he told Reuters. </p> <p>\"To draw you a picture - everyone is in the car, the suitcases are on the roof, all we're waiting for is the road to be made secure.\" He said Brett had called on contacts built up over 10 years in the region to gain access to the hostage-takers.</p> <p>Another freelance French intermediary, Philippe Evano, based in Damascus, has told French media that the men have been in \"safe hands\" for the past two weeks, but that the American bombardment of the Falluja region of Iraq has hampered practical arrangements for their release.</p> <p>These claims caused bemusement among the French population and triggered considerable irritation within the government. The foreign ministry said it had no knowledge of a deal to free the journalists and that the unofficial missions had created \"more confusion than certitude\". </p> <p>Seeking to clarify the situation further, the president's office issued a statement last night declaring: \"Some people are saying that they have a mission entrusted to them by the president of the republic. It is totally unfounded.\"</p> <p>Chesnot, 37, Malbrunot, 41, and al-Joundi disappeared while travelling to the southern city of Najaf on August 20. Militants describing themselves as the Islamic Army in Iraq claimed responsibility and demanded that France revoke new legislation banning Islamic headscarves from schools. </p> <p>France was dismayed that its journalists had been targeted, having previously hoped that its opposition to the campaign in Iraq would offer its nationals a degree of immunity. </p> <p>France's Muslim community joined foreign ministry officials in rallying an impressive display of solidarity in France and in the Arab world, which prompted the early optimism that the men would be released quickly. The new headscarf law went into effect as planned at the beginning of September.</p> <p>Mr Julia's colleagues claim that he is close to Mr Chirac, but the reaction of the president's office to his initiatives appears to contradict this suggestion. His efforts have left the French media dubious. </p> <p>The highly publicised nature of his diplomacy has raised doubts about its effectiveness. There has also been some criticism of his collaborations with Mr Brett, who used to work as a bodyguard for Bruno Gollnisch, the deputy leader of the extreme right National Front party, which was sympathetic to the former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein.</p>",
  "<p>Centrica, the owner of British Gas, today announced the purchase of Dyno-Rod in a deal that will net Jim Zockoll, the drain maintenance firm's founder, a \u00a349m windfall.</p> <p>The \u00a357.6m acquisition will boost Centrica's home services operation, giving it access to 14m private households relying on emergency call-out services in a market worth more than \u00a3500m a year. </p> <p>It ends speculation about a stock market listing for Dyno-Rod, which employs 131 people at its head office in Surbiton, Surrey, and has 162 franchises offering services from emergency plumbing and locksmith services to pest control. </p> <p>Mr Zockoll, a US citizen who sold his 85% stake in Dyno-Rod, developed it into a nationwide brand after founding it as a plumbing firm in Wimbledon in 1963. </p> <p>The company is this year expected to have generated revenues of \u00a313m, while turnover from its wider franchise operation is forecast at \u00a360m. Pre-tax profits for the year are predicted to be \u00a36m. </p> <p>Mark Clare, the managing director of British Gas, said Dyno-Rod was a \"well-established and trusted brand\" that complemented its services to British Gas customers. \"This acquisition will give us better access to the 14m private households who currently rely heavily on emergency call-out services,\" he added. </p> <p>As well as the provision of plumbing services to households, Centrica said it was investigating the possibility of using Dyno-Rod to provide maintenance services to corporate customers. </p> <p>Details of the deal emerged on the same day that Centrica wrapped up the \u00a31.7bn sale of the AA motoring organisation to two private equity groups.

  "The World Bank and International Monetary Fund get-together taking place this weekend in Washington is one of the great annual gatherings of practitioners of a dismal science. <p>Finance ministers and central bankers from every part of the world, together with their teams of advisers, fill every luxury hotel in the American capital. </p> <p>In formal committee meetings, news conferences, seminars and informal get-togethers on the side, they will review the state of the world economy, map out the road to global poverty eradication and provide strategic direction to the twin pillars of the international development system. </p> <p>The meetings can have a restrained, technocratic air. This is strange, given the scope of the agenda and the scale of the international financial institutions' ambitions; the bank's slogan under its PR-savvy president, Jim Wolfensohn, is: our dream is a world free of poverty. Odd, too, amid the intense controversy generated by the institutions' loan conditions, </p> <p>The events are covered by a relatively small number of financial journalists, while the big protests of recent years are no more. The security around the bank and fund buildings on 19th Street may be tighter than ever - with a cordon extending two blocks in every direction, set up over the weekend. </p> <p>But this has more to do with al-Qaida than anti-globalisation activists. Indeed, the mounting costs of protecting a meeting room full of G7 finance ministers have led to the meetings being compressed this year. Both the development committee, whose remit covers the bank, and the international monetary and financial committee, which covers fund business, meet on the same day. </p> <p>The agenda for the IMFC, which is chaired by Gordon Brown, the chancellor, and assisted by Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, includes the global economic outlook (positive for most places outside Africa), the IMF's role in the poorest countries and a review of the \"IMF quotas, voice and representation\". </p> <p>The last item sounds obscure, but isn't when you realise the IMF and its sister bank operate on a \"one dollar, one vote\" basis. This gives almost total dominance to the north Americans, Europeans and Japanese. Britain, France and Germany each have their own seat on the board. Close to 1 billion Africans in 46 countries must settle for just two seats between them. </p> <p>Democratic it isn't. Everyone recognises the problem, but almost no one who can effect change seems keen on relinquishing control. </p> <p>One small shaft of light may come from Hilary Benn, the UK international development secretary, who sits on the development committee. I was told by one British official that Benn is frustrated enough by rich country procrastination over governance reform to \"do a Khruschev\" and bang his shoe on the table, which could be interesting.</p> <p>More substantive progress is possible on three other issues where the UK is taking a lead. </p> <p>First, Brown has proposed a scheme to cancel all the debt owed by the poorest countries to the fund and the bank, through extra aid money and sales or revaluation of the IMF's huge gold reserves - currently undervalued by $35bn (\u00a319.5bn). </p> <p>While a deal is unlikely this weekend - not least because the US has an alternative plan on the table - France and Canada are interested in the proposal. It is likely to be taken forward next year during the UK's chairing of the G7 group of industrialised nations. </p> <p>Second, the international finance facility, the chancellor's idea for doubling aid to poor countries to meet the UN's millennium development goals in 2015, will get the green light from the fund and the bank in a joint feasibility study released over the weekend. </p> <p>This will raise Britain's hopes of winning sufficient backing from other donor countries to launch the IFF at the G7 summit in Gleneagles next summer.</p> <p>Finally, the UK government will also launch a position paper on aid conditionality. This is the practice of requiring countries to undertake policy reforms, such as trade liberalisation and service privatisation, in exchange for aid money. </p> <p>Presenting the new paper, Benn will call for fewer conditions linked to structural economic change and a focus instead on basic financial accountability. It represents a significant challenge to how the bank and the fund operate in poor countries. </p> <p>For all the talk about \"ownership\" and \"partnership\", research by non-governmental organisations - and by the financial institutions' own evaluation departments - shows that loans and aid continue to be used to leverage controversial policy reforms that have often increased, not reduced poverty. </p> <p>If progress is made on all three of these issues, the meetings - which often produce little beyond lofty sentiments, coupled with inaction - will have proved a success. They will have laid a solid foundation for a major push on international development during 2005 when Britain not only chairs the G7, but also holds the presidency of the European Union.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Patrick Watt is Action Aid's senior policy officer</p>",

  "<p>Every time Francesca lies down and has her ballooning stomach covered in gel for a routine scan, she looks at the strip light on the ceiling of her clinic in Sardinia and says a silent thank-you to a local female judge. </p> <p>A few months ago, this 24-year-old mother from a village in the rugged Sardinian hills came close to a nervous breakdown. Two and a half months into a pregnancy, she discovered that one of the twins she was carrying had a genetic illness, thalassemia or \"Mediterranean anaemia\". But when she and her husband decided to remove the unhealthy embryo, they were told they would be committing a crime. </p> <p>Under an Italian law on assisted reproduction passed earlier this year, their only options were to keep both children or abort them both. And abortion would only be legal if it was carried out within the following two weeks. </p> <p>Francesca and her husband Luca's seven-year-old daughter was already living with thalassemia, common in Sardinia, and they knew what it meant. Fortnightly blood transfusions for life. Daily injections. Violent mood swings. </p> <p>\"It was a very hard decision,\" says Francesca, after a check-up with her gynaecologist, Dr Giovanni Monni, at the Ospedale Microcitemia in Cagliari. \"For the child, and for us, living with thalassemia is like a prison sentence. I'll admit it, we just couldn't face doing it again.\" </p> <p>But they had no intention of aborting both embryos. The couple were desperate. As the deadline for legal abortion approached, Luca stopped going to work. Francesca was sick with anxiety. They began making plans to have the foetus removed legally in London, when a local judge ruled against the state in their favour. The two-minute embryo reduction operation would not be a crime, the female judge said, as it was necessary to protect the mother's mental health. </p> <p>The same judge ruled against the state in another case, that of a petite young woman from Palermo, barely four feet tall, who faced serious health risks if she gave birth to triplets; she, too, was able to remove one foetus. The woman had undergone IVF treatment and, under another clause of the disputed fertility law, doctors were obliged to implant three embryos at a time. </p> <p>These two are among the few known cases of Italian couples who have won legal rulings that favour their personal circumstances over the rigid legislation passed by parliament in March, giving the embryo rights equal to that of a woman. </p> <p>Dr Monni, a leading Italian fertility expert, is one of the few doctors who has taken practical steps to expose the contradictions and weaknesses inherent in the legislation. While he cannot risk his job by breaking the law, he has encouragedpatients to seek legal rulings that allow him to give them the treatment they need. </p> <p>Under the existing law, forced through parliament to plug a 30-year legal vacuum, embryos have gone from being at the mercy of maverick doctors to having armour-plating. All forms of cloning and embryo research are now illegal. Only three embryos may be made in vitro at a time and all three must then be implanted at once. (There appears to be no clear scientific reasoning behind the three-embryo rule. Instead, it is a kind of political compromise, designed to balance the needs of older and younger women in a single rule.) Embryos may only be screened by the naked eye for genetic diseases or defects before implanting, and once implanted must be treated equally, regardless of abnormalities. Doctors face fines of up to \u20ac600,000 (\u00a3400,000) and a three-year suspension if they break the law. </p> <p>The potential pitfalls were evident before the legislation was passed. The three-embryo rule increases the risk of multiple pregnancies for young women, and reduces the chances of women in their 40s becoming pregnant at all through IVF. </p> <p>In the five months following the introduction of the law, the success rate for IVF treatments dropped from one in four to one in nine. But rather than turning to the courts, most of the estimated one-in-five couples who need science to help them conceive have simply given up trying, while others have headed abroad to escape the law. </p> <p>Stefania Prestigiacomo, the minister for equal opportunities, has been one of the more vocal critics of the law from within the government. \"Effectively, it discourages people from turning to fertility treatment to get pregnant,\" she says, speaking from her unglamorous Rome office where small children are occasionally found playing in the corridors. \"There are some errors that need to be corrected. There is no doubt that some aspects of this law are against women.\" </p> <p>Others put it more bluntly. \"It's as if we are weirdos, social outcasts,\" says Federica Casadei, who runs a Rome-based support organisation for couples with fertility problems called Cercaunbimbo (Looking for a child). \"If you are sterile, the state doesn't want you. And it doesn't help you. The embryo is so sacred now that you cannot touch it, not even to help it be born.\" </p> <p>Cristina Zuppa, a younger mother whose attempts at in vitro fertilisation have so far failed, says: \"This law is made by people who have no idea what it is like not to be able to have children. They are dictating to the nation on the most private of things. It's like being told what clothes you are allowed to wear.\" </p> <p>Emma Bonino, the MEP and former EU humanitarian affairs commissioner, says that it is not that Italians have gone back in time with the new law, more that they have crossed the Tiber river and become \"citizens of the Vatican\". While Italians proudly cohabit with the Holy See and the vast majority are nominally Roman Catholic, when it comes to practical questions about family life, they tend to respectfully ignore the Pope. Some of the most valued legislative milestones in recent Italian history have been the legalisation of divorce (in 1970) and abortion (in 1978), wanted by the vast majority and opposed by the Vatican. </p> <p>Over recent months, the fertility law has revived this tension. Roman Catholicism ceased to be the formal state religion in 1984, so who exactly makes the rules - the people or the Pope? It has also opened deep wounds for those who believe that Italy is run for men by men, be they politicians in limousines or priests in purple robes. </p> <p>\"I'm a Catholic and so are all my family,\" says Francesca at the Cagliari clinic. \"But we believe you have to be realistic and do the right thing in some situations. Not what the Pope says. I think the men who make the laws [in Italy] don't have a clue what our reality is.\" </p> <p>When the fertility law was voted through parliament, after 30 years of stalemate between traditional Catholic-thinking legislators and their opponents, the health minister Girolamo Sirchia said it was \"a good start\" towards protecting the embryo. \"Research should be carried out on animals, not Christians,\" he said. </p> <p>The law was passed by leftwing figures, too - their religious beliefs overriding any natural instinct to oppose Berlusconi's government. And although many were aware that there were weaknesses in the legislation, there was some collective relief in government that finally a law - however flawed - had been passed. Maverick doctors such as the controversial Severino Antinori could no longer claim to have cloned human beings, or help women over 60 conceive. </p> <p>But the law met with outcry from scientists, including fertility expert Carlo Flamigni, and Rita Levi-Montalcini (who won the Nobel prize for medicine in 1986). The pair issued a joint statement, describing it as \"astonishing from a scientific point of view and disgusting from a moral point of view\". </p> <p>Six months on, it looks as if the legal experiment has failed. Public opinion has been moved by the traumas the law has imposed on people like Francesca and Luca and there have been calls for the health minister, Girolamo Sirchia, to resign. Yesterday, campaigners announced that they had gathered more than one million signatures - double the 500,000 signatures required to call for a referendum on either modifying or abolishing the law. Two recent polls have shown that over half of respondents would vote to abolish the law. </p> <p>The health minister has so far shown no sign of wanting to revise the more contested parts of the law. His office did not respond to repeated telephone and written requests for an interview. </p> <p>\"None of us were elected for our religious beliefs,\" says Prestigiacomo, the Catholic equal opportunities minister, who supports many but not all aspects of the law. \"We do not have the right to impose our beliefs on others. Italy is supposed to be a secular state. It's a pity there is resistance [within government] to changing parts of the law. It means there is a real danger the public will vote to abolish it altogether and we'll be back to zero, where we were 30 years ago.\" </p> <p>Now that a referendum seems likely to go ahead, it looks as though the government's attempt to regulate fertility treatment may have been one of the country's shortest-lived laws. </p> <p>\"It's an important day for women in Italy,\" campaigner Barbara Pollastrini of the Democrats of the Left said yesterday. \"It is a yes to hope.\"</p>",
  "It is not the sort of announcement generally associated with supermarkets. Those passing Costcutter in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, may have expected to be told of cut-price custard creams or deals on bacon. <p>But instead of the latest bargain, shoppers met with somewhat indelicate references to unexpected parental anatomy. </p> <p>As they passed the shop they were greeted by the refrain: \"Your mother's got a penis.\" </p> <p>It was not the musing of a particularly disgruntled supermarket worker but rather the lyrics of the forthcoming single by the Welsh rap band Goldie Lookin' Chain, who happened to be shooting their video inside the store. </p> <p>But some shoppers were unamused by the words of the band's latest offering, and one woman complained to the police that decency laws were being flouted. </p> <p>After finishing the video, the band member Mystikal said: \"The police have been down on several occasions due to public decency laws. They haven't been happy that we've been going on about penises and cocks.\" </p> <p>After a chat with the band, Hertfordshire police decided not to take any action. </p> <p>A spokesman said the production company had told them it would be filming in the supermarket, but they had decided to investigate after a complaint about the song's lyrics. He added: \"We sent a unit down to request that the company turn the music down, which they did, and we continued to monitor the shooting during the day.\" </p> <p>On their last video shoot - for Guns Don't Kill People, Rappers Do - the band were spoken to by the police after being caught smoking cannabis.</p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday October 7 2004</b> <p>We say in the article below that the EU has taken command of the Nato-led peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Afghanistan. While this is true for Bosnia, the Eurocorps headquarters - which recently took charge in Afghanistan - reports to Nato, although it is available both to the EU and Nato.</p> <p></p> <p>The European Union's fledgling effort to develop its own military force is slowly taking shape on the dusty streets of the Afghan capital. But in the mounting insecurity which plagues the country as presidential elections approach next week, it is unlikely that many Afghans have noticed. </p> <p>So is it a case of great things having humble beginnings, or that nothing has really changed since August, when the five-nation Eurocorps, led by France and Germany, replaced Nato in commanding the international United Nations-mandated contingents who patrol Kabul? </p> <p>Tall, heavily-armed white men in flak jackets, tramping past crowded bazaars or rumbling in armoured cars through the heaving traffic of painted lorries and ancient taxis - who spots the difference between the EU and Nato? </p> <p>By the end of the year the EU will also have replaced Nato in charge of peace-keeping in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The same riddle of recognition will apply there, too, even though these two missions are touted as the most significant steps yet taken to put teeth into Europe's security and defence policy. In fact, they are both postwar, peacekeeping operations on a very classic model. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the EU's military activity has been more innovative, at least in terms of the mission's purpose. The EU went briefly into Macedonia to forestall a civil war at the initiative of the two main ethnic communities' leaders. Last year, with a UN mandate, it protected civilians and put an end to massacres and rape in the eastern Congolese region of Ituri. </p> <p>There was nothing here about regime change or mopping up after war. The troops were there to protect civilians and prevent disaster, or in the Congolese case, to put a stop to it. The EU has also organised two police missions to help local law-enforcement in the Balkans, and one in Georgia. </p> <p>The EU recently set up a command centre to plan European military-civil operations. In recognition that police are a key component of postwar nation building and conflict prevention, there is talk of creating a European gendarmerie. </p> <p>Yet, as the EU builds up a capability for military action, questions remain over the doctrine which its forces will follow. Are they simply pooling units from national armies under a joint EU command? Is it a mini-Nato with a European face, the much-vaunted European \"pillar\" of Nato, finally standing erect? Is the new force to have a different or just a separate approach from the Americans? </p> <p>At their Brussels summit last year EU governments agreed on a security strategy which went far beyond the issue of Europe. In contradiction to the appalling idea of Europe authorising asylum seekers' detention camps in north Africa, which European home affairs ministers are discussing again this week, it recognised that fortress Europe is unworkable and immoral. \"The post cold war environment is one of increasingly open borders in which the internal and external aspects of security are indissolubly linked,\" the strategy document says. </p> <p>Implicitly rejecting the Bush concept of military pre-emption, it calls for \"preventive engagement\", by which it means European action to help countries return to democracy, or build it, before military threats arise. </p> <p>How this can be done systematically is fleshed out in an important and imaginative new report, A Human Security Doctrine for Europe. Set up by Javier Solana, the European foreign minister, whose job was created under the new European constitution, the report's drafting committee was convened by Professor Mary Kaldor of the London School of Economics. </p> <p>The report avoids the issue of the EU's relationship with Nato, and whether EU security activities should complement or substitute for Nato. Nor does it get into the self-flattering debate about the United States as Mars and Europe as Venus. It points out that Europe's posture is just as Martian and outmoded as that of the United States. \"Europe has 1.8 million people under arms, but only a fraction can be deployed in crisis zones. Europe needs to be able to deploy more police, human rights monitors, aid specialists, and many other kinds of civilian expertise,\" it says. </p> <p>The report's core is a set of principles to guide EU military-civil missions. The first is the primacy of human rights. It is not enough that an intervention be legal. The methods adopted must be appropriate since protection of civilians is an end in itself. Under the doctrine, for Europe to adopt tactics like the current US airstrikes on Iraqi cities would be wrong and counterproductive since excessive use of force inflames a situation. </p> <p>More radically, the report calls for a bottom-up approach. Decisions about whether and how to intervene must take account of the views of the people affected by violence and insecurity. Once established on the ground, missions have to provide for consultation, dialogue, and partnership with local people. \"International interventions can never be more than enabling. There is a tendency among internationals to assume they know best. Conventional attitudes have too often been to do it for them or to work with weak or criminalised leaders,\" the report says. </p> <p>In a similar spirit, the report says that if the EU is going to act as a \"norms-promoter\" abroad, it has to conform to clear legal standards itself. There should be common rules of engagement for EU troops, and all deployed personnel should be subject to enforceable sexual codes of conduct, as well as the domestic law of the host state. The scandal of prostitution and child abuse, exacerbated by claims of immunity or blind-eye-turning by mission leaders, has tarnished too many international operations, whether run by the UN or Nato. </p> <p>The report calls for a \"human security response force\" of 15,000 people, of whom a third would be police and civilian specialists. Around 5,000 should be ready to deploy within days. There would be a civil-military crisis management centre in Brussels to provide early warning by keeping in touch with NGOs and monitors on the ground. </p> <p>These proposals offer a genuine alternative, which go a long way towards solving the spot-the-difference riddle. Whether the report is acted on will largely depend on Javier Solana, its sponsor. He is already recruiting staff for what will be one of the commission's largest departments. </p> <p>Giving direction to this giant bureaucracy will require strong determination and a willingness to change the ethos of the top-down Nato and United Nations interventions of the past. Far more than the conventional goals of improving airlift capacity or ensuring national weapon-systems are inter-operable, Europe needs brain and sensitivity if it is to be respected as a new global player. </p> <p> Javier Solana's report is on <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global  \">www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Half of all current undergraduates chose their university based on the quality of the nightlife, according to a poll by the University of Hertfordshire published today. </p> <p>The revelation will come as no surprise to university admissions tutors, but may be bad news for the researchers' own institution, which is sited in the small town of Hatfield - not noted for its clubs.</p> <p>They interviewed a targeted sample of 136 undergraduates and recent graduates and found that the 'kudos' of the university was important for 60%, the facilities for 57% and even the quality of the shopping was a crucial factor in deciding where to go for a fashion-conscious 15%.</p> <p>The research also identified increasing concerns among students about the cost of university living. For students who graduated under the pre-1998 system of paying no fees at all, an area's cost of living and being close to home were only cited as reasons to study at a university by 19%. </p> <p>For students graduating under the current fees system, cost of living was a reason for choosing a university for 28%, while 35% wanted to live at or near home.</p> <p>While the perceived quality of the course was important to almost all students, past and present (82%), only 26% of students chose their university on the basis of the subject alone. Indeed, 11% of potential students were so impressed with the social atmosphere of their prospective university that they would have changed subjects to study there.</p> <p>Despite the importance of the course to students, a third (34%) did not attend an open day at the university they eventually selected. Of these, 17% were disappointed by their university, a level almost three times higher than among those who did attend an open day.</p> <p>The main reason given (by 28% of those who didn't attend an open day) for being disappointed in their university was the quality of the teaching.</p> <p>Dr Stephen Boffey, dean of interdisciplinary studies, said: \"While it is good news that students are choosing universities based on a whole range of factors, it is crucial that they attend an open day to check out the quality of a university for themselves.</p> <p>\"That 28% who didn't attend an open day were disappointed in the quality of teaching doesn't surprise me - open days are a crucial way of determining if you feel the teaching staff will be able to meet your expectations.\"</p> <p><strong>TOP TEN FACTORS INFLUENCING UNIVERSITY DECISION</strong> </p> <p><strong>Current undergraduates </strong> </p> <p>1.

  "<p>Microsoft was close to a deal with the European Commission earlier this year which would have revealed more of its secrets than it has now been ordered to hand over, a court was told yesterday. </p> <p>The US software group is attempting to get the European court of first instance to suspend the commission's ruling that it is violating anti-trust law, which would force the company to reveal its software code to rivals. </p> <p>In March, the commission found that Microsoft used the power of its Windows operating system, which it said held virtual monopoly in personal computers, to cripple competitors and ordered the company to change the way it does business. </p> <p>Court president Bo Vesterdorf must decide whether to delay the enforcement of the order pending Microsoft's appeal, a process which could take several years, or allow it to be implemented at once. </p> <p>Microsoft, which was fined a record \u20ac497m in March, has consistently argued that the EU decision would cause it \"irreparable harm\" by allowing rivals such as Linux and Novell to effectively copy its unique server technology. </p> <p>They in turn argue that the group is abusing its virtual monopoly in desktop operating systems by making it impossible for competitors supplying rival servers to inter-operate with Microsoft systems. </p> <p>Brad Smith, the US software group's counsel, told the court yesterday the two sides had virtually reached a settlement in early March. \"We were prepared to go further and make concessions that are outside the scope of the [Brussels] decision,\" he said. </p> <p>Senior commission officials confirmed that the US group had been ready to go further and seized on his admission as undermining Microsoft's case that it would suffer \"irreparable damage\". </p> <p>The final stumbling block is believed to be the commission's demand that an independent trustee monitor the disclosure of the secret protocols in servers. </p> <p>Microsoft's advocate, Ian Forrester QC, described this as \"the commission's private sheriff\". </p> <p>Mr Smith said: \"We were prepared to enter into an agreement even though at the top of the company we did feel it would result in harm in some areas. We would have avoided a fine and three or four years of litigation.\" </p> <p>Earlier, Microsoft's smaller rivals urged the court to uphold an immediate implementation of the EU decision or risk finding that the US group had extended its monopoly through the planned launch in 2006 of its latest Windows version. A final court hearing on Microsoft's appeal is likely after that date. </p> <p>Jeremy Allison, co-founder of Samba, which is closely linked to Linux, derided Microsoft's claims that its server protocols were a multi-million investment. \"They're valuable because they're kept secret and that prevents competition.\" </p> <p>Accusing Microsoft of simply adding \"tweaks\" to known technology, he said his company had been given access to the protocols in the 1990s - before the US company had established its monopoly - but this had been withheld with Windows 2000. </p> <p>\"We will fall only further behind if these remedies imposed by Brussels are delayed.\"</p>",
  "My colleague Ian Gibson MP rang me at 6.30am from his hotel in Ramallah on the West Bank. Our visit to study healthcare in occupied Palestine was about to take a personal and frightening turn. Ian had been taken ill with a suspected minor stroke. The specialist came quickly and Ian was dispatched to hospital in Jerusalem in a Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance. <p>But at the al-Ram checkpoint, Ian's ambulance was stopped by Israeli border police. Despite his obvious ill-health - he was dry retching - and representations from the British consulate, the ambulance was refused permission to go any further. For 70 minutes Ian was left in the ambulance before he was allowed to proceed in a different ambulance, needlessly called. </p> <p>The callousness of his treatment was a clear breach of Israel's promise to the UN that ambulances should never be held up for more than 30 minutes. A Palestinian voluntary organisation, HDIP, has logged 83 deaths when access to emergency carehas been denied; 52 women have given birth at checkpoints after being refused access to hospital. </p> <p>Road closures and checkpoints are a part of the systematic occupation of Palestine that goes well beyond the securing of borders. According to the UN , there are more than 700 checkpoints, blockages and closures throughout the West Bank, controlling the movement of every Palestinian inside their own country. While we were there, most Palestinians were forbidden to move outside the major towns. Palestine is increasingly de facto divided into a series of isolated communities under military control. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the West Bank security wall goes up apace, as does the encroachment of settlements. It was extraordinary to stand in the village of Saffa, on the Palestinian side of the 1967 border, and see the new towns spreading like Spanish timeshare developments. The new townships will be ringed by the new wall, while Saffa will be on the \"wrong\" side. Its residents will have no clear right to leave their village, and will be subject to arbitrary removal of their residence permits. Israelis will have every opportunity to settle the same land. </p> <p>Whatever security function the wall may have, its real effect, snaking deep into Palestine, is clear. Before long, too little Palestinian land and freedom will remain to make an independent state a viable proposition. </p> <p>What happens if the two-state solution founders in a failed Palestinian state or the simpler brutality of continued Israeli occupation? We and other EU taxpayers will carry on picking up the aid bill - already higher per head than any other country in the world - for mitigating the worst consequences of Israel's illegal occupation. Meanwhile our own security, and the credibility of British foreign policy, will suffer. </p> <p>The hope of a two-state solution has united those whose sympathies have been with either side, and those who take no side but simply recognise that our own security depends on a just solution in the Middle East. Supporters and opponents of the Iraq war agreed that peace in the Middle East was essential to undercut the emotive appeal of al-Qaida to alienated Muslims. Speaking in March 2003, Tony Blair said: \"All of us are now signed up to ... a state of Israel, recognised and accepted by all the world, and a viable Palestinian state. That is what this country should strive for, and we will.\" </p> <p>Again this week, Tony Blair said: \"Two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace, would do more to defeat terrorism than bullets can ever do.\" He promised he would make it a personal priority after the US presidential election. So how should that priority be demonstrated? </p> <p>Now is the time to be braver and bolder about the pressure we can apply. Our government did not want the case against the wall to be heard in the international court of justice, arguing that it would not help the peace process. But external pressure does work. The clear condemnation by the court has shocked Israelis and their government and forced some rethink on the line of the wall. </p> <p>Israeli policy can be influenced by a clear external challenge. Many people are already questioning whether Israel's preferential trade agreement with the EU, which depends on that country's human rights record, can still be justified. Such options should not be lightly dismissed. </p> <p>Of course, every obscene suicide bomb obliterates the wider picture; ordinary Israelis have a right to security too. But current Israeli policy won't bring long-term security for them and it casually threatens our own. If it takes external pressure to bring that message home, we should be prepared to use it. </p> <p>As the situation in Iraq deteriorates, the moment for Tony Blair to give real force to his promises has come. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Denham is Labour MP for Southampton Itchen; he was a Home Office minister until he resigned in March 2003 over the Iraq war</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:denhamj@parliament.uk\">denhamj@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The government hopes that changes to the Employment Act 2002, which comes into force today, are aimed at reducing the number of employment tribunal claims. Not everyone likes today's changes. Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the TUC says the new procedures are \"too complicated, and are more likely to create confusion than solve workplace problems\". But whether or not they cause more problems than they are worth, the new laws could change the way you and your employer work together.</p> <p>\"This is one of the most significant changes in employment law in recent years and is likely to have major consequences for employment relations in the workplace,\" says Tessa Fry, a partner at Orchard Solicitors in London. \"The legislation applies to all employers regardless of size. However the new procedures apply only to employees, not to other workers such as freelancers or subcontractors.\" </p> <p><strong>Making your voice heard</strong></p> <p>If you are unhappy with something at work and cannot resolve the matter informally, you may wish to raise a grievance in a more formal way with your employer.

If you do not follow these procedures, you may not be able to make a claim in an employment tribunal at a later stage. </p> <p>\"Employees will no longer be able to use an employment tribunal to bring a claim against their employer unless they have first tried to resolve the dispute in the workplace,\" says Ms Fry. \"This is particularly relevant for discrimination claims,\" she adds. </p> <p>The SGP requires you to inform your employer in writing of the basis of your grievance. This is called a Step One letter. The employer is required to respond within a reasonable time, and to invite you to attend a meeting to discuss the grievance. </p> <p>Once the decision has been made and you have been notified about it, you must be given an opportunity to appeal and you must inform your employer if you do not wish to do so. After the appeal meeting, the employer must inform you of his decision, known as the final decision. </p> <p><strong>Getting satisfaction</strong></p> <p>If you are still not satisfied and think that your employment rights have been infringed, you can make a claim to an employment tribunal. However, the tribunal will not accept your claim unless you have previously put the grievance in writing to the employer, and 28 days has passed since the date of the Step One letter. The exception to this rule is when the grievance is about dismissal. </p> <p>If you do not use the SGP to address your complaint then things will get far more difficult for you. You will be required to persuade the employment tribunal at the start of proceedings that the claim should be allowed to proceed, even if you have left the organisation. </p> <p>\"In many circumstances, failure to follow the SGP may mean you are barred from bringing a tribunal claim,\" says Ms Fry. \"But even if the employment tribunal allows your claim to proceed, any failure on your part to comply with the procedure will mean a decrease in the compensation award of between 10% and 50%. On the other hand, where it is the employer who fails to comply with the SGP your award will be increased by between 10% and 50%.\" </p> <p>If you have already left the company you still need to pursue a grievance but can use a shorter two-step procedure known as the modified procedure, which omits the meeting. </p> <p>Where you have been subject to harassment and have reasonable grounds to believe that putting a grievance in writing would lead to further harassment, you do not need to follow the SGP.</p> <p><strong>Them against you</strong></p> <p>The rules around disciplinary action against staff are changing too. If an employer is contemplating taking disciplinary action against you on grounds of conduct or capability, or dismissing you, they must follow the Statutory Disciplinary Procedure (SDP). This means that an employer has to give you written notification of the offence. The employer must then invite you to a meeting discuss it, and you have a duty to attend this meeting. \"You have the right to be accompanied by a work colleague, or a trade union official,\" adds Ms Fry. </p> <p>Following the meeting, you have the right to appeal against the decision - though you must inform the employer of this. The employer must then arrange an appeal meeting. If, following this meeting, you disagree with the employer's decision you can make a claim to an employment tribunal. </p> <p>\"Employers will no longer be able to use the 'clear your desk approach' to dismissal without paying higher compensation,\" says Ms Fry. \"If an employer dismisses you without following the SDP, an employment tribunal will deem the dismissal to be automatically unfair, and will increase compensation. If you fail to follow the SDP, your compensation will be reduced by between 10% and 50%.\" </p> <p>The SDPs are minimum procedures that need to be followed in addition to any existing procedures covering verbal or written warnings. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> For further information contact <a href=\"http://www.acas.org.uk\"> The Advisory, Concilliation and Arbitration Service </a> or the <a href=\"http://www.dti.gov.uk\"> Department of Trade and Industry </a></p>",
  "<p>After completing his eighth symphony, Maxwell Davies declared publicly that it would be his last, and that chamber music would be his main preoccupation for the foreseeable future. His first major project is the set of 10 Naxos Quartets; the fourth and fifth will be heard in London for the first time later this month, while this release launches the cycle on disc. It's a promising beginning: Nos 1 and 2 are large-scale works (30 and 45 minutes respectively), which are very different in tone and suggest that Davies is still finding fresh expressive territory to explore.</p> <p>The First is in three movements, the last of them very concise, while in the Second two massive movements enclose a pair of much shorter ones. There are classical models in the background, but the language is very recognisably Davies's own.</p>",

  "<p>Oxford University is hoping to bolster its appeal in the north by offering scholarships to rugby league players.</p> <p>The university's rugby league club has launched a scheme to make two scholarships, worth \u00a31,000 a year, available from 2005 for students who play the quintessentially northern game.</p> <p>The scheme, which is being backed by the Rugby Football League, is the idea of Oxford student and last year's club president Matt Scaife. </p> <p>\"I hope the scholarships will help to counter the misconception that most Oxford students are southern, former public school pupils, and that the costs of studying at Oxford are prohibitive to those from lower-income families,\" said Scaife. </p> <p>The scholarship scheme is a first for rugby league at any university and is the only open-application sports scholarship at Oxford to be awarded before entry to the university.</p> <p>\"Sport is a great social leveller - no matter what your background is, no matter how talented you are, you can only reach the top by applying yourself and training hard. I believe education should be exactly the same,\" said Scaife.</p> <p>\"I hope these scholarships will help to ensure individuals with the academic ability and an interest in rugby league are not dissuaded from applying to Oxford University for financial reasons or because they simply don't think they'll fit in.\" </p> <p>Ruth Collier, spokeswoman for Oxford University, said: \"We are keen to encourage everyone who has the academic ability and the interest to study here to have a go at applying and not to think that this is not for them.</p> <p>\"The students who are at Oxford are the best ambassadors for the fact that there is an inclusive and varied group of people studying here.\"</p> <p>A steering group of prominent rugby league supporters has been established to create a scholarship endowment fund of \u00a3300,000. A spokesman for the Rugby Football League said: \"People from all walks of life play rugby league, as this Oxford University scheme demonstrates. Across our universities the student game has been a success for a long time.</p> <p>\"Oxford University is by no means the best rugby league team in the country but they have a famous name and this gives the success of rugby league in Britain's universities an added resonance.\"</p> <p>The RFL has a dedicated student officer who works to develop interest in the sport in universities. \"Many rugby union players find that university is their first chance to get involved in the game,\" he said.</p> <p>Organisers at Oxford University say the scholarships will not be limited to just male rugby league players and coaches. Qualified physiotherapists of either gender will be considered. </p> <p>Rugby league has been played at Oxford for almost 30 years, and this year the club will compete in its 25th annual varsity match against Cambridge. Applications for Oxford University close on 15 October and Rugby League scholarship forms must be received by 1 December. The forms can be found at <a href=\" http://www.ourlfc.org/scholarship\">www.ourlfc.org/scholarship</a></p>",
  "<p>Tom Waits has made a career out of doing precisely the wrong thing. While the Beatles invaded America, he attempted to get a job as a Sinatra-style crooner at a San Diego golf club. As San Francisco turned psychedelic, he travelled to Haight-Ashbury with the intention of becoming not a hippy, but a be-bop-fuelled beatnik. When the US became dominated by the 70s west coast sound - cocaine-numbed faux-country about takin' it easy - Waits was to be found growling mournful piano ballads in which drunken low-lifes without a dime in their pockets cursed their luck while staring at the hookers through the neon-lit diner window.</p> <p>With stadium rock and synthesisers to the fore in the early 80s, Waits took it upon himself to meld the dadaist blues of Captain Beefheart with raddled oompah music that would have been considered the height of fashion in Weimar republic-era Germany. Ten years later, popular culture threatened to catch up with him - you could discern his influence everywhere from Quentin Tarantino's films to the music of PJ Harvey - but the prospect of being in step with the times appeared to send Waits completely crackers: cue 90s albums full of punishing industrial noise and visions of apocalypse.</p> <p>Given his history, it is somehow unsurprising to discover that Waits considers 2004 an apposite moment to abandon his piano and begin human beatboxing. There was something distinctly underwhelming about imitating hip-hop rhythms with your voice when Doug E Fresh came up with idea in the early 80s. Twenty years on, it's the province of irredeemably naff boy band members and nutcases on The X Factor. Wilfully anachronistic as ever, Waits launches into it with gusto, huffing and puffing away amid the squawking blues guitar and the squeal of son Casey's turntables on Real Gone's opening track, Top of the Hill. The effect is merely cranky and impenetrable, but by the time we reach a song called Metropolitan Glide, he has refined his technique into something impressively horrifying. His impersonations of drums now come interpolated with tortured guttural hacking noises. He sounds like a man trying to regurgitate a particularly hairy pork scratching, an image somehow given greater plausibility when you learn that Waits recorded his vocal rhythms in his bathroom.</p> <p>Musically, Real Gone is as eccentric and obtuse as ever: quite aside from Waits's human beatboxing, the album features 11 minutes of muffled dub reggae (Sins of My Father) and a sort of Afrobeat sea-shanty (Hoist That Rag). Lyrically, however, it seems curiously direct. In the past, Waits has described his albums as \"movies for the ears\" - works of invention in which he inhabits purely fictional personas. On Real Gone, Waits's language is as rich and strange as ever - he remains perhaps the only writer in rock who can send you scuttling for a dictionary without instilling in you a deep and profound desire to slap him - and there's plenty of yarn-spinning on offer: on Circus alone, we come across characters called one-eyed Myra, Yodelling Elaine, Funeral Wells, Poodle Murphy, Mighty Tiny and Horse-Face Ethel and Her Marvellous Pigs in Satin. Frequently, however, the lyrics take on oddly contemporary resonances. Voices protest that they are merely obeying orders, or that God alone will judge their actions. Weapons keep cropping up, wielded by people who are hopelessly out of control (in Don't Go Into That Barn, someone called Everett Lee goes on the rampage while sozzled \"on potato and tulip wine\", something only a character in a Tom Waits song would ever consider tasting, let alone getting drunk on). Sins of My Father is not the first Waits lyric to mention gambling, but there are enough pointers in the imagery to ensure that the listener realises the game is taking place in Florida and the cards are marked with hanging chads. \"Smack dab in the middle of a dirty lie, the star-spangled glitter of his one good eye,\" growls Waits to one of several deceptively pretty melodies buried amid the chaos. \"Everybody knows that the game was rigged, justice wears suspenders and a powdered wig\".</p> <p>There is plenty that is remarkable about Real Gone. There are dense concoctions of unlikely musical influences. There is line after line of hugely entertaining opulent imagery. But most remarkable of all, there is the closing Day After Tomorrow, an unadorned song about a soldier writing home: \"I'm not fighting for justice, I am not fighting for freedom, I am fighting for my life and another day in the world\". Its power comes not from sonic shock value nor pertinence to current events, but from its uncanny sense of timelessness: it sounds like it could have been written at any point in the past 50 years, without seeming in any way hackneyed, an incredible trick to pull off. As the song and the album ends, you are left more certain than ever that Tom Waits is entirely out on his own.</p>",
  "A mere 514 years after 16 pages of the Sforza Hours were stolen by a murdering Milanese duke, the British Library has reunited one of its greatest treasures with the last of the three missing pages known to survive. <p>The tiny page could not be more topical: a man and woman hunting on horseback, in the golden month of October. Behind the glittering image lies a story of greed and treachery. </p> <p>The couple may be an idealised Bona of Savoy and her murdered husband, Duke Sforza of Milan. The page certainly ended up in the hands of her brother-in-law, chief suspect in the killing not only of the duke but also of his son. </p> <p>Before Bona's book of hours had even been bound, 16 illustrations were stolen - a monk, acting for the murderous in-law, is blamed. </p> <p>But it was not a time to stop and ask questions: Bona, also sister-in-law of the King of France, fled the court with what was left. </p> <p>October is the 1490 work of Giovan Pietro Birago, most famous artist in the princely state of Milan, more highly regarded and paid than his contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci. </p> <p>Only three of the 16 are known to survive, and the British Library now has them all, thanks to \u00a3131,000 from the Art Fund charity toward a price of \u00a3191,000. </p> <p>The book was given to the library in 1893. It has 16 superb 16th-century Flemish replacements commissioned by Margaret of Austria. The first lost page, Adoration of the Magi, was presented in 1941. In 1984 May was acquired. The final leaf was offered through a dealer. </p> <p>May and October spent most of the 20th century in in Switzerland: on some disastrous day both were dropped, shattering glass of the 19th-century frames directly onto the fragile painted surface;it is now too risky to take the pictures out of their frames. </p> <p>The library still hopes more pages may turn up; but like May, October has disastrous water staining on the reverse: the 10 other months, of one of the most exquisite calenders ever created, may simply have been washed away.</p>",
  "<p>There was a rumour circulating a few months ago in various scurrilous gossip magazines (which, obviously, I only ever read at the dentist's and never buy) that Demi Moore was considering having liposuction on her knees. At the time, I felt an enormous sense of awe: Moore had managed to find perhaps the only part of the body about which women did not feel insecure. Well done, Demi, your career has not been in vain. </p> <p>But it now appears that, far from being a fully paid-up resident of La La Land who has spent too much time at the plastic surgeon perusing the catalogue, Moore may well be blessed with the prescience of an astrologer. The future is going to be hugely unkind to anyone with less than perfect knees because the biggest trend for next spring/summer is not florals, not even bright colours. It is shorts. </p> <p>The good news is that they are not hotpants. The bad news is that they are somehow even worse: long, straight down to the knees, sometimes even a bit tapered. Yes, exactly the kind that we make fun of American tourists for wearing. Although, this being fashion, they are not (sadly) called \"American tourist shorts\" but have been given the somewhat improbable name of \"city shorts\", last seen around 1989. And, yes, the idea seems to be that they should be worn with heels. </p> <p>Prada, Nicole Farhi, Clements Ribeiro, Pucci, Proenza Schouler and Caroline Herrera have all featured city shorts and heels in their spring/summer collections; Marc by Marc Jacobs and Missoni rolled their shorts up a little higher. Even lovely Diane von Furstenberg, a woman whose raison d'etre has always been to make women look good, opened her show with a pair of city shorts. </p> <p>Obviously, just because a dozen or so designers put shorts on the catwalk does not necessarily mean we will all be wearing them come next July. But women can be persuaded collectively to wear the darnedest of items. Currently, for example, ponchos are appearing across the land, purely because women seem to think wearing one will make them resemble that blonde girl who goes out with Jude Law and not, as this paper's fashion editor put it, \"literally, a wet blanket\". And I doubt if I need to remind anyone of last winter's plague of Uggs - who would have thought that Geri Halliwell, of all people, could persuade so many that looking like a goblin was a good thing? </p> <p>Worse, this is a look that can be particularly easily, ahem, \"adapted\" by the high street. Even I, who once defended the concept of designer denim, find it difficult to imagine any woman spending more than \u00a3300 on a pair of shorts at Harrods when she could get a remarkably similar pair for \u00a330 at, say, Gap, which has been churning them out for aeons. \"Oh yes, we shall certainly be stocking lots of different types of shorts next summer,\" a spokesperson for Gap confirms happily. </p> <p>This apparent sudden trend for shorts confirms my long-held, but rarely provable, theory that the two greatest evils in an otherwise sensible woman's wardrobe are (a) \"directional\" fashion and (b) Ibiza. </p> <p>With regard to the former, much-vaunted fashion trendsetters, such as Chloe Sevigny and Sarah Jessica Parker, have recently been photographed in shorts and heels and this, inevitably, has been taken as a good tip. While we should all branch out into something other than a T-shirt and jeans from time to time, surely every woman, no matter how directional she may pride herself on being, just wants to look good. Yet city shorts do few people any favours, managing to thicken the knees and dwarf the legs in one fell swoop. </p> <p>As for Ibiza, over the past three weeks I have seen one too many collections bearing the strong imprint of a designer who had a little too much fun on holiday this summer, and decided somewhere between San Antonio and Hoxton that what they wore while hanging out with Jade would make a smashing spring/summer wardrobe (cow-hide print hotprints? a glitter-speckled cape?). Too many women seem to take the same approach, mistaking what they wore on holiday for a sensible wardrobe at home. Hence the gravely unfortunate rise of the kaftan in certain areas of west London, overly moneyed suburbs and Chessex as a whole. This makes the threat of shorts next summer all the greater. </p> <p>We can probably blame Marc Jacobs for this shorts trend because he included them in his last spring/summer collection. Then, they were loose and rolled halfway up the thigh. Fashion critics came over all literary, claiming these shorts were all part of Jacobs's new \"Great Gatsby style\" and \"lazy days in the Hamptons look\". In other words, they were part of a designer's theme - which is all very well, but is no help to a woman who just wants to find an item that suits her, as opposed to paying \u00a3350 for a pair of sodding shorts. </p> <p>\"Oh yes, we sold out of those Marc Jacobs shorts last summer,\" a spokesperson for Harvey Nichols says brightly, before adding, \"Mind you, only two were sold at full price. The rest had to go in the sale.\" So will Harvey Nichols be restocking city shorts next summer? \"I think it's fair to say that our buyers will be cautious. The high street will just rip them off and you have to be a 16-year-old stick insect to look good in them.\" </p> <p>Designers, bless them, are all very keen to find new ways for us all to wear clothes. But too many of them get carried away in this pursuit and float off on the clouds of their own concepts, forgetting that if it does not make a woman look good, she is not going to show the money. And \"city shorts\", lifestyle name and all, smack decidedly of a concept. </p> <p>But sneery cynicism is never a good look - it is possibly an even worse one than city shorts and stilettos. After all, Prada convinced us all that bowling shoes were quite the dernier cri, so shorts should prove no problem for it, and knee liposuction will be next year's Atkins. Demi, I salute you.</p>",
  "In the unlikely event that any in the hand-picked audience at last night's Gucci show in Milan were unaware that this was the first show under a new designer, they probably would not have guessed. <p>All the Gucci elements - the bondage-tight satin and split pencil skirts, the deliberate flashes of bare skin contrasted with the needle-sharp stilettos - were in place. </p> <p>The distinctive Gucci showmanship was as evident as ever in the Martini trays beforehand, the dramatic lighting, the glitter shower finale. </p> <p>But the audience were, one and all, acutely aware that this was the first show by Alessandra Facchinetti, successor to Tom Ford, the designer who steered Gucci to success before leaving in the spring. Indeed, many of the same front row were in tears as they said goodbye to Ford on this very catwalk six months ago. </p> <p>But confusingly, the point is that this was not really Facchinetti's first show for Gucci at all. She has been design director of Gucci womens wear for four years. </p> <p>Ford worked on several different labels and his role was one of guidance and editing; Facchinetti's job description has changed little, except that this guidance has been removed. The million dollar question in the world of luxury brands is, is Gucci still Gucci without the Midas touch of Ford? </p> <p>On the evidence of last night's show there's no doubt Facchinetti can make clothes sexy enough to satisfy even the rapacious Gucci customer. </p> <p>This was easily the tightest, most body-conscious collection of this Milan fashion week. But any designer has to perform a balancing act, being true to the brand but also to what feels modern, and the satin drainpipes, while classically Gucci, did not look like anything women want to wear right now. </p> <p>Elegantly constructed corset tops, waisted jackets and tight skirts in divine damson and coffee silks were beautiful but, again, a little too much of a homage to the Ford era. It was almost as if Facchinetti were still trying to create a collection that would please Ford, and that is no longer the point. </p> <p>Where Facchinetti came into her own was in eveningwear. Chiffon cocktail dresses, with seams of transparency traced around the body's curves between arcs of metallic beading, had that elusive, catch-your-breath, I-want-that-now quality that makes a brand take off. </p> <p>When Ford was in control of Gucci, the images of the designer and the label blended into each other. Handsome, smart and charming, Ford was a walking, talking symbol of his brand. </p> <p>When he stepped on to the catwalk at the end of one of his shows, he looked the ideal male counterpart of his models. This was what made him so valuable to Gucci; but towards the end, it was also what made the owners of the business view him as a potential liability. </p> <p>Facchinetti could be a media-friendly face for the brand: she is young (32), with a dark, rock-chick look. But to date she has kept a low profile. Some say that this is because she is a very private person; others say that she would like fame but her bosses do not want another superstar designer on their hands.</p>",

  "<p>British Energy today announced a quarterly loss of \u00a3115m, weighed down by operating and one-off costs. </p> <p>BE, which is preparing to delist its shares as part of a government-backed debt restructuring programme, said its performance in the three months to June 30 had been affected by lower than expected output from its eight nuclear power stations. </p> <p>The group was also unable to fully benefit from the recent sharp rise in electricity prices because it had sold most of its output for the coming year in advance, at fixed prices below current market value. BE, the UK's biggest power generator, had anticipated a drop in prices.</p> <p>\"The overriding concern of British Energy was to reduce the group's exposure to potential falls in the market prices of electricity,\" the firm said in a statement. \"Therefore, the company sought to sell forward virtually all of our planned generation. As a result, it has not fully benefited from the more recent rises in market prices.\" </p> <p>Seasonal repairs and unplanned stoppages of more than 14 days at Sizewell B, in Suffolk, Torness, in East Lothian, and Heysham, in Lancashire were blamed for the weaker nuclear output figure, which was down 12% at 15 terrawatt hours.</p> <p>In June, BE showed signs of some trading improvement, reporting pre-tax profits of \u00a3232m in the year to March 31, compared with losses of \u00a34.3bn a year earlier. Today's first quarter results - the first time BE has published figures for the period - included UK operating losses of \u00a336m. </p> <p>BE also said it was making progress with its planned restructuring, implemented after it almost went bust in 2002 due to falling power prices. </p> <p>The programme yesterday received a boost when Polygon Investment Partners gave up an attempt to derail it. Polygon and another institutional investor had called a special meeting of shareholders after claiming that the planned debt for equity swap, which will hand control of the group to creditors, would leave them with an inadequate stake. </p> <p>BE said the agreement - recently backed by the European commission - was the only option open to it, adding that it would face administration if the proposals were blocked. </p> <p>The restructuring plan, drawn up in October 2003, involved banks and bondholders agreeing to write off \u00a31.3bn in debt in return for control of the group.</p>",
  "<p>There is a truly terrifying photograph of Diego Armando Maradona, dating from 2000, the year of his first heart attack. He is wearing: a reversed baseball cap which reveals a squirt of hair, dyed the punk colour of baby shit; dark glasses; a drummer's sleeveless T-shirt, giving full play to the tattoo of Che Guevara on his right shoulder; and a defiant, slack-mouthed sneer. Then you come to the massive emplacement of the gut. </p> <p>It would be hard to exaggerate the ubiquity of the diminutive (-ito, -ita) in Latin American Spanish, which originates from the extreme reverence and indulgence accorded to the young. You are always coming across grown men with nursery names - strapping Sergitos, hefty Hugitos (and I'm friends with a 60-year-old called, simply, Ito). But it would choke you, these days, to call Maradona \"Dieguito\". The figure still frequently seen, on television, wobbling through airports or wedged into golfcarts, has his old hair-colour back, and is more soberly dressed; yet his bulk remains prodigious and unignorable. It visibly tortures him. And you can still glimpse Dieguito, walled up in his new carapace, pining, suffering - but unresisting. Inside every fat man, they say, there is a thin man trying to get out. In the case of Maradona, it seems, there is an even fatter man trying to get in. </p> <p>Maradona's autobiography, El Diego, was about to be published, and there was talk, down here, of his giving an interview in Buenos Aires (I happened to be in the neighbourhood: Uruguay). When he suddenly decamped to Cuba, his second home (or sanatorium) since 2002, I blithely followed. Maradona had already had a drug-induced heart attack in April, true; but it was put out that this particular trip was routine - a dryout, or a decoking. A man describing himself as his agent, a Dieguito-shaped youngster called Gonzalo, received me at his hotel, and we seemed to be moving cautiously forward. I got my answer the next day, on the news. The doctors - Fidel's doctors - at the Centro de Salud Mental were emphatic. The patient was wired up like an astronaut, and would be seeing no one. Maradona retired in 1997. In 2001, he played (rather tubbily, I admit) in a televised football match. Now, in 2004, he needs medical permission to watch a televised football match. He is 43. Dieguito - where did he go? </p> <p>*** </p> <p>In South America it is sometimes said, or alleged, that the key to the character of the Argentinians can be found in their assessment of Maradona's two goals in the 1986 World Cup. For the first goal, christened \"the Hand of God\" by its scorer, Maradona dramatically levitated for a ballooned cross and punched the ball home with a cleverly concealed left fist. But the second goal, which came minutes later, was the one that [England manager] Bobby Robson called the \"bloody miracle\": collecting a pass from his own penalty area, Maradona, as if in expiation, put his head down and seemed to burrow his way through the entire England team before flooring Shilton with a dummy and stroking the ball into the net. Well, in Argentina, the first goal, and not the second, is the one they really like. </p> <p>For the Argie macho (or so this slanderous generalisation runs) foul means are incomparably more satisfying than fair. \"It's the same in government and business. They don't just tolerate corruption. They worship corruption.\" It is a proclivity that extends into the sexual arena, with the high value assigned, in macho circles, to heterosexual sodomy - something noticed in his travels by VS Naipaul and, more surprisingly (this was in the 1920s), by Jorge Luis Borges, who thought it the essence of the cult of \"taking advantage\". In Maradona's personal lexicon, the same word does duty for both goalscoring and fornication. (The word is \"vaccinate\": an odd choice, given that Diego was so often the pre-match recipient of the six-inch painkiller needle, driven into the inflamed kneecap, the supporating big toe.) By this logic, the second goal against England was a languid, erotic epiphany; the first was a knee-trembler in a back alley; and each has its points. More broadly, there is in this culture a humiliation, an abjectness, in always playing by the rules. </p> <p>By the time we reach the England game in El Diego, the reader is in any case wholly seduced by the story and by the turbulent naivety with which Maradona tells it. To begin with, the passions involved were not merely ludic: \"In the pre-match interview we had all said that football and politics shouldn't be confused, but that was a lie. We did nothing but think about that. Bollocks was it just another match!\" And it wasn't just the Malvinas, either: it was the revancha of a subjugated and immiserated population. So, having exulted at length in the second goal (\"I wanted to put the whole sequence in stills, blown up really big, above the headboard of my bed\"), Maradona turns his attention to the first: \"I got a lot of pleasure from the other goal as well. Sometimes I think I almost enjoyed that one more.\" And the reader can only assent, by now, to the contented urbanity of his conclusion: \"They both had their own charm.\" </p> <p>In other words, all's fair - all's sweet - in love and war. And, for some reason, that's what football is, and those are the energies it calls upon: the energies of love and war. </p> <p>*** </p> <p>It was a childhood without insulation, in all senses. If the society had its sicknesses, then nothing stood between them and Dieguito. \"Everyone goes on about role models. Role models my arse! In Argentina we don't have a single living role model so stop breaking my balls about it.\" The beautiful game was a way out of the slums, but it was hardly a beacon of probity for the growing boy. Football was as corrupt and rapacious as everything else. Here (it was well known) was a league where players had to bribe the manager to get on the team sheet - where Patrick Vieira, say, has to slip a bung to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger or else languish in the reserves. </p> <p>Maradona's Buenos Aires barrio was Villa Fiorita (\"little bloom\"), a festering wilderness in the 1960s (and, these days, a Saddam City of weaponised crime). \"My parents were humble working folk,\" he writes, but the stock phrase is barely adequate. All 10 Maradonas occupied a three-room lean-to where the only running water was the torrent that came through the roof (\"you got wetter inside than out\"). The obsession with football seems utterly innate; no memories precede it, and no other interests compete with it. When the infant Diego ran errands, he did so playing keepie-uppie with an orange. When he was three a cousin gave him his first leather ball (\"I slept with it hugged to my chest\"). And when he went for his first trial, aged nine, he was so advanced that the coach seriously suspected that he was a midget. He made the senior side at 15, and with his first wages he bought another pair of trousers, to supplement the turquoise cords with the big turn-ups. </p> <p>His ascendancy, thereafter, was perfectly designed to detach him from reality - and reality, then, included the Dirty War and the terror and the 30,000 desaparecidos [disappeared]. At the age most kids hear stories, read one headline, he hears ovations. Three months after his debut he was training with the national team, up against Daniel Passarella and Mario Kempes. At 18, after a win over US Cosmos, he swapped shirts with Franz Beckenbauer; at 19, he scored his 100th goal. He was already the face of Coca-Cola, Puma, Agfa. </p> <p>Marginal and relatively impoverished, South American leagues act as a training and recruitment ground for the clubs of Europe, and in 1982 Maradona duly moved to Barcelona for $8m (\u00a34.4m). When he went to Napoli two years later he was on $7m a year, plus $3m from Italian television (there was also $5m from Hitachi). An International Management Group poll named him \"the best known person in the world\", and he was offered $100m for his \"image rights\"; he turned it down, for patriotic reasons (IMG wanted him to take out dual nationality). 1986 brought him his nationalist apotheosis: he captained Argentina in the World Cup, and they won it. He was 25. </p> <p>El Diego is a transparent narrative, and you keep seeing in its interstices a startling inner chaos - acute and chronic flaws of character and judgment, and above all a self-knowledge that remains persistently absentee. When Maradona was 14 he fell under the sway of his first manager, an old mentor with the unencouraging name of Jorge Cyterszpiler. You can see it coming when, early on, Maradona boasts that they \"handled everything on the basis of friendship, not a single piece of paper was signed\". Sure enough, when he arrives in Naples 10 years later he bewilderingly reveals that, \"Cyterszpiler had had such bad luck with figures that I was down to zero\". Or less than zero. Cyterszpiler's bad luck with figures, his investments in Paraguayan bingo halls and the like, additionally devoured Maradona's slice of his transfer fee together with his 10-bedroom house in Barcelona. \"What's done is done,\" shrugs Diego, insisting that every investment (every bingo hall) was the result of his own decisions. Much later on, when Maradona undertakes a fitness drive, he hires a trainer: Ben Johnson. \"Yes, Ben Johnson! The fastest man on earth, whatever anyone says.\" </p> <p>It is the same with the Camorra - the Mob - in Naples. \"They offered me things but I never wanted to accept them: because of the old dictum that first they give and then they ask ... whenever I went to one of those clubs they gave me gold Rolexes, cars.\" He didn't \"want\" to accept them; but he accepted them. It is the same with fouls, and referees. When Maradona forms a judgment, you feel you are watching one his \"mazy runs\": \"That bastard Luigi Agnolin, the Italian ref, wrongly overruled one of my goals. I never stamped on Bossio, no way. I beat him because I jumped over him. It was never an intentional stamp ... that Agnolin, he was a fucker. We tried to pressurise him from the start but the Italian wasn't a man to be intimidated ... He pushed Francescoli, he pushed him! He even elbowed Giusti. I liked Agnolin ...\" </p> <p>Maradona's anarchistic streak also reveals itself in his contempt - no, his disgust - for the law. On the occasions when he attracts the attention of the police he can barely bring himself to say why. \"I was arrested, arrested!\" he says, and briefly describes the ensuing \"farce\"; meanwhile, with a polite cough, a footnote steps in to divulge the charge (possession of cocaine). Later, back in Argentina, after being incessantly doorstepped, \"I reacted ... I reacted in the way anyone might. It was the episode with the air rifle, yeah, that's right.\" And again the footnote, itself evasive, adds that this was the \"affair\" when Maradona fired an air rifle at congregated journalists, without adding that he hit four of them and received a suspended three-year sentence. </p> <p>Then, too, there are frequent glints of what one might call exceptionalism - or low-level megalomania. Maradona routinely refers to himself in the third person, not just as Maradona (\"We made him bigger than Maradona\", \"That's the most important thing Maradona can have\", and, amusingly, \"The drug trade is far too big for Maradona to stop it\"), but also as El Diego: \"Because I am El Diego. I too call myself that: El Diego\"; \"Let's see if we can get this point across once and for all: I am El Diego\"; \"I am the same as always. I'm me, Maradona. I am El Diego.\" After a while it stops sounding like self-aggrandisement, and starts sounding like self-hypnosis. </p> <p>Passarella was \"a good captain, yes\", El Diego allows, but \"the great captain, the true great captain, was, is and always will be me\". This form of words finds an echo, later on, in 1996, when Maradona launched a national anti-drugs campaign by saying, \"I have been, am and always will be a drug addict.\" The 12-stepper's mantra, usually a mock-humble boast of hard-won continence, feels in this case more like a statement of irreducible truth. Maradona has been using drugs for 20 years: it resulted in a 15-month ban (in Italy), ejection from the 1994 World Cup (\"I was given [sic] ephedrine, and ephedrine is legal, or ought to be\"), and a career-ending scandal on his swansong return to Boca Juniors in 1997. The habit, after all, can no longer be described as recreational. This is a man who regularly snorts himself into a cardiac arrest. It seems that only a life-threatening debauch can recreate the intensities - the heart-bursting highs, the abysmal lows - of his vanished pomp. </p> <p>This is an operatically emotional book, and also an exceptionally vivid one. The exoticisms of the Maradona idiolect are balanced by the oath-crammed cliches of football, which would appear to be universal (\"the crowd went mental\"; \"that wanker\"; \"sorted\"; and manager Carlos Bilardo's nicely implausible \"Leave it out, Diego\"). But there are intimations, too, of a stronger level of perception. Pre-match funk in the changing-room: \"I felt a silence, too deep, too cold. I looked out at some faces and saw them pale, as if they were tired already.\" A bad injury: \"I sprinted after a lost ball and I heard the unmistakable sound of a muscle tearing, like a zip opening inside my leg.\" As for the emotion, Maradona cries himself a river on every other page. And the prose poems to his wife and to his family are all the more affecting because you know that he is now divorced, and estranged from both his brothers; and because you know that the ties of love have not been able to hold him in his orbit. </p> <p>Many sportsmen claim to be champions of the people, but Maradona's populism is underwritten by his itinerary - the proletarian strongholds of Buenos Aires, Naples, and now Havana (and the only French club he flirted with, indicatively, was Marseille). In BA, if you ask around, the response to Diego is always thoughtful, always sympathetic; and the Havanans, who have never known a non-decadent Maradona, seem to be unreserved worshippers (\"I am Maradona fanatic\"). Cuba is perfect for him; he can be a man of the people and a man of the president, hobnobbing with that other world-class scapegrace, Fidel Castro. </p> <p>The great player Jorge Valdano said a good thing about Maradona, and in the Latin high-style: \"Poor old Diego. For so many years we have told him repeatedly, 'You're a god', 'You're a star' ... that we forgot to tell him the most important thing: 'You're a man'.\" But we're not quite there yet. In Italy they used to tell him, \"Ti amo piu che i miei figli\" - I love you more than my own children. It's not as blasphemous as it sounds. With his tantrums, his self-injuries, and his unassuageable sweet tooth, Maradona has remained \"El Pibe d'Oro\", the child of Gold; he is still Dieguito. </p> <p>\u00a9 Martin Amis 2004</p>",
  "<p>Durham University's undergraduate timetable is in crisis with large sections incomplete just days before students are due to return for the start of term.</p> <p>Admin staff are working round-the-clock to produce a functioning schedule after the university last week pulled the plug on a project to computerise timetabling. </p> <p>Two years ago the university purchased a software package, Syllabus Plus, to save time and money. But the project has been in difficulties for several months. An administrator hired by the university for the project has been absent on sick-leave since mid August, apparently through stress. Durham's academic registrar, Nicola Parker, admitted there were \"major problems\" with the new timetable. </p> <p>Beginning in late July, a succession of half a dozen impractical and unworkable timetables were generated by the software until, ten days ago, a glitch in the data settings emerged as the root of the problem. The error meant that, for courses with more than one lecture a week, individual lectures were treated as options from which a student would choose only one to attend. Such a set-up is common-place in US and Australian universities, where lectures are repeated several times to accommodate much larger student numbers.</p> <p>Members of the university worked with Scientia - the company which makes the software - to correct the mistake, but were unable to regenerate the timetable automatically once it had been corrected. Departmental timetable coordinators then worked frantically to resolve clashes by hand, before the university took the decision to pull the plug and revert to last year's timetable.</p> <p>With up to a hundred new modules introduced across the university since last year, administrators are left with just a few days to carry out and check the necessary modifications before term gets under way.</p> <p>Asked whether she thought the timetable would be ready for the start of term, the university's head of student planning and assessment, Melanie King, said: \"It has to be ready. We're aiming to have everything done in time.\"</p> <p>Departmental timetable administrators remain sceptical, however: \"Ten days ago, I received an email telling me that virtually all of the problems had been ironed out,\" said one. \"I decided to check two modules at random and found both had clashes. Further investigation revealed a total of more than 60 other clashes.\"</p> <p>Many academic staff are reportedly unhappy at not being able to confirm commitments, such as dates for meetings and seminars, whilst the timetable remains in limbo: \"Several of the organisations that I have had to explain the situation to are surprised to say the least,\" said one disgruntled lecturer. The timetable is usually ready in late July.</p> <p>Departments at the university have also received dozens of calls and emails from prospective and returning students, eager to begin planning activities around their timetables.</p> <p>Universities can typically expect to pay anything up to \u00a3100,000 for timetable software and hardware, and anything from \u00a350,000 a year upwards in subsequent staff and software maintenance costs, according to Graham Barley, director of Aims - a management consultancy firm set up to serve the UK higher education sector.</p> <p>\"Syllabus Plus is at the upper end of the software market, in terms of capability and hence cost,\" said Mr Barley.</p> <p>The university spokesman, Keith Seacroft, said the university had no plans to scrap the software and was planning to use it to produce all timetabling next year. It would still be used at the smaller Queen's campus, which accounts for 10% of Durham's students, following a \"satisfactory\" trial.</p> <p>Derek Wilson, a leading figure within the Durham branch of the Association of University Teachers, said: \"I told them back in May that it would never work. It's a complete balls up.\"</p>",
  "<p>In one decade an area of forest twice the size of Portugal has been destroyed in the Amazon, the planet's most bio-diverse forest, so a Brazilian plan to better protect the area through sustainable forestry, certainly sounds positive.</p> <p>But the plan - which is due to go to Brazilian Congress in two weeks - is proving highly controversial. </p> <p>The proposed law, first discussed in 2002 under Brazil's rightwing former president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, would grant access to public land for sustainable use, initially for 30 years. </p> <p>Licences would be allocated under a system of competitive bids and would be open only to Brazilian firms. Licence-holders would pay an annual fee calculated on what they extract, such as wood or resins, from their plot. </p> <p>But information on how much money the government will make from the licences is hard to come by.</p> <p>The topic gained particular notoriety after Brazil's O Globo newspaper described it as \"a plan to privatise the Amazon\", saying the government wanted to sell land to private enterprises, including non-Brazilians. </p> <p>The parliamentary group in defence of Brazil, a nationalist group, has claimed the law would threaten Brazil's sovereignty.</p> <p>The government says its intention is the exact opposite. </p> <p>Speaking to Guardian Unlimited last month during the second international Amazonian trade fair in the Amazonian city of Manaus, Malvino Salvador, forestry and sustainable development agency director for Amazonas state, said the law should \"facilitate conservation of public land and better protect it by insisting parties fulfil rules and pay for the privilege\".</p> <p>Environmental and social organisations largely favour regulation for sustainable land use, though they have expressed concerns about the details. </p> <p>However, in response to claims by O Globo that environmental organisations were violently opposed to the plan, a working group of NGOs and social groups was obliged to issue a statement clarifying their position, which stated: \"Contrary to press reports, the law is an attempt to guarantee public control for public land.\"</p> <p>That measures are needed to protect the Amazon is unquestionable; today the area is victim to illegal wood logging, destructive cattle ranching and soya production and forest burning at increasing rates. But how to protect the area, home to 20 million people and the generator of 8% of Brazil's exports, in an economically viable way is no easy feat. </p> <p>Even within the environment ministry there are diverging opinions. Virgilio Vianna, environment and sustainable development secretary for Amazonas state said: \"I favour the concession proposal. It is far better for [extraction] to be ordered and disciplined than not - but not in its current form.\" </p> <p>While 70% of the Amazon is public land, potential concession areas - land that remains outside conservation, local population or research areas - is far smaller at around 2%. </p> <p>In practice, this means a hectare, which typically has 300 adult trees and 10,000 more growing, would allow five to six trees to be chopped down every thirty years. </p> <p>\"With good forest management, you shouldn't be able to tell that trees have been cut,\" said Tasso Azevedo, director of the environment ministry's national forestry programme. </p> <p>One of the main hurdles to regulation is land ownership. \"There has been no legal framework permitting the use of public land, let alone encouraging sustainable use forest use,\" explained Brazil's Friends of the Earth director, Roberto Smeraldi. This has discouraged serious law-abiding businesses interested in invested, he added.</p> <p>And mapping such land remains a challenge. Paulo Barreto, a researcher with Imazon, which promotes sustainable development in the Amazon, explained that a high number of land title documents are illegal or false, and the government lacks ownership proof. </p> <p>Another concern is implementation of concessions. Jefferson Peres, senator for the leftwing Democratic Workers party, said implementation requires the National Institute of Colonisation and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and Brazil's Institute for Environmental and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) to have \"far more resources, trained personnel, and better coordination\". \"Implementing the law any time soon would be precipitous,\" he added. </p> <p>\"There are certainly ways the proposal could be improved,\" stated Friends of the Earth's Smeraldi. He cited the lack of guarantees as a problem, saying financial collateral is needed for concessions. </p> <p>He also said the government's choice of flexible payments (based on the value of what is extracted) does not encourage the most economical use of land, stimulate good forestry management or technological investment. </p> <p>Paulo Prado, of environmental organisation Conservation International (Brazil), added that the current study has not taken into account how to include local workforces into such projects.</p> <p>In response to such criticism, Mr Azevedo said the current situation is untenable. \"This law will provide some security - that alone is a gigantic change.\" The politician added: \"We are adopting this new model precisely because land is being destroyed now.\" But he added that the participation of NGOs and social groups in debating the law remains \"essential\". </p> <p>The government has examined over 50 cases of forestry concession worldwide but it is difficult to draw comparisons. Brazil's forests are generally more diverse and larger than elsewhere and already have significant communities living there.</p> <p>Peru, which adopted a law two years ago permitting long-term concessions, is the best equivalent model, argues Smeraldi, because it encompasses parts of the Amazon - although the Peruvian law is already being revised in the light of experience, Smeraldi said.</p> <p>And if parties don't fulfill the rules? \"We are not going to allow just anybody access to concession rights. If a party breaks the rules they lose their rights,\" said Malvino Salvador. Moreover, for the first 10 years only 20% of the potential land will available for concessions. </p> <p>Flying over the Amazon, it is impossible to imagine that a lack of trees, which reach far further than they eye can see, could ever be a problem. But Brazil's Atlantic forest only has 7% intact. \"We cannot repeat this in the Amazon,\" warned Virg\u00edlio Vianna.</p> <p>When the law reaches Congress in the coming weeks it will doubtless generate a heated debate. As Jose Rabelo of Amazonas' environment protection institute (IPAAM) made clear: \"Doing nothing is not an option.\"</p>",
  "The British R&amp;B star Jamelia triumphed last night at the beleaguered Mobo awards ceremony. <p>The Birmingham-born singer, whose album Thank You was also recently nominated for the Mercury music prize, beat strong competition from American acts Outkast and Kelis to win every category for which she was nominated. </p> <p>Best single, best video and UK act of the year, the last shared with the rapper Dizzee Rascal, crown a remarkable comeback for the artist, who took a year out from her career to have her daughter Teja. </p> <p>Her tally was matched by US rapper and producer Kanye West. He had a record seven nominations, but proved to be among a host of big American names who failed to turn up at the ceremony. He nevertheless won best hip-hop act, best producer, and best album for his chart-topping The College Dropout. Other winners included Janet Jackson, Icon hall of fame award, and US singer Anita Baker, the lifetime achievement award. </p> <p>Founded nine years ago at a ceremony launched by Tony Blair, the Mobos are intended to reward music of black origin. </p> <p>They have frequently courted controversy, not least by nominating white artists: last year, the best R&amp;B act title was won by former boyband member Justin Timberlake, while this year's award for best jazz act went to middle-of-the-road crooner Jamie Cullum. </p> <p>This year, however, both the event's television coverage and sponsorship were threatened after gay rights activists OutRage! protested against the nomination of Jamaican artists who, they claimed, promoted violence against homosexuals in their lyrics. Vybz Kartel and Elephant Man were removed from the nominations list for the best reggae act award after refusing to provide the event's organisers with a written apology for songs which advocate the killing of gay men and women. The award was won by the determinedly non-controversial pop-reggae artist Sean Paul. </p> <p>The red carpet proceedings were disrupted last night as 60 representatives of the Black Music Council played bongo drums and shouted for the public to \"defend reggae music\". They said they were enraged by the campaign run by OutRage! and accused the group of negrophobia. </p> <p>The deputy chairman of the Black Music Council, Mr X, said last night that, while he did not condone inciting violence, the campaign run by OutRage! was insidious and tarnishing reggae music. </p> <p>\"When you say murder or kill in a song it doesn't literally mean get a gun and spray everyone,\" he said. \"This language is colloquial, slang. These are artists as in 'art'. They do not have a political agenda and should be allowed to have freedom in a democratic society.\" During the protest, the group was approached by a man who said he was black and gay and found the lyrics offensive. </p> <p>Peter Tatchell of OutRage! said police would not be investigating singers if their lyrics did not incite violence. \"The translations were done by a Jamaican fluent in [Jamaican] Patois, his translations were corroborated by two other Patois speakers,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Even the singers' fans give the same interpretations on their website and in the death threats they are sending us. One said, 'Beenie Man is right, kill all queers'.\" Mr Tatchell added: \"We are astonished that the Black Music Council is defending the right of performers to encourage and glorify the killing of homosexuals.\" </p> <p>In another protest, the British soul singer Beverley Knight claimed she was snubbing the ceremony in protest at the Mobos' failure to recognise British talent, claiming that \"every award could end up in American hands\", despite the fact that four awards were specifically limited to the UK. </p> <p>Further controversy was caused by the Mobos' decision to give an award for the best mobile phone ringtone of the year. The rise in popularity of ringtones among teenagers has been linked to declining record sales: they currently account for 10% of the world music market. The award was won by Mario Wynan's I Don't Wanna Know, a track which also reached number one in the singles chart.</p>",
  "<p>The joint parliamentary committee's robust report on the draft charities bill represents the blueprint of a legal framework fit for a new age in which charities are challenging many traditional attitudes with their increasing professionalism, growing role in public service delivery and high profile campaigning activities. We are on the verge of the greatest shake-up of charity law and regulation for 400 years.</p> <p>Clearly, a central focus of the committee's work has been the question of public benefit, and whether the proposed changes would apply to independent schools and private hospitals. We are pleased that this issue has been resolved and that the committee has recommended that public benefit should be assessed on the basis of the principles outlined in the joint statement recently issued by the Home Office and the Charity Commission, not defined in statute. </p> <p>We are far less convinced by the committee's recommendation that non-statutory guidance on public benefit could be issued by the secretary of state or criteria included in the bill itself. We feel strongly that this should be a matter for the regulator.</p> <p>We are particularly pleased that the committee agrees with NCVO that the proposed 'social and economic impact objective' for the Charity Commission is inappropriate, and that there should be a clearer distinction between the commission's regulatory and advisory roles. </p> <p>The committee's recommendations for the proposed appeals tribunal are also very helpful, calling for an increase in the range of decisions (and non-decisions) which can be appealed against, and recommending that the tribunal should have the power to award costs and compensation against the commission. It also suggests that ministers should have reserve powers to provide financial assistance to organisations if it turns out that cost is a barrier to taking cases to appeal.</p> <p>Perhaps one of the most misunderstood aspects of this process in the media has been the extent to which the impetus for charity law reform has come from charities themselves: back in 2001 NCVO published proposals for reform, including a universal public benefit test, that won widespread support. This may explain why the government-backed bill has been underpinned by such an unprecedented level of consensus in the sector. This was cemented in a sector-wide campaign, led by the Charities Bill Coalition, whose members agreed to re-form earlier this year as the Coalition for a Charities Act. The coalition now numbers over 40 organisations.</p> <p>So far we have got what we asked for. A robust piece of legislation which puts public benefit at the centre of charity law. There is no reason why we should not see a Charities Act on the statute books in 2005. It all hangs now on the government's own political will. Nonetheless it is hard not to await the Queen's speech with a certain sense of optimism. The quality of the legislation should not be sacrificed for its speedy passage onto the statute books, but given that we are probably less than a year from the next general election, maintaining the momentum of reform is going to be critical.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Stuart Etherington is chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations</p>",
  "At least 80 people were reported dead today after US and Iraqi forces launched a major assault to regain control of the rebel stronghold of Samarra. <p>Troops of the US 1st Infantry Division, the Iraqi National Guard and Iraqi army moved into the town, about 60 miles north of Baghdad, after midnight under cover of heavy air and artillery fire. By the early hours of today, the offensive had succeeded in securing government and police buildings, the US military command said. </p> <p>Residents cowered in their homes as tanks and warplanes pounded the city overnight. The sound of loud shelling mixed with the crackle of automatic gunfire continued into the morning. At least three houses were flattened and dozens of cars burnt out, residents said. </p> <p>\"We are terrified by the violent approach used by the Americans to subdue the city,\" said Mahmoud Saleh, a 33-year-old civil servant. \"My wife and children are scared to death and they have not being able to sleep since last night. I hope that the fighting ends as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>At least 80 bodies and more than 100 wounded were brought to Samarra general hospital, said Dr Khalid Ahmed. The hospital was running out bandages, oxygen and other supplies, he said. There were no immediate reports of US casualties. </p> <p>US troops ordered residents to stay off the streets as they moved in to and began carrying out house-to-house searches. A 7pm to 7am curfew was later announced through loud-hailers. </p> <p>Today's assault came in response to \"repeated and unprovoked attacks by anti-Iraqi forces\" against Iraqi and coalition forces, a military statement said. Its aim was to \"facilitate orderly government processes, kill or capture anti-Iraqi forces and set the conditions to proceed with infrastructure and quality-of-life improvements\" in the city.</p> <p>\"Unimpeded access throughout the city for Iraqi security forces and multinational forces is non-negotiable,\" the statement said. </p> <p>The military said insurgent attacks and acts of intimidation against the people of Samarra had undermined the security situation in the city, regarded as one of the top three rebel strongholds in Iraq, along with Falluja and the impoverished Baghdad district known as Sadr City. </p> <p>An earlier report by CNN said 2,000 rebels were believed to be holed up in Samarra and that troops were taking the city \"sector by sector.\" </p> <p>Samarra has been under insurgent control and a virtual no-go area for US troops since May 30. The Americans returned briefly on September 9 under a peace deal brokered by tribal leaders. US forces agreed to provide millions of dollars in reconstruction aid in exchange for an end to attacks on American and Iraqi troops. </p> <p>In recent weeks, however, the city witnessed sporadic clashes between US troops and insurgents. Masked gunmen carrying the flag of Iraq's most feared terror group, Tawhid and Jihad, surfaced in force in Samarra on Tuesday, staging a defiant drive through the streets. Members of the same group, led by Jordanian terror suspect Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, have been holding British engineer Ken Bigley hostage.</p>",
  "In the court of international opinion, it sometimes seems the US just cannot win. A string of surveys suggests growing resentment around the world over America's role as \"global policeman\". <p>But when Washington's squad cars fail to arrive at the scene of an incident, the US gets blamed for inaction. </p> <p>Sudan is a good example. According to the UN, the tragedy in Darfur is \"the world's worst humanitarian crisis\". </p> <p>Two UN security council resolutions, and much diplomatic huffing and puffing, have so far failed to end the suffering. </p> <p>The Bush administration has not been silent, declaring this month that a genocide is in progress in Darfur. Under international law, that means it is legally obliged to stop it. But George Bush appears to have no plans for direct humanitarian intervention, either unilaterally or under UN auspices. </p> <p>Many people may feel this is irresponsible. And indeed, criticism can be heard, not least from the Democratic presidential contender, John Kerry, that President Bush is neglecting a wide range of other international flashpoints as he focuses on November's elections. </p> <p>The list includes North Korea's nuclear bomb making, similar worries about Iran, intensifying instability in Afghanistan, Russia's imploding democracy, the China-Taiwan stand-off, and the moribund Middle East peace process. </p> <p>Yet while global expectations of the US remain high, international opinion surveys reveal a deep contradiction: Europeans and others who complain Washington is not doing enough in places such as Sudan or Palestine simultaneously favour a diminution of the global super-cop act of the US. </p> <p>According to a poll conducted by the German Marshall Fund - Transatlantic Trends 2004 - 58% of Europeans say that, in theory at least, they want less US leadership in international affairs, not more. </p> <p>And 76% disapprove of US foreign policy (up 20% in two years). </p> <p>This year's Pew Research Centre's Global Attitudes Project found that in most countries, US leadership and motives were being increasingly distrusted; 78% of French respondents doubted that the US was intent on promoting democracy round the world. \"There is even more scepticism for the motives for the 'war on terrorism' in predominantly Muslim countries,\" the Pew survey states. \"By wide margins, the publics [sic] of Turkey, Morocco, Jordan and Pakistan question America's sincerity.\" </p> <p>Instead, majorities there and elsewhere believe the principal US aim is world domination. </p> <p>Intriguingly, however, US public attitudes coincide on many points with those of Europeans and Arabs/Muslims. Dismayingly for British Eurosceptics, the Marshall Fund poll found, for example, that 70% of US respondents would like to see a morepowerful EU showing greater international leadership. </p> <p>Another survey, published this week by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations (Global Views 2004), reports that more than three-quarters of Americans disapprove of the US behaving as a planetary law enforcer. </p> <p>Most Americans think the that US should be more willing to work through the UN, that it should sign up to the Kyoto protocol on global warming as well as to the international criminal court, and also pay more heed to world court rulings. </p> <p>The Chicago survey found Americans' support for maintaining US forces' bases in the Middle East to be falling sharply; and that \"the US should withdraw its forces from Iraq if a clear majority of the Iraqi people wants this\". </p> <p>Strikingly, a majority of Americans also rejects the Bush doctrine of preventive, unilateral war, and, in even larger numbers, opposes \"the use of US troops to install democratic governments in states where dictators rule\". </p> <p>Nor is this simply a revival of isolationism. While joining much of the world in rejecting the US role of global policeman, Americans make a distinction in situations such as Darfur. According to the Chicago poll, they \"strongly endorse\" use of force to prevent genocide and \"favour using US troops for this purpose\". </p> <p>The public's message in the US, Europe and elsewhere seems broadly consistent: America's unmatched power, used wisely and sparingly, can be a force for good. When it is not, as in Iraq, the US ends up in the dock.</p>",
  "<p>Nearly half of families with disabled children receive no support from the NHS or social services, according to research published today.</p> <p>Centre-right thinktank the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) found that 48% of families with disabled children received no help from outside the family and a further 30% received less than two hours support per week. </p> <p>Its report, People, Not Budgets: Valuing Disabled Children, concluded that the quality of care provided to Britain's 49,000 severely disabled children was \"often extremely poor\".</p> <p>Four out of five families (80%) said health and social services were \"not properly coordinated\". </p> <p>\"The level of support given to these families by social services is often extremely poor,\" the report said. \"The system is bureaucratic, has little sense of responsibility and is fuelled by ideological theories that have little relevance to everyday life.\"</p> <p>The thinktank warned that the situation was set to get worse as medical advances meant more disabled children were born and lived longer. </p> <p>The report recommended giving the families of disabled children more control over their own lives. It called for the \u00a3140m currently spent on commissioning social services for the disabled to be given directly to the families as a non-means-tested payment in addition to current benefits. The thinktank estimated this extra money would be worth \u00a3115 a week. </p> <p>\"Families living in these circumstances tend to know what they need,\" the report said. \"They would also usually much rather choose care services themselves than receive insufficient help from local authorities. Unfortunately, the rigidity of the current system does not give families any personal choice.\" </p> <p>The report coincides with new laws coming into effect (part three of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995) that require all business and service providers to ensure that their services are accessible to the 10 million people with disabilities in Britain.</p>",
  "This week Sir Richard Branson announced his plans to fly the first commercial passengers into space. For around a hundred grand, members of the public will be able to fly 60 miles above the Earth and enjoy the view. \"We will be giving people something they will remember for the rest of their lives,\" he promised, which, if recent space adventures are anything to go by, may not be that long. Who can blame people for being so concerned about the risks involved? You might pay all that money and end up sitting next to Sir Richard Branson. <p>At \u00a3640 a minute, this trip looks set to be the most expensive journey in the history of travel, and they'll probably still charge you extra for the headphones. And with only four minutes to look down at Planet Earth there's going to be a hell of an argument over which of the kids gets the window seat. </p> <p>\"It's not fair - all I can see is the wing.\" </p> <p>\"Never mind, dear - why don't you colour in the Disney pictures in your fun pack? </p> <p>Passengers will be required to undertake three days of astronaut training before coming on board, after which they will be expected to demonstrate a thorough knowledge of space travel. \"No, James Earl Jones only did the voice for Darth Vader; the man in the suit was Dave Prowse.\" </p> <p>In fact, the first space plane will rather unoriginally be called \"the VSS Enterprise\" - as Virgin seek to mix contemporary air travel with the iconic myths of Star Trek. The search is now on for a gay Vulcan to be an air steward. Whether British Airways hires Klingons to try to poach Virgin's customers remains to be seen. </p> <p>Take off will be from a special airfield in the Mojave desert of California, because all the slots at Stansted had already been nabbed by Ryanair. Passengers will be securely strapped in while the craft accelerates to 2,000 miles an hour in 25 seconds. Rather worryingly, there is no toilet on board, presumably because with that sort of take-off the passengers will have wet themselves already. But once the seatbelt signs are switched off, passengers will literally float around the plane, peeking out of one of the portholes or trying to catch the last little cheese triangle that floated off their plate as they left the Earth's atmosphere. </p> <p>Then there are four short minutes spent listening to everyone saying \"Hmm, you know, when you see the whole Earth like that, it makes you realise how insignificant we really all are\", while the bloke next to you just missed it all because he was still trying to get his plastic knife and fork out of the cellophane wrapper. </p> <p>As tourist attractions go, three days' wait for 240 seconds of excitement puts it roughly on a par with the Dragon Falls at Chessington World of Adventure. After that it's the long flight back home nervously listening out for any announcements. \"This is your captain speaking. Space traffic control say there may be a slight delay in re-entering the Earth's atmosphere, a little bit of bad weather up ahead so we may have to divert to the moon unfortunately - anyway, just sit back, pop on the headphones and listen to the in-flight music channel.\" Ground control to Major Tom ... hums the golden oldies channel as the customers try not to look too anxious. That is, of course, if the whole thing isn't an elaborate con and customers are secretly seated aboard a sophisticated flight simulator. (Suspicions that the incredible view of the stars is actually stock video footage will not be helped by the little sign in the corner that says London Planetarium - Exit via Gift Shop.) </p> <p>This is only the first step towards a projected space tourism industry that it is predicted will see orbiting hotels being built within our lifetime. Why anyone would want to go on holiday to outer space remains a mystery; if you want to pay a fortune to stay in the middle of a lifeless vacuum, there's a hotel in Beaconsfield I could recommend. But, basically, if your stag weekend is still just a booze cruise to Prague, you'll be a laughing stock. </p> <p>A hundred thousand pounds is probably not a particularly astronomical price for the multi-millionaires who are already queuing up for an \"out of this world\" experience. But, of course, the real cost will not be paid by the super-rich thrill-seekers. Increasing air travel is a major cause of greenhouse gases and the advent of space tourism will take pollution up to a whole new level. </p> <p>So that's why they need a fully functional space hotel up there. Where else to sit back and watch the Earth die from all the pollution caused by unnecessary air travel and commercial space rockets? </p> <p>Our best chance of saving Planet Earth will be that Richard Branson's latest pet project will come up against some insurmountable obstacles between now and take-off. Let's just hope all the passengers get Virgin trains to the airport. That should delay things another year or two.</p>",
  "<p>The Disability Rights Commission warned last night that businesses in 80% of Britain's high streets have failed to adapt their premises to comply with anti-discrimination legislation which comes into force today. </p> <p>Bert Massie, the commission's chairman, said it would take legal action to enforce compliance by shops, restaurants, health centres and public buildings. </p> <p>Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, business premises had nine years to prepare wheelchair access and other facilities such as large-print information in cafes and cinemas. </p> <p>They were advised that improving access for Britain's 10 million disabled people would cost little and help them tap into the disabled community's \u00a350bn annual spending power. </p> <p>The commission asked the pollsters NOP to survey progress in high streets in 11 of the biggest cities. A team of wheelchair users and shoppers with a mobility impairment found problems in 80% of the main retail areas. Nearly a quarter of the 88 major high street outlets surveyed were rated as poor or very poor. </p> <p>Mr Massie said : \"October 1 is a landmark date for disabled people.

  "<p>Daytime TV host Trisha Goddard has quit ITV after six years to start a new career at Five. </p> <p>She has agreed a two-year deal with the channel to present a morning weekday show from early next year.</p> <p>The 46-year-old said: \"I've had six fantastic years at ITV and been fortunate enough to work with some great people. </p> <p>\"However, emotional upheaval can make one re-evaluate one's life, and I know in my heart that it's time for a change. </p> <p>\"I feel the need to refresh and reinvigorate my television career and I've been really impressed by the energy and enthusiasm evident in Five's approach.\" </p> <p>Past reports said Goddard's daytime TV show, Trisha, was being axed by ITV bosses after a series of rows over money and control of the series after the TV star said she wanted to run the show in the way Robert Kilroy-Silk's company produced his BBC daytime series.</p> <p>Trisha proved a huge hit with viewers on ITV1, regularly pulling in an audience of 1.6 million. </p> <p>But, according to reports, moves were being made to oust her when contract negotiations between her and Granada bosses broke down. Last night Goddard appeared to criticise ITV, saying: \"Naturally it's a great buzz to know that Five is happy to support me in doing what I love doing best: letting people tell their stories their own way. </p> <p>\"The deal with Five also gives me the opportunity to grow creatively in prime time. All change is scary, but this is tremendously exciting too.\" At Five she will also get a number of prime time projects.</p> <p>Goddard, whose mother and best friend died this year, said: \"Personally and emotionally 2004 has been one of the most difficult years of my life. I've struggled with some devastating losses which are still painful.\" </p> <p>A Granada insider said channel bosses clashed with the TV host, who is reported to have earned \u00a3500,000 a year with ITV, over her future. </p> <p>The insider said: \"Trisha wanted to do peaktime and wanted more money. We offered to renew her contract at the end of the year, but only on the basis of a morning show. Money was an issue.\" </p> <p>But a Five insider said: \"ITV was very keen to keep hold of her.\" The new multimillion-pound deal means Goddard will host a programme similar in format to her ITV show. The new series will be made by Town House Productions, a new independent company co-owned by the star and Malcolm Allsop, a former director of programmes at Anglia Television. </p> <p>Goddard worked in Australia for 13 years as a TV reporter, presenter and government adviser on mental health before joining ITV. </p> <p>Born in London, she emigrated to Australia in 1985 and within two years became the first black news anchorwoman on Australian TV. </p> <p>She took over the ITV show from Vanessa Feltz after the latter was poached by the BBC, which offered her more money. </p> <p>Diane Nelmes, Granada's director of daytime, said: \"I would like to thank Trisha for her contribution to the channel over the last six years.\" </p> <p>The Five controller of daytime, Kim Peat, said: \"It's tremendously exciting to have Trisha as part of our daytime schedule.

  "No prime minister has ever announced his plans for his own future the way Tony Blair did yesterday. Either they deflect the question, pretending they want to do the job forever, or they announce their resignation, effective immediately. Mr Blair opted for an unprecedented position - somewhere between the two. <p>That would be drama enough, but to reveal his decision - to resign in five years' time - on the last night of a party conference dominated by questions over his political future and on the eve of a stay in hospital for a recurring heart problem was to pile on the sensation. </p> <p>The straightforward reading is simple. The Blair team knew that the medical problem, and the revelation that he has already made property plans for retirement, would spark yet another round of speculation about his eventual exit from office. Better to pre-empt that with an air-clearing announcement that resolves the matter once and for all. </p> <p>Some will also admire Mr Blair's announcement as candid and transparent. </p> <p>Nevertheless, this move surely cannot hold. For one thing, Mr Blair risks becoming an instant lame duck - an outgoing prime minister, even if he might not be gone until 2010. In theory that needn't be the case: after all, if George Bush is re-elected on November 2, he too will only be able to serve one more full term and no one will call him a lame duck. </p> <p>But British politics is not like that. We do not have any system of term limits. Besides, there is a context: two febrile years over Iraq, tension between the prime minister and his chancellor and the questions triggered by the medical and property revelations. In that atmosphere, many will ask whether Mr Blair's decision will not now sap his authority. </p> <p>Take the Blair-Brown relationship. Not only has the prime minister told Mr Brown he will have to wait at least five years for his inheritance, but he also made a pointed shift in his TV interviews yesterday. Rather than reconfirming that he saw Mr Brown as his natural successor, he said that \"lots of people\" were interested in the top job. That is a pretty direct snub. </p> <p>There are more practical reasons why this cannot pan out as Mr Blair hopes. He says he wants to serve a full third term. That would mean choosing a new leader a few weeks before a general election. Mr Blair will surely have to go much earlier to give his successor time to dig in. </p> <p>On the other hand, if Mr Blair were to stick to his word, he has fired the starting gun for a leadership contest that would last at least four years. What could be more destabilising for the unity of his party and government? </p> <p>Above all, Mr Blair's move does little to address the very problems that have put his leadership in question. Labour's internal polling shows that he has lost the public trust and that, apparently, there is uncertainty over the country's direction. </p> <p>This statement will not heal Labour's ailments; it may well inflict new and more severe ones. It is not the end of the matter.</p>",
  "<p>One of the founding fathers of funk and soul-jazz piano in action in 1969 (four years after its million-selling hit with The In Crowd), Ramsey Lewis's trio rocking its way through the repeating licks that set plenty of fans bopping their way to the record stores, and plenty of jazzbos grumbling about commercialism. The formula is as you'd expect, but though Lewis by now felt obliged to disguise his jazz-improv skills his licks-playing is undeniably engaging, his sense of dynamics and drama acute, and the drumming of Maurice White, before his departure to Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, very tight and commanding.</p> <p>Lewis does unfurl his classical-grounded acoustic lyricism on a torridly romantic account of the ballad How Beautiful Is Spring, but the presence of the great funk guitarist Phil Upchurch on three tracks is the real bonus - even if you don't hear that much of him, except the typical singing high sounds and chunky rhythm playing on the driving Bold and Black. There's lots of shouting of \"All right!\" and Do it!\" in the background, of course.</p>",
  "<p>The amiable Norman Cook has grown rich on the proceeds of one idea - he pastes together a vocal line from Song A and a rhythm track (could be funk, could be house) from Song B, creating an irritatingly catchy Song C (eg 1998's Rockafeller Skank). It's been four years since Cook's last album, which is exactly the time it has taken for \"Check it out now, the funk soul brother\" to stop whirling around one's head.</p> <p>Presumably, Fatboy intends to restart the process with album number three. There are fewer samples than before, more live vocals (Damon Albarn drifts through the African-flavoured Put It Back Together) and, for the first time, real instruments, on the Toploaderish Long Way from Home. But nearly half the songs are traditional Cook cut-and-paste jobs. North West Three, dedicated to wife Zoe Ball, samples Beverley Martin's Primrose Hill, and Don't Let the Man is lifted from the little-remembered but intensely annoying 70s hippy \"anthem\" Signs. It's not enough this time around, though, simply to tack on computer-generated beats. Luckily, the \"live\" half suggests that he knows this and is addressing the problem.</p>",
  "<p>Ofcom, the media regulator, yesterday published a 137-page blueprint of how public service broadcasting can be delivered in the pressures of the digital age. </p> <p>Against the background of the gradual shutdown of the analogue television signal and the move to a fully digital broadcasting network, Ofcom said big changes were necessary to preserve the vibrancy and quality of British television. </p> <p>Ofcom's report accepts the pressures of the market: the value of ITV's analogue services - the \"licence to print money\" - is falling away and eventually the network could choose to give up its public service obligations and become a digital channel like any other. To prevent this, Ofcom says ITV - and Five - should be relieved of some public service obligations. </p> <p>It also accepts that Channel 4's advertiser-funded finance model may not be viable in the long term, but rejects outright privatisation. As a bulwark, the report supports a \"fully-funded\" BBC. </p> <p>To address this changing world and maintain \"plurality\" in public service broadcasting, Ofcom is proposing a new broadcasting organisation, funded by \u00a3300m of public money every year, that would commission and transmit the kind of merit programming that ITV and Five are likely to abandon in the coming years. </p> <p><strong> Public service publisher</strong><br> </p> <p>The new venture would prevent the BBC from becoming the monopoly public service provider. Its \u00a3300m budget and a remit to make three hours of programmes a day works out at about \u00a3200,000 an hour: enough to make a well-funded edition of Panorama, a medium-budget drama or a couple of episodes of soaps like EastEnders or Coronation Street. </p> <p>The venture would not make any programmes itself but, like Channel 4, would commission and pay for them to be made by independent producers. The report says the new organisation would be more than just a new channel: \"Much of the PSP's digital content would be more likely to resemble traditional TV programmes, but it would not be a TV channel in the traditional sense.\" As well as being broadcast on television, the programmes could also be delivered via a broadband connection or direct to personal video recorders like Sky Plus. </p> <p>Ofcom suggests three options for funding the new organisation: a supplement to the BBC licence fee; general taxation in the same way the BBC World Service is funded; or a tax on other broadcasters' turnover. Commercial broadcasters are likely to oppose the third option, while neither MPs nor the Treasury are likely to support the second. </p> <p>The problem with the first is that licence fee payers may not countenance an above-inflation hike: in theory, a rise of \u00a315 a year on the \u00a3121 licence fee would be required. But this could be brought down by the extra income that is expected to come from the growth in households in coming years. </p> <p><strong> BBC</strong><br> </p> <p>The public service publisher would keep the BBC \"on its mettle\", said Ed Richards, senior partner at Ofcom and one of the driving forces behind yesterday's report. But Ofcom drew back from a suggestion in phase one of its review of public service television, published earlier this year, that the BBC's licence fee income should be \"top-sliced\" and a portion handed to other broadcasters. This did not find favour with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and Ofcom now says the BBC should be \"fully funded\" by the licence fee. </p> <p>Only once the level has been decided should any supplement be levied, which would then fund the new public service publisher. </p> <p>The review also suggests the corporation should be asked to \"report on the case for limited subscription services at the time of a mid-point review of its next charter\". That falls at about 2011-12, the same time as the government is expected to complete the phased process of switching off the analogue television signal. </p> <p><strong> Channel 4</strong><br> </p> <p>Ofcom said Channel 4 is expected to \"remain a vital force\" in public service broadcasting, with its remit to provide innovative and distinctive programming funded by advertising in the short term at least. \"We do not support the privatisation of Channel 4; the channel should remain primarily not-for-profit\". </p> <p>The regulator encouraged the channel to offer more free-to-air channels to meet its \"public purposes\" - at the moment its digital channels E4 and Film Four are subscription-based. It added that the channel should be \"free to form alliances, joint ventures and partnerships\". In the past few months, C4 executives have talked to counterparts at Five and the BBC about various joint ventures and smaller alliances. Some of these options would require legislation. </p> <p>Ofcom agreed with Channel 4's own analysis that it may not survive in the longer term without some help, when its public service obligations may become too onerous in a more competitive market. \"There may be a case for considering further action such as the transfer of income-generating assets from the BBC to Channel 4,\" it said. </p> <p>The report did not spell out what those assets may be, but these could include entire services such as Radio 1. The document also made it clear that Channel 4 could bid to run the new public service publisher. </p> <p><strong> ITV/Five</strong><br> </p> <p>In the run-up to digital switchover, Ofcom has agreed to halve ITV's obligations to provide non-news local programming in the English regions to 1.5 hours a week. </p> <p>\"Much non-news regional programming receives low audiences, is not highly valued by audiences. Especially in England, it has been pushed to the margins of the schedule, with low production values.\" ITV's non-news obligations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also be reviewed. </p> <p>Ofcom said it would take a more \"flexible\" approach to ITV's commitments in the area of children's, religious and arts programming. ITV has long argued that its obligations in this area, which includes a commitment to show 104 hours of religious programming a year, are too tough. </p> <p>After digital switchover, when ITV gives up its analogue licences - the principal mechanism by which public service obligations are enforced - there are likely to be greater reductions in ITV's remit. At that time, Ofcom says ITV's obligations would be limited to producing \"high-value UK programming, news, current affairs and, if financially sustainable, a core regional news service\". It would no longer be forced to carry arts, religious or children's programmes - and its regional news service may also go. </p> <p>The report suggests that many of the obligations previously attached to ITV in respect of regional programming should transfer to the BBC. Five, the channel owned by German media group RTL and UBM, is to continue to play \"a modest but important role\" in providing public service broadcasting.</p>",
  "<p>The media regulator, Ofcom, yesterday proposed a new \u00a3300m public television service to provide competition for the BBC in the digital age. </p> <p>It would be the first new public service broadcaster since the launch of Channel Five more than seven years ago. The organisation would be able to commission and transmit three hours of programmes a day with an average cost of \u00a3200,000 an hour. The annual budget is nearly twice that of Five and two-thirds that of Channel 4. </p> <p>Ofcom said the BBC should continue to be \"fully funded\" by the licence fee for the length of the next royal charter, which will begin in 2007, but it recommended the BBC be forced to consider the possibility of a limited form of subscription for the future beyond that. It also suggested a phased withdrawal from ITV's obligations to broadcast arts, religious, children's and regional programmes. </p> <p>The proposals were contained in the regulator's blueprint for the future of public service broadcasting in Britain. The report sets out to secure the gold standard of British broadcasting, which is under threat as millions of viewers abandon traditional networks in favour of niche digital channels. </p> <p>If nothing is done, Ofcom said yesterday, the current system would wither away when the analogue system is switched off by 2012. </p> <p>The BBC reacted cautiously yesterday, saying it welcomed plurality in the public service broadcasting market. But it said Ofcom's \"complex\" plans required careful consideration; in private, BBC sources were sceptical about how it could be made to work. </p> <p>Ofcom said any organisation or consortium could bid to run the new service, which would have a 10-year licence. It was already being suggested yesterday that Channel 4 would be best placed to operate it. </p> <p>The regulator put forward three suggestions for funding the new service: direct taxation, a tax on existing broadcasters' turnover, or a supplement to the licence fee. Under the present system, a \u00a3300m organisation would require a \u00a315 hike in the \u00a3121 licence. </p> <p>Ed Richards, a senior partner at Ofcom, said its proposals would ensure public service broadcasting does not become the monopoly preserve of the BBC. \"We want to create a vibrant, dynamic system, rather than a situation where it is provided by just one organisation.\" </p> <p>Ofcom said the proposals had been discussed with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, but not with the BBC. They would require primary legislation, and it could be some years before the new service is set up. Ofcom recommended it should be operating by the time the switchover from analogue to digital is completed, currently envisaged for the end of 2012. </p> <p>Ofcom's report is a recognition that other broadcasters like ITV and Channel 4 are finding it increasingly difficult to fulfil their remits in the face of increasing competition. It said Channel 4 should remain \"a vital force\" in the provision of public service broadcasting, but adds: \"We expect Channel 4 to use its considerable financial resources to ensure it maintains a sharper focus on its public purposes.\" Only in the medium to long term will it consider changes to the funding model, such as switching assets from the BBC to Channel 4. There has already been speculation about the future of Radio 1, but Ofcom did not go into details yesterday. </p> <p>The regulator also proposed a \"phased withdrawal\" from ITV's public service obligations, beginning with a cut in regional non-news programming. </p> <p>This was welcomed by ITV, which said it entirely agreed with the proposals, the result of fierce lobbing by the broadcaster. But the National Union of Journalists said the proposals to cut ITV's regional commitments would be a disaster. </p> <p>Channel 4 made plain its interest in running the new service, saying it could \"offer us a means to expand Channel 4's unique brand of creativity on to new digital platforms\". The proposals are now the subject of consultation. Ofcom will publish its final report by the end of the year.</p>",

Although the superficial mark of McElwee's style - the almost-zero-budget, one-guy-with-a-camera, real-life approach to big screen narrative - has become a commonplace in the two decades since Sherman's March, the deeper features that make McElwee's work so unique, moving and funny now set him apart from his contemporaries more clearly than ever. </p> <p>\"Michael Moore has been very gracious in his appreciation,\" says McElwee from his office at Harvard, where he teaches. \"But clearly he's gone off in a whole different direction. The only similarity, I think, is logistically. But then that's not true any more, because he's got a crew now.\" </p> <p>As with most of his films, McElwee made Bright Leaves by himself. He was producer, director, camerman, sound recordist and editor, and quite often made his own coffee as well. \"I think filming alone enables me to move at my own pace,\" he says. \"When you've got a crew in tow you're forced to think more methodically about what you're going to accomplish because you're spending other people's time, and a great deal of money employing them. The other advantage is that the people in front of the camera are more relaxed.\" </p> <p>The new film, opening in London next week, purports to be about McElwee's research into the story behind a 1950 Hollywood movie, Bright Leaf, starring Gary Cooper, Lauren Bacall and Patricia Neal. That film portrays rival North Carolina tobacco barons; McElwee, who hails from North Carolina, believed the Cooper character was based on the biography of his great-grandfather. </p> <p>In fact, the film is about much more. Bright Leaves takes you on a winding road that, although it ends up nowhere in particular, takes in McElwee's meditations about his own life, his father and his son; the oddness of charming people growing, in lovely countryside, beautiful green tobacco plants that go on to kill half a million people in the US each year; the question of whether Hollywood films can contain secret home movies hidden inside them; the pleasures of smoking; a dog, a cat, and a rat; shrinking beauty queens; and the residual grudges of rival southern families. Bright Leaves, with its chance encounters and digressive riffing, appears to have been thrown together as much as it was planned; yet as the film proceeds, it paints a picture of McElwee, his vast extended family and their North Carolina community that is somehow more true and intimate than any feature film, and most documentaries, could provide. </p> <p>To those who have seen any of McElwee's earlier films - he has made seven feature-length documentaries - the style will be familiar. Sherman's March was, its narrator announced, a serious documentary about the bloody travels of General William Sherman through Georgia during the American civil war. What audiences actually saw was one of the funniest films ever made, as the film-maker was interrupted in his researches by falling in love, or lust, with a series of wonderfully real women whose paths he appeared to cross arbitrarily. </p> <p>If Sherman's March was a film about love disguised as a documentary about war, Bright Leaves is a film about death disguised as a jolly rummage through the family attic. With its meandering storyline, its obsession with fathers, children and mortality, and its urban, northern hero's quest for meaning in his rural, southern motherland, it seems as much like a modern American novel as a modern American film. </p> <p>\"I think that's accurate,\" says McElwee. \"When I was at high school, when I was 17 or 18, I was sure I wanted to be a fiction writer, and I went into university as a creative writing major ... I don't think I ever left my writerly desires, and my urge to conjoin documentary material with a very subjective, internal stream-of-consciousness narration probably connected with my early desire to write.\" </p> <p>After Sherman's March, which won the feature documentary category at Sundance and was named by the International Documentary Association as one of the top 20 documentaries of all time, McElwee made three films before his latest: Something to Do With the Wall (1990), with Marilyn Levine, about Berlin and the cold war; Time Indefinite (1993), a sequel to Sherman's March; and Six O'Clock News (1996), about the way local news stations report catastrophes. </p> <p>He has never grown wealthy from cinema. Time and income are split between teaching and making films, both of which he enjoys. \"Once, I tried to do something for Miramax,\" he says. \"They wanted me to try shaping a script. I liked the material; I worked on it for a long time. Basically, they rejected it.\" </p> <p>Bright Leaves was a long time in the making. The first scene was shot in 1997. One of the oddities of the film is that it has footage of one of McElwee's sons, Adrian, as a small boy and as a much older boy. In some ways, McElwee resembles a southern Presbyterian Woody Allen and he conceded that what he may be making is a single, long film covering his, the director's, entire life. </p> <p>\"The last shot of Time Indefinite is the first shot of Six O'Clock News,\" he says. \"The same people keep reappearing in my films. I'm interested in how much we change over time and how little we change over time. I think there are people out there who find looking at all the films an interesting experience.\" </p> <p>It may be that McElwee's solipsistic sense of his own life-narrative - plus an enormous amount of patient, skilful editing - is what makes his documentaries so much more than just a porridge of digressions and chance meetings that happen in front of his lens. For there is much he comes across by accident. </p> <p>It's clear that he sought out cancer patients, such as the one who recommends morphine to everybody who is trying to quit smoking; and tobacco farmers, such as the woman whose mother, a heavy smoker, died of lung cancer. (She says: \"My growing tobacco has nothing to do with my mother's dying. It has nothing to do with anyone who dies.\") But it was pure coincidence, McElwee tells me, that he came across the last ever tobacco festival in a small North Carolina town, and met the last Miss Tobacco. </p> <p>Nor could the director have known, when he arranged to meet the noted film theorist Vlada Petric at a film festival to talk about Bright Leaf, that Petric would put him in a wheelchair and push him along as he lectured him. But it ended up as one of the film's most memorable, and funny, scenes. \"As we circle the block for the fifth time, I find myself wondering how I managed to get myself in this situation,\" narrates McElwee, \"bound in the chair and lectured at close range by a rabid film theorist.\" </p> <p>At one point, McElwee leaves his cheap motel room and begins compulsively filming objects of striking banality in the parking lot. \"Sometimes, I feel it's such a pleasure to film, especially down south, that it almost doesn't matter what I'm filming,\" he narrates, in his hypnotically smooth southern baritone. \"Even just shooting around a motel can be an almost narcotic experience. I mean, I don't want to force an analogy but come to think of it, for me, filming is not unlike smoking a cigarette.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Bright Leaves is released on October 8.</p>",
  "<p>A few months ago I was offered an acting job that caused me some alarm. Now, film acting isn't usually an alarming job, especially if you portray a subsidiary villain or a henchman. In these circumstances you just show up the day before you're needed and hang around, in a hotel or trailer, occasionally being brought to the set to threaten innocents or be outsmarted. </p> <p>On a film set, as is only right and proper, the focus is on the principal actors, and most of the day is spent awaiting, beautifying and recording them. Subsidiary villains, henchmen, and moustachioed police detectives tend to be left till late in the afternoon, when the light is starting to fail, which means our scenes are normally master shots, rather than more time-consuming close-ups. Which is - provided you've learned your lines - a swift and stress-free way to work. I have hustled through scenes in which the light was fading fast in the US, Mexico, Liverpool, and Spain. It has always been delightful. So my anxiety was caused not by the job, but by the location. </p> <p>The film was called Rosario Tijeras, a French-Spanish-Mexican co-production, and it was being filmed in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. My impression of Colombia (a country I'd never been to before) was of a fiefdom of the Pentagon, where trade unionists were murdered, death squads ran riot, and gringo actors never trod. If I went, I would either be kidnapped, or arrested on charges trumped up by the CIA. The more I thought about it, the less I wanted to go, and so I told the production that the dates were difficult. This, inevitably, made them want me more, and they changed the dates to accommodate me. So, having run out of excuses, I flew from London to Madrid, from Madrid to Bogot\u00e1, and from Bogot\u00e1 to Medell\u00edn, to play the gringo Donovan, head of a drug cartel. </p> <p>Reading the script in my hotel, though, I was unable to find Donovan's part. Rosario Tijeras is the story of a beautiful young girl, named after a pair of scissors, who becomes a leading light in the Medell\u00edn narco-world: the film is set when the trade and its practitioners were at their most ostentatious, in the 1980s. Rosario had a great role, ruining several men in her precipitous career, and there were other decent characters from the acting viewpoint. But no Donovan. </p> <p>Next day on set, I sought out the director, Emilio Maill\u00e9, to ask where Donovan was. I had worked out an elaborate rationale for why the leader of this particular cartel was a gringo, and was sure his scenes' omission was an oversight. \"Not at all,\" Emilio told me, beaming: \"You've been reading an old script, in which your character was called Rodriguez. When we heard you were coming, naturally, we changed the name.\" </p> <p>It seemed to me that some of the actors in a dining room scene were whispering. I asked the director about this. Emilio told me that he wanted all the acting to be \"subtil\". Subtle acting? From someone whose only training has been The Art of Coarse Acting? I walked back to the hotel and read Rodriguez's scenes. </p> <p>Rosario Tijeras is a mini-epic spanning several years. I would be lying if I said that Rodriguez/Donovan has a lot to do with it. Basically, he and Rosario have three scenes. In one, he sits in a disco and beckons in a sinister fashion to our heroine. In another, they get on a plane bound for Miami. In the third, he and Rosario are by the pool: he insults her, and she stabs him with a knife. </p> <p>Rosario is played by Flora Mart\u00ednez, a Colombian New Yorker who is both beautiful and a proper actress. I knew none of the cast - most of them Colombians from Bogot\u00e1 - though I'd worked with some of the Mexican crew before, and had met the director and the producer, Matthias Ehrenberg, in Mexico City. </p> <p>My first couple of days were spent getting costumed at different bodegas in the south end of the city. The director's desire that I be subtle had not been conveyed to the wardrobe department, and on my first day of shooting - at the Olaya Herrera Airport - they presented me with a multicoloured polyester shirt, pointy black shoes, two- tone shades, and tons of gold chains and jewellery. Though not subtle, it was certainly effective, and much enjoyed by the guards at the airport gate. But Emilio didn't fancy the look, and had me fitted out with a more restrained guayabera and monotone aviators instead. </p> <p>During my time off, I took to walking down to the metro station and riding the spotless public transport into town. There is a modern art museum in the city centre, with a floor dedicated to Fernando Botero's paintings and sculpture. This isn't just the innocent-fat-people-art we see in European museums: there's a painting of a car bomb exploding and another of a sky full of devils, plus a quasi-religious miniature entitled La Muerte de Pablo Escobar - celebrating the demise of Medell\u00edn's most famous drug dealer, who had himself made a senator, and who funded many civic works. It soon became apparent that the greatest danger I faced wasn't a car bomb or a death squad kidnapping, but being run over: they drive faster and more aggressively in Medell\u00edn than anywhere else I've been. </p> <p>One day we filmed in the home of a former drug lord, since extradited to the US. It was in a private apartment building, high in the hills overlooking the city. There were four huge apartments, one on top of the other, each with its own enormous pool. Can you estimate how much a swimming pool full of water weighs? Now imagine four of them, one on top of the other, and you start to get an idea of the massive strength of the construction, and of the money that went into it. It made the drug lord's pad in Clear and Present Danger look like a country cottage. And it was real. </p> <p>I had a great time, drunkenly harassing Flora in her hot-pink bathing suit and doing laps in the ex-drug-kingpin's pool. Donovan, naturally, swam wearing his Rolex and gold chains. And by the end of the day, after sitting on this man's patio, swimming in his pool and viewing his modern art collection, I started to feel sorry for him - residing as he now does in a supermax-security jail cell, 3m by 3m, somewhere in the US. </p> <p>No doubt the guy was a bastard and a murderer, and a seller of drugs. But people in the US and Europe bought those drugs, and smoked or snorted them, entirely voluntarily. We hear about the Escobars being shot to death and the Ochoas extradited, but what about the Donovans? We know the names of the Colombian and Mexican bad guys, but what of the white men making even bigger profits from the trade in England and the US? Somehow, their names remain unknown. </p> <p>Donovan's last scene was shot in an abandoned, ruined factory. Here Salvador Parra, the great Mexican production designer, had made a replica of El Acuarius, a famous disco from the 1980s. This was the era of gold chains and overt drug money, and the scene was a private party, thrown by the narcos, for 200 of their closest friends. And everybody was dressed entirely in white. Not just Rosario, and Donovan, and our respective entourages, but the entire cast, and all 200 extras. This wasn't an eccentric design choice of Parra's, it turned out: they really did all dress like this, back at those 1980s Medell\u00edn narco parties (white - like coca, get it?). </p> <p>I was quite touched by this demented scene. In spite of all the gangsterism, and the killing, I was charmed by the sheer naffness of it. It was, in a very weird way, innocent. Which I think is the point of Rosario Tijeras: that innocence coexists with corruption and cruelty, at least for a while. </p> <p>On my last night in Medell\u00edn, I chatted with the local producer, about the possibility of some kind of peace settlement in the country, and about his plans for the film, which - despite its multinational provenance - he thought of as distinctly homegrown. He talked about plans for the premiere, and I found myself angling for an invitation to attend the gala do, some time in 2005. </p> <p>He had great hopes for Rosario Tijeras, a low-budget, Spanish-speaking picture about to enter the great, cold world of big-budget, American-speaking films. Maybe he was overly optimistic, like a Medell\u00edn kid dreaming of the high life, or those drug lords, piling swimming pools on top of each other and putting their own money into one of the cleanest and most efficient metro systems I have ever ridden. </p> <p>I didn't know what to make of it, either, when the Colombian producer mentioned offhand that I and most of the other foreign crew were completely safe on the streets of Medell\u00edn because nobody knew us. Whereas he had to move into a hotel when the filming took place, because everyone knew he had money, and he risked being kidnapped for ransom every time he went home. It didn't seem to worry him unduly. No more than the homicidal drivers, anyway. </p> <p>I don't know how the film has turned out or will turn out. It seemed to mean a lot at the time, particularly to the Colombians - who were putting in long hours for little money because this wasn't an advert, or a soap opera, but a feature film, and the distinction was something to be proud of. British and European film-makers complain about similar things, but we don't have to do our work in circumstances that are remotely similar. </p> <p>The news we get about Colombia continues to be bad: another trade unionist murdered, another peace community attacked, more money from the EU for the US-sponsored war. This had set me up to expect a bad experience, or at least an alienating one. Instead, I had a profitable and educational time, and even, maybe, a cause for optimism in the ghastly Sargasso sea of sunk hopes that is the world of feature films. </p> <p>So, if there are any other producers thinking of filming in war-torn but lovely countries, and looking for a drug lord or a subsidiary henchman, I still have the white suit and the fake, waterlogged Rolex ...</p>",
  "Gordon Brown sent a personal message of support to the prime minister last night as the chancellor's closest advisers refused to speculate on whether Mr Blair's declaration that he would serve a full third term would deny their man thejob he craves. <p>Mr Brown, who is in Washington for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and G7 finance ministers, had believed that Mr Blair would step down before the next election, let alone announce that he intended to stay in Downing Street another five years. </p> <p>Relations between the two have been rocky in recent months and the Blairites appeared to have kept the Brownites out of the loop during this week's Labour conference in Brighton. </p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Brown, 53, said last night: \"The chancellor of the exchequer arrived in Washington this evening for the G7 meeting and the annual meeting of the IMF but his thoughts will be with the prime minister throughout the weekend and this evening he sent Tony a personal message of support.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown was on a plane to Washington as the news started to filter out in London. He knew nothing about the announcement until his staff started taking calls when his flight touched down at Dulles airport an hour and a half before the news broke. </p> <p>Treasury officials said Mr Brown would have nothing to add at this stage to the statement released on his behalf in London. </p> <p>The chancellor showed no signs of being thrown out of his stride.</p> <p>At a meeting with church groups and development campaigners he greeted everyone personally before reiterating the call he made at the Labour party conference for a big increase in aid to the developing world. </p> <p>\"Instead of a world economy that works for some of the people some of the time, we need a world economy that works for all the people all of the time,\" he said. </p> <p>The absence of a treasury welcome for the PM's full third term will be seen in Westminster as evidence of Mr Brown's frustration that Mr Blair publicly stated he intended to go on until what would in all likelihood be 2009. </p> <p>Some of Mr Brown's allies were dismayed that he did not challenge the prime minister this year when Mr Blair faced defeat on higher university tuition fees until the chancellor persuaded MPs in his camp to support the plan. </p> <p>Mr Brown's political career was said to have been likened to \"a Shakespearan tragedy\" by Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair's chief of staff, who predicted he would never get the top job. </p> <p>He has been seen as a leader-in-waiting for 10 years and, if Mr Blair did serve a third term, would almost certainly see his own ambitions thwarted by cabinet rivals and rising stars in junior ministerial ranks challenging him in if it came to a contest. </p> <p>According to a well-placed Westminster source, Mr Brown and John Prescott were told at a dinner in November last year, hosted by the deputy prime minister in his grace-and-favour Admiralty House apartment, that Mr Blair would resign before the next election. </p> <p>The prime minister, insisted the source, said he would step down this autumn because he believed he would never recover trust with the electorate lost over the failure to discover weapons of mass destruction to justify the invasion and occupation of Iraq. </p> <p>The claim was denied at the apex of the government, along with an assertion from the same source that in March and early April Mr Blair had several conversations with the chancellor to discuss a plan to pre-announce that he would go this autumn. </p> <p>Mr Blair, it was said, thought an announcement would end speculation and give the Labour party six months to decide who would be his successor. Mr Brown, it was also said, thought he had talked the premier not out of quitting but of giving notice that he intended to go, arguing that Mr Blair should follow Harold Wilson, who in March 1976 took the country by surprise when he resigned. </p> <p>The prime minister's departure, according to the well connected source, pre-dated the personal crisis of April 19 recently disclosed by the author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, a family friend, which the UK media are prohibited from discussing in detail. </p> <p>The first occasion Mr Brown believed he was cheated of the Labour crown by Mr Blair was in May 1994 after the death of the party leader, John Smith. As Mr Brown grieved, Mr Blair and his allies were accused of planning the succession. </p> <p>After several weeks of agonising Mr Brown, who clearly felt he was the senior figure in a partnership then referred to as Brown-Blair instead of the current Blair-Brown, agreed not to seek the job, at a dinner on May 31 1994 at Granita, a then fashionable restaurant in Islington, north London. </p> <p>Mr Blair agreed under the Granita pact to give his chancellor control of the Treasury and influence over domestic policy beyond that of previous occupants of 11 Downing Street. </p> <p>Brownites maintain - and Blairites deny - that under the Granita pact the prime minister promised to step down in the middle of this parliament and back Mr Brown as his successor. </p> <p>Asked in an interview for last Saturday's Guardian Weekend magazine whether he thought Mr Blair had betrayed him, Mr Brown replied: \"I'm not going to answer that. It's not helpful.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown had been urged by some supporters to stand against John Smith in 1992 when Neil Kinnock stood down after a second election defeat but deferred to his mentor. </p> <p><b>Runners and riders: from arch moderniser to mother of four</b></p> <p><b> Alan Milburn, 50 in 2008</b> </p> <p>Will be seen as the outright moderniser and if he helps secure Mr Blair a third term as election planner he will be well placed. Has some of Mr Blair's charm and normality. But he has not made any decision to return to frontline politics permanently, and could even step down again to spend more time with his family </p> <p><b> Jack Straw, 62 in 2008</b> </p> <p>Seen as a success as foreign secretary, though he never expected the job. A politician to his fingertips, he has been seen as close to Gordon Brown in recent years, and might not want to challenge him. He has no party base, but has taken to wearing contact lenses, seen by some as a sign of a man grooming his image </p> <p><b> John Reid, 61 in 2008</b> </p> <p>Already promised that he will not allow Mr Brown to take over the leadership as part of a succession. A former communist, and adviser to Neil Kinnock, he is capable of going 15 rounds with the Today programme but also seen as the philosopher king of New Labour. He can organise and has a strong Scottish base </p> <p><b> David Miliband, 43 in 2008</b> </p> <p>Already dubbed the man most likely to take over if the party wanted to skip a generation. He has run the policy unit at No 10, he thinks widely and has cultivated backbenchers. As schools minister, he has given a strong set of speeches. He will need to be shifted into the cabinet quickly if he is to have any serious prospect </p> <p><b> Ruth Kelly, 40 in 2008</b> </p> <p>Marked out when she was appointed Alan Milburn's deputy, she is expected to take a high profile role in the election.

  "A British woman allegedly raped during her childhood on the Pitcairn islands has told a sex abuse trial that men on the remote outcrop treated young girls as playthings. <p>On the opening day of the historic trial in which seven men face charges, the woman said she had been repeatedly raped by Steve Christian, now the island's mayor, the first time when she was 11 or 12 years old. </p> <p>In video testimony given from Auckland, more than 3,000 miles away, the prosecution witness broke down several times as she described how she had been taunted on the island for being a \"half-caste\" and said she had been raped four times by Mr Christian. </p> <p>\"It seemed to be the normal way of life on Pitcairn - how the girls were treated as though they were sex things,\" the woman said. </p> <p>She said there was no one she or her parents could turn to on the island after the rapes. It was the norm on Pitcairn to keep quiet. </p> <p>Defence lawyers said other witnesses would contradict the woman's claims that she was bullied at school and that sex simulation games took place at island gatherings. </p> <p>Mr Christian, 53, is accused of raping another girl and having unlawful consensual sex with two more between 1964 and 1975. </p> <p>Six other men are also in the dock. </p> <p>A second trial got under way yesterday in which the accused, Dave Brown, faced 15 charges of indecency and indecent assault, including one referring to an incident in which he was alleged to have assaulted a girl aged seven in church. </p> <p>Christine Gordon, prosecuting, told the court: \"That charge demonstrates an attitude that pervades Mr Brown's offending: that young girls were available for him as and when he chose.\" </p> <p>The hearing is controversial because it applies British law, which prohibits sex with minors, to a community where underage sex has apparently been a standard feature of life. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Pooled material was used in this report</p>",
  "The prime minister's announcement that he will not go on and on sends out political shockwaves. All political careers end sometime - but in Britain the time of going is usually unknown. This ends the always unrealistic speculation that he might stand down before the next election - but it creates an unfamiliar fixed time frame for an end to his era, presumably in about 2007 to give his successor time. News of his physical weakness surprises after a week in which he yet again established his mastery over his party and saw off rebellion over Iraq. <p>It was a curious conference, though. One minister told me on the first day that their local party was \"heartbroken over Iraq\" and at first that mood was in the Brighton air. But this week has felt like watching a couple getting a long-standing marriage back together after an act of infidelity, a betrayal that will never be quite forgiven or forgotten yet has been overcome. And so they came through. </p> <p>I write before knowing the Hartlepool result: if he has scraped through that too, he's a lucky man - the quality Napoleon prized most in his generals. If the Lib Dems did squeeze past, that's another blow (but as an omen for the general election, it remains rather worse for the Tories who were second last time to sink to third or fourth now.) </p> <p>Whatever that result, he does return to Downing Street still permanently winged by Iraq. What has it done to him? Some say it has unhinged him: after seven years no leader is quite sane, no longer quite on our planet. Others look ahead and see how it has forced him to hand his ministers more control over shaping the third term, no bad thing. Both these may be true - but it all depends whether he is talking about home or abroad. </p> <p>At present he talks very little sense about abroad. What is Britain's foreign policy for the third term? Nothing he says reflects a believable vision of the country's place in the world. </p> <p>Consider his earnest pledge at a Muslim Council of Britain fringe meeting, talking about the need for a Middle East peace plan: \"It is absolutely vital that we revive and restart the process. I can assure you I will do everything I can. I regard it as a priority, I regard it as something that I will feel a sense of personal failure over if we cannot get movement back into this process.\" </p> <p>Personal failure? Foreign policy is not a one-man mission, as many said when he rashly promised that the road to Iraq was on a twin track with the roadmap to Middle East peace. He seems to have forgotten his humiliation in the White House rose garden when President Bush shafted any idea of a roadmap by signing up to Sharon's unilateral plan. As a result, destabilised Palestine is imploding in despair. </p> <p>So how will he avoid \"personal failure\" this time? Bush looks set to be back in the White House, but despite the high cost of the political support Tony Blair gave him, there is plentiful evidence already of how little leverage Britain has. In the conference speech, Tony Blair felt obliged to repeat what an intelligent man must know is breath-taking Pentagon nonsense about the nature of global terror. </p> <p>As for Europe, even with leadership of the EU and G8 coming his way next year, his weakened influence post-Iraq will take another hard hit if he fails to get Britain to sign up to the EU constitution. He has done nothing so far to persuade the British people while his Chancellor's speech had nothing but insults for the EU, hardly a winning ploy. </p> <p>Hopes that John Kerry might save him are fading. But even if Kerry won, he owes Tony Blair no favours, no reason to make London his first port of call in Europe. So forget the \"bridge\": neither America nor Europe beckons. He lacks any credible language to speak about either. </p> <p>But turn to the home front and here is the mirror image. Here is indeed a good \"forward offer\", the unfortunate phrase of the moment. In Brighton minister after minister stepped up to display a third term agenda of conviction and ambition, an array of promises fulfilled, plans for the next term and a wise humility about how much harder it is than they realised to make real change happen out there on the ground. Try to imagine how this would look now, if only there had been no Iraq war. Even hostile observers might grudgingly acknowledge how well Labour is now sustaining and renewing itself in office. If only there had been no war. </p> <p>New directions? Here are a sample six totemic policy changes drenched in Labour heartland tradition. To be sure, a braver Labour should have done them long ago, but all six put right old wrongs. </p> <p>There will be no more selection for specialist schools, allowed until now to choose 10% of their pupils by \"aptitude\". </p> <p>It looks certain that private schools and hospitals will at last lose their charitable status (though some may earn other tax breaks). </p> <p>Real House of Lords reform will happen at last - with 80% elected, probably by Billy Bragg's formula. </p> <p>Pension reform is set to tilt back in favour of bigger basic state pensions for all - more popular if not fairer. Invalidity benefit will not be arbitrarily capped - but a New Deal with more carrot than stick can help the despaired and unfit find jobs. </p> <p>A change that attracts less notice, yet affects millions of working lives ends the two-tier workforce that lets private contractors pay less than public service rates to their cleaners, porters and carers: they will all now get the NHS \u00a35.69 an hour. This may mean hospitals and schools bring their manual staff back in to better pay and career ladders. </p> <p>Finally, the NHS is vanquishing private medicine. The 1997 maximum waiting time for an operation was 18 months and now it is about to become 18 weeks. But it's even better than that: the pre-1997 \"wait\" excluded hidden time - often months - waiting to get a first appointment, for tests, and even waiting to get onto waiting lists. Now Labour's wait is honestly counted from first GP visit to climbing into bed - with an average down to six weeks by 2008. The result is that private medicine is losing patients so fast that private hospitals are closing. </p> <p>To be sure, Labour must answer deeper questions than those six ideology-laden totems. Will Britain be more socially just? Will children born under Labour get a better chance in life?

Will we be any nearer the heart of Europe where we belong?

  "<p>One of the most agonising dilemmas ever to come before a judge - whether a baby should live or die - was outlined starkly and emotively in the high court yesterday. Two parents seeking to do their utmost for their desperately ill daughter faced a procession of doctors insisting that the kindest thing they could do for her would be to let her slip away naturally. </p> <p>Mr Justice Headley, the judge who must take the decision, was told that it would be \"futile, or even cruel\" to put 11-month-old Charlotte Wyatt on a ventilator if she starts fighting for breath. </p> <p>Dr C, a consultant paediatric neurologist called as an expert witness by Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, told the judge that ventilation might have to be through a tracheostomy, inserting a breathing tube through the windpipe. </p> <p>The doctors caring for Charlotte at the trust insist it would be in her best interests to let her die. But her parents, Darren and Debbie, both devout Christians, want her to be put on a ventilator if, as she inevitably will, she develops breathing problems again. </p> <p>Yesterday, across a courtroom at the Royal Courts of Justice, they heard the doctors say that subjecting her to any more aggressive intervention would be, in one consultant's words, \"purposeless and therefore intolerable to her\". </p> <p>The parents' hopes were dealt a blow towards the end of the day when their own expert witness, an intensive care expert identified only as called Dr F, told the court that ventilation, while acceptable if the parents insisted, would be \"cruel and invasive\" if continued after five days with no improvement. </p> <p>Charlotte's lungs are already scarred from five earlier ventilations after she stopped breathing. She is fed through a tube because she cannot suck and needs a constant supply of oxygen. </p> <p>Paediatricians say she will not survive beyond infancy and will never leave St Mary's hospital, just a few streets away from the family's flat in Portsmouth, which has been her home since she was born three months prematurely last October, measuring only five inches (12.7cms) and weighing only one pound (0.54kgms). She still weighs only 12lbs. </p> <p>The trust took the case to court for a ruling that it would be in Charlotte's best interests to allow her to die in peace and not to put her on a ventilator a sixth time. </p> <p>Doctors told Mr Wyatt, 33, and his 23-year-old wife - who is expecting their third child - that, in the event of another crisis they were prepared to keep her alive long enough for them to attend at her bedside, but insisted it would be against the baby's interests to ventilate her again. </p> <p>The couple have a two-year-old son Daniel and Mr Wyatt has three children, aged 13, 12 and eight, from a previous marriage. </p> <p>David Lock, counsel for the trust, told Mr Justice Headley: \"Both the clinicians and the parents want the best for Charlotte, but there is a divergence about what would be in her best interests.\" </p> <p>He said the clinicians caring for Charlotte had summed up her quality of life as \"both terrible and permanent\". She had suffered severe respiratory failure, requiring ventilation for the first three months of her life, very poor weight gain, a heart abnormality, recurrent urinary tract infections and worsening kidney function. Since a recent severe infection, she had exhibited a profound and persistent deterioration in her respiratory and neurological function. Her brain was hardly growing. </p> <p>Mr Lock said a consultant paediatric neurologist had stated that Charlotte \"has no visual awareness and does not respond to sound ... she does not respond to being cuddled and demonstrates no awareness of familiar persons\". Another doctor reported that Charlotte fell into the most extreme category in terms of profound neurological handicap, he said. If she survived she would have a \"terrible quality of life, dominated by pain and suffering without much joy or fulfilment\". </p> <p>The doctor stated: \"If ventilatory care merely produces a large amount of suffering for Charlotte, which it undoubtedly will, then if this is undertaken merely to result in an insensate, non-volitional existence for Charlotte, this in my opinion is intolerable.\" </p> <p>Dr E, a consultant paediatrician with a special interest in respiratory medicine who took over supervising Charlotte's care in August, told the court that the baby had another infection this week and was \"very distressed\" for much of Monday. Charlotte was suffering from \"the worst case of chronic lung disease I have ever seen\" and was now having \"as much oxygen as we can deliver\". He described how Charlotte had received life-saving ventilation five times and had suffered lung scarring as a result. This had set up a \"vicious circle\", making it more difficult for her to breathe. Ventilation to keep her alive would be \"intolerable - full of pain and suffering\". </p> <p>Mr Wolfe said that both parents and a consultant paediatrician, Dr G, had recently visited Charlotte. She had been taken out of her oxygen box and cuddled by her parents and had \"settled\" in response. Dr G had also stroked her and she settled. </p> <p>Dr E replied that Dr G had seen her \"on a very good day\" for a couple of hours at the most. Much of the time she was in \"a very distressed state\". </p> <p>Mr Wolfe said the parents would like to look forward to taking Charlotte out \"so that she can have the feel of fresh air on her skin\". They also believed that stroking and cuddling her had a calming effect. </p> <p>Dr C said: \"The possibility of her ever having any independent cognitive life - there is no possibility. Even if she does not have distressing physical symptoms, she will never be able to recognise familiar people or communicate. She will be functioning at a very, very basic level.\" </p> <p>The case returns to court today, when the judge could give his decision, possibly reserving his reasons till later. </p> <p><strong>How the law has been invoked</strong></p> <p><strong> 1981</strong> A girl, B, was born with Down's syndrome and an intestinal blockage curable by a simple operation but otherwise fatal. Her parents refused to consent to the operation. Doctors contacted social services who initially failed to persuade a high court judge that the operation should be carried out, but succeeded on appeal. </p> <p><strong> 1992</strong> In a case similar to Charlotte Wyatt's, the mother of a 16-month-old boy lost a court battle against doctors who refused to put him on a ventilator. The boy was paralysed, blind, epileptic and had to be fed through a tube. He reacted to sound, water and touch but was prone to fits and breathing problems. The court agreed with doctors that a ventilator would cause him distress and pain. </p> <p><strong> 1995</strong> Ten-year-old Jaymee Bowen's father, David, fought through the courts to force Cambridge health authority to continue treating her for leukaemia. The authority refused to pay \u00a375,000 for special treatment after doctors said the chances of success were slim. An anonymous donor paid for the treatment but Jaymee died a year later at the age of 11. </p> <p><strong> 1996</strong> The court of appeal upheld a mother's refusal to allow her 18-month-old son to undergo a lifesaving liver transplantation. She is believed to have reconsidered and let him have the operation. </p> <p><strong> 2000</strong> The court of appeal ruled that the conjoined twins Jodie and Mary could be separated despite the objections of their parents. The operation meant inevitable death for Mary. </p> <p><strong> 2004</strong> There was a human rights violation ruling against doctors from the Portsmouth NHS trust caring for Charlotte Wyatt. They gave David Glass, 12, diamorphine to ease his predicted death. Relatives resuscitated him. Now 18, he is living with his family.</p>",
  "Independent schools and private hospitals would be stripped of their much-prized charitable status under proposals yesterday from a parliamentary committee chaired by Alan Milburn, the prime minister's manifesto co-ordinator. <p>Fee-charging schools would be regarded as a normal service industry, but given special tax breaks if they could prove they offered quantifiable public benefits. </p> <p>The proposal came in the report of a joint committee of MPs and peers which has been scrutinising the government's draft charities bill. </p> <p>The report was masterminded by Mr Milburn, although he was absent from the final session of the committee at which it was formally approved - a week after he rejoined the cabinet on September 8. </p> <p>The MPs and peers said their plan was radical and attractive, \"not least in removing the confusion and controversy surrounding the charitable status of private schools.\" </p> <p>They concluded: \"We believe the government should consider reviewing the charitable status of independent schools and hospitals with a view to considering whether the best long-term solution might lie in those organisations ceasing to be charities, but receiving favourable tax treatment in exchange for clear demonstration of quantified public benefits.\" </p> <p>The draft bill had proposed that organisations should have to pass a public benefit test if they wanted to retain charitable status. However, the MPs and peers discovered that Fiona Mactaggart, the charities minister, was at loggerheads with the Charity Commission over the implications for private schools. </p> <p>Ms Mactaggart said schools should be subjected to the full rigour of the test, but the commission said their status was entrenched by case law and could not be taken away by statute. </p> <p>After Mr Milburn described the situation as \"a dog's break fast\", the commission accepted the minister's interpretation. But the report yesterday suggested that MPs and peers thought more radical legislation was needed to resolve the issue. </p> <p>It also proposed tax exemption on a large slice of charities' trading income. Professional fundraisers would have to make their status clear to the public, the MPs and peers said. </p> <p>Ms Mactaggart said: \"There is widespread support for the principle that public benefit should be the bedrock of charitable status.\" </p> <p>The Independent Schools Council, representing 1,280 private schools, said they offered significant public benefit and could prove it. </p> <p>The report noted the definition of public benefit in a statement agreed by the Home Office and the Charity Commission. This said fee-charging schools and hospitals would fail the test if they \"wholly excluded poor people from any benefits\".</p>",
  "<p>The decision by the Russian government to ratify the Kyoto Treaty on climate change yesterday promises to kickstart a multibillion-dollar global emissions trading industry - based in London. </p> <p>The price of CO2 in Europe rose 20% to nearly \u20ac10 (\u00a37) per tonne on the back of the news from Moscow last night, and many industry experts predict further gains with massive new volumes changing hands. </p> <p>More than 1m tonnes of carbon were traded in September - double the figure for all of 2003. Some are forecasting annual volumes will grow to 8m tonnes or even 10m tonnes by the end of 2004. </p> <p>Experts predict that before long new dealing facilities will be developed that could replicate the commodities bourses such as the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) and the London Metal Exchange. </p> <p>There has been buying and selling of carbon for a number of years in London and other cities but in a low-key way. </p> <p>It has been growing faster in recent months in anticipation of legally binding environmental legislation. The European Union has developed national allocations for greenhouse gas emissions but the Russian decision triggers the introduction of global international regulations from 2008. </p> <p>Henrik Hasselknippe, senior analyst with emissions trading consultant Point Carbon, believes Russia alone could earn up to $10bn from selling quotas on the carbon market. </p> <p>He estimates the financial value of the European carbon market will be worth \u20ac10bn (\u00a36.9bn) a year by 2007. </p> <p>\"This [the Russian decision] is the most important news we have heard for many years. </p> <p>\"It gives greater certainty to the [carbon] market and should really provide the kickstart we have been waiting for,\" he said. </p> <p>Kate Hampton, manager of marketing and policy at London-based consultant Climate Change Capital, describes yesterday's decision as \"hugely important\" for emissions trading. </p> <p>\"We are now going to see the more reticent countries in Europe take a more robust line and it will activate a series of mechanisms such as the trading of permits between governments.\" </p> <p>With the US refusing to ratify Kyoto, the treaty has needed a country as large as Russia to achieve the critical mass to become binding. </p> <p>Russia accounts for 17% of total emissions from industrialised countries - 5.6% of global emissions - and brings the industrialised emissions covered by the treaty to 61.6%. </p> <p>At present countries responsible for 65% of global emissions have signed up to the treaty leaving one major exception, the US, which accounts for 20% and is the world's largest single polluter. Russia has to stabilise its emissions at 1990 levels, but political instability and reduced industrial output has seen CO2 output dropping 30% over the last 14 years. This means Russia has vast volumes of quotas to sell into the global emissions market, said Mr Hasselknippe. </p> <p>Leading energy companies such as BP, Shell and RWE in Germany, have been among the most active in the trading of permits to date. Last night BP described Russia's decision as \"helpful\". </p> <p>Just as large financial institutions have started to play a big role in trading oil contracts on the IPE, so have they started to make an appearance trading emissions. </p> <p>Like the oil markets, a network of specialist brokers is beginning to grow around the business with names such as Ecosecurities and Natsource. </p> <p>The relative values of CO2 transactions are still minuscule compared with the oil markets but they are expected to grow from \u20ac96m worth of carbon trades globally last year to \u20ac360m for 2004. </p> <p>Oil prices in recent years have fluctuated from $9 per barrel to $50, but no one can predict what will happen to carbon values. Climate Change Capital believes prices could drop from yesterday's level and bounce about depending on issues such as the relative prices of coal and gas, the influence of the weather on power production and general levels of economic development. </p> <p>So emissions trading might be new, but market characteristics are likely to be familiar.</p>",
  "\"If no one seems to understand,\" Billy Bragg used to sing, \"start your own revolution.\" It seems the pop star/political activist has done exactly that. As Labour's party conference broke up yesterday, Lord Falconer, the secretary of state for constitutional affairs, promised delegates there would be a manifesto commitment to completing Lords reform. It is Bragg's idea of a secondary mandate, where votes cast in a general election would be used to determine a regionally based membership of an upper house, that looks like providing a route through the wreckage of earlier attempts to achieve a democratic second chamber. <p>Ten years ago, it would have seemed ridiculous that reform would not be completed by a third Labour term. But it would have seemed equally daft to speculate about a third Labour term. Tony Blair was right: there aren't a lot of votes in the constitution. Nonetheless, nervousness about a head-on confrontation with the existing members of the upper house has left the government looking more interested in obstructing than facilitating reform. Yesterday, all that changed. Lord Falconer was vague about the detail, but sure about the approach. Reform will be a priority for the new government. It will extend to some reshaping of the powers of the upper house (probably the introduction of timetabling, to prevent the kind of procrastination that has stymied some of the government's plans in the past four years) and looks set to embrace indirect elections for the great majority of members. By making it a manifesto pledge, further delay in the Lords becomes constitutionally unacceptable.</p> <p>An indirectly elected upper house is not perfect. Members are likely to be chosen from a closed list, as in the Euro elections. That gives the parties an uncomfortable degree of control, although less so if it were decided to adopt Bragg's proposals for ordering candidates on the list by primary elections. There will also be arguments over the introduction of timetabling. Control of the hours spent in debate is a powerful weapon, as great parliamentarians like Michael Foot always knew, and at times when a government has an unassailable majority in the Commons, the second chamber's criticisms may be right even if at the moment they lack legitimacy. But it is reasonable to balance the increased authority bestowed by a degree of democracy with some diminution of the upper chamber's powers. This is a welcome advance from the absurdity of the current chamber. And once the principle of election is established, they can't take it away.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> It is just over three weeks before the PM's wife arrives in the US for her first speaking tour, and - bar the nailing down of a few complimentary Halliburton mugs - most of the arrangements are in place. We have no problem with the \u00a330,000-per-speech fee reportedly negotiated for Cherie by New York's Harry Walker agency. If organisations wish to spend that on a monologue about human rights law rather than blowing it on a depraved party like anyone normal would, well, that is a matter for them. However, the Diary is most reliably assured that Cherie will be accompanied on this highly lucrative jaunt by Special Branch officers, paid for - and this might not go against the grain of everything we've learned about the old girl over the years - by the taxpayer. Now, if one was expecting to pick up a quick \u00a3120,000 (the tour is planned as four consecutive dates), and to keep all the proceeds, insisting it is nothing whatsoever to do with one's role as the PM's wife, ought one, in all conscience, to keep hand and pocket apart where bodyguards are concerned? Downing Street, naturally, declines to comment, so perhaps a leading ethicist, or even a child of five, would contact us to discuss whether this is very seemly. <p><b>\u00b7</b> Only yesterday we speculated on the specific inadequacy which drove Tory London assembly chair Brian Coleman to reinstate not only the ceremonial gold chain worn by the GLC leader, but to voice himself \"inclined to seek the reputed mace\" at a recent meeting.

Passers-by in a GLA corridor on Wednesday were treated to the sight of Brian returning from an external meeting. \"I can't be expected to travel on the tube if I'm wearing this,\" he fumed, pointing to the aforementioned chain. \"It's about time I had an official car, and that's what I'll be asking for.\" And it's not all he's asking for, is it? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> You won't believe it, but there was a shocking mistake in our series of university reminiscences about Sir Ivor Roberts, the British ambassador to Rome, whose private comment about Bush being al-Qaida's recruiting sergeant became unfortunately public.

  "After decades of vowing \"no surrender\", the hardline Unionist leader Ian Paisley yesterday made an historic journey south of the Northern Ireland border for his first political meeting with an Irish prime minister in Dublin. <p>The talks were a symbolic step in Northern Ireland's intricate political dance to restore devolution before Tony Blair's tentative deadline of Christmas.

  "<p>When Harvey Weinstein used the film Fahrenheit 9/11 to detonate the relationship between Miramax and its corporate parent, the Walt Disney Company, he may well have gotten more than he bargained for. In Weinstein's hands, Michael Moore's anti-Bush missile became a suicide bomb, just as likely to destroy the Miramax co-chair as to shake up Disney. To Disney CEO Michael Eisner, after harbouring Harvey for over a decade, it must have felt like that classic scene in the original Alien where the creature - its glistening, mucoidal tentacles flailing wildly - bursts through the chest of an unlucky crew member. Now that the thing is loose, the question is: what now? </p> <p>Ever since Jeffrey Katzenberg, then Disney chairman, put out the first feelers to Miramax on April Fool's Day, 1993, Miramax has been regarded as a foreign body within the Disney organism, always in danger of being rejected. When the deal was consummated a short time later, industry pundits raised their eyebrows. It was hard to imagine two companies whose cultures were less suited to each other. Disney stood for everything the Weinsteins hated, or claimed to hate. Bob Weinstein had been quoted as saying: \"We don't want to grow up and be another Walt Disney.\" </p> <p>Disney was, after all, the family-friendly, white-bread home of Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse, while Miramax had prospered by fanning the flames of controversy. What would Uncle Walt have made of the wild Jews from Queens, or their films-shockers such as The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, or Reservoir Dogs, with its famous ear-slicing sequence. Or even their huge hit, The Crying Game, with its jaw-dropping anatomical surprise? It seemed clear that this was a marriage of convenience, not affection, and most observers predicted it would end in a messy divorce. But the deal they struck was so advantageous to both companies that the simmering feud between the two took more than a decade to boil over. </p> <p>Miramax was coming off two lean years. To many Hollywood players it looked as if the company was on the edge of bankruptcy, and the Disney offer was a godsend. Eisner, too, was highly motivated. He had been uneasily watching his competitors get a foothold in television. Says Katzenberg: \"Michael did not want to buy cable, he did not want to buy a network, because he felt we were too late. Our strategy was to extend our reach in terms of content. If we had a large enough control of the product being made, these so-called gatekeepers - the Rupert Murdochs, the Viacoms, the Time Warners that did own cable and network - would always have to deal with us. Miramax was the big building block in that strategy.\" It went beyond that, explains Chris McGurk, who was CFO at the time. \"We'd had a couple of years of poor performance and he probably saw Harvey as a backstop.\" </p> <p>For Disney, one of the most attractive things about Miramax was its business plan. \"The big cost in the movie business, once you've made the movie, is how much you spend on TV advertising, and they just didn't do that,\" says Joe Roth, who would become chairman of Disney after Katzenberg left in 1994. \"What they were brilliant at was not going into the field and spending $20m on TV until they knew it was going to work. So they didn't have movies that lost $30m, $40m, whereas other studios have four or five of them a year. And every year they had some kind of a breakout.\" </p> <p>From an economic standpoint, everything seemed to make sense right off the bat. Says McGurk: \"We laid out on a piece of paper how we would help Miramax take over the independent world and kill everybody.\" </p> <p>The deal was signed in the conference room of the Team Disney building. All told, it was worth something over $100m to Miramax. The Weinsteins were guaranteed autonomy. As Harvey puts it: \"If we lived within a cap of $12.5m per picture, nobody could tell us what to do.\" According to one source, when he returned to his New York office, he told the staff: \"I finally found someone to buy this shithole!\" </p> <p>But it wasn't long before the relationship between Disney and Miramax turned rocky. To Miramax, the Disney executives came off as arrogant suits. Jack Foley, the Weinsteins' distribution head recalls: \"You had this efficiency machine at Disney coming over into chaosville, saying, 'This is what you should do.' They put an audit on us, and the Disney auditors were truly the most Draconian, Machiavellian, Kafkaesque bureaucrats you'd ever want to meet in your life. They were trying to bash us.\" </p> <p>On the Disney side, almost everyone with whom the Weinsteins dealt, especially the middle-level executives, regarded them as little better than dog hair. McGurk says: \"Miramax was set up to be an autonomous business that lived outside the rules. To Disney executives they were this outlaw company that leeched off the Disney divisions and made the executives look bad because they were doing so well, so they hated that.\" Roth adds: \"Miramax acted like Disney was just another company, and to [them], it felt like they were being forced to support a competitor.\" </p> <p>Not only were Disney forced to piggyback Miramax product on to their own, they disliked the product, so different from what they were used to. Says one former Disney executive: \"Their packaging sucked; the trailers sucked; there was no awareness of their pictures, because they were never distributed in the small towns between the coasts. Plus, Bob and Harvey were disagreeable sons of bitches to talk to over the phone. If you're a salesman at Buena Vista Home Video, and your bonus is based on how much you sell, do you want to push The Lion King? Or do you want to push The Cook, the Thief? Their video business was like a booger on your finger that you couldn't flick off!\" </p> <p>At first, Eisner supported Harvey but, says Roth: \"They were enough alike to really not get along. They had some pretty big fights.\" As former Disney CFO Rob Moore puts it: \"People who did stuff for them, they liked, and people who didn't do stuff for them, they hated. You were their best friend or they wanted to run you over. There was no grey area with them.\" The Weinsteins showed up at a corporate retreat one year wearing T-shirts that read \"corporately irresponsible\", which pretty well summed up their attitude. </p> <p>In 1995, Miramax acquired a film, Priest, about a gay Catholic priest, which created a firestorm of protest: anti-semitic hate letters, death threats etc. Harvey had planned to release it on Good Friday. Some Disney executives were reportedly furious that Miramax had acquired the film in the first place, knowing they couldn't release an NC-17 movie. They took it personally. As one says: \"He was doing it just to fuck with Michael. I believe that they got extreme pleasure out biting the hand that fed them. Psychologically, it makes them think that they're still independent, that they didn't sell out to a large conglomerate. But they did. They traded money for freedom.\" Adds Roth: \"We had a couple of years - 1994, 95 - when it was rough going. The amount of controversy that was connected up to Disney was terrible. There was definitely a conversation about how do you continue a business and make a profit when you are so connected to these two guys.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, despite the spats - the raised voices, thrown dishes, and slammed doors - Miramax was making money, winning Oscars and beefing up its library. As Moore puts it: \"Miramax was delivering, and Disney was delivering.\" Both sides had strong incentives to make the arrangement work. Disney understood that without the Weinsteins, Miramax was just an empty shell. For their part, the brothers knew that Disney owned the ground they stood on, which is to say, the name and the library, and that financing them from scratch would be an expensive proposition for any other studio. </p> <p>Besides, their deal was structured so that if they were to walk, they would be leaving too much money on the table. They were milking the Disney cow in too many ways. At one point - after Priest, and then Kids, another controversial film - McGurk went to Eisner and asked: \"Hey, do you want me to go and sell Miramax? Because I would love to get a multiple of 10 on what we paid for it.\" Eisner responded: \"As long as I'm around, we're never selling that company.\" McGurk explains: \"He thought that they had built one of the best brands in the business, so all that talk of leaving was baloney, on both sides. Look what Disney did with their business. They couldn't get arrested from a profit standpoint before Disney bought them, and now they're making $150m a year.\" </p> <p>Cut to the early years of the new millennium, when the uneasy relationship between Eisner and Harvey had exploded into open warfare. What had changed? For one thing, Harvey's success had made him more ambitious. After the run of $100m hits in the middle of the 1990s, such as Pulp Fiction, The English Patient, Good Will Hunting, and Shakespeare in Love, Weinstein was no longer content to make small films that made small profits. He spoke directly about competing with the studios. On the last weekend of January, 1999, Miramax released She's All That, starring Freddie Prinze Jr, and won the weekend. According to director Kevin Smith, \"Harvey was incredibly proud\" of She's All That. He told Eisner: \"I wanted to prove to them that I could make a piece of shit and compete on their level. And I did.\" </p> <p>Ironically, it was Eisner who brought him up short, telling him that he should have released it through Dimension, Bob Weinstein's genre label. It was not a Miramax movie. Eisner had a substantial investment in the Miramax name, and he knew that Harvey's ego had committed a crime against the brand that was stupid and potentially costly. </p> <p>Eisner recognised that Harvey was not only doing the independent world a disservice, he was also sabotaging himself. By virtue of going toe-to-toe with the studios, Harvey began to deny himself the very advantages that had contributed to Miramax's success in the past. As McGurk puts it: \"The original business model was founded on them doing movies where the total investment was less than $15m, and generally less than $10m. If they found a diamond in the rough, like The English Patient, they could spend a lot of money on marketing and their overall investment would still be lower than the average. Now the average cost of a Miramax movie has got to be $30m, $40m, $50m. As they've gotten bigger and bigger, the old model might just as well be thrown in the waste basket.\" </p> <p>Harvey went on to lose at least $37m on Talk magazine, a venture he started in the face of Eisner's fierce opposition. He also financed a series of substantially budgeted, studio-type movies such as Kate and Leopold at $50-odd million, and Cold Mountain - essentially a story about a man walking home through the woods that could have been shot by the old Miramax for $2m - for more than $80m. Harvey even optioned the Green Hornet comic strip, which he intended as his very own Spider-Man. </p> <p>Nobody likes a loser, which is what Harvey was fast becoming. He went through a long drought, from Shakespeare in Love in 1998 to Chicago in 2003, producing a series of high-profile duds such as The Shipping News and Gangs of New York. Bob Weinstein was making the money, but even he was running out of steam. Meanwhile, Eisner was having his own troubles: Katzenberg's humiliating lawsuit, launched after he was denied promotion, which Eisner was forced to settle out of court for about $250m; the Mike Ovitz debacle and ensuing suit from stockholders, who were furious that Ovitz was hired and fired at great expense within 14 months; plunging profits at Disney; and a campaign to get rid of Eisner himself, run by Walt's nephew Roy Disney.Eisner and Harvey, like two wounded grizzly bears, turned on each other. </p> <p>The Weinsteins, who have always thought they could do a better job running Disney than Eisner and his team, became openly critical of the CEO's judgement, starting with his refusal to let Miramax produce Lord of the Rings. \"Let's not forget who was the guy who believed in it first,\" says Harvey, speaking of himself in the third person, \"and to his detriment couldn't get his own company to back his vision. With the way they exploit theme parks, that one decision cost the company maybe a billion dollars.\" </p> <p>The Weinsteins have been operating within an annual $700m budget cap. According to Harvey, Disney tried to lower the cap to $500m, in part by changing the formula by which foreign sales can be used to offset costs. From the Weinsteins' point of view, Disney started to nickel-and-dime them. \"They're in financial trouble, and they're trying to renegotiate the deal,\" Harvey says. It has always killed the Weinsteins to share the profits with anyone - agents, producers, investors, film-makers or employees - and this must have been doubly true of Disney. As Cassian Elwes, an agent, says: \"I'm sure at the back of their minds is that nagging thought that had they managed to remain independent and had the success that they've had over the last eight years, they'd be billionaires as opposed to multi-millionaires.\" </p> <p>Eisner ordered an audit of Miramax books in 2002 - such audits are annoying, if fairly common - but the Weinsteins retaliated by hiring two high-powered attorneys, Bert Field and David Boies, to find legal grounds for a counter-audit of the Disney books pertaining to their video and international TV distribution of Miramax product. \"They get to see my books all the time, so there's no hiding what we do,\" says Harvey. \"On the flip side, Bob and I's pay is determined by accounting from Disney. I don't get to see everything unless I ask for an audit.\" Disney claims that Miramax has only been profitable two out of the past five years, which Miramax denies. </p> <p>The Fahrenheit 9/11 brouhaha (Miramax claimed that Disney refused to allow it to release the film), along with the ensuing success of Michael Moore's film, were pawns in Miramax's ongoing struggle with Disney. Both sides have, of course, been as busy as spiders spinning the story, with Miramax touting unnamed investors who are on the verge of buying their company for them, while Disney, with an eye to the stockholders' suit, maintains that it is ready to entertain legitimate offers. But it has always seemed unlikely that Eisner would sell the Miramax name and library - the company's two biggest assets - back to the hated Weinstein brothers. And for their part, life outside the Disney umbrella seems like a grim prospect. Moreover, raising the kind of equity that would keep them in the lifestyle to which they've become accustomed seems equally questionable. Besides, most of the reports of a Miramax buyout have come from the Weinstein's assets in the New York press. That is, it seems likely that Miramax has planted them to pressure Disney into backing off. </p> <p>The latest rumour - Bob Weinstein stays at Disney with Miramax, while Harvey becomes an independent producer, releasing through his brother - sounds more plausible. After all, Bob, with his eye on the bottom line, seems more in line with the Disney mentality, while Harvey is very much of a loose cannon. If Harvey can raise enough private equity to set himself up like Joe Roth at Revolution, he might indeed be able to partner with the studios in Dumbo-sized movies. </p> <p>But we're talking a lot of money here, as much as $500-$700m a year. True, there seems to be an endless supply of billionaires just dying to blow their cash in the film business, so it's conceivable that Harvey can bag his pigeons. Plus, he's on a roll, what with Fahrenheit 9/11 and Zhang Yimou's Hero, which has succeeded in spite of him. (He overpaid for it and then shelved it for two years.) But it won't be easy. </p> <p>Besides, many studio bosses have seriously mixed feelings about the Miramax co-chairman, and may be reluctant to get in bed with him. MGM, run by old Weinstein friend McGurk, seemed like a likely partner, but that studio has fallen to Sony. Moreover, Harvey won't be putting out 40 pictures a year any more, and with a severely downsized slate of releases - expensive ones at that - he'll be taking a studio-sized risk on every one. In other words, Harvey did manage to embarrass Eisner with Fahrenheit 9/11, but he may yet pay a high price, which may be the reason he now seems to be weighing his options once again. With Eisner announcing his exit from his CEO post in 2006, and under pressure from his enemies to leave sooner, why not hang in and wait him out - although it's far from clear that his successor, whoever it is, will regard Harvey any more favourably. Meanwhile, Miramax has been shedding dead skin like a snake, ostensibly with the object of convincing Disney that it is a for real profitable business. But this may be a case of too little, too late. </p> <p>For beleaguered New York Mets baseball fans, the best-case scenario has him quitting the film business while he's ahead (he's already got his Oscar and more money than he can spend in a slew of lifetimes), and buying out the team's clueless owners, as he has said he'd love to do. It probably wouldn't take him more than a year or two for him to get them into the World Series, facing George Steinbrenner's Yankees - winners of the title four times in the past 10 years. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Peter Biskind is the author of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls.

  "<p>A wounded Tiger Woods, playing with a whimper and a grimace, nevertheless summoned sufficient of a roar to get round the Mount Juliet course yesterday in 68 to lie, with eight others, tied for eighth in the American Express World Golf Championship. </p> <p>Despite occasional applications of embrocation administered by his caddie Steve Williams, Woods was sometimes forced to his knees by the pain between his shoulder blades but he managed to play through it and, if able to continue this morning, he is still in a position to win the tournament. </p> <p>The world No2 is only two behind the leader, the Open champion Todd Hamilton, who has a six-strong phalanx behind him consisting of Sergio Garc\u00eda, Luke Donald, Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez, Stuart Appleby, Adam Scott and Steve Flesch, all five under on 67. </p> <p>It was superb scoring on a day not designed for such. The cold breeze limited the length the players could fly the ball through the air and, on the ground, placing the ball was allowed because the course was so wet, making it play longer yet. </p> <p>It was not a day for a partially fit player, either, and Woods would have been much better off playing in the warmth of his home state of Florida, hurricanes, tornadoes and floods permitting. </p> <p>After his round the American said: \"I'm just trying to get to tomorrow. I don't know if today will make it feel worse tomorrow but hopefully each and every day I'll feel better. </p> <p>\"I had a hard time making a turn either way. I was hoping it might loosen up a little bit, hoping the spasms would go away, but that didn't happen. Every time the shoulder blade goes back and contracts I get an unbelievable shooting pain right at impact and just beyond it. I just had to get through it and post a number.\" </p> <p>Woods said that he had gone to the range not knowing whether he would play, but found that he could still carry the ball about 200 yards and \"figured I'd be all right\". </p> <p>He added: \"I thought I could probably play and kind of roll it down the fairway somehow. I reckoned that if I could get the ball on the green I've been putting great, and I did again most of the day.\" </p> <p>He took some antiinflammatory tablets before playing and Williams used an athletic rub \"five or six times\". </p> <p>Woods said: \"Stevie said he couldn't believe the knots in between the shoulders. He said it felt like I'd got a sleeve of golf balls in there.\" </p> <p>Nick Faldo once said that the secret of Woods's great length off the tee was \"seriously fast shoulders\". </p> <p>The former world No1 makes a huge turn away from the ball and that creates enormously fast clubhead speed, giving him his distance. Lately, though, he has lost control of where the ball is going and even at yesterday's necessarily reduced speed he hit only seven of 14 fairways. </p> <p>That is worse than his poor season-long average of 57.6%, but he managed to equal his greens-in-regulation average of 66.5% by hitting 13 of 18 greens. </p> <p>Perhaps the 9th hole typified his day. He missed a fairway, driving into a bunker; he hit the green, albeit 35 feet short of the pin - and he holed the putt. It took him to four under for the outward half and, if he had had any thoughts about retiring after nine, they probably disappeared with the ball into the hole. </p> <p>The 10th, though, showed how handicapped he was. At 569 yards, it requires a big drive if, against the wind as it was yesterday, it is to be reached in two. Woods might normally have gone for it; yesterday, after gingerly practising a swing that went barely half way back, he clearly had no hope and had to settle for a par five. </p> <p>Luke Donald, one of three European Ryder Cup players at five under - there is only one American, Steve Flesch, and he was not picked for the United States team - played with Woods and, at four under after eight, was ahead of him by one. </p> <p>But the Englishman, from the same fairway bunker from which Woods made a birdie, missed the green and failed to get up and down. That seemed to slow him down and, though 67 is better than respectable, it was not the round it was threatening to be. </p> <p>Hamilton, the leader, admitted that he had got lucky at the 16th. \"On any other course,\" he said, \"I'd have been playing my third from the tee. I hit my tee shot over where the hospitality tents are, hit a cart path, bounced back into the rough, got a great lie and a great angle and hit a sand wedge to 15 feet; made it for a birdie.\" </p> <p>As for his take on Woods, Hamilton said: \"Tiger can hit the ball all over the place, like he's been doing lately, and still shoot four under par. The guy never gives up and that's why he's the champion he is. </p> <p>\"As for his shoulder, I heard he hurt it on his private plane. I guess you shouldn't fly privately.\"</p>"
