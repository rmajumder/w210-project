  "Four years on, the US presidential election is again a dead heat betweense a radical conservative and a mainstream liberal. And once more, Ralph Nader's oddball candidacy threatens to tip the delicate balance to the right. <p>This time the consumer activist is a much reduced force. The overwhelming majority of his closest aides and supporters have defected, including Michael Moore. The film-maker went down on his knees on cable television to beg Mr Nader to withdraw. Even his former running mate, Winona LaDuke, has come out for John Kerry. </p> <p>Four years ago, Mr Nader was the Green party candidate, backed by its modest but enthusiastic machine. </p> <p>This time, he is on his own. All he has is patchy backing, in some states, of the Reform party, a conservative, libertarian group a long, long way from his progressive roots. </p> <p>Mr Nader took 2.7% in 2000. In recent weeks, his rating has been closer to 1%. But that support is up to 4%, in some of the swing states. In any case, 1% can easily be the difference between victory and defeat for President George Bush and Senator Kerry. </p> <p>In 2000 Mr Nader took almost 100,000 votes in Florida. Al Gore lost (after supreme court intervention) by 537 votes. That is why the Democratic party, abetted by many former \"Nader's Raiders\", shock troops of the civic activism Mr Nader pioneered, have spent six months desperately trying to keep him off the ballot papers. </p> <p>Like all civil wars, it has been nasty. \"It's beyond bitter,\" said Toby Moffett, formerly one of Mr Nader's oldest friends and now leader of the legal campaign to stop him. \"He likes to say whoever used to be in his movement and is now against him is corrupt and a sellout. We think he has totally lost his bearings.\" </p> <p>The Nader campaign has been helped by rightwingers well aware of its potential to split the progressive vote. Naderites have also resorted to dubious means to obtain signatures on state petitions to get his name on the ballot. Homeless people were paid for every signature they collected; thousands were found to have been forged in the battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, scrawled alongside names and addresses copied out of a phone directory. </p> <p>Anti-Nader forces, meanwhile, have fought a legal war of attrition, bringing one case after another with the intention of driving him out of the race. </p> <p>They have not succeeded. The 70-year-old is an independent in every sense. Political isolation only deepens his martyr's sense of righteousness. \"I always thought that running for elective office is the consummate expression of the right to free speech, assembly, and petition under our first amendment. It shouldn't be that difficult in a democracy to get on the ballot,\" he told University of Minnesota students. </p> <p>He has fought his way on to the ballot in nearly 40 states. But legal objections to the dodgy signatures in Ohio and Pennsylvania have kept him out of two of the tightest and biggest battlegrounds, and the legal struggle has drained his resources. The anti-Nader campaign, combined with Senator Kerry's powerful performance in the debates and outspoken opposition to the Iraq war, have helped erode Mr Nader's backing in the polls from 5% in the spring to the current 1% rump. </p> <p>Anna Greenberg, a pollster with Democratic party ties, said the Nader vote was now very different from four years ago. Its profile now more closely resembles the voters who backed Ross Perot, a maverick conservative Texan who ran in 1992 and 1996. </p> <p>\"In 2000 you had younger collegeeducated males who were progressive and interested in environmentalist issues,\" she said. \"This time it's more like the Perot vote in the 90s: economically populist, anti-corporate, blue collar. They are much more conservative than Nader 2000.\" </p> <p>According to recent Gallup figures, when Nader supporters were asked who they would vote for if he were not on the ballot, 52 % opted for Mr Bush. Ms Greenberg disagrees. Her polling tells her Mr Nader still hurts Mr Kerry more than Mr Bush, although by a much smaller degree than a few months ago. </p> <p>In swing states where Mr Nader has slightly more backing, Iowa, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Florida, most pollsters believe he still poses a greater threat to the Democrat. The Democrats certainly think so. More than 75 former Nader's Raiders published an open letter: \"As the recipient of financial and political support from rightwing campaign donors, Ralph is party to a disingenuous effort to split the progressive vote in key states. With the major party candidates in a dead heat, Nader is poised to tip the election to Bush - again.\" </p> <p>The ex-raiders will be using phones and chatrooms to convince likeminded Americans to switch their votes. </p> <p>Yet Mr Nader soldiers on, yesterday kicking off a tour of a dozen states with a trip to Florida. His sheer determination is a testament to his single-mindedness. He has never married, and has few interests other than political reform. </p> <p>It was bred in the bone. His father, Nathra, a Lebanese immigrant, ran a restaurant in Winsted, Connecticut, where his forthright political views were served up along with the food. </p> <p>Around the dinner table, the young Ralph was called on to explain and defend his beliefs. \"I spent countless nights around that table eating wonderful Arabic food, and talking to his father and mother,\" Mr Moffett, a fellow Lebanese-American recalls. \"They were very principled people, very idealistic people, but they were also out there. They were not interested in marginal victories, only the absolute will do.\" </p> <p>The young Ralph hated working in a small Connecticut law firm. Restless, he spent his summers hitchhiking across the country talking to truckers and travelling salesmen. What struck him was how dangerous their work was. Their vehicles were death-traps. Getting a job as a congressional aide in the early 1960s, he researched the car industry and in 1965, produced Unsafe at Any Speed, an indictment of modern cars, particularly the Chevrolet Corsair. </p> <p>For years it was Ralph Nader against General Motors, who went so far as to hire private detectives to discredit him. They sent a prostitute to try to seduce him at a food counter at Safeway's but he turned her away. So the gumshoes tried to prove he was homosexual but were caught as they tried to follow him into Congress. The scandal made Mr Nader into a hero overnight. The car makers were forced to introduce seat belts, and ultimately air bags. </p> <p>In the 1970s, Mr Nader toured the country again, this time urging students to set up public interest research groups for consumer and environmental reform. Ken Ward was a Massachusetts student in 1976. \"He was talking to people afterwards, and there was a professor talking about this method of turning cow manure into methane, and using it for energy,\" Mr Ward said. \"And we got into a car and drove out in the middle of nowhere to go look at cow manure, at 1.30 in the morning. Most college speakers and politicians don't do that.\" Mr Ward became a follower and has spent his career as a consumer activist. Like so many other Raiders, he has joined the stop-Ralph effort. </p> <p>\"In his own mind, he thinks the risk of four more years of George W Bush is worth it to him. But how does that work, if by every single indicator it's done nothing?\" </p> <p>Some critics put his perseverance down to sheer ego. But an egoist would be unnerved by the rising chorus of denigration. Mr Nader's certainty is so strong that defeat only reinforces it. </p> <p>\"We lose to win, eventually,\" he told the New York Times. \"That's the story of social justice. You have to be willing to lose and fight, and lose and fight, and lose and fight. Until the agenda is won.\" </p> <p>However, former supporters see only a stubborn old man running on pride. </p> <p>\"It's the whole St Ralph syndrome. He's pure, and we're all corrupt. </p> <p>\"He's just out there somewhere where it can't be reached,\" Mr Moffett said. \"He's afraid something might be won in a marginal way. He's only for overwhelming victory.\" </p> <p><br><b> Born </b><br> February 27 1934, in Winsted, Connecticut, to Lebanese immigrants, Nathra and Rose Nader </p> <p><b> Education</b> <br>Graduated from Princeton in 1955 and Harvard law school in 1958.

  "Historically, the French have always talked up the healthy qualities of wine, believing the drink to be no more harmful than a soft beverage. <p>But now the country is reassessing its attitude, as legislation being debated this week demands that bottle labels warn pregnant women of the dangers of drinking. If the measure receives final government approval later this year, all brands of alcohol will be forced to carry a health warning advising pregnant women of the risks of foetal alcohol syndrome and recommending total abstinence. </p> <p>Doctors in France have had a much more relaxed approach towards wine consumption during pregnancy than obstetricians elsewhere in Europe, but the move to legislate reflects growing consciousness of potential risks. </p> <p>About 7,000 babies born in France each year are thought to be mentally or physically damaged by passive consumption of alcohol in the womb. Three mothers of children with congenital deformities this year began legal proceedings against the state for lack of information on the dangers of drinking while pregnant. </p> <p>Philippe Douste-Blazy, the health minister, said foetal alcohol syndrome was \"aside from genetic factors, the prime cause of mental retardation in children\". </p> <p>Anne-Marie Payet, the deputy from La R\u00e9union island, who proposed the measure, said that even moderate drinking could be dangerous. </p> <p>Coincidentally, the wine industry is experiencing its worst crisis for over a century. Wine lobbyists are not keen to have health warnings on their products and say it is the health service's responsibility to alert women to possible dangers.Winemakers in France have pointed out that health warning labels, like those on bottles in the US market, are not required under European law. </p> <p>The government has been accused of having a confused approach towards the wine industry, as it veers between a commitment to promote public health and the need to support the troubled wine growers. Last week it triggered fury from health and anti drink-driving campaigners when restrictions on wine advertising were relaxed. </p> <p>The opposition Socialist deputy, Jean-Marie Le Guen, said the government's policies were incoherent. \"One day, the parliamentary majority is dismantling the Evin law [on wine ads], the next day the government says it wants to establish a consumer warning on all wine bottles,\" he said. </p> <p>Although the French are Europe's biggest wine drinkers, with individuals drinking about 48.5 litres (85 pints) of wine a year, wine consumption has almost halved over the past decade, partly due to health campaigns. </p>",
  "<p>The boss of the Gucci fashion label was fired abruptly yesterday - just one day after a US fashion magazine claimed he was preparing to resign. </p> <p>The departure of Giacomo Santucci, chief executive of the Gucci brand, was announced in a curt two line statement: \"Employment of Giacomo Santucci, president and CEO of Gucci Division, has been terminated.\" </p> <p>The Italian fashion business - now part of the French PPR empire - gave no reasons for Mr San tucci's departure. But Gucci's group chief executive Robert Polet sent an email to staff demanding loyalty and dedication. </p> <p>The message said that sacking Mr Santucci had been \"a difficult decision to take but a necessary one\". It added: \"I cannot expect anything but total loyalty, commitment and dedication from the CEOs and top managers at all the fantastic brands that are part of the Gucci group\". </p> <p>That appeared to be a direct reference to a report in Tuesday's Women's Wear Daily, the US fashion industry bible, which suggested that tensions between the two men had reached \"boiling point\" and that Mr Santucci was ready to quit. </p> <p>It said talks to renew Mr Santucci's contract had broken down and that he had objected to PPR's \"massified\" growth strategy - fast exploitation of the big brands, including those seen on the catwalk (above). Mr Polet's memo denied he was pursuing any such approach. It said \"Gucci's commitment to creativity, quality and great craftsmanship remains unchanged\". </p> <p>He was hired in the summer to oversee the entire Gucci Group - which includes labels like Yves St Laurent, Balenciaga, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen - and is conducting a strategic review. He has now assumed direct control of the Gucci label which accounts for more than 60% of the group. </p> <p>Earlier this year Mr Santucci, who joined the business from rival Prada in 2001, was viewed as a successor to Domenico de Sole, the former group chief executive who, together with designer Tom Ford, rebuilt the Gucci brand through the 1990s.</p>",
  "<b>The present</b> <p> For me, though, the big question is why even those governments which have recognised that Britain cannot escape its European destiny - including, as I have said, the present one - always seem over time to retreat from their initial resolve. Think of John Major's \"Heart of Europe\" speech back in 1991, or Tony Blair's frequent promises to end once and for all the ambivalence and ambiguities that haunt our dealings with other European nations. Why is it that the French can be comfortable with being French and European while we still see a choice between the two? For as long as we define Britishness in opposition to Europeanism, we are doomed.</p> <p>I don't doubt the good intentions of the prime minister. He is more comfortable in his European skin than any of his predecessors since Edward Heath. He also has a huge majority in the House of Commons. So why have good intentions once again given way to political expediency? </p> <p>Iraq provides part of the explanation. But even before Mr Blair chose to stand alongside George W Bush there was ample evidence of the familiar backsliding.</p> <p>One reason - and here I am more sympathetic to pro-European politicians - is that there has rarely been a bipartisan consensus in Britain. In most other member states, the Union is woven into the political fabric. But if we look back on 30 years of Britain's membership there has been only one brief period - for two or three years after the referendum in 1975 - when both of the two largest parties have broadly agreed on Europe. </p> <p>By 1983 the Labour party, which had advocated a Yes vote in 1975, was calling for complete withdrawal from the Community. And by the time Neil Kinnock - with a little help from Jacques Delors - had persuaded his party that Europe was not a capitalist ramp, Margaret Thatcher had set the Conservatives on to their present trajectory. Mr Major's good intentions did not survive the Maastricht Treaty. </p> <p>Earlier this month I listened in despair as Michael Howard gave a speech at the Conservative party conference as hostile to the European Union as any I have heard. </p> <p>The great irony is that the Conservatives' journey along the road of Euroscepticism has coincided with a profound shift in the nature of the European Union. The Monnet vision has dimmed. </p> <p>Looking back we can see that the Maastricht Treaty represented the high water mark of federalist ambition. There has been nothing since comparable to the Single European Act negotiated by Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>Enlargement to a Union of 25 has changed irreversibly the political geography of the Union. The Franco-German alliance is no longer sufficient to drive greater integration. And for all the faux alarmism of its opponents, the constitutional treaty codifies and entrenches the balance between the acquis communitaire and the intergovernmentalism promoted by Britain.</p> <p>Yet for as long as the European Union remains a political battleground at Westminster, the Europhobic press and that part of our political establishment and public opinion still trapped in the past has a powerful lever against pro-European governments such as that of Mr Blair. Mr Murdoch's influence on the present government - and it is painfully large - depends on the absence of bipartisan consensus.</p> <p>This though provides only part of the explanation of our reluctant Europeanism. Pro-Europeans need to admit a bigger failure, one that they will have to confront head on if the referendum on the constitutional treaty is to be won. The failure is to describe and explain Europe as it is - to admit that membership of this particular club does involve a diminution of what has been classically understood as national sovereignty and to persuade people that Britain is more prosperous and secure as a consequence. To borrow a phrase, the price is worth paying. </p> <p>From the very beginning those who march under a European flag have been less than honest about the nature of the bargain struck with our European neighbours and of the implications for national sovereignty. Thus the 1971 White Paper on entry declared:</p> <p>\"There is no question of any erosion of essential national sovereignty; what is proposed is a sharing and enlargement of individual national sovereignties in the general interest.\"</p> <p>A Sophist, or for that matter a Jesuit, could defend that particular linguistic construction. But to my mind it dodges a central reality. It represents the failure of nerve which lies at the very core of Britain's reluctant Europeanism. </p> <p> Sovereignty is the truly neuralgic word in this debate. </p> <p>It carries the implication - never properly challenged by pro-Europeans - that Britain does have a clear choice: it can opt for complete freedom of action outside the European Union or surrender its independence to Brussels. Sovereignty, in this mindset, is indivisible. Once passed to Brussels, it is lost to Britain. The debate about our relationship is thus held on ground chosen by Eurosceptics - the Union, they say, is a zero sum game; the only question is whether Britain emerges a winner or loser from the all-night bargaining sessions in Brussels. And more often than not, the sceptics will always claim, it is a loser.</p> <p>Never mind that this argument has long defied the realities of the modern world; that for a medium-sized nation on the edge of Europe, the option of independent action is a mirage. As Michael Heseltine once put it:</p> <p>\"A man alone in the desert is sovereign. He is also powerless.\" </p> <p>The same is true of governments. To consider almost any of the prime responsibilities of government - to provide security and freedom for the citizen, an economic framework in which people can prosper and a safety net for the disadvantaged - is to understand the interdependence that comes with globalisation. </p> <p>Think of the direct impact on Britain of the war in the Balkans, of war and famine in Somalia, of the backing for terrorism of the Taliban in Afghanistan. I keep hearing politicians of all parties insist that Britain will never cede immigration controls to Europe. But we all know, in a nation that has 90 million visitors every year, that control is illusory. It is no accident that the present government finally began to get a grip on the flow of asylum seekers into Britain only when France agreed to close the Sangatte camp outside Calais.</p> <p>To be fair, I have heard Mr Blair make this point about sovereignty - sometimes eloquently so. Thus in 2001 he told the European Research Institute in Birmingham:</p> <p>\"I see sovereignty not merely as the ability of a single country to say No, but as the power to maximise our national strength and capacity in business, trade, foreign policy, defence and the fight against crime. Sovereignty has to be deployed for national advantage. When we isolated ourselves in the past, we squandered our sovereignty - leaving us sole masters of a shrinking sphere of influence.\"</p> <p>My quarrel with the government lies in the distance between such analysis and day-to-day practice. Ministers all too often behave otherwise. Consider the monthly meetings of the Ecofin council of finance ministers. Before each such gathering the Treasury plants in the national press some story or other about how the chancellor is travelling to Brussels to tell his colleagues what's what, to veto this or that new directive, or to explain why Britain's economic policy is infinitely superior to that of other European governments. </p> <p>The temptation is to dismiss such behaviour as just silly - the Treasury at its puerile worst. But, month by month, it returns the argument about the EU to the Eurosceptics' chosen ground, feeding the delusion that Brussels is a plot against our national interest.</p> <p>So too does the language of \"red lines\" used by the government in the negotiations on the constitutional treaty. It is self-evident that every EU government set in advance its own demands and limits in the negotiations. France, for example, has long rejected the European superstate of the sceptics' nightmares. Yet Britain alone feels obliged to frame such bargaining in terms of lines beyond which it will never retreat instead of ground on which it would like to advance. Most of the European press described the outcome of the negotiations on the treaty as a triumph for the British vision of a Europe of nation states. But the government's own choice of language had already determined that the outcome would be seen at home as at best a limited defeat.</p> <p>This perception of Europe as a battleground seeps into the media. The other day the BBC announced a review of its European coverage. It intends to focus particularly on whether it gives due airtime to the Eurosceptics. I have no objection to such an analysis. But measuring how many minutes John Redwood gets to refute Kenneth Clarke seems to me to miss the point. </p> <p>The problem with the BBC's coverage - and, to be fair, that of much of the rest of the media - is that it too reports Europe in terms of them and us, of winning and losing. Rarely does the reporting acknowledge the deeper truth - that we cannot alone control our destiny and that, as Europeans, we can all benefit from shared decision-making.</p> <p>It seems to me that unless and until Britain's pro-Europeans take the sovereignty issue head on - until they explain that Britain cannot shape its own destiny alone and that the sovereignty so beloved of the Sun is a dangerous delusion - it will never be able to properly make the case for European engagement. That means too admitting that the EU is far from perfect - that sometimes the compromises are painful. The point is that, overall, the balance sheet is unequivocally positive. </p> <p><b>The future we cannot avoid </b></p> <p>The future, as Hugo said, is unavoidable.</p> <p>In a week or so the 25 members of the European Union are to put their signature to a new treaty of Rome. This time Britain will be there. But hardly with enthusiasm. When we look around the world everything tells us that we need more Europe rather than less if Britain's national interests are to be advanced. It has always struck me as ironic that the global economic liberalism that Conservatives have espoused since the 1980s has greatly strengthened the case for the political cooperation they abhor. </p> <p>No one can imagine after the events of 11 September 2001 that we are masters of our own security in the face of the threat from al-Qaida terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; few can believe that we can control immigration and asylum flows without the cooperation of our European partners; nor tackle cross-border crime without more coordination between police and judicial authorities across the continent. </p> <p>Climate change reminds us that the environment has no respect for national borders. We need the European Union to promote further liberalisation of world trade to the mutual advantage of poor and rich nations. Alone, Britain would never be heard in the Doha round of trade negotiations; the Union is listened to attentively. </p> <p> As Peter Mandelson has recently said, the emergence of China and India as great economic powers demands more rather than less coherence in Europe if the continent's interests are to be protected.</p> <p>Consider too the competition for energy as demand increases for the world's fossil fuel supplies. Those resources are concentrated in the Gulf, Russia and West Africa and our relationship with those regions will be critical for our future energy security. Britain - or for that matter any other single European country - cannot manage those relationships alone.</p> <p>Interdependence has long been a fact of life. It will become more rather than less so in the coming decades.</p> <p>The painful paradox facing Mr Blair is that he started out in 10 Downing Street determined to rebuild Britain's relations with Europe and has ended up as a prime minister more committed to a special relationship with Washington than any but Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>A vital lesson of the Iraq war should be that we need Europe in order to have a balanced relationship with Washington - an alliance, as Mr Blair has said, based on partnership rather than subservience. I do not doubt that Mr Bush has genuinely appreciated Mr Blair's support. And I have heard senior American officials say that we British have tended to underestimate the influence the prime minister has exercised in the White House. But we should not delude ourselves that the American approach to the relationship with the UK is anything but ruthlessly utilitarianism. US foreign policy has never left room for sentimentalism. </p> <p>And looking at Mr Bush's handling of the most pressing security issues of our times - the rising insurgency in Iraq, the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Iran's nuclear ambitions among them - I would be surprised if Mr Blair would claim much of the credit for present US policy. </p> <p>I do not count myself among those who believe that we in Britain have to make an existential choice between the US and Europe - that to be full participating members of the European Union demands that we make enemies of our friends in Washington. </p> <p>Rather, I agree with the prime minister that Britain's economic and security interests lie in an Atlanticist European Union. And looking around the European Union of 25 we can see plenty of others who share that basic ambition - Germany and Italy as well as the former communist states of central and eastern Europe. I also share some of Mr Blair's doubts about Jacques Chirac's multi-polar world. Is French obsequiousness in Beijing so obviously preferable to British deference in Washington? The transatlantic community of values is sometimes exaggerated, but I fail to see how a Europe detached from America could feel more secure. </p> <p>For all that, our reflexes need to be as European as they are American - Britain cannot continue to define its ambitions in Europe in terms of what is acceptable in Washington. </p> <p>Gerhard Schr&amp;oumlder is right when he says the traffic on Mr Blair's bridge is too often one way. The government takes America's views to the capitals of Europe. It should more often take Europe's views to Washington.</p> <p>Another paradox. The future of Britain's place in Europe is now enmeshed in the outcome of the US presidential election on November 2. The conventional wisdom is that a victory for George Bush would be politically the most comfortable for Mr Blair. In fact, the prime minister needs John Kerry to win. A Democratic White House would give Mr Blair an opportunity to rebalance Britain's twin relationships with Europe and the US. The transatlantic alliance cannot now be resurrected in its postwar form. The collapse of communism dissolved the glue long provided by the Soviet threat. Europe is no longer at the centre of America's geopolitical interests; and the American guarantee is no longer the sine qua non of European security. But a Kerry presidency would provide the opportunity for, if not the certainty of, a new relationship between the US and Europe. Britain's strategic interests still lie firmly in the re-establishment of a cohesive alliance, in the rebuilding at both ends of Mr Blair's bridge across the Atlantic.</p> <p>That in turn also requires that the government wins the referendum on the proposed constitutional treaty.</p> <p>So can the British people be convinced? Here, I am at once pessimistic and optimistic.</p> <p>Pessimistic because, like everyone else, I read the opinion polls. </p> <p>And because, for all the fanfare of the prime minister's statement to the House of Commons last April, I see no evidence that the government is mobilising the Yes vote. The word from Downing Street is that nothing serious is to be said about the referendum until after the general election - Mr Murdoch's malevolent influence again. Mr Blair promises then to work his persuasive magic. He might have learned by now that the magic has faded. Even, as I suspect it will be, if the referendum is delayed until mid-2006, the campaign to win it must start now. Instead, the government leaves its pro-European case to speeches delivered by Dennis MacShane on the occasional wet night in Dudley. </p> <p>Yet I am optimistic because in spite of the message of the opinion polls, I suspect that the British electorate has more common sense on this issue than we give it credit for. Look beyond the saloon bar xenophobia of UKIP and most people do not find it that difficult to reconcile their Britishness with the idea that we are part of a larger construct. England's national football team is managed by a Swede, its most successful premiership club by a Frenchman. Where are the demonstrations on the streets against German ownership of Rolls Royce or a Spanish takeover of one of our biggest banks? </p> <p>If the referendum is framed, as it must be, in terms of a choice between continued active involvement in the EU and isolation on the margins of an organisation that nonetheless shapes our future, most voters may well conclude, as they did in 1975, that their heads should rule their hearts. The message that the Yes camp must convey - and it has the virtue of being the honest one - is that the status quo option in the referendum is to ratify the treaty. </p> <p> The British do not want to be isolated. </p> <p>Only the other day William Hague recalled that during the 2001 election campaign he had invited the voters to follow him in saving Britain from the European dragon. In Mr Hague's own candid admission: \"No one came\". </p> <p>That says to me that British pragmatism is alive and well; that, for all that some would like to think that our island status gives us a unique freedom of action, we know that the reality is otherwise.</p> <p>Lord Palmerston famously remarked that Britain did not have allies, only interests. The facts of the modern world are such that interests can only be pursued through alliances.</p> <p>As Hugo so eloquently reminded us, we may be unable to forget the past, but nor can we avoid the future.</p> <p>Thank you.</p>",
  "<b>Reputations</b> <br> <p><b>My plan to save Sainsbury's</b><br> Why is Sainsbury's like the Conservative party? Because its ideas have prevailed, but it has been left behind. Tesco is like New Labour: not really very new, just slicker, more ruthless and more modern. And now Sainsbury's is up the creek without a big idea. </p> <p>But it doesn't have to be. The big idea is everywhere you look: in the bestseller lists (Not On The Label); the TV schedules (You Are What You Eat); the papers (food-awareness columns springing up even in right-wing titles); and the aisles themselves, as anxious punters stop and study the side of the Coco Pops box. After living in a consumerist stupor for a few decades we have finally woken up. Thousands who didn't know what partially hydrogenated vegetable fats were a year ago are now busy avoiding them. </p> <p>Sainsbury's latest boss, Justin King, has promised price cuts, which is like the captain of the Titanic promising icebergs. As the orange posters outside the stores say: \"Hello.\" Price-cutting will sink Sainsbury's. The gap in the market is not below them, scrapping with Asda, but above. People are becoming choosy, farmers' markets are flourishing, even McDonald's is showing signs of scruples. The next great supermarket will be the one that renounces junk. </p> <p>Just imagine the liberation. Instead of all that depressing choice, Sainsbury's would stock only items that were honest, wholesome, reasonably healthy and fairly traded. The guiding principle would be: we check the ingredients, so you don't have to. </p> <p>Where there are Wotsits, let them stock seeds. Where there is Sunny D, smoothies. Where there is chicken injected with pork protein to make it absorb water, let them offer chicken that is actually pure poultry. </p> <p>Sainsbury's already has leanings in this direction, with plenty of organic veg and tips on healthy eating. But it needs to have the courage of our convictions. It has to dump overfished cod, chlorinated salad, fat-padded bread and the awesome cocktail of chemicals that is Caterpillar Celebration Cake. </p> <p>The food giants would hate this, but it would give Sainsbury's back its flavour and its raison d'etre. In Islington, London, where a biggish branch has this week welcomed almost as many reporters as customers, there would be a stampede. </p> <p>The change won't come overnight - it takes longer than that to restock a shelf. But Sainsbury's could launch a few new-look shops to test the water. All it needs is an adjective. It already has Sainsbury's Local and Sainsbury's Central. Sainsbury's Wholesome sounds dull. Sainsbury's Healthy would be bold, but open to attack. The winner is ... Sainsbury's Edited.

Not for Nanowrimo participants (or \"wrimos\") the indulgence of sprawling in a chair, in a study, in a house, paid for by \"the inheritance\", waiting for the muse to pay a visit, if it can be bothered. Instead, the \"no plot, no problem\" manifesto of Californian journalist and Nanowrimo's founder Chris Baty favours action, emphasising the importance of quantity, not quality. No editing, no scrutinising, no uncertainties. Just lightning at your fingertips and getting the job done. Last year, 26,000 scribes took part. </p> <p>The greatest achievement of this kamikaze approach, says Cigdem Fromm, a wrimo from Istanbul, is that it \"dispels the belief that writing a novel is unattainable\". </p> <p>This is a punk literary movement, wrestling the art of writing back from those who would have literature - \"real literature\" - as the exclusive domain of the elite. It also produces an abundance of good, or at least interesting, ideas. (Some have even landed book deals: Jon F Merz's 2001 winner The Destructor was published by Pinnacle Books in March 2003, while 2002 participant Lani Diane Rich's Time Off For Good Behavior will be published by Warner Books this month.) Curt Hauta from Saskatoon, Canada, previously worked on his evocatively titled Descend You Lazy Saviour and this year plans to write about a man who believes that he is dead and rotting, driven crazy by a foul odour. Could this be the next Perfume? </p> <p>But who cares? Nanowrimo's not about creating masterpieces. With its nonchalance towards actual \"results\", it is characterised by a recklessness that could be beneficial to artists, freeing them to push their boundaries. As Arthur C Clarke said, \"The only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible.\" So, what next?

Here's a handy household tip your granny wouldn't have come up with - Google the fridge. </p> <p>Going into cyberspace when you've run out of time to stimulate the imaginative chef inside has become, it seems, the coolest thing in the kitchen since fridges were invented. The latest use for the world's most popular search engine is disarmingly simple. All you do is enter the contents of your fridge into a search engine and - in theory - Google will hand you a gourmet meal on a plate. </p> <p>Of course, there is nothing new about using the internet to track down a recipe - cyberspace is stuffed with them. But this is different. Usually you decide in advance what dish you are going to serve up, check the ingredients, download the instructions, and set off for the shops. Instead, you are giving Google a random list of foodstuffs and asking it to come up with something. No shopping. What you have, you eat. </p> <p>Last week on a particularly bleak night I idly Googled salmon, cabbage, bacon, leeks and cumin - and there it was, fourth one down; a salmon and cabbage triumph obligingly delivered to my laptop by a company called The Recipe Place. I even had the whipping cream. Half an hour later and the fridge was empty, there were bite marks on the plates and my wife wanted to know where this sudden facility for good food had come from. </p> <p>The practice of fridge-Googling is already simmering nicely - one US-based internet site refines the idea by inviting surfers to search for vegan, Atkins or diabetic platefuls when they enter their fridge contents on their special \"Cookin with Google\" page. The idea is credited to one Judy Hourihan, a US foodie who thinks nothing of blogging her dinner parties on a personal web page complete with recipes, tasting notes and pictures of the guests. </p> <p>The most entertaining results derive from unexpected combinations, though these often come up with word lists instead of recipes - I failed to make anything with parsnips, plums and chocolate sauce. Perhaps, Dave Gorman-style, we should award ourselves a GoogleSnack when we get one first time. </p> <p>And what does it say about the contents of your fridge?

  "I would like to say thank you to Lucy for inviting me to give this lecture, and to Alan, Peter and the Guardian for organising the event. I am deeply grateful to be part of this tribute to Hugo's life work. <p>I cannot think of a greater honour than to be asked to give the inaugural lecture in what I am sure will be an enduring series. If I am honest, it is a daunting task. I'm nervous - scared, really. That is partly because I cannot recall addressing such a distinguished audience, many of whom certainly know more than I about the subject of this lecture. But it is mainly because I feel that I am standing for an evening in Hugo's shoes - and that, for any journalist, is a humbling experience. </p> <p>The trade in which I make my living is not one these days which can claim a high reputation. Political journalism in particular is too often shoddy and partisan. Polemic has become an excuse for intellectual laziness, assertion a substitute for fact and analysis. </p> <p>More than any other, Hugo stood out against this trend to remind us that journalism can indeed be honourable. He was a great writer and a brilliant historian. We all knew him for his integrity, for his determination to see and comment on the world of politics in a style devoid of prejudice and rich in understanding. </p> <p>He could be - and often was - biting about the conduct of our political masters. But this was passion rooted in knowledge and understanding, and criticism at once trenchant and illuminating. Truly honest journalism, unrivalled insight and beautiful prose - it does not come any better. The Guardian is a great paper - and I say that not to flatter my hosts this evening - but we miss Hugo's brilliance on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p> <p>Re-reading some of Hugo's columns over the summer (and if anyone here has not read it, they must buy the collection published as Supping with the Devils) I was reminded again of two other things. First of his range. He wrote brilliantly not only on the great power struggles and ideological clashes of high politics here and on the world stage, but on public policy, on the law and justice, on individual freedoms and the nature of the state, on the Catholic Church and, believe it or not, on baseball.</p> <p>Hugo also pulled off a trick the rest of us can only envy - he was an insider-outsider columnist: An insider confided in by those in power because he drew the respect of politicians of all persuasions; an outsider because he kept his emotional distance from them, and thus his freedom to paint the world as he saw it. In his own words:</p> <p> \"The columnist should try for scoops of fact, but may more readily discover scoops of interpretation. That's what I mean about the primacy of reporting. I sometimes take a strong line about a controversial subject. The reporting comes through a distinctive prism. But I think that what I'm mostly doing, more often and more usefully than sounding off, is to convey some more or less important truths about present moods and future probabilities as seen by the actors in the political game. For the most part I have been less interested in influencing events and the ministers who make them than in enlightening readers.\"</p> <p>Hugo was being characteristically modest, but his approach explains why his coverage of politicians who might have seemed distant from his own instincts was as illuminating as that of those with whom you might have assumed he had a more natural sympathy. </p> <p>Thus, more than any other contemporary writer he understood at the time the significance of Margaret Thatcher. Though unsympathetic to her politics, he recognised her resolve and saw more clearly than many of her admirers how she was changing the rules of the game. While criticising many of her policies, he wrote admiringly of her force of character and moral fibre: \"No other leader in our time, I guess, will be so easily willing to resist the desire to please.\"</p> <p>Respect for truth and diligent reporting, though, was not a substitute for passion. To read Hugo's pieces on civil liberties and the role of the state is to understand how knowledge is the friend rather than the enemy of strong opinion. As he wrote:</p> <p>\"If the separation of journalism from politics doesn't mean journalists constantly challenging the extension of arbitrary authority what's the point of not being a politician?\" Europe, and Britain's place in it, became Hugo's other great passion. When he started writing This Blessed Plot, he was, in his own description, a \"Euro-agnostic\". By the time he completed the book he had come to see it as the defining issue of British politics. Thus he declared:</p> <p>\"Europe turns out to be the one great question that draws me towards a systematic and committed allegiance.\" His research and his conversations with the actors in the great drama of our postwar relationship with the rest of Europe led him to conclude that: </p> <p>\"In no other part of our national life have politicians failed to confront the realities of the modern world as in Britain's relationship with Europe.\"</p> <p><b>Britain and Europe:</b></p> <p>So I have taken the title of this lecture from the opening lines of his brilliant history of that relationship. This Blessed Plot begins with a sentence that says it all: </p> <p>\"This is the story of 50 years in which Britain struggled to reconcile the past she could not forget with the future she could not avoid.\"</p> <p>Those words were written in the spring of 1998. Despite the early promise of Tony Blair's European policy, little has changed since. For France and Germany, the institutions of Europe represent a uniquely successful attempt to exorcise the past. For its part, Britain lives in the shadow of its history.</p> <p>The struggle to reconcile national identity with strategic interests is as acute as it has ever been. For all that Mr Blair's government has done something in recent years to make Britain's case in Europe, it has failed to make Europe's case in Britain. </p> <p>- We stand aloof from the euro - and, as time passes, there is little to distinguish Gordon Brown's policy of \"prepare and decide\" from John Major's \"wait and see\". </p> <p>- Every opinion poll says that, on current trends, the promised referendum on the constitutional treaty is likely to be lost, with all that would imply for our future engagement in the European Union. </p> <p>- The transatlantic alliance has been badly fractured by the Iraq war and, as a consequence, Britain has lost its chosen role as a pivotal power between the US and Europe. </p> <p>From the outset of his premiership, Mr Blair embraced the foreign policy formulated by Harold Macmillan in the wake of the humiliation of Suez. The leitmotif of Macmillan's strategy was that Britain had to combine a special relationship with Washington with active engagement with the major powers in Europe. De Gaulle initially thwarted that ambition. But, until the Iraq war, Mr Blair took to heart Macmillan's admonition that Britain must above all else avoid choosing between the US and Europe. Iraq forced him to make that choice.</p> <p>So Hugo's narrative - of the imperial delusions of the early postwar years, of the pinched nationalism that later defined our reluctant engagement with the European Union and of the tensions between an instinctive Atlanticism and a necessary Europeanism - remains a story without an ending. </p> <p>Much of what I have to say is drawn from his writing - for which, in that favourite phrase of today's politicians, I make no apology. Hugo wrote in terms far more eloquent than mine most of what I have always thought about Europe.</p> <p> <b>The past we cannot forget</b></p> <p>There are lots of reasons why, as in a recent description of Chris Patten, Britain has never actually \"joined Europe\". History, geography and culture all play their part in British exceptionalism. </p> <p>The xenophobia we see now in the tabloid, and in some of the broadsheet, press has roots deeper than the nationalities of some of our newspaper proprietors. Most of us were brought up on a 19th century version of British - or more properly English - history which was calculated from the outset to define us as different. </p> <p>The thousand years of history so beloved of Margaret Thatcher and the Eurosceptics are central to a myth created by the Victorians as an explanation of the historical inevitability of the British empire. This version of the past casts England as a nation always cut off from the European continent; sees parliamentarianism and democracy as a uniquely English invention; and deliberately ignores the central role of our continental neighbours - as well, incidentally, of Scotland and Wales - in shaping the present.</p> <p>Never mind that, as the historian Norman Davies has written in The Isles, that for part of this mythical millennium we were ruled by the French; that until the Reformation England's identity was drawn directly from the continent; that French remained the language of professional life until the beginning of the 17th century; or that other European states also had their diets, assemblies and parliaments. The Victorians preferred not to let facts interfere with their chosen narrative.</p> <p>Today's Eurosceptics likewise. As a novice political editor I attended the celebrations in Paris for the bicentenary of the French Revolution. Margaret Thatcher marked this grand occasion by giving an interview to Le Monde. It was a year after she had delivered the Bruges Speech. Britain, she graciously told her French hosts, had not needed a bloody revolution to appreciate the virtues of democracy. British parliamentarianism long predated 1789. So French history held no lessons for the English. </p> <p>I seem to recall that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand extracted revenge. At the glittering Elysee Palace event to mark the occasion, Mrs Thatcher had to kick her heels outside the banqueting hall as the President of the Republic first greeted a succession of rather lesser known political leaders from France's former colonies. I was also reminded the other day of the prime minister's bicentennial gift for the president. Mrs Thatcher took to Paris a copy of Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. I doubt if she intended, or M Mitterrand saw, the joke.</p> <p>The history of the past 50 years weighs just as heavily on the present. Coming to terms with what is now known as the European Union demanded that Britain also come to terms with the retreat from past glory. Political leaders have shunned the challenge.</p> <p>From that defensive mindset all else has followed: the initial belief that Britain could stand aside from Franco-German rapprochement; a fatal hesitation in understanding that we could not avoid the consequences of decisions taken on the continent; and, when we eventually joined, an approach which has displayed at once our acute insecurity and our self-conscious sense of superiority. </p> <p>After 1945 Britain saw itself as a victor and, alongside the US and the Soviet Union, a world power - and acted accordingly.</p> <p>Dean Acheson is often quoted for his famous remark about Britain's search for a post-imperial role. But another perceptive US secretary of state anticipated the agonies even before the fall of Berlin in 1945. A year earlier, Edward Stettinius wrote to President Roosevelt. When seeking to understand the British, the president might consider, Stettinius said:</p> <p>\"The emotional difficulty which anyone, particularly an Englishman, has in adjusting himself to a secondary role after always having accepted a leading role as a national right.\"</p> <p>Plus \u00e7a change</p> <p>France and Germany saw the creation of the Iron and Steel Community as vital, in Jean Monnet's words, to \"exorcise the past\". Britain was determined to cling on to its history. Rab Butler's dismissal of the 1955 Messina conference as mere \"archaeological excavations\" was matched by Hugh Gaitskell's equal scorn for the idea that Britain's fate might rest with anyone but its own leaders.</p> <p>The US, of course, was pressing the case for European unity as a bulwark against communism. But the Europe Winston Churchill wanted to unite began at Calais. As he told the cabinet in 1951: </p> <p>\"I should resist any American pressure to treat Britain on an equal footing as the European states, none of whom have the advantages of the channel and who were consequently conquered.\"</p> <p>Conquered. It's a word that still reverberates through a media which sees Europe in terms of victors and vanquished. Pick up Rupert Murdoch's Sun or Lord Rothemere's Daily Mail: \"We won the war\" is the perennial sub-text of most of what is written about our relationship with France or Germany, Italy or Spain.</p> <p>Our political culture does not help. Anyone who has spent time watching our politicians brawling across the House of Commons despatch box will know what I mean. At Westminster, politics is combat - preferably mortal. There are winners and losers; compromise represents dishonourable defeat. Ministers take the same instincts to Brussels. Our European partners are comfortable with the politics of give-and-take. Watch Gordon Brown in the House of Commons - and then try to imagine the chancellor striking bargains in Brussels. </p> <p> Alongside superiority lies insecurity. The psychology is that of the victim - the nation is ever under attack from Brussels. As Harold Wilson once put it, there will be no \"Euroloaf\" or \"Eurobeer\" on the English side of the channel. Every prime minister since has made similar pledges to defend the supposed emblems of Englishness from the foreign hordes. To be fair, there have been occasional moments of candour in this story of reluctant engagement. For all that, in later life, Margaret Thatcher would declare that the British had joined a common market and been tricked into a nascent European superstate, that was not the case she made in a speech to the House of Common during the 1975 referendum campaign. </p> <p>\"The paramount case for being 'in' is the political case for peace and security....The Community opens windows on the world for us that since the war have been closing.\"</p> <p>She changed her mind. Many years later - during that earlier great struggle between Downing Street neighbours - I had the temerity to suggest to Mrs Thatcher that one day she would relent and allow the chancellor to take the pound into the European exchange rate mechanism. She grabbed me, literally, by the lapels: \"You don't understand. I will never let the Belgians decide the value of my pound. Never.\"</p> <p>My pound. She had forgotten that its value has long slipped the reins of Downing Street and was now in the hands of currency traders and speculators, some of them no doubt Belgian.</p> <p>The politicians are not alone to blame. Much of what might be called the Whitehall establishment was long a bastion of the Euroscepticism that came with Britain's innate sense of its own superiority.</p> <p>In 1949 Sir Henry Tizard, the chief scientific adviser at the ministry of defence, challenged the hauteur of his colleagues and political masters.</p> <p>\"We are a great nation. But if we continue to behave like a great power we shall soon cease to be a great nation.\" </p> <p>Sir Henry's, though, was a lone voice.</p> <p>It would not be in today's Foreign Office. But it is still quite hard to find in the rest of Whitehall any real sense that Europe is an opportunity rather than a threat. In France, European policy is an extension of domestic policy. In Britain, it often seems at very best a necessary interference.</p> <p>No more so than in the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence. We can understand why. For several decades after the second world war, the Treasury relied on Washington for financial support and the MOD for its defence technology. Dependency has bred myopia. </p> <p>A few years ago I listened to the late Roy Jenkins relate his experience as a fiercely pro-European chancellor of the exchequer. Back in early 1970, Jenkins recounted, he had decided to use his opening speech in a set-piece economic debate in the House of Commons to extol the virtues of the European Community. His officials were ashen-faced at the suggestion. \"What's wrong?\" inquired the then chancellor. \"Nothing, sir,\" came the reply.</p> <p>Then the admission: \"It's just that we are not sure whether there is anyone in the Treasury who could write such a speech.\"</p> <p>The senior Treasury official sitting next to me that evening as Jenkins spoke, leaned over and whispered: \"We've changed,\" he offered reassuringly. Then, once again, a caveat. \"Changed a bit.\" </p> <p>A bit. </p> <p>During the mid-1990s, when I was researching a book about the entanglement with Europe of the politics of the pound, I asked a senior Treasury official why the government hadn't collaborated more closely with its European partners during the turbulent period before sterling's ignominious ejection from the exchange rate mechanism. Why hadn't senior Treasury officials at least talked to the Bundesbank and the Banque de France as the crisis had unfolded during the weeks before Black Wednesday? His reply: </p> <p>\"We were never much good with foreigners.\"</p> <p>Looking around this room I can see many distinguished officials who defy that description. But you too are exceptions.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/hugoyoung/story/0,13920,1331788,00.html\">Part two of the lecture</a></p>",
  "A US soldier on trial for abusing Iraqi prisoners told a Baghdad court martial yesterday that he hooked up wires around a hooded detainee in a mock electrocution at the behest of military and civilian intelligence officials. <p>Staff Sergeant Ivan \"Chip\" Frederick, 28, pleaded guilty to five charges including assault, indecent acts, mistreatment of detainees, and dereliction of duty. He is expected to be sentenced today. </p> <p>Under an arrangement secured with the prosecution, Sgt Frederick will testify at the trials of other soldiers linked to the prisoner abuse scandal in return for reducing the gravity of charges against him. </p> <p>Sgt Frederick, an army reservist, is the second member of the 372nd military police to plead guilty in return for lesser charges, and the most senior of the seven unit's soldiers charged so far to stand trial. </p> <p>In his testimony yesterday, he described a prison regime where policy was set by military and civilian officials involved in the interrogation of prisoners. However, Sgt Frederick played a pivotal role in the events at Abu Ghraib. </p> <p>His experience as a prison guard in civilian life led his superiors to put him in charge of the night shift in the main prison block at Abu Ghraib, including the tier where the abuse was photographed. </p> <p>Yesterday, he told the presiding military judge, Colonel James Pohl, that he had played a role in constructing one of the most harrowing images of the abuse that surfaced last April: the photo of a hooded detainee, standing on a box, with wires emerging from his hands. </p> <p>\"I took one and wrapped it around his finger. Sgt [Javal] Davis put one on his hand, Spc [Sabrina] Harman one on his toe,\" Sgt Frederick said. </p> <p>He said military and civilian interrogators regularly asked prison guards to set conditions for detainees, and he believed that officials wanted him to scare the prisoner to help with interrogation. However, he had misgivings: \"I knew it was wrong at the time because I knew it was a form of abuse.\" </p> <p>He went on to describe his role in other episodes, including the occasion when he hit a detainee in the chest with such force that the prisoner needed medical attention, and forcing Iraqi prisoners to masturbate in front of US soldiers. </p> <p>He said his command gave him little guidance on the law governing the treatment of prisoners. \"I had no support when I brought things up to my command. They told me to do what [military intelligence] told me to do.\"</p>",
  "A 10-hour security alert at one of Britain's biggest RAF bases ended yesterday when the body of a serviceman was discovered next to a high-powered rifle. <p>Flight Sergeant Philip Herring, 40, was found dead at RAF Kinloss, Moray, yesterday afternoon. A police spokeswoman said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death. </p> <p>RAF Kinloss and surrounding roads were closed after police threw up a security cordon in the early hours of the morning after reports that an armed man had entered the base. Flights were also grounded during the alert. </p> <p>It is understood Sergeant Herring gained unauthorised access to the base at 4am after he overpowered security at the main gate. </p> <p>More than 3,000 staff who work there were told to stay at home and police warned residents in the village to stay indoors. Around 200 personnel were on the base at the time of the alert.A helicopter was scrambled from nearby RAF Lossiemouth and officers from Grampian police's armed response unit were called in to help military police search the 15 square mile base for Sergeant Herring. </p> <p>The helicopter crew spotted his body in the afternoon. </p> <p>Chief Inspector Alan Smith, of Grampian police, said: \"At 2.26pm the helicopter crew reported sighting a body on the base near one of the buildings. At 2.55pm this man was identified as Flight Sergeant Philip Herring. </p> <p>\"We are sorry to announce such a tragic end to today's incident. I would like to thank the public in the area who have been very understanding about the disruption.\" </p> <p>Ch Insp Smith refused to say how Sergeant Herring had got hold of the rifle. </p> <p>He said Sergeant Herring's wife lived locally but she was not in the area at the time of the incident. </p> <p>He confirmed that police had received reports of shots being fired in the area yesterday morning, but said their investigations had found it to be legal shooting which was unconnected with their inquiries. </p> <p>He added that a report would be sent to the procurator fiscal. Sergeant Herring, who was originally from the north-east of England, had served with the RAF for 20 years and had been stationed at Kinloss as an air traffic controller for five years. </p> <p>Group Captain Chris Birks, station commander at the base, said staff were \"greatly saddened\" by the incident and that their thoughts were with Sergeant Herring's family. </p> <p>Mr Birks said a security review would take place. \"The security precautions at Kinloss have served us well for many years but, as with any incident of this nature, we will have a full review,\" he added. </p> <p>Bob and Sandy Malin, who live next to the base, said they woke at 4am to find police outside their home. \"I woke up and poked my head out the window and saw flashing lights and the police directing traffic away,\" said Mrs Malin, who works at the base. </p> <p>\"I phoned my work and they told me not to come in today because there was an incident on the camp. The man I spoke to told me he had to have an armed guard escort him to work this morning.\" </p> <p>RAF Kinloss is home to a fleet of 21 Nimrod aircraft which played a leading role in phase one of the war in Iraq last year. </p> <p>The base is currently the focus of a defence spending review which could see the Nimrods relocated to RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. </p> <p>Defence minister Adam Ingram, who visited Inverness this week, has denied the government is considering closing the base. </p> <p>Community leaders have said the closure of RAF Kinloss, which generates \u00a31m a week for the local economy, would devastate the area.</p>",
  "<p>It might be the happiest day of their lives but for many guests it is an onerous obligation: a morning in church, an afternoon of mother-in-law jokes and an evening dodging giant aunts and pervy uncles on the dance floor. </p> <p>Now a reluctant wedding guest has decided to auction on eBay an unwanted invitation to share a friend's matrimonial bliss. </p> <p>Offering people the chance to attend the reception, featuring a sit-down meal in a four-star restaurant and an \"evening piss up\" with a free bus back to your bed-and-breakfast, the anonymous seller promises \"a good \u00a3150 worth of entertainment if you time it right\". </p> <p>Despite warning users that the bride's dad may perform karaoke, her best mate \"works in a chippy in Colchester\" and her aunt wears DKNY tracksuits and quaffs Pineapple Bacardi Breezers, the invitation has attracted a flurry of bids. </p> <p>By last night, bids had risen from \u00a3200 to \u00a310m for the invitation, which features \"pink feather trimming\" and apparently plays Ricky Martin's Livin' La Vida Loca when you open it. eBay warned that the invitation was attracting hoax bidding and advised the Scottish-based seller to take steps to avoid this by using the site's pre-approved bidder system. </p> <p>The seller said the groom was a \"mate\" he used to know well until he began dating the girl he is now going to marry. The seller fell out with the couple after insulting his friend's bride-to-be and claimed he had not spoken to them for two years until they \"stupidly\" invited him to share their special day. \"No one will know you're not me except the groom,\" he promised. </p> <p>The seller later said he had been contacted by three other people wanting to get out of attending the same wedding and could now offer five tickets to the event, the equivalent of \"\u00a3400 worth of free booze, good food\". </p> <p>The cruel joke could be an expensive one for the seller: eBay could demand that he pay the 1.75% commission the company takes from sellers on the site - even if he does not receive the money from hoax bidders. </p> <p>But if the seller is worried that interest in the invitation is out of control - or if he suffers pangs of conscience - it appears he has given himself a way out. He claimed his friend's bride-to-be was so horrible \"they might not get married, so I reserve the right to cancel the bidding\".</p>",

  "<p>If using a mobile phone to pay for parking becomes mainstream, Vienna is likely to be seen as a trailblazer. The Austrian capital has just completed its first year of allowing residents to pay for any of its 126,000 short-term parking spaces by mobile phone, under what it calls its M-Parking system. </p> <p>The scheme, now used by 48,000 of the city's 650,000 registered drivers, is one of the largest in western Europe, and is being used as something of a test case for the viability of payment by mobile phone. </p> <p>To use the service, drivers must subscribe online or by phone to have their details entered into the database running the service. Subsequently, when they choose a parking space, they send a text message indicating the number of minutes they want to park. The system returns a confirmation to their phone and, if they wish, also alerts them 10 minutes before their time is up. This allows them a top-up (up to a maximum of 90 minutes) if they want to stay longer. </p> <p>Users can either arrange for debit payments to be taken from their bank account, or create a pre-pay account, in the same manner as Transport for London's Oyster card. Parking costs 55p per half hour. </p> <p>The system, agreed after seven years of consultation by the city, has been implemented under a contract with IT services firm Siemens Business Services at a cost of \u20ac15m (\u00a310.3m) over 10 years. Siemens provides the IT infrastructure, which includes two databases. Austria's leading mobile operator, Mobilkom Austria, has an agreement with Siemens to handle the telecoms infrastructure and the payment system. </p> <p>Vienna is perhaps untypical of cities considering such technology in that it has no parking meters. Until last year, parking was managed solely by use of paper vouchers available in kiosks and shops. </p> <p>For users, mobile payments have obvious benefits: no need to have cash handy; the opportunity to receive a warning message when time is running out; and the ability to pay and top up from any location. For the city, the system simplifies revenue collection, and encourages more people to pay rather than park illegally. </p> <p>But it is not all plain sailing. Critics claim M-Parking is too expensive and unpopular. They also point out that after one year, the system is not breaking even because the 10% target of 65,000 users has not been met, despite attracting 20,000 registrations in its first week of operation. </p> <p>Dr Klaus Baringer, senator of the City of Vienna and representative of the M-Parking project, dismisses these attacks. \"We are saving \u20ac35m (\u00a324m) by not installing parking meters,\" he says. </p> <p>Baringer predicts that the break-even target of 65,000 users will be met within six months, and that within five years, 50% of drivers will be using the system. \"All Vienna drivers have mobile phones and there have been no ticket errors since launch. The only problem is some people are resistant to change,\" he says. </p> <p>The city collects about \u20ac40m (\u00a327.5m) in parking fees each year, but the average revenue from each parking space is in decline year on year. Baringer feels this is due to payment avoidance rather than people deciding to park less. Data from the first year of the M-Parking project does not reveal any significant improvement in revenue generation, though the city expects to save money in the long run, due to the reduced need for administration of the paper ticketing system. </p> <p>There is also a practical difficulty: parking attendants have no visible sign that a driver has paid for a ticket. When half of the 120,000 parking spaces are paid for through mobiles, the city's 200 attendants face having to check the status of thousands of cars each day using wireless PDAs linked to the M-Parking databases. Baringer says this will make little difference in practice as attendants can check payment status very quickly. </p> <p>Johan Karlsson, consultant and co-author of Arthur D Little's recent M-Payment report, says that Vienna has succeeded in implementing a system that is easy to use - something lacking in some mobile payment systems. </p> <p>But he says that in Europe, there are only a handful of such projects, partly because of the difficulty of setting up consortia to manage similar systems in accordance with the EU's E-money Directive. Europe's largest mobile payment system is in Croatia, where 130,000 drivers are registered. </p> <p>But European cities may need to look more carefully at these technologies because Asia appears to be taking a lead. Little's researchers asked 100 experts how popular mobile payment was likely to be in their cities, and Asian contributors were far more optimistic than their counterparts in Europe. </p> <p>\"Perhaps mobile operators need to offer some other advantages to users to increase take-up in Europe,\" says Karlsson.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> As the countdown to the US presidential election begins, Sidelines has an idea for getting all those undecided male voters along to the polls: a sex strike. After all, it's tried and tested - remember the women who went on strike to stop their menfolk from endless warmongering in Aristophanes' Lysistrata? We're cheered already by signs of (in)action from the US - California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger revealed this week that \"there was no sex for 14 days\" with his Democrat wife, and niece of JFK, Maria Shriver, after he made a pro-Bush speech at the Republican convention. Believe us, Arnie, we can hold out for a lot longer than a fortnight. Consider yourself warned, men of war. <p><b>\u00b7</b> So, the verdict on the Bridget Jones sequel: she looks a bit fatter, especially around the chops, than in the first one, but there are fewer close-ups on wobbly bits jangling around as she chases after men in the rain. She must be at least a size 12. Oh, and we haven't the slightest idea what Kate Winslet's new film, Finding Neverland, is about, but we do know she turned up to the London premiere in a size-8 dress. She might claim she's simply returned to \"normal\" after having a baby, but we're sure the newspapers that proudly boasted of her new single-digit sizing (at last, proof that constant harping can pay off!) were there with tape measures to check she had the required 18-in waist. Keep 'em handy - you'll be needing them to make sure Ren\u00e9e's managed to shed those cumbersome breasts and hips when she makes it down the red carpet for Bridget: the Return. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Another contender in the pointless measurements of the week competition: a new book, Numbers, by David Boyle and Anita Roddick, informs us that the \"average woman\" spends 40 minutes every day shopping. Presumably that includes buying lunch, paying for your bus ticket and picking up a pint of semi-skimmed on the way home from the job that doesn't actually allow for 40 minutes' swanning down the high street every day. And probably doesn't pay enough, either: this week's less pointless statistic is the news that the pay gap between men and women is wider than previously thought. According to UK pay analysts Incomes Data Services, women working full time are earning 19.5% less than men, not 18% as earlier surveys had indicated. If only we spent less time shopping, we might start earning a bit more, eh? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Reader Janet Lees emails with a suggestion to help the women of Saudi Arabia, who, you might remember from last week's column, are not to be allowed to vote or stand in next year's elections because of a lack of women to staff the polling stations (which must be women-only). \"You hear lots about international electoral persons overseeing elections in countries where the international community has an interest in the outcome,\" she says. \"So what about women of the world volunteering to 'man' women-only voting stations in Saudi Arabia?\" Excellent plan, we think, and one that presents the Saudis with an easy way around what would seem to be their purely practical difficulties in this little matter.</p>",
  "In 1957, at Windscale (now part of the Sellafield site) in Cumbria, Britain's only major nuclear incident occurred. This led the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority to establish at Risley, near Warrington, what became the Safety and Reliability Directorate, and in 1958 John Ablitt, who has died aged 85, set up the team that initially carried out the independent safety assessments of the Dounreay, Calder Hall and Chapelcross reactors. <p>The fruit of his work was an incredibly detailed safety and reliability methodology. It rapidly became an international, industry-wide standard applied in such diverse fields as transport and chem ical manufacture. </p> <p>Ablitt had joined the Harwell nuclear laboratory in 1951 as an engineering control officer on the British Experimental Pile, \"0\" (Bepo) research reactor, becoming head of the design office two years later. His work included the production of isotopes for medical use, and his team designed supplementary equipment for the Dido heavy-water research reactor. One of the biggest challenges was the design of an experimental station in Bepo (codenamed Pippa) to simulate the conditions in what was to be in 1956 the world's first fully commercial nuclear power plant at Calder Hall. </p> <p>Ablitt was born in Romford, Essex, the descendant of an 18th-century Suffolk clockmaker of the same name and the son of an engineer on the Greater India Peninsular Railway. His parents returned with him to India when he was only a few months old. He enjoyed the freedom of his early years near Bombay, but, aged 13, began boarding at the Lancaster Royal grammar school, excelling at sports, and particularly rugby. </p> <p>He then began an engineering apprenticeship but, in September 1939, with the second world war beginning, he volunteered for the Royal Artillery (RA) since he thought that there would be \"a lot more science in it\" than in the infantry. In early 1941, he was shipped out to India as a commissioned officer and posted, with 157th Field Regiment, as part of General William Slim's \"Paiforce\" into Iraq, to Basra, Baghdad, Fallujah - where a skirmish with Iraqi troops ensued - Kirkuk and Mosul. The latter two were particularly important - as they still are- in terms of oil supplies. </p> <p>Neighbouring Syria was then still controlled by troops loyal to Marshal P\u00e9tain's Vichy French collaborationist regime. Ablitt and his battery were part of a brigade group, which, at Deir-ez-Zor, fought a brisk battle against the Vichyites. Despite Ablitt and his comrades being outgunned, their demoralised opponents gave up. </p> <p>In 1942, in north Africa, Ablitt, as part of 164th Field Regiment, led his men through Italian lines to escape from encirclement at Mersa Matruh. He then went on to see action at El Alamein, the invasion of Sicily, the Normandy beaches, and Arnhem, often putting himself in great danger as a forward spotter for the guns. Following the 1945 Rhine crossings, Ablitt was mentioned in despatches after he and two of his men, finding themselves behind the German lines, continued to direct fire while fighting off the enemy. </p> <p> S oon after, word reached him that another RA unit had discovered something terrible near the German town of Bergen. It was the first concentration camp to be liberated by the western allies, Bergen-Belsen. Enraged, Ablitt was among those who made the local burgomaster and the town's residents help bury the emaciated corpses in mass graves. </p> <p>After the war, Ablitt - by now an acting Major - refreshed his engineering knowledge at Biarritz's International University, established by the US forces. He then used an ex-servicemen's grant to read mechanical engineering at Manchester University. Harwell followed. </p> <p>He was a lifelong socialist and a very popular man. He also had a wicked sense of humour. Sometimes, however, the tables were turned. At Harwell, he had designed a system - nicknamed \"Rabbit\" - for rapid tube transit of radioactive isotopes for more than a mile across the site. At his Harwell leaving dinner, a pipe was run into the dining room up to his table and a rabbit, duly inserted at one end, subsequently emerged at his feet. It ended its days as a family pet. </p> <p>In retirement, Ablitt pursued a passion for caravanning. This entailed leading large parties of caravans to his beloved Spain and also as far afield as the most northerly part of Europe, Norway's North Cape, and north Africa. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Betty, whom he married in 1943, and by a son and daughter. </p> <p>\u00b7 John Frederick Ablitt, engineer, born August 30 1919; died October 11 2004</p>",

  "Levels of violent crime recorded by police jumped 11% in the second quarter of this year, government figures showed today. <p>The figures included a 14% leap in offences of violence against the person - a total of 265,800 incidents from April to June compared with 265,800 in the same period last year.</p> <p>In all there were 303,500 violent crimes recorded in England and Wales in the three months, up from 273,100. </p> <p>It also emerged that more serious violent offences were increasing more quickly than minor ones.</p> <p>But the overall number of crimes recorded by police fell by 5% compared to the same quarter last year, including a 23% slump in domestic burglary and a 15% fall in robbery. </p> <p>According to the separate British Crime Survey (BCS) - which interviews 40,000 people about their experiences of crime but omits offences against under-18s and businesses - overall crime dropped by 7%. </p> <p>Ministers announced a new initiative to tackle gun crime in four major force areas - London, Manchester, West Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire - after provisional recorded firearms offences for the year to June showed a 3% increase overall to 10,590 incidents. </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, said: \"There is an issue about violent crime so let's take it head-on. </p> <p>\"We're going to target those areas of the country and those particular neighbourhoods where violent crime is being and has caused concern.\" </p> <p>There was a 15% drop in gun killings and a 10% fall in the use of handguns, the figures said, but use of rifles rose 15% and imitation or replica weapons by 35%. </p> <p>The BCS suggested that violent crime fell by 6% and that violence involving injury dropped by 12%. </p> <p>The Home Office said the rise in violent crime recorded by police was down to more people being willing to report their experiences, and more \"low-level thuggery\" being recorded as crimes. </p> <p>In further explanation, officials said figures from police forces and \"anecdotal evidence\" suggested violent crime was still being boosted by statistical changes to the way police record crimes - a measure introduced more than two years ago. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett defended the reliability of the British Crime Survey when compared with recorded crime statistics. </p> <p>\"Crime is down and these statistics in both measures are irrefutable because they compare like with like,\" he said. </p> <p>\"There are lies, damned lies and statistics and we're all familiar with them. People can manipulate statistics all they like but we have been very honest all along. We know recorded violence has pushed up concern for violence. We know people are genuinely worried about them, so we are targeting them. We're not running away from them, we're not washing our hands of them.\" </p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said increasing violent crime was \"a consequence of the government's failure to deal with the drink and drug problem blighting this country\".</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said: \"Today's increase in firearm offences is totally unacceptable and shows that last week's tragic shooting of Danielle Beccan is not just an isolated incident.\" </p> <p>Data showed that among the overall 14% rise in offences against the person, more serious offences were increasing more quickly than less serious ones. </p> <p>The more serious category, including homicide and serious wounding, rose by 16% to 12,000 offences. </p> <p>Other offences against the person - such as less serious wounding - rose by 14% to 122,700 incidents. </p> <p>The remainder, comprising offences such as harassment and common assault in which no one was injured, rose by 13% to 131,200. </p> <p>About half of all violent crimes did not involve injury to the victim. </p> <p>Sexual offences jumped by 18% to 14,900 incidents, which may have been partly due to increased confidence in the way police and courts handle sex crime. </p> <p>Crimes recorded by police in the period totalled 1,447,400 compared with 1,526,100 in the same period in 2003. </p> <p>Jan Berry, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, called for more armed police to counter gun crime. </p> <p>\"In the last six years we have witnessed a reduction of nearly 10% in the number of authorised firearms officers in the police service. </p> <p>\"This is unacceptable at a time when increased gun crime means we should have more, not less, fully trained firearms officers available should they be required.\" </p> <p>The president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, Chris Fox, said: \"Our analysis of the rise in police recorded violent crime has shown that much of it represents 'low-level thuggery' and alcohol-fuelled violence.\"</p>",

  "<p>Climate change, predicted by the UN to change the way most people live over the next 100 years, is the least important of the world's immediate problems, says a group of economists, including three Nobel prize winners, who were asked to prioritise how money should be spent on helping the world's poor. </p> <p>The team of six American and two other economists, brought together by controversial environmentalist Bjorn Lomborg, said it was not worth spending money on climate change because the effects were expected to be far in the future. They recommended that people became rich first and that money should be spent on HIV/Aids, water and free trade.</p> <p>But they were immediately castigated by international development and environment groups, who accused them of \"understanding nothing about the real world\".</p> <p>Mr Lomborg, a Danish statistician whose bestseller The Skeptical Environmentalist created storms of protest when published two years ago by throwing doubt on climate change science, is hailed by free marketeers round the world but is reviled by many scientists.</p> <p>Yesterday he told a meeting of European rightwing thinktanks how he had brought together what he called the \"Real Madrid\" team of \"galactica\" economists.</p> <p>\"A stellar cast came to Copenhagen to reach consensus about how to help the world's poor,\" he said. \"We chose economists because they have long, valuable experience in prioritising things, and they are unaligned and impartial. We said, if we had an extra $50bn [about \u00a328bn] how should it be spent to do the most good in the world? We looked at the world's problems and came up with 32 challenges.\"</p> <p>The economists then considered the potential costs and benefits of spending money on problems like hunger, climate change, communicable diseases, sanitation, water, money laundering and financial instability. Rejecting spending anything on education, slums, terrorism, arms proliferation, deforestation, lack of energy or corruption, they narrowed the list to 10 areas, which they then divided and ranked into a number of initiatives [see list].</p> <p>Top of their wish list by a large margin was spending money on the control of HIV/Aids. \"We found that for $27bn we could prevent 28m cases of HIV by 2010,\" said Mr Lomborg. \"It was the best investment that humanity could do. The benefits would be 40 times as high as the costs.\"</p> <p>The second best option was to spend on food and health, specifically by providing micronutrients for the diets of the 850 million chronically malnourished people mainly in sub-Saharan African countries who need iron and vitamin supplements. A $12bn programme could help them significantly, said Mr Lomborg.</p> <p>Controversially, the eight professors found that the third most cost effective way to spend the money would be to promote free trade, something most of them had made their names doing. Three of the six Americans on the panel, Robert Fogel, Douglass North and Vernon Smith, are Nobel winners and five others are odds-on to win similar honours.</p> <p>Mr Lomborg, who is head of the Danish Environmental Assessment Institute, yesterday accepted that trade liberalisation policies as promoted by the professors would hurt some people.</p> <p>\"There are always winners and losers. We found that getting rid of subsidies and trade barriers had very low costs and high benefits. We reckoned that the benefits could be as much as $2.4bn a year for rich and poor.</p> <p>\"But there is no doubt that free trade is not only good, but the winners far outweigh the losers. I would say free trade is a huge boon to making a better world.\"</p> <p>There was consensus, too, that providing mosquito nets in malarial areas would benefit millions for relatively little money. The team of economists calculated that $13bn spent would halve the cost of treating malaria and give a 500% return oninvestment.</p> <p>Right at the bottom of the economists' list of priorities for humankind came climate change, which Mr Lomborg yesterday said was a problem of the future. Initiatives like the Kyoto treaty, which is expected to be ratified next month and will force rich countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, were all but useless, he said.</p> <p>\"Let's not spend the money on problems we can not do much about. Let's start with the ones where we can do the most good at the lowest cost now. It's a bad economic proposition to spend money here. Global warming will harm people in 100 years when there will be far fewer poor people. The best thing you can do is make people rich.\"</p> <p><strong> Justice</strong></p> <p> In an ideal world, he said, all these problems should be addressed. \"But it is not ideal, so we must focus on how to do most good. This is only an economic ranking. There may be other issues like justice and equity. This is not a coup d'\u00e9tat. We're not trying to take away the politicians' rights to choose.\"</p> <p>The dream team was immediately attacked by a coalition of 18 leading British development and environment groups, meeting 100 yards away.</p> <p>\"This simplistic and rather banal ranking of these problems should not be taken too seriously,\" said Stephen Tindale, the director of Greenpeace. \"It is an example of intellectual illiteracy. All these problems are linked.\"</p> <p>\"They have come up with bizarre conclusions,\" said Andrew Simms, the policy director of the New Economics Foun-dation. \"The simple point is that unless you act to prevent runaway climate change, all the other things which they prioritise - which are generally no-brainer good things - will be wrecked by global warming.\"</p> <p>Mr Lomborg, however, was unfazed. \"The biggest problem is that we all die, yet no one is considering how to solve that. These economists are talking about how much good you can do.\"</p>",

  "The level of violent crime recorded by police increased by 11% in the second quarter of this year, according to government figures released today. <p>The data also showed that although the number of crimes involving guns had risen, fewer people had died as a result of shootings.</p> <p>One measure of crime - the incidents reported to police - revealed a 14% rise in offences of violence against the person.</p> <p>However, the government instead highlighted the 5% fall in overall crime reported to police and the findings of the British Crime Survey (BCS), which interviewed 40,000 people about their experiences of crime.</p> <p>According to the BCS findings, overall crime had dropped by 7%, with violent crime falling by 6% and violence involving injury decreasing by 12%.

  "The polls in America remain uncertain, and though Bush seems to be leading there is still a significant chance that we might wind up with a President John Kerry come January 20. But what would a President Kerry be like? One interesting aspect of the campaign is that nobody's really sure. <p>One theory - which you might call the \"George W Kerry\" theory after an <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/story/files/story2557.php?PHPSESSID=1a90f817f61c2fff32a9ffc0008b198d\">article</a> by that title in the journal Foreign Policy - is that Kerry will be more like Bush than most of his supporters suppose. </p> <p>In that article, author Moises Naim argues that the president whom Kerry will most resemble - at least in terms of foreign policy - is the one we've got now, and that, paradoxically, if re-elected President Bush will be more like Kerry than he is today: \"If re-elected, Bush will have difficulty sustaining the foreign policies of his first term, whereas a first-term Kerry presidency is bound to emulate some of Bush's more aggressive positions.\"</p> <p>There's some truth to this. Presidents are powerful, but they are also influenced by the world, and neither the world, nor America's interests in it, change as much as people think from one election cycle to another. Nixon, remember, ran as a \"peace candidate\" in 1968, but was still fighting LBJ's war in 1972. And although George W Bush invaded Iraq, Bill Clinton threatened to, and even, in 1998, signed the <a href=\"http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/libera.htm\">Iraq Liberation Act,</a> which made regime change official US policy. </p> <p>Another thing that may drive Kerry toward Bush's positions is that his approach of winning help from allies in Iraq seems to have come a cropper, with both Germany and France making clear that they won't be sending troops to Iraq even if Kerry is elected. </p> <p>That will leave Kerry with a choice of relying on George W Bush's anglosphere-heavy coalition, now strengthened by the Australian prime minister, John Howard's, recent election victory, which has left Howard (along with Tony Blair) <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,11102193%255E7583,00.html\">far more important</a> to US relations, and world events, than France and Germany anyway.</p> <p>Kerry's other choice might be to withdraw. Let's call this the \"James Earl Kerry\" theory, after a column that I wrote a while back suggesting that Kerry might wind up like <a href=\"http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4924762/#040514\">Jimmy Carter:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>I think it's fair to say that if Kerry wins, he'll win based on anti-Bush sentiment among Democrats and swing voters. But although the anybody-but-Bush vote might be good enough to get him into office, once he's elected it will evaporate: the dump-Bush voters will have gotten what they wanted, and they won't have any special reason to support any particular policy of Kerry's - or even Kerry himself ...</p> <p>So Kerry might find himself elected, but with support that rapidly fades away, leaving him subject to Washington crosswinds and a slave to his party's interest groups. That's pretty much what happened to President Jimmy Carter. He owed his election to backlash over Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon and the lingering residue of Watergate. But that turned out to be an insufficient base on which to govern. Carter's own party (especially, though not only, rivals like Ted Kennedy) cut him to ribbons. We lost ground both at home and abroad as a result.</p> </blockquote> <p>This was recently echoed by The Economist's \"Lexington\" column, which <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/World/na/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3286037\">observed:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Because the election is largely a referendum on Mr Bush, he can claim, if he wins, a clear mandate for his policies - particularly cutting taxes at home and smiting terrorists abroad. If Mr Kerry wins, the only mandate he will have will be for not being George Bush. In 1993, Mr Clinton had a difficult enough time holding his party together despite laying out a compelling vision of a new Democratic Party. The singularly unvisionary Mr Kerry will have to deal not just with the same struggles (for instance, between healthcare reformers and deficit hawks) but also with a new civil war between the party's rabid Michael Moore faction and its more sensible Tony Blair wing.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's probably right. (If Bush wins, there will be a struggle within the Republican party, between its libertarian small-government and traditionalist social-conservative wings, too, but it will be more muted and it's unlikely to involve the war, as national security is the glue that holds Bush's coalition together, in the same way that Bush-hatred is holding Kerry's together. The difference is, one is likely to survive the election, and the other isn't.)</p> <p>Of course, if Kerry can't count on support within his own party, he might reach out to Republicans who support the war. </p> <p>That produces a scenario that might be named \"Lyndon Baines Kerry,\" after Lyndon Baines Johnson, the last President to brag about his Silver Star. (Though LBJ's medal was <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/johnson.silver.star/story/storypage.html\">less credible</a> than Kerry's). </p> <p>Like Kerry, LBJ was a domestically oriented politician with foreign affairs problems. Also like Kerry, LBJ seemed anxious to demonstrate his manliness in a variety of settings - with LBJ it was cowboy hats, sexual braggadocio, loud cursing, and constant flaunting of his Silver Star, while with Kerry it's motorcycles, electric guitars, and, er, constant flaunting of his Silver Star.</p> <p>Would fear of seeming like a wimp lead Kerry to escalate the war on terror rather than pursuing the cut-and-run strategy that many of us expect will mark a Kerry Presidency? Good question. That might actually dispose me to feel better about the prospect of Kerry winning, though I'd prefer a president who pursued war with cold-blooded focus rather than one who pursued it for egotistical reasons. </p> <p>But in a way, the questions about Kerry say more than their answers might.</p> <p>Kerry's big problem is that all of these scenarios are plausible, because his approach has been so unfocused that nobody knows where he'll come down in the end. (His talk of a \"secret plan to end the war\" has even spurred <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4994348/#040520\">comparisons with Richard Nixon,</a> who made similar promises when he ran in 1968). </p> <p>And that uncertainty bodes poorly for his prospects of winning in general. While there may be some people who want \"anybody but Bush\", most voters want to vote for somebody - not everybody.</p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Glenn Reynolds, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, runs the <a href=\"http://www.instapundit.com/\">instapundit.com</a> US political blog.</p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Comment on this article <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives/us_elections/2004/10/george_w_kerry.html\">here</a>.</p>",

It's a small country but it was the ancestral home of 18 out of the 56 delegates who signed your Declaration of Independence. There are, however, more substantial historical connections which link me and my family to the United States. <p>My great-great-grandfather and his brother left Wales in the 1890s and settled in Cambrian County, Pennsylvania; your neighbouring state. Later, an elder brother of my grandfather enlisted in the US Navy. In December 1941, as a Lieutenant Commander, he was stationed at Pearl Harbor where he was wounded during the Japanese attack. He's buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, Oahu. Another of his brothers was lost at sea when the ship in which he was sailing was torpedoed by a U-boat in the Atlantic en route between North America and Europe. </p> <p>So somewhere in the US I have relatives, perhaps more than I have here at home, a story which will be echoed many times throughout Europe. One thing is certain: we are all grateful for the individual sacrifices made by American families in the two world wars; our families have shared in those sacrifices in defence of liberty. We therefore have a close, sometimes personal, interest in how the world's foremost democracy conducts its affairs and presents itself to the world. </p> <p>However, we are now engaged in the wrong war for the wrong reasons and we were both lied to. Our family have a direct involvement. My youngest cousin, who unlike his brother, father and grandfather joined the army instead of going to sea, is a sergeant in the Queen's Dragoon Guards, an armoured regiment, and has served in both wars in Iraq. Brave people like him and his American counterparts should not be sacrificed because of the mendacity of our leaders. I'm sure many American families feel the same. It is also clear that organisations and individuals intimately connected to the Republican party and the president are making a lot of money off the back of this conflict. It looks to an outsider as if the temple of democracy is being abandoned to the moneylenders. </p> <p>On both sides of the Atlantic, my family have been miners and mariners, they were hard-working people who suffered much privation but their sacrifices and determination made our lives easier. I'm afraid that President Bush is taking us back to those often grim times. If you and I disagree and my letter has caused offence, I apologise again and close with the words of one of your greatest presidents, Thomas Jefferson: \"Error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.\" I hope reason prevails.</p> <p><b>From Tom O'Donnell, Dorset</b><br> Please, change the world by changing the man in the White House. </p> <p><b>From Maria Celina McCall, Uruguay</b><br> I remember sitting in my junior high school classroom in November 1963, when a nun came in to call us to the chapel to pray for the president of the US who had just been shot and was fighting for his life. I remember sitting for two days watching on TV and crying like I had never cried before, just like I cried on September 11 when the twin towers collapsed. </p> <p>I have loved America ever since, and it is because of this love, that I write to you today. Because I'm saddened to what is happening to America's image abroad and the hatred I see all around me. </p> <p>I don't know if you are a father, but if you are old enough to vote, you may know by experience, that punishments don't lead you anywhere, and that dialogue is a better way to solve problems. Dialogue is what Mr Kerry is offering and that is what the world needs now. </p> <p>I would please beg you to vote for all of us that cannot, but whose lives are affected by the decisions taken by the leader of the free world. Please vote for life and freedom. </p> <p><b>From Mohsin Talukdar, Edinburgh</b><br> I am Mohsin Talukdar from Bangladesh, currently residing in great Britain. A non-practising Muslim by faith; although faith is very important to me, I feel comfortable believing in God and being a human being practising humanity. </p> <p>I remember the US Navy coming to Bangladesh to help flood victims in the mid-80s they did a splendid job. Since then, I wondered a lot about the US. I want to visit the Statue of Liberty some day (I read the translation of the script engraved at the bottom of the statue when I was in high school, it fascinated me). It even fascinates me more now but the very thing makes the Statue of Liberty a beacon to humanity is very much threatened from outside and as well as within. That worries me a lot as a believer in humanity. </p> <p>I can remember 9/11 very vividly. It seemed surreal, felt stupid, because I can't reason through, as a Muslim, how it was supposed to voice any concern that the Muslim might have. </p> <p>When US forces were fighting in Afghanistan, I felt like fighting alongside them, wished them all the best from the bottom of my heart. It might not be possible for me to understand the complete impact that 9/11 had on America. I can understand one thing for sure - that the terrorist shouldn't win in any way because of what they did and are still doing. But it seems they are succeeding, they changed your law curbing fundamental rights and it seems still more to come.They succeeded in making the US deeply divided perhaps also made US somewhat distant from the rest of the world; whereas your constitution recognises being a part of the world community. That's why I fail to understand when George Bush says that the US shouldn't worry about anything it does for security; well, if you have your friends neutralised that can't be much of a security! </p> <p>I don't know whom you'll vote for, even if it doesn't seem right to vote for a change, but please know this, from outside it seems very much that we need your vote, America needs your vote. It's not about Kerry, Bush or Democrats, Republicans; it's about how as human beings we'll choose to deal with things. </p> <p><b>From Marc Puttock, Leicester</b><br> I am writing to you because I care about America a great deal. Let me tell you why. I lived and worked in the USA for 22 years. My dearest friends are American and some of my best memories are of July 4th parties, Memorial Day picnics, and the Thanksgiving feasts partaken with the welcoming families of friends. I close my eyes and I still see the woods and lakes of Connecticut where I spent so much of my time. </p> <p>Living in America from 1978 through to 2000 and I went through the changes along with everyone else: from the Iran-hostage crisis to the Iran-Contra scandal, the attempt on Reagan's life, the OJ Simpson verdict, the Gulf war. </p> <p>All these events would be discussed around the watercooler with colleagues whether I was working in factories or in offices. Opinions were divided, discussion sometimes heated, but at no time was that essential hope dimmed and at no time did I feel a fear for the future from those with whom I spoke. </p> <p>Sadly, that has altered. I started working back in the UK in 2000. With the distance that comes from separation, I would return to the US and feel the difference in attitudes following the calamitous events of the destruction of the World Trade Centre in New York. It was not 9/11 that changed the American outlook however. I believe that it was the response to 9/11 by its leadership that has caused this bleakness to manifest itself in the American consciousness. The war on terrorism and the climate of fear generated from the Office of Homeland Security were used to subvert American awareness and enabled the Bush-led Republican government to pursue the war in Iraq without opposition from within. </p> <p>This is why I am writing to you to ask for your help in turning the tide. </p> <p>I truly believe that we all cannot afford another four years of Mr Bush being in power. </p> <p>I have never done anything like this before and I, myself, might resent the intrusion in receiving a letter like this. Forgive me, then, please. My motivation is not driven by anyone else or by a pressure group, I am simply someone who misses the America that I knew and loved. </p> <p><b>From Ilona Bossanyi, France</b><br> I'm taking the liberty of asking you, a citizen of a country built upon the principles of democracy but whose very might is in danger of disenfranchising the rest of the world, to use your right to vote, and to vote with all your heart and your mind, in your own name but also in the name of all those millions of people who will be looking to your decision in two weeks' time. </p> <p><b>From Mark Brown, London</b><br> I don't feel entirely comfortable with writing this letter: normally I would feel to offer my opinion on another country's politics to a citizen of that country would be wrong. Yet, as a British citizen I can't help but get involved in a decision that will not only affect the people of your country but many, many others around the world, none more so than my own. </p> <p>Earlier this year my father and I visited New York for a five-day break, neither of us had been before. We had a fantastic time and thought the place was truly breathtaking, yet the one thing that struck us most was the warmth and friendship shown to us everywhere we went. One night that sticks in the memory is a visit to The Boston Comedy Club in Greenwich Village. The comedian did that usual routine of asking which members of the audience weren't from New York, we ever-so-Britishly raised our hands politely and said in hushed tones we were from England. Later, drinks were sent to our table from a group in the corner, something neither of us had ever experienced nor will we forget. The kindness shown to us by everyone we encountered is probably the thing we remember most about our trip. </p> <p>The unity so prominent in the days after 9/11 is now shattered, a wealth of sympathy squandered as our governments continue to lie and justify the wholly unjust crimes we have committed. World anger is rising. </p> <p>On November 2 you will be asked to cast what may possibly be the most important vote of recent times. I am not asking you to vote for John Kerry nor am I asking you to vote for President Bush, all I ask is that you read this letter and consider that your vote affects us all, our future and our children's future. </p> <p><b>From Ed Kite, Stoke-on-Trent</b><br> The American people like to see things through. What was started should be finished. Don't change the general in mid campaign! </p> <p>But that's what we British did in 1940. The man who had miscalculated, Neville Chamberlain, got the boot. He whose leadership had led to a series of disasters was shown the door. A man who hitherto had been very unpopular, Winston Churchill, was given a chance. and the world knows that the future was changed forever. </p> <p>To me, America is in a similar situation now. </p> <p><b>From Stuart Riches, Bedfordshire</b><br> We are different, you and I. You are an American citizen and I am not. And yet we share the pretext that we are both citizens of the free world, living in a democracy with the opportunity to vote for our respective leaders. </p> <p>I am writing to you in the hope that it may encourage you to use your vote in the forthcoming presidential election. But, why would I do this? The answer is simple, because yes, although it is a very strange thing to do, it will help me clear my own conscience with respect to the war in Iraq. You see I am one of those who, when the protests were made in London, thought about it and did not take part. I was fairly sure at the time that the war was a bad idea, but I also believed that Iraq probably did have weapons of mass destruction, and although it was not an immediate threat it probably could become one at short notice. What I believe now is very different. </p> <p>I am now prepared to stand up and be counted. I hope that you will feel the same.</p>",

  "The chancellor, Gordon Brown, risks breaking his self-imposed \"golden rule\" of borrowing only for investment over the economic cycle, experts warned today. <p>Government borrowing was not shrinking, as Mr Brown forecast in his budget, the Institute for Fiscal Studies found. </p> <p>Spending is overshooting targets but, more worryingly, tax revenue is also falling short of predictions, its director Robert Chote says. </p> <p>\"The concern for him is whether that can simply be put down to what is going on in the economy or whether there is a more deep-seated underlying weakness in the public finances and that has more important longer term implications for what you have to do about taxes and spending.\" </p> <p>The chancellor had predicted the government's \"red ink\" would shrink by around half, Mr Chote told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>\"Essentially we are just seeing a re-run of history for last year and his borrowing figures are simply mounting, just as they did last year,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It doesn't look as though there is going to be any shrinkage at all. It is early days yet so there could still be a turnaround in the coming months. </p> <p>\"But a this stage it looks as though the borrowing is coming in higher than he expected.\" </p> <p>Mr Chote continued: \"By historic or international standards there is no crisis in the public finances. </p> <p>\"Government debt has been rising for a couple of years now but at a little over 33% of national income remains well below the European average, although well above the figure in some other economies. </p> <p>\"But the problem obviously for Mr Brown is that he nailed his colours to the mast shortly after coming to office by setting out this self-imposed golden rule, which means he has to cover his non-investment spending with tax revenue on average over the ups and downs of the economic cycle which effect the way the public finances behave from year to year. </p> <p>\"At the moment if the borrowing continues to go in line with last year rather than shrinking as he had hoped in the Budget then he would be on course to miss the rule over the course of this cycle which is supposed to end in 2005-6.\" </p> <p>The chancellor could credibly argue that strong performance of the economy meant that the cycle was coming to a end this rather than next year, Mr Chote said. </p> <p>However, he warned; \"If he were to do that it makes the golden rule easier to meet in the short term because you are chopping a year of deficit off, but of course, that puts it into the next cycle. </p> <p>\"So it makes it life more difficult looking forward and, of course, looking forward beyond the election.\" </p> <p>The shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, told Today the public finances \"are in a mess\". </p> <p>\"Gordon Brown talks about investing in capital projects to make things better,\" Mr Letwin said. </p> <p>\"But what he is actually doing is letting spending slip out of control and that is why his current deficit is \u00a310bn greater than he forecast it would be at this stage of the year.\"</p>",

Its first real stab is the Qosmio E10, which I am sure its detractors will dub Quasimodo on account of its bulk. It is a notebook PC with a 15in screen that features an analogue TV tuner and a host of facilities. As it uses the Microsoft Windows XP Media Center operating system, most of these facilities can be easily controlled by the PC's remote. To access the TV or DVD player, you don't have to fire up Windows at all. The screen is superb, with Toshiba claiming it is the brightest LCD on the market. It delivers a good picture from the sides and is even watchable in direct sunlight. It is a shame, though, that it isn't widescreen. There are plans to tackle this on a later model. Its size and limited battery life means the E10 probably won't do a great deal of travelling. But as a desktop replacement, the Qosmio E10 has a great deal going for it. www.toshiba.co.uk Ashley Norris </p> <p><strong>Music </strong></p> <p><strong>Robbie's card </strong></p> <p>Last year, pop star Robbie Williams came in for criticism from the music industry for saying that music piracy was \"great\".

Later this year, French manufacturer Archos will release the Gmini XS200, a tiny hard disk-based player around the same size as the iPod mini. The key difference is that the XS200 boasts a 20GB hard disk - the same as the full-sized iPod. </p> <p>Other new rivals for the iPod are the Gigabeat F Series players from Toshiba, which are due in the UK early next year.

Other companies are taking a pop at the iPod mini, with Creative's Micro, which has 5GB of storage - 1GB more than the mini - in a smaller casing. </p> <p>Finally, there's Sony. Despite press criticism for its limited compatibility with MP3 files, its NW-HD1 is a marvel of miniaturisation that boasts far superior battery life to the iPod and delivers superb performance. Worryingly for Apple, the NW-HD1 is only the first shot across its bows by a company not keen to surrender the personal audio market to anyone. </p> <p>However, Apple still has a huge advantage in its iTunes Music Store and software. \"The competition is fast closing the gap with their portable player hardware, but Apple maintains a lead because of its iTunes software, which is the hidden jewel in Apple's product line,\" argues Ian Fogg, an analyst at Jupiter Research. </p> <p>Even here, though, Apple may have difficulties, for rival download service Napster is on the verge of bringing the third version if its software to the UK. For around \u00a315 a month, subscribers will be able to transfer any track from the company's collection of 750,000 to a personal player. For anyone eager to explore new music, it is a superb deal. So what can we expect to see in January at Apple's Expo in San Francisco? The internet is rampant with rumours that the next iPod will feature a 60GB hard disk and sport a colour screen. For my money, it will also show a small, no-frills 20GB player to take on the Archos and the Sony. <br>Ashley Norris</p>",
  "Liverpool was last night poised to become the UK's first smoke-free city after its city council voted to ban lighting up in restaurants, pubs, shopping malls and other enclosed work spaces. <p>Liverpool city councillors voted 57 to seven to create a local law to outlaw smoking in such areas. </p> <p>Parliament will now be asked to pass the council's wishes into law. Offenders would face a \u00a31,000 fine if the bill became law. </p> <p>Mike Storey, the leader of Liverpool's Liberal Democrat-run council, said he was thrilled by the vote which he hopes could have a national impact. </p> <p>\"It's an historic moment not just for Liverpool but also for the rest of the country,\" he said. \"We have taken the first step to make sure that becomes a reality. </p> <p>\"I think this will make the government sit up and think about their anti-smoking legislation nationally.\" </p> <p>Mr Storey criticised the health secretary, Dr John Reid, for comments made earlier this year in support of smoking, describing the remarks as \"totally inappropriate\". </p> <p>He added: \"There are dozens of other cities throughout the country that will follow suit and join Liverpool in this ban.\" </p> <p>A thousand people a year in the city died from lung cancer, while 100 non-smokers died from passive smoke. </p> <p>Andrew Hull, the chair of the city's Smoke Free Campaign, said it was only a matter of time before it became law: \"Liverpool will potentially be the first local authority to petition parliament on this issue. There are a number of people whose lives are made miserable because they cannot use pubs and clubs as they have asthma. They are the unheard masses.\" </p> <p>He said a number of busi nesses had been supportive, including the airport, railways, Everton football club and bars and restaurants. </p> <p>But not everyone greeted the news as enthusiastically. </p> <p>Andrew Lansley, the shadow health secretary, said: \"I believe the best route to giving people and especially children a smoke-free environment is through a self-regulatory solution agreed with the industry. </p> <p>\"If that cannot be delivered then targeted legislation may be necessary, but ad hoc initiatives by local authorities is, in my view, the least helpful way of seeking to tackle this issue.\" </p> <p>Liverpool has to petition parliament by November 27 for the bill to be introduced in time for the next legislative session. </p> <p>Ireland has banned smoking in public places and Dublin has declared the move a great success. California and New York City have also imposed bans. </p> <p>Liverpool has been racing its north-west rival Manchester to impose the first British ban. </p> <p>In Manchester, the \"fag break\" is about to become a thing of the past for more than 26,000 council employees as the city aims to become smoke-free. \"The smoke-free city is an idea whose time has come: Manchester should be in the vanguard of this change,\" said a Tobacco Control Report approved by the council's executive last week. </p> <p>Rates of smoking in the two north-west cities are among the UK's highest. The anti-smoking lobby Ash said it had been estimated that exposure to other people's smoke in the workplace caused 700 premature deaths in the UK a year, three times those killed in industrial accidents. </p> <p>Research from Canada suggests employees who smoke cost their employees an average of \u00a31,500 a year through absence and lost productivity.</p>",
  "<p>Teachers and firefighters today launched a joint campaign to get every new school fitted with water sprinklers to cut the \u00a3100m annual bill headteachers face for fire damage.</p> <p>The National Union of Teachers and the Fire Brigades Union are to ask the government to make sprinkler systems, which could greatly reduce the damage caused by fires, mandatory in all new schools. </p> <p>As many as 20 schools a week are damaged or destroyed by fire - nine out of 10 started by pupils. The number of school fires rose by 55% in 2003 with related costs increasing by more than 170% over 10 years.</p> <p>The general secretary of the NUT, Steve Sinnott, said: \"The financial loss of nearly \u00a3100m a year could be cut by 90% if sprinklers were installed, the major insurer for schools tells us. That represents a substantial sum which could be better used. Lower insurance premiums could also bring further benefits to the pupils in our schools.</p> <p>\"It seems madness that a system which costs no more than 1.8% of total building costs, yet could bring such benefits, is not already a requirement. The deputy prime minister has an ideal opportunity to rectify this.\"</p> <p>Only 150 of Britain's 28,000 schools are fitted with sprinklers as there is no legal requirement to do so. The union wants a change in the law to require the installation of sprinklers in new schools and, eventually, in all schools. The union wants the government to include this in its \u00a35.1bn school building programme, which is currently underway. </p> <p>The general secretary of the FBU, Andy Gilchrist, said: \"Firefighters see first hand that school fires devastate communities and disrupt education. This is about investing in protecting the fabric of our communities and the safety of our children</p> <p>\"Sprinkler systems slow down the spread of the fire and will stop an enormous amount of damage. It will also be safer for the thousands of firefighters who tackle school fires every year. Some kids think it's fun to start fires. What they don't see are the many firefighters injured in the last 10 years dealing with the consequences.\"</p>",
  "I've been struck, as I go round knocking on doors in Burnley, by the number of people who want to talk about pensions. Particularly people who have worked hard all their life and now think it's unfair that they are being penalised, as they see it, because the fact they have saved means they don't get as much from the state as their next-door neighbour who hasn't worked at all. <p>I understand that point of view and would support any changes in the law that provide greater incentives to save, so that people feel the government is helping them prepare for retirement, rather than making them feel they are being punished simply for behaving like responsible citizens and putting a bit away for the future.</p> <p>Of course the ideal situation would be where everyone gets a good job during their working life and puts enough away to ensure a dignified retirement. But that noble aspiration is no use to a pensioner today who, for whatever reason, has limited or no savings and is no longer in a position to work. I'm thinking particularly of elderly women who were not expected to build up their own assets in the way that many of their daughters and granddaughters are now doing.</p> <p>That's why I'm also proud of the fact that the government has made huge progress in tackling pensioner poverty - the Tory legacy was 2.7 million pensioners living in poverty in 1997; that's now down to 1.8 million, mainly due to the targeted effect of Labour's pension credit. And of course the increases in the basic state pension, winter fuel payments and free TV licences have also helped, as will the \u00a3100 off council tax for pensioners.</p> <p>We're also trying to make it easier for people to save more while they are working: the state second pension helps 20 million low paid, carers and disabled people nationwide build up a decent provision. People on moderate incomes now find it easier and cheaper to save through our new \"stakeholder\" pension. And millions more receive tax relief on the pension contributions they make.</p> <p>Yet as my experience shows we still have more to do to make sure people feel that the effort they have made to save throughout their working lives is appreciated and rewarded by the government. An important step in the right direction is our decision to change the rules so that people who do have modest savings can still get pension credits. It used to be that for every pound you saved, you lost a pound in benefit. Now it's tapered so that people who have saved a bit end up with more overall than people who haven't.</p> <p>We'll have to wait until the final report of the pension commission, set up by the government to see what else we should do to encourage greater private saving. That's not due for another year. The interim report, out last week, showed us that we need to save far more during our working lives, pay more taxes and/or work for longer if we wanted to make sure that tomorrow's pensioners weren't even worse off than today's. As one of tomorrow's pensioners myself I will certainly be waiting with interest to read the final recommendations! I may be one of the youngest people standing in a Labour-held seat but that doesn't mean pensions aren't a crucial issue, both for me and the people I aspire to represent. </p> <p>Burnley hasn't yet seen the militant grannies that have surfaced in other parts of the country. But I sense that they are sympathetically viewed and wherever you live, the so called \"grey vote\" is flexing its muscles. The important message to get across is that pensions are for the long term, so we need to take a long-term look at how we get the system right and not get drawn into knee-jerk reactions, tempting though that may be in the heat of the moment.</p> <p>But as we wait for the final report of the pension commission, one thing is certainly clear and that is that pensions are rising rapidly up the political agenda. So the task in hand is now to get back out there on the doorstep and explain that, unlike the other parties that make wild, uncosted policies, Labour is committed to a pension system with the state pension at its core, giving special help to the poorest and providing incentives to save for hard-working families whatever their wealth or income. We're making progress in that direction and have already got rid of much of the worst poverty for today's pensioners that we saw under the Tory years. Now we're doing our homework to make sure we get the system right for the pensioners of tomorrow, myself included! </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Kitty Ussher is Labour's parliamentary candidate for Burnley<br> <a href=\"http://www.burnleylabour.org.uk\"> www.burnleylabour.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<b>Iraq troop decision</b> <br> The prime minister insisted no decision had yet been taken on sending British troops to relieve US allies in Iraq. Repeatedly challenged at prime minister's question time, Mr Blair said it was a military decision and would be considered on an operational, not a political, basis. If the Black Watch regiment was asked to stay it would be back home before Christmas. <p>Mr Blair warned: \"We are about to enter a period of increased activity in Iraq. This has nothing to do with the American elections. It has everything, however, to do with the Iraqi elections in January.\" </p> <p>The Tory leader, Michael Howard, said the opposition would not push for a parliamentary vote on any such deployment. But the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, said his party would oppose any deployment which did not come at the request of British commanders on the ground. </p> <p>Mr Blair said the request was being assessed \"in the normal way\". He added: \"It is a military request, for operational reasons, and it will be considered on an operational basis.\" </p> <p>The prime minister told the Commons: \"There are some 650 troops involved. I cannot say exactly where in Iraq they are going. But I can say that much of the speculation has been wholly ill-informed and they are not, for example, going to either Falluja or Baghdad.\" </p> <p><b>Scottish regiments cuts</b><br>The prime minister defended plans to cut the number of Scottish regiments at a time when they were involved in Iraq. He said changes were needed to ensure the armed forces could meet modern needs but appeared to hint that the Black Watch could yet be spared the axe. He told Liberal Democrat Sir Robert Smith the armed forces were reviewing the configuration of battalions and regiments. \"I would suggest that we await the outcome of that review because it may not be exactly as you think.\" </p> <p><b>Margaret Hassan held hostage</b><br> Mr Blair paid tribute to the kidnapped aid chief Margaret Hassan and said ministers were doing all they could to secure her release. He said the nation's thoughts were with her. \"She is immensely respected, married to an Iraqi and worked tirelessly to help the country.\" Mr Howard said his party's \"thoughts and prayers\" were with Mrs Hassan's family. </p> <p><b>Jaguar</b><br> The prime minister called for commitments from Ford about the future of Jaguar in Britain. Labour's Jim Cunningham said employees appreciated the government's intervention over the proposed closure of the Brown's Lane factory and asked: \"What progress has been made?\" Mr Blair said he had asked the company and unions to ensure proposals were subject to proper joint scrutiny. \"I also hope they will be able to give commitments about the long term future of Jaguar and indeed Ford in the country.\" </p> <p><b>Means-testing for pension credits</b><br>Means-testing is necessary to lift the poorest pensioners out of hardship, the prime minister insisted. Mr Blair told Tory Hugo Swire the pensioner credit was introduced to help the poorest pensioners, some of whom had been on \"appalling low incomes\". \"Two million pensioners have been lifted out of acute hardship as a result of the measures we have taken.\" </p> <p><b>Youth clubs and education</b><br>Mr Blair faced calls to scrap plans to force youth clubs to meet targets for educating young people. Tory Andrew Selous said: \"Young people work hard all week, often at weekends too. What they want is somewhere they can go to relax and have fun and not be forced to achieve a 'learning outcome' on a Friday or Saturday night.\" Mr Blair said investment in youth services was increasing, adding: \"The best learning outcome is whether they are actually learning the basics in schools\". </p> <p><b>Young offender institutions</b><br>Standards must be considered alongside cost in any moves to contract the running of youth offender institutions to the private sector, Mr Blair told MPs. He said: \"It's important, whatever happens, to make sure that the way that our prisons are run is obviously at its most cost effective but also that we do the best for the juveniles in these establishments.\" </p> <p><b>Apprenticeships</b><br>The prime minister told MPs that the number of apprenticeships would increase to 300,000 by the end of next year amid warnings of a serious skill shortage. He said: \"What is more, we are ensuring that the vocational pathways for 14-19 year olds are now put on parity of esteem with the academic route\". </p> <p><b>NHS dentist shortage</b><br>Tory Anthony Steen protested there were virtually no NHS dentists in south Devon. He suggested unspent funds committed to practices in his constituency be used for homeopathic dental services rather than \"awaiting the promised arrival of bus loads of Polish dentists\". Mr Blair said there were about 2,500 more dentists than in 1997 but more were needed. \"These will all be highly qualified people,\" he said. </p> <p><b>North-east referendum</b><br>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said he was confident the people of the north-east will vote \"yes\" in the referendum on whether to set up a regional assembly. Bernard Jenkin, for Tories, said the Federation of Small Businesses in the north-east has said it would rather money was spent on up-grading the A1 road than on a \"toothless talking shop\". </p> <p>Mr Prescott insisted a regional assembly would be cheaper, costing \u00a312m less than the current arrangements, with 600 fewer councillors and 10 fewer councils. \"More efficient, more effective and the people making their own decisions - that's why I'm quite convinced they'll vote Yes,\" he told MPs. </p> <p><b>Armed forces pensions bill</b><br>The government warned it would scrap its armed forces (pensions) bill, updating pensions and compensation, rather than allow Lords' changes. In what Tories described as a \"belligerent\" move, junior defence minister Ivor Caplin warned peers could not \"cherry pick\" bits of the old and proposed new compensation arrangements. </p> <p><b>US immigration service</b><br>Anger at unfair treatment of Britons at the hands of US immigration officials was expressed by MPs on both sides. They were also concerned at the lack of diplomatic redress over incidents involving shackling and deportation. They protested that the US was not honouring its obligations as an ally by entering into dialogue with British consular staff. However, Foreign Office minister Denis MacShane said protests from the British government had prompted a rule change on cases involving minor infringements of immigration law. </p> <p><b>Child health</b><br> The shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, demanded \"a more interventionist approach\" to tackling child health problems. He said during debate on the government's National Service Framework for Children, Young People and Maternity, that asthma, diabetes, alcohol and drugs misuse and poor sexual health were among \"many indicators of children's health that are not necessarily moving in the right direction\". </p> <p>Junior health minister Stephen Ladyman said the NSF involved a \"fundamental change in thinking around the needs of the child\" and had been described by experts as \"the biggest step forward for children for 50 years\". He added: \"It will raise standards in hospitals, GPs' surgeries, schools and nurseries, maternity units and Sure Start children's centres.\" </p> <p><b>Gaelic broadcasting</b><br>A Labour former Scottish minister Calum MacDonald condemned as \"indefensible\" the government's funding of Gaelic broadcasting. He said there was a unique opportunity to set up a dedicated digital television channel but the government appeared \"incapable of willing the means\" to fund such a venture. The culture minister Richard Caborn insisted the issue had been \"high on the political agenda\" and \u00a38.5m was a \"considerable sum of money\". </p> <p><b>English counties</b><br>England's historic county system \"is in the process of being destroyed\" and reforms are needed to preserve a \"vital\" piece of heritage, Tory Adrian Flook said. He told the house people viewed counties as sources of \"identity and affection\" but council changes meant traditional boundaries were being eroded. His historic counties (traffic signs and mapping) bill would see counties marked on Ordnance Survey maps and tourist signs placed on roads to alert people to original boundaries. It gained its first reading but stands no chance of becoming law. </p> <p><b>Customs and excise</b><br>Customs and Excise officers should be told to \"cease imposing their own personal ideas\" of how much drink and cigarettes for personal consumption can be brought home by travellers from abroad, Tory former chancellor Lord Lawson urged. He said: \"Tax law is very clear that anybody can bring unlimited quantities of cigarettes or booze into this country, provided it is for their own personal consumption.\" Lord McIntosh Haringey, for the government, spoke of \"many thousands of cigarettes which are claimed to be for personal use in a number of cases in which travellers have been stopped by customs and excise.\" </p> <p><b>In parliament today:</b><br>The environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, and her ministers face the Commons at question time. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, opens a debate on defence in the world. The Lords debates the committee stages of the highways (obstruction by body corporate) bill and the civil contingencies bill and Commons amendments to the companies bill. </p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>BULLETS AND BALLOT BOXES</b></p> <p>\"Just say no\", implores the Guardian. But according to the front paper's front page, the sentiment comes too late. Tony Blair has just said yes to the Pentagon's request that 600 British troops be redeployed to a US-controlled area south of Baghdad.</p> <p>\"Ministerial sources will defend the decision on the basis that the request came as much from the Iraqi interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, as the Americans,\" the paper says. \"They dismissed suggestions\" - aired in the Telegraph - \"that the decision had been made last week ... government sources also argued that Britain could not criticise heavy-handed counter-insurgency tactics by the US and not take on some of the toughest parts of Iraq\".</p> <p>Tony Blair told the Commons yesterday that the Black Watch troops would be \"home by Christmas\". But the Times dampens down that optimism by splashing with the news that an additional 1300 British troops could be called up for duty in Iraq before next January's elections. The suggestion, voiced on the Times' letters page today, that redeploying the Black Watch would enable George Bush to vaunt the strength of the US-led coalition at a very opportune moment is mocked by Gerard Baker. \"Picture the scene in some family room in Volusia County, Florida. They have just read on page B27 of the local paper an Associated Press brief with the news that plucky Geoff Hoon has ordered the British to save America's skin.\"</p> <p>Peter Riddell drives home the point on the same page: \"What anyone overseas says or does is irrelevant to the outcome of the US election.\"</p> <p>Which leads the Wrap to the furore surrounding the Guardian's initiative to encourage readers to write to voters in Clark County, Ohio in an effort to influence their vote.</p> <p>\"Terry Brown had received a letter from a Scottish Guardian reader,\" reports the Telegraph's correspondent from Ohio. \"The navy veteran and retired lorry builder was 'offended' as he read the polite note, from Nicola Smith of West Lothian, with its denunciation of the Iraq war as a 'farce', and closing plea to remove from power 'the parties responsible for this war'.</p> <p>\"Mr Brown looked out at his front garden, decorated with a US flag on a tall pole, a giant carving of an American eagle and a wooden cross marked: 'September 11, 2001'.</p> <p>\"'I feel very strongly that this was an invasion of my privacy,' he said.\"</p> <p>In an article billed on the Guardian's front page as \"Operation Clark County - the exit strategy\", the Guardian's features editor defends the project. \"We set out to get people talking and thinking about the impact of the US election on citizens of other countries, and that is what we have done.\"</p> <p>What news of the election itself? The Telegraph reports that the Sinclair Broadcast Network, which had scheduled a film accusing John Kerry of betraying fellow Vietnam veterans, has backed down.</p> <p>Teresa Heinz Kerry made what the paper describes as an \"unguarded\" remark to the effect that Laura Bush \"had never had a real job\". Ms Heinz Kerry added that \"her experience and validation come from important things, but different things\".</p> <p>An apparently fit Bill Clinton revealed last night that he will appear at a Democrat rally in Pennsylvania next week with John Kerry.

  "The Royal College of Nursing yesterday put restoration of the school nursing service and a ban on smoking in public places at the top of its list of demands at the next general election. It published a six-point manifesto to put pressure on the political parties to campaign on issues of patient care. <p>The RCN, the leading professional union for nursing, calls for a dramatic increase in the number of school nurses to give all children access to treatment and advice. \"At present there are less than 3,000 school nurses across the UK, serving almost 26,000 primary and secondary schools,\" it said. </p> <p>Thousands of lives and millions of NHS pounds would be saved by banning smoking in all enclosed public places, including workplaces, bars and restaurants, it added. </p> <p>Other demands in the RCN manifesto were legislation to ensure that all those committing acts of violence against healthcare staff are prosecuted; fully funded long-term nursing care in all parts of the UK; recruitment and retention of nurses being made a priority; and a nurse on every strategic board in the health service. </p> <p>Sylvia Denton, the RCN president, said: \"Healthcare is too important to leave to politicians because it is nurses who are the most powerful advocates for patients. It's time to harness that power ... the RCN challenges every political party seeking election to listen to nurses.\"</p>",
  "<p>Radioactive discharges from nuclear power plants may be more strictly controlled in the light of a government report which finds that the health risk from particles taken into the body may be 10 times greater than previously thought. </p> <p>The report, commissioned by the then environment minister Michael Meacher in 2001, says the existing safety guidelines do not take into account recent scientific studies which indicate a greater degree of uncertainty in judging the risk. </p> <p>Consequently the guidelines either underestimate or overestimate the danger posed by some radioactive materials by up to 10 times, the report says. </p> <p>The findings may go some way to explaining the clusters of childhood leukaemia cases near Sellafield in Cumbria and other nuclear power plants. </p> <p>\"These uncertainties go part way to bridging the gap, but it would be a big jump to say they're sufficient to close the gap,\" said Dudley Goodhead, chairman of the committee examining radiation risks of internal emitters (Cerrie), who produced the report. </p> <p>Despite the lack of hard evidence to link radioactive discharges to cancer clusters, the government might consider imposing tighter controls on nuclear plants as a precautionary measure, he added. </p> <p>\"It's really for the policy makers to recognise the uncertainties. For me, it would mean tighter restrictions on some of the radionuclides, particularly if they're in the environment in the sort of situation where [children] are most likely to be exposed,\" he said. </p> <p>The study was commissioned to re-evaluate the danger of radioactive particles that get into the body, by inhalation, ingestion or in medical procedures. These range from plutonium particles discharged by nuclear plants to substances entering the food chain from rocks and soil. </p> <p>In the body these particles can cause damage to DNA and increase the risk of cancer. </p> <p>The report says that although the risks associated with materials such as caesium are well known those relating to others, especially plutonium in children, are poorly understood. </p> <p>Turning to the risks associated with medical procedures, Prof Goodhead said at his London press conference yesterday: \"It becomes a balance between the medical benefit of the diagnosis and the risk of the procedure. </p> <p>\"Doctors have got to make judgments and part of that surely must be knowing as well as possible what the risk is.\" </p> <p>The report recommends studies to better understand some of the recently discovered effects of radiation. It has been passed to the committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment (Comare) which will advise the government directly. </p> <p>Last month Mr Meacher supported a minority report by two members of Cerrie, Richard Bramhall of the Low Level Radiation Campaign and Dr Chris Busby of Green Audit, who resigned and argued that the health effects of manmade radiation had been underestimated by a factor of at least 100. </p> <p>This week he said he feared that \"really important evidence that ought to be in the public domain ... is being suppressed.\" </p> <p>\"The traditional model [used by Cerrie] is based on the victims of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945 and measures the impact of gamma radiation on the body,\" he said. </p> <p>The control samples taken for those studies were from people who lived so close by that they too had ingested traces of residual radiation from dust and debris. </p> <p>\"The only effect measured, therefore, was the impact of radiation from the initial blasts. </p> <p>\"Those living near nuclear reactors are obviously the most vulnerable [to ingesting radioactive material]. </p> <p>\"My belief is that the traditional model may underestimate the [effects] by between 100 to 300 times, possibly more.\"</p>",
  "Government plans to give the NHS fraud squad stronger powers to root out corruption in the health service are in danger of breaching principles of patient confidentiality, doctors' leaders warned last night. <p>Ministers will today call for legislation to give the NHS Counter Fraud and Security Management Service (CFSMS) the right to demand access to clinical information held in GP surgeries, foundation hospitals and other bodies outside the control of the Department of Health. </p> <p>They think this is needed to detect crimes costing the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds. </p> <p>But the British Medical Association said disclosure of patient files might breach the Data Protection Act and damage the relationship of trust between doctor and patient. Under the proposed legislation, fraud detectors would be entitled to turn up unannounced and ask to view electronic and paper files, but would not be allowed to force their way into premises without police assistance. </p> <p>Anyone refusing to comply would be liable to prosecution, with a maximum penalty of nine months' imprisonment. </p> <p>The NHS counter-fraud team claims to have saved the health service \u00a3478m since it was set up five years ago. Successes included the confiscation of \u00a3800,000 from a GP after the detection of a six-year prescription fiddle, and jailing of a primary care trust chief executive for a mileage expenses fiddle. </p> <p>It is currently investigating 52 GPs, 28 nurses, 24 hospital doctors, 71 pharmacists, 85 dentists, 23 opticians and 22 external contractors. </p> <p>But the service has few powers to demand documents and has to call on police to use their powers of search and arrest to extract material from suspects unwilling to volunteer it. </p> <p>The consultation paper says: \"Making use of police powers is not always possible, and in any event is often a drain on police time. Additional powers to provide access rights to information would enable fraud specialists to deal themselves with the majority of their cases in a professional manner.\" </p> <p>The fraud busters have realised their authority could be whittled away by government policies to expand foundation hospitals and send more NHS patients to the private sector. </p> <p>They are able to obtain a direction from the health secretary to demand information from NHS hospitals, though not from GPs or other inde pendent contractors. However, the health secretary's writ does not run in foundation trusts or independent treatment centres. </p> <p>The proposed legislation would plug these loopholes. The consultation document said: \"We estimate the powers are likely to be used on a maximum of about 300 occasions a year for the purposes of preventing and investigating fraud and corruption.\" </p> <p>Stewart Drage, a negotiator for the BMA's general practice committee, said it was in full support of action against fraud, but was taking legal advice on a potential threat to patient confidentiality. Primary care trusts and the Audit Commission were also seeking access to clinical records for other purposes. </p> <p>\"We jealously guard patients' confidentiality. These various bodies want to gain access to material in the interests of pursuing their own agendas, but we have to be careful about any approaches that have the potential to dilute patients' trust. </p> <p>\"The information they are seeking is often inextricably linked to personal details. It is not easy to distinguish between organisational, managerial and clinical issues. When a patient consults with us, we do not write three sets of notes.\" </p> <p>Health minister Lord Warner said: \"We will not tolerate corruption and fraud in the NHS. Every penny we are investing in the NHS must be used for the purposes for which it was intended.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sir Trevor McDonald yesterday branded a Tory MP \"juvenile\" for suggesting that he had risen to become a leading newscaster because of his race. </p> <p>Jonathan Sayeed, MP for Mid Bedfordshire, has apologised for recommending that the veteran ITN newsreader be asked: \"Do you ever feel embarrassed at having benefitted from positive discrimination?\" </p> <p>The question, which was emailed to the Independent, was a reply to the paper's request for tough questions to be put to Sir Trevor during a charity interview. </p> <p>Mr Sayeed, whose father was Indian, said yesterday he had made a mistake in wording his question. He said he had meant to ask if Sir Trevor felt embarrassed about \"the allegation\" that his colour had helped him succeed. </p> <p>\"If I have caused any offence inadvertently then I will of course apologise,\" he said. \"I would point out that with a surname like mine and with my family background and with being against any form of discrimination based on skin colour for over 20 years, I am the last person to poke fun at someone who has achieved so much.\" </p> <p>Mr Sayeed's office said the MP had phoned to apologise, but had not been able to speak personally to Sir Trevor and had left a message with his assistant. </p> <p>Sir Trevor said any such suggestion was \"juvenile\" rather than offensive. </p> <p>\"It would be nice to know how I've benefited from positive discrimination,\" he said. </p> <p>Among the wittier \"killer\" questions submitted to the paper for the Trinidad-born broadcaster was: \"How come you got a knighthood before Jon Snow?\" </p> <p>Sir Trevor was one of the first ethnic minority television journalists on British screens.

  "<p>The financial services division of Capita, the company that administers the television licence and the London congestion charge, has been fined \u00a3300,000 by the City watchdog for mis-selling precipice bonds. </p> <p>Capita, which also looks after council tax charges for nine local authorities, will additionally pay \u00a33.5m in compensation to 500 investors - an average of \u00a37,000 - who lost out from advice to buy the high-risk bonds. </p> <p>Precipice bonds guarantee a high annual income - usually 10% - for three to five years. But purchasers risk losing some or all of their capital if stock markets fall. </p> <p>The fine by the Financial Services Authority is against the company's Capita Trust subsidiary, a financial adviser formerly known as Royal &amp; SunAlliance Trust Company. </p> <p>The business was previously part of life insurer Royal &amp; SunAlliance and mainly sold to redundant or retired RSA staff. It became part of Capita Group in May 2001, and one in four of the mis-selling cases occurred after that date. </p> <p>The FSA says all customer files reviewed showed the company had \"failed to take reasonable steps to ensure its customers understood the risks\" when the bonds were sold between June 1997 and September 2002. </p> <p>The firm was first put on notice following an FSA inspection in August 2001 that \"there were serious deficiencies in its advisory sales processes\". </p> <p>\"But,\" the FSA says, \"the firm failed to review past bond recommendations to check whether unsuitable advice had been given and failed to im plement changes.\" The company sold more than 50 bonds with capital losses ranging from 9% to 100%; most lost more than 50%. </p> <p>The FSA says Capita cooperated with the investigation.

  "<p>Every so often a programme comes along that makes watching television not only a duty but a pleasure. We're lucky at the moment: there are two. Green Wing continues on Channel 4 on Fridays, and now the BBC has entirely redeemed itself for any shortcomings real or imagined with <strong>The Power of Nightmares</strong> (BBC2). </p> <p>The first part of Adam Curtis's trilogy of films about global politics was many things. Primarily, it was a forensic examination of how two apparently conflicting ideologies - American neo-conservatism and Islamic fundamentalism - came to rule the modern world. Second, it was a timely blast in the face of political waffle and half-truths, that should be required viewing for anyone allowed to vote in a democracy. Third - and this was by no means the least of its achievements - it solved the age-old problem of documentary film-makers who don't have a lot of original footage to show. Curtis's deployment of archive material was so witty and pertinent that it told the story as much as the words. </p> <p>Curtis focused on two key figures in postwar political philosophy - Egyptian Sayyid Qutb and American Leo Strauss - whose ideas were so similar that you could hardly see the join. Both found Truman's America to be some kind of immoral hell on earth. Both thought personal freedom was the road to perdition. Both their philosophies led, by a maze-like route that Curtis rendered clear, to an unreasoning hatred of the USSR. And when the USSR was out of the way - can you see what comes next? </p> <p>They turned on each other. </p> <p>There's no point in regurgitating Curtis's arguments, not that I'm equal to the job, but there were some highlights worth recalling. Donald Rumsfeld featured as a key player in the Ford administration, banging on about the Red Peril as early as 1975. When the CIA said there was no evidence for weapons of mass destruction, he commissioned a report that used that very lack of evidence as proof of their existence. At the same time, Qutb's disciple Ayman Zawahiri was figuring out that mass murder of \"non-Muslims\" (ie everyone apart from his gang) was justifiable. Rumsfeld went on to we-all-know-what. Zawahiri went on to inspire Osama bin Laden. As this tale unfolded with grisly logic, Curtis bombarded us with sights and sounds that had a logic of their own. He raided archives well - there was some lovely footage of clean-cut American youth at a 50s dance, an image that, to Qutb, proved the hopeless decadence of the west. But it was when Curtis got playful that his cinematic skills really took the breath away. At the end of the film, we saw Taliban fighters dancing to that same schmaltzy 50s groove; never has a complex point about the cyclical nature of history been so deftly made. </p> <p>It's beyond the power of a review column to do more than hint at the richness of The Power of Nightmares, but worth mentioning that the series continues next week and can only get better as it moves closer to the current situation. Documentary of the year, without a shadow of a doubt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in the parallel universe that is Sun Hill nick, law-enforcement professionals were spending more time beating up, terrorising and murdering each other than they were in policing this crime-torn quarter of London. At one point Gabriel (Todd Carty) practically throttled June (Trudie Goodwin) against a brick wall - then she calmly got into the car with him to go and sort out a bag-snatching. </p> <p>Back at the station, everyone else was prowling around in a state of nervous exhaustion, sexual arousal or both. I bet they don't prepare you for that at Hendon. It was all getting so tense that when Kerry (Beth Cordingly) got murdered it came as a relief, like a thunderstorm on a sultry day. I love <strong>The Bill</strong> (ITV1) when it lurches into Grand Guignol, and it don't get much grander than this. </p> <p>It's always a relief to see Liza Minnelli alive and working, and she was actually quite funny in a cameo in <strong>Arrested Development</strong>, the hit American show that BBC2 managed to wrest from the competition. She played Lucille Austero, described by a myopic admirer as \"a brownish area with points\", which isn't a bad summation of Minnelli's basic look. Cunningly, the character had to fall over a lot; whether this was an in-joke, or just sound logistical planning, is not for us to say.</p>",
  "<p>HIT Entertainment, the company behind children's television character Bob the Builder, fired its chief executive yesterday and warned of a difficult trading environment next year. </p> <p>The news overshadowed the long-awaited announcement that HIT was to launch a 24-hour digital channel in the United States in a deal which will also see the company's characters watched in more than 100m US homes. Shares fell 11% yesterday to an 18-month low of 195p, the biggest faller in the FTSE 350. </p> <p>Rob Lawes, 37, was ousted unanimously. His sudden departure comes after a profit warning in June and problems in the difficult US market. </p> <p>Company founder and chairman, Peter Orton, who is to take over until a suitable replacement is found, praised Mr Lawes for his \"financial background and relationship with the City\", but added: \"As non-executive directors, we have an obligation to look to the future ... We need somebody who understands how to run channels and also somebody who has empathy with creative people.\" </p> <p>HIT has been criticised for its pipeline of new shows following a string of acquisitions. Two years ago it bought Gullane, which owns the rights to Thomas the Tank Engine stories, as well as Lyrick Studios, the US company behind Barney, the purple dinosaur which has more than 1.5m viewers for its US series. </p> <p>One media analyst, who declined to be named, called the timing of Mr Lawes' departure \"bizarre\". Mr Lawes was credited with pulling off the US deal after 18 months of work. \"To can the architect on the day you unveil this great new edifice is unusual and makes people nervous,\" he said. </p> <p>The US channel, to be launched next September, will be targeted at pre-schoolers in the same way that CBeebies is in Britain. HIT is to invest up to $32m (\u00a318m) over five years for its 30% stake alongside other shareholders PBS, the publicly funded US broadcaster, Comcast, America's largest cable company, and Sesame Workshop, creators of Sesame Street. </p> <p>The channel, which will show HIT programmes and is as yet unnamed, is expected to make a profit in 2008. </p> <p>HIT's pre-tax profits fell 43% to \u00a314.6m in the year to the end of July, on turnover down 12% to \u00a3148m. The company was hurt by the weak dollar: at a constant exchange rate underlying pre-tax profits would have fallen 9% to \u00a336.1m. </p> <p>It was also hurt by the decision taken by Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, to cut shelf space devoted to children's entertainment. The entire industry targeted at children has also been hurt by over-optimistic forecasts for DVD demand as young families continue to buy and watch videos. Bob the Builder has also been off the air in the US for more than a year. </p> <p>Mr Orton, 61, described yesterday's results as creditable in tough conditions, which he expected to continue well into next year. He forecast flat markets until 2006, when the benefits of the US deal were expected to show. \"The US channel deal ... heralds the transformation of the company into a vertically integrated content owner/broadcaster,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Lawes, who started as a TV production company runner when he was 17, joined HIT at its launch in 1989. </p> <p>The former finance director is on a six-month contract and so is expected to receive half his 2003 annual salary and bonus of \u00a3375,000 on his departure. </p> <p>As a sign of its confidence, the company recommended a final dividend of 0.64p, twice last year's 0.32p. Mr Orton yesterday lifted his stake in the company to 6.24% with the purchase of 50,000 shares. He called this deal \"a bargain\".</p>",
  "<p>A high court judge yesterday threw out broker Collins Stewart's record \u00a3230.5m damages claim against the Financial Times. </p> <p>Mr Justice Tugendhat said that any trial resulting from such unprecedented claims for damages - based on the value of the company's share price -would be \"unwinnable\" and a \"waste of time\". </p> <p>Collins Stewart had claimed that an FT article led to an underperformance of its share price equivalent to some \u00a3230.5m in the seven months following the August 2003 article. If successful, the broker's case would have set a precedent, allowing companies to use market capitalisation as a measure of damages. </p> <p>Mr Justice Tugendhat said: \"I have decided that the claimants cannot win on this part of their claim, and that a trial of that issue would be a waste of time.\" </p> <p>He said: \"The suggested measure of damages is far too uncertain to be acceptable as a legal basis for assessing damages.\" He also directed Collins Stewart to pay legal costs in the four-day hearing, likely to add up to tens of thousands of pounds. </p> <p>FT editor Andrew Gowers said: \"We are extremely pleased the judge's decision has vindicated the belief we have always held - that the basis for Collins Stewart's \u00a3230.5m damages claim was manifest nonsense and untenable in law. </p> <p>\"It would be a very dark day for journalism and for a free press if publishers were to be held liable for a drop in share price following publication of an article reporting on company events.\" </p> <p>Terry Smith, chief executive of Collins Stewart, immediately hit back, and in doing so sparked a new round of defamation claims. \"To paraphrase Mr Gowers himself, it would indeed be a dark day for journalism and the free press if his 'who cares if it's true or how we got it ... let's run it anyway' school of journalism were to win the approval of the courts. No sensible person would celebrate that.\" </p> <p>The FT immediately accused Mr Smith of defamation and instructed its solicitors to demand a retraction. </p> <p>Mr Smith called the idea that his claim threatened the media in general \"nonsense\". </p> <p>He said: \"Our claim is against the FT for specific inaccurate reporting, not any other newspaper.\" </p> <p>The disputed article reported allegations made by a former employee of Collins Stewart. In his suit, James Middleweek accused the company of insider trading and unfair dismissal. These accusations and a counter suit by the broker have subsequently been dropped, as has an investigation by the watchdog, the Financial Services Authority. </p> <p>A spokesman for the company said yesterday: \"No one disputes that we suffered damage as a result of the FT's publication. The only thing in question is the methodology of the calculation of those damages. Today the judge rejected our sophisticated market-based solution in favour of a more traditional approach.\" </p> <p>The only matter remaining is Collins Stewart's libel action against the FT, which will be heard in April. The company is suing for \u00a337m as a result of lost business. </p> <p>The FT reiterated its desire to \"robustly and vigorously\" defend itself against this libel claim, adding that it was not the only national newspaper to report on the Middleweek allegations. </p> <p>Collins Stewart shares closed 2.75p higher at 399.25p while Pearson, which owns the FT, lost 4.5p to 605.5p.</p>",
  "<p>The government is heading for a row with Brussels over European commission plans to beef up the powers of EU statistical authority Eurostat to monitor national data.

The deficit this year, after the Olympic Games, could be 5.4%. </p> <p>Mr Almunia said that, under existing law, the commission had no power to monitor public accounts directly. \"The rules need to be extended to ensure that Eurostat ... can carry out effective checks on the data notified by member states.\" </p> <p>The British government, which holds up the Office for National Statistics as a beacon of excellence, is fearful that Mr Almunia's proposal - which has yet to be formalised - will give Eurostat powers to intervene in the ONS's workings. \"We remain to be convinced of the advantage of Eurostat oversight,\" officials said. </p> <p>The Greek scandal, which followed a similar problem in Portugal, has prompted some EU politicians to suggest that Eurostat or some other body become a pan-European statistical agency with powers to override national organisations such as ONS. The Treasury has indicated hard line opposition. </p> <p>\"The solution to a particular problem in Greece should not be the uprooting of national statistical bodies which have proven credibility with the markets,\" a senior British official said.</p>",
  "A recent report published by those campaigners for equality the Fawcett Society showed that, for the first time since 1945, the Tories had a larger proportion of the male vote than the female. Discussing this shift on Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Eleanor Laing, Conservative MP for Epping Forest and shadow minister for women, said: \"If you were to ask a woman whether she agreed with the Tory policy on health, she'd probably say, 'I don't know what it is.' But if you were to ask, 'Do you believe in cleaner hospitals?' she'd say yes. And that is Conservative policy!\" <p>The quote says much about the party's relationship with its female constituents (it patronises them), as well as the entire notion of feminism in politics. Laing is clearly a conflicted kind of feminist - frequently wheeled out as a \"caring Conservative\" because she is a single mother, she then gets all hot and bothered and says, \"Well, I had a husband originally!\" </p> <p>In the year that she was elected prime minister, Margaret Thatcher said that \"the women of this country have never had a prime minister who knew the things they know, never, never. And the things that we know are very different from what men know.\" But was she in any sense a feminist? Thatcher's place in the history of the women's movement - indeed, in the history of women - must be gauged according to the following questions. Is it possible to further the interests of women without doing anything more than pursue your own interests, while happening to be a woman? Is it possible to court women voters, to further their interests, without being a feminist? Harriet Jones, curator of a new exhibition at the Women's Library in London, Iron Ladies: Women In Thatcher's Britain, puts it like this: \"Is feminism the same as alcoholism? Do you have to say you are one before you can be one? Or can other people decide you are?\" </p> <p>There's no question that Thatcher made the most of being female at the start of her political career, trading rather merrily on housewifely wisdoms to crank up her appeal. In an interview with the Finchley Press in 1962 (she became MP for Finchley in 1959), she shared her Christmas recipes with readers (her stuffing balls sound fabulous), leaving the interviewer to remark sagely: \"Like most mothers, she feels the sauces grown-ups like for the Christmas pudding are too rich for children; she serves single cream with the pudding for her twins, Carol and Mark.\" </p> <p>On balance, like any male politician kissing a baby or telling the Daily Mail how much he had the hots for his wife when he first met her, Thatcher was probably just trying to sound a bit human. The domestic metaphors she knitted into her speeches - references to \"the many practical skills of a wife and mother\" - were simply stylistic flourishes. The speech notes she wrote on tiny cards to ensure they fitted into her handbag signified nothing more than a person with a (possibly too small) handbag. </p> <p>It is difficult to say what Thatcher meant by \"the things women know\". If she meant some kind of feminine intuition, that's laughable. If she meant the ancient, practical things that only women know, she must have been talking about childbirth (or periods?) and, again, it's difficult to divine any effect on policy. About the only thing Thatcher did for mothers was freeze child benefit, while at the same time castigating them for leaving their children in the \"chaos of workplace creches\". </p> <p>The other thing that women know but men don't is how annoying it is to be sexually discriminated against. Thatcher felt this very keenly when she was campaigning in Finchley, and complained often, but there's little evidence that she had a broader interest in women's working conditions. The Equal Pay Act as we know it may have been passed under her tenure (in 1984), but it was an amendment of the original 1970 act. At government level, too, she was markedly uninterested in the advancement of other women. Baroness Young popped up in cabinet very briefly, as leader of the Lords, but Thatcher made only eight other female ministerial appointments during her time in government - and only one went higher than junior minister. </p> <p>And yet Thatcher did leave a legacy, perhaps not on the women's movement, but certainly - and arguably more importantly - on the practical conditions in which women live, and on our expectations. At the most basic level, the fact that a woman has occupied the most important job in the country has had an impact on the cultural landscape: in that sense alone, Thatcher expanded other women's horizons and did much to break down bigotry about women's work. </p> <p>You could also argue that, in an indirect and unintentional way, she helped broaden British notions of femininity. When the Spice Girls and their ilk lauded Thatcher for all the empowerment she rolled out, they were talking about more than the fact that she existed. They were talking about the fact that she was bellicose, uncompromising, uncaring and harsh. In the way she carried and presented herself, she might have been careful never to upset anyone's idea of what made a woman (always the fluffy hair, never the trouser suit), but in terms of personality and, chiefly, in terms of policy, she never showed any sign of \"feminine\" compunction. </p> <p>Of course, this was also used against her. When she was attacked for her social negligence and uncaring policies, she was also accused of betraying her sex, of trying to be a man in a man's world. Half the reason the chant \"Maggie Thatcher, Milk Snatcher\" stuck, after she took away free milk from poor children while secretary of state for education, was the resonance it carried about the \"unnatural woman\": she was the Lady Macbeth figure who smashes the baby's skull while breastfeeding. </p> <p>Thatcher betrayed her own assessment of what made a woman - she was a social conservative, against single mothers, working mothers, women in general. She just made an exception for herself. The lack of social conscience, the underfunding of socially beneficial institutions, the rejection of state responsibility to its poorest members, the emphasis on \"helping oneself\" in absurdly difficult circumstances: these were the cornerstones of Thatcher's governance, and of her contribution to society's image of women. But their secondary impact, in terms of gender politics, is that feminism is now often seen as part-justification, part-shorthand for the relentless pursuit of your own interests, so long as you're female. Thatcher's brand of female empowerment was really no more than an extension of her capitalistic ideals. </p> <p>Long before they elected a female leader, the Tories were considered more progressive than Labour on women's issues. This had a lot to do with the power of the unions and the fact that, taken as a whole, their support for women's employment rights was ambivalent and patchy. Naturally, there were those unions that did champion the rights of their female members and often, by extension, all women. In the 1980s, the National Union of Public Employees produced leaflets about abortion rights that were well beyond its remit. There were also powerful female unionists, and substantial auxiliary support for strikes and other union actions from wives and such. </p> <p>But the fact was, many of the monolithic industries that defined union culture were predominantly male, for reasons that were practical and traditional. Men were also determined to seize back the jobs women had very capably taken over during the war. Jobs in the mines, docks, steelworks - all were full-time and occupied by men. Women, by and large, could find a foothold in the workplace only through part-time work, and the unions were powerfully opposed to the encroachments of part-timers. This was for perfectly good reasons - even today, the employment rights offered to part-time and temporary workers are absurdly niggardly compared with those offered to permanent staff. Any change in culture to accommodate part-timers would inevitably be to an employer's advantage. </p> <p>Manifestly, though, union resistance to new practices worked against women - against their entry into the workplace and against their rights once they got there. When Thatcher succeeded Callaghan in 1979, there were 487 unions, with 13 million workers. Now there are just over 200, with 7.4 million workers. Smashing the unions was possibly Thatcher's most famous legacy - and it consumed her, this business. There were seven trade union and employment acts during her tenure, including a ban on secondary picketing and on disciplining non-striking members, and the introduction of closed ballots. As was shown by groups such as Women Against Pit Closures, there can be no serious abrogation of workers' rights, be they male or female, that will leave the other gender unaffected. It is still eminently arguable, if tricky to prove, that without the breakdown of union power, female entry into the workplace would have met with greater obstacles and taken a lot longer. It would be wholly daft, on the other hand, to contend that this is what Thatcher had in mind when she did it. </p> <p>A massive portrait of \"The Right Honourable Margaret Thatcher And her Advisors In The Falklands Conflict\", at RAF Northolt, says much about Thatcher and feminism. There she is, in a white diaphanous dress, depicted like an angel of mercy among lots of uniformed men, talking about this ludicrous attack on an island that still draws the consensus from all reasonable people that we didn't much want it and don't much know what to do with it now we have it. She had little interest in improving the public image of women, or in furthering other women's careers; she had no interest in peace, or sundry other matters that might be considered \"feminine\". If she improved the lot of women, she did it by the accident of having been born female. On a practical level, she improved women's lot not at all. But for those of us whose world did improve, who saw opportunities swing open and had the background, wealth, education and circumstance to maximise them, she did something unmatchable. Is it churlish if I carry on hating her, anyway? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Iron Ladies: Women In Thatcher's Britain, opens this week at The Women's Library, London E1. Admission free.

  "As the British government prepares to send its soldiers north to free up the US army to attack Falluja, it is necessary to focus on what this coming onslaught will mean for the city and its people. Falluja is already now being bombed daily, as it is softened up for the long-awaited siege. It has been a gruelling year for its people. First, they were occupied by the US army's 82nd Airborne, an incompetent group of louts whose idea of cultural sensitivity was kicking a door down instead of blowing it up. Within eight months of the invasion, the 82nd had killed about 100 civilians in the area and lost control of Falluja, leaving it to the US marines to try and retake the city last April. After killing about 600 civilians, the marines retreated, leaving the city in the hands of 18 armed groups, including tribesmen, Islamists, Ba'athists, former criminals and an assortment of non-Iraqi Arab fighters said to be led by the Jordanian, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. <p>Fallujans have now been offered a choice: hand over the outsiders they dislike (mostly Arabs) who are protecting them from the outsiders they really hate (the Americans), or get blown apart by the world's most lethal killing machine, the US marines. Zarqawi's influence on the resistance has been wildly exaggerated - indeed, many people in Falluja don't even believe he exists, and most find the non-Iraqi Arabs' brand of Salafi fundamentalism at odds with their local Sufi traditions. Today, many Fallujans are tired even of their own mujahideen, but trust the US army even less, and with good reason. Recently, a Bush administration official told the New York Times the bombing was driving a wedge between the citizenry and the non-Iraqi fighters. If, indeed, the civilian population is being bombed for this end, this is a grave war crime. </p> <p>We have a blueprint for what will happen in the city during the coming attack: Falluja, part one. Like all sequels the next time will be bloodier. Last April I found myself inching across a bridge into Falluja holding an old white T-shirt: in front of me, marines blocking the bridge, screaming at me to go back; behind me, a large group of Iraqis yelling at me to go forward so that they could follow me through the roadblock and rescue their families. After a while, the marines opened the bridge allowing hundreds of women and children to stream out, but stopped the boys older than 16 and men younger than 60 from leaving the city. Preventing civilians from leaving a battle is against the Geneva conventions - although battle doesn't capture what a meat grinder the city had become in that first week of the assault, when the majority of civilian casualties were killed, blown apart by precision, and often inaccurate, airstrikes. </p> <p>The dead were buried in gardens or in mass graves in the city's soccer field. For three weeks 5,000 marines surrounded the city of 340,000 - think an assault on Cardiff. The marines created a moving front line of humvees and tanks, cutting Falluja off. In the air, helicopters and fighter planes bombed a city without air defences, while unmanned drones circled continuously, looking for targets. </p> <p>During that first week, I was told by Iraqi fighters that the marines nearly took the city after capturing a lot of rebel ammunition: stockpiles of land-mines and homemade rocket launchers that plugged into car lighters. Oil barrels with distances painted on them lined the streets so the rebels could register mortars. The mujahideen were more than a few foreign fighters and Ba'athists, as the US army had been telling everybody. </p> <p>Initially, the majority of civilian casualties came from bombing that caused \"multiple blast wounds, lost limbs, abdomens blown open,\" as Falluja's doctors told me. According to the Geneva conventions, force must be proportionate and when these images appeared on Arabic television - dead families stacked on top of each other - it looked anything but proportionate; it looked like mass murder. Against the advice of the marine commanders, the White House ordered a ceasefire. The resistance regrouped, re-supplied itself and fought on. </p> <p>I made it back into Falluja during the second week of fighting by using fake Iraqi ID. I was accompanied by a translator who told people I was a brother suffering a brain aneurysm. We left Baghdad and drove down roads guarded by guerrilla fighters. The countryside from Ramadi east to Falluja and then to Baghdad was in revolt. We had to pass through resistance lines to get to the marines and then through insurgents to get into the city. It was the marines who were surrounded, not the rebels. This is why the US army needs British troops to free up their soldiers. </p> <p>The Americans have more than enough troops to attack Falluja, but as soon as they do the area will once more erupt, and it will take everything the Americans have to control the surrounding villages of Habbaniya, Khaldiya and Al Kharma. According to the Iraqi president, Ghazi al-Yawar, there is a good chance that when the marines hit Falluja again, even Mosul, home to three million Sunnis, will explode. Unlike the US army, Mr Yawar knows what he is talking about and understands the way the tribes are grouped in northern Iraq, an intricate web of families that runs through the Sunni triangle. If Mosul is pushed over the edge, holding the north will be like trying to keep the lid on a pressure cooker by hand. </p> <p>Once we got into Falluja, we were taken at gunpoint to a mosque where we were interrogated by a host of people - former Iraqi secret police and Islamists - before being saved by a friend of my translator's who told us later they were holding 18 hostages in another room. Both hostage-taking and using a mosque as a military base are - like preventing the escape of civilians - against the laws of war. You could hear the occasional shots from snipers, the circling drones, tank fire and mortars. At a clinic, the doctors rolled their eyes at the mention of the mujahideen, but most of their anger was directed at the Americans. The hospital, which lies across the Euphrates, had been cut off from the rest of the city by the marines - another questionable act under the Geneva conventions. </p> <p>Worse still, the doctors said, several of their colleagues had been shot by snipers along with ambulance drivers, both grave breaches of the laws of war. At this point, most civilians being brought in had head and upper body wounds, most likely from marine snipers. Nothing I saw during the bombing of Baghdad could have prepared me for Falluja under siege. It was as if the marines had been able to cut the city off from the idea of safety itself. </p> <p>The third time I went into Falluja was during negotiations to hand control of the city over to what became the Falluja Brigade. Mujahideen were busy attaching wires to bombs on street corners, in case the negotiations failed. Today the city is one giant improvised explosive device. But it is the snipers the people of Falluja fear more than anything else. </p> <p>I have spent time with both resistance fighters and the US army, and there is no question the marines can take the city. But the US has a developed a habit of winning engagements while losing the war - while breaking the laws of war in the process. This is what Britain's redeployment will help to unleash. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Patrick Graham is a journalist who worked in Iraq from November 2002 until August 2004 for the Observer, Harper's and the New York Times magazines.

  "It was a week ago that it was first disclosed that soldiers from the Black Watch regiment had been told to prepare to deploy to an area south of Baghdad to help out the Americans planning a fresh assault on Falluja. <p>The story, published in a Scottish newspaper, wrongfooted ministers, infuriated military chiefs and provoked a political storm which, a week later, shows no sign of abating. </p> <p>The Daily Record's disclosure followed a briefing by the army to families of the Black Watch worried that their soldiers, for the second year running, would not be home for Christmas. Moreover, they were engulfed in the row over plans to merge the historic regiment into a single, anonymous, Scottish military unit. </p> <p>Four days earlier, on October 10, Major General Bill Rollo, commander of British forces in southern Iraq, had received a telephone call from General George Casey, commander of the 130,000 US troops in Iraq, asking for help. </p> <p>It was a formal request to send a battle group to the south of Baghdad to enable the US marines there to plan for the fresh attack on Falluja. Lieutenant Colonel James Cowan, commander of the Black Watch, the British army's rapid reaction reserve in southern Iraq, was given a \"warning order\" - to get his troops ready to move to an area 20 miles south-west of Baghdad around the towns of Iskandariya, Latifiya and Mahmudiya. </p> <p>The chief of the defence staff, General Sir Michael Walker, and senior army commanders expressed what defence sources describe as \"real concern\" about the security gap the Black Watch would leave in the British-controlled area around Basra in southern Iraq. </p> <p>If violence erupted again there, other British troops, now engaged in training Iraqi forces, would have to fill the gap. That would delay the Iraqi training programme, delaying in turn the departure of British troops in Iraq. </p> <p>Furthermore, the Black Watch was approaching the end its six-month tour in Iraq. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the assumption among defence chiefs was that the Black Watch would be off to central Iraq very soon since they believed ministers - their political masters - would want to accede to the US request. </p> <p>They took a decision as read. \"From an army perspective we were keen to get on with it,\" a senior defence source said. </p> <p>All that had to be sorted out were assurances from the US that the Black Watch would be deployed for a limited period in a well-defined area under British rules of engagement. </p> <p>These were the issues discussed in Iraq on Tuesday by a British army recce team - a mission to which Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, and Tony Blair this week attached much greater significance than was warranted as they were forced repeatedly to insist that the decision to go along with the American request had not been taken and when it was, it would be entirely \"operational\" - in other words, one taken by the defence chiefs. </p> <p>The way the story broke last Thursday meant that Downing Street and the Ministry of Defence were not able to handle an announcement the way they wanted to. </p> <p>On Friday morning one of Mr Blair's spokeswomen told lobby journalists she was not aware of the US request. Later in the day it emerged from politicians at the Progressive Governance Summit in Budapest that Mr Blair had returned to London early because of events in Iraq. No further explanation was available and No 10 suggested it was simply because he had finished his bilateral meetings in the Hungarian capital. </p> <p>By the end of the day the US request was no longer being denied. At the weekend No 10 lost further control of the story as the Sundays asserted, with the help of the shadow defence secretary, Nicholas Soames, that the British move was a way of shoring up George Bush ahead of the election. </p> <p>Senior military figures were becoming increasingly irritated as the decision became engulfed in a debate ministers seemed unable to dominate. On Monday, under growing pressure, Mr Hoon cancelled a trip to Scotland to give a \"holding statement\" to MPs. With growing suspicion that a decision had in effect been taken, despite denials by ministers, Mr Hoon faced a barrage of hostile questions, finally admitting to the Liberal Democrat MP Jenny Tonge that \"we will have failed in our duty\" if Britain did not go along with the US request. </p> <p>On Tuesday, the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said the government was \"very sympathetic\" to the request. </p> <p>As the depth of the opposition on the Labour benches unnerved the high command, ministers rejected any suggestion that a final decision would be in any way political. Yesterday in the Commons, Mr Blair quoted General John McColl, Britain's senior officer in Baghdad, who earlier told the BBC that the request was \"reasonable and sensible\" from a military point of view. </p> <p>But he also referred to \"other political considerations\" which he did not specify. \"To a military mind it is not a difficult decision. But not only military minds are taking the decision,\" said one senior defence source who wanted to remain anonymous. Another insisted: \"Ultimately this was a political decision.\" </p> <p>Certainly, Mr Blair made a true politician's announcement by saying that the Black Watch would be home by Christmas. But the question of whether the US request was politically as well as militarily inspired remains unanswered. </p> <p>Meanwhile, events on the ground underscore just how sensitive a troop movement would be. The latest US aerial bombardment of Falluja killed a family of six, while two car bombs in Samarra yesterday underscored that, contrary to previous claims, the US does not have that city under control. </p> <p>If the violence jeopardises the elections, then ministers know that no exit strategy exists for British troops. Nor will the Iraqi government have a democratic mandate to hit the insurgents mercilessly.</p>",
  "Sir Thomas Gresham, financial adviser to Elizabeth I, is remembered for his \"law\" of monetary economics - bad money drives out good. According to Gresham's law, if two kinds of money have the same denomination but a different value (gold coins v banknotes, for example) the paper money will drive the gold coins out of circulation because people prefer to pay their debts with the low-value paper currency and hoard the gold coins. The solution is to reform the currency so that there is only a single standard. <p>Academic grades also appear to be subject to Gresham's law - bad grades drive out good. The process begins with grade inflation. Academic grades are intended to be an impartial, albeit imperfect, measure of how well a student understands a subject. Good grading is careful, accurate and allows universities and employers to make meaningful distinctions among students. Good grading also allows students to assess their progress. </p> <p>Grade inflation occurs when marks go up without any corresponding increase in academic achievement. Because the top grade is fixed, inflation causes grades to bunch up at the upper end. This year, more than 22% of students received an A grade at A-level. These students represent a large range of performance. Those at the top end know a lot more about their subject than students who just squeezed into an A. Unfortunately, this information is lost when all students are given the same mark. As grades continue to inflate, the amount of information they convey decreases. </p> <p>Once grade inflation begins, it becomes self-sustaining. Schools and testing agencies that wish to maintain rigorous standards find their students losing out to those given inflated grades. Not wishing to see their students suffer, they start increasing marks. In this way, bad grades drive out good ones. To halt this insidious process, we need to engage in \"currency\" reform; we need to reintroduce standards. This is where Mike Tomlinson's report comes in. </p> <p>His proposals to reform the education of pupils aged 16 to 19 include a change to the grading system. Specifically, he wants to provide finer discrimination at the top end of the performance scale by introducing A* and A** grades. University admission tutors will welcome this recommendation. By itself, however, it will not be enough. The social pressures that gave rise to grade inflation in the past are still as intense as ever. If we do nothing to prevent it, A grades will inflate to A* and A**. </p> <p>Recognising this, the Conservative party recommends a quota on the highest grades. Rationing A grades to a fixed percentage of students would eliminate the possibility of marks compressing at the top end, but it also has drawbacks. Quotas make it difficult to know what students have actually learned. </p> <p>Think of it this way: if we fix the proportion of students who can get an A in maths at 10%, then the top 10% of a poorly performing year group will get the same proportion of A grades as a population of high-performing students. Yet, the latter group may know a lot more mathematics than the former. Fixing the proportion of students who can get an A makes it difficult to tell whether student achievement is improving. To create a marking system that gives us an objective idea of how well a student has mastered a subject, we need a combination of the Tomlinson and Conservative proposals. We need an extended range of marks and a commitment to rigor, especially at the top end. We also need Tomlinson's proposed transcript of student performance, which will provide a deeper understanding of what students have actually mastered. </p> <p>Stable currencies are difficult to achieve. In our marking system, we should work at least as hard as the Bank of England to keep inflation down to manageable levels. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Steven Schwartz is vice chancellor of Brunel University; he led the government's independent inquiry into university admissions </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:steven.schwartz@brunel.ac.uk\">steven.schwartz@brunel.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>An NHS hospital in the first wave of hospitals to win foundation status yesterday admitted it was in \"acute financial difficulties\" and heading to make a \u00a34m loss by the end of the financial year. </p> <p>The independent regulator of foundation trusts issued a formal notice requiring Bradford Teaching Hospitals to remedy a \"significant\" departure from the business plan, which he approved in the spring. </p> <p>Other NHS hospitals have got into deficit and were bailed out by the government with a supplementary allocation. But foundation trusts lost this leeway when they claimed the privilege of independence from Whitehall control. </p> <p>The Bradford hospitals' financial distress is likely to prompt further criticism from Labour MPs who were anxious about Tony Blair's commitment to give every NHS hospital the opportunity to gain foundation status within four years. </p> <p>Frank Dobson, the former Labour health secretary, said last night: \"The policy is not going well. In July four of the first wave of 20 foundation trusts were demoted from three to two stars. Now another one of them is in a financial crisis. </p> <p>\"Yet these were the hospitals that were supposed to be the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me.\" </p> <p>David Jackson, the Bradford trust's chief executive, said it was on course to bring down waiting times, but faced a number of financial uncertainties. In a letter to the board of governors, he blamed the government's new system of payment by results, an inadequate inflation allowance, and the high cost of introducing the new consultants' contract. </p> <p>However, none of the other trusts that gained foundation status in April received a similar reprimand, although all of them are experiencing similar financial pressures. </p> <p>The Bradford governors were told in a letter from the trust secretary: \"A financial recovery plan has been developed by the trust with wide-ranging action designed to reduce costs and bring budgets into line, but [the regulator] has continued to express concern in relation to possible cashflow problems towards the end of the current financial year.\" </p> <p>The letter later referred to \"our current acute financial difficulties\". </p> <p>William Moyes, chairman of Monitor, the foundation trust regulatory body, said: \"The current financial position at Bradford in no way affects the quality of care for patients. </p> <p>\"However, it is important that there is a robust plan in place to improve the trust's financial position. </p> <p>\"We have agreed with the board that we will work jointly with them in the appointment of external professional advisers.\" The company Alvarez and Marsal has been called in to do the job. </p> <p>Mr Dobson said: \"If consultants are investigating Bradford hospitals, they should also be investigating the regulator. It is only six months since he looked at the trust's finances and said they were in good enough nick to qualify for foundation status.\"</p>",

For this reason alone, we welcome those sections of the bill that would allow more casinos to open. We see no great difference, in principle, between roulette and the lottery, blackjack and the local betting shop. We find it odd that some newspapers preach against casinos, while employing racing tipsters and carrying advertisements for online betting.

  "The Foreign Office is to protest to Turkey about the detention and expulsion of British citizens because of alleged \"discrepancies\" in their UK passports. <p>On at least two occasions this summer, Turkish immigration officials prevented travellers who had recorded their place of birth as \"Kurdistan\" from entering the country. No compensation was paid for their flights or ruined holidays. </p> <p>Turkey - which has enacted far-reaching human rights reforms as it attempts to join the EU - is fighting separatist guerrillas who are trying to establish an autonomous Kurdish state in the south-east of the country. </p> <p>Although Brussels has asked for specific progress in the area of Kurdish human rights, use of the term \"Kurdistan\" is still often officially disparaged in Turkey. </p> <p>There are as many as 25 million Kurds, living mainly in Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria. They are the largest stateless ethnic group in the Middle East; hundreds of thousands of them have fled to western Europe. </p> <p>The two incidents being investigated by British diplomats occurred at Istanbul airport. In one, a minor, thought to be travelling alone, was stopped by immigration officials on August 24, detained and then put on a plane back to Britain. </p> <p>His UK passport gave his place of birth as \"Kurdistan\". His mother and their MP have raised the case with the Foreign Office. </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said yesterday: \"I understand that under Turkish law, [travellers] of any nationality can be deported if their passport has a discrepancy, and the word Kurdistan can be classed as a discrepancy. But it's not satisfactory for people to be turned round and sent back. We are writing to the Turkish foreign affairs ministry to express our concern at these incidents. </p> <p>\"We take it very seriously. We are seeking an explanation. Our consular office in Istanbul has also been in touch with Turkish immigration officials.\" </p> <p>The Foreign Office is also considering altering its travel advice for Turkey to warn those who come from the region and have been granted UK citizenship that they may encounter problems if they refer to \"Kurdistan\" in their passports. The Passport Office has also been alerted. </p> <p>The second case involves the Ibrahim family from Croydon, south London, who were held at Istanbul airport on August 28 before being put on a flight back to Britain. They are planning to sue the Turkish government. </p> <p>Suzan Ibrahim, 31, a lawyer, and her husband Honar, 38, a graphic designer, arrived at Istanbul with their one-year-old son and three-year-old daughter. The parents were born in Sulaimaniya in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. They were planning to travel through Turkey to visit friends and family still living there. </p> <p>\"We hold valid British passports,\" Mrs Ibrahim said. \"When we arrived at the airport the immigration officials saw that [we] had written Kurdistan as our place of birth in our passports. We wanted to recognise that we are from Kurdistan, and the British government obviously didn't have any problem with that. </p> <p>\"But the Turkish officials put us all in a room where the lights were left on all night. The children couldn't sleep. The officials humiliated us, saying racist things about Kurds. We lost our tickets as well, and the airline refused to give us a refund.\" </p> <p>The family eventually travelled to Iraq via Syria. </p> <p>The Turkish embassy in London yesterday said it was unaware of the incidents.</p>",
  "All pregnant women will be asked during routine antenatal appointments if they have been a victim of domestic violence, ministers announced yesterday at a conference on the issue. <p>The crackdown on domestic violence was launched as research was published which showed that 30% of cases begin or intensify during pregnancy. </p> <p>Women will be asked discreet questions by their midwife or doctor during routine antenatal check-ups. The Department of Health acknowledged that medical staff would have to be careful not to ask sensitive questions in front of the woman's partner. </p> <p>Melanie Johnson, public health minister, said an advisory board had been formed to draw up plans to introduce the scheme. \"The fact that domestic violence starts or escalates during pregnancy and is associated with increased risks of miscarriage, low birth weight, premature birth, foetal injury and foetal death makes for stark reading,\" she said. </p> <p>\"By including routine inquiry when women go for antenatal appointments, health professionals may be able to establish whether women are at risk or have experienced any domestic violence during their pregnancy. </p> <p>\"This is an effective means of ensuring that appropriate support and advice is offered at an early stage.\" </p> <p>One in four women will experience domestic violence. Victims tend to suffer repeated attacks (an average of 35) before they seek help. Many will go on to have mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. </p> <p>A pilot project, funded by the Department of Health and carried out by the University of West England and the Bristol NHS Trust, found routine enquiries about domestic violence were well received by pregnant women and picked up cases of abuse. </p> <p>The advisory group will be headed by Gwyneth Lewis, a senior medical adviser at the Department of Health. </p> <p>Nicola Harwin, director of Women's Aid, said: \"Health professionals are well positioned to identify women experiencing domestic violence and signpost them to appropriate support and information.\" </p> <p>A domestic violence, crime and victims bill is currently going through parliament. It includes measures to provide additional protection and support for people affected by domestic violence. </p> <p>The health minister Rosie Winterton said the government was looking at changing the situation where women experiencing domestic violence had come into contact with up to 10 agencies before their needs were recognised. </p> <p>Dame Karlene Davis, of the Royal College of Midwives, said: \"Midwives and other healthcare professionals will now be better able to identify and help victims of domestic violence as long as the government follows through with the adequate resources.\"</p>",
  "For the record, we haven't really done sectarianism on Merseyside since the childhood of my octogenarian grandfather (Scouse for cripes! October 19). The Protestant/Catholic football divide is the stuff of myths. True, Everton started out as St Domingo's - linked to a local Methodist church - but the distinction ends there. If only fans of a Protestant bent in an overwhelmingly Catholic city attended Goodison, there is simply no way Everton would have been able to attract the crowds that ensured their place in football's aristocracy. Both Everton and Liverpool are famous for being able to split families along red and blue lines - how then would the sectarianism prevail? <br> <b>James Corbett</b> <br> Author, Everton: The School of Science <p>With votes from the Protestant working-class, the Tories controlled the council until Labour seized power in 1955 - the last of the large cities to come under their control. In the 1959 election, the Tories won six out of nine parliamentary seats. Even in 1979 they were able to win the Liverpool contest for the Euro elections. After the first dose of Thatcherism, Liverpool became a Tory-free zone. This now extends to the council, where even leafy Woolton has abandoned them. After Boris's little intervention, I can't see this changing any time soon.<br> <b>Richard Knights</b><br> Liverpool </p> <p>So Michael Howard is a supporter of Liverpool FC.

  "<p>Entering a hospital was once a death sentence. \"Every cure stands still, every wound becomes a sore and every sore is apt to run into gangrene,\" wrote John Bell, the pioneering Scottish surgeon, in 1780.</p> <p>Before antiseptics, patients were five times more likely to die from an operation carried out in hospital than one done at home. Any patient who could afford it insisted their surgeon make a house call: in 1810, the novelist Fanny Burney endured a mastectomy in her bedroom - without anaesthetic.</p> <p>Modern hospitals bear little surface resemblance to 18th-century dying rooms. Since Victorian times, they have been symbols of modern medicine, and politicians close them at their peril. But hospitals kill many people: 40,000 NHS patients die annually because of \"adverse events\", according to Dr Foster, a medical research firm.</p> <p>Now, however, the pendulum may be swinging back to home care, thanks to IT. \"Hospitals are infection factories,\" says Dr Ricky Richardson, a consultant at Great Ormond Street children's hospital in London. For years, Richardson has been a passionate advocate for using IT-based care to reverse the trend towards hospital-centred medicine.</p> <p>Dr Paul Johnson, of the telemonitoring research centre at John Radcliffe hospital, Oxford, says that patients equipped with hi-tech, low-cost \"telemonitors\" can be encouraged into better health at a fraction of the cost of hospital treatment.</p> <p>With billions being poured into new <a href=\"http://www.npfit.nhs.uk\">NHS IT systems</a>, there is a chance for e-health to become routine. So far, however, the programme has emphasised getting patients into hospital, not keeping them away.</p> <p>The revolution will come from two health care information technologies - telemedicine and telecare.</p> <p>Telemedicine has been around since the early 1960s. It covers any arrangement for diagnosing and treating disease remotely, via everything from a telephone call to videoconferencing. At least one pilot project even relied on digital photographs sent through the post - bandwidth was expensive and it was quicker than sending the patient in person. </p> <p> Clinical trials have shown that conditions such as skin cancer can be detected remotely on a consultant's screen, while x-ray images and data from heart monitors can be assessed thousands of miles from the patient. Telemedicine has been used for years out of necessity in remote parts of the world, and in places where doctors don't want to go: one early installation was in a Texas prison.</p> <p> Telecare covers the use of IT to monitor people's health at home or in their daily routines. It is newer than telemedicine because it depends on the technology being cheap enough to hand out to patients, rather than being kept inside the health service.</p> <p>One of the most promising uses of telecare is to allow elderly and other vulnerable people to stay in their homes rather than go into residential care. This week, the London borough of Newham demonstrated what could be possible in a \"show home\" packed with telecare sensors. </p> <p> The flat, in a tower block of sheltered accommodation, contains sensors to detect movement, extremes of temperature, gas leaks, whether the resident has got up from a chair or out of bed, and whether the bathroom has flooded. The front door has a \"bogus callers\" button that can be pressed if the resident thinks she is being hit by a distraction burglar.</p> <p> Each sensor communicates wirelessly, on the 869MHz frequency, the European standard for telecare, with an alarm device that phones an alert through to a control room over a normal line. Each device has a unique electronic identity, so it will not set off an alarm in a neighbour's flat.</p> <p>Newham is not the first council to use telecare. Local authorities such as Lothian in Scotland and Liverpool City have similar systems. Liverpool is trialling a telecare system in six homes. A network of sensors monitors the resident's daily movements. They report to a PC in the house, which learns the person's daily routine. If the PC detects something out of character, it triggers action.</p> <p>Telecare for the elderly is potentially big business. In July, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced funding for 1.5m \"care alarms\" by 2008.</p> <p> An even more promising development is to help people take control of their health. Studies have shown that patients who monitor their blood pressure, for example, are more healthy than those who have it done in the consulting room. According to a study published in the British Medical Journal in July, home monitoring reduces the incidence of \"white coat hypertension\" - the rise in blood pressure caused by a doctor strapping a sphygnomanometer to your arm. The procedure also involves patients more closely in looking after their health.</p> <p>In Oxford, Johnson sees the ability to monitor patients' vital signs remotely as a way to healthcare that is both cheaper and more effective than putting people in hospital. One trial involves remote foetal monitoring, by giving pregnant teenagers a \"belly bra\" with built-in ultrasound sensors that relay data to a central monitoring station via mobile phone signals. Johnson says that this kind of technology is ideal for reaching young teenagers who are often socially disadvantaged and ignore conventional health services.</p> <p>Johnson says the national NHS programme for IT represents a \"unique opportunity to provide the vehicle for equality of care and support the public ... in adopting cost-saving, life-enhancing self-care\". The specification of the programme's \u00a36bn care records service says that e-health and telemedicine technologies will be an essential part.</p> <p>For the moment, the programme is occupied with more mundane things: replacing the NHS-wide network and getting an electronic appointment-booking service up and running to fulfill the government's promise to offer choice of hospitals.</p> <p>However, the system of shared electronic health records being created by the programme is an essential ingredient of telecare. Patients will no longer rely on a single institution holding their record - it will be updated wherever they come into contact with the health service.</p> <p>At public appearances, Richard Granger, the NHS IT chief, has begun to talk about the programme as enabling the treatment of patients away from hospital, and of patients taking control of their records. At an IT conference in London recently, he asked the audience how many had a record of their car's service history. A forest of arms appeared. However, not one admitted keeping a copy of their health record. \"That's what we want to change,\" Granger said.</p> <p>But it will be years before the national programme catches up with the best local efforts to give patients access to their health records.</p> <p>Dr Brian Fisher, a GP in Sydenham, south London, provides patients with a kiosk in his waiting room where they can read their record and get electronic advice. The touch screen is a version of the doctor's practice management system, from Emis, a specialist British firm that dominates the GP computing market. Access is controlled by a fingerprint reader.</p> <p>Patients see everything in the doctor's record, apart from information about third parties. Results of tests are labelled to show whether they are normal or whether the patient should see the doctor. Fisher stresses that patients don't suddenly get hit with bad news. \"We wouldn't put anything on the system that would have frightening implications without talking to the patient first.\"</p> <p>Patients can print off records and in future, they will be able to burn an encrypted CD. Fisher has been sharing paper records for 18 years and reckons about three-quarters of patients look at them. Computer access was a logical step now that the practice keeps all its records electronically.</p> <p>The system also helps patients make difficult decisions, for example whether to have surgery. A library of decision aids in the kiosk takes patients through the process and advises them of side effects. This is an important facility: Fisher estimates that three-quarters of his patients don't have the internet at home.</p> <p>By 2008 or thereabouts, every patient in the NHS in England should have access to their electronic medical record. (Scotland and Wales have broadly similar goals, though they are going about them differently.)</p> <p>However, whether the NHS uses new IT as a reason to shed some hospitals depends on political and cultural as well as medical factors. Even as the NHS invests billions in IT, it continues to borrow money to build new hospitals.</p> <p>Clinically, the trend is away from disease-palaces and towards short stays and day-care in specialist centres. Last week, a study in the BMJ claimed that a heart surgical procedure similar to the one carried out on Tony Blair early this month could be safely carried out by a nurse in a day surgery unit.</p> <p>However, thanks to the animosity between clinicians and NHS administrators, attempts to move procedures out of hospitals are often attacked as cost cutting. Last week's BMJ paper attracted a flood of correspondence voicing fears about the consequences for training junior doctors.</p> <p>There is a precedent. In the last century, the Royal Navy clung to big ships because senior officers needed something to command and junior officers somewhere to learn. Today's big teaching hospitals are the NHS's dreadnoughts. And like dreadnoughts, hospitals are political dynamite. Hospitals are still vote winners, even if people die there.</p>",
  "<p>Researchers last night called for further investigation into whether babies born by caesarean section were at extra risk of food allergies and diarrhoea. </p> <p>Children born into families with a history of allergies were monitored as part of a German infant nutrition programme, and it was found that those born by caesarean were twice as likely to be sensitive to cows' milk and other allergens as those born naturally. </p> <p>The babies were also more likely to get diarrhoea up to one year old. Only those born by planned caesarean section at full-term, rather than prematurely, or because of an emergency procedure, were included in the study. </p> <p>Researchers suggested the sterile atmosphere of the operating theatre may deprive infants of bacteria that help their immune systems develop. </p> <p>Caesareans have become an increasingly popular choice in developing countries, provoking debate over the risks to women and babies. </p> <p>The team, from the children's hospital at Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, said all the babies in the survey had been breastfed up to four months old. </p> <p>Blood samples were taken at 12 months to check for antibodies to allergens such as eggs, cows' milk protein and soya protein. </p> <p>Writing in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, the team suggests the results are in line with others indicating that gut bacteria are important in developing immune responses. Circumstances linked to the caesarean sections might alter or delay normal bacterial colonisation of the infant's intestines. </p> <p>In all, 855 babies were monitored. \"The colonisation of vaginally delivered newborns is influenced by the mother's vaginal, intestinal and perianal flora, whereas infants delivered by caesarean section are colonised with bacteria from the hospital environment.\" </p> <p>They say reports on the clinical significance of the microbiological findings in babies are scarce and conflicting when it comes to gastrointestinal symptoms. There have also been differences between studies examining the association between caesarean delivery and allergic diseases such as asthma.</p>",
  "<p>Nearly half of all doctors believe colleagues help patients to commit suicide by providing drugs or are more directly involved in their death, a survey designed to influence the right-to-die debate suggested last night. </p> <p>An online questionnaire indicated that 45% of doctors thought other health professionals were helping patients to die. Just over a quarter, 27% of the 1,000 polled for the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, said they had been asked by a patient for help to die. </p> <p>More than half, 51%, favoured regulation with safeguards rather than use of the criminal law, which was defended by only 21%, but 53% also said they did not believe a doctor should directly help a person to die under any circumstances. </p> <p>The response on whether doctors should help in suicide through providing drugs, for instance, was mixed: 42% said this should not happen under any circumstances and 45% said it was permissible when a patient was terminally ill, with unbearable suffering. </p> <p>The survey, by Medix UK, came as a Lords select committee discussed a bill put forward by Lord Joffe which would allow doctors to legally assist terminally ill adults undergoing unbearable suffering to die. </p> <p>Lord Joffe and other campaigners argue this would regulate and provide safeguards in a situation in which assisted dying is already taking place. In some rare cases, where patients were physically unable to do so, doctors could administer the life-ending drugs for them. </p> <p>This is to cover cases like that of Diane Pretty, who had motor neurone disease, but failed in a legal battle to allow her husband to help her take her own life without risking prosecution. </p> <p>Although the debate has been raging for years, the questioning of doctors' motives has become more sensitive in the aftermath of the Harold Shipman murder scandal. </p> <p>Doctors at present can increase pain relief, knowing this might cause death, so long as the main intention is to relieve pain. Professional bodies also have guidelines on the withdrawal or withholding of life-prolonging treatment. </p> <p>The British Medical Association opposes the bill, saying it would worsen doctor-patient relationships. Michael Wilks, chairman of its ethics committee, said even the new survey demonstrated doctors were opposed to euthanasia. </p> <p>\"Physician-assisted suicide has been debated many times at the BMA's annual meetings and on every occasion the membership has decided against calling for a change in the law,\" he said. </p> <p>The royal colleges of physicians and general practitioners say society must decide. But the physicians have also argued that medical issues need to be settled, such as diagnosis, conscientious objection by doctors and proper documentation to ensure those who requested help to die were informed enough to do so of their own free will. </p> <p>Debbie Annetts, chief executive of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, said: \"Doctors are faced with the awful choice of either respecting their terminally ill patients and helping them to die in the full knowledge that they could be prosecuted and face imprisonment, or abandoning their patient to yet more suffering at the end of life.\" </p> <p>Evan Harris, the Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, and a former doctor, said: \"When more than a quarter of doctors are being asked for help to die, and around half of doctors are willing to act on these requests, it demonstrates that the current law is both cruel and in part ineffective.\" </p> <p>Nick Gideonse, a doctor from the US state of Oregon, which allows doctor-assisted dying, said he had been involved in prescribing a deadly barbiturate dose for five patients, four of whom had then taken the drug. In all, more than 200 patients had opted for assisted death in the state since 1997, although doctors were not allowed to physically assist patients die. </p> <p>\"The law has functioned extremely well,\" said Dr Gideonse. Fears about a \"slippery slope\" of increasingly vulnerable patients, unclear prognoses and botched attempts to assist dying had not come to pass. </p> <p>The fact that end-of-life issues could be addressed meant that delivery of palliative care and pain relief by health professionals in the state had been improved, too.</p>",
  "In a campaign in which George Bush and John Kerry have shown little compunction for indulging in insults and barbs, it was perhaps inevitable that their wives would be drawn into the fray. <p>Teresa Heinz Kerry drew first blood yesterday, telling an interviewer that Laura Bush had never held \"a real job\", seemingly overlooking the fact that she worked for a decade as a librarian and schoolteacher in the 1970s. </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry apologised almost immediately but the gaffe drew expressions of outrage from Republican spin masters who accused the wife of the Democratic challenger of disrespecting America's mothers and homemakers. </p> <p>The would-be first lady had been trying to explain to the USA Today newspaper that she would make a rather different first lady from the demure and retiring Ms Bush. </p> <p>As mistress of the White House, Mrs Bush is viewed as an even more traditional First Lady than her mother-in-law, Barbara Bush. Until the election season got under way - and Mrs Bush proved to be a vote getter - she was rarely visible. Her personal mission as First Lady to promote reading was determinedly low key. </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry, in contrast, has said she is determined to carry on with her life's work if she moves to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, managing the philanthropic trusts of the Heinz Foundation . </p> <p>But Ms Heinz Kerry's talent for talking herself into trouble often distracts from her more serious concerns about healthcare and the environment. Earlier this year, she was pilloried for telling a rightwing commentator to shove it, and for telling a heckler at a rally that Mr Bush's re-election would lead to \"four more years of hell\". </p> <p>Yesterday's comments about Mrs Bush's career resum\u00e9 had the same effect. </p> <p>\"Well, you know, I don't know Laura Bush,\" Ms Heinz Kerry told USA Today. \"She seems to be calm, and she has a sparkle in her eye, which is good. But I don't know that she's ever had a real job - I mean, since she's been grown up.\" </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry apologised hours later, noting that Ms Bush had indeed worked as a librarian and schoolteacher before marrying at the age of 30 and having twin daughters. </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry's spell in the workforce was also brief. After marriage to her first husband, John Heinz, she gave up work as a translator and focused on bringing up their three sons. </p> <p>But Ms Heinz Kerry's apology was not swift enough for Karen Hughes, one of Mr Bush's closest advisers. </p> <p>\"Being a librarian is a real job. Being a teacher is a real job,\" Ms Hughes told CNN television. \"These comments are an unfortunate way of trying to drive a wedge between women who choose to work at home and women who work outside the home.\"</p>",
  "Passing almost without notice earlier this month, the public release of The Civil Rights Record of the George W Bush Administration - the official staff report prepared by the US Civil Rights Commission - whose submission is required by federal law, was blocked by the Republican commissioners. None the less, it was posted on the commission's website: \"This report finds that President Bush has neither exhibited leadership on pressing civil rights issues, nor taken actions that matched his words.\" <p>Bush has held the Civil Rights Commission in contempt since its June 2001 report on Election Practices in Florida During the 2000 Campaign. Then it concluded: \"The commission's findings make one thing clear: widespread voter disenfranchisement - not the dead-heat contest - was the extraordinary feature in the Florida election ... The disenfranchisement of Florida's voters fell most harshly on the shoulders of black voters.\" </p> <p>Vast efforts to mobilise or suppress African-American, Hispanic and Democratic voters have already reached a greater level of intensity than in any modern campaign. The Republicans in Ohio, for example, have attempted to toss out new Democratregistrations because it was claimed they were written on the wrong weight of paper, a gambit overruled by a federal court. From Pennsylvania to Arizona, a Republican consulting firm is discouraging new Democratic voters from getting on the rolls. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Democratic party has more than 10,000 lawyers deployed to defend against voter suppression, 2,000 stationed in Florida; civil rights groups are sending out more than 6,000 lawyers. Bush v Gore remains an open wound; and now the battle over voting rights, over democracy itself, is being fought again. </p> <p>Since 2002, when Republicans exploited terrorism to besmirch the patriotism of Democrats in the midterm elections, what can only be called a new Democratic party has been summoned into existence by extra-party groups. More than 100,000 activists are tramping through the precincts. In Ohio alone, more than 300,000 new Democratic voters have been added, Cecile Richards, director of America Votes, told me. These registrations of literally millions of new voters did not just happen; they were organised. </p> <p>The polls, nearly all showing a dead-even race, fail to account for the new voters, who have no past records. They do not measure those for whom a mobile is their main phone - 6% of the population - who will vote Democrat by a margin of two-and-a-half to one. </p> <p>The Democracy Corps poll, however, filters in newly registered voters. Four months ago, the newly registered made up only 1% of the sample. One month ago, they comprised 4%. Now they are at 7% and rising. And they will vote for Kerry over Bush by 61% to 37%. </p> <p>Bush's job approval has fallen now to 47 in this poll; presidents below 50 always lose. Bush has not campaigned in Ohio for three weeks, though he plans to stop there this week. Unemployment continues to rise in the state. \"There is no other explanation for his absence,\" says Stanley Greenberg, Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign pollster, \"other than his numbers go down when he's there. His position on jobs is implausible.\" </p> <p>Democracy Corps research shows that best-case arguments for either candidate shift no voters. The deciding factor will be turnout: the higher the turnout the larger the vote for Democrats. </p> <p>Since September 11 infused Bush with a mission, he has evoked hovering angels, crusades, mushroom clouds, evildoers, shades of a universe of death. His imagery induces a dynamic of paralysis before the threat and fervour in embrace of his absolute reassurance and power. Dread without end requires faith without limit. </p> <p>Yet Bush found himself on the defensive when the New York Times reported on the closed gathering of his campaign contributors, where he revealed his radical programme for his second term - rightwing capture of the supreme court, privatising social security, turning over national land to the oil companies, more tax cuts. Kerry was prompted to raise these issues. And Bush whined that Kerry was practising \"the politics of fear\".

  "The undisputed facts are these: it was broad daylight, 13-year-old Iman al-Hams was wearing her school uniform, and when she walked into the Israeli army's \"forbidden zone\" at the bottom of her street she was carrying her satchel. A few minutes later the short, slight child was pumped with bullets. Doctors counted at least 17 wounds and said much of her head was destroyed. <p>Beyond that there is little agreement between the army top brass and Palestinian witnesses as to how Iman came to die last week, or even among members of the military unit responsible for killing the child in Gaza's Rafah refugee camp. </p> <p>Palestinian witnesses described the shooting as cold-blooded. They say soldiers could not have failed to see they were firing at a child, and she was killed as she already lay wounded and helpless. </p> <p>\"Some soldiers were lying on the ground and shooting very heavily toward her,\" said Basim Breaka, who saw the killing from her living room. \"Then one of the soldiers walked to her and emptied his clip into her. For sure she died on the second or third bullet. I could see her lying on the ground, not moving. I can't imagine why that soldier wanted to shoot her after she was dead.\" </p> <p>This week an army investigation cleared the unit's commander after some of his own soldiers accused him of giving the order to shoot knowing the target was a young girl, and of then emptying the clip of his automatic rifle into her. </p> <p>On the day she died, Iman left home shortly before 7am for the short walk to school in Rafah's Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood. The school, facing the heavily militarised border with Egypt, is under the shadow of a towering camouflaged Israeli gunpost. </p> <p>Like almost every other building in the area, Iman's school is pockmarked by bullets. Last year, a 13-year-old boy was shot dead by the army outside the school. This year, two pupils and a teacher were wounded by bullets inside the grounds. </p> <p>Iman walked past her school with her satchel over her shoulder, crossed the road and climbed down a small sandy bank to an area that was an olive and citrus orchard until the army's bulldozers flattened it in April. She had entered the \"forbidden zone\" next to the watchtower where any Palestinian risks being shot. </p> <p>The schoolgirl kept on walking toward the tower but was still several hundred metres away when two shots caught her in the leg. She dropped her bag, turned, tried to hobble away, and fell. </p> <p>Four or five soldiers emerged from the army post and shot at her from a distance. Palestinian witnesses and some Israeli soldiers say that the platoon commander moved in closer to put two bullets in the child's head. They say that he then walked away, turned back and fired a stream of bullets into her body. </p> <p>Iman's corpse was taken to Rafah's hospital and inspected by Dr Mohammed al-Hams. \"She has at least 17 bullets in several parts of the body, all along the chest, hands, arms, legs,\" he said. \"The bullets were large and shot from a close distance. The most serious injuries were to her head. She had three bullets in the head. One bullet was shot from the right side of the face beside the ear. It had a big impact on the whole face. Another bullet went from the neck to the face and damaged the area under the mouth.\" </p> <p>The doctor said that the nature of the wounds suggested that Iman was already dead when some of the bullets hit her. The army swiftly blamed Iman for her own death by entering the forbidden zone. At first, the military said soldiers suspected the girl was carrying a bomb in her satchel. When it turned out there was no bomb, it said she was being used by Palestinian combatants to lure troops from their post. </p> <p>But some soldiers in the unit responsible, the Shaked battalion, were outraged at what they saw as a cover-up. One told Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that a soldier in the watchtower had told the company commander that he was about to shoot a child: \"Don't shoot, it's a little girl\". </p> <p>\"The company commander approached her, shot two bullets into her, walked back towards the force, turned back to her, switched his weapon to automatic and emptied his entire magazine into her. We were in shock. We couldn't believe what he was doing. Our hearts ached for her. Just a girl of 13,\" a soldier told the newspaper. </p> <p>Other soldiers said that if the company commander was not dismissed they would refuse to serve under him: \"It is a disgrace that he is still in his position. We want him kicked out.\" </p> <p>The accounts of Palestinian witnesses back the claims of the protesting soldiers. </p> <p>Fuad Zourob was working at a small brick factory overlooking the area where Iman was shot. \"The girl was walking in the sand. She was shot from the army post. She was hit in the leg and she was crawling. </p> <p>\"Then she stood up and started to try and run and then she fell. The shooting went on. The soldiers arrived by foot. One came close to the girl and started to shoot. He walked away, turned back and then shot her some more,\" he said. </p> <p>Yousef Breaka watched from the balcony of his second floor flat. He owns the 12 acres of bulldozed land beside the building which Iman crossed minutes before she was shot. </p> <p>\"The first shot came from the army post. It hit her in the leg. She was starting to walk on and then fell. She dropped her bag. They were firing, heavy shooting. I am sure she died before the two soldiers came and shot her bag and then her,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Breaka's living room wall is decorated with the holes of nine bullets fired from the Israeli army watchtower two years ago. A tenth bullet killed his 80-year-old mother, Jindiya. </p> <p>Neither Iman's father, Samir al-Hams, nor the witnesses know why the girl walked into the forbidden zone. </p> <p>\"I can't explain why she was there. I've asked everyone and no one can explain it. Perhaps she just wanted to walk on the sand. Perhaps she was confused. I don't know,\" said Mr al-Hams. </p> <p>Mr Zourob was surprised to see Iman walking at the back of his factory. \"I was astonished. I didn't know why she was there. No one goes toward that area. She was alone but some of the schoolchildren were calling her: Iman, why are you there?\" he said. </p> <p>The watchtower sits atop a large hill of sand. It is surrounded by barbed wire and other defences. Even before she was hit in the leg, it would have taken Iman 10 minutes or more to scramble up the hill. Once she was wounded, there was little chance she could have got to the watchtower. </p> <p>If she was carrying a bomb, it could have harmed Israeli troops had she got close enough to them. But after Iman was shot in the leg she dropped her school bag. </p> <p>Palestinian witnesses say soldiers pumped it full of bullets, establishing that it was not a bomb, but still went on to shoot the girl. </p> <p>The Israeli army's rules of engagement permit soldiers to wound a person who enters a security zone and does not heed warning shots to leave. But once the person is wounded, soldiers are only permitted to kill if there is an imminent threat to their lives. Witnesses say Iman was helpless and posed no such threat. </p> <p>Her father is a teacher at a primary school neighbouring his daughter's. \"The day Iman was killed, the headmistress of her school called me at 8.15 and asked why she wasn't at school. I said I had no idea.,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I ran to the school. The teachers and headmistress told me the army shot toward a small girl but she was fine, don't worry. I calmed down a bit when I heard that and thought maybe they shot toward her to make her afraid and arrested her for interrogation and they will release her. But then they declared her dead. That was the worst moment in my life.\" </p> <p>This week, the officer responsible for the Gaza strip, Major General Dan Harel, completed his investigation and pronounced that the company commander had not acted unethically in the shooting of Iman but was being suspended for losing the confidence of his soldiers. </p> <p>The speed of the investigation has revealed once again the cursory nature of the army's inquiries into such shootings. A more thorough investigation usually only follows if there is external pressure, such as in the case of three Britons shot dead by Israeli soldiers over the past two years. </p> <p>The military has quietly dropped an investigation into the killing by an Israeli sniper of a brother and sister, both teenagers, in Rafah in May. The army falsely claimed that the pair were killed by a Palestinian bomb and only began the investigation after journalists found the bodies of the children and reported that both had a single shot to the head. </p> <p>Under pressure from the revelations of the Shaked battalion soldiers, the military police has launched a separate investigation into the death of Iman al-Hams. The soldiers say they will insist that it is completed.</p>",
  "Massachusetts scientists are working on a scarf that can read air pollution, and a handbag that never forgets. Both have been made possible by tiny patches of computerised fabric that contain a microprocessor and radio transceiver, sensor, microphone, batteries or a display system, New Scientists reports today. <p>The pay off?

Now a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's world-famous media lab are working on a variation: wearables that you can design to order. </p> <p>Michael Bove, Adrian Cable and Gauri Nanda have fashioned a build-your-own bag for the forgetful. Its little smart patches, linked by Velcro wired for electrical current, will listen for signals from radio frequency identification tags on cellphones, keyrings and wallets.

If one of them is missing, a voice synthesiser will say: \"Cellphone: yes. Wallet: yes. Keys: no!\" </p> <p>The scientists also plan to add a chip that would automatically download updated weather reports. The bossy briefcase would remind its owner to take an umbrella - but only if rain was on the way. The patches could be used on belts, bags, curtains or scarves. They could be configured in a variety of ways to serve a variety of purposes </p> <p>\"People would add functionality to their bag, just as they download ringtones for their phones today,\" Dr Bove told the magazine.</p>",
  "<p>In 1988, the world's foremost scientific journal, Nature, rocked the scientific world and the media with a paper that appeared to demonstrate that homeopathy worked. </p> <p>A team of French allergy researchers led by Jacques Benveniste, who has died aged 69, described how an allergy test worked even when the reagent - the substance to be used in the chemical reaction - was so diluted with water that the odds were against a single molecule remaining. Benveniste, a biologist and immunologist, argued that the water used for dilution \"remembered\" the molecule that had been diluted out of existence. </p> <p>Nature had printed the article on condition that it could appoint three experts to observe the experiment being replicated. The trio were John (now Sir John) Maddox, editor of Nature; James Randi, a professional magician, and Walter Stewart, an expert on science fraud. </p> <p>The three spent a week in Benveniste's Paris laboratory. The first day was spent talking; the second, planning; the third preparing blood cells and reagents for the test; and the fourth was devoted to the experiments. At the end of that session, the raw data was wrapped in tinfoil and taped to the ceiling, so that any attempt to tamper with it overnight would be noticed. </p> <p>The next morning, the tinfoil had been disturbed but not opened, as if an attempt to open it had been abandoned. The data was interpreted by Elisabeth Davenas, who had done the original research, and the results were significant; but when the labels were removed and she analysed the results \"blind\", they were shown to be random. </p> <p>It emerged that Benveniste had never performed the experiment himself, but had left it to Davenas, who had a special interest in homeopathy. She told the investigators that the experiment often did not work for months on end. In reality, she was examining very small amounts of data at a time, and discarding data that she felt was insignificant. </p> <p>After the investigation, Benveniste accused the investigators of McCarthyite witch-hunting. Maddox's view was that Benveniste was self-deluded, extraordinarily credulous, and so ignorant of the scientific methods that he did not understand that small samples of anything will vary according to chance. Randi's defence of the investigation was to argue that if he, Randi, said he kept a goat in his garden, people might be mildly surprised but they would be unlikely to disbelieve him. If, however, he said that he kept a unicorn in his garden, they might want to check how firmly its horn was attached. </p> <p>The results of the investigation appeared in Nature shortly afterwards. The findings earned the approval of the scientific community, but the opprobrium of homeopaths everywhere. Benveniste, who by now had a cult following, had abandoned his original research and steered his entire labora tory into investigating the idea that water molecules had memory. </p> <p>Two years later, then aged 55, Benveniste was sacked from his job at France's government-sponsored medical research body, the Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (Inserm). </p> <p>Jacques Benveniste had charisma, wit, charm, and film-star good looks. He was born into a well-to-do family in Paris, and was a racing driver until he was forced to retire after a back injury. His family then steered him into medicine. After qualifying at Paris University, he found that his back injury made stooping over patients difficult and he went into immunology research. </p> <p>From 1965 to 1969 he worked at CNRS, the French cancer research institute, and from 1969 to 1972 at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in California. He made a name for himself as one of a team that isolated a blood hormone called platelet-activating factor. </p> <p>Returning to France, he was appointed head of the Inserm immunology laboratory in Paris. Here he patented an allergy test called the basophil degranulation test. It was hardlyoriginal - he just gave it a commercial application. Most experts regard the test as useless. </p> <p>Benveniste published 230 scientific papers, many of them in reputable journals. Towards the end of his life he compared himself with Galileo and repeatedly stated that he was in the running for a Nobel Prize. He won not one but two of the satirical Ignobel prizes awarded by a gang of Harvard scientists - the 1991 chemistry prize for showing that water has memory, and the 1998 one for a paper showing that information can be transmitted over telephone lines and the internet. </p> <p>After seven years in the wilderness, Benveniste set up a company, DigiBio, in 1997, to promulgate his ideas. It was funded by France's largest manufacturer of homeopathic medicines, and by sympathisers. Its website, <a href=\"http://www.digibio.com\">www.digibio.com</a> gives its own account of the Nature debacle and appeals for funds from believers and supporters. </p> <p>Twice married, he is survived by five children. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jacques Benveniste, racing driver, immunologist and homeopathic businessman, born March 12 1935; died October 3 2004</p>",
  "<p>The other day, on one of those innumerable historical documentaries fronted by Tony Robinson, one of the talking heads - strictly speaking, a talking torso - was filmed offering his comments to camera while clutching a small bottle of mineral water. The message was clear: keeping hydrated is now such an urgent operation that no one, especially not an academic offering insights into the Peasants' Revolt, can risk being separated from his water supply for more than a few seconds. </p> <p>Everywhere you go you will find people attached to a bottle of Evian. This was understandable during last year's arid summer. But this autumn, which is already shaping up to be extremely lush, it is far from clear why people feel the need to keep topping themselves up as if they were ancient Morris Minors attempting to drive from London to Glasgow. </p> <p>Ten years ago no one felt obliged to slurp constantly and no one slumped to the floor during a sales meeting with dehydration. People weren't stretchered out of lectures suffering from sudden-onset kidney infections. Either our bodies have undergone swift evolutionary changes since 1995, or something has changed in the culture. </p> <p>Health concerns are nominally responsible. If you are supposed to drink a veritable river of two litres of water a day, then clearly you need to stay vigilant. But if that were all it was, a tumbler of water at elevenses, lunchtime and then again at the dull, dozy hour of half past three would achieve much more. </p> <p>No, the significance of the portable water bottle lies not deep in the body but in the culture at large. First, and most important, it is a way of marking the boundary between self and other. By drawing attention to your private space, your body, as a place where you are in charge (you nurture it, you answer its needs) you give yourself, and others, the message that, in this chaotic world, there is at least one part of your life over which you have complete control. </p> <p>Second, in a post-cigarette age, a small bottle of water gives you something to do with your hands. Fiddling with the bottle or clamping your lips to its neck is a great way of distracting people from the fact that you can't answer that tricky question, or don't want to get involved in a conversation. A sudden slurp punctuates a difficult exchange, or voicelessly announces that things are now at an end. </p> <p>Last year, at a meeting where I was keen to impress, I attempted to fill a lull in the conversation by taking a swig from my bottle. Missing my lips, I managed to throw the water over my chin, whereupon it dribbled down my neck and slowly disappeared down the front of my dress. </p> <p>After that, I hope that lugging round other bits of kit doesn't become essential to modern living. I am dreading the time, surely not far away, when oxygen cylinders become de rigueur. Getting one on the bus in rush hour is going to be a nightmare.</p>",
  "<p>The Champions League continues to be the showcase for Chelsea's pragmatism. An eager and accomplished CSKA Moscow were quelled by a side who depended on aerial expertise to score and fine reactions from Petr Cech to protect them. They have safeguarded their interests to such an extent that, with a perfect record of nine points from Group H, a place in the knock-out stage is virtually assured. </p> <p>That work has been completed in an unsettling period. Even if the public will withhold their tears, Jose Mourinho is a manager of slender means in one area now that Didier Drogba is injured and Adrian Mutu's life is populated by drug counsellors and officials who will sit in judgment on him. </p> <p>Chelsea are already undergoing a different sort of trial. They could not even round up a spare forward for the bench last night, with Mateja Kezman and Eidur Gudjohnsen in the starting line-up. But a freewheeling approach has never been essential to their plan. </p> <p>Porto had been blitzed in such situations at set pieces in the previous Champions League game here and those means gave Chelsea control by the close of the first half now. John Terry not only scored, as he had against the Portuguese, but was also a persistent threat. </p> <p>After nine minutes Frank Lampard hit a deep corner and, with the goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev distracting his own defence with a foolish attempt to intercept, Eidur Gudjohnsen was able to put a downwards header back across the target for Chelsea's captain to nod into the net. </p> <p>This occasion verged on a frolic for Terry and he was close again when smashing a Damien Duff cross marginally high and heading another Lampard delivery wide. Terry, though, eventually found his starring role usurped by one of the men paid to be specialist finishers. </p> <p>Lampard was deemed to have been brought down on the right by Evgeny Aldonin after 45 minutes and Duff bent an inswinging free-kick on to the head of Gudjohnsen, who hit the net for the first time since the opening weekend of the season. </p> <p>The goals might have been incidental to Mourinho, so quick was he to talk later about CSKA being confined in the second half when he switched the busy Alexei Smertin to the left to shut off an avenue favoured by the visitors. </p> <p>Mourinho did appreciate the value of a goal to Gudjohnsen. \"It is important for the boy to recover some confidence,\" he said. The manager would take back Carlton Cole from Aston Villa immediately but the striker can be recalled from his loan only in January, by which time both Arjen Robben and Drogba should be available. </p> <p>Mourinho wants to keep his squad together. The late outing for Scott Parker was only the second short sighting of him this season, but Mourinho has no intention of selling him to Charlton or anyone else. He says the midfielder has no desire to leave either. </p> <p>The 33,945 crowd was 5,000 less than the gate for Porto. \"Maybe they are so confident of the club being in the next stage that they think we don't need them,\" Mourinho mused. Whatever the interpretation, supporters are not captivated by his team's style. </p> <p>The opposition were the more exuberant side. Roman Abramovich, Chelsea's owner, has presented CSKA with the most lucrative sponsorship in world football and he might have winced at the sight of the good use being made of that \u00a310m a year. CSKA were far more effective than predicted. </p> <p>The striker Ivica Olic was one of several significant absentees. So it was a shock for Chelsea to be subjected to panache from CSKA. In the fourth minute Vagner Love delicately put Daniel Carvalho through and the Brazilian's shot was turned behind by Cech. </p> <p>The goalkeeper was also at full length to reach Sergey Ignashevich's drive in the 32nd minute. Ten minutes later the Czech reacted marvellously to push the ball over after a corner deflected off Gudjohnsen. </p> <p>In a match of much goalmouth incident, life continued to be uneventful for Kezman. In 29 previous Champions League games he had scored only three times, so he was never likely to open his Chelsea account here. More, all the same, is expected. He barely featured before being booked for a challenge on Deividas Semberas and substituted not long afterwards. </p>",
  "<p>Craig Bellamy has been told by Newcastle's manager Graeme Souness that he will have no future at St James' Park if he continues to attract publicity for reasons that have nothing to do with his performances on the pitch. </p> <p>Souness spelled that out at a squad meeting he called on Tuesday in the wake of an incident involving Bellamy last weekend, when the Wales striker appeared to swear at his manager on being substituted midway through the second half at Charlton. Though Souness's words were not directed solely at Bellamy, the subtext seems plain. </p> <p>Souness and Bellamy ended up arguing, increasing the ill-feeling between the former Coventry player and his manager, and the fallout of the past four days could see Bellamy leave Newcastle during January's transfer window. </p> <p>Souness has taken a firm tone without suggesting his relationship with Bellamy is irreparable, though it is unclear whether Bellamy shares that sentiment. He has not been happy in any event at spending time on the wing rather than as a central striker. What is plain is that Souness will not tolerate behaviour such as Bellamy's on Sunday, which was captured on television. </p> <p>\"What happened yesterday [at the meeting] was a case of me pointing out what I expect from our players,\" Souness said. \"Over the past week we have made headlines for the wrong reasons and I am determined to stamp out non-football matters. </p> <p>\"Our supporters need to know what is going on at this football club but it has to be footballing stories that people are writing. The players are aware of how I think of non-footballing stories taking our eye off the ball. We have a big European game tomorrow and we don't need distractions.\" </p> <p>Souness reiterated the point in his pre-match press conference. \"I'm not here to talk about anything other than what's going to happen tomorrow night in the 90 minutes. Don't waste your breath because I won't be answering any questions on it.\" </p> <p>The European game is this evening's opening Uefa Cup group match against Panionios. It is not certain whether Bellamy will start and Souness would be making a big statement if he chose not to play the 25-year-old given that Patrick Kluivert has not travelled to Greece because of a hamstring injury. </p> <p>The obvious alternative strike partner for Alan Shearer would be Shola Ameobi, who replaced Bellamy at The Valley but whose fitness needs to be judged after he suffered a reaction to a hip injury. Otherwise Laurent Robert could be moved in from the left wing. </p> <p>Souness acknowledges that attack is Newcastle's best form of defence. \"If you look at the players we have, we are geared to going forward and getting after teams and scoring goals,\" he said. \"We're not a team that will set our stall out and try and get a nil-nil. It's been widely acknowledged that the strongest part of our team would be our front six and we'll try and play to our strengths. </p> <p>\"I think if people score against us, so what? Our attitude is that we can score two against them and I'm very much aware that people who support our club want it to be.\" </p> <p>Souness will want maximum focus against Panionios, who finished sixth in Greece last season but have suffered three defeats in four matches. </p> <p>\"We are going into the unknown,\" he said. \"We've got videos of them and we had them watched at the weekend but what we must do is give them respect. </p> <p>\"It doesn't matter who you play. If you think it's a formality and go out there thinking it's only the Greek league and it's only a small team from the Greek league and it's only a case of us turning up, you'll end up with a red face with embarrassment because they'll be fit and organised and they'll be confident because their national team are the European champions.\" </p> <p><strong> TV: ITV1, ko 7.30pm</strong><br></p>",
  "<p>Carlo Ancelotti won the head-to-head against his former team-mate Frank Rijkaard as a first-half goal by Andriy Shevchenko gave Milan a 1-0 win over Barcelona and left the Italian champions with a maximum haul of nine points from their three Group C fixtures. </p> <p>Shevchenko rose at the back post on the half-hour mark to power in a Cafu cross and claim the points for Milan but in a match full of attacking football the Catalans were unlucky to come away with nothing for their efforts.</p> <p>Rijkaard had a warm welcome from the 76,000 crowd on his return to the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium, scene of some of his finest moments as a player. The 42-year-old Dutchman, who won two Serie A titles and two European Cups with the Rossoneri between 1988 and 1993, said: \"It is obvious that when you create chances you have to take them but I was very pleased with the team's performance.</p> <p>\"We haven't to get worried after this because we played well and we need to remember we were playing away to Milan, who are a pretty strong side.\"</p> <p>Ancelotti said his team had only really lost their grip in the final 20 minutes. \"Until then we were fairly in control,\" he said. \"I was satisfied with everything tonight. We could have got a second goal with a bit more lucidity.\"</p> <p>Milan came close to scoring after only 12 minutes when Shevchenko forced V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s to make a fine save after a brilliant defence-splitting pass by Kaka.</p> <p>The visitors, however, went even closer when Henrik Larsson hit the bar after a smart pass by Deco, who found the Swedish striker unmarked just in front of the Milan goalkeeper Nelson Dida.</p> <p>Immediately after half-time Filippo Inzaghi had a good chance to double the score but Vald\u00e9s was quick to rush out and block from close range.</p> <p>From then on it was Barcelona who dominated. In the 67th minute Ronaldinho forced Dida to a fine save with a dangerous low shot from outside the penalty box. Jaap Stam was a giant in Milan's defence and Deco and Juliano Belletti sent two good opportunities just wide.</p> <p>Milan sat back in the final minutes of the game but managed to resist, even if Barcelona could again feel unlucky as the substitute Andr\u00e9s Iniesta hit the bar with a powerful shot only one minute before the final whistle for what would have been a dramatic equaliser.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Internazionale ruined Claudio Ranieri's 53rd birthday as they blitzed their way to an unstoppable 5-1 win over his Valencia team in Group G. Quickfire goals from the midfielder Dejan Stankovic and the striker Christian Vieri broke the deadlock in the space of two minutes at the start of the second half. Valencia pulled one back through Pablo Aimar but Andy van der Meyde, Adriano and Julio Cruz completed the rout.</p>",
  "<p>Tim Henman showed few signs of ring-rustiness as he opened his campaign yesterday in the Masters Series event with a comfortable 6-4, 6-2 win over Spain's Albert Costa in his first match for 24 days. </p> <p>\"There was a slight concern that I hadn't played matches for some time,\" Henman admitted after his second-round victory. </p> <p>\"Davis Cup on clay was a different type of tennis,\" he said in reference to Great Britain's tie in Austria last month. \"So in some respects it was like my first real match since New York [on September 11]. But when you get the start I did, it settles you down quicker. I played some good tennis.\" </p> <p>Henman, top seed, moved into 5-1 lead before Costa staged a first-set recovery but overall the British No1's objective of winning his first match in three attempts at the Rockadrome was eased by his clearly fretful opponent. </p> <p>Costa, a one-time French Open champion and once a highly resilient player able to trade seemingly endless ground strokes, saw passes and service returns flying all over the place in the high altitude. His last two shots of the match betrayed his frustration. </p> <p>The Spanish crowd were irritated that the man who helped their country win the 2000 Davis Cup gave them little to cheer, and took advantage of a doubtful line decision a couple of points before the end to indulge in some therapeutically long whistles of complaint. </p> <p>During the periods when Costa did hang in, during a run from 5-1 down to 5-4 in the first set and in a rollercoaster penultimate game, Henman discovered a way to counter that resurgence and find a little humour too. </p> <p>When a forehand was thundered straight at him Henman sheltered below the net, afterwards peering through it as though playing with his two-year-old daughter. </p> <p>This is a more relaxed Henman. He was helped by not needing to quell an overbearing crowd after some fortunate scheduling brought a lunchtime start in a half-empty stadium. </p> <p>Henman served well, with 12 aces and a high first-service percentage, albeit in conditions greatly favouring serve. He also got to the net well, choosing the right moments to come forward. He also hit some good ground strokes in conditions making them difficult to control. </p> <p>What remains a concern is that after putting his opponent in trouble - 5-1 down in the first set - Henman did not sit on him. He allowed Costa to recover all the way to within one point of 5-5, before halting the slide with an immaculate first serve on to a sideline which set up a solid volley into an open court. Henman's next opponent is the big-serving Croatian Ivan Ljubicic. </p> <p>Manuel Santana, the tournament director, says he will continue employing models as ball girls at the event this week and rejected allegations of sexism and discrimination by a Spanish minister yesterday. </p> <p>Soledad Murillo, secretary for political equality, had asked Santana to remove the models, claiming they \"were appearing with the simple intention of being decorative and diverting.\" </p> <p>But it is not only Santana who is employing the models but also Hugo Boss, the international fashion house, whose name is displayed prominently on their vests. \"It is a misunderstanding,\" said Santana, who added that the models were being used only for one match a day.</p>",
  "<p>Thilan Samaraweera came to Sri Lanka's rescue on the opening day of the first Test against Pakistan in Faisalabad, overcoming cramp to make an unbeaten 97. </p> <p>Sri Lanka finished on 233 for seven after Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami's opening burst had reduced them to nine for three. </p> <p>Marvan Atapattu had chosen to bat on a wicket with a touch of green in it and almost immediately had cause for regret. Shoaib pinned him lbw with the third ball of the day. </p> <p>Shoaib had Kumar Sangakkara caught at slip for two in his next over and then Sami had Mahela Jayawardene caught behind for a duck. </p> <p>Samaraweera and Sanath Jayasuriya survived until after lunch, putting on 68 largely painful runs. Jayasuriya, playing his 93rd Test to equal the Sri Lankan record held jointly by Arjuna Ranatunga and Aravinda de Silva, was dropped twice before he lost patience, slashed at a ball from Sami and saw Asim Kamal hold on to a juggled catch in the covers. </p> <p>Runs flowed more freely in the last session but batting was never easy for Samaraweera, who called for a runner after suffering leg cramps. Sami finished with three for 66, Shoaib with three for 55. </p> <p>James Franklin became only the second Kiwi to claim a Test hat-trick as New Zealand took control of their opening Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka. </p> <p>The hosts began the second day on 165 for six but collapsed to 177 all out in eight overs. Franklin, a 23-year-old left-arm seamer, removed Manjural Islam Rana, Mohammad Rafique and Tapash Baisya in successive balls to match Peter Petherick's feat against Pakistan in 1976. </p> <p>New Zealand had the lead before the end of the day, finishing on 207 for five. Mathew Sinclair made 76; Jacob Oram scratched an unbeaten 18 off 105 balls. Scott Styris lasted only seven balls on the day Middlesex announced they had signed him for next season. </p> <p>The Zimbabwe rebels' last remaining hopes of reaching an accommodation with their governing body lie with the international union of cricketers. \"We've come to the end of our line,\" Stuart Carlisle said yesterday. \"The best thing to do is to hand it over to Fica and let them and the ICC deal with it.\" </p> <p>Richard Bevan, representing the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations, met the rebels and then the Zimbabwe board's president Peter Chingoka yesterday. </p> <p>Brad Hodge, the Australian who scored 1,548 runs at 61.92 for Leicestershire last season, has joined Lancashire. He will be their second overseas player alongside Muttiah Muralitharan, because Stuart Law will have UK citizenship.</p>",
  "<p>The Daily Mail columnist and interviewer Lynda Lee-Potter, who has died aged 69 after suffering from a brain tumour, was Femail personified. Righteous, infuriating and readable in equal measure, she preached the values of her newspaper. She was both proud of being working-class and triumphant for having risen out of it. What is snobbery but the entrepreneurial spirit? Class difference, she believed, will, and should, live forever - for without them, we would lack social aspiration. </p> <p>Like the Mail, she struggled to cope with social change over the past three decades. There was little left on which to pour scorn except furtive adultery, arrogance (especially when manifested by New Labour's elitist hierarchy) and \"the scrounging classes\" who languish on social security. </p> <p>Her own aspiration, fortified with a catchy double-barrelled name, propelled her to the top of Fleet Street. Born Lynda Higginson into a mining family in Leigh, Lancashire, she was a young drama school graduate when she married the son of Air Marshal Sir Patrick Lee Potter. Such a double-barrelled name, without a hyphen, would have been much smarter, as she conceded in her highly autobiographical book Class Act: How To Beat The British Class System (2000). Her own byline carried the embarrassing punctuation mark only because it had been inserted accidentally on the birth certificate of her husband Jeremy. </p> <p>In Class Act, she proudly described her humble origins. The washing hung on a line before the fire, milk collected in jugs from a van in the street and the outside lavatory with cut-up squares of the News Chronicle on a peg for toilet paper. Her grandfather \"worked down the pit all his life\" and drank too much, but taught her to respect everybody, and that she was \"as good as the Queen\". </p> <p>Fortunately, only the first year of her own existence was spent in her grandfather's terraced house; her father had a painting and decorating business, and the family moved to a new council house on the other side of town. Lee-Potter ascribed her success to winning a place at the town's grammar school and to help from a mother who, \"like me\", had a \"fundamentally ruthless streak\". This maternal ruthlessness extended to slipping a sedative into grandfather's tea so that he would not embarrass the Higginsons at the posh wedding where, in 1957, Lynda married up into a family where the furniture and the silver were inherited. </p> <p>It was not a smooth transition: helping her new mother-in-law to prepare lunch, she offered to put the beetroot in vinegar. \"In vinegar?\" cried the scandalised matron. A change of accent helped too: she claimed to have lost her Lancashire accent on the train to London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama. \"The pronunciation of upper-class names is a minefield,\" she announced from on high. As for equality: \"The only people who hanker after a classless society are those who want what other people have without working for it.\" </p> <p>When her haematologist husband - later to enjoy a high media profile himself as chairman of the British Medical Association during the Conservative NHS reforms of the early 1990s - took an RAF posting in Aden, she started writing for the Aden Chronicle. On their return to London, she became a feature writer for the Daily Mail in 1967, and wrote her column from 1972 until last May. </p> <p>As anachronistic as her social values was her fear of revealing her age. And if she had any advice to offer on the Mail's perennial question - can a married woman both work and raise a family? - from her own experience of a long, happy marriage and the successful delivery of two daughters and a son to the journalist's trade, she chose to keep it to herself. </p> <p><strong>Roy Greenslade writes:</strong> Lynda Lee-Potter loved being a journalist. For her, working on a newspaper was never simply a job, but - as she often said - a privilege. Despite her long career and her fame as a columnist, she retained the kind of youthful enthusiasm that few, if any, veteran hacks could match. </p> <p>She became the Mail's star columnist after Jean Rook went to the Daily Express, and managed to surpass her. Lee-Potter was never able to match Rook's clever wordplay, but she became the most widely read of female columnists because she had a coherent outlook on the world that she was able to get across to her many thousands of avid readers in a clear and concise manner. </p> <p>Though the Private Eye \"Glenda Slagg\" parody suggests that women columnists write top-of-the-head pieces without a semblance of belief, Lee-Potter rose above such hack writing because she had a consistent viewpoint. She upset many liberals, but her copy was convincing because she wrote from the heart. Her candour often led to accusations that she was bitchy, but she dismissed such criticism by saying, with her trade mark wide smile: \"I just write what I think.\" </p> <p>She could wound, but she never did so without cause. No one has ever been able to emulate the woman who was, deservedly, regarded as the doyenne of her trade. </p> <p>She did indeed see journalism as a trade: she laboured at the task, enjoying a long career because, until her very last column, she went on trying. She is irreplaceable. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lynda Lee-Potter, journalist, born May 2 1935; died October 20 2004</p>"
