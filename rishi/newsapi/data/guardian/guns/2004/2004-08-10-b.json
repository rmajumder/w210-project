  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong>A German International Olympic Committee member called on the IOC's athletes' commission to check competitors' T-shirts after spotting one with a reference to a Nazi war tactic. </p> <p>\"I saw an athlete in the Olympic village wearing a T-shirt that said \"Blitzkrieg - it's only a game,\" an angry Walther Troeger told an IOC meeting. </p> <p>\"They should do something about it. We should stop such a thing in the Olympic village,\" Troeger told the former pole vault champion Sergei Bubka, who heads the athletes' commission. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>In a show of reconciliation, the South and North Korean Olympic teams will march together at Friday's opening ceremony. They will enter the stadium under the same flag - a blue image of the Korean Peninsula on a white background - and to the tune of the Korean folk song Arirang. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Timo Lumme has been appointed as the IOC's marketing director. The 43-year-old Finn will leave his position as vice-president of the international cable and satellite sports network ESPN and begin his new job in November. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>France's long jump world champion Eunice Barber is hampered by thigh problems and will meet French team officials today to decide if she will be able to compete. The Sierra Leone-born athlete, who was also heptathlon silver medallist at the world championships in Paris last year, has been affected by thigh and groin problems since the beginning of July. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Jennifer Capriati withdrew from the games yesterday. She won the tennis gold medal in Barcelona in 1992 at the age of 16. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>The International Olympic Committee has barred the 48-year-old Greek javelin thrower Sofia Sakorafa from the Palestinian team, citing procedural problems. Sakorafa showed off her Palestinian passport - signed by Yasser Arafat- at a press conference in Athens yesterday. \"The invocation of a procedural discrepancy is due either to ignorance or expediency,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Geraint Jones, England's new batsman-wicketkeeper, was taught a modern-day lesson yesterday by a middle-aged English eccentric with a battered sunhat, droopy moustache and unquenchable thirst for tea. </p> <p>Jack Russell, England's finest wicketkeeper since the treasured epoch of Alan Knott and Bob Taylor, has been brought in by England's coach Duncan Fletcher to burnish Jones's flawed glovework so that it will be as accomplished as his skills in front of the wicket. </p> <p>The old fusspot has been employed to create a wicketkeeper in the modern idiom. For the ancient rubric that the stumper should be as inconspicuous as possible, some diminutive gofer who is bossed about by aristocratic captains and snarling fast bowlers, is gone for ever. </p> <p>England's Hubert Strudwick and Australia's Bert Oldfield were once hailed as their countries' finest keepers but the sad truth for the sentimentalist is they wouldn't get a game today - nor would that fondly recalled artist Bob Taylor. </p> <p>\"Duncan wanted someone from the modern game and as I've just retired I was as modern as he could get,\" said Russell. \"My game changed in the last four of five years so I was more aggressive, more the focal point of the fielding team and more prepared to stand up to the medium-pacers and quicks in one-day cricket, and the mindset that goes with it.\" </p> <p>Russell was called in before the third Test, which begins here tomorrow, and will have further sessions with Jones in preparation for the NatWest Challenge and Champions Trophy matches next month. </p> <p>\"I'm still getting to know Geraint but I know this kid's going to be a good player. This kid's got a lot of talent. And what impresses me is that he wants to push on. </p> <p>\"He's at me all the time for more information. It's music. Chris [Read] is good too. I worked with them both briefly last winter. But Geraint is easier to work with because he is so keen to get better.\" </p> <p>Russell is helping Jones just as he, when a gloved tyro, was helped by the now reclusive Knott. \"Knotty was always there when I wanted him and I will always be there for Geraint, but that's really up to him and Duncan,\" Russell said. \"We talked general stuff today, but in particular worked on standing up to Ashley Giles. </p> <p>\"When I started a lot of players would talk cricket in the pub. But Knotty didn't drink and took ages getting changed. I used to knock on the dressing room door at 9.30 and then we'd talk into the night.\" </p> <p>Jones was already some way to being a thoroughly modern keeper before he met Russell. His batting, especially his cutting and pulling, owes much to his Australian background, as does his competitive attitude. </p> <p>\"I just want to pick Jack's brains,\" he said last night. \"As a keeper he's one of the best there ever was. He's a very busy man but he's great to have around.\" </p> <p>As a batsman Jones holds an average in the 40s, which is what the specialists aspire to. But though he has missed few chances his keeping has been maladroit - especially when placed alongside the polished Read's handiwork. </p> <p>\"I want to be picked for England because I am the best keeper as well as the best bat,\" he said yesterday. \"I want to excel. The runs have helped but I'm conscious that my keeping is always being scrutinised. </p> <p>\"I'm aware that there is this huge tradition of having fantastic glovemen in this country and I don't want to go down as the bloke who wasn't one. I think I've got the foundations. I just want some of the cream. </p> <p>\"Jack was also a very aggressive keeper. When it came to putting pressure on batsmen he was the best. I want to get a bit of that into my keeping.\" </p> <p>Alec Stewart, the England keeper who retired a year ago, is another admirer of Jones. And he knew a thing or two about scoring runs and getting up batsmen's noses as a keeper. He also improved immeasurably behind the stumps. </p> <p>\"I think Geraint has the potential to be as good as Adam Gilchrist,\" he said last night. \"You can turn an ordinary keeper into a very good one but you can't turn an ordinary batsman into a top-quality one.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> England released Gareth Batty from their squad last night, enabling the off-spinner to play for Worcestershire in today's County Championship match against Northamptonshire at Worcester.</p>",
  "The annual prime ministerial holiday is one of those British rituals whose carefree appearance belies its calculation. Whether it's Baldwin motoring with his chauffeur down to the south of France in the 30s, Harold Wilson paddling in various rockpools in the Scilly Isles in the 60s or, now, Mr and Mrs Blair powering their way from the Caribbean to the Mediterranean, the holiday is part of the leader's portfolio of duties. It is crafted for the public eye and the camera lens, and the location is an index both of the prime ministerial character and grasp of the times in which we live. This is the politics of pleasure. <p>Baldwin, the West Midlands ironmaster, affected aristocratic indolence because he thought it played well with Tory voters. And so he spent his long weeks away pottering around Aix and Pau. Wilson, for his part, cultivated the aura of a suburban and nonconformist rectitude that guided him to that bungalow by the sea. Much of the charm of the view from the Scillies was that it reproached, by insinuation, the flashy bohemianism of leadership rivals such as Roy Jenkins and Tony Crosland. As far as Harold and Mary were concerned, the Hamptons could wait. </p> <p>What, then, are we to make of the Blairs' conscious, repeated, decision to glory in the fact that patronage, where prime ministers are concerned, can run in two directions? Those who dish the favours out can also be their gleeful and smirkingrecipients when it's August and time to pack the bags. Here we have a couple whose combined annual salary is at least \u00a3400,000 and who are presumably quite capable of making their own holiday arrangements. But right from the beginning in 1997 they have shown an amazing readiness to accept opulent hospitality as their right - as a legitimate fruit of office and the tribute paid by courtiers to a prince on his summer progress. The emperor Tiberius lounging in his villa at Capri could have taken lessons from these two when it comes to quality time. </p> <p> Time and again Mr and Mrs Blair show a startling disregard for propriety and, sometimes, decency. Does the sun derange their moral instincts? No previous prime minister has behaved in this way. Attlee spent August sucking on a pipe in Pembrokeshire. Thatcher's rather grim few days in Switzerland showed a native puritanism at work - as well as her view of the rest of Europe. Heath holidayed on his own boat. Macmillan did his August shoot on the grouse moor. And the Majors once stayed with the British ambassador in Portugal. The Blairs' summer spectacle dwarfs all their predecessors. </p> <p>The show started in Geoffrey Robinson's Tuscan villa in the late 90s, but has now evolved. The point about being prime minister is that you can easily find another host when the times change. And so in 2003 our heroes arrive in Egypt as guests of a dictatorial government that locks up and tortures its dissidents - something that might have given Cherie Blair, so eminently qualified in human rights legislation, reason to pause. This year the Blairs have chosen to accept Cliff Richard's hospitality in Barbados, which is at least tacky rather than offensive. But now they are on their way to Italy and Silvio Berlusconi's villa - where a whole landscape has been excavated in order to provide an arena in which Pavarotti will serenade them with that past-it voice of his. And all of this as guests of a man who drowns out, through multiple media ownership, the voices of social democratic dissent to Forza Italia and its special brand of \"post-fascism\". Breakfast with Berlusconi is a holiday from ethics - not just from Downing Street. </p> <p>The Blairs are happy to announce that a sum equivalent to their holiday expenses will go to charity. Nor are they, in themselves, exactly vulgar. But their holidays do show a ready tolerance of moral coarseness as well as an easy accommodation with the conventions of plutocratic power. They behave like this not just because they know they can get away with it. These holidays don't just happen because the Blairite party is a broken-backed institution incapable of reforming its leader. This display is calculated, and the headlines back home do no harm at all since the cult of leadership is now self-justifying. </p> <p>The two-fingered gesture to the proprieties is a good preparation for the third-term victory since the leader is now defined by his brazen break with convention. All the yachts and gold taps that go with the display of power on holiday are perfectly compatible with Mr Blair's sense of his own goodwill at whose gorgeous sight even crooked plutocrats must bend a knee. This is the politician as celebrity, postmodern to some and postideological to others, but always a degenerate sight.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:taliesin.hywel@virgin.net\">taliesin.hywel@virgin.net</a></p>",

  "Alfred Jowett, who has died at the age of 90, was a remarkable man, and an unconventional dean. In later years, in beret and coat, the Anglican dignitary could have passed for a French cur\u00e9. Yet his life before he went to Manchester provided a natural preparation for a post at a great urban cathedral. <p>His period of office, from 1964 to 1983, was one of advance, in drawing the city into the cathedral, and in the adornment of the building itself. Alfred and a very able chapter made it a place where intellectual engagement, ecumenical and international relations, and the arts all flourished. </p> <p>Alfred was a natural teacher. His classes for the Workers' Educational Association or the extramural department of the university, exploring the relationship between belief and literature, were always popular. His development of the twinning with the basilica of Saint Sernin in Toulouse was a fine instance of his entrepreneurial brilliance: he would tell how he met a group of visiting French people, of their ignorance of the Church of England, and of his almost instant resolve to do something - something educational, of course. The heart of the arrangement was parallel study groups and joint residential meetings, whether in England or in France. (Alfred, a deep lover of all things French, liked them to be in France.) </p> <p>Manchester cathedral had lost all its glass during the second world war. But, with the collaboration of Alfred's former pupil, the late Tony Hollaway, the glazing of all five of the windows of the west wall, started in Alfred's time, has been completed, and an element of glowing colour, rich with symbolism, has been introduced into the rather severe nave. At the completion of the central window, of which the theme was Mary, one of the cathedral's three patron saints, Alfred was keen that there should be reflection and teaching, and a short programme of visiting lecturers was arranged. In other areas of the arts, the cathedral was host to the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, conducted by Sir John Barbirolli, to the writers Margaret Drabble and Arnold Wesker, and, until its permanent home was completed, to the Royal Exchange Theatre. </p> <p>At the heart of all of this was the regular round of worship. Alfred's ability as a preacher attracted serious-minded people to the congregation. He was, in his own phrase, a \"manuscript preacher\", and many notebook volumes of his texts survive. There were no verbal fireworks; he did not play on the emotions. In the pulpit as elsewhere, he was a teacher, putting to use his literary knowledge and interest in Jung - those who heard a remarkable interpretation of \"the woman clothed with the sun\" (Revelation, chapter 12) will not forget it. He was keen, too, that worship should express his beliefs. At the Sunday eucharist, everyday bread, not the more common unleavened wafers, was used. \"I value anything that emphasises the reality of the incarnation,\" he said. </p> <p>The cathedral building did not circumscribe his interests. \"You can sit in here all day,\" he would say, \"but it won't get people in.\" Alfred set out to know the town hall, to know which department, which officer, to go to. He served on the education committee, and was active also in community relations, his local work leading to a national role: he was a member (from 1968), and then deputy chairman (1972-77), of the Community Relations Commission, for which in 1972 he was awarded the CBE. </p> <p>Born in Sheffield, he was the son of a pawnbroker and a mother who loved literature. Alfred developed this inheritance at the city's Central secondary (now High Storrs) school, and it flowered at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read English; it seemed set to become his life's work when he returned to Sheffield in 1936 to teach English at Ecclesfield gram mar school, followed by a post at Poole, Dorset. </p> <p>However, the second world war brought an end to this career, since, in 1940, Alfred was sent to work on the land. A conscientious objector, he held deep-rooted socialist and pacifist beliefs: his father was a socialist, and at Cambridge, he once told me, anyone who \"thought\" in the 1930s was of the left. Alfred's parents were observant Anglicans, and Leslie Hunter, the dour but innovative Bishop of Sheffield, pointed Alfred towards ordination. </p> <p>This he achieved in 1945, after two years at Lincoln Theological College. After a curacy in Goole (1944-47), Alfred was drawn back to Sheffield by Hunter, to be the first secretary of its Anglican and Free Church Council, and secretary of its Marriage Guidance Council (1947-51). </p> <p>Then he was vicar of St George's, Sheffield, an ideal parish for him. It was close to the university, where he was a part-time lecturer in education, and his preaching made the church attractive to senior and junior members; it was also a working-class area, and St Stephen Netherthorpe, bombed during the war, became an early instance of the adaptation of a church building to varied uses. </p> <p>In 1960, Alfred became vicar of the great parish church at Doncaster, where he worked hard on links with both the National Coal Board and the race course, and established a Samaritans group. After just four years, he was appointed Dean of Manchester. </p> <p>Beneath the surface, Alfred was capable of anxieties, and of self-probing. To others, however, he was avuncular and cheerful. His conversation, like his sermons, was salted with literary allusions; he had anecdotes for most occasions; he enjoyed argument. Convivial occasions with friends, and good food and drink delighted him. </p> <p>His wife Margaret, whom he married in 1939, had her own spheres of activity, in addition to being an excellent cook: the teaching of history; political activity in Sheffield and Doncaster; the Family Service Unit and the magistracy in Manchester. Her rationalist background made her ever a questioner, and Alfred's sympathy with those on, or beyond, the frontiers of faith was at least in part a response to this. </p> <p>Their last party was at the end of May, celebrating his 90th birthday, her 95th, and their 65 years of marriage. The invitation bore his typical proviso, \"if we're spared\", though his death came days before the last of the three anniversaries. </p> <p>Margaret survives him, as do their children Rosalind, Nicholas, who has followed him into holy orders, Sonya and Celia. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Alfred Jowett, priest and teacher, born May 29 1914; died July 28 2004</p>",
  "The severely corroded cooling pipe which caused Monday's fatal accident at a power station in Japan had not been properly inspected for 28 years, despite warnings that it posed a safety threat, it emerged yesterday. <p>Four workers died and seven others were injured when the pipe, carrying super-heated water, sprung a leak, sending scalding hot steam into a turbine building of the number three reactor at Mihama nuclear power plant on the Japan Sea coast. </p> <p>The admission by the plant's operator, Kansai Electric Power, came as pressure was put on the government to improve safety in an industry hit by a series of accidents and attempted cover-ups in the past several years. </p> <p>Sections of the pipe had been inspected in 1996, but a Kansai Electric official said a maintenance subcontractor had looked at it in April 2003 and said it was in need of a thorough inspection. The check was put off until this coming Saturday. \"We thought we could delay the checks until this month,\" the plant's deputy manager, Akira Kokado, told reporters. \"We never expected such rapid corrosion.\" </p> <p>He admitted that an ultrasound inspection would probably have uncovered the extent of the corrosion. The thickness of the pipe wall had shrunk from 10mm when it was installed in 1976 to 1.5mm at the time of the accident, he said. </p> <p>The local police, who are investigating Kansai Electric on suspicion of negligence resulting in death, believe the 11 affected workers were part of a group of 200 hired specifically to prepare the plant for this weekend's inspections. </p> <p>The four dead - named yesterday as Hiroya Takatori, 26, Kazutoshi Nakagawa, 41, Tomoki Iseki, 30, and Eiji Taoka, 46 - suffered severe burns and heart and lung damage. </p> <p>\"The ones who died had stark white faces,\" said Yoshihiro Sugiura, a doctor who treated them at the nearby Tsuruga city hospital. \"This shows that they had been rapidly exposed to heat.\" </p> <p>No radioactive material was involved in the accident, however, and there was no order for the 11,500 residents of Mihama to be evacuated. </p> <p>The government said it expected Kansai Electric to carry out a thorough inquiry into the accident and to release its findings in full. </p> <p>But the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, said the accident should not be allowed to jeopardise the future of Japan's nuclear power industry. </p> <p>The accident, the worst since two workers died at a uranium reprocessing plant in September 1999, has raised doubts about the safety of Japan's 52 nuclear power plants, many of which were built more than 30 years ago. The country relies on nuclear power for 34% of its energy.</p>",
  "Nottinghamshire police are helping colleagues in Lincolnshire track down the killer of the couple shot dead in the bungalow at Trusthorpe. <p>But they are also investigating two other murders that occurred within five miles and 10 days of each other. </p> <p>Terry Rodgers disappeared after his daughter Chanel Taylor, a hairdresser, was shot in the head at her home in Huthwaite, Nottinghamshire. Detectives described him as their prime suspect. </p> <p>Mrs Taylor's body was found by her husband of seven weeks, Lee, on July 30. Mr Rodgers, who had lived rough after moving out of the house in Derbyshire he had shared for 30 years with his wife Anne, had recently moved in with his daughter and son-in-law. </p> <p>According to friends, he had tried to commit suicide after the separation and had also been in financial difficulties. </p> <p>Last week a shotgun was found at the small terraced house by forensic teams after an intensive search of the murder scene. </p> <p>Detectives said it had not been \"clearly visible\" in the house. Tests to discover whether it was the murder weapon are continuing. </p> <p>Mr Rodgers was last seen in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. His car was found abandoned nearby. His son and sister have pleaded with him to give himself up. </p> <p>Police have issued 500 posters in an attempt to trace him but have warned the public not to approach him. </p> <p>Nottinghamshire detectives are also hunting Robert Boyer, who is their prime suspect in the killing of Keith Frogson, 62, who was attacked on July 19 following what may have been row over the 1984 miners' strike. </p> <p>Police are investigating claims that there was a long-running feud between Mr Boyer, who, like many in the county, joined the breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers, and Mr Frogson, who remained loyal to the National Union of Mineworkers, led by Arthur Scargill. </p> <p>Mr Frogson, who continued to shout \"scab!\" at ex-UDM members on the street, was found dead on his doorstep in Annesley Woodhouse, after an evening at a pub. </p> <p>Mr Boyer, 42, is thought to be hiding in nearby woodland; police have received reports of him looking dirty and unkempt. </p> <p>One theory is that the 20th anniversary of one of the bitterest strikes in British history could have reignited differences between the men. </p> <p>A postmortem examination found that more than one sharp instrument was used in the attack; police believe a crossbow found near the scene could have been the murder weapon. </p> <p>Ten days after his death, there was a fire at Mr Frogson's house. A possible link to the killing is being investigated.</p>",
  "<p>Buy Wm Morrison and get a Safeway almost free. That was the central thrust of a rare, bullish research note on the Bradford-based supermarket chain yesterday. </p> <p>Since issuing a nasty profits warning in July Morrisons shares have been shunned by the City and on Monday sank to their lowest level since March 2003 after a disgruntled investor dumped 23m shares. </p> <p>However, at that level blue chip broker Cazenove reckons the market is ascribing almost no value to the 7m sq ft of Safeway trading space that Morrisons acquired this year. </p> <p>This is despite the fact that the Safeway sites will generate around \u00a36bn of sales this year. </p> <p>\"A simplistic sum-of-the parts analysis suggests the legacy Morrisons business is worth around 161p of the current share price, the remaining 11p for Safeway clearly represents extraordinary value,\" analyst Mike Tattersall said. </p> <p>He also believes that July's warning was a one off and says it is highly likely that Morrisons will confirm, alongside its half-year figures in October, that it has Safeway's accounts under control and that the converted stores are trading well. </p> <p>Morrisons added 1.25p to 172.5p.</p>",
  "<p>America's central bank last night shrugged off the impact of rising oil prices on a slowing economy when it raised interest rates for the second time in six weeks to keep inflation in check. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve announced it was raising its federal funds rate from 1.25% to 1.5% following a similar move at the end of June. It blamed dearer energy prices for signs of weaker growth but sought to reassure a jittery Wall Street that further increases would come at a \"measured\" pace. </p> <p>The unanimous decision by the Fed's open market committee came on the day that New York oil futures briefly broke through $45 a barrel before falling back on news that Iraq was restarting production from its southern fields after Monday's sabotage threats. </p> <p>Crude prices edged slightly lower on both sides of the Atlantic, but dealers remained convinced that the market would test the $50 a barrel level in the near future. </p> <p>\"The prospect of a cessation of Iraqi exports from the country's southern ports for a prolonged period would almost certainly be enough to push oil prices above $50 a barrel since there is not enough spare capacity to cover the 1.7m-1.9m bpd [barrels per day] of oil exported from Basra,\" analysts at Barclays Capital said. </p> <p>US light crude touched $45.04 a barrel, a record in the 21-year history of crude futures trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before the news of restored Iraqi supplies sent prices down 32 cents on the day to $44.52. London Brent crude was down 28 cents at $41.28. </p> <p>\"The world has one of the smallest cushions ever for absorbing a loss of supply while demand growth is the stron gest in a generation,\" said Daniel Yergin, chairman of US consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates. \"These conditions mean the world oil market is even tighter than in the 1973 oil crisis.\" </p> <p>In a statement explaining its decision, the Fed said that even after raising interest rates from their 40-year-low of 1%, monetary policy was still loose enough to be helping the US economy to grow. </p> <p>In recent months, output growth had moderated and job creation slowed, probably owing to the rise in energy prices. \"The economy nevertheless appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion. Inflation has been somewhat elevated this year, though a portion of the rise in prices seems to reflect transitory factors.\" </p> <p>The FOMC put the upside and downside risks to growth and inflation over the next few quarters on an equal footing, and made it clear that a rapid increase in interest rates was not in prospect. With underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low, the committee believes policy accommodation can be removed at a measured pace. </p> <p>The Fed's optimism over future growth appeared to cheer investors. Although shares initally dipped on the news they then continued their upward march during the day and the Dow Jones closed up 130 points at 9944. </p> <p>However, analysts were wary of reading too much into the rise. \"The Fed did what it was expected to do. But in the long term, in light of the economic weakness, this bounce we're seeing in stocks is really not meaningful,\" said Hans Olsen at Bingham Legg Advisers in Boston. </p> <p>\"I think we need to look at the subsequent economic data and then to third-quarter earnings to see what kind of economy we're going to have.\"</p>",

  "The violence engulfing parts of Iraq poses \"a big threat\" to the country's economic survival and has slowed down the pace of the already faltering reconstruction effort, the finance minister in Iraq's interim government said yesterday. <p>\"The insurgents want to put hurdles and obstacles in front of every form of economic and commercial activity by Iraqis,\" Adel Abdel Mahdi said in an interview.</p> <p>\"They say they are fighting for their country but they could end up destroying it.\"</p> <p>Mr Abdel Mahdi, who is a senior member of one of the main Shia parties, the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, said that the Mahdi Army of Moqtada al-Sadr and other insurgents appeared to be waging an economic scorched earth policy in which \"they are trying to impose themselves by all means possible\".</p> <p>On Monday Iraq stopped pumping oil from its southern oil fields, which account for 90% of its oil exports, because of the unrest in the region.</p> <p>A senior official of the Southern Oil company said the pumps were stopped after a valve was blown up by saboteurs, but after quick repairs, both export lines from the fields in the Basra region were exporting again.</p> <p>\"They are serious about targeting Iraq's oil installations, trying to halt exports, which are unfortunately our lifeline,\" Mr Abdel Mahdi said.</p> <p>\"The only ones that will be hurt will be Iraqi citizens.\"</p> <p>Mr Abdel Mahdi is putting the finishing touches to next year's budget, the first by the interim government, which he said would be ready by the end of the month.</p> <p>He said that despite the regular interruption of oil exports caused by the attacks, revenues were expected to be 25% up on last year.</p> <p>\"The high price of oil has helped, and now we have reached pre-war levels of oil exports, close to two million barrels a day,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Taxation revenue has also improved, so we think the budget will be 20-25% better than last year.\"</p> <p>The priorities in the forthcoming budget would, he said, reflect \"a recognition that investment, jobs, and infrastructure\" were also key to stemming the violence.</p> <p>He urged the mostly young, unemployed men who are fighting in the name of Mr Sadr in Najaf, Baghdad and cities in southern Iraq to put down their guns.</p> <p>\"If you have an agenda or a programme, them there are peaceful means through which you can articulate it, but taking up arms will work against your ambitions and the prosperity of the country,\" he said. \"There will be money targeted at deprived regions,\" he added.</p> <p>It was also vital that Iraqis took more part in the reconstruction of their own country, he said. \"People must feel they have a stake and some control over their future. We want the foreign contractors to employ more Iraqis, and also for our friends to take our advice about the best way to spend the donors' money.\"</p> <p>It was an indirect criticism of the costly, inefficient and sometimes corrupt way that the Coalition authorities have handled the reconstruction effort. Very little of the $18.4 billion (\u00a310bn) intended for Iraq and passed by the US Congress last autumn has been spent.</p> <p>Mr Abdel Mahdi admitted that the pace of reconstruction had been affected by the vio lence, but he said that it had not stopped.</p> <p>\"Many companies have reduced their activities, but most have not given up,\" he said.</p> <p>The World Bank said that it planned to embark by October on its first reconstruction projects in Iraq since the toppling of Saddam Hussein's regime.</p> <p>It estimates that its interim reconstruction projects, which include building schools and labour-intensive irrigation schemes, will cost between $400m and $600m (\u00a3326m).</p> <p><b> Jonathan Freedland, page 23</b><br></p>",
  "Germany was under pressure last night to apologise for an episode of its largely forgotten colonial past, the massacre of up to 60,000 Africans by its troops 100 years ago today. <p>Descendants of the Herero tribe, in what is now Namibia, have demanded a formal apology for the atrocities committed under German colonial rule. </p> <p>The Herero were killed after an uprising against German settlers in the then German South West Africa. </p> <p>On August 11-12 1904 German troops shot thousands of Herero after trapping them on an arid plain. </p> <p>The massacre at Waterberg, near the Namibian capital, Windhoek, was the most infamous episode in a campaign overshadowed by Germany's even darker later history. </p> <p>Although the Social Democrat government has said it \"regretted\" the killings, it has refused to apologise, prompting a furious response by Herero descendants. </p> <p>About 200 members of the tribe have brought a case in the US for $4bn (\u00a32.17bn) compensation.</p> <p>\"We want the Germans to say 'we are sorry',\" Arnold Tjihuiko, spokesman for the Herero commemoration committee, told Der Spiegel this week. </p> <p>Germany had showed itself to be a \"master of racism\", he said, and \"lacked respect towards black people\". </p> <p>It's expression of regret was \"not adequate\", he added. </p> <p>The Herero are demanding $2bn in damages from the German government and a further $2bn from German companies which allegedly profited from the German occupation of Namibia. </p> <p>They include Deutsche Bank, the mining company Terex, formerly Orenstein-Koppel Co, and the shipping company Deutsche Afrika Linie, formerly Woermann Linie. </p> <p>The suit was condemned last week by Germany's ambassador to Namibia, Wolfgang Massing. It would \"lead us nowhere\", he said. There were other ways of healing the wounds of the past between his government and the tribe, he added. </p> <p>In an apparent sign of reconciliation, the German development minister, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, is expected to arrive in Namibia later today and will attend a commemorative ceremony at the weekend in the town of Okakarara in the Otjozondjupa region. </p> <p>Her office refused to comment on her mission yesterday, leading to speculation that she was unlikely to apologise. </p> <p>Thousands of Herero are expected to turn up at the event at the town's war memorial. </p> <p>Although Germany's colonial exploits did not match those of its principal 19th-century rivals Britain and France, it joined the scramble for Africa under Otto von Bismarck and acquired German South West Africa in 1884. </p> <p>Many Herero were relocated to make way for German farmers. In January 1904 the chief of the tribe grew furious about German raids and the loss of land and cattle. </p> <p>He ordered an attack and, over a few days, the Herero killed an estimated 150 German settlers. </p> <p>The German colonial authorities responded brutally. Charged with putting down the revolt, General Lothar von Trotha ordered his troops to \"annihilate the masses\" and German soldiers went on to kill tens of thousands of Herero. </p> <p>Their descendants describe the offensive as genocide and estimate that only 15,000 survivors escaped into the desert. </p> <p>\"They were outgunned. They didn't have modern weapons,\" said Paulette Reed-Anderson, director of the Centre for African Diaspora Research. \"By 1906 their resistance was over. Most of the chiefs had been killed. Those who did survive fled to neighbouring Botswana. It's not clear how many Herero died. This wasn't interesting to the colonisers.\" </p> <p>Germany lost control of the colony in 1915, and compensated German farmers forced to flee Africa. </p> <p>Some critics say that while Germany has been willing to atone for the Holocaust and other crimes committed under the Nazis, it has been more reluctant to apologise for its behaviour during this earlier colonial era. </p> <p>Others point out that Germans died in the conflict as well - about 1,500 German soldiers died during the uprising, most of them from disease. </p> <p>\"We want an apology and Germany should start a serious dialogue with us,\" Festus Muinjo, one of the panel examining the 1904 uprising, said last week. \"The Herero issue will not stop, it will continue ad infinitum.\" </p> <p>To break the deadlock a German law professor, Manfred Hinz, has proposed the establishment of a reconciliation commission comprising leaders of the Herero people and Germany \"to work out an appropriate form of apology and possible reparation and, hopefully, an out-of-court settlement\". </p> <p>The German government acknowledged a \"special responsibility\" for Namibia in a parliamentary resolution in 1989. </p> <p>Since then Berlin has sought to promote intensive and productive relations despite the difficult past. </p> <p>Germany is Namibia's largest donor country, and has provided aid for a number of development projects and culture programmes.</p>",
  "A few days ago, the philosopher Assa Kasher, who had just finalised the Israel Defence Force's Code of Ethics, paid me a visit on the television screen in the dentist's waiting room and explained to me, in a nutshell, how it really works. The Code of Ethics, if I understood it right, says that a soldier can exert force and, under certain circumstances, can even cause suffering if he does it to protect his own safety or the safety of the citizens of Israel. An elderly woman sitting next to me, even more bored than I was, stared at the screen and said that was very good and if she wasn't mistaken, the IDF was the only army in the world to take the trouble to \"commission\", in her words, a code like that, and not from just any hack, but from a university professor. <p>If, two weeks earlier, I hadn't gone to the Haware checkpoint, not far from Nablus, I probably would have been quick to agree with her. After all, I was brought up to agree with elderly women. But during that purely chance visit to the checkpoint, more the result of a weak character and my girlfriend's nagging than anything else, I saw a different, rival code, one that might be a little less ethical, but works like a charm. We can call it Udi's Practical Code.</p> <p>Udi was the checkpoint commander at Haware that day, and his Code was very simple - smiling people don't get through. Of course, he didn't formulate it as a Code - it worked more as intuition - but more than once I heard him and his buddies at the checkpoint exchanging intelligence information on all sorts of smilers in the queue. \"You see that guy over there, the tall one with the tie?\" I heard a soldier say to Udi, \"Do you see how he's laughing at us? Don't worry, I'll wipe that smile off his face.\" Udi nodded his agreement, and the smiler was in fact detained for more than an hour. When he tried to show them the permit that would justify his smile - he was just a man on his way to his own wedding - it was already too late. A happy father who had bought his three-year-old son a birthday cake imprinted with a picture of the child had also violated the code and was detained. The official reason - he didn't wait in line like everyone else.</p> <p>When I tried to explain that the people in the queue had let the father get ahead of them because the cream cake would spoil if he waited in the heat, Udi gave me a smile, and from behind the barrel of his gun, which was pointed in the general direction of my chest, explained that he didn't give a shit. Not a very surprising statement considering that an hour earlier he had been just as stingy with his shit when he ignored the distress of a 70-year-old man who had been discharged from the hospital that day after heart surgery and was finding it difficult to stand in the hot sun for such a long time.</p> <p>There are a lot more clauses in Udi's Practical Code. When a Palestinian student tried to explain to him in English something about a permit he had in his hand, Udi clarified, \"This is Israel, so you either speak Hebrew or you shut your mouth.\" The student immediately recognised the Code he had come up against, and because he didn't know Hebrew, he took the second option, shut his mouth, and was detained for four hours.</p> <p>Udi's Code, by the way, also has a few pointers about Hebrew-speaking Palestinians, especially the ones who argue. I saw him cock his gun, point it at the head of a Palestinian who was talking without permission, and say, \"If you don't shut your mouth, you'll get a bullet in the head.\" And the talkative Palestinian shut his mouth, too, because a Code is a Code.</p> <p>The day after the interview with Professor Kasher on the daily TV news magazine, the host on that programme talked about a soldier who had hit a Palestinian he claimed had called him a liar and then shot and wounded him while he was trying to get away. I don't know that soldier's name, but I can assure you it's not Udi. Because Udi's no idiot. And like a few other soldiers, he knows how to put his Code into effect so it doesn't conflict with the IDF Code. If you are a decent, sensitive person, the IDF won't force you to torture people unnecessarily, but if you are an asshole and you have a good enough grasp of how the system operates, you can abuse to your heart's content without exceeding accepted levels of detaining and cursing, or threatening with a cocked gun, and without getting on the TV news magazine.</p> <p>When I mentioned everything Udi had done that day to his commanding officer - the one the Palestinians called \"the good officer,\" mostly because of his thin-framed glasses and his psychotherapist tone of voice - he nodded empathetically and said that the soldiers have been under terrible pressure the past couple of days. \"But the minute I got here,\" the officer tried to see the good side, \"it all started moving like clockwork, didn't it? Almost half the ones they detained went through.\"</p> <p>I won't be going to the Haware checkpoint any more. But if one day Professor Assa Kasher gets tired of sitting at his desk and mulling over the Code of Ethics of the most moral army on the planet, I would heartily recommend that he take half a day off and visit a place where Immanuel Kant has never set foot.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Translated from Hebrew by Sondra Silverston.

  "<p>The Premier League was warned yesterday that it cannot exploit the Sven-Goran Eriksson affair to increase its power within the Football Association and gain greater control of FA finances, as fears increase among amateur representatives that they may be sidelined by the latest debate over restructuring. </p> <p>An amateur member of the FA board, who did not wish to be named, said: \"It is shaping up into a battle between the amateur game and the professional game. The FA's image has been tarnished but the truth is that an awful lot of people give up their time for free to work for the FA and they are not responsible for any of the recent problems. There is nothing wrong with amateurs being involved with the FA.\" </p> <p>An emergency meeting of the FA board will today discuss the review announced last week of the organisation's structure and management procedures amid the fallout from the former secretary Faria Alam's relationships with Eriksson and the now-resigned chief executive Mark Palios. </p> <p>Amateur representatives on the FA board and FA council are increasingly concerned that the professional game wants to take over the running of the England team and the FA Cup, the FA's two largest revenue earners. </p> <p>Their professional counterparts are calling for a root-and-branch reform of the FA, claiming its current committee structure is too bureaucratic and not suitable for the needs of the modern game. </p> <p>A member of the 70-strong council said: \"There's been a lot of criticism of the way the FA is structured, the board and the council. But the fact is, none of these people have done anything wrong. All the problems have been caused by members of FA staff. </p> <p>\"The FA council is the all-powerful body and the feeling is that it will dig its heels in because people are getting fed up by everything being blamed on the structure of the FA. The council will not give up its power to the professional game without a fight.\" </p> <p>Today's meeting will hear from the FA chairman Geoff Thompson, the Premier League chairman Dave Richards, and Roger Burden, who represents the grassroots game. </p> <p>One of the issues likely to be discussed is what shape the FA will take if the running of the England team and FA Cup is taken away and it is left to act solely as a regulatory body. </p> <p>The board will also receive an update on the search for a new chief executive.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Team news</strong> </p> <p>Liverpool leave Michael Owen out of their Champions League starting line-up as speculation over his future at Anfield heightens. The theory that he is on the brink of a move to Real Madrid is given more credence by coach Rafael Benitez's decision to name the England striker only on the bench, meaning he will not be cup-tied in European competition for the season unless he sets foot on the pitch. In other words, he's doing one. </p> <p> <strong>Preamble</strong> </p> <p>Sweet Jesus, is it that time already? Michael Owen may be off to Madrid, but sadly I'm going nowhere. So excuse me as I paraphrase the late Bill Hicks and plaster on a fake smile, crack the knuckles of each hand and get ready to plough through another long season of this tedious minute-by-minute tosh one more time. It's so nice to be here with an uplifting message ... </p> <p> <strong>1 min:</strong> AK Graz strikers Kollman and Aufhauser get proceedings underway for the home side, a team I am perfectly happy to admit I had never heard of before yesterday. Graz AK line out in red shirts with white shorts, while Liverpool are playing from left to right in their away kit of yellow, with black trim and black shorts. Excited? I know I am. </p> <p> <strong>2 mins:</strong> Liverpool's signing from Malaga, the right-back Josemi, plays his first pass of the season. It's a long ball down the right from inside his own half which is easily cut out by a Graz AK defender. Moments later, Liverpool win a free-kick a few yards outside the Graz AK penalty area, to the right. Finnan swings it in and Sami Hyypia brings a good save out of Scheuer in the Graz goal with a fine header. Corner for Liverpool. </p> <p> <strong>3 mins:</strong> Liverpool win a free-kick in an identical position. Finnan takes it again, but his delivery is poor. </p> <p> <strong>6 mins:</strong> A rash challenge by Standfest earns Liverpool a free-kick in the centre of the field. Steven Gerrard takes it quickly and nothing comes of it. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Stephen Early writes: \"C'mon Barry for crying out loud, cheer up,\" he begs. \"I'm writing up a 7,500 word essay on secularism in France and no matter how badly Liverpool play tonight, they can't be as irritating as that.\" </p> <p>Are you sure, Stephen? Are you? </p> <p> <strong>9 mins:</strong> Cisse takes delivery of a long ball from Riise and promptly loses it. Graz AK counter and win a free-kick a few yards outside the D of the Liverpool box. Kollman shoots, but his effort deflects harmlessly out of play off the Liverpool wall. </p> <p> <strong>10 mins:</strong> Why are Irish people so obsessed with getting what is known as 'the mention' in media circles? It really puzzles me. Take Patrick Falvey, for example: \"You wouldn't manage to mention a few things about Graz would you for the barstoolers amongst us who have no clue,\" he asks. \"Also - will ya try and sneak in a mention for a new ex-pat's website <a href=\"www.irishvibe.com\">www.irishvibe,com</a>?\" </p> <p>It is done. </p> <p> <strong>14 mins:</strong> Milan Baros fluffs an easy chance from about six yards after latching on to a lovely through ball from Steven Gerrard. All he had to do was slot the ball home past Scheuer in the Graz AK goal, but he got the ball caught under his feet and couldn't dig it out in time. </p> <p> <strong>16 mins:</strong> A free-kick wide on the right for Graz AK, which is swung in towards Liverpool's far post. Jerzy Dudek earns his corn by plucking it from the air. Interesting fact: Graz AK currently top the Austrian Super League and won the League and Cup double last year after going 106 years without winning the title. Mad, eh? Oh. </p> <p> <strong>18 mins:</strong> Kollman goes close for Graz AK. He robbed the ball from the toe of a dozing Steven Gerrard in midfield, went on a surging run and, upon being forced wide by Sami Hyypia, tried a shot from distance which fizzed past Jerzy Dudek's right-hand post. </p> <p> <strong>20 mins:</strong> \"For god's sake, the name of our goalkeeper is SCHRANZ, not scheuer. how did you get that name?\" writes Peter Malik from Austria, another man who's far too busy and important to bother with frivolities like capital letters or punctuation. </p> <p>I got the name \"Scheuer\" from the news wires, but as they're wrong more often than not, Peter, I'll bow to your superior knowledge and call him Schranz from now on. </p> <p> <strong>21 mins: Graz AK 0 - 1 Liverpool</strong> Schranz/Scheuer/Whoever is left clutching at thin air as a Steven Gerrard howitzer from just outside the Graz AK box flies past him and into the top left-hand corner. A beautiful strike. </p> <p> <strong>26 mins:</strong> Patrick Falvey is back and, while delighted with his mention, still wants more: \"How are both Finnan and Josemi playing - is one of them in midfield?\" Eh yes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Cisse fails to get on the end of a low, hard cross from one of his team-mates whose name I didn't quite get because I was neither listening nor looking. It should have been 2-0. I should have been paying attention. </p> <p><strong>30 mins:</strong> Baros fails to bury an easy header from close range, the by-product of a wasted headed opportunity from Cisse. </p> <p>\"If you expose yourselves against us, then we're going to score!\" says Ray Clemence on Five, when asked for his opinions on what the Liverpool players might be thinking about their opposition. Perhaps somebody should tell him they aren't in a lap dancing club. </p> <p> <strong>34 mins:</strong> Three Liverpool substitutes are warming up, but Michael Owen is not one of them. Read into that what you will, although mark my words he'll be off in the next week or two. Baz knows. Baz always knows. Even when he doesn't know. </p> <p>Meanwhile in America, the vice president of Headwater Creative writes in to tell me how lucky I am: \"Hey, I'm stuck here in a non-descript office building (not dissimilar to where you might find David Brent), in Bloomington, Minnesota, on a cold and blustery day,\" says Dave Jarzyna. \"I'd trade places with you in a heartbeat just to see some actual football (or as we Americans proudly call it, soccer). Do you have any idea where Bloomington is?\" </p> <p>No I don't, Dave, but if your company makes money I'll gladly call your bluff and swap lives with you. Do you have a nice girlfriend? House? Car? Income? </p> <p><strong>38 mins:</strong> Harry Kewell drives a low, hard cross from left to right across the Graz AK box. Cisse can't quite get in front of his marker and <em>just</em> fails to poke it home. </p> <p><strong>39 mins:</strong> Liverpool are not defending deep at all tonight and are maintaining a defensive line quite far out from goal to facilitate quick counter-attacks. This will come as a relief to fans who were tiring of Gerard Hollier's 11-bats-hanging-from-their-own-cross-bar style of attacking football. </p> <p> <strong>42 mins:</strong> \"Look, mate, we're all looking forward to this next year with you and your fellow musketeers of the minute-by-minute,\" writes David Studer. \"So please, please, drop the whining about your sorry lot, stop making mistakes about people's names and just get on with the vital job of diverting us from our responsibilities.\" </p> <p> I'd love to, David, but unfortunately whining about our sorry lot and making mistakes with people's names is just a part of what we are. </p> <p> <strong>44 mins:</strong> \"Who is playing right back, Finnan or Josemi?\" writes John O'Driscoll, with the kind of urgency that suggests he really, really <em>cares</em> about who is playing right-back for Liverpool in a Uefa Champions League third qualifying round first leg. It's Josemi, John. Finnan is on the right side of midfield. </p> <p> <strong>Half-time</strong> </p> <p> <strong>Half-time high jinx</strong> </p> <p>\"My sister Juliette is very impressed with the speed at which you are writing and following the match - she wonders what you are doing with your left hand?\" writes Duncan Kemp from Lapland. And a ho-ho-ho to you too, Duncan and Juliette. </p> <p>\"You may not be pleased to be back but if you need a pat on the back/kick up the arse - I have been using your commentaries for a pre-season masterclass to persuade my Italian crew to start expressing themselves a little in their minute by minute reports for the club websites - make of that what you will,\" harrumphs Mike Ingram. That's very flattering, Mike, if not a little scary and distrubing. </p> <p>Now would you all just stop moaning. This time last week I was sitting drinking lots of beer in the sunshine outside a bar in Amsterdam, looking at gorgeous women passing by as barges chugged up and down an adjacent canal. The most pressing concern I had was what I was going to have for my dinner and where I was going to go afterwards. Now look at me and what I'm doing - is it any wonder I'm cranky? </p> <p> <strong>Craven plea for employment:</strong> \"Tell Dave Jarzyna that I'd love to be in Bloomington and if he's willing to give this MBA a shot, I'll get a satellite system put in my home there and we can take long lunches when necessary to watch live football...er, soccer,\" writes Lee Warren. </p> <p><strong>45 mins:</strong> Liverpool get the second half underway in the Arnold Schwarzenegger Stadium. There are no changes on either side and Michael Owen has not signed for Real Madrid since last we spoke. </p> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> Liverpool win a free-kick in the corner, on the right. After much pushing and shoving in the box, Ehmann gets booked and Finnan promptly wastes the free-kick. </p> <p> <strong>48 mins:</strong> It's all getting very scrappy and niggly. It sure ain't pretty. </p> <p><strong>50 mins:</strong> After a mazy run down the left, Harry Kewell rolls the ball across the edge of the penalty area, to Milan Baros. Schranz gets down quickly to save his low, scuffed effort. </p> <p> <strong>51 mins:</strong> Gerrard gives ball away again (shades of Euro 2004, England v France, anyone?) and Kollman is released one on one against Dudek. Offside! </p> <p> <strong>53 mins:</strong> Kewell lays the ball off to Baros on the edge of the Graz AK penalty area again, but the Czech striker - who I absolutely love because his goalscoring exploits at Euro 2004 paid for my summer holidays - is bundled off the ball before he can turn and shoot. </p> <p> <strong>54 mins:</strong> \"I've been a Liverpool fan forever and personally I've always thought Owen was over rated,\" writes Michael Furlong. \"A low work rate and a one-style striker. Even if he tried harder it would be easier to forgive him. Owen leaving. So sad. Too bad. Sunny weather here in San Francisco. The East Bay Senior Soccer League kicks off in September. My team moves up a division. Life is good.\" </p> <p>At least somebody's happy. </p> <p> <strong>56 mins:</strong> Kollman goes close again, but doesn't trouble Jerzy Dudek. Liverpool are completely in control of this game, but occasional sloppiness from their midfielders mean the home side aren't out of it yet. Do you see what I'm trying to do there? Do you? I'm trying to generate excitement wherre there just isn't any to be found. Is it working? Nah, didn't think so. </p> <p> <strong>58 mins:</strong> Another Liverpool attack down the left, another ball into Baros on the edge of the Graz AK penalty area. Again, nothing comes of it. Baros is playing with his back to goal and just isn't being given room to turn. </p> <p> <strong>60 mins:</strong> A brilliant save from the agile Schranz in the Graz Ak goal, who tips a headed effort from Baros around his own post and out for a corner. Baros's effort had come from a corner swung in by Steve Finnan. Good effort, fantastic save. </p> <p> <strong>62 mins:</strong> Bazina, who is a Croatian international, replaces Skoro, who isn't.</p> <p> <strong>63 mins:</strong> \"I am a Liverpool supporter from England currently living in sunny Los Angeles, California trying to follow the match on the Guardian website and work at the same time,\" writes Alex Hill. \"It's tricky but I'm managing it - these pesky Americans wouldn't appreciate it if they knew what I was up to but luckily we don't have an IT department to check on these things. Anyway, do Baros and Cisse look like they are working well together up front?\" </p> <p>Well Alex, thank you for getting to the point eventually. To answer your question - no they don't. Baros looks a shadow of the man who swept all before him in Euro 2004, while Cisse is having what can only be described as 'a shocker'. Never mind working well together, they don't even look as if anyone's taken the trouble to introduce them to each other. </p> <p> <strong>66 mins:</strong> A brilliant 25-yard volley from Steven Gerrard fizzes past Schranz in the Graz AK goal, but his effort is ruled out by the linesman's flag. Having seen it three times now, I still have no idea why it was disallowed. Nobody was in an offside position, there were no obvious infringements and it was an absolute screamer. A very odd decision which Steven Gerrard has taken far more stoically than I would have. It's not every day you fire home a zinger like that. </p> <p> <strong>69 mins:</strong> \"Bloomington, Minnesota, is 500 miles north of Chicago near the Canada border and the proud home of the Mall of America - the biggest freaking mall in the country,\" writes Dave Jarzyna (34 mins). \"It sits on the former site of Metropolitan Stadium, which once hosted Pele, Beckenbauer and the rest of the New York Cosmos against our very own Minnesota Kicks of the North American Soccer League.\" </p> <p>Very informative, but no mention from Dave over whether Lee Warren can have a job. You have to love the Yanks though - imagine being so utterly bereft of culture that you're reduced to boasting about how big your local shopping centre is. Fantastic. </p> <p> <strong>72 mins:</strong> Liverpool substitution: Michael Owen for Milan Baros. Sorry, did I type Michael Owen? I meant to type Salif Diao. A slip of the fingers is all it was. Also, a man named Sick has replaced somebody on the Graz AK side. </p> <p> <strong>76 mins:</strong> John O'Driscoll has mailed in to tell me that elsewhere in Europe, Juventus are 2-1 down at home to Djurgarden, who I've never heard of. That's all well and good, John, but how are Sunderland getting on against Crewe in the really big match of the night?</p> <p> <strong>77 mins: Graz AK 0 - 2 Liverpool</strong> <br> Steven Gerrard settles the match with a low diagonal drive into the bottom corner from the right corner of the six yard box. His goal was teed up by Harry Kewell after excellent work down the left by Cisse. </p> <p> <strong>81 mins:</strong> \"Believe me, I'm not boasting about the Mall of America,\" counters Dave Jarzyna in an email headed 'Be nice'. Could this be the same Dave Jarzyna, incidentally, who still isn't prepared to give Lee Warren MBA a job. C'mon Dave - could you not have him making the tea or something? He sounds desperate. Perhaps he'll work for food. </p> <p>Liverpool substitution: Stephen Warnock for Steven Gerrard. </p> <p> <strong>82 mins:</strong> Liverpool substitution: Finnan off, Darren Potter on for his competitive debut for Liverpool. He looks about 12 years old and more Harry Potter than anything else.

  "<p>It sounded like the ultimate retro break - a state-subsidised stay in a government-owned log cabin, maybe with a little communal tractor-driving thrown in. Such fun prospects from the Soviet era are still available in North Korea, Cuba - and New Labour's Britain, according to a Conservative policy document on potential savings at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p> <p>Deep in the woods, three relics of socialism offer strength through joy at a \u00a33.7m loss last year, courtesy of the Forestry Commission, say the Tories. The nearest to me in Leeds is Keldy in the North York moors national park, and we were soon on the way there, knapsacks stuffed with Tizer and song sheets from revolutionary socialist student days in the 1960s. </p> <p>\"You'll be held up in Pickering by the traction engine rally,\" said Sue Cox's cheerful voice from cabin control, when my wife and I rang to check arrangements. And we were; creeping, steaming monsters (how can so much power create so little speed?) paralysed the roads for miles. Here was authentic nostalgia and Soviet-style inefficiency; we had nothing to lose but our place in the queues.</p> <p>But that was it as far as Michael Howard's nightmare of Komsomol dachas were concerned. Once you get on the road to Helmsley, brown tourist signs to \"Keldy Forest Cabins\" abound - nothing hidden or surreptitiously socialist here. So do estate cars full of the sort of cheery families you meet at Center Parcs, heading for something basically similar, though simpler. Typical. The bourgeois take over everything. </p> <p>There are no glorious names from the socialist era either - Aneurin Bevan, Barbara Castle - carved on the cabin walls. Like the other two sites, in Cornwall and Perthshire, Keldy has just been completely torn down and rebuilt, which turns out to explain the <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/news/story/0,7445,1271602,00.html\">Tories' suggestion</a> that Forest Holidays (an arm of the Forestry Commission which is about to become a public-private partnership) is mired in loss. The 141 cabins and 5,000 caravan pitches make an annual profit of about \u00a31m. The year the Tories picked on saw the budget skewed by major investment.</p> <p>Cabins like ours - whose workaday name, Number 52, was its only Soviet feature - arrived as \u00a370,000 flatpacks which were assembled among the trees this winter. \"Cabin\" is a fanciful name, too, for something Hansel and Gretel would consider a mansion. Think \"lodge\" or even \"villa\". These are Scandinavian-style chalets of the type you see at Langdale in the Lake District and other smartish time-shares. They have mod cons which some Forest Holidays veterans consider extremely pansy. Dishwashers, even. TVs and videos. </p> <p>\"Some regulars were a bit surprised,\" says Sue Cox, who runs the 62-cabin site with her husband Dave and a handful of green-shirted Forestry bods (another, very slight, uniformy nod in the direction of the Kremlin). \"They talk about the days when they were children and they had to climb a vertical ladder to get to their bunks.\" Now, the children's bedroom is up an elegant wooden flight of bannistered steps, complete with retractable stairgate.</p> <p>What do you do? This is Center Parcs without the flumes and Jacuzzi. There's ping pong, communal barbecueing and a huge emphasis on nature. See deer from your bedroom window over morning tea. Track a pheasant sauntering past your big, Californian-style deck. Tick off the birds, insects and reptiles from big recognition charts in the Children's Room. This is the sort of holiday break of which a certain type of Guardian reader dreams.</p> <p>There are also extras. Keldy has a turreted squash court, the only relic of a hideous Edwardian shooting lodge built here by the Reckitt family, chemical magnates of Hull. Ha! Their property now belongs to the people (sort-of). There's also a pretty cast-iron certainty of seeing badgers. On our one evening's stay, we had an excellent spell in the hide. I'm convinced our badger waved.</p> <p>The walks are also five-star. Not simply the chance to wander for miles in the vast loveliness of the North York Moors, but full of well-marked circuits in the dark, beguiling forests of Cropton and Dalby. Biking is even better and very much Keldy's preferred method of transport. Short-term hire is quite pricey - nothing socialist about \u00a38 a day - but there are good family and week-long deals.</p> <p>Children buzz about the whole site safely on bikes or foot, and there's quite a likelihood of meeting extended family parties - three-generation holidays are common - and wholesome groups organised by churches or the Inner Wheel. As great escapers from anything resembling a camp, Penny and I were extremely pleased to find the New Inn, Cropton, less than three miles from Keldy, whose pub micro-brewery produced Britain's champion bitter two years ago. The menu groans with such excellent things as steak and ale pie.</p> <p>No, Soviet it ain't. But Keldy has some of the simplicity of former times and, if you like camping, there's a bit of make-do feel, even to the luxury new cabins. Ours was for six, but that means two people using a sofa bed in the main, kitchen-and-sitting room. Given the current hard times at Conservative central office, I can't think of a better place for a shadow cabinet brainstorming and get-to-know-you weekend.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>Martin stayed in a six-person cabin at Keldy. Prices start at \u00a3285 per cabin for a three-night break between September 4 and October 12. A seven-night break in September starts at \u00a3495. <a href=\"http://www.forestholidays.co.uk\">forestholidays.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"mailto:info@forestholidays.co.uk\">info@forestholidays.co.uk</a>, 0131 314 6100</p>",
  "Police today described the brazen murder of a couple in broad daylight in a quiet Lincolnshire village, fuelling speculation that they were the victims of a professional revenge killing. <p>Joan and John Stirland were shot dead at their seaside bungalow in Trusthorpe on Sunday. Lincolnshire police today said witnesses had described two men in blue boiler suits running or walking to and from the house around the time of their murder. </p> <p>Witnesses also told police they had seen a dark-coloured saloon car parked near the house with its hazard lights flashing. A burning Volkswagon Passat was discovered at 3.30pm on Sunday about two miles from the murder scene. The car was taken for forensic tests, police said. They appealed for witnesses who had been in the area between 2pm and 4pm.</p> <p>The couple's bodies were discovered at 9.30pm on Sunday. Lincolnshire police said the fact that the shocking attack had taken place \"in broad daylight on a beautiful summer's afternoon\" suggested \"an element of pre-planning\". They appealed for local businesses to preserve CCTV tape from July 30 onwards to assist police in determining if the murderers or their associates had visited the area before the attack. </p> <p>Mrs Stirland, 53, was the mother of Michael O'Brien, a convicted murderer jailed for life at Nottingham crown court last month. She and her husband, John, had moved to Trusthorpe in April in an attempt to make a fresh start. </p> <p>O'Brien had shot and killed Marvyn Bradshaw, 22, outside the Sporting Chance pub in Top Valley, Nottingham. When his sentence was handed down, O'Brien threw a glass of water over the public gallery and yelled abuse at the victim's family. \"Your son looked like a doughnut, with a big hole in his head,\" O'Brien yelled at Bradshaw's family. \"I know where you live.\" </p> <p>Lincolnshire police said they were working with Nottinghamshire police to see if there was a connection with Bradshaw's murder. Mr and Mrs Stirland had not given evidence at O'Brien's trial, and were not part of a witness protection scheme, police said. </p> <p>Police were continuing their forensic and ballistic investigations, and did not yet know what type of gun had been used in the murders. Appealing for witnesses, Lincolnshire police said they \"could not rule out the possibility, however unlikely, that the killers are still on the east coast\".</p>",
  "<p>Michael Howard, the leader of the Tory party, will today highlight pupil violence in the classroom, claiming that a crackdown by a Conservative government would see heads given new powers to tackle problem children. </p> <p>Ten pupils a day are being expelled from English classrooms following an assault on a teacher, he claimed. </p> <p>Ahead of his major speech in Middlesborough today, Mr Howard's office released a dossier on violence in schools documenting a rising number of exclusions.</p> <p>It cites Office of National Statistics figures reveal there were 17,000 exclusions - temporary and permanent - in the last term of last year. Of those, 4,000 were excluded for attacks on adults. The dossier goes on to list high profile cases of violence in schools over the past three years. </p> <p>Previous government figures for last year showed that 9,290 children of secondary school age were permanently excluded, 245 fewer than the previous year and 3,000 fewer than in 1997.</p> <p>As part of a wider speech on crime and disorder Mr Howard will today link discipline problems in classrooms with anti-social behaviour elsewhere. </p> <p>\"Many people now believe they are no longer wholly responsible for their actions,\" he will say. \"It's someone else's fault, or something else's fault - the environment, society, the government.\"</p> <p>The key proposal in the Conservative policy, which is not new, is to give headteachers the last say in exclusions. </p> <p>The Labour government brought in pupil appeal panels, which allow a pupil and their families to contest an exclusion. They have come into criticism for not taking the headteacher and teachers' opinions into account, and undermining their authority. </p> <p>In September 2002 a row kicked off at Glynn technology college in Surrey where two pupils were returned despite making death threats against a teacher. The then-education secretary Estelle Morris stepped in and ordered the children out of the school.</p> <p>The panels have since been reformed so that they have to include a serving or ex-heateacher and they have to consider the needs of all children in a school, not just the excluded pupil. They have been justified as a last resort for pupils to appeal against a decision they may feel is unfair.</p> <p>Today's dossier, which also highlights the Conservative policy, promises to \"give control back to heads, teachers and governors\". </p> <p>\"We will abolish appeals panels, re-establishing the authority of heads and governors to deal with unacceptable standards of behaviour.\"</p> <p>Last year there were around 1,500 appeals - out of nearly 10,000 exclusions. One hundred and forty nine pupils were reinstated.</p>",
  "<p>Following its recent compromise deal with the independent labels behind big selling bands such as the White Stripes and the Streets, Apple's iTunes online music store today announced it has boosted the size of its available catalogue to more than 1 million tracks in the US. </p> <p>The music download service, which finally launched in Europe in June, has added more than 300,000 new tracks to the US version of the service as the battle for market share of the online music sector gains pace. </p> <p>The European version of iTunes, launched by Apple founder Steve Jobs in the UK, France and Germany in June, currently offers 700,000 tracks at 79p each, although record industry insiders say this too will soon be boosted to more than 1 million. </p> <p>Apple is battling with Napster, which was relaunched earlier this year, Sony, Microsoft and others for control of the market, kick-started in the last 12 months by the popularity of Apple's iPod player. </p> <p>The belated determination of record companies to find new ways to combat online piracy and arrest declining sales has led to more enthusiasm to license tracks to online services. </p> <p>While some notable omissions remain, including The Beatles, Apple now offers more than one million tracks in the US. </p> <p>\"The iTunes music store offers the world's most extensive collection of downloadable music with over 1 million tracks available,\" said Eddy Cue, Apple's vice president of Applications. </p> <p>\"With more than 1 million songs, over 600 independent labels and dozens of innovative features, iTunes is the ultimate destination for discovering and downloading music,\" he added. </p> <p>Record labels are watching with interest to see whether consumers prefer Napster's mixture of subscription and permanent downloads, iTunes' straightforward download service or OD2's hybrid version. </p> <p>In the US iTunes is the clear market leader with a market share of more than 70%, selling more than 100 million songs since it launched last year. </p> <p>In the UK, much depends on whether Apple's rivals can topple the iPod as the most popular digital music player. Tracks downloaded on iTunes only work with the iPod, while those downloaded using other services will work on a variety of similar devices. </p> <p>In September the British Phonographic Industry will launch the first UK national download chart, seen as a precursor to including downloads in the official top 40. Record labels hope such a move will help revive the moribund singles chart and shows such as Top of the Pops.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>The government today cancelled the publication of the results of English tests taken by every 15-year old in the country following a breakdown in the marking procedures which headteachers have described as \"haywire\".</p> <p>The unprecedented move raises questions over the publication of this year's school league tables which are due to be published in December and rely on these results.</p> <p>The Department for Education and Skills issued a statement this afternoon announcing that the results would not be published on August 24, when they were due to be unveiled along with those for maths and science. A further announcement will follow at the end of the month, but there is no planned publication date at the moment.</p> <p>What exactly went wrong with the marking of more than 600,000 English key stage three tests papers this year is still contested. What is known is that the process was being reformed to improve speed and accuracy. For the first time two markers looked at the papers, one judging reading, the other writing.</p> <p>The markers then compared marks on a website, where they could check which borderline marks needed moderating. But the markers have complained that the online service was so slow and cumbersome that it stalled their efforts to meet a deadline to get results out to schools. The markers were supplied by the exam board Assessments and Qualification Alliance, while the number-crunching website was provided by Pearson, which also owns the exam board Edexcel. </p> <p>As it became clear that the marks would not reach schools in time for the end of term deadline, the National Assessments Agency, the division of the exam watchdog the Qualification and Curriculum Authority which oversees the tests, ordered that checking of borderline marks be side-stepped.</p> <p>By July 20 it was clear that schools had not received their marks on time. The QCA issued an apology to 170 schools who had not received their results, blaming the elongated process of the new procedure. </p> <p>But headteachers were still unhappy with the quality of results. They say that the results have been \"haywire\" with cases where whole schools have been given one mark. The Secondary Heads Association insists there is an issue of quality as well as quantity. No formal inquiry into what went wrong has yet been announced.</p> <p>A pilot of a similar online marking tool for GCSE maths was abandoned earlier this year after it proved slower than the paper based version.</p>",

  "<p>MURPHY'S LAW</p> <p>He doesn't exactly possess the snarl of Mike Tyson, the physique of Primo Carnera or the left jab of Larry Holmes but, until very recently, Danny Murphy was a dressing-room heavyweight at Anfield. (Yes, really.) And so, coincidentally, was little Michael Owen (along with Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard). But by the end of the week, this cosy, \"No3 please\" Barber Shop quartet could be more broken up than Jason Statham and Kelly Brook's relationship. Because Murphy's gone - and Owen's set to follow him!</p> <p>On a day of more wheeling and dealing than a BMX-riding croupier, Liverpool sold Murphy to Charlton, had their bid for Xabi Alonso confirmed by Real Sociedad, and remained tight-lipped over the future of Owen. However at the Arnold Schwarzenegger stadium last night, Liverpool players reckoned that Owen would be saying hasta la vista (sorry) to the club. But with \u00a310m plus Fernando Morientes or, better still, Samuel Eto'o apparently being offered by Real, it looks like Rafa Benitez might just pull off the deal of the season.</p> <p>We'll know more come 7.45pm tonight, when Liverpool step onto the pitch for their Big Cup qualifier against Graz AK. If Owen's not wearing a red shirt that's an abomination compared to the classic Liverpool tops of the 1980s, then he's surely off. In the meantime Benitez will hope to complete the \u00a310.7m signing of Xabi Alonso - who has a pudding bowl haircut circa Beatles 1963, was given his debut at Real Sociedad by John Toshack and has an eye for a pass like Jamie Redknapp in his prime. Sadly for the purposes of a witty pay-off, he doesn't sport a comedy moustache. But give it time, eh? (eh? eh? etc).</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"On August 7, Cristiano Ronaldo underwent a magnetic resonances scan, not for medical reasons and nor for any specific symptoms but because the manager of Manchester United had insisted on it\" - A Portugese suit shows just how low Sir Alex Ferguson is willing to stoop in his bid to keep his man from playing in the Olympics.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>IT'S BACK! </strong></p> <p>The Fiver knows what it is to feel raw excitement: to have a lone bead of sweat drift languorously down our back; to feel the hairs on our neck stand up faster than the real Slim Shady; or to feel our spine shiver like a promiscuous teenager in a horror-movie set in Greenland. But with our local Blockbuster all out of copies of The Girl Next Door, we'll have to make do with the return of Big Cup to get our juices flowing. It's back - and John 'Autocue' Barnes is presenting!</p> <p>It kicks off tonight, when Liverpool travel to Austria to face a side who, depending on where you look, are either called 'Liebherr GAK', 'Grazer AK' or 'a blatant walkover'. Far more enticing - at least to our Irish cousin, Tapada Marnin Fiver - is Shelbourne taking on Deportivo La Coruna tomorrow, but tell that to the Depor fans: only eight have travelled to Dublin. Bah! What do they think craic is, a variation on something that B-list celebrities snort off one another's tanned and immaculately toned thighs? Oh.</p> <p>\"It seems as if we have got accustomed to living too well,\" whined the Depor coach Javier Irureta, as a fumbling flunky feather-dusted his bald pate and friskily fed him strawberries. \"They are a dangerous side. It is very much 50-50.\" Clearly.

  "Michael Howard today reopened the row over racism within the police by pledging to scrap the \"politically correct\" requirement on officers to record the ethnicity of all people stopped on the street. <p>The Conservative leader made the controversial call in a speech on crime in Middlesbrough aimed at putting \"clear blue water\" between the Tories and Labour on the issue of law and order in the run-up to next year's likely general election. </p> <p>Such is the importance the party is attaching to the keynote address, which covered all aspects of law and order, that Mr Howard flew back from a holiday to give the speech. </p> <p>He said the police had been undermined by political correctness and would receive backing for \"zero tolerance\" policing under a Tory government. </p> <p><b>Measuring inequality</b></p> <p>More controversially, Home Office plans to give all people stopped by police a receipt detailing their race and why they were stopped would be scrapped in the event of a Tory victory at the next general election.</p> <p>The receipt scheme was recommended by the Macpherson inquiry into the racist killing of black teenager Stephen Lawrence as a way of discouraging police from using \"stop powers\" disproportionately against black and Asian people. </p> <p>It has been piloted in seven areas of the country and is due to go nationwide by April 1 next year. </p> <p>Overall race totals will be monitored in a bid to crack down on officers who stop too many black people and Asians; at present records are kept only of people who are stopped and then searched. </p> <p>Mr Howard's speech came just a month after the police were accused of \"Islamophobia\" when figures showed the number of Asians targeted by stop and search powers had risen 302%. </p> <p>The number of overall searches increased dramatically, but the figures showed Asians saw the highest increases in stop and searches under the Terrorism Act powers, rising 302% from 744 in 2001-02 to 2,989 in 2002-03. </p> <p>Black people were also six times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than whites, the figures revealed. </p> <p><b>Shades of Hague</b></p> <p>Mr Howard's speech was remarkably similar to one made by William Hague in December 2000 - also just months before a general election campaign - in which he defended the right to stop and search and said the Macpherson report had been used to dub every police officer a racist.</p> <p>Even before Mr Howard's speech had been delivered, it attracted a chorus of disapproval. Mark Oaten, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said Mr Howard appeared determined to \"make the situation worse\". </p> <p>He said: \"There are some corners that cannot be cut. Last month the government admitted that too many people from ethnic minorities were being stopped and searched. Michael Howard seems determined to make this situation worse.\" </p> <p>Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote, which encourages ethnic minorities to participate in the democratic process, accused Mr Howard of \"sanctioning the demonisation of black and Asian youth\". The Tory policy was \"deeply disappointing\", he said. </p> <p>Mr Woolley attacked the system of stop and search as a \"draconian, humiliating, 'sledgehammer to crack a nut' approach to crime\". </p> <p>The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, also defended the use of receipts, saying it aided community relations.</p> <p><b>'PC mumbo jumbo'</b></p> <p>In a wide-ranging speech, Mr Howard pledged to scrap the electronic tagging programme, which allows prisoners out of jail early.</p> <p>Mr Howard said 3,500 crimes, including nine serious sex crimes, had been committed by tagged offenders since the tagging scheme was introduced in 1999. </p> <p>\"I have had enough of the culture of political correctness,\" Mr Howard said. \"The clear distinction between right and wrong has been lost in sociological mumbo jumbo and politically correct nonsense.\"</p> <p>Pledging to increase prison capacity, he said: \"It's not a question of if we build new prisons, it is a question of how many new prisons we build and what kind of prisons they are.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard went on to dispute the accuracy of the British Crime Survey, which the government claims gives the most accurate picture of crime trends in the UK. </p> <p>The Tory leader noted that the survey excluded an estimated 12m crimes a year. </p> <p>Recorded crime statistics showed crime in England and Wales had risen by 85% in the last five years and violent crime by 83%, Mr Howard said, suggesting that these statistics were \"the most reliable\". </p> <p><b>Personal responsibility</b></p> <p>He said there had been a \"dramatic decline\" in personal responsibility and he disputed the validity of the term \"antisocial behaviour\" to describe activities such as drunkenness, intimidation and overturning litter bins. </p> <p>\"That behaviour is not just antisocial - it's wrong ... and people shouldn't be allowed to get away with it,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Many people now believe that they are no longer wholly responsible for their actions; it's someone else's or something else's fault: the environment, society, the government. </p> <p>\"All too often, teachers cannot discipline pupils let alone expel them from school,\" he added.</p> <p>\"We will introduce enforceable home-school contracts that spell out both parents' and pupils' responsibilities, and we will give heads complete control over expulsion. </p> <p>\"If they decide to expel a disruptive pupil, they will not be second-guessed by an outside panel.\" </p> <p>The Tories would introduce a \"strong legal presumption\" in favour of equal rights for parents in a child's upbringing so that more families could benefit from a father's influence, Mr Howard said.</p>",
  "An Islamist militant group today posted an internet message claiming responsibility for the Istanbul bombings in which two people were killed and 11 wounded last night. <p>The Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades said the attacks were the first of a \"wave of operations\" in European countries, warning that worse was to come. </p> <p>\"Istanbul is the opening for the bloody war we promised the Europeans,\" the statement, posted on a site known for publishing the messages of militant groups, said. It was not possible to check its authenticity. </p> <p>Western counter-terrorism experts have questioned the credibility of Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades, which has previously claimed to be behind events - including power failures in Britain and north America - in which it had not played a role. </p> <p>The group takes its name from a leading al-Qaida lieutenant who was killed in a US airstrike in Afghanistan in 2001. </p> <p>In its message, the group said the details of the bombings in Istanbul, and the way in which the bombs were set, would be published later. The statement did not specify the targets. </p> <p>Bombs exploded at two small hotels in Istanbul as well as a liquefied petroleum gas plant on the outskirts of the city. It was not immediately clear whether the explosions had been the work of the same organisation. </p> <p>\"The first strike that hit Istanbul is nothing but the beginning of a series of attacks in the face of European capitals,\" the statement said. </p> <p>\"As we have said before, Europe's trailing behind the despicable [US President George] Bush will lead to an escalating war that will not end until Europe changes its policies toward Muslims and rejects American criminal policies.\" </p> <p>The statement referred to a three-month truce that the al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, had offered European governments in April, urging them to withdraw their forces from Iraq, Afghanistan and other Muslim countries. </p> <p>Since the truce expired on July 15, Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades has repeatedly threatened Europe with an all-out campaign of terrorism. </p> <p>The statement said that, because Europe had not responded to Bin Laden's truce, \"we will translate our words to acts on the ground, like we did in Madrid and Istanbul\". </p> <p>The quotation referred to the Madrid train bombings in March - in which around 200 people were killed - and the recent attacks in Istanbul. </p> <p>Two Turkish soldiers died in last night's blasts, which were triggered by remote control and have been described by police as \"terrorist attacks\". </p> <p>Turkish television showed emergency services personnel carrying casualties, mostly foreigners, to ambulances at the scene. Glass and debris were scattered on the street.</p> <p>Earlier, local reports had blamed Kurdish rebels for the attacks. Istanbul has been on high alert after a series of terrorist attacks linked to al-Qaida. </p> <p>The blasts, in the tourist district of Sultanahmet - the historical heart of Turkey's biggest city - happened at around 2am local time (2200 BST). An hour later, on the edge of the city, two other bombs exploded at a gas storage complex, Reuters said. </p> <p>Istanbul has been repeatedly targeted by bombings in recent years. Last night's attack came amid intensified fighting in the region, sparked when Kurdish rebels declared an end to a five-year unilateral ceasefire on June 1.</p> <p>Last November, more than 60 people died in four Istanbul suicide bomb attacks by al-Qaida linked groups. The British consulate, the HSBC bank headquarters and Jewish targets were attacked, and the leading UK diplomat in the city, consul-general Roger Short, was among the dead. </p> <p>In June, four people were killed and 15 others wounded in an explosion on a bus in Istanbul. The blast happened shortly before the US president, George Bush, arrived in the city for a Nato summit.</p>",
  "<p>The government is expected to unveil plans tomorrow to crack down on Britain's 1 million uninsured drivers. </p> <p>It is estimated that at least 1 million people, or 5% of British motorists, break the law by driving without insurance, and accidents involving these drivers cost more than \u00a3500m a year. </p> <p>As a result, insurers pass the cost on in the form of an additional 6%, or \u00a330, on top of the average motor insurance policy.</p> <p>People involved in accidents with uninsured drivers usually have to claim on their own policies, which means they lose out on no-claims discounts and are liable for any policy excess - often several hundred pounds.</p> <p>A range of recommendations on dealing with the problem are expected to come out of an independent review of the problem by David Greenaway, professor of economics at the University of Nottingham. These are likely to include stricter punishment for people caught driving without insurance and stronger enforcement of the law by the police.</p> <p>Research by the Association of British Insurers has shown uninsured drivers to be more likely to be involved in serious driving offences than insured drivers, 10 times more likely to drink and drive and six times more likely to drive an unroadworthy car.</p> <p>Ahead of Prof Greenaway's report, a survey of over 1,000 motorists carried out by insurer More Than showed that there was strong support for firmer action against uninsured drivers. Almost a third (30%) of people said they would favour the confiscation of vehicles, and the same amount said uninsured drivers should be subject to a total ban. A fifth said that there should be a large fine, while 16% even favoured imprisonment. </p> <p>David Pitt, head of motor insurance at More Than, said: \"The problem of uninsured drivers has been escalating and is an issue that needs to be tackled. Rather than being seen as another anti-motorist measure, our research shows that this would be a popular move by the government.\" </p> <p>More Than would like to see the existing databases of taxed vehicles, a motor insurers' database of insured vehicles and the police national computer linked together in an effort to tackle the problem.</p>",
  "<p>It's not the news that students were hoping for. Fewer than two thirds of last years' graduates are currently in fulltime jobs, government figures showed today.</p> <p>Nor was it the news the government wanted. The first graduates from its foundation degrees, two-year vocational courses designed to make graduates ready for work, only had a 30% fulltime employment rate. </p> <p>The news came in a Higher Education Statistics Agency report. The agency tracked students six months after they graduated in June 2003 to find out what happened next. It revealed that relatively few graduates are unemployed, but many are taking their time to find a career. </p> <p>Of the 182,300 students who got a degree last year 62.8% have entered the world of full time work, 16% have continued their studies, 8% are combining work with study, others were working abroad or unaccounted for but 7.1% were unemployed.</p> <p>The government responded with a declaration that it was \"still a good time to be a graduate\". </p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education and Skills said that it took time for students to find their feet: \"This new survey looks at destinations six months after leaving university, but we know that graduate unemployment falls significantly over time. Recent evidence shows that just 1-2% graduates are unemployed and seeking work, seven years after graduation.\"</p> <p>The government also seized on the research to justify key policies for students; including their policy of getting more young people into universities. Tony Blair has set a target for 50% of 18-30 years olds to have some experience of higher education by 2010. The spokesperson claimed it would be \"reckless and irresponsible\" to deny that employers needed more graduates. </p> <p>Ministers also claimed that the lower unemployment rate for the 800 graduates of the first cohort of foundation degrees was, at 4.2% \"encouraging\", particularly because this was where they had anticipated the bulk of the expansion.</p> <p>However the government's optimism was overshadowed by the fact that only 30% of foundation degree graduates were in jobs. Another 40.1% had opted to remain in education indicating that they were opting to take the third year to \"top-up\" their foundation degree to a full degree. </p> <p>Employment varied widely depending on the graduate's degree. Medicine and dentistry, which traditionally have the lowest rates of unemployment, maintained their pre-eminence with just 0.2% of graduates out of work. Meanwhile one in ten creative arts and design students were out of a job, and 12.4% of computer science graduates.</p> <p>The National Union of Students appealed for students not to take the figures to heart. James Knight, president of the NUS in Wales, said: \"I think it's fair to say that having a degree by no means guarantees employment. But people choose to study for different reasons and it's not just about employability. </p> <p>\"They should definitely still do those degrees [with the lowest employment rates]. Can you imagine a society where no one studies history? It would be catastrophic if arts were only studied by those who could afford to do so.\"</p> <p><strong>Unemployment rates by subject area (2003 graduates)</strong></p> <p>Medicine and dentistry: 0.2% <br> Subjects allied to medicine: 2.8% <br> Education: 3.1%<br> Veterinary science: 2.9%<br> Architecture, building &amp; planning: 4.9%<br> Business and administrative studies: 7.0%<br> Mass communications and documentation: 9.4% <br> Agriculture and related subjects: 5.3% <br> Creative arts and design: 10.5% <br> Computer science: 12.4% <br>Social studies: 6.5% <br> Combined: 7.6%<br> Engineering and technology: 10.2% <br> Languages: 6.3% <br> Biological sciences: 6.5%<br> Mathematical sciences: 7.2% <br> Historical and philosophical studies: 7.2% <br> Physical sciences: 7.9% <br> Law: 3.7% <br> Total: 7.1%</p>",
  "<p>Imagine you live on a foul-smelling, polluted wasteland with no electricity, no water and no sanitation. You have no access to family healthcare. You live in constant fear of being forced to move home in the face of racism. </p> <p>This is the situation faced by those who belong to what the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE), Trevor Phillips, recently described as \"probably the single most intensely discriminated against\" ethnic group in the UK - Gypsies and Travellers.</p> <p>A series of court battles between local authorities and Gypsies and Travellers has highlighted the terrible conditions in which Britain's 300,000 travelling people often live. </p> <p>Last week, the high court ruled that a group of Gypsies could stay on a site they bought a year ago despite installing electricity cables, water pipes and septic tanks without planning permission from North Wiltshire district council. The judge, John Weeks QC, sitting at Bristol high court, said that to avoid suffering unnecessary hardship the 56 men, women and children could stay on the three-acre field in Minety, Wiltshire, until after a planning inquiry next February.</p> <p>Over the past decade the number of such illegal encampments on land privately owned by Gypsies has risen sharply. There were almost 2,000 last year - up 40% from 2003. </p> <p>Campaigners for travelling people blame this increase, and the bitter legal wrangles they provoke, on the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act (1994), which removed the statutory duty on local councils to provide caravan sites. </p> <p>There are now just 324 local authority sites where under 6,000 caravans are pitched. It was intended that the 1994 act would lead to the creation of more private sites. But government research shows that 90% of planning applications made by travelling communities are refused, so few new encampments have been created. </p> <p>The result is more travelling people being forced to live in unsanitary, even dangerous, conditions on unauthorised sites, according to Sasha Barton, senior policy officer (gypsies and travellers) at the CRE. </p> <p>She said: \"The 1994 act had a massive impact on the availability and reduction in public sites. It was expected that more private sites would be set up but this didn't happen. This led to more unauthorised encampments that in turn lead to evictions and planning enforcement disputes.</p> <p>\"With no official address, travelling people cannot start up treatment, and have no transferable healthcare records. While they do access hospital accident and emergency departments they don't get preventive healthcare such as childhood immunisation. Often they only get care once they reach crisis point.\"</p> <p>The CRE is lobbying the government to amend the housing bill to reintroduce a statutory duty on councils to meet the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers. The move is backed by the Local Government Association, which is concerned about the spiralling costs of litigation on small rural councils. </p> <p>Whatever the motivation, the move is backed by Luke Clements, director of the traveller law research unit at Cardiff University. He said: \"All the legislation up to 1994 had been to integrate travellers and provide them with secure sites. Research shows that since the act there's been a significant decline in the number of sites and the condition they're in. </p> <p>\"New sites have not been built and existing sites have fallen into disrepair, which has led to more precarious lifestyles with travelling people forced to move from place to place and camp on poor sites.\"</p> <p>Mr Clements, a solicitor and lecturer, said that due to public hostility and official indifference many official and unofficial sites are situated on roadsides, near sewage works or tips. \"The most worrying aspect is the poor health of travelling children due to poor sanitation,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Only around half of the sites have clean water and there's a lot where you can see raw sewage in puddles. I've come back from sites with a sore throat for a week. They're effectively living in third world conditions. There's also a high accident rate among the children due to the poor conditions, especially those living next to busy roads.\" </p> <p>One Traveller, called Mike, told SocietyGuardian.co.uk that a local council had refused to let them use the septic tanks despite several children falling ill. He said: \"When we had the septic tanks cleaned the council got an injunction to stop us using them. We have no proper showers. We've only got running water because one of the local people who lives nearby has let us attach a water meter to her supply.\"</p> <p>Margaret Greenfields, a trustee of the Travellers Aid Trust, said that the \"appalling\" conditions on unofficial sites were exacerbated by poor access to healthcare. \"Unofficial sites, particularly those on the roadside may not get a regular postal delivery if at all,\" she said. \"With the added problem of poor adult literacy, missed appointments are common.\" </p> <p>She said that she knew of cases where people had been turned away from GP surgeries either due to negative stereotypes about the travelling community or pressure from local authorities to deny them treatment. She said some councils fear that if Travellers register with a doctor it will be harder to move them on or to deny them planning permission. </p> <p>\"High maternal death rates are a serious problem among travelling people,\" said Ms Greenfields. \"But if you can't access a GP how can you access antenatal screening?\" She said that there were a few isolated examples of good practice, such as the National Association of Health Workers with Travellers and a dedicated health visitor service. But she said health and social care staff needed more training to improve the quality of care provided to travelling communities.</p> <p>\"The main stereotype is you cannot work with them, they're going to be non-compliant,\" said Ms Greenfields. \"There are high levels of ignorance and fear among care staff. A lot of it's based on fear. Social workers think they will get attacked by dogs. They're worried about large numbers of children wandering about, and think traveller people won't necessarily be honest about their situation. </p> <p>\"I remember one case where a travelling family asked for help from the local council for their daughter who was disturbed and kept running away. The local authority wouldn't help them. They said: 'She's a traveller - of course she'll run away'!\"</p> <p>Over the past four decades a series of small-scale studies has found that the health and life expectancy of travelling people may be substantially worse than that of the general population. Perhaps most worryingly, researchers have repeatedly identified extremely high levels of infant mortality and stillbirth.</p> <p>Next month, the Department of Health (DoH) is due to publish a report on the health of adult Gypsies and Travellers. The research, led by Professor Glenys Parry at the University of Sheffield, should provide the first comprehensive national picture of the community's health needs. </p> <p>Sasha Barton blames the current dearth of information on the failure of local officials to recognise Gypsies and Travellers as an ethnic group. \"Some people are aware that Romany Gypsies are an ethnic group but not Irish Travellers,\" she said. </p> <p>She hopes that the DoH research will provide health and social care agencies with the information to provide more appropriate support to Gypsies and Travellers. </p> <p>\"There are poor outcomes but no statistics that could provide the basis of policy,\" she said. \"There's a lot more to be done but we hope that the DoH report marks the start of a more positive attitude towards meeting the needs of travelling people.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government today said it would pay tuition fees for medical students in their fifth and sixth years as it launched schemes to attract young people from poor families and ethnic minority communities to train as doctors.</p> <p>The health minister, John Hutton, announced details of nine schemes around England, costing a total of \u00a39m. They will aim to encourage people from disadvantaged backgrounds to become doctors, nurses and allied health professionals.</p> <p>The help with fees was welcomed by the British Medical Association (BMA). However a spokesman said that medical students were still likely to graduate with debts of up to \u00a360,000, mainly because of living costs.</p> <p>Research shows that 74% of the medical school population come from the highest three social classes, although just 38% of the working age population is from this background, said the Department of Health. Asian ethnic groups are underrepresented in applicants to nursing courses, and there is evidence that black and ethnic minority applicants have difficulty in securing course places.</p> <p>Mr Hutton said it was vital that the NHS workforce reflected the community as well as improving the health of all sections of the community. \"We need more doctors, nurses and AHPs and we need them from all walks of life. It is unacceptable that some people are effectively held back from these professions because of their financial, social or cultural background.</p> <p>\"The minister also announced today that the Department of Health would meet the full cost of variable tuition fees for medical and dental students in years five and six of the standard undergraduate courses, and years two, three and four of fast-track courses. From 2006 universities will able to charge up to \u00a33,000 in tuition fees, which graduates will repay when they start working. This brings medical students into line with students training to be nurses and other health professionals.</p> <p>\"These projects and the department's commitment to meet medical and dental students' tuition fees will open doors to young people from low-income backgrounds who would previously never have thoughts about a career in the NHS,\" said Mr Hutton.</p> <p>However, Phil Willis, the Liberal Democrat Education spokesman, dismissed the fees announcement as a classic piece of Labour spin. </p> <p>\"The government is pretending to solve a problem that it has created in the first place. It is absurd that Labour now expects applause for freeing students from Labour fees,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Fees equal debt and debt will deter many students from going to university. For years Labour has ignored the evidence and burdened students with mortgage-style debts. Now Ministers are forced to admit that they cannot recruit enough young people to become doctors.\" </p> <p>Leigh Bissett, chairman of the BMA's medical students committee, said: \"Medicine is dominated by students from the highest social classes, and this is a welcome opportunity to give more young people the chance to become doctors. Widening access is the responsibility of the government as well as the medical profession, and we are pleased to see the Department of Health taking the issues seriously.\"</p> <p>Of the nine regional schemes being launched by the department with the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), one in London specifically targets African-Caribbean students and disadvantaged young people who have traditionally been excluded from career progression. It will work with teacher and parents to provide an understanding of the qualities, skills and qualifications that students will need to train in healthcare. It will also carry out an analysis of the admissions procedures in the NHS and medical schools.</p> <p>The project being run in the North-West region will use mentoring and community engagement to encourage children from disadvantaged backgrounds to enrol in vocational healthcare training schemes.</p>",
  "More than five years after it was published, and more than a decade after the racist killing of Stephen Lawrence, whose death and investigation it chronicled, the Macpherson report still has the power to cause ructions - not least among Conservative party leaders. <p>Michael Howard, who became home secretary just a month after the black teenager's murder in April 1993, returned to the landmark report of 1999, which famously declared the police \"institutionally racist\". It also called for the introduction of ethnic monitoring of all police stops. It did not, contrary to some misconceptions, call for an end to stop and search.</p> <p>Mr Howard's pledge to scrap plans for the issuing of ethnic \"receipts\" to all people stopped, not just searched, by the police is a direct rebuttal of one of the key findings of the report.</p> <p>And it is not the first by a Conservative leader.</p> <p>Four-and-a-half years ago, the then Tory chief, William Hague, used a speech to the rightwing Centre for Policy Studies to attack the Macpherson report. With just under six months to go before the general election of June 2001, Mr Hague came out with all guns blazing.</p> <p>He appeared to blame the Macpherson report for a \"collapse of police morale and recruitment\" - certainly, this was the way it was sold in a leak to the Sun and reported the next day.</p> <p>In fact, his words were slightly more carefully chosen to apportion blame away from Lord Macpherson. Mr Hague actually said: \"The way in which the Macpherson report has been used to brand every officer and every branch of the force as racist, has contributed directly to a collapse of police morale and recruitment, and has led to a crisis on our streets.\" </p> <p>However, his clarity was not helped by getting his figures wrong, as he blamed a reduction in stop and search for a rise in street crime. He told his audience that the number of arrests following stop and searches had fallen by around 7,000 when in fact the fall was just 711. Conservative Central Office later apologised for the cock-up, but it didn't help lessen the sense that he was finding his statistics to fit his argument.</p> <p>At the time of his controversial speech, Mr Hague's party had collapsed in the polls, their brief lead over Labour three months earlier during the fuel protests having reversed into a six-point deficit.</p> <p>The Tories dubbed his speech \"the most important on crime in a decade\", although the Guardian dismissed it in a leader article as \"a breathtaking collection of dishonest facts, misrepresentations and plain lies\". Stephen Lawrence's father, Neville, accused Mr Hague of \"playing the race card\".</p> <p>Today in Middlesbrough, Mr Howard renewed his predecessor's attack on Macpherson's findings, pledging to ditch his recommendation to introduce ethnic monitoring of all police stops and other \"politically correct nonsense\". </p> <p>Among such \"sociological mumbo-jumbo\" the Tory leader included the phrase \"anti-social behaviour\", the government's favourite all encompassing term for low-level crime, currently the focus of a high-profile government crackdown.</p> <p>But it is not only his use of such populist language that echoes Mr Hague's controversial speech, it is also the comparably poor position of the Tory party.</p> <p>Despite a new sense of professionalism since Mr Howard took over from the hapless Iain Duncan Smith, the party still languishes five percentage points behind Labour according to the latest ICM/Guardian poll.</p> <p>It has also been knocked by its inability to mount a challenge to Labour in the two recent Leicester and Birmingham byelections; overtaken by the Liberal Democrats despite coming second in both seats at the last general election.</p> <p>Like Mr Hague, Mr Howard finds it hard to score points off a government that is so determined to seize the traditionally rightwing ground from under it. A recent example of this was the chancellor's decision to award the Home Office an addition \u00a32.2bn to fight crime in the last spending review.</p> <p>Tony Blair's determination to retain the initiative on law and order - which he seized as shadow home secretary when he promised to be \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" - has meant that the controversial issue of ethnic minority policing is one of the few where the Tories can strike a noticeably different position.</p> <p>Will it help Mr Howard turn his party's fortune around in the polls? Well it didn't work for William Hague. We should know very shortly whether Mr Howard, who has jetted in from holiday in Tuscany to deliver this keynote speech, has more success.</p>",
  "The judge who issued arrest warrants against the controversial Iraqi politician Ahmad Chalabi and his nephew Salem, the head of the tribunal that will try Saddam Hussein, yesterday denied the move was politically motivated and said he would pursue the extradition of the two men if they refused to return to Iraq. <p>Zuhair al-Maliky, the senior investigative judge at the central criminal court of Iraq, established by the US occupation authorities, told the Guardian: \"I am simply the judge who signed the documents. Anything that either of the two wanted men have to say should be said in court in Iraq, and if they don't come here we have our channels and we will contact Interpol.\"</p> <p>He declined to reveal the nature of the evidence that had prompted the charges, but said: \"This is nothing to do with politics. We are trying to introduce the rule of law and these men must be questioned and if there is enough evidence they should go to trial.\"</p> <p>Ahmad Chalabi, the founder of the Iraqi National Congress (INC) and a key US ally in the run-up to the invasion, is accused of counterfeiting money.</p> <p>More seriously Salem Chalabi, a US-educated lawyer who heads the Iraq special tribunal, is wanted for the murder of Haitham Fadhil, a senior official with the ministry of finance.</p> <p>Both men deny the charges.</p> <p>The latest controversy to engulf Ahmad Chalabi, who has fallen out with his former US sponsors, was dismissed yesterday as a minor storm by Iraqi government officials.</p> <p>They are more concerned, however, that the allegations against Salem Chalabi could undermine Iraqis' faith in the process of trying the former dictator and his henchmen. \"It does not look good,\" an interior ministry official said. \"But Salem is only the organiser and he is not a judge.\"</p> <p>In Jordan one of Saddam's lawyers called Salem Chalabi's warrant a victory for his client.</p> <p>Salem Chalabi said yesterday the charges would only benefit former Ba'athist officials, including Saddam, who is facing trial for war crimes. \"They can easily make allegations that this whole process is fraud because the director of the tribunal has all these charges against him,\" he said in London.</p> <p>He said he would return to Iraq to fight the charges and bring Saddam to justice, but wanted guarantees of his safety.</p> <p>The charges against Ahmad Chalabi relate to a raid on his Baghdad house in May by Iraqi police and US troops. An INC spokesman in Baghdad said that the raid had turned up just 3,000 dinars, about \u00a31.</p> <p>Ahmad Chalabi, who is in Tehran, said the charges were political. \"The idea that I was involved in counterfeiting is ridiculous.\"</p> <p>He also hit out at the investigating judge. \"[Mr Maliky] is not a bona fide Iraqi judge but rather an unqualified person who was put in his position by the American occupation authorities,\" he said. \"He has pursued a political vendetta against the Iraqi National Congress.\"</p> <p>Supporters said yesterday that the timing of the warrant could be designed to prevent Ahmad Chalabi mediating in the crisis in Najaf.</p> <p>A spokesman for the prime minister, Ayed Allawi, said the interim government would not interfere in the judicial procedure. \"We will wait and watch. Unlike under the former regime, the courts and judges must remain free and independent,\" he said.</p>",
  "This much we know. On June 20, Corporal Wassef Ali Hassoun, a Lebanese-born American marine, went missing from his base near Falluja in Iraq. The military said he was \"missing\" on \"unauthorised leave\". <p>The following Sunday, June 27, the 24-year-old turned up on the Arab satellite network al-Jazeera blindfolded with a sword at his head. His captors said they would behead him unless all Iraqi prisoners were released from US controlled prisons. On July 29 the military reclassified him as \"captured\". </p> <p>On July 3 his gruesome murder was posted on the internet. \"As your soldier had a love affair with a young Arab woman, he has been lured from the base\" and \"slaughtered\", announced a radical Islamist group. The next day another group posted another message saying he was alive. On July 5 they said he was \"in a safe place\". </p> <p>On July 6 the family in Lebanon said they had received \"a sign ... that nobody else could possibly know\" that proved he was still alive. On July 8 he turned up at the American embassy in the Lebanese capital of Beirut with his family. </p> <p>What prompted each of those events, and what happened in between them, however, is unclear. Hassoun's return to American custody, (he is now in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, being debriefed) marked both the end of a long personal ordeal, and just one more stage in a national mystery. For if the facts that we do know about the Hassoun case are peculiar, the facts we do not allude to something possibly even stranger. The manner of his disappearance, the terms of his reappearance, the video of his capture, the means by which he made it to Lebanon and his family's role in negotiating his release - all are at best mysterious, and at worst dubious. </p> <p>The army's original conclusion was that he was a deserter - and while the official version has changed to say that he was kidnapped, there are few officials who believe it. \"The whole thing has been one of the strangest things I've seen while in the marine corps,\" Lieutenant Colonel, T V Johnson, who is in Falluja, told the Salt Lake Tribune. \"It's going to take a thorough investigation to get to the bottom of what happened.\" </p> <p>The most that the military will admit is that it doesn't know what happened to Hassoun, but that it hopes to find out. Participating in inquiries is the naval criminal investigative service, the law-enforcement arm of the navy and marines, which investigates felony cases. \"If there are extenuating circumstances connected to something that looks like a larger crime, and in this case it was suspected foul play ... that's when we get involved.\" The fact that it remains involved does not look good for Hassoun. </p> <p>As for the marine himself, in the only statement he has made since his release, he said: \"I did not desert my post. I was captured and held against my will by anti-coalition forces for 19 days ... Once a marine always a marine.\" </p> <p>So what really happened? The last people to see Hassoun, his fellow marines at the base, say he was distressed by the death of a fellow soldier in the 1st marine expeditionary force. The next day he failed to report for duty. At this early stage in the story the first question marks over Hassoun's abduction arise. </p> <p>First comes the matter of how insurgents could have taken him from such a tightly guarded compound without waking anyone up or otherwise causing a commotion. According to some sources his locker had also been cleared and when he left, some of his clothes were missing. It was on this basis that the US military concluded that he had deserted, possibly heading for his extended family in Lebanon. </p> <p>\"He wanted to go home and quit the game, but since he was relatively early in his deployment, that was not going to happen any time soon,\" one officer told the New York Times, on condition of anonymity. \"So he talked to some folks on base he befriended because they were all fellow Muslims, and they helped sneak him off. Once off, instead of helping him get home, they turned him over to the bad guys.\" </p> <p>The army reported 2,781 deserters in 2003 and 1,470 in the first five months of this year, according to Lieutenant Colonel John Jessup, who collects army desertion data for the Pentagon. This makes up less than 1% of the enlisted soldiers; far lower than the average of 5% during the Vietnam war years, a fact explained largely by the absence of a draft for this war. </p> <p>Accusations that Hassoun was one of them and had been lured away and then trapped has hit the rest of his family, who live in the Mormon-dominated state of Utah, very hard. \"To question his loyalty and nationalism is wrong,\" says his older brother, Mohamad Hassoun. \"Of course we are offended.\" </p> <p>Some believe that the allegations smack of anti-Muslim prejudice. \"Muslims have to prove their loyalty again and again,\" says Iqbal Hossain, president of the Khadeeja Islamic centre in West Valley city, Utah. They \"might not have been made had he not been a Muslim . . . It's a question of family honour. Just because he's a Muslim doesn't mean he would desert his country.\" Indeed, although religious, even Hassoun's family in Tripoli seem exceptionally pro-American. His brother, who speaks English with an American accent, says that his family have been in the US and loyal to it for generations. </p> <p>Wassef Ali Hassoun was born in Lebanon in 1980 and educated at American schools there. He moved to the US in 2000 and lived with his brothers near Salt Lake City for two years, where he studied part time at college and worked in sales, before joining the marines in 2West Jordan001. Few even among the Muslim community in West Jordan, the suburb of Salt Lake City where his family settled, appear to have known him well. Neighbours say the family kept themselves to themselves. </p> <p>He married and divorced an American some time ago and, earlier this year, married his first cousin in absentia. His father represented him in the ceremony in Tripoli, as is sometimes the case when the groom is out of the country. His bride could not be reached for comment. </p> <p>Fluent in Arabic, French and English, Hassoun worked as an interpreter in the military, as well as driving trucks and Humvees. When his capture thrust his military service to the fore the entire community of West Jordan rallied around his family. Boy scouts covered the front garden in flags, while Mormon women came and asked if they could pray with them. </p> <p>\"We wanted to honour them during their special time in their sacred, um, what do you call this building?\" Irene Smith asked the New York Times, referring to the local mosque. \"We feel like we are all a little part of a larger community.\" </p> <p>The same kind of community spirit has not been visited on his family in Lebanon, where animosity to the US military's role in Iraq made them local pariahs. </p> <p>Fortunately for the Lebanese Hassouns, they appear to be able to look after themselves. Numbering around 4,000, in Tripoli they refer to themselves not so much as a family as a clan. They live on Hassoun Street, a long road in the Abu Samra neighbourhood just outside Tripoli which is inhabited entirely by members of the marine's family. Finding it is easy, as intrigued Tripolitans direct reporters to \"the American's house\". Children playing in the street are all cousins, while in a nearby shop, Hassoun's uncle, Hussein, is paying a visit to a relative. </p> <p>\"He is a very, very good boy. Very calm and God-fearing - like all the Hassoun boys,\" says the seventysomething man. \"He is very well mannered. He would never cross his parents and never hang out outside like those children.\" </p> <p>After the marine's release a relative reportedly shot and killed a man in Tripoli who had accused the family of being \"US traitors\". The shooting spree shook the area. Two people died, and two others were injured; several shops belonging to the Hassouns were also smashed up. </p> <p>After the video of their relative in the marines appeared on al-Jazeera, the Hassouns reportedly set about using their considerable connections to secure his release. But at a time when the kidnappings and beheadings of American non-military appeared to be escalating, there seemed little hope. \"We would like to inform you that the marine of Lebanese origin, Hassoun, has been slaughtered,\" read the message from the radical islamist group, al-Sunna army. \"You are going to see the video with your very own eyes soon.\" </p> <p>Quite what made the hardliners of al-Sunna change their mind, disowning the message and vouching for Hassoun's safety, is also unclear. \"We received a signal that he was released long before it became official, but I will say no more,\" says Hassoun's brother Sami. </p> <p>Some reports attributed the mediation to the Mufti of the city of Aleppo in Syria, Sheikh Ahmed Hassoun, who allegedly interceded with the Association of Muslim Scholars, an Iraqi group, which has had a hand in the release of several hostages. But the Mufti later denied involvement, saying: \"We do not believe in the language of kidnapping.\" He also denied any family ties with the Hassouns of Lebanon. All sides - both in Syria and Lebanon - seem to want to distance themselves from Hassoun's release. </p> <p>Which leads us to the final mystery: how Hassoun made it 500 miles from Falluja in Iraq to his family in Lebanon. \"As far as we know, he never entered Lebanon. There is no way for him to enter Lebanon without our knowledge,\" says a senior customs official, speaking on condition of anonymity. </p> <p>His family brought him from Tripoli to Beirut, according to US embassy spokeswoman Elizabeth Wharton. On July 8 he called the embassy and asked for them to meet him at three o'clock in a cafe in Beirut. Hassoun didn't show up. Then he called again and changed the time to six. This time he was there and was escorted back by an attache. </p> <p>Asked whether Hassoun is a deserter, one White House official involved in counter terrorism says: \"Not interested in serving is a better way to put it.\" The most likely scenario, say most insiders, is that he may have panicked and asked local Iraqis to help him escape. They either traduced him or staged the capture and then facilitated his return to his family. But like just about everything else in the story, the only person who knows is Hassoun - and he's not saying. </p> <p>After reporting to the embassy, Hassoun was taken from Beirut to an army base in Landstuhl, Germany. From there he went to a marine base at Quantico, Virginia and then finally to Camp Lejeune, where, between debriefings and visits from a Muslim chaplain, he spends most of his time watching TV and relaxing with his eldest brother Mohamad. </p> <p>Base personnel say Hassoun can take \"as long as he needs\" for the repatriation process before the tough questions begin. According to Sally Harvey, a clinical psychologist at Landstuhl: \"We want to give him a chance to tell his story.\"</p>",
  "<p>Twice as many students will graduate this year owing more than \u00a310,000 compared with last year, a survey revealed today.</p> <p>The sharp rise in the most heavily indebted students saw the number of graduates owing more than \u00a310,000 soar from 31% last year to 59% this year. The average debt leapt \u00a34,055 to \u00a312,180.</p> <p>A third of graduates believe they will spend the next ten years paying for their education - again, twice as many as believed that last year.</p> <p>The sudden sharp increase was blamed by the people behind the survey on the ongoing impact of fees and the decrease in parents opting to support their children through university - 34% did not receive any help from their parents at all this year compared with 25% last year. </p> <p>Ann Marie Blake, head of the student department at NatWest, which today published its annual survey of prospective and current students as well as recent graduates, said: \"We think the rise in debt is down to a combination of factors. Obviously there's the impact of tuition fees and the general rise in the cost of living. But there was also contribution of parents. Perhaps if you've got a couple of children at university, you can't afford to help them as much.\"</p> <p>James Knight, president of National Union of Students in Wales, said: \"It's any number of things. The cost of living has gone up including housing prices - that's hit students hard. Privatised halls are more expensive and not particularly well maintained. </p> <p>\"I think parent contributions are significant. Debt generally is going up so that affects how much money parents have for their children.\"</p> <p>Most six formers preparing for university believe that they will have to fork out \u00a326,000 over three years in fees, rent and living expenses. Most have budgeted around \u00a3950 a month. And they are not far wrong. Those already at university are spending at a rate which will see their final outgoings reach nearly \u00a324,000 after three years.</p> <p>But NatWest claimed there was also good news. \"This year's average starting salary is up 7% to \u00a313,600, which proves that the cost of university is clearly an investment in your future earning potential. What's more, since graduating 41% claim to have gained a good career and independence from their parents and 30% have invested in their own property and claim to have a healthier bank balance,\" said Ms Blake. The \u00a313,600 figure is an average which includes graduates who have stayed in academia as well as high flying graduate recruits. </p> <p>Surprisingly, fewer students are entering the world of work before they graduate. Only 35% of undergraduates have a part time job to help them get by, an 18% fall from 2003, but those working are working hard and earning relatively high wages. The average student is now taking home \u00a34,000 a year from part time work. Some 84% surveyed thought they would probably get a part time job when they started university.</p> <p>Tips to avoid the debt trap</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Think about staying in university accommodation for as long as possible - it can be cheaper than renting privately. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Make travelling home cheaper with a 5-Year Young Persons Railcard. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Shop for food with friends - buying in bulk can save money and lets you take advantage of 'buy one get one free' offers. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Claim discounts. Make sure you use your NUS or ISIC card and also look in your Student Union for one-off deals. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you do work, check whether you have to fill in a form P38(S) so that tax will not be taken off your earnings. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ask other students how much you will need to pay for bills. Complete a budget planner and regularly review it to see where your money is being spent and if it is deviating from the budget. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Record all transactions as you spend them so that there are no surprises when your bank statement arrives. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Work out how much you can afford to spend per week and draw it out on a set day rather than continuing to visit the cash machine for a tenner here and a tenner there. If you do the latter, it can quickly build up and take you to your financial limit. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you do find yourself struggling, talk to your bank as soon as possible - don't sweep cash problems under the carpet. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Avoid running up a massive debt in the first couple of months. Going out every night in the first term may make you popular but could mean a serious lack of social life later in the year.</p>",

  "I am delighted to be here in Middlesbrough with Ray Mallon this morning. <p>Ray has proved that if you want to cut crime, you can cut crime. He has shown that with decisive action and clear direction you can begin the process of urban renewal. And he has demonstrated that when local communities pull together they can start to improve everyone's quality of life. </p> <p><b>Rising Crime</b></p> <p>This is the reality of Britain today. Parents are afraid to let their children walk to school. Women fear intimidation from hooded youths as they walk home at night. And couples stay in rather than run the gauntlet of the binge drinkers who have taken over many of our towns and city centres. </p> <p>Crime undermines the quality of all our lives - and as with most failings in society it is the poorest who suffer the most. People living in deprived areas are more than twice as likely to be mugged as those living in better off neighbourhoods. </p> <p>Rising crime has left people across Britain feeling powerless and insecure. And in many places they worry that the police have become powerless too - remote and distant, unable to deal with the issues that concern their neighbourhoods the most. </p> <p><b>Crime statistics</b> </p> <p>Criminologists and commentators frequently try to downplay the problem by saying that the fear of crime is actually greater than crime itself. They appear blind to the fact that disorder and violence have became a fact of daily life in many communities across Britain. </p> <p>government ministers cite the British Crime Survey as evidence that there has been a steady decline in crime over the last nine years. But the BCS excludes lots of crimes from its calculations - such as murder, crimes against children under 16, sexual offences, dealing and taking drugs and shoplifting. It is estimated that around 12 million crimes a year don't even make it onto the BCS radar. </p> <p>The most reliable crime statistics - those crimes actually recorded by the police - show that crime in Englandand Waleshas risen by almost 850,000 in the last five years. </p> <p>While burglary and car crime have fallen: gun crime has doubled; robbery has gone up by more than half; and, most damning of all, violent crime has increased by 83%. Last year it hit the one million mark for the first time ever. That is 3,000 violent crimes every day - and more than a hundred violent crimes every hour. </p> <p><b>Respect and Responsibility</b></p> <p>There are many factors which have contributed to the breakdown of law and order in Britain today. In many ways the police, the courts and the prison service are simply picking up the pieces of other people's failures. </p> <p> As a society we are in danger of being overrun by values which eat away at people's respect for themselves, each other, their homes and their neighbourhood. </p> <p> Most damaging of all has been the dramatic decline in personal responsibility. Many people now believe that they are no longer wholly responsible for their actions. It's someone else's, or something else's fault - the environment, society, the government.</p> <p> Remember the lines from West Side Story, when the gang of hoods try to excuse their actions: \"I'm depraved on account of I'm deprived,\" says one. \"Juvenile delinquency is purely a social disease\" says another. West Side Story may have been written by an American at the tail end of the 1950s, but these attitudes are all too prevalent in British society today.</p> <p>These excuses shift the balance away from the yob, the shoplifter, the joy-rider, the mugger, any criminal, on to someone or something else. What more harmful message could we send than to say: \"It's not your fault, it is society's fault\"?</p> <p> And while responsibility has declined, rights have proliferated. \"I've got my rights\" is the verbal equivalent of two-fingers to authority. There is now a palpable sense of outrage that \"so-called\" human rights have tipped the balance of justice in favour of the criminal and the wrong-doer - rather than the victim and the law abider. </p> <p>The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of rights have left us in an ethical quagmire, which is undermining our fight against crime. The clear distinction between right and wrong has been lost in sociological mumbo-jumbo and politically correct nonsense. </p> <p>Just consider that phrase \"anti-social behaviour\" which we hear so often today. Eighteen-year-olds out after a night's drinking, overturning litter bins, pushing each other around, intimidating others - in my language, that behaviour is not just anti-social - it's wrong. Yes: it's wrong. And people shouldn't be allowed to get away with it. </p> <p>Decent, hard-working people understand this. But they also understand that while politicians and the police must take the lead in tackling crime and disorder, families and communities have a part to play too. They know that there is a right path for our society - one based on personal responsibility, moderation, truthfulness, honesty, and liberty under the law. </p> <p> Ask these people what they think is at the root of many of the problems we face in society today, and they will say obvious things. The things many politicians have been too frightened to say for far too long.</p> <p> Why do some parents allow their children out until the early hours?</p> <p>How does it help parents instil discipline if they are told that they cannot smack their children?</p> <p>Why can't teachers discipline disruptive pupils any more?</p> <p>It is to the people who ask these questions, who have been resolute but silent for so long - the backbone of our country - that I am addressing my comments to today. </p> <p>Conservatives will stand up for the silent, law abiding majority who play by the rules and pay their dues. We will put their rights first. </p> <p>Like them, I have had enough of the culture of political correctness - which is designed to blur the distinction between right and wrong. </p> <p>And like them, I have had enough of excuses for poor behaviour and crime.</p> <p>If we are to tackle crime, we must begin to challenge these attitudes head on.</p> <p><b>Failings in the Criminal Justice System</b></p> <p>But we must also tackle the fundamental problems at the heart of our criminal justice system.</p> <p>It's not just about money. This year we will spend \u00a319bn on our criminal justice system - the equivalent of \u00a3316 for every man, woman and child in the country. Home Office spending has risen by 65since 1997. Yet crime is still rising. </p> <p>It's about culture, belief, approach. At every step of the way, our criminal justice system has become overwhelmed by political correctness and paperwork.</p> <p>Political correctness and paperwork are undermining our police. The police can only do their job properly if they are able to intervene, to confront and to take action against crime and anti-social behaviour. They cannot police our streets if they have one hand tied behind their back, or if paperwork keeps them chained to their desks.</p> <p>So great is the deluge of paperwork that, for every extra police officer Labour have recruited, almost one extra bureaucrat has had to be employed. So great is the number of pen-pushers that they will not fit into the new Home Office that Labour are building.</p> <p>Mismanagement is rife in both the Crown Prosecution Service and our courts. Seven per cent of cases are abandoned because of errors by the CPS. In London alone 1,400 defendants went free last year because of delays in gathering evidence. A fifth of all trials don't start when they are meant to. </p> <p>Labour have downgraded prison as a punishment with the introduction of their early release scheme. Since it was introduced in 1999, more than 3,500 crimes have been committed by prisoners on early release - including nine serious sexual crimes.</p> <p>And finally we have failed to invest in new prison capacity, thereby constraining the ability of our courts to send persistent, serious and dangerous criminals to prison. </p> <p>This is the politics of the mad house. The first duty of government - any government - is to protect the public and maintain law and order. But government in Britain today is manifestly failing in that duty today.</p> <p><b>Solutions </b></p> <p>Restoring law and order to Britain will be a priority for the Conservatives.</p> <p>How? First, rebuilding respect. </p> <p>Children, especially boys, benefit hugely from a male influence in their lives. Of course this isn't always possible because a large number of men simply abandon their responsibilities as fathers. But there are many fathers in Britain today who do want to play their part, yet cannot get access to their children. </p> <p>Conservatives believe that there should be a strong legal presumption in favour of both parents having equal rights in the upbringing of their children. This change to our family law will mean that fathers are much more likely to remain involved in their children's lives even when families split up. </p> <p>Discipline in school is also essential if children are to learn respect for authority at an early age. I suspect that I am just one of millions of parents and grandparents bewildered and horrified by the breakdown in discipline in our schools. </p> <p>Violence in the class room is rising - up nine-fold since 1997. Yet all too often teachers cannot discipline pupils, let alone expel them from school. And it is often teachers - not pupils - who find themselves on the wrong side of the law. Only recently we had the nonsense of a teacher taken to the crown court to stand trial by jury because she had - in jest - put some tape over the mouth of a child. </p> <p>Disruptive and violent pupils don't just ruin their own education - they ruin that of every other child in the class. </p> <p>We will introduce enforceable home-school contracts that spell out both parents' and pupils' responsibilities. And we will give heads complete control over expulsion. If they decide to expel a disruptive pupil, they will not be second-guessed by an outside panel. </p> <p>Next, the police. As with every other public service, Labour has inundated the police with Whitehall targets, inspectorates and directives. Of course, the move towards centralisation did not start in May 1997. It has been happening gradually for decades. But top-down control has ballooned under this government. </p> <p>Under Labour, the National Policing Plan sets out five strategic priorities for the police. The Police Performance and Assessment Framework has 13 headline measures and 36 component measures. The police are overseen by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Audit Commission and a new Police Standards Unit. </p> <p>As Robert Peel, the founder of Britain's police force, said: \"The test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder - not the visible evidence of police action in dealing with it\".</p> <p>But David Blunkett's Policing Performance Assessment Framework requires the police to: \"measure the victims' ... of domestic burglary or violent crime ... satisfaction with the overall level of service provided\". But what the victims of burglary and violent crime want is to see the criminal who caused the crime caught, convicted and punished.</p> <p>David Blunkett's bureaucratic framework also sets out to measure the percentage of local people who think their police \"do a good job\". But people know if their police are doing a good job by the level of crime and disorder in their neighbourhood. </p> <p>It is not PR that people want, it is effective policing. </p> <p>Conservatives will give the police a simple, clear objective: \".... to prevent crime and disorder\". </p> <p>We need to police our streets - not de-police them. We need a police force which intervenes, confronts and challenges every kind of crime and disorder - from graffiti and litter to burglary and robbery. In short we need zero tolerance policing. </p> <p>As Ray has shown in Middlesbrough, and Rudi Guiliani showed in New York, by challenging disorder you begin to claim ground back from the yobs and hoodlums controlling our cities. You demonstrate that there is a line people cannot cross - and as police confidence rises in challenging unacceptable behaviour, so public confidence rises in the police. By challenging so-called small crimes head-on, you push back the burglars, car thieves and drug dealers responsible for so much of the crime in Britain today. </p> <p>Conservatives will cut away at the police paperwork that keeps policemen and women chained to their desks. And here's an example of what we don't do.</p> <p>The Macpherson report recommended that the police keep a record of every stop they make - and that anyone stopped by the police should be able to see a record of that paperwork. On average, it will take about seven minutes to fill in the paperwork for each individual stop.</p> <p>If a police officer saw a troublemaker on the high street, is he or she more likely to stop him if it means having to spend seven minutes filling in the paperwork back at the station? And imagine if it wasn't just one - but half a dozen? That's not just seven minutes - it's the best part of one hour. Would that police officer still stop those troublemakers? </p> <p>The government is about to launch further trials to implement this recommendation. Conservatives would not implement this recommendation.</p> <p>And Conservatives will support the police when it comes to stop and search. Increased stop and search is part of the solution to rising crime.</p> <p>Effective policing depends on stop and search. In response to the 9/11 disaster David Blunkett rightly gave the police new stop and search powers to deal with terrorism. At the time he described them as \"reasonable and proportionate\".</p> <p>Not surprisingly the police used those new powers. But no sooner had they done so than the government instigated an inquiry into their use. Politicians in Whitehall need to stop second guessing the police at every turn. </p> <p>And Conservatives will put more police back on our streets. We will massively increase police numbers across the country. The lesson of Guiliani's success in New Yorkis that you need to increase police numbers. </p> <p><b>Licensing Laws</b></p> <p>Everyone knows that a great deal of criminal behaviour is fuelled by alcohol. I am all in favour of people having a good time - and the creation of a caf\u00e9 culture is part of the process of regeneration in our towns and cities. But in many places what we're seeing isn't a caf\u00e9 culture - it's a yob culture. </p> <p>The government claims to have handed control over licensing to local councils. But as always with Labour, it's not real local control. For example, central government guidelines make it virtually impossible for local councils to turn down applications if they think there are already too many bars or clubs in an area. But local people must be able to say through their elected representatives \"enough is enough\" if they want to. Conservatives will give local councils real control over licensing in their area.</p> <p><b>Punishing Offenders</b></p> <p>When it comes to punishing offenders, we need to send a clear, unequivocal message to criminals - if you break the law you will be punished. </p> <p>Cautions should be for first time offenders - community penalties for less serious crimes. But persistent, violent and dangerous criminals should be sent to prison. The public needs protection from them. </p> <p>A hard core of criminals commit most of the crime in Britain today. If they are behind bars they cannot commit more crime.</p> <p><b>Prison</b></p> <p>Under Labour, prison building has not kept up with the rise in the prison population. As a consequence our prisons are over crowded. Prisoners are now being released early to cope with the problem - and the courts are increasingly unable to sentence persistent offenders to prison.</p> <p>As if this wasn't bad enough, Labour have set an arbitrary limit on the prison population in the UK. Ministers have said it must not rise above 80,000. This is an extremely dangerous approach - which will only store up problems for the future.</p> <p>Yes prison building costs money - but it is the first duty of government to protect the public. The best way to do that is to put serious, persistent and dangerous criminals behind bars. And it sends a powerful to message to those outside prison - crime doesn't pay.</p> <p>The cost to society of failing to take action is far greater than the cost of prison building itself.</p> <p>Conservatives will also end the government's dangerous early release scheme. </p> <p>It's not a question of if we build new prisons - it is a question of how many new prisons we build and what kind of prisons they are.</p> <p>And zero tolerance should apply just as much inside prison as on our streets. We will drug test all prisoners on arrival - and test them regularly throughout their sentence. </p> <p> Recent reports from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons suggest that drug testing in prisons is not being effectively implemented. And how many people know that when prisoners commit crimes against other inmates, they are rarely prosecuted. Why? If prisoners commit crimes they should be prosecuted. Failure to do so brings the law into disrepute.</p> <p>Finally, drugs. Despite increasing drug abuse, there are only 2,000 rehab places in the entire country. That's right just 2,000. All the evidence shows that people with a drug habit are more likely to kick it if they receive intensive treatment in a secure, residential clinic. So we will increase the number of rehab places to 20,000 - enough for every hard drug addict aged 16 to 24. </p> <p>Addicts will then face a choice - rehab or prison. And if you drop out of rehab you go straight to prison. There will be no second chances. If we are to get young addicts off the conveyor belt to crime we will need to be firm but fair.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>On November 201996 Ray Mallon was appointed Head of Crime Strategy for the Middlesbrough Division of Cleveland Police. That same day he pledged to cut crime by 20% within eighteen months or else resign. Ray exceeded his target within six months.</p> <p>Crime is still falling in Middlesbrough today.</p> <p>But across Britain crime is rising. People today fear crime. They know that the criminal justice system is moving in the wrong direction and that as a society we are under attack from values which put rights before responsibility. </p> <p>We need to make clear the difference between right and wrong. We need an end to the excuses for poor behaviour and crime. We need to stand up for the resolute, silent majority.</p> <p>Our society needs more discipline, decent values and respect. Respect for people, respect for property and respect for the neighbourhood. Today crime is at record levels, and under Labour, it will only get worse. </p> <p>By cutting police paperwork and political correctness, and putting more police on the beat, we can and we will make our streets safer. </p> <p>Why should people believe me any more than any other politician when I say this? Because I have some experience when it comes to cutting crime. </p> <p>Last month Tony Blair boasted that it was time to end the 1960s consensus on law and order. But the truth is I ended that consensus when I became home secretary in 1993. </p> <p>My approach was simple: to give the police the powers they needed to catch criminals; to give the courts the powers they needed to convict criminals; and to give our prisons the space to take persistent, serious and dangerous offenders out of circulation altogether. </p> <p>That approach worked. By 1997 when I left the Home Office, almost one million fewer crimes were being committed each year. I am proud of my record in cutting crime.</p> <p>I did not accept then and I do not accept now that rising crime is an inevitable fact of modern life. With decisive action and clear leadership, we can cut crime.</p> <p>But although I have a track record, I know that, to the silent, resolute and decent people who may read or hear these words, that will not be enough. Talk is cheap. </p> <p>People have had enough of personal crusades that last as long as a news bulletin. They want to know that, for a change, a politician means what he says, and will be prepared to take the rap if he fails.</p> <p>My fight against crime will not last for a news bulletin. It will last for five years.</p> <p>After five years, I will be happy to be judged on my record.</p> <p>As I showed when I was home secretary - and Ray Mallon has shown in Middlesbrough and Hartlepool- if you are resolute, if you are determined, if you have the will, you can cut crime.</p> <p>We are resolute, we are determined, we have the will. We will cut crime.</p>",
  "<p>The government today announced a campaign against the booming trade in counterfeit goods such as DVDs and perfumes, which deprives the UK economy of billions of pounds.</p> <p>Britain's first intellectual property crime strategy - which encompasses brand owners, police, trading standards and customs - involves sharing information and improving inter-agency coordination, improving the training of frontline staff, and an annual national enforcement report. </p> <p>\"Intellectual property crime is not victimless,\" Jacqui Smith, the industry minister, said. \"As well as cheating consumers, the trade in counterfeit goods costs UK companies billions of pounds and thousands of jobs every year. </p> <p>\"That is why we are working together with industry and law enforcement agencies to clamp down on this illegal trade.\"</p> <p>The new initiative comes amid an explosion in counterfeiting and piracy which is believed to have cost the British economy \u00a310bn and 4,000 jobs last year, according to Ruth Orchard, the director of the anti-counterfeiting group.</p> <p>All the major anti-piracy trade bodies are reporting a huge rise in the level of fake products being smuggled into the UK. The federation against copyright theft seized almost 1.8 million pirated DVDs last year - a rise of 405% cent on the previous year and one that deprived the film industry of \u00a3440m in lost revenue. </p> <p>Anecdotal evidence suggests blockbuster movies were available illegally long before their release date. The hit British film Love Actually was released last Christmas, but was sold illegally several months before. Anti-piracy organisations also believe that a boom in the number of websites and internet user groups devoted to selling illegal copies of CDs and movies indicates a growing problem. </p> <p>The British Phonographic Industry, which represents the major record labels, says commercial piracy is on the increase. </p> <p>Music piracy generated more than \u00a356m for counterfeiters each year, the BPI said, with the figure growing by 13% in 2003 - six times the rise in legitimate CD sales. However, even these estimates, which are based on seizures of counterfeit media, are thought to underplay the true extent of the problem. </p> <p>\"Counterfeiting is a massive problems for the recorded music industry,\" David Martin, the BPI anti-piracy director, said. \"A huge amount of investment goes into developing new acts, and piracy makes that investment that much harder. It's not the established acts that suffer the most at the hands of music pirates - it's the unsigned artists that rely on that investment.\" </p> <p>Fake branded products such as perfume and clothes still make up the lion's share of the counterfeit market. Trading standards officers, however, believe that a steep rise in the amount of pirated media smuggled into the country from Russia and Asia is becoming the fastest-growing area.</p> <p>\"Counterfeiting is a global business run by highly-organised serious criminals using it as a low-risk way of laundering money and raising funds for other criminal activities,\" Bryan Lewin, of the Trading Standards Institute, said. </p> <p>\"To tackle crime at this level, trading standards, the industry, and other enforcement agencies must adopt an equally organised and co-ordinated approach. The national intellectual property crime strategy will help to achieve this objective.\"</p>",

  "<b> In the house</b> <br> <p><b> True blue and . . . who?</b><br> </p> <p>Back in 1834, when Sir Robert Peel laid the foundations of the Conservative Party with the Tamworth manifesto, \"rebranding\" meant that your red-hot branding iron hadn't made a clear enough mark on the skin the first time round. One hundred and seventy years later, Peel's successors are considering changing the name of the party again. They may take comfort from the fact that although Sir Robert didn't call it rebranding, that was exactly what, in modern terms, it was. The Conservatives' precursors, the Tories - the name meant \"Irish cannibal\" or \"Irish robber\" - had suffered an electoral catastrophe under the Duke of Wellington, and needed a makeover. </p> <p>Many readers will consider the choice of a new name for a Conservative party desperate to recapture electoral success obvious - they should rename themselves \"the Labour party\" - but, conscientious as ever, the Guardian invited Wolff Olins, the consultancy responsible for rebranding Goldfish and Orange, to consider what name the Conservative party might flourish under. </p> <p>Some ideas suggest a certain lack of faith in the party's future. \"The HisTories\" is one, as are \"the New Con Party\" and the \"Fuck Me, No Votes, I'll Change My Name and Ensure Sod All Votes Next Time party\". Others are more nuanced: \"the Altruists\", \"the Die-Hard Party\", \"the In-Betweens\". </p> <p>It's hard to see most of the more serious attempts getting past the flagpole stage. \"The New Guard\" conjures up troubling visions of Oliver Letwin in a black uniform with epaulettes and gilt eagles; \"Conservative Life\" sounds like a lifestylesection for the Spectator; and \"Union for Progress\" like the kind of party a central Asian warlord might go for in the hope of respectability and nice jobs for his nephews. By the time voters had worked out the tricksy chronology of \"the Now, Tomorrow Party\", the polls would have closed. </p> <p>The most promising avenue, not surprisingly, involves dumping the tedious word \"party\" altogether and going for a single noun. Wolff Olins tread cautiously here. They suggest \"the Home party\". Why not just \"Home?\" Why not \"Happiness\"? Why not \"Love\"? \"Vote for Michael Howard! Vote for Love!\" On these grounds, the most successful suggestion would appear to be the simple \"Blue\": a pleasant word, with associations of sea and sky and, in the Tory case, blood, and quite meaningless. </p> <p>I have a suggestion. Given that the Conservative party is an old, crumbling property in desperate need of renovation, and given that its members are monarchists who believe they have an almost divine right to return to power, the solution is clear: replace Michael Howard with Griff Rhys Jones, and rename the party Restoration.<br> <b>James Meek</b> </p> <p><b> Society</b><br> </p> <p><b> Roadhogs, rejoice!</b><br> </p> <p>Not since Boudicca torched Verulamium in AD60 have the people of Hertfordshire got so hot under the collar. Well, that may not be true, but let's not spoil the story. Some residents of St Albans are livid, while others are experiencing a giddy glow of freedom. Why, you ask? Because since April 1 they have had no traffic wardens. But that's surely a good thing, you counter. Traffic wardens, after all, are just behind estate agents, lawyers and smug hacks in the list of people whose mass redundancy would add to human happiness. And, isn't it wonderful for drivers to experience the rare joy of dumping their motors wherever they want? </p> <p>Consider this recent letter to the Welwyn and Hatfield Times, about parking problems in Hitchin. \"When I politely asked drivers parked in disabled spots why they were parking there, I was invited to find some activity involving sex and travel simultaneously,\" wrote disabled motorist David Monck. \"Others simply asked, 'Who's going to book me then? There's no traffic wardens!'\" It's hard to know which is worse - the ill-conjugated verb or the contempt for law and order which is growing in parts of Hertfordshire. </p> <p>The problem reared its head in December 2002, when Herts Constabulary announced that by April this year it would stop providing traffic wardens in order to save \u00a31m and focus on crime targets. Local councils were called on to provide their own. Three have, though seven, including St Albans, had problems and were unable to provide warden services in time. Baffling phrases such as \"outsourcing\", \"best value\" and \"fast tracking\" have been used freely in official statements. The result has been a traffic-wardening interregnum in St Albans - a situation which even councillor Malcolm MacMillan, holder of the transport portfolio for the historic town's council, has called \"anarchic\". </p> <p>So is St Albans the best place in Britain to double-park your Range Rover? \"Not really,\" says Colin Connolly of Herts Constabulary. \"There is traffic enforcement going on, but it's being done by our probationary and community liaison officers for the time being. We appreciate it's a big job for councils and we'll provide them with help in the interim. You'd be making a big mistake if you think you can park anywhere you want in St Albans.\" You could always try Bishops Stortford.<br> <b>Stuart Jeffries</b> </p> <p><b> Media studies</b><br> </p> <p><b> The Mafia get medieval</b><br> </p> <p>History never wastes anything, and certainly not a good story. In tonight's episode of The Sopranos (at 10pm on E4, soon to be repeated on Channel 4), a new plot twist manages to make an elegant reference to medieval history. Carmela Soprano, wife of Mafia boss Tony, has taken a lover, an intellectual with a flat full of books (probably another thing that Carmela doesn't get at home). In an intimate scene, she visits the loo, only to discover that her paramour's preferred privy reading is an edition of the letters of the medieval lovers Abelard and Heloise. </p> <p>The Sopranos prides itelf on its literary qualities and its complexity. American critics laud the series' chief writer, David Chase, for his \"cross-referencing mythology\"; Tony Soprano has been compared to King Lear (his family falls apart as a result of his poor judgment when he suffers the sting of an ungrateful daughter) and Hamlet (he is confronted by the spectre of a dead member of the family). In one episode he manoeuvres the body of his latest victim through a deserted meat-packing factory only to find himself caught up in chains which he is obliged to drag behind him - just like Marley's ghost in A Christmas Carol. The historical reference to Abelard is not hard to decode: Peter Abelard, a medieval philosopher, had a passionate secret affair with his student, Heloise. When it was discovered, he was castrated: the lovers spent the rest of their lives communicating only by letter (it is the letters that made them famous). </p> <p>Abelard was not, as is frequently assumed, castrated as punishment for fornication, or even for heresy. He was the victim of Heloise's uncle Fulbert, with whom she lived and who, one assumes, was himself in love with his young niece. When Fulbert found them in bed together, jealous fury drove him, in Abelard's own words, to \"remove those parts with which I had offended\" - symbolically apposite, but gruesome. And there would, on reflection, be no better actor to portray evil uncle Fulbert than James Gandolfini, who plays Tony Soprano with such a compelling combination of vulnerability and viciousness.<br> <b>James Burge</b> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> James Burge's Heloise and Abelard is published by Profile Books, price \u00a38.99. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Filthy lucre</b><br> </p> <p><b> The bling revolution</b><br> </p> <p>A century ago Thorstein Veblen, in The Theory of the Leisure Class, defined \"conspicuous consumption\", and here it is at its most extreme: from a manufacturer called AWR Aquilla you can buy a wheel that costs \u00a3143,000, or three-quarters of a million for a set (if you insist on a spare). For this, you get diamonds inset into each of the 21 screws that attach coruscating spokes to a sparkling split-rim. Each wheel even has a GPS tracking device, for when the star-struck become the light-fingered. </p> <p>Cars are urban jewellery. And the most jewel-encrusted cars are the ones that move the smallest distances. Forty years ago, reporting on a hot-rodding event in California, Tom Wolfe said that for the generation of kids who populated drag strips, cars were power, sex, colour, money: all the symbolism of power and prestige. These Californian hot rods only travelled a quarter of a mile: they existed simply for the purposes of sexual display and social competition. </p> <p>A vigorous subculture has now grown up in Britain, a distant relative of the Californian hot-rodders. This is a group that is economically powerful, but socially and culturally dispossessed. So they make their own society and culture. Bored with the polite nostrums of the mainstream with its chaste Audis and I'm-on-the-board BMWs, they customise bland white-bread vehicles - Vauxhalls, Hondas, Citro\u00ebns - by creating baroque extravagances that are a stupefying rebuke to conventions of good taste. And they usually start with the wheels. </p> <p>Ever since cavemen, wheels have moved us, but in this world of garish metamorphic style they have a new significance. Designers know that the size of the wheel and its relationship to its arch is one of the most efficient ways of conveying semantic intent. Customisers know, because they are so easily changed, that wheels of increasingly exaggerated styles and dimensions are a fast-track to personal expression. Width and diameter are enlarged to provide the suggestion of brute power. Finishes become more ostentatious, to suggest a quasi-erotic dedication to surface effects. For the same reason that a south Los Angeles bro favours gold personal decoration, Astra owners in Southend choose dark chrome, 18-inch, seven-spoke alloy wheels. Like their \u00a3143,000 relatives, they have no protection from kerbing, but you were never meant to park jewels.<br> <b>Stephen Bayley</b></p>",

  "<p>FA ennui appears to have finally set in with just 3.1m viewers tuning into ITV's exclusive interview with Faria Alam last night.</p> <p>It means ITV is probably feeling short-changed having forked out \u00a3100,000 to hear Ms Alam tell her story of her controversial affair with the England football coach in front of the cameras.</p> <p>Like the Sunday newspaper interviews, Tonight concentrated on Ms Alam's affair with Sven-Goran Eriksson, with the toughest questions centring on Ms Alam's conduct rather than on the management of the Football Association.</p> <p>In the event the programme proved less popular than BBC1's Ten O'Clock News - and also the regular Monday night edition of Tonight, which went out at 8pm against EastEnders.</p> <p>ITV bosses rarely shell out as much for an interview - the most they have paid in the past was \u00a3200,000 for an interview with the parents of conjoined twins who were separated in a controversial operation in the UK. </p> <p>Before the broadcast, ITV bosses were confident they could recoup their investment through overseas sales although this remains to be seen.</p> <p>BBC1's Ten O'Clock News was watched by 5.4 million viewers and attracted a 27% audience share.</p> <p>Earlier in the evening, the regular edition of Tonight was watched by 4.1 million viewers and attracted an 18% audience share against EastEnders, which attracted 10.8 million.</p> <p>However, an extended 60-minute version of Sven and Me proved more successful - relatively speaking - for ITV2 from 11pm.</p> <p>Sven and Me on ITV2 was watched by 137,600 viewers, making the show the second most watched non-terrestrial programme during its timeslot, beaten only by CSI on Living.</p> <p>The earlier 10pm transmission of ITV1's Tonight was also up against the first episode of the second series of Channel 4's US detective drama Without a Trace, which is quietly developing into a nice little hit for the network.</p> <p>Without a Trace, about a team of FBI detectives, led by Anthony LaPaglia's Jack Malone, investigating missing person cases, was watched by 2.7 million viewers and attracted a 15% audience share.</p> <p>The drama is from blockbuster film producer Jerry Bruckheimer - the man behind Top Gun, Pearl Harbor and Pirates of the Caribbean - who also makes the hit CSI TV franchise.</p> <p>On BBC2 from 10pm, The Keith Barret Show concluded its run with 1.6 million viewers and an 8% audience share for an interview with Tony Wilson and his partner Yvette Livesey.</p> <p>Over on Channel Five, a repeat of Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Inferno attracted 1.9 million viewers and a 9% audience share between 9pm and 10.55pm.</p> <p>Elsewhere last night, BBC1's cold case detective drama, Waking the Dead, continued to dominate the 9pm ratings battle with ITV1.</p> <p>Last night's Waking the Dead attracted 8.2 million viewers and a 35% audience share, while on ITV1 Bad Girls had to settle for 5.4 million and a 23% share.</p> <p>Later on, Darcus Howe's polemical Channel 4 documentary about deteriorating relations between the UK's black and Asian communities, Who You Callin' a Nigger?, attracted a respectable 1 million viewers and 10% audience share between 11pm and midnight.</p> <p>The Channel 4 documentary was up against programmes including a repeat of ITV1's reality property show The Block, which also attracted 1 million viewers.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>The ongoing row over TV rights to horseracing escalated today after the owner of Newmarket and Aintree racecourses said it would mount a \"robust defence\" against a claim for \u00a351m in damages from BSkyB and Arena Leisure. </p> <p>Racecourse Holdings Trust, which operates 11 other courses including Epsom and Cheltenham, is also considering counter-suing AttheRaces, the racing channel owned by the gaming group Arena and the pay-TV broadcaster Sky, after it filed a high court writ yesterday seeking to recover \u00a351.3m. </p> <p>The two companies launched the original, ill-fated AttheRaces channel in 2001 with Channel 4, paying \u00a3307m for a 10-year deal with 49 of the UK's 59 courses. </p> <p>That agreement collapsed in March this year following a row over the profits from interactive betting, allowing the broadcasters to escape from a deal that they accepted was unlikely to make them money. </p> <p>Interactive betting revenues had proved slower to materialise than expected, and in April Arena wrote off \u00a349m of its investment in the channel. </p> <p>Channel 4 withdrew from the consortium, signing its own short-term deal for terrestrial coverage from Cheltenham and other courses, leaving Sky and Arena to relaunch the channel. </p> <p>However, the new channel was snubbed by RHT and other leading independent courses including Newbury and Goodwood, which opted to set up their own rival channel, Racing UK. </p> <p>Sky and Arena are determined to recover money that was paid up front to the courses, but RHT said it would mount a strong defence and was also considering a counter-claim based on the reasons for AttheRaces breaking the original deal. </p> <p>The writ had been expected for some time and is being seen as an attempt to force RHT to sign up to the newly relaunched AttheRaces channel. Sky and Arena said yesterday they would not sue any courses that had signed up to the new deal. </p> <p>AttheRaces is free to Sky subscribers while Racing UK, which is yet to launch, is planned as a subscription channel that will revert to free-to-air once it is profitable. </p> <p>RHT and its partners, representing 30 courses, argue that horseracing should take control of its own rights but another 29 courses, operated by other groups - including Northern Racing, GG Media and Ascot - have already signed deals with the new AttheRaces. </p> <p>In the aftermath of the AttheRaces collapse, there was much speculation over whether ITV would launch a raid for the jewels in the crown of the racing calendar such as the Grand National and Cheltenham. </p> <p>However, following negotiations, C4 signed for the rights to broadcast the Cheltenham Festival for a further 18 months while the BBC signed long-term deals to retain the Grand National and the Derby. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Desperate to drive into a lake? You'll be after a Gibbs Aquada, then. It's the world's first factory-produced, customer-ready, high-speed amphibian (or HSA) and represents a one-stop shop for all your car-dunking needs. True, you can get amphibious vehicles in kit form. And the military might be prepared to sell you something they've finished with. But they won't do 35mph across water and come with a stereo. And, in the case of the military vehicle, it may have had several hundred not particularly careful previous owners. </p> <p>Maybe you saw an Aquada in the papers recently when Richard Branson piloted a slightly reinforced, carefully branded one across the channel. Or perhaps one cut you up recently while you were water-skiing. Either way, the car is hard to miss. On land, it looks like a large sports car that has recently run over a boat. On water, it looks like a large boat that has recently run over a sports car. </p> <p>One afternoon last week I drove an Aquada on a series of standard road surfaces in Warwickshire, where it behaved exactly like a car. Then I plunged it into a lake near the Gibbs factory in Nuneaton, at which point it started acting like a speedboat - a speedboat powerful enough, moreover, to pull a water-skier. And at no point during its transition from one to the other was I required to leave my seat or, indeed, do anything more strenuous than arch my eyebrow and press a solitary rocker switch to the left of the steering wheel. </p> <p>There's no leaning over the side to haul in sheets and ropes, then. There is, in fact, no nautical business whatsoever. You simply ease the car into the wet and push the button. At which point, 10 years of work by Gibbs, involving the patenting of 60 new pieces of engineering, springs to life, causing the wheels to uncouple from the drive shaft and pivot up under the car's body, roughly in the manner of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. </p> <p>And when, seconds later, the light comes on to signal that the wheels are stowed, you are directly free to put your foot back on the pedal and resume your journey, only this time with a fetching plume of froth behind you. Ahoy there, indeed. </p> <p>Given the precedent set by chase scenes in countless blockbusting movies, it could prove tempting to take the car up to 80mph and burst off the end of a jetty, preferably with an exploding warehouse in the background. But for now, I'm afraid, the Aquada works best when given unhassled access to a gentle slipway. </p> <p>In any case, nosing the car on to a lakebound slope is a powerfully counterintuitive maneouvre which it proves hard to feel gung-ho about. Driving head first into water is so much the opposite of what you are taught to do by the people at BSM that you find yourself wrestling with your better judgment, right until the ectsatic moment when you feel the car adrift on the current and realise that it isn't going to sink like a box of rocks. </p> <p>Give the engine (a V6 from a Land Rover) enough revs, and you are soon skipping across the surface like a pebble and thudding heartily over the wash created by nearby wake-boarders, passing car containers and so forth. You can also pull some pretty fancy, rapid full-lock turns, to impress or irritate other water users. (Gibbs say they have never flipped one on the water, try as they might.) And when you've had enough, you merely approach the slipway, press the button, idle awhile, and then emerge with the car's bodywork, but not your own, dripping. </p> <p>There are hints, in the shape of that body, of a Mazda MX5 or MGF, with which the Aquada appears to share a studded aluminium petrol cap. Except that the Aquada is three seats wide, with the driver (or captain, as we should probably call him) occupying the centre, and the passengers slightly astern to port and starboard. </p> <p>Also, unlike your average sports model, the Aquada has no side or rear windows. Nor does it have any doorhandles, which turns out, on closer inspection, to be a direct consequence of its having no doors. You climb in over the sides, giving yourself a leg-up on the running board. </p> <p>The cockpit that confronts you is no different in feel from that of any regular automatic saloon car, except in having a greater than average provision of water-friendly fabrics. And I suppose no regular car that I know of comes with bilge pumps as standard, though given the amount of semi-liquid detritus flushing about on the floor of the average family vehicle, they might as well. </p> <p>All things considered, it may be possible to have more fun in a car than this, but I'm not sure how. One is aware, of course, that, at \u00a375,000, the Aquada is more of a rich person's plaything than a sensible solution to transport problems for island-dwellers. That said, Gibbs at one stage thought they were going to have to charge \u00a3150,000 for the Aquada. So you could say it is already half price. Bargain! And think of what you'll save on ferry tickets.</p>",
  "<p>Bernard Levin, one of the past century's most devastating journalistic scourges of establishments on the right or left, has died at the age of 75, it was announced yesterday. </p> <p>For some years, his acute mind, thunderous vocabulary and relish for laughter and long sentences had been increasingly silenced by Alzheimer's disease. He spent part of his last period in a specialist London hospital. </p> <p>One of Levin's friends, the journalist Simon Jenkins, called him \"a master of prose\" and said his writing had a touch of Voltaire. Last night another friend, Lord Rees-Mogg, editor of the Times when Levin was its star columnist, said, \"He was as brilliant a columnist as we have had in Britain since the last war\". </p> <p>Levin was brought up by his grandparents and mother after his father left home, and graduated in government from the London School of Economics. In his early career on the Spectator, he made a sensational impact as the first irreverent parliamentary sketchwriter. </p> <p>He savaged an aggressive Conservative government law officer, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller as \"Sir Reginald Bullingham-Manner\" and prophetically renamed Sir Hartley Shawcross, a Labour minister veering right, \"Sir Shortly Floorcross.\" </p> <p>As the Guardian's television correspondent, he covered ITV's opening night in the 1950s. He was in at the birth of the satire movement, cross-examining politicians on the TV series That Was the Week That Was. Later the Guardian asked him to write a freelance column. But, saying that he wrote better against the grain, he opted for the Times. There from 1971 onwards, though he grew more earnest and moved politically to the right, he could still be impartial in his indignation. </p> <p>In 1983, he wrote in the Times of Michael Foot's brief spell as Labour leader: \"The sight of Mr Foot hanging himself higher and higher and higher with every shifting, gaseous, unfinished verbless unintelligible sentence which he emitted like ectoplasm [... ] was so distressing that I switched off two-thirds of the way through: I felt like a member of Greenpeace watching a month old seal pup beating its own brains out.\" </p> <p>Towards the end of his time as a writer, in June 1995, he said of Michael Howard as Conservative home secretary: \"In Howardspeak, 'Howard to close migrant loopholes' means Howard needs another boost for his ambition, as odious as it is ridiculous, so he plays the immigration card: unwanted darkies, brownies, yellowies, even whities, out, out, out. The card, of course, is not just for him alone, but for the Tories in general, as they look at the polls and sink more and more into despair.\" </p> <p>A thread which ran through Levin's 1980s Times columns was the crushing of liberty in the Soviet Union. Lord Rees-Mogg, who is on holiday in Portugal, told the Guardian: \"I think he did have very considerable influence.He was always on the side of liberty and, in domestic affairs, of justice. </p> <p>\"He was critical of establishments, whether the old establishment of the right or the Harold Wilson/trade union establishment of the left. He loved long sentences, and could handle them in a way no one else could in our time.\"</p>",
  "<p>One in four employers do not believe it is worth spending money on training a pregnant worker, even though refusing to train an employee because she is pregnant is against the law, according to a new survey published today. </p> <p>Most firms have a positive attitude to pregnancy in the workplace and said they supported female staff who became pregnant. </p> <p>But the poll of 450 employers by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) also showed that 28% did not believe it was worth training someone who was pregnant. </p> <p>A similar number could not cite any of the statutory entitlements covering pregnancy such as maternity leave or time off to attend antenatal appointments. </p> <p>Managers said the most difficult issues to manage centred on whether a woman would return to work and on planning cover during maternity leave. </p> <p>Jenny Watson, deputy chairwoman of the EOC, said: \"Many organisations do handle pregnancy positively and as a result see business benefits, such as better retention rates and increased productivity. </p> <p>\"Yet the results of our new research suggest that significant numbers of employers have limited knowledge of the law, which may be preventing them from managing pregnancy effectively. </p> <p>\"Practical issues, such as arranging maternity cover, can also present problems for employers who want to treat pregnant employees fairly - but both large and small employers have told us that these practical difficulties can be overcome, or at least minimised, through good planning and dialogue,\" Said Ms Watson.</p> <p>The survey was conducted as part of the EOC's investigation into pregnancy discrimination in the workplace. </p> <p>Dianah Worman, diversity adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: \"After well over a quarter of a century of legislation to protect women from discrimination, and new legislation in the 1990s to protect pregnant workers, these figures show how deep-seated discrimination is, and how difficult it is to overcome. </p> <p>\"In a tight labour market, employers are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain suitably skilled staff. Training is recognised as one way you can hang on to people who might otherwise leave. </p> <p>\"Employers choosing not to train loyal and experienced staff because they are pregnant risk losing them to competitors. </p> <p>\"Not offering training to pregnant staff is bad business. It could reduce the commitment of staff to the organisation, mean you get less from your people, lower retention rates and make it more difficult to recruit replacements for the people you drive away.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry said: \"This research shows that most good employers are committed to giving pregnant employees a fair deal at work. We welcome the EOC's consultation and look forward to their final report.\" </p>",

  "<p>Tony Blair has laid out a five-year plan for schools that will mean the \"best schools\" will be able to abandon the shackles of local-authority control, and pay teachers according to the market. The Conservative party has similar proposals to allow all schools freedom from LEAs. Both parties are promising parents the chance to choose the best school for their child.</p> <p>There seems to be little to separate the two parties, apart from the issue of selection. Blair is against it; Michael Howard, the Tory leader, wants to give secondary schools the power to choose their own pupils.</p> <p>I believe the Labour party has dug itself into a big hole in this regard over the past 30 years. During the 1960s it introduced the comprehensive system. In most boroughs grammar schools were abolished. Yet, three decades on, it is unnerving to see that most of the cabinet are either public-school educated or from grammar schools.</p> <p>Isn't it disturbing to see that very few comprehensive pupils, especially ones from working-class backgrounds, have made their mark on society? Look at the upper echelons of the BBC, or the media, or the legal system, and you will see that they are dominated by people from public schools and grammars. It is even more worrying to see two public school boys - Tony Blair and Charles Clarke - dictating education policies. And it is positively alarming to note that the prime minister himself sends his children to a school that is in effect selective.</p> <p>\"Faith-based\" schools such as the London Oratory can select pupils on the basis of their religious orientation. In practice, this means that headteachers can interview children and glean much information about their academic abilities as well as their commitment to a faith. \"Faithbased\" school is code for \"selective\" school, for those in the know.</p> <p>Blair is telling parents to send their children to the local non-selective comprehensive, yet he and his family are benefiting from the opposite system. I am a parent who lives in London. I also work at a state-funded secondary school, which is losing its ability to select pupils because of Labour party policies. The school interviews pupils and judges them on seven criteria, including extracurricular interests and belief in a Christian ethos.</p> <p>The bottom line is that the headteacher is looking for pupils who are bright and articulate - whatever their background. Because the school is nearly 500 years old, and was based in Mile End Road until the 1970s, it has seen its remit as being to educate children from many areas in the east end. It is now based in the leafy suburb of Upminster, but serves a very wide catchment area.</p> <p>Teaching at the school has made me aware how important it is for highly intelligent children to learn in a friendly, intellectual environment.</p> <p>Unfortunately, my experience has been that clever children can often - but not always - become disaffected in classrooms where there are a lot of kids who are struggling with the curriculum. There's no one to compete with. In such contexts, it's much easier for clever kids to switch off and think up intelligent scams for winding up the teacher. In non-selective schools I have taught in I have seen quite a few very bright pupils - boys in particular - give up entirely.</p> <p>In my school, where results are among the best in the country, boys achieve at more or less the same level as the girls, because the competitive atmosphere to succeed spurs them on. Such levels of achievement among boys are unheard of in most comprehensives. Seeing this has made me think that perhaps cities like London could benefit from schools that select according to ability. The trouble is, many cities like London are tremendously polarised. Adhering to a non-selective system has created ghettoisation in urban schools. Many are dominated by one social or ethnic group. Giving schools the power to select pupils is a good way round this: it means a mix of pupils from different backgrounds can be achieved. </p> <p>Ironically, it is the non-selective system, whose champions pride themselves on being so inclusive, that is the most divisive. </p> <p>Why should the prime minister be one of the very few people who has the opportunity to send his children to a state-funded school that is selective in all but name?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Francis Gilbert's I'm A Teacher, Get Me Out Of Here is published by Short Books</p>",
  "A pensioner from Lowestoft is to hand back her MBE in protest at the government's failure to stem rising discrimination against Gypsies. <p>Kit Sampson, 80, was awarded an MBE 14 years ago after spending decades touring the country providing healthcare for the Traveller community. </p> <p>But she said yesterday she was \"ashamed\" of the honour, because of the government's continued refusal to reintroduce a legal duty for councils to provide official sites for Gypsies. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), the Commission for Racial Equality and even the residents of Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, who have campaigned against a site in their village, have all called for reform to compel councils to provide sites. </p> <p>Ms Sampson said she was dismayed at the lack of progress, with the government allowing ancient prejudices to fester and grow. She is returning her MBE to John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, who has refused to address the issue of Gypsies' accommodation in the new housing bill. </p> <p>The government is letting local prejudices take over, she said, adding that it is not acting compassionately. </p> <p>\"I've wept when I've read and seen these things in Cottenham. It is exactly the same as it was 30 years ago and in Victorian times. The phrase 'ethnic cleansing' has come in and that is exactly what it is. </p> <p>\"A councillor once said to me: 'It is a pity we haven't still got ovens we could put them in and burn them.' These comments aren't made in jest; they are what people feel deep inside. They haven't got room for the Gypsies. They've been regarded as outsiders since time immemorial, yet a lot of them have been here longer than us.\" </p> <p>Ms Sampson, who still regularly visits Travellers in prison, began working with Gypsies 40 years ago when she saw an advert in the local paper. \"It said, 'Help wanted. Urgent social problem. No pay. No thanks,' and that's exactly what it was,\" she recalled. </p> <p>An environmental health inspector had placed the advert, hoping for help to prevent the forcible relocation of a Gypsy camp. Ms Sampson pleaded with the local council to let them stay, then volunteered for Save the Children, providing mobile healthcare and immunisations for Gypsies and travelling to provide support at gatherings. She later worked as a Gypsy liaison officer for a local health authority. </p> <p>\"When I got my MBE I wasn't too keen on accepting it because it was from Margaret Thatcher, but my husband pointed out it wasn't really for me but for the role and the work. A Traveller came to the palace with me when I got it. The Queen almost took a step backwards when I said who I'd brought.\" </p> <p>Ms Sampson first tried to return her MBE in 1994 when the Criminal Justice Act removed the obligation on councils to provide site for Gypsies. But her local MP persuaded her to take it back when Labour came to power. </p> <p>She then had a personal meeting with Tony Blair, who assured her Gypsies would be treated fairly by New Labour. </p> <p>\"We talked and he said he would make sure Travellers were always treated compassionately.\" </p> <p>But now Ms Sampson is returning her MBE to Mr Prescott. \"I cannot accept my MBE from a government that is discriminating against a group in a way which means children don't have access to education and men and women and children don't have access to healthcare. This government is exactly the same as the last one.\" </p> <p>The Gypsy and Traveller Law Reform Coalition yesterday said they would report a council leader to the local government ombudsman after he praised residents in Epping who erected barricades to prevent two Traveller families from moving on to land they owned.</p>",
  "<p>The end of the second world war, and the building of the New Jerusalem: in the histories, the two morph seamlessly into one another. Hindsight records the elision as seemingly inevitable. But for those living through the period, that was never quite the way it felt. History was altogether more personal. War was more about doing one's duty, looking out for one's fellow soldiers, sailors and airmen - not to mention friends and family - and hoping one would come through unscathed, rather than about some grander moral purpose.</p> <p>When the servicemen and women were demobilised, it was their own fractured lives and relationships they were primarily concerned with rebuilding. It was a time of hope and uncertainty: hope that after six years of fighting, their lives could be rebuilt; uncertainty that they had the wherewithal to do it.</p> <p>How do you start again? This was a question that both government and individuals had to answer. What you need in time of war is not what you need in time of peace. With this in mind, the government introduced the Further Education and Training Scheme to allow war veterans easy access to university; entrance requirements were waived, grants were offered and two-year degrees established.</p> <p>Not everyone wanted a place at university: some felt their moment had passed, that they had experienced too much. And not all those who wanted a place could get one, as six years of entry had to be shoehorned into one or two.</p> <p>But for those who did, the experience was often life-changing. Many went back to study something completely different to what they might have done had war not broken out. Virtually all took their courses more seriously. This was the moment to make up for lost time. It was also the moment when many of the old hierarchical structures between academics and students began to break down. The ex-servicemen were that much older, that much more experienced than previous generations of students and were not going to be bound by petty restrictions. Unlike many of the academics, who could only read about history, this generation had helped to write it.</p> <p>The ex-servicemen interviewed on these pages are unwilling to make many claims for their achievements. Their stories have been lost in the wider social histories of the time, and their pathfinding for the students of the 50s and 60s has largely gone unheralded. But it is not too much to say that this generation changed the nature of the modern university.</p> <p><strong>Alastair Mundy-Castle, 81, taught at Harvard and was professor of psychology at Lagos University. He lives in South Africa</strong></p> <p>I was at school in Tonbridge when the war broke out. I tried to join the RAF as a 16-year-old in 1939, but was too young. I remember the excitement as I watched the Battle of Britain being fought in the skies over Kent and in 1940 I applied to the RAF again and was accepted for initial training.</p> <p>It was a strange period. I was first sent to Iceland, then Canada, before ending up in Georgia in the US. It took a while to get posted back to Britain, and then I was sent to South Africa to become a flying instructor for the Empire Training Scheme. Death was accepted as part of the deal, even at training school. When someone died, everyone got drunk and played games of hurling ourselves on top of one another. When we sobered up, it was back to normal.</p> <p>At the end of my stay in South Africa I got married, and my wife and I returned to Britain in January 1948. My time in the RAF had brought me into contact with many different types of people, and I was keen to study psychology. I didn't have a career in mind, just a tremendous thirst for knowledge. If the war hadn't come along, I'm not sure I'd have bothered with university as an 18-year-old: I was rather wild then and I had visions of going to India to become a pearl diver.</p> <p>I was a rather serious student when I went up to Cambridge in October 1948. Partly, this was because I had to live out of Magdalene College as a married man, and partly because I was very conscious of making up for lost time. Most of my friends were ex-servicemen and we all felt like that. I only went out on a Friday or Saturday, and college dinners were much grander than anything I had come across before.</p> <p>We did have fun, though. Cambridge was a beautiful place and so relaxing after everything I had been through. I played rugby and squash and loved sitting by the river, chatting to Michael Blair, one of Wittgenstein's philosophy students. We would discuss Freud, Adler and art in the earnest way that students do. I enjoyed every minute - so much so I went on to make a career out of it.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Lever, 83, from Bolton, retired after a career as a land agent. He lives in Malvern</strong></p> <p>I was accepted for Christ's Cambridge as a result of the matriculation exams I sat when I was 16, and went up in 1938 to read science. It was an odd choice as I was intending to become a priest.</p> <p>I didn't work at all hard and no one pushed me to do so. Most of my first year was spent hanging around with a scholar from Caius who was much wealthier than me, going on the river in the morning, eating strawberry mash and watching trains in the afternoon.</p> <p>My tutor, the novelist CP Snow, rather liked me and gave me a special at the end of the first year, which meant I could stay up to do an ordinary degree, but I rather think I would have failed that, had I stayed on. I still have many of the textbooks from that time on my bookshelves. And they're still unread.</p> <p>We all knew there was a war coming in 1939, but I tried not to let that interfere with my life too much, and spent the summer of that year playing tennis and restoring my mother's cottage.</p> <p>But you couldn't totally ignore the war. I had joined the Territorial Army in 1938 and in July 1939 I was sent on a short course for junior officers at Sandhurst. I was mobilised on the day before war was declared.</p> <p>It seems strange to admit it, but the early days of the war were rather fun. I was in the 5th Royals, which was initially an infantry regiment but soon switched to motorbikes, which I enjoyed immensely. I only stopped riding my old Triumph when I was in my late 70s.</p> <p>I became frustrated at my lack of promotion and applied to join the RAF. I was assigned to the Observer Corps. This, too, was fun while we were flying Sunderlands, but when the squadron was switched to Blenheims I became terribly airsick. I was sent to become an instructor.</p> <p>This was fine for a while, but I soon felt worthless. It seemed as if I was teaching aircrews things they already knew. I couldn't handle the lack of responsibility and had a breakdown, and was sent to the brand new psychiatric unit at Guy's Hospital in London.</p> <p>I was invalided out of the war in 1944 and went back to Cambridge later that year to read agriculture and estate management. The only condition imposed on me by Christ's was that I couldn't have a room in college, as I was told they didn't want to run the risk of the embarrassment of a suicide in the building.</p> <p>The five-year gap had left a marked change of attitude. During the war, I had learnt to work and I basically got my head down. I did play some bridge in the evenings, but as all my partners were eventually sent down, even that pleasure went by the wayside. The other change in me was that before the war I had been very High Church: by the end I had lost my taste for it entirely. I'm not sure why exactly.</p> <p>In 1944 most of the undergraduates were crocks, such as myself, who had been invalided out of the services and we tended to stick together. There were a few younger cadets, on six-month secondments before joining up, but they were there for such a short time I never really got to know them.</p> <p>The ethos of the university had also changed. We were all looking forward to the future, towards building our careers. We didn't want to look back. On VE day I had my head buried in books revising for exams and on VJ day I was inspecting potato crops.</p> <p><strong>Laurence Harbottle, 80, is still a partner in his London law firm</strong></p> <p>I was at school at the Leys in Cambridge, and we were evacuated to Pitlochry in 1940 when Addenbrookes Hospital took over the school. I enlisted with the Royal Regiment of Artillery in Scotland on an army con trick: they took me under age and sent me to Durham University for six months. I learnt about fuels and explosives by day and did some army training in the evening.</p> <p>The regiment then sent me to an officer training unit and I spent two years on active service at various camps around England as a 2nd lieutenant. In early 1944 the regiment was split up and the officers were sent to organise the embarkation contingent for D-day at Felixstowe. Afterwards we were posted to India and were on the point of chasing the Japanese out of Malaysia when the war ended. We then did some peace-keeping on the north-west frontier in the run-up to independence, before being sent home and demobilised in 1947.</p> <p>I never had a career plan, either before or after the war. I flirted with the idea of becoming an actor, but I settled for studying law. I thought I should do something useful: I had taken five years out of my life doing what other people wanted me to do, and I felt the need to make up for the time I had lost.</p> <p>Being accepted at Emmanuel in 1948 was surprisingly easy - just a couple of letters and an informal interview. I think the master of the college had good connections with my former English teacher. Cambridge itself was a novelty. The 1950s are often thought of as a time of austerity and deprivation, but it didn't feel that way to me. Maybe I just wasn't much of a sybarite: I still remember the stir that Kenneth Tynan caused when he came to visit from Oxford in his purple suit.</p> <p>There were schisms. Some of the older lecturers seemed to be slightly at a loss for not having been part of the war and felt inferior to the returning warriors, while many of the younger lecturers had fought alongside the student ex-servicemen and this created a mutual respect and bond between us.</p> <p>My time in the army had made me very adaptable, and I just got on with life. I was living in digs, and wore my demob suit to lectures almost every day. I'm not sure that everyone knuckled down in the way I did: the younger students seemed to have much more fun, but I was just busy getting a degree.</p> <p>It was all rather tame in some ways. I'd learnt to obey the rules so that's what I did. We all had to be in at certain times - the college doors were closed at 10pm - and I was never locked out. We were all very controlled and conformist at heart, I suspect. The real revolutionaries were the students who came after us.</p> <p><strong>Bob Brow (main picture), 80, is the former head of a mission group in Canada. He lives in Ontario</strong></p> <p>At the start of the war I was at Stowe, and during the Battle of Britain my parents called me out to join them in India. It was a long and dangerous journey and one or two of the escort ships were sunk, though I was more concerned about my girlfriend on board than the threat of torpedoes. I was 16 when I arrived in Karachi, and I spent the next two years at Aitchison College, Lahore. I was supposed to be completing my education, but the most important lesson seemed to be learning how to ride a polo pony.</p> <p>I was called up into the Yorks and Lancs regiment seven days after my 18th birthday, and was sent for officer training at Bangalore as the Indian army urgently needed officers in Burma. It was a job with a high death rate as the officers were picked off by the Japanese, and several of my friends were killed. More by luck than anything else, I was selected as a small arms instructor for the Mahratta Light Infantry. My last posting was as adjutant of my battalion in Java.</p> <p>As we came back to India early in 1947 I wondered what I would do when I was demobilised. To my astonishment I heard that the government would pay all my expenses to study at the university of my choice. I thought of a business career and was accepted at the London School of Economics. But when I wrote to my school principal, JF Roxburgh, at Stowe, he answered: \"My Dear Robert, I put you down for Trinity College, Cambridge on the basis of your school certificate, and if you write to Mr Sandbach, you will find you have a place there.\"</p> <p>Early in October 1947 I went into digs on Jesus Lane, and found myself eating in the Great Hall at Trinity. Bertrand Russell used to sit at the high table, except when he knew he would be the senior don and required to say the three-minute grace in Latin. But otherwise it was hardly different from eating in the regimental mess.</p> <p>We all got on well - both the ex-servicemen and the undergraduates straight from school - and Cambridge was certainly a happy place to be. We were all quite serious, though, and one of my tutors did comment that he had never had such a hard-working group. Once a week I had to present an essay for discussion with my economics tutor. That was a wonderful, mind-opening experience, but I did find it hard to keep up after so long away from academia.</p> <p>During my years in the army I was an atheist. In my first week at Trinity I was persuaded to go a meeting of the Christian Union (CICCU), and next morning I bought a Bible, which I had never read before. My conversion was instant and my new friends encouraged me into a very different lifestyle from the heavy drinking and smoking of five years in the army. I am now 80 years old and would have been dead long ago if I had continued on my previous course.</p> <p><strong>Fred Jarvis, 79, is former general secretary of the National Union of Teachers. He lives in London</strong></p> <p>My parents lived in West Ham and I was evacuated to Weymouth almost as soon as the war started, but nothing much seemed to be happening so we moved back to the East End. The very first bomb of the Blitz landed in the next street to us when I was on my way back from school.</p> <p>My father worked on the docks and he was transferred to Birkenhead, so I finished my education at Oldershall Grammar school in Wallasey. I wanted to stay on at school after 16, but my parents didn't have the money so I got a job in the education department and acted as a fire-watcher for the Home Guard in my spare time.</p> <p>I was called up to the 75th Highland Artillery regiment in 1943 and my active service began on D-day +4 when we were landed at Ouistreham. After the fall of Caen, we followed the German retreat through France, Belgium and Holland and my last active service was shelling Bremen in 1945.</p> <p>During my time in Wallasey I had been active in the Progressive Youth unit, and after the war ended I was put in charge of running various groups for German youngsters. At roughly the same time I was offered a scholarship from Ruskin College, which I planned to take up after I left the army.</p> <p>However, it was suggested I do a two-year social science course at Liverpool University, so I applied and was offered a place under the war veterans' access scheme. In August 1949 I got a call from St Catherine's College, Oxford, to say someone had dropped out and, as a result, I was admitted on a two-year PPE [politics, philosophy and economics] shortened honours course.</p> <p>The war had taken four years out of my life, so I took my studies rather seriously. I wanted to make up for what the war had cost me. Most of those who went up to Oxford at the same time as me were ex-servicemen, and my impression was we all felt the same way.</p> <p>I had always been a political animal and gravitated to those with similar views; but, even so, it did feel as if everyone took their responsibilities more seriously than they do now. Freedom had been hard fought for, and no one took it for granted. I stood as a Labour candidate for Wallasey in 1951 and became president of the National Union of Students in 1952; even Rupert Murdoch was in the Labour club.</p> <p>None of us talked much about the war: maybe we were a more reserved generation, or maybe we were just all so determined to look forward and build something new.</p> <p>I do think the character of Oxford changed as a result of the war. Because we were much older than the usual undergraduates, we tended to look on many of the academics as equals. Many of the barriers between students and academics broke down at this time, and some of the old petty rules and traditions passed into history.</p> <p>The war certainly changed my life. If it hadn't come along, I doubt I'd ever have gone to university at all.</p> <p><strong>Peter Green, 79, is the Dougherty Centennial professor emeritus of classics at the University of Texas at Austin. He lives in Iowa</strong></p> <p>I was at Charterhouse during the Battle of Britain and an oil bomb exploded 30 yards from my study, but my memory of the time was that the war was peripheral to my life at school.</p> <p>In 1942 I won a major open scholarship in classics to Trinity, Cambridge, but I wanted to join the RAF before taking it up. Curiously, I did my initial training in Cambridge itself and, unusually for a public schoolboy, enlisted as a Non Commissioned Officer (NCO). I was detailed to be aircrew but was passed unfit after contracting double pneumonia, and I was packed off to the operations room of Fighter Command.</p> <p>I saw out the end of the war in the far east, where I became acquainted with Paul Scott, who went on to become both a successful novelist and my agent. Thankfully, some of the more bizarre plans - such as landing a glider on the top of a hill in Mandalay - were never put into action, and I survived the war.</p> <p>Going up to Cambridge in 1947 didn't require major readjustments: being in the far east during the war had been so different, it was simply another world that never impinged on life in England.</p> <p>What the war did do was make my time at Cambridge even more enjoyable than it might otherwise have been. I'd grown up very quickly and, as an NCO, I'd already gone through the love affair with alcohol that so often takes up so much of an ex-schoolboy undergraduate's time, energy and money.</p> <p>Since a large proportion, not only of my fellow students, but also of my teachers, were ex-service, there was little sense of strangeness - classics had more than its share of wartime luminaries: Nick Hammond, Geoffrey Kirk, Maurice Balme, et al - and anyway, as I recall, we never talked about it: there was a strong sense of looking forward rather than back, of catching up on lost time.</p> <p>One of my best friends among the dons, John Raven, had been a conscientious objector: I admired his integrity, there was no sense at all of uncrossable divides. The only split I recall was when the Conservatives were running Air Marshal Tedder as a candidate for the chancellorship of the university, and Harry Sandbach asked me why there was this prejudice among the students against generals, admirals, air-marshals: \"Because we had to serve under them,\" I said.</p> <p>It's interesting that though the food shortages were still acute I don't recall being bothered by them: this may have been because I'd returned from the far east with a passion for curry, and if there was one thing Cambridge had and to spare - cynics said it went with a sudden shortage of cats - it was curry.</p> <p>One reason I had for sitting the (very tough) University Scholarship exams in classics was because the financial benefits were non-taxable: the proceeds could go on good wine as well as good books. We were most of us living on the proverbial shoestring, and I don't think anyone I knew owned a car.</p> <p>My experiences sharpened my passion for Greek and Roman antiquity, the study of which I found exhilaratingly civilised by comparison with what was going on around me, and shed a very clear light on contemporary problems. Unlike some, I never for one moment considered changing my field of study because of anything I had experienced during the war.</p> <p>Back in 1942, I was something of a fla\u00e2neur - clever and idle, and I'd probably have settled for a job teaching classics at a provincial university. Being away broadened my horizons, and the war concentrated my mind. From then on I was more focused and worked hard.</p> <p>I did find the older generation of Cambridge classicists in many ways inhibiting, and I'm sure they found me peculiarly irritating; but my postwar Cambridge experience still remains with me as one of the defining, and intensely enjoyable, experiences of my life.</p> <p><strong>Edward Drake, 83, retired in 1976 after a career in advertising. He lives in Warwickshire</strong></p> <p>I was working for Cadbury's in Birmingham when war broke out. My father had wanted me to go to university, but I'd seen my friends leave school and get jobs and I wanted to do the same. I wasn't that academic - or that well-behaved for that matter - so the headteacher was happy to get rid of me.</p> <p>I volunteered in 1941 and joined the Royal Army Ordnance Corps - later the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers - and spent three years out in Alexandria. But by 1944 I felt further from the war in Egypt than the people back home, so I applied for a commission to join the infantry, and was accepted into the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry.</p> <p>After various detours through Palestine and Italy, I found myself fighting in north-west Europe. I was wounded on May 1, starting the last action before VE day near Lubeck. It was my own fault, really. You're always taught not to underestimate the enemy's strength, and I thought we were being pinned down by a single sniper from a signal box near the railway. It turned out to be a whole company of Panzer grenadiers and I was badly shot in the arm. That was the end of my war.</p> <p>Back home I realised what a chump I had been to have missed out on going to university before the war. Cadbury's had kept my job open and were happy for me to study for a degree. I decided I wanted to read French, as my languages had improved somewhat during my time in France and Belgium.</p> <p>I applied first to St John's College, Cambridge, and was turned down flat. I was told I had had my opportunity before the war. Luckily, the tutor at Downing took a different view. He saw the cast on my arm and offered me a sherry and a place.</p> <p>It was extremely daunting going back to academic study after so long away. My supervisor, FR Leavis, gave me a huge reading list and I did my best to work my way through it. It was always something of a struggle to keep up, though.</p> <p>There was a difference between us ex-servicemen and those who were fresh out of school. We all got on together, but I did tend to stick with the older age group. We had so many experiences in common, and often after dinner we would get together and discuss our lives in the war - or swap lies. I think we all felt rather sorry for those who were younger, as they didn't have our confidence to ignore the petty rules. One ex-serviceman was asked to turn his radio down: he wasn't asked again. After all we had been through, we weren't going to be treated like children.</p> <p>One particular experience sums up the difference between the two groups. Our JCR had decided to hold a May Ball, but the Master told us the college was not able to guarantee the expenditure involved. In the pre-war days, that would have been the end of the matter. However, our chairman asked what figure was necessary for the ball to go ahead. The JCR then wrote to former members of the college asking them to guarantee a sum, and the ball was a huge success.</p>",
  "Iraq's rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr vowed yesterday to stay in Najaf \"until the last drop of my blood is spilled\" as his militia fought gun battles across the country, including in Basra where a British soldier was killed and fiveothers were wounded. <p>The soldier died after two military Land Rovers were set alight and Mr Sadr's militiamen fired rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) at their patrol. </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence said British forces were attempting to calm the situation and avoid actions which might lead to an escalation in violence. </p> <p>\"There have been a number of incidents within the British area of operations in and around Basra,\" said an MoD spokesman. \"We regret we can confirm that a British soldier has been killed and there have been a number of other casualties. </p> <p>\"The situation is being brought under control, and whilst we continue to maintain our non-escalatory posture, we use force where necessary in self-defence.\" </p> <p>Fighting also spread to the southern city of Diwaniya, where militia were said to have surrounded the police station. In Sadr City, the eastern slums of Baghdad where Mr Sadr's movement is particularly well supported, the Iraqi government imposed a night-time curfew. </p> <p>In Najaf the young cleric defied a five-day onslaught by the US military to appear in public for the first time since launching his latest uprising. </p> <p>As his militia fought in the streets around him, Mr Sadr was led into a thickly carpeted room inside the Imam Ali shrine in the heart of the old city. There, before a stylised portrait of his revered father, he committed himself to a bitter fight against the US. </p> <p>\"I am staying in Najaf and I will not leave,\" he said. \"I am here as a defender of Najaf. I will stay until the last drop of my blood is spilled.\" </p> <p>In the streets outside, his militia, the Mahdi army, fired RPGs at American positions. US marines returned fire with heavy machine guns. </p> <p>\"I told the Mahdi army they are my brothers,\" said the cleric. \"They should call this the honest resistance. We are defending Islam.\" </p> <p>In April the 30-year-old led a series of violent uprisings across southern Iraq, the first time the Shia fought against the occupation. </p> <p>Eventually he struck a deal with the US military to end the conflict, but last Thursday that truce was broken, and fighting has raged since then in Najaf and elsewhere. </p> <p>Iraq was forced to stop oil production from its southern oilfields yesterday for the first time since the hand-over of power to Iraqi authorities in June, because of threats to sabotage the Basra-based state Southern Oil Company's operations. </p> <p>\"Pumping from the southern oilfields to storage tanks at Basra was stopped today after threats made by Sadr,\" an official told Reuters. \"It will remain stopped until the threat is over.\" </p> <p>The spectre of sabotage sent oil prices on the world's futures markets to record levels. The cost of Brent crude futures was pushed more than $1 higher to $41.65 and US light crude futures rose to $44.97, prompting fears that rising energy costs could derail global economic recovery. </p> <p>Mr Sadr has refused to take part in Iraq's political process, although he appears to be preparing to contest the elections which are due to be held next January. </p> <p>He said he wanted the Iraqi government put in charge of the US-led multi-national forces. \"When I see the Americans under their command, I will take part in their elections,\" he said. \"Now I am the enemy of America from now until judgment day.\" </p> <p>Mr Sadr's presence in the Najaf shrine yesterday and the position of hundreds of his fighters throughout the old city suggested he remains in a stronger position than the US military has so far admitted. The cleric has ignored several ultimatums to withdraw. </p> <p>US commanders claim they have killed 360 militiamen, but there is no evidence to sup port this. </p> <p>Hussein Hadi, the deputy director of Najaf's main hospital, said yesterday that 23 people had been killed since the fighting started last week and 98 had been injured, mostly civilians. Among the dead were five Iraqi police and four Iraqi army soldiers, he said. The Mahdi army treats its injured away from the hospital. </p> <p>In Najaf's main police station officers showed off a room crowded with around 300 Mahdi army prisoners, each sitting cross-legged and facing the wall. In one corner there were several plastic water bottles filled with urine. Before they opened the door the sound of screaming had been coming from inside. </p> <p>Ghalib al-Jazairy, Najaf's police chief, admitted several of the captives were policemen from stations in Basra and Amara, who had joined the militia. He said police had arrested 1,200 people in the past week, but half had already been released. </p> <p>\"We have the law on our side and we will find anyone who doesn't respect the law,\" he said. </p> <p>On Sunday, Mr Jazairy's uncle, who was also his driver, was kidnapped by the militia and his car was stolen. In the car, the militia found documents written by Mr Jazairy to the interior ministry recommending that Najaf's water and electricity supply be cut off. He admitted writing them as a \"suggestion\" to the ministry. </p> <p>There was heavy fighting yesterday as the US 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit made a push into the ancient cemetery known as the Valley of Peace, just north of Najaf, but there was no sign of American troops inside the city. </p> <p>Just a block away from the fighting in the cemetery, half a dozen young militiamen lay resting on fishing nets in a dark, brick basement. </p> <p>They were a platoon from Khalis, a small Shia town just north of Baghdad, and had arrived in Najaf to fight four months ago. Several wore green silk headbands, signifying their commitment to \"martyrdom\". </p> <p>Latif al-Khalisi, their leader, spent his life under Saddam Hussein running from military service. He was sentenced to death four times for suspected membership of the Da'awa party, then the leading Shia opposition group. He welcomed the fall of Saddam. </p> <p>\"We had this happiness at the beginning, then the Americans came and they didn't fulfil anything for us,\" he said. </p> <p>\"All the rich people in the west came and started taking money and contracts in this country. The wealthy people in the west didn't think of the poor people in Iraq.\" </p> <p>Most of Mr Sadr's support comes from the poor, male, urban working class, and the militiamen complained about the lack of work. Many had been soldiers under Saddam. </p> <p>\"There are three kinds of job you can get now: a guard, a janitor or making sandbags for the American camps,\" said Muhammad al-Ajeel. </p> <p>\"And then there's the new Iraqi army. They are fighting with the Americans and tomorrow they might fight Iran or Syria. How can we join our hands with them?\"</p>",
  "Ralph Nader, the consumers' champion who became the scourge of Democrats for his determination to run for US president, faced a concerted challenge yesterday to his candidacy in a battleground state. <p>In two separate lawsuits, Democratic activists in Pennsylvania sought to keep Mr Nader off November's ballot. </p> <p>The move intensifies the war between Republicans and Democrats over Mr Nader's candidacy, a conflict fuelled by the maverick's willingness to accept funds and help from some of George Bush's most ardent supporters. </p> <p>Republicans are eager to see Mr Nader do well - not because of his stand on the environment or Iraq - but in the hope that he will tip the balance towards Mr Bush in the race against John Kerry, the Democratic challenger. But the Democrats have stood their ground, with activists harrying Mr Nader's effort to get on the ballot in several states. </p> <p>In the Pennsylvania lawsuits Democrats accused the Nader campaign of falsifying thousands of names on petitions endorsing his candidacy in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh areas. His campaign was also accused of failing to pay the contractors who organised the petition and who allegedly paid homeless people a dollar for each signature. </p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Nader said only petition gatherers who turned in fraudulent signatures were unpaid. </p> <p>The Democrats took Pennsylvania by a relatively slim margin during the last election and party activists defended the law suits against Mr Nader yesterday. </p> <p>\"The bottom line for us is that we are partisan Democrats, and we are very much interested in getting John Kerry elected,\" said Michael Manzo, aide to a Democratic state legislator. \"We view Mr Nader's candidacy as a threat. Will it be a large threat? We hope not, but we are not willing to take any chances.\" </p> <p>Similar scenarios are unfolding in other states with Democrats fighting a rearguard action to keep Mr Nader out of the presidential race. </p> <p>In the battleground state of Arizona he was knocked off the ballot on a technicality, and the party is raising funds for legal challenges in Florida, Michigan, West Virginia and Nevada. </p> <p>Mr Nader dismissed the challenges as a display of insecurity. \"It shows the lack of confidence Democrats have in their own candidate,\" he told Businessweek magazine. </p> <p>However, among Mr Nader's new supporters this election is the billionaire Richard Egan, who was appointed ambassador to Ireland after raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for President Bush. Campaign monitors say other big Republican donors have contributed as well. In Oregon, also poised for a tight contest, two conservative groups admitted telephoning supporters to help put Mr Nader on the ticket. </p> <p>But even with the new-found patrons, he has made slow progress in his effort to get on state ballots. He missed a chance to get on the ballot in California at the weekend when supporters raised only half the 153,000 signatures required. </p> <p>But Democrats say that was Mr Nader's due when he decided to contest these elections, reopening the feud on the American left begun when Mr Nader drained off crucial support for Al Gore in the 2000 elections, handing Mr Bush his victory. </p> <p>With memories of that defeat still rankling, even some of Mr Nader's closest associates were outraged when he announced his candidacy earlier this year. </p> <p>That anger grew further when Mr Nader rebuffed a request from Mr Kerry to stay out of the race in key states. </p> <p>That is when the Democratic machine stepped in with Howard Dean, a hero to the party's left wing for his anti-war stance, deployed to herd wayward Democrats. </p> <p>One of Mr Dean's aides from his failed campaign for the Democratic leadership founded a website called the Nader Factor which documents Republican support for Mr Nader. </p> <p>Mr Nader is not expected to match the 2.8m votes he won last time. But some like John Zogby, the Democratic pollster, say that hardly matters. </p> <p>He said Mr Nader could hold the balance in several states - should he succeed in getting on the ballot. </p> <p>But his candidacy presents another challenge for the Democrats. </p> <p>\"He is the ghost of the left, he is the one who rallies the anti-war sentiment and Democratic populism, and so his presence in the race is casting a shadow on Kerry,\" Mr Zogby said. </p> <p>\"It's not going to be enough for him just not to be George Bush.\"</p> <p><b>States of flux </b></p> <p>A poll last week had Kerry on 48%, Bush 43%, and Nader 3%. If Nader gets on the ballots, and taking into account polls' margins of error, he can turn several states, including: </p> <p><b>Florida </b><br>Kerry 1% up on Bush <br>Nader 1.5% </p> <p><b>Minnesota </b><br>Kerry 1% up on Bush <br>Nader 2% </p> <p><b>New Hampshire </b><br>Kerry 4% up on Bush <br>Nader 4% </p> <p><b>Pennsylvania </b><br>Kerry 5% up on Bush <br>Nader 5% </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Source: Zogby International, Mason Dixon, the University of New Hampshire</p>",
  "The accusations against Salem Chalabi relate to the murder of an Iraqi finance ministry official, Haitham Fadhil, on May 28. <p>\"It was night, there was a knock at his door and his wife answered,\" Kamil al-Kaylani, who was Iraq's minister of finance at the time, said yesterday. \"Two or three men said they wanted to talk to him, so he came to the door. They shot him dead and then they ran away.\" </p> <p>In a country where so many government officials have met a similar fate, Mr Fadhil's death seemed unremarkable - except that he had been working on a report about reclaiming property owned by the government. </p> <p>Among other things, according to the Los Angeles Times, his report said members of the Chalabi family and their party, the Iraqi National Congress, had illegally seized government property after the US-led invasion last year. </p> <p>The paper quoted a source familiar with the investigation as saying Mr Fadhil had been \"trying to get back those properties that belonged to the people\". </p> <p>The source reportedly continued: \"He told his wife and a friend that he had received a lot of threats from Mr Salem Chalabi directly, who told him, 'You will not stay for long. We will get rid of you.'\" </p> <p>Mr Chalabi - \"Sam\" to his friends - has dismissed the accusations as ridiculous. In an interview with the BBC yesterday, he denied ever meeting Mr Fadhil and said he had been with the Iraqi governing council on the day he was alleged to have visited Mr Fadhil's office and threatened him. </p> <p>The 41-year-old used to have a job with one of London's top firms of solicitors, but the family connections that drew him to Iraq have increasingly become a liability. </p> <p>Before the US-led invasion he was involved with the exiled opposition, helping to draft plans for a new constitution once Saddam Hussein had been overthrown. One of his ideas was to set up a reconciliation commission based on the South African model. </p> <p>When war came, Mr Chalabi took sabbatical leave from his London employers, Clifford Chance, and headed for Iraq, where the Pentagon was keen to make him an adviser to the ministry of justice, as part of Jay Garner's ill-fated project to run the country. When that did not work out, he became a legal adviser to the Iraqi governing council and joined the 10-member committee that drafted the interim constitution. </p> <p>Meanwhile, he teamed up with an Israeli settler to establish his own law business in Baghdad: the Iraqi International Law Group. </p> <p>Operating from temporary premises in the Palestine hotel, the IILG offered to provide a \"last mile connection\" for foreign investors eager to help rebuild Iraq. </p> <p>Its website says: \"You cannot adequately advise about Iraq unless you are here day in and day out, working closely with officials at the CPA [coalition provisional authority], the newly constituted governing council, and the few functioning civilian ministries.\" </p> <p>Mr Chalabi's \"partner for international marketing\" was Marc Zell, an American-born lawyer with extreme Zionist views who had acquired Israeli citizenship. </p> <p>Mr Zell is also a former law partner of Douglas Feith, now a leading Pentagon hawk. </p> <p>Earlier this year Mr Chalabi finally left Clifford Chance, and in April took up a new job as director general of the tribunal that will try Saddam Hussein.</p>",
  "Britain has almost forgotten what killers infectious diseases can be. Smallpox has been eradicated and is now regarded as a potential terrorist weapon rather than a natural threat. <p>HIV/Aids, despite the massive advertising campaigns of the 1980s, is still, wrongly, regarded by many as a danger only to homosexuals or those who have liaisons with people from certain parts of the world: an attitude that may yet create a disastrous health crisis. </p> <p>Sexual diseases generally are regarded by most people as a lifestyle issue. </p> <p>Other exotic diseases may yet be on their way, although West Nile virus and other insect-borne infections are still largely other countries' problems. </p> <p>Most of our worries are now confined to whether the annual flu jab will protect us against feeling awful. </p> <p>But childhood immunisation has become an ever more delicate political problem. Babies do often get grizzly after a jab. Governments add more and more injections to the vaccine schedule and parents increasingly speak of their sense of guilt at putting their children through an unpleasant experience. </p> <p>Public health specialists talk of herd immunity, the need to protect the population at large. They seek to convince even parents with doubts about the efficacy or safety of vaccines of their responsibility to inoculate their children for the greater good. </p> <p>Polio, once a killer here, was still disabling thousands after the second world war. The oral vaccine introduced in 1962 brought a huge fall in cases. It is a remarkable fact that most of very few cases now reported in this country are linked to the vaccine meant to prevent it, but that risk was always outweighed for public health specialists by the evidence of rapidly dwindling disease. </p> <p>Only now, when polio has nearly been eradicated across the world, is an even safer vaccine being introduced. </p> <p>Public health specialists thought they had a good story to tell this week, but a newspaper journalist doing her job revealed the plans for a new combined vaccine earlier than they had intended. </p> <p>By yesterday the government's advisers were in effect blaming the press for ruining it all by concentrating on the safety of mercury preservatives, when the replacement jab will have fewer constituents which may cause red arms and high temperatures. </p> <p>They want no repeat of the MMR controversy, which sent vaccination rates among two-year-olds well below 80% - less than 60% in parts of London. </p> <p>The recent discrediting of the report which caused the fear has given leaders of the vaccination programmes some comfort. But it was not the first time that scares had made inoculation rates tumble. Things were far worse in the late 70s and early 80s when doubt was raised about the efficacy and safety of the whooping cough element in the triple diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis jab. </p> <p>Immunisation rates plummeted far further than in the MMR crisis; indeed that and the salmonella in eggs affair were key factors in officials playing down the looming BSE crisis and its possible health implications in the late 80s and early 90s. </p> <p>The problem is that parents think of their children as individuals they want to protect while governments concentrate on the greater good. But Philip Minor, head of virology at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, says the split exists between doctors and public health officials, too. </p> <p>\"They like to do things that benefit the patient,\" he said. \"If you have a patient on your hands and you give that patient penicillin, for instance, and the patient gets better, it is easy. You think, 'Thank you, thank you, doctor', with tears in your eyes. </p> <p>\"If you have a healthy baby and you give it immunisation and it does not get anything, do you go back to the doctor and say with tears in your eyes and say, 'Thank you. My baby did not get measles because you gave it the vaccines'? No, of course, you don't.\" </p> <p>The government admits that some patients suffer vaccine damage: the Department for Work and Pensions runs a vaccine damage payments scheme. </p> <p>But despite all the preparation for the launch of a new vaccine, at 5pm last night the government could not say how many payments had been made, what they totalled and how many claims were outstanding. </p> <p>The individual still seems to be small beer.</p>",
  "Since 1997, Labour ministers have created more than 600 new criminal offences - and still counting. To judge by the prime minister's July announcements on law and order, it now seems that the well from which all these new laws have been drawn is far from dry. With crime prospectively at the centre of the general election, ministers are busy honing yet more offences, on everything from the preparation of terrorism to putting out your rubbish bags on the street on the wrong day. If they win a third term, there is a chance that by 2009 Labour will created its very own thousand-law Reich. <p>Yet the government is defiantly untroubled by charges of legislative incontinence. It appears, indeed, to welcome them. To the triangulation strategists planning Tony Blair's election campaign, it is axiomatic that the public can never have enough crack-downs. If liberals protest, New Labour's warped worldview tells them, then so much the better. The 2005 election, we can already see, will be an old-fashioned tough-guy bidding war. </p> <p>Labour's promises of new legislation are invariably voiced in the name of the victim. If challenged that their punishments are disproportionate to the crime or may be counter-productive, the reflex ministerial response is populist. Go and ask what the people who live on the estates in my constituency think, they respond. Then you will see. The crude version of this response is that Labour believes it cannot fight what its core voters read in the tabloids. A more highminded and honourable version is to insist that \"our people\" are on the sharp end, and that putting the victim at the centre of the strategy is fundamental to ending the social exclusion that blights lives and communities. </p> <p>There is, though, a problem about this. Though justified to the public in the name of the average decent and deserving person, these policies are increasingly causing unexpected and unintended problems for exactly these same decent and deserving people. And if you seek a spectacular example of this failure of what used to be called joined-up government, you need look no further than a little-noticed select committee report published less than a month ago. </p> <p>Civil legal aid is not one of those social policy issues that makes many hearts beat faster. But access to justice is a pretty fundamental fairness issue. If one side in a dispute can afford legal advice and representation, while the other one cannot, then the scales are tipped in one direction. If neither side in a dispute can get advice and representation when both require it, then the scales may not be so uneven, but the denial of justice is even worse. </p> <p>Such an understanding stands at the core of July's report on the civil legal aid system by the constitutional affairs select committee, chaired by Alan Beith MP. It also stood at the core of the Attlee government's thinking on the subject when the modern legal aid system first took shape more than half a century ago. Financial eligibility for legal aid was originally set at a level where around 80% of all households were eligible for either free advice or for advice for which they paid a means-tested contribution. By 2001, however, the proportion had shrunk to under 47%. </p> <p>The decline in eligibility, though, was only one dimension of the deepening problem. Britain has also become a very different kind of country compared with 1979. A long era of possessive individualism, especially in housing, the replacement of collective by individual rights, not least in employment law, the rapid increase in divorce, and the spread of both a rights culture - notably in discrimination law - and a financial compensation culture have all made substantial contributions to the widening of both the opportunity and need for legal advice and representation. </p> <p>But who can adequately provide such advice and representation today? The legal profession has expanded rapidly; there were 50% more solicitors in England and Wales in 2002 compared with 1992. But this growth only theoretically benefits the poorer client. Lawyers become lawyers to make a living, and the accelerating squeeze on legal aid funding means that fewer and fewer lawyers can afford to do legal aid work. This situation is likely to worsen as new entrants to the legal profession arrive carrying higher levels of personal debt in the form of increased tuition fees. Already there is talk of \"advice deserts\" in some parts of the country. </p> <p>This has happened against a political and economic background in which, as the apostate Blairites Neal Lawson and Paul Thompson put it in these pages yesterday, the country is \"saddled with a historically low level of taxation to spend on public services and to redistribute\". This is also the key problem facing civil legal aid, which, capped since 1999, accounts for an ever-declining share of the public funds now available for all forms of legal aid and assistance. </p> <p> This is where the growing negative impact of the 600 new offences comes in. Overall, the government currently spends around \u00a31.9bn on all forms of legal aid - a sum that accounts for nearly two-thirds of the Department for Constitutional Affairs annual budget. The increasing bulk of this money, however, now goes on criminal not civil legal aid. </p> <p>To hear ministers talk, and to read the headlines that their comments provoke, this expansion is wholly attributable to abuse of the system. The less newsworthy reason is simply this: the government is obsessively changing and expanding the criminal law and the asylum system, with the result that the call on public funds from such cases is gobbling up an ever-larger share of a total that the Treasury has already capped and would clearly like to cut. </p> <p>The upshot, as the select committee says, is that civil legal aid has become the Cinderella not merely of the public funded legal service, but of the government's strategy for addressing poverty and exclusion more generally. This is sharp end stuff for \"our people\", too. It may not generate the headlines that being a victim of crime can, but to be denied access to advice and justice - in a divorce, a housing complaint, or any other category of dispute - is to be just as much a victim, too. </p> <p>It is hard to know which senior minister to blame most: the prime minister, who having long ago pioneered the individual rights approach to employment law now shows no interest in allowing individuals to pursue them; the chancellor, who treats state funding for lawyers as money wasted on a privileged and inefficient service that could be better spent on more popular causes; or the home secretary, whose burdening of the statute book with more poorly conceived and drafted laws makes things worse each year. </p> <p>What is clear, however, is that ever fewer of the people who need it most are now in the position to get the advice and representation they need to make a reality of their nominal rights. They too are victims of a system which supposedly puts victims first. Whatever else this may be, it is not social justice.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>More than a quarter of companies oppose training pregnant members of staff because they think it is a waste of money even though it is against the law, according to the results of a survey published today.</p> <p>The same percentage, 28%, were also unable to cite any statutory entitlements for pregnant staff such as maternity leave to time off allowed to attend antenatal clinics. The survey, carried out by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) as part of its investigation into pregnancy discrimination in the workplace, was based on a poll of 450 employers.</p> <p>The majority of firms had a positive attitude to pregnancy in the workplace and offered support to their female staff, but they said there were issues around maternity cover and whether a woman would return to work after pregnancy.</p> <p>Jenny Watson, deputy chairwoman of the EOC, said: \"Many organisations do handle pregnancy positively and as a result see business benefits, such as better retention rates and increased productivity. Yet the results of our new research suggest that significant numbers of employers have limited knowledge of the law, which may be preventing them from managing pregnancy effectively. </p> <p>\"Practical issues, such as arranging maternity cover, can also present problems for employers who want to treat pregnant employees fairly - but both large and small employers have told us that these practical difficulties can be overcome, or at least minimised, through good planning and dialogue,\" she said. </p> <p>Belinda Phipps, chief executive of the parent support group, the National Childbirth Trust, said: \"These figures sadden me, but I am not surprised. Some companies seem to think that having a baby is the end of a person's working life. But when you look at a woman's life, which may span 80 years, having a baby accounts for maybe six months on maternity leave and two years with a dependent child.\"</p> <p>She said: \"The last thing that pregnant women want who are already facing adjustments in their life is to start worrying about what is happening at work. When you are having a baby you don't want to have to worry about your job as well.\"</p> <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the majority of companies supported pregnant staff and were aware of their statutory obligations.</p> <p>But a spokesman said: \"For the smaller firms which don't have large human resources departments, it is important that the laws which apply to pregnant women are simple and easy to understand. I think there may be an issue of confusion here.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ryanair has attacked trading standards officers as \"anti-consumer\" after being told that its regular promotions for 99p airline tickets are misleading and potentially illegal.</p> <p>In new guidelines for enforcement officers, the Trading Standards Institute said air fares should include all \"non-optional charges\" such as taxes, airport fees and security charges. </p> <p>Picking out the low-cost Irish airline, the institute said a Ryanair offer of \"one million seats from 99p\" which appeared on its website in July was inaccurate. In the case of one ticket, it established that the final price to the customer was \u00a363.85. </p> <p>Ryanair brushed aside the criticism yesterday. Its spokesman Paul Fitzsimmons said: \"The trading standards institute's time would be better spent fighting the anti-consumer rip-off of BA's ever increasing fuel surcharges.\" </p> <p>Ferry companies have long maintained that budget airlines are stealing their cross-channel business by using underhand advertising tactics. </p> <p>Bill Gibbons, director of the Passenger Shipping Association, said: \"The problem we face is that low-cost airlines that flout the law are moving targets.

  "<p>Dr Carol Black's prognosis for the medical profession - that it risked a possibly terminal loss of status because the majority of medical students are now female - began quite promisingly. It would be hard to argue with her that female-dominated professions - with the possible exception of opera divas - suffer from low public esteem and poor pay. Her prescription, though, was a disappointment. The hope for a cure, she said, lay in an equal balance of men and women. More men must urgently be drafted, a rapid reaction force deployed to guard the profession's status from the otherwise inevitable attrition. </p> <p>I am sure Dr Black, only the second woman in 500 years to be president of the Royal College of Physicians, could do better. She complains that women do not reach the higher ranks of the profession or enter the more demanding sectors of it in sufficient numbers. There is, she points out, no female dean of a medical school, head of a department of surgery or of medicine. Yet, while she complains that women don't get to the top, she also laments that if they did, the profession as whole would suffer. </p> <p>It is not surprising that a profession which operated explicit quotas to limit the number of women it recruited should suffer adjustment problems when the effects of lifting those quotas work through. The panic in the British Medical Association about the effects of feminisation is, in part, a measure of progress in what was one of the country's more chauvinistic lines of work. But the anxiety is also a sign of how the attitudes that underlay the quotas have been disguised rather than changed in the past quarter of a century. Dr Black's solution - more male doctors - implies fewer female doctors. What is that, if not a return to quotas? </p> <p>There is nothing wrong with the competence or commitment of the female medical graduates. But they apparently fail to thrive in the profession in a way that doctors seem unable to diagnose, despite the fact that the same phenomenon is present in almost every workplace in the country: they do not make it on to committees, they find the demands of advancement incompatible with family life, they opt in larger numbers for part-time and flexible working. </p> <p>The bottom line of what is being said here is still why can't women be more like men? However, the problem is not that the workplace has been over-feminised but that it has not been feminised enough. If we wish families to continue to exist, to bring up children, to treat their elderly and sick with a modicum of humanity, we have to accept that the burden and costs of work that is now largely the unpaid labour of women have to be shared. We have had half a revolution - the one that lowers the formal barriers to paid employment. The other half - the one that shares the burden, is still a long way off. </p> <p>At present, it is still women who pay. They pay in an impressive variety of ways. Today 67% of women are employed, but they are still underpaid and under promoted. Women in full-time work take home an average of 18% less per hour than men. Women in part-time work (and more women than men are in part-time work) take home an average of 40% less an hour. Women have been entering the law, journalism, business, architecture and the civil service in ever-larger numbers for three decades now, yet the senior ranks of all these professions remain overwhelmingly male. </p> <p>And what about the women who do make it? They pay an even higher price. In the boardroom, for instance, according to a recent survey by NatWest and Director magazine of 470 company directors, only one woman makes it to boardroom for every 10 men - and those who do are far more likely than the men to be single (33% single women against 8% single men). Twelve per cent of the women were likely to be divorced compared with 5% of the men. What the survey suggests is that 30 years on from the legislation that was supposed to fix this problem, women continue to work harder for less and pay a disproportionate emotional and social cost for their efforts. </p> <p>Women have entered the workplace, but the price of advancement continues to be an absolute divide between work and family life, a pattern laid down in the industrial revolution for the convenience of factory owners, and remarkably little changed since. The solution offered by the Vatican and Ukip is to send women back to the home to indulge their better natures and clean behind the fridge. It's a solution that is unlikely to prosper in the 21st century - women would not put up with it and the British economy, like the Italian, could not survive if they did. Italy and the UK have ageing populations and falling birth rates. Of the estimated 2m new jobs that a growing economy is expected to create over the next decade, some 80% are likely to be filled by women. Turning the clock back is not an option. </p> <p>The way forward, though, requires more energy and imagination in the workplace than we have seen so far. If we want family life to survive, then men and women must insist on ways of working that allow them the space and time family life demands. </p> <p>We no longer live in Victorian Britain but we live in something that is, in some ways, worse - in an over-sexualised, atomised and frivolous culture in which the dominant images that surround us derive from the need to keep us consuming. Empowerment, the message is, means having the power to shop; liberation is confined to sexual liberty; self knowledge to the mushy repetition of pseudo-psycho cliches. </p> <p>The workplace insists on the primacy of the shareholders' interest and on its power to define itself as an institution devoid of reciprocal social responsibility. The rights of women have become confused with the right of young women to indulge the most self destructive aspects of male behaviour - to drink to excess or behave as sexual predators. To establish the right of men and women to live in balance between family and work demands a redistribution of the social and economic burden - one reason why it continues to be so heavily resisted. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: isabel.hilton@theguardian.com\">isabel.hilton@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It is a truism that the advertising industry exists on bright ideas, but few can have been as dazzlingly lucrative as Roger Hatchuel's vision. </p> <p>Not that the International Advertising Festival was his brainchild. But when he took it over in 1987, it was a cosy assembly of advertising agencies which gathered in Venice to award each other trophies for creating the most original cinema spots. </p> <p>The trophies remained lion-shaped, the symbol of St Mark, a memorial to Venice, but the hunting ground was to be global. </p> <p>First, Hatchuel expanded the competition to include print and outdoor advertising, then in 1997, when the dotcom boom was still a faint rumble, he created the Cyber Lions to take in the nascent field of online. </p> <p>At this year's festival, Hatchuel announced that 2005 would see sections for radio, public relations and design. </p> <p>Agencies pay up to \u00a3370 a time to enter ads - even a bronze Lion might ensure that an agency in Kuwait, for instance, retains its local contract with a big motor manufacturer while a grand prix could mean the capture of a global contact from another big network. </p> <p>So the cynical would say the expansion is Hatchuel cranking up a money machine. But this is a man whose enthusiasm for advertising has been overwhelming since his days as a law student in London. Procter &amp; Gamble, Mediavision, Pearl &amp; Dean: he has spent one career as a respected hands-on adman and another as adland's impresario. </p> <p>Last year, as recession hit and agencies shed staff, he coined a new festival catchphrase: all work, no beach. </p> <p>Festival delegates duly stepped up the seminar programmes and kept the beach parties low profile. </p> <p>This year, he decreed, was \"the year of the client\". Top executives from big advertisers including P&amp;G, McDonald's, Nokia, Volvo and BMW duly booked their flights to Cannes. </p> <p>Many said they found the experience revelatory.

  "<p>Bernard Levin, who has died aged 75, after many years of Alzheimer's disease, was one of the most famous as well as one of the most controversial British journalists and broadcasters of the second half of the last century. His ever-restless pen provoked emotions that varied from rage, even hatred, to affection and admiration. Employed during the last three decades primarily on the Times and the Sunday Times, his career had also taken him to such publications as the Observer, the Manchester Guardian, the Spectator, the New Statesman, the Daily Mail and the Daily Express. </p> <p>Bernard's mother was the daughter of Ukrainian Jewish emigrants. His father, of Lithuanian extraction, a St Pancras tailor, left her shortly after Bernard's birth in London. Bernard met him only once when he was at university. The family lived in Camden Town and Bernard was brought up, though not strictly, in the Jewish faith. His illiterate grandparents' stories about life in Russia must have instilled in him the passionate belief in the freedom of the individual that lasted his whole life. In return, as he grew older, he used to read to them. Bernard could not read Hebrew, but he could get by in Yiddish. </p> <p>He was a bright child and won a London County Council scholarship to Christ's Hospital, the charity boarding school in Horsham, West Sussex, where he was to experience, for the first time, being mocked in the street and to encounter strong attacks on his opinions. Merely getting to the school was an ordeal, as the sight of a small boy in his uniform with its swirling cloak and tight stockings sometimes provoked jeers. </p> <p>At the school he announced that he was a communist and set up on his desk a small collection of books from what was known as the Little Lenin Library. His fellow pupils, mostly from a very different kind of background, renamed them the Little Levin Library - eventually throwing them out of the window. </p> <p>Another scholarship, in the late 1940s, took Bernard to the London School of Economics where he was much more at home in the pervading leftwing atmosphere. He was soon very active in the student union and politics generally. He also found he could give rein to his penchant for causing mischief and for teasing authority. His impersonation of the LSE's much revered professor of political science, Harold Laski, arguing with himself, knocking down his own propositions one by one, revealing the fallacies in each, was evidently a tour de force. </p> <p>Briefly, after graduation in 1952, he worked as a guide on coach tours, doubtless providing the passengers with more diverse and arcane information than they had any right to expect. Soon, however, he got a job with the BBC North American Service. He had the rather menial task of having to read all the newspapers and weekly journals, cutting out pieces that might be useful to quote on the air. </p> <p>In 1953, he came across an advertisement in Truth, a weekly edited by the liberal journalist George Scott, appealing for editorial staff. At the time, Truth had a very rightwing, even anti-semitic, reputation that Scott was anxious to get rid of. Bernard arrived at their offices and explained that he was applying for a job. When the secretary told Scott the name of the applicant he was delighted by the Jewish name and said: \"Show him in, he's got a job.\" </p> <p>Shortly afterwards, Philip Oakes arrived, also for a job interview, and passed Bernard on the stairs. He mistook him for the office boy. \"He looked about 16, phenomenally clean with scrubbed nails and a coil of dark hair like a bedspring lunging from his forehead ... his suit was dark and well-cut, his handkerchief like an exploded white rose in his breast pocket. His shoes twinkled against the grubby carpet.\" </p> <p>Bernard's first piece for Truth dealt with his disillusionment with the Labour party. Soon he, Oakes and Alan Brien were all sharing an office. It was a tempestuous room. Alan was forever arguing some involved point; Bernard, always capable of doing two things at once, would be contesting the point while correcting proofs. Philip, more likely than not would be laughing at them, while pondering on a poem he was writing. </p> <p>Bernard was beginning to be noticed. During a long newspaper strike, when Truth, as one of the few publications available, enjoyed a surge in circulation, the quality of his contributions stood out. In 1954, the Spectator's then owner, Ian Gilmour, appointed Brian Inglis as the editor of the weekly. Inglis invited Bernard to be his deputy, together gradually building up a distinguished band of contributors, including Karl Miller as literary editor, Brien as theatre critic and arts editor, and Cyril Ray, the wine expert. </p> <p>In 1957, Bernard started to write the column which was to set the seal on his fame. He called it Taper. The subject was the doings of Parliament. He invented comical names for politicians - thus did the then Conservative attorney general Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller became Sir Reginald Bullying Manner. </p> <p>Apart from this column, which earned him the hatred of many MPs, he wrote separate articles commenting on the law - in particular what he saw as the folly of judges - civil servants and other public figures. These articles were frequently rash, giving one to wonder why he was never prosecuted. His ferocious attack on Lord Goddard, the vindictive Lord Chief Justice, a few days after his death in 1958 affronted many people's sense of good taste. </p> <p>Many others confirm Bernard's extraordinary ability to do two or even three things at once; holding forth on Sir Oswald Mosley while typing his column, then switching without pause to an appreciation of the opera he had seen the night before. At the same time, his concentration on himself was on occasion perilous. He told Brien one morning that at dinner in a restaurant the night before, he had been so engrossed in the story he was telling that he did not notice that a man at the opposite table had had a stroke and died until ambulance men came to gather him up. </p> <p>Bernard's capacity for mischief had by no means abated. He and Cyril Ray used to shout abuse at each other across the office, with such insults as \"little Jewish runt\". Brien recalled him going into Karl Miller's office and switching all the jackets of the books to be sent out for review so that Field Marshal Lord Montgomery was puzzled to receive not a book on military strategy, but one on the traditions of the Chinese circus. </p> <p>Considering its impact, it is a surprise to realise that the Taper column ran for only two years. Disappointed by the result of the 1959 election, which saw Harold Macmillan's Conservatives register a third election victory in succession, with a majority of more than 100, Bernard came to dislike Macmillan more and more, believing that he should, and would be thrown out. When this did not happen, he decided to move on, at first going to the Daily Express as theatre critic, and from 1962 to 1965 working at the Daily Mail in the same capacity. He then became a Mail feature writer - and in 1969, What The Papers Say's columnist of the year. Bernard had become well aware of the fickle ways of Fleet Street and had become canny. His contract specified that he should have complete freedom and that no one should ever change anything he wrote, either for its opinion or its style, without his consent. </p> <p>But in 1963 had come a move into television that was to make him a household name. He became an important figure on BBCs late Saturday-night satire show, That Was The Week That Was, and later on its less renowned successor, Not So Much A Programme More A Way Of Life. </p> <p>His role on TW3 each week was to interview someone in the news. He did so in a way that was, then, a trifle shocking. He was one of the first TV interviewers to deploy rudeness as a technique. The result was that the public came to loathe him. In the Daily Express he even featured in a series, The Hate Makers, penned by a then prominent rightwing journalist, Robert Pitman. </p> <p>Going into the theatre, people even spat at him. Some viewers were delighted one evening, when a man strode on to the set and punched Bernard, knocking him off his stool. It was Desmond Leslie, an expert on unidentified flying objects. Bernard had given a bad review to Leslie's wife, Agnes Bernelle. Years later, Leslie came into a Dublin restaurant where Bernard was dining. They chatted for a while. Neither of them referred to the incident. </p> <p>Back at the Daily Mail, in the week of the 1970 general election, Bernard wrote on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday columns of impartial comments on the merits of both sides. For the polling day that Thursday he promised definite advice. On Wednesday evening he wrote his column saying, Vote Labour. The editor called him in and asked him to change it. He refused, reminding him of his contract. </p> <p>Next, he was summoned by Vere Harmsworth, then the proprietor's son. Again he refused to change a word. He was threatened with dismissal, but stuck to his guns. He decided to resign, but was strangely apprehensive, fearing that he would never get another job. In the event, as soon as his resignation was announced he was inundated with offers. Characteristically, he turned down the Guardian on the grounds that he was too much in agreement with their views. He chose the Times, then edited by William Rees-Mogg, where he was to stay until the end of his life. </p> <p>There were many contradictions in Bernard's character. He saw himself as a strong man, physically. When we went to the opera together and there was no possibility of my getting up the stairs, he would insist on carrying me in the way that more brawny friends would do. Once, in the office, he was boasting that he could pick up the journalist Jackie Gillott and whirl her round his head. Instead she threw him to the floor, which did not prevent their being friends. </p> <p>For a man of such erudition who took so passionate an interest in literature and had so consuming a feeling for music, he had surprisingly little visual taste. </p> <p>This lack of taste was most noticeable in his clothes. He loved dressing up in the evening, always wearing to the opera a swirling cloak lined with bright-coloured silk. He imposed this taste on to the women he took with him. When he arrived to pick them up, he brought with him a spray of flowers which they had to pin on their dress, or sometimes, even more embarrassing, a garland for their hair. So fussy was he that he once suggested Katherine Whitehorn go home to change because one of her stockings had a ladder. </p> <p>Equally strange were his insecurities. He never learned to drive, and this could upset him. Being driven by a woman to Glyndebourne, he became convinced that other drivers were sneering at him. He asked her to stop, went into a chemist and bought a sling. He put it on, reasoning that people would now understand why he was not at the wheel. </p> <p>His life in those times was very agreeable. He had an exceptionally wide circle of friends who, for some reason, he kept in separate compartments, a characteristic common perhaps to bachelors. No one was better at keeping his friendship in repair. He never lost or fell out with a friend. His generosity was exceptional, only with great reluctance allowing anyone else to pay for a meal with him. When Cyril Ray's house burnt down, Bernard offered to lend him a large sum to tide him over. </p> <p>Bernard's romantic nature meant that he was usually in love, but wary of commitment. He had a succession of women friends whom he spoilt with lavish presents. In the bedroom he was enthusiastic, but excessively modest, always locking the bathroom door when having a bath, never letting a girl see him naked. In some moods, he never wanted to marry. He and I sat listening to a wife's tearful account of the wrenching break-up of her marriage. When she left us, Bernard said, \"And then people ask me why I don't get married.\" </p> <p>Towards the end of the 1970s, Bernard entered on a strange phase. He fell more in love than ever before with Arianna Stassinopoulos (now Arianna Huffington, and a political commentator in California). Through her he became involved in an organisation called Insight. Part of its ritual was to encourage each other to act out their fantasies. There were stories of Bernard's dressing up in a tutu that boggled the minds of his friends. </p> <p>Thus did he invite some 80 members of his circle to an evening at the Cafe Royale, at which he encouraged us to enrol. It was a strange experience to hear this paragon of logic, sceptical of all humbug trotting out stories that normally he would have scoffed at. At the end of it my neighbour turned to me and said, \"I feel I have lost a friend tonight.\" </p> <p>This embracing of odd ideas led him on to writing articles in praise of the spurious guru Bagwan Rajneesh. It was part of a recurring pattern which led him to support figures he should have detested such as Richard Nixon and his vice-president Spiro Agnew. </p> <p>There are those who believe that the edge of his writing was blunted thereafter. Against that, Alan Wood feels that Insight gave him a measure of confidence, so that he was no longer so vulnerable and no longer shuddered when strangers approached him in the street. A thread of self-doubt ran through the fabric of his life. </p> <p>A quarter of a century ago, Arianna organised a 50th birthday party for him in the south of France. For once, all his disparate friends of all ages were gathered together for this lavish occasion. Wood recalls how many people told him that day that when they had been ill how Bernard had visited them in hospital. \"He was the great visitor.\" </p> <p>Bernard certainly wanted to marry Arianna. She agreed, but made conditions. Somehow, it never materialised. She went to America. </p> <p>In some senses, he had mellowed. He enjoyed the best relations with successive editors of the Times. They liked and admired him for several qualities, loyalty being the most outstanding. His capacity for work was legendary: if he was going away for a few weeks, he would write 12 articles to be used in his absence. Difficulties could arise through his sensitivity about his work and his great reluctance to talk about any problems that he had in his writing, even though he was worried that he was stuck in a series of ruts and was specialising in about five subjects. Gradually, he came to write fewer vituperative articles and more ruminative ones on music (especially Wagner), literature and the arts, though never forsaking his pet hates - lawyers, especially judges, and home secretaries, nor his second love after music - food. </p> <p>Bernard's books included collections of his columns for The Times - the column being his natural form. But there were others too, The Pendulum Years (1971) a history of the 1960s, Conducted Tour (1981), a survey of the music festivals of Europe, and in 1985 he undertook a walk across Spain and France which led to In Hannibal's Footsteps, an informative and entertaining account of his walk and the places he passed through. He followed this with The End Of The Rhine (1987), another excellent account of a walk down the length of the river. A Walk Up Fifth Avenue (1989) was not so successful. His last book, published in 1998, was Enough Said. He became a CBE in 1990. </p> <p>A decade ago, Bernard mentioned to his friends that he was suffering from some unidentifiable illness. Indeed, it was plain to see. Five years passed before he revealed what many had suspected, that he had Alzheimer's disease. The fates could never have devised a more cruel torment for a man who prided himself on his memory, who could without fail dredge up the most apt quotation from his prodigious store of reading. </p> <p>For his friends, it was unbearably painful to watch his struggle to retrieve even the simplest word. He was lovingly supported and encouraged by his devoted friend Elizabeth Anderson. </p> <p>He is survived by his sister who lives with her family in America. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Henry Bernard Levin, journalist, born August 19, 1928; died August 7, 2004 Quentin Crewe died in 1998, and the above obituary has been revised.</p>",
  "<p>\"Let freedom reign\", President Bush scrawled on the bottom of the note that told him Iraq had regained its sovereignty just over a month ago. </p> <p>The stunt looked shallow at the time and appears all the more so in the wake of the Iraqi government's unjustified decision last weekend to close the Baghdad offices of the Arab news channel al-Jazeera. </p> <p>The month-long ban - which blocks the station from operating normally in the country - is wrong on several counts. </p> <p>For a start it does not appear to have been carried out lawfully. According to the station, which broadcast scenes of its own closure live around the world, a squad of Iraqi police officers arrived at its Baghdad offices on Saturday evening, but brought with them an informal letter from the interior ministry rather than an official court order. </p> <p>Even if the closure had been carried out with due regard to the law, however, it would still represent a significant and disturbing blow to Iraq's nascent press freedom. </p> <p>Although the country's prime minister, Iyad Allawi, has insisted that the de cision was taken \"to protect the people of Iraq and the interests of Iraq\", his administration has failed to justify its claim that the suppression of the Arab world's most-watched and freethinking station will do anything to improve security in the country. </p> <p>Instead, it looks like an inept attack on a troublesome critic that refused to be cowed by less drastic action against it earlier this year. </p> <p>Even supporters of al-Jazeera admit that the channel can be provocative; not least broadcasting tapes purporting to show the execution of hostages in Iraq. </p> <p>The station has also given extensive coverage to the operations of insurgent forces. But so have many other news channels. </p> <p>What is different, of course, is that al-Jazeera is widely watched in Iraq and its neighbours and is not - in contrast to most of the Arab media - subject to strict state control. </p> <p>The country's new rulers find the channel dislikeable, but its broadcasts are nonetheless a reflection of reality. The Iraqi people have been promised freedom and they definitely deserve to get it.</p>",
  "<p>Terrence the dodgy heating engineer is round to fix Margaret's boiler. A switch on it needs adjusting, that's all, but Terrence senses easy prey, and tells her the safety valve has blown. He removes the perfectly good valve, replaces it with an inferior valve, then produces a bill for \u00a3256.11. No question about it, Terrence is a cowboy. </p> <p>Unhappily for Terrence, though, this is not any old house. It belongs to <strong> The Cowboy Trap</strong> (Channel 4) and is full of state-of-the-art hidden cameras and microphones. That thing at the bottom of the garden that looks like a shed isn't really a shed at all; it's a high-tech control centre where the Cowboy Trap team are hiding, along with a plumbing and heating expert, to monitor Terrence's work. Once they've established that Terrence is indeed a cowboy, it's time to spring the trap. </p> <p>They have a funny way of getting revenge on dishonest workmen and unscrupulous salesmen. Instead of merely confronting them, or reporting them to the authorities, they get them back with a comic wind-up. </p> <p>So Margaret, who's an actor, says she has to go out but her daughter Daisy will settle up. Daisy, also an actor, says she is busy preparing for an interview for a cabin-crew job with Albanian Airlines the next day. Would Terrence mind running through a few role-plays with her to help with her preparation? Daisy is blonde, busty and low-cut. Of course Terrence wouldn't mind. </p> <p>So Terrence puts on a Hawaiian shirt and a Mexican hat and pretends to be a frightened passenger. \"I don't want to get on that plane,\" he shouts, sitting on a chair in Margaret's kitchen, while Daisy, who's changed into her uniform, tries to calm him down. </p> <p>Next Terrence plays the air-traffic controller who has to talk Daisy down after her pilot and co-pilot have collapsed. \"I'm just about to bump into a volcano,\" she shrieks hysterically, using the salt and pepper as the controls. </p> <p>\"Pull the control stick straight away,\" says Terrence, calmly and reassuringly. He actually turns out to be a very good air-traffic controller. </p> <p>It's quite a nice idea. Terrence has, after all, been taking the mickey with his diagnosis of Margaret's boiler and that bill, so it seems perfectly reasonable to take the mickey out of him. Trouble is, the end result just isn't funny enough for it to work. I'm guessing it was originally destined for an earlier spot, but when Channel 4 saw it they decided to put it out at midnight, which feels about right. Fine for when you stagger in from the pub, but less amusing if viewed while sober. </p> <p>In <strong> Mind, Body and Kick Ass Moves</strong> (BBC3), kung-fu enthusiast Chris Crudelli shows how he can chop through stacks of ceramic tiles using just his bare hands. He does this by gathering up chi, the energy that drives both the body and the universe. Crudelli is a sort of Derren Brown for the world of martial arts. </p> <p>But this show is not just about him. He travels the world meeting martial-arts masters. On a Hong Kong rooftop, grandmaster Leung Ting lies his friend on the floor with a melon on his belly. He then smashes his samurai sword down, splitting the melon in two, but his friend, remarkably, remains in one piece. If Leung Tin ever tries to make friends with you, my advice would be to run. </p> <p>In Taipei, Crudelli meets master Tu Jin Sheng, who stresses the importance of balancing chi - after doing something hard he has to do something soft. So he'll bang a few nails into a block of wood with his bare hands, or hurl chopsticks though a board. Then he'll paint a picture while standing on eggs. Tu Jin's best trick is to tow a truck. With his penis. </p> <p>But my favourite was the Japanese master Sasaki who has developed a shout so loud that he can use it as a weapon. Come at Sasaki wielding a sword, he'll just shout at you, and you'll be so paralysed he'll just take the sword from you. Brilliant. Sasaki's teacher used to be even better - he could shout small birds to death. </p> <p>Perhaps the Cowboy Trap people could borrow Sasaki, and throw Terrence the dodgy heating engineer in for a couple of rounds.</p>"
