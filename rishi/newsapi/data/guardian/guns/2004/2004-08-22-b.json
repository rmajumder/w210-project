  "<p>To seasoned observers of US presidential campaigns, in which negative advertising is a dark and Machiavellian art, it probably comes as no surprise that the biggest jolt thus far to Democrat candidate and Vietnam war soldier Senator John Kerry should come from the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. </p> <p>In a hard-hitting commercial, the shadowy group, which is funded by wealthy Texan Republican Robert Perry, blasts Kerry for \"betraying\" Vietnam veterans with his youthful anti-war protests, concluding that he \"lacks the capacity to lead\". </p> <p>A tough sell you might think, given President George W Bush's lacklustre military record during Vietnam, notably claims that he went AWOL from the Texas National Guard to help his daddy in a political campaign. But with Republican party operatives gambling that you can fool some of the people some of the time - and in a razor-close race you need only fool a few - it might seem a risk worth taking. Perception is all. </p> <p>The US media swarmed all over the Swift Boat ad, temporarily shifting debate from Bush's record as president to Kerry's in Vietnam. Yet such diversionary tactics can boomerang, given Bush's military record. This week MoveOn, the advocacy group that uses the internet to rally members and raise money for ads, often within hours, launched a rebuttal. </p> <p>\"George Bush used his father to get into the National Guard and, when the chips were down, went missing,\" runs the script. \"Now, he's allowing false advertising that attacks John Kerry, a man who asked to go to Vietnam and served with dignity and heroism.\" Twisting the knife, the ad concludes by quoting Senator John McCain, a \"true Republican war hero\", who condemned the Swift Boat ad as \"dishonest and dishonorable.\" </p> <p>The MoveOn counterpunch is part of a new breed of ad funded by \"527s\", named after the IRS tax code that allows political action committees, or Pacs, to raise cash and register voters without actually endorsing a candidate. Thus, MoveOn can stump for Kerry without violating US campaign finance laws. </p> <p>This loophole has led to an avalanche of money being directed to Democrats, much of it from tycoons such as George Soros or Steve Bing, as well as advocacy groups like MoveOn or ACT, which plan to fund ads using receipts from a series of rock concerts, featuring Bruce Springsteen and others, in October. </p> <p>Evan Tracey, who runs TNS Media Intelligence, says 527s account for $60m of the $240m spent so far on a record ad race. \"The 527s have expanded the number of people who are participating in advertising,\" says Tracey, who thinks the code will account for $100m by November. </p> <p>With 527s funding ads that promote Kerry, Republicans have filed lawsuits against this tactic, claiming it violates campaign rules. The issue will probably be decided after the election. Meanwhile, conservatives have launched their own 527-funded \"Boycott the Boss\" ad attacking Springsteen. </p> <p>Tracey predicts the total ad budget - money spent by candidates, party organisations, and Pacs - will run to between $500m-$600m, compared to $200m in 2000. The big question is whether ads work. According to the Political Standard, a newsletter published by the Alliance for Better Campaigns, 60% of voters have yet to watch one. </p> <p>Yet while Pacs like MoveOn sometimes seem to preach to the choir, this is in part because both parties want to rally their base, hoping to reach people who didn't vote in 2000. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Democrats are keen to snatch moderates from Bush. MoveOn's \"Real People\" campaign, chosen from ideas submitted by members, and shot by documentary film-maker Errol Morris, who made Fog of War and The Thin Blue Line, will run this month during the Republican National Convention. </p> <p>The 17 talking-head spots feature disillusioned Republicans who explain why they plan to dump Bush. \"We were given these ideas that there were weapons of mass destruction,\" says US Marine Sergeant Lee Buttrill. \"But where are they?\" Buttrill concludes that WMD were just a lie. \"That wasn't a proper use of American troops. It wasn't a proper use of my life, or my friends' lives, or the marines who I've seen die around me.\" </p> <p>Another spot, from US Marine Colonel Richard Dove, begins, \"I don't think President Bush is a Republican,\" before blasting the president's dismal environmental record. \"I voted for George Bush. I feel very betrayed,\" says Deborah Wood, a Texas housewife whose husband is unemployed. \"I'm still a Baptist, but I'm no longer a Republican,\" says Rhonda Nix, who thinks more needs to be spent on healthcare. And so they continue. </p> <p>But while 527s allowed Democrats to come from behind to match Bush's campaign-spending juggernaut, they also give candidates less control over ads. Thus, Kerry found himself defending Bush from MoveOn's Swift Boat rebuttal, insisting the campaign was about \"issues, not insults\". Ironically, the ad praises John McCain - who wants to plug the 527 loophole.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Claudia Rosencrantz</strong> <br> Job: controller of entertainment, ITV <br>Age: 45 <br> I took three A-levels, zoology, French and German, I got three unconditional places at university, but I chose not to go. To please my father I took a bilingual French secretarial course in London, which means I can type really fast, a very useful skill. I worked for eight years in Fleet Street, starting off by temping for Woman's Realm, picture editing at the Telegraph, then journalism at the News of the World's Sunday magazine, where I wrote a column, What's Hot, What's Not. All the time I wrote hundreds of letters to TV producers, via the Radio Times and TV Times, trying to get a job, I never got one interview. But in 1986 I answered an advert in the Guardian for a job as an LWT entertainment researcher. I wrote a very long letter about why they should employ me - not only did they interview me, they sent me a telegram with the job offer. </p> <p>In the media, determination is everything. You can do anything if you set your mind to it. All you have to do is get a foot in the door, then be keen, bright, enthusiastic and look for ways to be of use. I hate media studies - a waste of time, it's a terrible idea. We can't stand media studies graduates here, the applications go in the bin. Get in as runner, or a temp for any creative media business. You can go far. I'm very old fashioned in that I think to be a successful producer you have to have done every job from the ground floor upwards, to earn your stripes and understand the process. </p> <p><strong> Ian Monk </strong><br> Job: founder of public and media relations specialists Ian Monk Associates<br>Age: 49<br> I have a degree in English, history and politics from Bristol University. I have never believed that academic achievements beyond the basics of the three R's offer any real guarantee of quality and success in the media workplace. Almost inevitably today, most of the 20-somethings in the jobs market do have degrees of varying or often no relevance to their chosen career. Personality, flair, and originality of mind mixed with an appetite for hard work and some fun are the attributes I have always looked for and they are found in both graduates and non-graduates. I am particularly sceptical about the value of media studies degrees since they tend to dwell on the theories of an ideal world rather than the practices of the real one. </p> <p><strong> Mark Lund</strong> <br>Job: group chief executive and shareholder in the advertising agency Delaney Lund Knox Warren <br>Age: 45 <br> I took an English and philosophy degree at Bristol University, and wanted to do something involving writing and thinking. But I actually went to interviews with advertising agencies more because a girl I rather fancied was going along. I joined Lintas as a graduate trainee in account management and have progressed into general management. We look for really bright graduates, the key is to stand out. We want evidence of a good academic career, you have to be able to think and express yourself, and we're looking for ability, people capable of managing others and projects: then we want energy, life, enterprise. We want to see people who have done interesting things in life. I would say get your degree - though we do have people in the company who are not graduates, and they are very good. </p> <p>Media studies? The only bias I have against them is that they have tended to be soft courses in the past, less academically geared than the crunchy classic academic degree studies. </p> <p><strong> Roger Alton </strong><br>Job: editor, the Observer. <br>Age: 56 <br> I produced a mag at school when I was 12 or 13, and found it fun, but first got a taste between school and Oxford university in my teens when I worked at the Observer in the 60s on the Review section because my parents knew someone in the books department. So my view is always that nepotism is a bloody good way of getting in, it really is. And I still do. I thought journalism was a terrific way of earning money (about \u00a310 a week, I think), getting free drink and food at previews, being paid to stay up late, and crucially, not having to get up too early. </p> <p>My qualifications were the usual stuff, A-levels, a university degree, but in any job interview I do with young journalists I don't know if I have ever even registered whether they have A-levels or a degree. It is more what sort of person they are, whether they can write (or preferably, really enjoy sub-editing - the world is full of writers), what their ideas are, whether they are interested in the world around them. I edited the student newspaper at Oxford, and I think that sort of thing is still probably a better qualification than many. </p> <p>I think published output is a good way of getting in now, plus creativity and really being interested. But I do think the better media courses (City University for example), do produce terrific journalists. The teachers know what is required too. </p> <p><strong> Mark Wood</strong> <br>Job: ITN chief executive, former editor-in-chief Reuters <br>Age: 52<br> I joined Reuters from university - Leeds, Warwick and Oxford, where I studied languages, which was the key to applying for a place on the excellent Reuters journalist training scheme. My A-levels were in German, Russian and French and enabled me to go on to study German and Russian to degree level, so they were vitally important. </p> <p>There are now far too many media studies courses in the UK but there are a few excellent ones among them. These courses can be a perfect route into a media job - but studying other subjects can be just as useful. In the end it is aptitude, skill, energy and determination which count. </p> <p><strong> Alan Rusbridger </strong><br>Job: editor, the Guardian <br>Age: 50 <br> I did a BA Hons in English literature at Cambridge, followed by a block release course at Harlow Tech, leading to the National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ) certificate (which I don't think I ever got, having failed shorthand). I think vocational courses are very worthwhile - you can learn how to write tightly and accurately under pressure, and learn all the things - shorthand, law, ethics etc -which the daily grind of the job doesn't allow. The courses have a good record of finding work experience and, sometimes, jobs. It's also useful to know about subjects that might come in handy journalistically - so a degree in subjects such as science, politics, law, a language or economics may give someone an edge over someone else who has done English literature or medieval history. But in the end what counts is whether or not you've got journalistic talent. </p> <p><strong> Nick Pollard </strong><br>Job: head of Sky News <br>Age: 53 <br> I stumbled into journalism the old way, straight from school on to my local paper. My mum wanted me to work in a bank, which she saw as the passport to respectability after teenage wastrel years. I got two rather ropey A-levels, physics and general studies, and started as a 'cub reporter' on the Birkenhead News in 1968. I loved it and enjoyed the part-time courses for the NCTJ certificate (Pitman's shorthand, law, government and newspaper practice) - that's the limit of my qualifications. </p> <p>Some media courses are excellent and prepare students well for the task of battling for media jobs. Some of them fall a long way short of that. We have close ties with Westminster and City universities, sponsor bursary students at both and provide regular placements for their students. The golden rule for any media student should be: 'Get your foot through the door and make yourself conspicuously invaluable'. </p> <p><strong> Jane Root </strong><br>Job: executive vice president/general manager Discovery Channel <br>Age: 47 <br> After doing my A-levels I didn't apply to university, and instead took a one-year course in journalism at the London College of Printing which is one of the best things I ever did. I still use the stuff it taught me today. Later on I did a degree at Sussex in international relations (there were lots of media people there, including Dermot Murnaghan and Helen Boaden, the BBC's new head of news.) I wrote for various magazines and newspapers, including the Guardian, while I was a student. Journalism was my route in to television, one of the many things I wrote about was films - this led naturally to writing about TV, then I managed to get a job as a researcher on a programme for Channel 4 about television. </p> <p>My advice? If you are doing a media course make sure it has a practical as well as theoretical elements, and spend at least some of your free time watching television. You can guarantee your competitors won't. </p> <p><strong> Richard Porter </strong><br>Job: editor, BBC Breakfast <br>Age: 41 <br> I started at my local newspaper, the Newbury Weekly News. I answered an advert for a trainee after passing a maths A-level, and just missing one in economics. That was in 1981 and I spent three years being indentured, and going on block release for my NCTJ proficiency qualification. By 1989 I was working on the Western Daily Press in Bristol. Then I joined the BBC in Bristol, working on its evening regional Points West programme as a producer. I then worked my way around the BBC in Newcastle, Leeds and Manchester, before joining News 24 when it launched in 1997. In 2001 I became editor of Breakfast News - horrible hours but I've barely ever worked nine to five, </p> <p>My advice now would be to go to university, people now have so many qualifications, but whatever you do you have to stand out. I also absolutely believe we should not only recruit graduates. Not having a degree didn't stop me, at the end of the day. You need other qualities - persistence, you have to be prepared to learn, work hard, move around. If people come to me with good A-levels, a good gap year experience, and have worked in student newspapers, I think that shows commitment. I also don't think, per se, media studies are a bad thing, at A-level it shows kids have worked hard and are committed. </p> <p>I have been impressed with journalism students from City University, who do work experience on Breakfast, and when I was running regional programmes at BBC Manchester we had some good students from the University of Central Lancashire. </p> <p><strong> Simon Kelner </strong> <br>Job: editor, Independent <br> Age: 47 <br> I completed the NCTJ one-year pre-entry course in journalism at Preston Polytechnic (now the University of Central Lancashire). From there, I got a job as an indentured trainee journalist on the Neath Guardian in South Wales. I have no academic qualifications other than A-Levels, and a diploma from Preston. I have since been made an honorary fellow of the University of Central Lancashire. </p> <p>Media courses have changed a lot since my day. Ours was a pretty rudimentary course. But I think it still holds true that the best training is to be had on a local paper. </p> <p><strong> Frances Sheen </strong><br>Job: editor, B magazine <br>Age: 31 <br> I took four A-levels - English, history, French and psychology then a degree in contemporary history at Sussex University, followed by an NCTJ course at Harlow College. </p> <p>Media Studies wouldn't sway me into thinking a writer had better qualifications than any other graduate. The only way I think it may help is that it can get you an 'in' for work experience. </p> <p><strong> Max Clifford </strong><br>Job: founder of PR firm, Max Clifford Associates <br>Age: 61 <br> I left Pelham Secondary Modern in Wimbleon in 1958 with no qualifications. I was 15. My first job was in a local department store. I got the sack after a year for upsetting customers. I played water polo and through that got to know the sports editor of the local paper who got me a job as a trainee reporter for the Merton and Morden News. I started a record column and in 1962 I was headhunted by EMI records where I was given an unknown band called The Beatles to launch.</p> <p>Academic qualifications have very little appeal to me - the most important thing it shows is that the people had the discipline to work hard in this area. It takes me up to three years to train people into the real world of PR as opposed to the theory. A degree in PR is an indication of their dedication but not of their ability. </p> <p><strong> Andrew Walmsley </strong><br>Job: founder and chief operating officer of i-level, a specialist digital/internet media buying and planning agency <br>Age: 40 <br> I got terrible A-levels, Ds in politics, economics and English, so I didn't go to university. I did an HND business studies course at a college in Ealing, then went on to sell helicopter engines for Rolls Royce which was a firm grounding for a job in the media - it involved prodigious quantities of alcohol! I wanted to get into the media, and got my first job at BMP as a media buyer. </p> <p>I founded i-level in 1999 after doing an MBA at Kingston University on specialist digital media marketing. We employ 60 people, and we are we are taking on six graduates this year. The people we look for will have good degrees. They have to have an interest in the sector - I can't imagine employing someone who isn't on the internet. I believe that the qualities needed for success include being numerate, articulate, personable, and, essentially, having drive. </p> <p><strong> Tess Alps </strong><br>Job: chairs PHD Group UK, a media planning and buying company <br>Age: 50 <br> I read English at Durham, followed by a postgraduate drama diploma from Mountview Theatre School. I ended up in the media business through a completely serendipitous route and I still have every intention of getting a proper job one day! </p> <p>For our business there are only two essential requirements; people have to be able to communicate, on paper and verbally, and add up. Most recruits are graduates, but it's not an absolute rule. We don't look for any specific qualifications, with the possible exception of hardcore data analysts, where a double first in pure maths comes in very handy. We're looking more for general intelligence, a lateral, problem-solving brain, a lively interest in media, brands and society, and an appetite for challenge and fun. We give recruits all the knowledge and skills they need when they arrive. </p> <p><strong> Lorraine Candy </strong><br>Job: editor-in-chief, Elle <br>Age: 36 <br> I left Liskeard comprehensive school in Cornwall at 16 with 10 O-levels and worked on the Cornish Times as an editorial assistant before joining the Wimbledon News as a junior reporter aged 17. In all the job interviews I have conducted during my career, I have never asked an applicant about their academic qualifications. </p> <p>Enthusiasm, great ideas and a brilliant understanding of the publication they want to work on is what sells an applicant to me. You'd be amazed at the number of people with first class media qualifications who sit in interviews and betray a blatant lack of understanding about the publication - many sit before me without actually having read the latest edition. Academic qualifications are meaningless if you don't have a passion for the job.</p>",
  "<p>There was no public interest reason for some of the press intruding into the privacy of the home secretary last week by revealing his friendship - or, more truthfully, alleged friendship - with a woman. If the terms of the editors' ethical code were to be strictly applied publication was indefensible. </p> <p>But the code has never been obeyed, either by letter or in spirit, partly because tabloid editors remain hostile to its existence and constantly seek to circumvent it, partly due to the code's police authority - the press complaints commission - failing to take action whenever confronted by collective breaches, but mainly because the code itself has to be flexible in order not to inhibit press freedom. </p> <p>Self-regulation was designed to allow editors a right granted to no other institution: a right to be wrong. That may seem to outsiders, especially lawyers, to be an outrageous licence, but how can it be otherwise? </p> <p>However much I might rail against bad behaviour by the modern press, I appreciate that editors must be allowed to exercise freedom. That's why the code cannot be too rigid. Despite the rules and the use of case-law precedence, individual cases have to be treated on their merits. It means that there always will be grey areas for editors to exploit to their own advantage. </p> <p>In breaking the David Blunkett story, Andy Coulson, the editor of the News of the World, clearly recognised he could not advance a public interest defence, though there was a vague hint of one in the sanctimonious assertion that a \"love affair with a married woman cannot be condoned\". (Since neither of the parties has said anything on the record, I must stress \"alleged\" love affair). </p> <p>Coulson's paper did not name the woman and last week he refused to be drawn on why he took such a decision. Was it because he didn't know the identity? Surely not. Was it because Blunkett was a public figure, and therefore \"fair game\", while the woman was not? Possible and, if so, a perfectly reasonable compromise in the circumstances. Was it the result of a surreptitious deal? A senior News of the World executive said firmly: \"There was no deal\". </p> <p>Maybe we will know in future. What was indisputable is that the Mail on Sunday virtually copied the NoW story in its later editions and, next day, the Sun and the Daily Mail showed no compunction in naming the woman. Nor did either paper shy away from claiming that the woman - whose lawyers had written to papers warning them off from further intrusion and harassment - was pregnant. </p> <p>None of these revelations were reported in the Guardian, the Independent or the Financial Times. BBC TV and radio news programmes also ignored them. As a spokesman explained: \"We saw it as a purely private matter which merited no coverage\". </p> <p>The Daily Telegraph and the Times initially chose to hold their noses but the former cracked first, carrying a short piece which named the woman, providing it with a lame excuse later to berate the Guardian for refusing to follow the pack by publishing. Then the Times, apparently roused by a Guardian leader which questioned rival papers' tacit support for the culture of voyeurism, responded with a polemic arguing that though the home secretary had a right to his privacy, the public had a right to information about politicians' personal lives because it \"may affect their judgment\" of them. </p> <p>The logical conclusion from this editorial must be that, in future, the Times will report on who is sleeping with whom. The public interest demands no less. Of course that won't happen. The editor, Robert Thomson, is too squeamish to do so himself, but not too squeamish to follow up stories in a sister paper. The Times's story on Friday, which alleged that Blunkett had helped his woman friend obtain an American passport for her son, showed further evidence of confusion. Even if true in every detail, it was perfectly obvious that he had done nothing in the least improper, but its placement across the top of the front page, allied to the nudge-nudge headline and suggestive first paragraph, implied otherwise. If this story was subjected to a public interest test, as defined in the editors' code, it would surely fail. </p> <p>If we stand back and view this sordid episode impartially, it would appear that the tabloids have acted against the code and have not sought to claim otherwise. It was one of those occasions when they couldn't help themselves: they knew the story, though of no public benefit, would interest their readers. By acting together the cabal of editors - News of the World, Sun, Mail on Sunday, Daily Mail - were also certain that the PCC would turn its face to the wall. The tabloids' overt flouting of the code has one virtue: its candour. </p> <p>Not so the high-minded Times and Telegraph which have been guilty of hypocrisy. Worse than that is the precedent they have set. Their sacrifice of principle over practice reinforces the tabloids' defiance of the ethical code. They have forfeited the right, which they exercised so successfully in 1990 in drawing up the code and setting up the PCC, to hold the tabloids to account for their misdemeanours. </p> <p><strong>Shooting off their mouths</strong></p> <p>Has the Countryside Alliance taken leave of its senses? It has made a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission about the Bristol-based Western Daily Press which, on the evidence I have seen, appears wholly unjustified. </p> <p>There has been a running battle between the alliance and the paper since April, which culminated last week in a trenchant front page leading article calling for the resignations of the alliance's head of media, Tim Bonner, and its chief executive, Simon Hart. At its heart, the row is over that most divisive of issues: hunting. </p> <p>The pro-hunt alliance clearly feels it is not getting a fair crack of the whip from the Daily Press. But it has chosen to stage its battle on strange ground: on the contents of various readers' letters to the paper. Bonner, in claiming that some letters have been \"offensive and inaccurate\", has variously demanded rights of reply, apologies and corrections. </p> <p>He has also complained to the editor, Terry Manners, about what he perceives to be anti-hunt leading articles. The alliance pair obviously believe they have a good case, having sent me their correspondence, but I just can't fathom what they are complaining about. Comment is comment, after all. As for the supposed inaccuracies, they hardly appear so bad as to require a full-frontal assault on the editor. </p> <p>A sense of proportion, not to mention a sense of humour, would pay greater dividends, and a public relations chief, such as Bonner, should know better than to back Manners into a corner. An editor at bay is as fierce as any stag. </p> <p>As a supporter of hunting myself, which I mention only to ensure that they do not accuse me of bias, I think they are doing their own cause a disservice with this trivial action.</p> <p><strong>Jaspan goes out with a bang</strong></p> <p>An extraordinary article in Friday's issue of the Scotsman, headlined \"The lies of Andrew Jaspan\", devoted a whole page to disputing comments made by the editor of the Glasgow-based Sunday Herald. </p> <p>Even in the dog-eat-dog world of Scottish journalism it appeared like overkill. But there was a much more interesting behind-the-scenes story which began with Jaspan's appearance two days before on Newsnight Scotland. </p> <p>In a discussion with John McGurk, editorial director of the Scotsman, it was generally felt that Jaspan got the better of McGurk by claiming that the transformation of the Scotsman into a compact amounted to \"the last throw of the dice\" for the paper. </p> <p>He cited various statistics to claim that the Scotsman's circulation was in a perilous state and followed up by laying into the content, arguing that it is \"not a serious paper\" and \"out of tune with Scotland\". </p> <p>McGurk hit back, saying that when Jaspan edited the Scotsman a decade ago its sale fell faster than of late. In other words, it was the usual knockabout journalistic stuff. </p> <p>But it did not end in the studio. After the programme, as Jaspan was talking to the show's producer and presenter, he was surprised by the unexpected arrival of the Scotsman's burly managing director, Stephen Walker, who began to harangue him so forcefully that he was eventually asked to leave the building. Perhaps Jaspan, who is soon to take up the editorship of the Age in Melbourne, will find things a little less heated in Australia. </p> <p><strong>It's one big game ...</strong></p> <p>Every journalist would like to \"own the train set\", and have their own newspaper, TV channel, radio station or movie studio. Now, without the billions usually required, comes a chance to assume Citizen Kane status. </p> <p>An enterprising former TV scheduler and law student, Susannah Lees, has invented a board game entitled Media Mogul.

  "<p>Genesis P-Orridge is talking about the day he was asked to rescue a series of radical movies made by William Burroughs, artist Brion Gysin and film-maker Anthony Balch from a skip. It was 1980 and P-Orridge was living on the dole in Hackney, east London, fronting art-punk band Throbbing Gristle. \"Brion called me from Paris,\" recalls P-Orridge. \"Anthony had died, and all the films they had made in the 1950s and 1960s were about to be destroyed. 'Here's the address,' he said. 'Do what you can to save them. Go and get them, and they're yours. You'll know what to do with them.' \" </p> <p>The address led to the small, cramped office of a film distribution company in Soho. The rent hadn't been paid and the offices were being torn down. It was already late in the afternoon, and P-Orridge's only means of raising money was cashing a housing benefit cheque. \"So I got my rent money, a black cab and a slip of paper, and went down to Soho. Sure enough there was an old building and these burly workmen were picking up the cans of 35mm film to throw them into the dumpster. Minutes later they would have been destroyed. I gave them \u00a35 to put them in the cab, and went back to Hackney.\" </p> <p>The films on which Burroughs, Gysin and Blach collaborated - among them The Cut Ups and Towers Open Fire - have been cult objects for years. The Cut Ups was first shown in the mid-1960s at the Cinephone on Oxford Street, where the manager begged for a change of programme on account of the keys, coats, bags, underwear, and other strange items left behind by the disorientated audience. For years they lay in a stack of dusty film cans in Soho, until P-Orridge salvaged them. Once they had been catalogued and processed, he gave the films their first showing for years, in London and Manchester. Since then, snatched scenes from the movies have cropped up in various documentaries, including Klaus Maeck's Commissioner of Sewers, which combines footage from The Cut Ups with interview material and inimitable readings from 1986. For the most part, though, they have been excluded from the cultural record. </p> <p>\"Life is a cut-up,\" insists Burroughs in Maeck's film. \"As soon as you walk down a street your consciousness is being cut by random factors. The cut-up is closer to the facts of human perception than linear narrative.\" The techniques began when Gysin sliced through several layers of newspaper while cutting a mount in his room at the Beat Hotel in Paris. \"I laughed so hard,\" he recalled later of the chance juxtapositions thrown up by the scalpel, \"my neighbours thought I'd flipped.\" His neighbours included Burroughs. \"You've got something big here,\" he told Gysin excitedly. Indeed, cutting through the word - disrupting the reality tapes, as Burroughs called it - was the most extreme face-lift writing ever got. </p> <p>Experiments with the new technology of home recording followed, with Gysin, Burroughs and electronics genius Ian Sommerville pioneering the world's earliest examples of sampling and tape manipulation. And with the arrival of film-maker Anthony Balch, who had cut his teeth making TV commercials, film became the logical conclusion for their experiments. When Burroughs produced his script for Towers Open Fire, Balch started filming in Paris and London. The film opens with Burroughs as the voice of control (\"white, white, white as far as the eye can see ...\") and ends with pages of Egyptian hieroglyphs blown by the wind down a country track. Though not strictly a cut-up movie, the film is full of the chance juxtapositions of the method, and filming for The Cut Ups soon followed, continuing over a period of years in Paris, Tangier, New York and London. Once it was finished, Balch assembled the footage on to four reels and gave them to his editor, instructing her to cut a foot from each reel - just enough time to see an image without absorbing its narrative details - and splice them together sequentially, sight unseen. </p> <p>\"They edited everything mathematically,\" says P-Orridge of The Cut-Ups. \"Regardless of any narrative or linear sense, in order to erase the concept of the author, and so that what they called The Third Mind would kick in and become the driving force of whatever happened. Which to this day is an incredible idea.\" </p> <p>The soundtrack comprised Burroughs and Gysin permutating phrases from a Scientology auditing test. The result is by turns hypnotic and disturbing; a kind of undiluted cerebral caustic. The Cut Ups runs counter to our essential conditioning, and provokes strong reactions because of it. \"It's unusual to find someone working outside the satisfaction of people's vicarious needs,\" says P-Orridge. \"It's always more of the same, the instant gratuitous pleasure, rather than erasing the ownership of the narrative. That's the big difference. The audience always wants to feel that they have power over the unfolding of the story. As soon as that's blocked, it's like any other craving. You get an aggressive response.\" </p> <p>The Cut Ups remains as refreshing and startling as ever - a radical re-visioning that shows us how we view and approach reality is more than a passive, reactive sport, but a continually creative enterprise. P-Orridge has just returned from showing the films to an art-world audience in Basle. \"Though we feel we're very sophisticated now, culturally and aesthetically, the impact on this audience was still immense,\" he says. \"They were entranced and completely silent.\" </p> <p>\"There's a certain mythology that has grown up around the films, and around William and his work,\" he adds. \"People have a great trust in the method and the process, which has become so all-pervading in popular culture and the mass media that it's vital future generations understand and are aware of the source material, and the original thinking behind what may now be mundane.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Thee Films, a collection of Burroughs' movies, and Commissioner of Sewers are available from <a href=\"http://www.Screenedge.com\">Screenedge.com</a>.</p>",
  "When events in the Middle East turn especially bloody, as they have during the last couple of weeks in Najaf, I am often struck by a whimsical - some might say ridiculous - thought. <p>I imagine that the man at the centre of the trouble is not Moqtada al-Sadr (or whoever happens to be the villain of the moment) but Gandhi, the leader of India's struggle for independence. I wonder what he would have done about it.</p> <p>Gandhi's methods of non-violent resistance have never attracted much interest in the Middle East - which is rather odd, because he played a crucial role in ending British rule in India, which in turn led to the unravelling of an empire.</p> <p>It doesn't seem to occur to people that there could be lessons there for ending the American presence in Iraq, say, or the Israeli occupation of Palestine.</p> <p>Gandhi was a Hindu but readily incorporated other ideas into his philosophy. Like many Muslims today, he would undoubtedly have appreciated jihad, self-sacrifice and martyrdom as concepts, though not the methods that often accompany them.</p> <p>He didn't believe in killing people - or animals, for that matter - but he did understand the principles of asymmetric warfare, now used by bin Laden and others to fight a more powerful enemy with ingenuity and minimal resources.</p> <p>It might be argued that Gandhi took asymmetric warfare to its logical conclusion: dispensing with weapons altogether, he relied instead on mass public support and moral superiority.</p> <p>\"Nothing but organised non-violence,\" he wrote, \"can check the organised violence of the British government.\" One of Gandhi's most celebrated exploits came in 1930, after the British authorities made it illegal to possess salt unless bought from the government's salt monopoly.</p> <p>The price was such that a year's supply of salt cost the average Indian three days' wages. Gandhi decided to defy the law by getting some natural salt from the sea - 24 days' walk away. This also allowed him to proselytise along the route, urging village chiefs to resign their government positions (about 300 did so).</p> <p>Before long, this became a nationwide campaign of defiance, with illegal salt everywhere and British rule in disarray. Some 60,000 people were arrested - more than the jails could cope with.</p> <p>Today, Gandhi is viewed as a rather saintly, unworldly figure but at the time many regarded him as a menace.</p> <p>Winston Churchill could scarcely contain his apoplexy at \"the nauseating and humiliating spectacle\" of this \"seditious fakir, striding half-naked up the steps of the Viceroy's palace, there to negotiate a parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.\" </p> <p>Gandhi might be described as the father of modern protest movements. His techniques of non-violent direct action have been influential in the west, where they have been adopted and adapted for all sorts of campaigning purposes - against the Vietnam war and nuclear weapons, for example - and by organisations such as Greenpeace.</p> <p>In the Middle East, though, his ideas have less appeal. Maybe it's because a wispy vegetarian in granny glasses and loincloth doesn't fit with Arab views of a manly hero. The fact that Gandhi had a moustache of almost Iraqi proportions does little to redeem him: John Wayne and Sylvester Stallone are far more attractive role models for the Mahdi militia.</p> <p>Some, of course, would offer a different explanation: that Islam is an inherently bloodthirsty religion. This is a view that Bin Laden and his kind have done much to encourage.</p> <p>There are certainly some violent passages in the Koran - though before basing a case on that it's worth also considering the vast amount of supposedly righteous smiting and slaying that takes place in the Old Testament.</p> <p>A number of Muslim writers have made a plausible case for Islamic non-violence. One is the elderly Syrian scholar, Jawdat Said, who watched the activities of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt during the 1950s and predicted that the use of violence by Islamic movements would eventually prove self-destructive. </p> <p>He has been promoting his non-violent ideas ever since, apart from several periods in jail. Meanwhile, his sons got into trouble with the Syrian authorities for refusing to serve in the army, and were not allowed to graduate from Damascus university as a result.</p> <p>There's also a Shia cleric, Imam Mohammad al-Shirazi, who calls for Islamic non-violence, as well as Khalis Jalabi (a Saudi doctor) and Khalid Khishtainy (an Islamic scholar and writer).</p> <p>One problem with \"non-violence\" is that the word sounds rather negative when translated into Arabic, implying passivity and surrender. Khishtainy therefore uses an alternative term - \"civil jihad\" - which sounds more positive and in some ways better reflects Gandhi's methods.</p> <p>Whatever people call it, though, it's still liable to freak out the authorities. In the Syrian town of Darya, a small group of citizens got together, influenced by Jawdat Said's ideas of Islamic non-violence. They set up a free library and showed a number of videos (all of them licensed by the authorities) - including one on the life of Gandhi. They also discouraged bribery and smoking, and did some voluntary work to clean up the town.</p> <p>In Syria, as in much of the Arab world, it is easy to see how a bit of unpaid street-cleaning might be interpreted as a subversive message to the government, and quite possibly that is what the people who did it intended.</p> <p>It's reminiscent of a tale from Morocco about a university graduate who, unable to find a real job, set himself up as a street shoe-shiner. He was duly arrested for political agitation because he kept his degree certificate on show, along with his polish and brushes.</p> <p>In Darya, the final straw came in May last year when the non-violent activists held a silent march protesting against the invasion of Iraq. A few days later, 22 men were ordered to report to Military Security. Eleven were kept in detention until January this year, and seven more until April.</p> <p>The remaining four were tried in secret by a Field Military Court and convicted for the bizarre offence of \"attempting to establish a religious organisation, involvement in unlicensed social activities and attending unlicensed religious and intellectual classes\".</p> <p>Muhammed Shehada, 26, who has a degree in English and was doing military service, and Mu'atez Murad, 28, a mechanical engineer, were sent to jail for three years. Haythem al-Hamwi, 28, a medical doctor, and Yahya Sharabajee, 26, an accountant, were jailed for four.</p> <p>The procedures for Field Military Courts, Amnesty International says, fall far short of international standards for fair trials: there is no legal representation and little opportunity for the accused to defend themselves. Decisions are binding, with no right of appeal.</p> <p>In any case, the military courts are not really supposed to try civilians. They were set up under \"emergency\" regulations (now a more-or-less permanent fixture) to look into offences committed during wartime or military operations.</p> <p>Gandhi once cheerfully remarked that prison enabled him to catch up on lost sleep, but the experience of the four Syrians has been very different. The men are now being held in Sednaya prison, about 15 miles north of Damascus, in what Amnesty International describes as \"extremely unhealthy, dehumanising and degrading\" conditions.</p> <p>\"They have spent prolonged periods incommunicado,\" says an Amnesty spokesperson. \"Three of the men have been allowed only one visit during 15 months' detention, while one has received no visits at all.</p> <p>The men are reported to be infested with lice and are allowed to take a cold shower only once or twice a month.</p> <p>\"They have been subjected to various forms of torture and ill-treatment, including threats and insults; having their fingers crushed; beatings to their face and legs; having cold water thrown over them or their blankets; being forced to stand for long periods during the night; hearing loud screams and beatings of other detainees; sleep deprivation; being stripped naked in front of others; and being prevented from praying, and from growing a beard.</p> <p>\"They have been held in harsh conditions, including being crammed with about 30 others into communal cells of 5m by 5m, or spending prolonged periods in solitary confinement.\" </p> <p>Haythem al-Hamwi is said to have been held incommunicado, in solitary confinement, for over six months - allegedly because when the military judge asked him if he would ask for mercy, he replied: \"No, I ask for justice.\" Civil jihad may still be a better option than Moqtada al-Sadr's, but it is definitely not for the faint-hearted.</p>",

  "<p>The words 'August bank holiday' and 'misery' have somehow become synonymous. The question is: which kind of misery will you opt for next weekend? The 'stay-at-home, sitting on the roof of your caravan waiting for a helicopter to rescue you from rising floodwater' kind, or the 'go abroad and spend half the time camping in an airport terminal' kind? </p> <p>The last long weekend of the summer wouldn't be the same without dire predictions of travel chaos or freak weather. Yet thousands of us persist in squeezing the most from our precious three days by heading off on a short break. </p> <p>The rise of the mini-break has been one of the biggest travel phenomena of recent years, with the traditional two-week holiday ditched in favour of lots of bite-sized chunks of travel. You will certainly get to see more places this way. But like most bite-sized snacks, they leave you hungry for more. In an age of congested motorways, ailing rail networks and disgruntled check-in staff, we are just increasing the time we spend travelling and reducing the time we spend in our chosen destination. </p> <p>I speak as one who spent most of a recent Saturday stuck in gridlock on the M25 en route to a spa hotel. The purpose of the trip? Relaxation. Try telling that to the masseuse who nearly snapped her fingers on my shoulders, taut as steel girders from four hours of gripping a steering wheel. It took a good hour of kneading and 'sounds of the rainforest' mood music to restore me to the state of moderate tension and fatigue that I was in before I set off. </p> <p>Twenty-four hours later as I sat in my gently overheating car on the same stretch of motorway, only pointing in the opposite direction, I made myself a solemn promise: from now on I'll save my precious days off for a proper holiday: the kind that enables you to make life-changing decisions, catch up on months of lost sleep and read six blockbusters back to back. </p> <p>Which brings me to the third kind of bank holiday misery and the sweetest of all. Do nothing. Go nowhere. Phone friends who aren't home and feel sorry for yourself because everyone else is off having fun. Then switch on the travel bulletin and allow yourself a smug smile of satisfaction.</p>",
  "<p>Tax dodging, cows, collaborators ... our turboprop from Gatwick had just flattened out at its cruising altitude, and this was all I'd been able to tell my daughters about the Channel Islands. My wife Birna had supplemented these insights with little potatoes and Derren Brown shooting blanks into a sandbag when, perhaps 20 seconds later, we settled into our descent. 'It can't be a proper island,' muttered six-year-old Valdis, peering down at the gold-bordered bull's hide that is Jersey from above. 'It's too ... near.' </p> <p>Happily, my 10-year-old son Kristjan had speed-read his seat pocket's bounteous promotional content, and during the three-minute drive from airport to hotel fired out a bullet-point account of the island's heritage, fauna and topography. Ten miles by five, no political parties, a lot of Portuguese workers, Britain's only green lizards. 'And when the Queen comes to visit,' he concluded, 'the Seigneur of Trinity gives her two chained mallards on a plate.' </p> <p>Listening to this, and watching a chauffeur-driven Humber of the colonial era sweep past us up the hotel's carriage drive, I began to wonder what had brought us here. We didn't have a suitcase of sovereigns to launder nor, as far as I was aware, a round of Russian roulette to televise. Was Jersey appropriate for a family weekend? </p> <p>Our presence on the plane had lowered the average passenger age dramatically, and the discreetly plush Hotel L'Horizon's ambience suggested we'd incite much tutting behind Daily Mails. Ravel's Bolero droned ominously from the restaurant, whose wine list eagerly referenced Tory politicians ('relaxed yet reliable - like Ken Clarke in shades'), and whose menu bore a prominent warning that anyone making or receiving mobile phone calls at the table would be expected to compensate fellow diners by settling their drinks bills. </p> <p>Hushed and indoor, the pool seemed no place for three children whose aquatic careers have focused on doing every 'don't' depicted in that illustrated guide to bathing etiquette which decorated the changing-room walls of my youth. They bomb, they run, they push, they duck. Please, I thought, meeting the steady gaze of a swimming-capped breast-stroker, please do not let them pet. </p> <p>We lugged these misgivings up to our adjoining rooms, but throwing open the balcony doors they all flew gaily out. Before us sprawled the majestic apotheosis of Basil Fawlty's encapsulation of a marine prospect: over there, between the land and the sky. St Brelade's Bay is a gaping crescent of underpeopled sand, a mile-wide, come-hither sweep of soft gold that makes you want to get out there and do what dads do, and what I generally don't. In a moment there I was, getting down and dirty with the buckets and spades, becoming slightly too hearty during the French cricket. Above us were what my son would soon reveal as Britain's most dependably cloudless skies; lapping towards us, its warmest waters. Not hard to picture those first storm troopers paddling through the gentle surf, battle-ready grimaces melting into lazy smiles, Mausers hanging limply at their sides. </p> <p>If we'd done nothing else for two days no one would have complained, particularly when it became apparent at dinner that our table was by no means the youngest, and only debatably the loudest. A bustling and convivial breakfast buffet 12 hours later confirmed that our child-shushing paranoia had been misplaced. </p> <p>'We're trying to attract a broader variety of visitor,' confirmed tourist guide Arthur Lamy when we met him the following morning at a bike-hire shop in the capital St Helier. For broader read younger: the archetypal Jersey tourist is a dying breed. The Western world's most reliable electricity supply, north-western Europe's cleanest sewage - most of the facts that continued to leak fitfully from Kristjan's mouth seemed stubbornly targeted at elderly mainlanders with a twitching mistrust of two-pin plugs and bidets. </p> <p>Jersey's modest proportions and benign climate make it well adapted to the bicycle, but its inhabitants' average wealth and age do not: there are more cars than people on the island, and ushering an unsteady six-year-old through St Helier I was made uncomfortably aware of it. Pedalling in a disjointed crocodile behind Arthur, we set off along the three-mile promenade, then turned inland and uphill, away from the traffic, past potato fields and neo-Georgian expat mansions. It was another day of brazen sun, and we had the dappled lanes to ourselves; Arthur's breezy, over-the-shoulder commentaries were the perfect accompaniment. 'See that?' shouted back Arthur, jabbing out a thumb at a Mazda dealership. 'That's the old Nazi power station.' </p> <p>Tickled to have bagged themselves a British Isle, the occupying army built things all over Jersey. Being German, they're still there: every beach is bookended by hefty, squat and effectively indestructible gun emplacements, every hill topped by a radio tower. Hitler's Atlantic Wall was a 1,700-mile line of marine defences that stretched from Norway to the Pyrenees, and in a deranged fit of triumphalism, it isn't difficult to picture, he earmarked more than 10 per cent of all the concrete and iron used in its construction for the tiny and strategically irrelevant Channel Islands. </p> <p>But there's only so much bitterness to be distilled from a four-year occupation, and the men of Jersey cultivate a far deeper animosity towards their neighbour Guernsey, a rivalry dating back to the Civil War and beyond. </p> <p>'They went Roundhead,' called out Arthur with gleeful scorn, the cue for a detailed portrayal of the Guernseyman as horny-handed rustic, tending spuds and tomatoes with bovine deliberation as his worldly and debonair rival over the water diversifies lucratively into international finance. </p> <p>With its stunted, pastel-painted buses, sun-kissed expat ambience and all those offshore banks, the Jersey we cycled through seemed a lot further away than it was; I could almost have imagined us in Bermuda. There's the same sense of slight financial iffiness, and the same sense that they're compensating for it by governing all other areas of island life with a buttoned-up, rule-bound propriety. '12 hours parking in any 24 hours' read the signs along St Brelade's Bay, and if anyone's going to dispatch the nocturnal warden patrols required to enforce such a ludicrous restriction, you can be sure it'll be some mallard-manacling Jersey Seigneur. </p> <p>Accordingly, its tax exiles are lured from the low-octane end of the celebrity scale: when I asked Arthur to name and shame revenue outlaws holed up in the island's low, green hills, the best he could manage was Alan Whicker and Gilbert O'Sullivan. </p> <p>At the Hamptonne Country Life Museum the children watched smocked and bonneted women spinning wool: if you want to tell a genuine Jersey jersey, look for diamond patches under the arms. (Though be aware that they're sometimes made from dog hair.) Here too they acquired a smattering of the yokelly-Gallic patois, a reminder that though the French have had no presence in Jersey for 800 years, their language was dominant until the early 20th century. 'There isn't a distinctive local accent, though,' said Arthur, in a distinctive local accent. Jersey is mild Wurzel stretched with a curious antipodean twang. </p> <p>After a day and a half of billion-watt ultraviolet, it was almost a relief to throw back the curtains the next morning to find the horizon fuzzed out by a sea fog. Back in the hire car - despite my best efforts to extract full value, we'd hand it back with 21 miles on the clock - to the stoutly right-on Durrell Wildlife: 'The zoo that's not a zoo.' It is, of course, but generously proportioned and sympathetically landscaped enclosures make for less troubled-looking inmates than is the case in most such establishments: all those happy young faces pressed temptingly up to their fence, yet not one of the many primates responded with the traditional ejaculation. </p> <p>For anyone with a UKTV History habit as life-blighting as mine, a visit to the Jersey War Tunnels is obligatory. When the Nazis' East European slave labourers had built all they could on the island's surface, they were set to work beneath it, hacking out half a mile of bomb-proof tunnels for artillery storage and a military hospital. The complex has now been impressively converted into an exhibition on the island's occupation - an intriguing story, imaginatively told. </p> <p>As you walk into the exhibition's cool - no, cold - dark mouth, you're handed the facsimile of a real wartime identity card, featuring a sour Jersey countenance to be matched with its owner somewhere on display. I found my tattooed priest glowering defiantly at me from a glass case in the last chamber: there I read he'd been caught with a radio under his floorboards and perished in a prison camp. No happy endings for the others either, much to the delight of tragedy buff Lilja. </p> <p>After Kristjan discovered my camera's monochrome mode, his sister spent almost an hour honing expressions of appropriate pathos beside life-sized cutouts of her doomed island brethren. We all enjoyed it except Valdis, who welled up badly before a caption detailing the predictable fate of 6,000 pets abandoned on the quayside when their owners fled to the mainland. </p> <p>Late afternoon saw us down at the island's south-west tip for a low-tide walk out to Corbi\u00e8re lighthouse with marine biologist Andrew Syvret. Stumbling between rock pools across the pinkish granite that paves the streets of Westminster, we gleaned what we could from those parts of his commentary not brutally censored by brain-dislodging blasts from the lighthouse foghorn. Nearly all the UK's lobsters live in Jersey waters, it seems, along with half the dolphins and the detritus of an exciting proportion of our most terrible nautical tragedies. Then hotfoot, or wet-foot, back across the causeway as the sea turned on us: the Channel Islands are home to some of the world's most reckless tides. 'At low water,' panted Kristjan as we jogged past the rising rock pools, 'Jersey's effective land area is doubled.' </p> <p>You'll spot the lighthouse on the back of a Jersey fiver, and so will the unsmiling shopkeepers of mainland Britain when you make the mistake of taking seven back home with you. (After alienating most neighbourhood tradespeople with my inept dupery at their tills, I finally managed to offload the lot on a hapless bureau-de-change cashier at Helsinki airport.) </p> <p>Still, it's swings and roundabouts with Jersey's paper-based denominations. By keeping faith with the \u00a31 note, the island bank has endeared itself to parents of today's fiscally fixated children. Even the most tirelessly grasping examples of this breed - and I have fathered two - can be stunned into overwhelmed silence with a crisp note in their hands. Attempt to placate those shrill demands at the seaside crap stall with a hair-ruffling jingle of change - even one of superior value - and see those beastly faces contort into gurns of painful scorn. </p> <p>Bribed and soothed by the cash and sun that define the island, after a last evening on that stupendous beach the children were at last fully compatible with Jersey's sense of well-heeled, well-ordered civic compliance. Watching as they quietly transferred food from plate to mouth, we began to wonder where all those pent-up decibels had gone. In the morning, of course, we found out. 'Jesus,' I muttered croakily, forcing my earplugs further in to blot out a squawking, flailing hysteria that screamed out of their open windows and filtered in through ours. 'Sounds like they're wrestling a bloody seagull.' Birna wearily rolled out and trudged off to bring them to heel, returning at a different speed to inform me that, in fact, they actually were.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tim Moore's latest book, Spanish Steps: One Man and his Ass on the Pilgrim Way to Santiago, is published on 26 August by Cape at \u00a316.99.

  "As he likes to point out, with a mischievous smile, David Blunkett is a Gemini: a star sign that, he says, reflects the two sides of all of us. Last week the revelation of his affair with Kimberly Fortier, the wealthy publisher of The Spectator, for the first time allowed the public to glimpse the Home Secretary's other side, one shown usually only to close friends - that of an earthy man, with a genuine appreciation for the pleasures of the senses. <p>This Blunkett, say friends, is a man devoted to good red wine and rare jazz records, and a thrower of lively dinner parties. Perhaps unsurprisingly for a man raised largely by his mother after the death of his father when he was 12, he is easy in the company of high-powered, feisty women: regulars at his table range from the gregarious and gossipy Children's Minister Margaret Hodge, plus her judge husband Henry, to Downing Street aide Sally Morgan and her barrister husband John.</p> <p>Such doyennes of the Islington supper circuit might be expected. But the past week has shone an intriguing spotlight on a more surprising circle of friends - a network that stretches from one of Britain's most aristocratic families, to the editor of a powerful right-wing newspaper much disliked in Downing Street, to the north London literati.</p> <p>One acquaintance last week recalled a raucous dinner party at which Blunkett was seated next to Kathy Lette, the novelist famed for her racy sex scenes, whose circle of intimates includes fellow Australian Kylie Minogue and the domestic goddess Nigella Lawson, as well as the left-leaning barrister friends of her husband, the human rights QC Geoffrey Robertson. Lette, the guest recalls, was jokily flirting with Blunkett: and the more outrageous her behaviour became, the more delighted he grew. It is perhaps not hard to see how the plain-speaking politician from Sheffield and Fortier, the bubbly American could have grown close.</p> <p> Any tourist passing through a certain Derbyshire village last weekend would have little idea that one of its cottages was about to become a focal point of a sizzling tabloid summer spectacular.</p> <p>But last Sunday the nation learnt from the News of the World that this cottage, whose precise location cannot be reported for security reasons, was where Blunkett shared romantic 'liaisons' with Fortier, the married mother of a two-year-old son. </p> <p>The minister's affair set the red tops ablaze with tales of passion and betrayal that were further stoked when it emerged that the ambitious Fortier was five months pregnant. </p> <p>Conspiracy theories abounded on how a Labour cabinet minister ended up entangled with the wealthy New York debutante who ran the weekly magazine considered the inhouse bible of the Conservative party. </p> <p>While details of how the tryst became public remain unknown, in some ways the mystery is that it took so long: the couple have been regularly seen together at parties. Perhaps it was only because the prospect of Blunkett having a secret lover seemed so unthinkable that no one scented a scoop. </p> <p>Yet Blunkett's life story is full of unexpected twists. The working-class son of a gas board foreman who was born on a Sheffield council estate and despite his blindness became one of the most powerful men in Britain, his popular image was as the austere, almost monastic minister who spent every waking minute hunched over his ministerial red boxes. It was a public image that Blunkett appeared happy to cultivate. </p> <p>The couple are understood to have met at a private dinner party in autumn 2001. Fortier was recently married, to her second husband Stephen Quinn, the well-liked publisher of Vogue: their baby son William was born a year later. </p> <p>Blunkett's own rather unhappy marriage, to Ruth, had broken down in 1990 and, stung by the way in which his frank comments about the relationship in his 1995 autobiography were endlessly rehashed in newspapers, he resolved never to discuss his private life publicly for fear of upsetting his three sons. </p> <p>At first glance, Fortier and Blunkett were worlds apart: she was born into a wealthy family in Los Angeles, came to London in 1987 and climbed quickly through the ranks of magazine publishing, evolving into a sassy, vivacious power player in London's media village. </p> <p>Her job as publisher of the Spectator won her a place in Campaign magazine's media 'A-list' last year, in which she listed hotels among her dislikes: 'I don't like hotels - I always rent a house or flat, even in the weekend.' Whether or not she made her views clear to Blunkett is unknown. What is known is that, within a year of their meeting, he had started to make discreet inquiries about renting a weekend cottage in Derbyshire. </p> <p>His cosy romantic retreat is on the estate of the magnificent Chatsworth House, one of Britain's most spectacular stately homes, and is one of a number of cottages owned by the family of the Duchess of Devonshire - a personal friend. A more unlikely relationship is hard to imagine than that between the former leader of the 'People's Republic of Sheffield' and Deborah 'Debo' Mitford, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, sister-in-law of the British Fascist leader Oswald Mosley and the only surviving sister of the celebrated Mitford clan. </p> <p>Blunkett was close not only to the duchess but to her late husband, the 11th duke, who died in May this year. Unlike her sisters Diana and Unity - devoted followers of Hitler - and Jessica, a lifelong Communist, 'Debo' has always been resolutely apolitical: her published works, including Counting My Chickens ... and Other Home Thoughts, make little mention of the world outside Chatsworth's gates. While she lists her occupation as 'housewife' in the Companies House register, she runs a multi-million-pound business centred on the house and gardens: her great passions are food and animal husbandry. </p> <p>It came as something of a surprise, therefore, when she agreed at the beginning of July to host a summit of EU justice ministers at Chatsworth, to discuss immigration, cross-border crime and terrorism. A Home Office spokeswoman says the duchess 'had offered as a personal favour to host a dinner in recognition of the importance of the event. We paid a small amount as a contribution to the dinner.' </p> <p>The venue was, she says, chosen because of its 'strong personal significance' to the Home Secretary. Like Margaret Hodge's family cottage in Norfolk, and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Beverly Hughes's bolthole in the Lake District - both of which he borrows for discreet breaks - his cottage in the heart of rambling country is a refuge from the pressures of London life. A keen walker, he has described how, although he cannot see the view from a hilltop, he can sense the changing quality of the air. His other passion is cycling on tandems, often around Majorca and with his three grown-up sons, of whom he is fiercely protective: he is quickly moved to anger if his ex- wife is described as a single parent, insisting that, divorced or not, the couple will always be joint parents.</p> <p>Lately, however, his holiday tastes have grown more adventurous. In June he celebrated his 57th birthday in a villa at St Stefano, Corfu, with Fortier and her toddler son William: other details have begun emerging, of holidays on the Caribbean island of St Lucia. </p> <p>Ever the stickler for the rules, Blunkett declares in the House of Commons register an upgrade received from Virgin Atlantic on a flight to the romantic island last October, although it is not known whether Fortier was with him. He stayed at the luxury Hotel Capri, his second visit. Neatly inscribed in the hotel guestbook is an entry from his previous trip on 7 April, 2002, from a 'David Blunkett, Sheffield, England', praising his 'memorable holiday, the sun, food, sea but above all hospitality was first class'. </p> <p>The guestbook also discloses an entry from one Paul Potts - the chief executive of the wire agency the Press Association and an old friend of Blunkett's from Sheffield - who is holidaying with him again this week in Italy. </p> <p>The two have known each other for decades, becoming friends when the Home Secretary was leader of Sheffield council and Potts was a local reporter. While Potts, like Blunkett, used to be a left-wing firebrand he changed his political allegiance to the Tories - and was once tipped as a potential press chief to John Major - but the friendship appears to have survived unscathed. </p> <p>He is not the only media figure Blunkett counts as a friend. Last March he was guest of honour at a glittering dinner at London's Savoy Hotel to celebrate 10 years of Paul Dacre's editorship of the Daily Mail . In a speech to the 200-strong gathering, Blunkett described Dacre as 'a man who reflects the best of journalism', adding that he needed to read the paper 'to find out what is going on in my department, then seek immediate medical attention. I owe you one, even if it's just a left hook'. He then asked the audience to 'lift your glasses to Paul Dacre, editor of the year'. </p> <p>The two meet every few months, often for private dinners: their alliance was forged when Blunkett was Education Secretary and given to pronouncements on the value of parenting - including the suggestion that children should go to bed at regular times - which played into Dacre's strong sense of family values. </p> <p>If Blunkett finds himself sought out by such media players, it is perhaps little surprise: he has become the most important powerbroker in cabinet after Gordon Brown - and, intriguingly, perhaps the only Blairite loyalist who could also shine in a Brown administration. Blair, say aides, listens increasingly closely to Blunkett not just because his portfolio, from immigration to crime and terrorism, lies at the heart of an increasingly security-dominated election campaign but because he trusts Blunkett's gut instincts. The two share what other ministers regard as an innate social conservatism: Blair's recent speech, blaming the swinging Sixties for the ills of modern undisciplined society, was heavily influenced by conversations with Blunkett. </p> <p>Such views may be flung back at him this weekend. But Blunkett has remained resolutely silent on the issue: aides have flatly refused to discuss the relationship, except to confirm reports last week that the Home Secretary did contact the US Embassy to find out whom Fortier should telephone to get her son put on her American passport. </p> <p>It is not known whether the call came ahead of a holiday with Blunkett himself. But so far, it is the only known example of the two sides - private and public - of the Home Secretary's life colliding. This Gemini may not be able to keep them separate forever.</p>",

  "<p>If you were seeking a case study in schadenfreude, then last week's coverage of the Google flotation in the financial media could hardly be bettered. There were acres of solemn coverage recycling the opinions of investment bankers to the effect that the young geeks who run Google had had their comeuppance. </p> <p>After pondering the results of the Dutch auction, in which would-be investors were invited to bid for shares, the company sharply cut the number it was offering then set the price in the band of $85-$95 a share - considerably lower than the top of the $108-$135 range it had once expected. </p> <p>This valued the company at $24.4 billion, down from the $33bn it would have been worth at the mid-point of the earlier price range. Wall Street could barely contain its glee at this turn of events, and the financial media duly reflected its vindictive sentiments. </p> <p>To understand the bile, you have to know the background. Google has always been an unusual company, and when the time came for a float, it approached the task in an unorthodox way. This basically involved repudiating the corrupt way in which technology IPOs had traditionally been handled by Wall Street. </p> <p>Hitherto, what happened was this. (There's a wonderful description of the process in Po Bronson's book The Nudist on the Late Shift.) A technology company would go cap in hand to the Street's bankers and brokerage houses, often doing six months of elaborate presentations, beseeching these guys to take some of the shares. </p> <p>The institutions would then take large blocks of shares and parcel them out among favoured big clients. Small investors were entirely excluded and were generally unable to get even small allocations prior to the launch. </p> <p>Meanwhile the banks' analysts - eagerly abetted by the financial press - would hype the impending flotation, creating a frenzied mob of salivating customers awaiting Launch Day. </p> <p>Come the day, and thousands of small investors would pile into the market, often driving the share price to insane levels in the first hours of trading. At which point, the aforementioned clients of the aforementioned institutions unloaded their allocations, pocketed vast profits, and walked away. </p> <p>It was money for jam, as easy as taking candy from babies - and was how the technology boom of the late 1990s worked. </p> <p>With the bursting of the bubble, this source of easy pickings dried up. But when the prospect of Google's flotation was mooted, however, Wall Street began salivating again. Given the company's dominance of its market, this would be a Really Big One. Google would be worth zillions - I can remember numbers such as $15bn, $30bn and even $50bn being bandied about by respectable sources. </p> <p>But then Google snubbed the Street, turned its back on the flotation racket and instituted instead a Dutch auction in which the price of its shares would be set by what individual small investors said they were willing to pay. </p> <p>To add insult to injury, the Google prospectus also revealed that the company's shareholding structure would be arranged in such a way that it would continue to be run by its founders, rather than dominated by the short-term obsessions of institutional shareholders and Wall Street analysts. And the co-founders declared that the company's motto would be 'do no evil' - at which point investment bankers had to go and lie down in darkened rooms. </p> <p>The fury of the US financial establishment at Google's cheek had to be seen to be believed. Wall Street never likes to be mocked and has no experience at all of being denied anything that it sees as its rightful plunder. </p> <p>From then on, a baleful spotlight shone on Google as it inched towards flotation. There were some cock-ups - for example, over share options and an interview that the co-founders gave to Playboy - which were gleefully seized upon and reported. </p> <p>We suddenly began to hear mutterings about the 'threat' of competition from other search engines, not to mention Microsoft. Then came the magic moment when the Google team announced they were setting the price much lower and selling fewer shares - at which point Wall Street's cup ran over. Those Stanford brats had finally been taught a lesson. </p> <p>But hang on a minute. What's happened is that Google set a price based on serious empirical evidence (provided by the auction) rather than finger-in-the-wind guesstimates of investment bankers and bent analysts. </p> <p>Sure, this values the company at less than the wilder fantasies of Wall Street, but also means that a dotcom has finally come to market with a realistic initial valuation. </p> <p>This is a great advance on the nonsense we saw in the 1990s, when companies with no profits and few employees were briefly more valuable than General Electric (and in some cases are now worth less than stock exchange minnows). </p> <p>And guess what? On its first day of trading, Google shares went up to $100, better than the $95 which was the top end of Google's final estimate. Smart lot, the Dutch auctioneers. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>On the morning of 11 September 2001, a young man travelling from Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco called his girlfriend in Germany. </p> <p>She was in hospital, recuperating from a minor operation. He had, however, phoned her almost every day during his 15 months in America. Their relationship appeared to have survived early difficulties and their separation - he had made several long flights to visit her and she had once come to be with him in Florida - and they planned to marry. His parents were so pleased that they had already bought the couple a wedding present - a brand-new Mercedes. </p> <p>The phone call from an airport payphone that morning was brief. The young man simply said 'I love you' three times. Nothing more. Then he hung up. Shortly afterwards he boarded United Airlines flight 93 and was shown to seat 1B in first class. Soon after take-off, at about 9.25am, he and three other passengers tied scarves around their heads, then seized control of the plane. </p> <p>The young man was Ziad Jarrah, one of the team of 19 suicide bombers who, on that bright autumn morning, changed the course of the 21st century. </p> <p>In the days after the attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, all of us had a lot to take in: the disaster-movie footage of the jets crashing into the towers and people throwing themselves to their deaths. Hardly had we time to process these images than we had to work out what it all portended. What organisation was behind the attacks? What would the Bush administration do? </p> <p>With the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq came new and more complicated questions, of legality, morality, justice and political good sense. The story moved quickly on from Jarrah and his co-conspirators who, despite the millions of words written about 9/11, remain for the public little more than ciphers, recalled, if at all, only by mug shot. </p> <p>Towards the end of 2001, I received a call from the London-based independent production company Mentorn, which asked if I would be interested in writing a drama telling the story of 9/11 from the point of view of the hijackers. Channel 4 was apparently keen to back the project. </p> <p>Later I talked to the team behind the project. I considered myself reasonably well informed but, as I listened to Alice Perman, who later collaborated with me on the script, I became aware of how little I actually knew about the hijackers. </p> <p>I found myself more and more curious. The idea was to focus on the 'Hamburg cell' of young Muslim radicals who chanced to come together in the German town and who were to supply three of the four 9/11 pilots and organise much of the logistical back-up for the operation. How did these young men turn from students into martyrs? To understand what is happening in the world now we need as full a picture as possible. I agreed to write the script. </p> <p>The most promising point of entry into the closed world of the Hamburg cell, dramatically speaking, was in the shape of Jarrah. Drama's lifeblood is dilemma and conflict. The burning certainty possessed, say, by Mohamed Atta, the Egyptian hijacker who flew American Airlines flight 11 into the first of the twin towers, does not work well: the true believer never has to explain, he shouts down rather than debates, and never admits to doubt. </p> <p>Jarrah was born on 11 May, 1975, into a well-to-do family with homes in Beirut and the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. His parents were not observant Muslims, and young Ziad, an outgoing, friendly boy, went to private Catholic schools. Nothing suggested he took his nominal religion seriously. He went out with girls, drank alcohol and visited nightclubs. </p> <p>In 1996 Jarrah and his cousin, Salim, went to Germany on student visas to continue their education. Arriving in the economically depressed town of Greifswald - his uncle, Assem, was already there - Jarrah's early impressions of Germany were not positive. </p> <p>Jarrha was not much taken with his course, but fell in love with a fellow college student, a young woman of Turkish parentage, Aysel Senguen. There was an undertow of anti-immigrant feeling in the town. Bored, isolated and with few friends, Jarrah started to attend prayer meetings at the college organised by an older student, Abdulrahman al-Makhadi. This was to be his first step on the road to 9/11. Makhadi called Jarrah a 'weak Muslim' who didn't know how to say his prayers. </p> <p>Given Jarrah's indifference to religion, it was interesting to explore why he would seek the company of observant Muslims. Perhaps it was the special hospitality of the Arab world: where Greifswald offered at best indifference, and at worst racist hostility, the prayer group welcomed him as a brother. </p> <p>The more I read of Islam and talked to observant Muslims, the more I was struck by the idea of brotherhood in the Koran's powerful social message. In the ideal version of Islam, all men are brothers, all women are sisters, and all are part of a community. </p> <p>While making the film, I watched a Muslim adviser rehearse with the actors. He showed them how to line up for prayer, instructing them to put their feet together, side by side, touching, so 'nothing will come between you'. That way they would be strong enough to resist the devil. He told them: 'The Prophet said, \"Always the help of Allah is with the group. Don't let yourself be alone.\"' It was in the prayer room that the lonely Jarrah found brothers and an authenticity he suspected his life had lacked. For all his spoilt-boy swagger, Jarrah was stricken by self-doubt ('a tree without roots' was how a relative would later describe him to our researchers). </p> <p>The good-looking, wealthy, party boy had been brought up during Lebanon's vicious civil war. He had played football with kids from the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Chatila, before the camps were devastated by the Ariel Sharon-inspired massacres. Jarrah, of course, knew about the war and the massacres but, as a privileged child, he was not touched by them. </p> <p>His new brothers included Palestinians, men who spoke fiercely about injustice and oppression experienced at first hand. Nothing in his experience could match the authenticity of Arab agony they talked of; all Jarrah could offer was zeal. 'I want my life to count for something,' he told a friend of Aysel. </p> <p>He was changing and being pulled in two directions. He remained powerfully attracted to Aysel, and would not give her up, though their relationship was, in Muslim eyes, illicit. At the same time he was being drawn ever closer to his new brothers. It is tempting to portray his 'strange friends' - as Aysel would later call them - as manipulators cynically befriending a vulnerable young man. </p> <p>During rehearsals, director Antonia Bird, Alice and I encouraged the actors to try to imagine the world from the viewpoint of the characters they were playing. From this perspective, Jarrah appears not as a potentially useful tool, but as someone who is lost and to whom his brothers owe a duty to bring back to God and God's laws. This is an important distinction. Without it, we cannot understand the attraction to serious young Muslims of the solidarity found in radical mosques and prayer groups. </p> <p>We do not know exactly when Jarrah first came to Hamburg, but by early 1998 he had been introduced to two men who would have a dramatic impact on his fate: Mohamed Atta, a slightly older Egyptian who had come to the city in 1992 to further his studies after graduating in architecture from Cairo University; and Ramzi Binalshibh, a Yemeni asylum seeker who, in order to stay in Germany, had enrolled as a student. Both men were devout and, unlike Jarrah, lived strictly in line with the laws of Islam. To use the cell's terminology, they had 'put God at the centre of their lives'. </p> <p>Together, Atta and Binalshibh held discussion groups and prayer meetings in rooms at the local al-Quds mosque, which was to become the hub of the Hamburg cell. It would be tempting to present them as lieutenants for terrorist masterminds, carefully grooming potential recruits, but Atta and Binalshibh were on their own journeys and, though they were further on than Jarrah, they still had some way to go. </p> <p>While astonishingly single-minded, Atta and Binalshibh were in some respects quite naive. Binalshibh was an engaging, even charismatic young man, well liked by those who attended his meetings. Atta, by contrast, was strange and reserved. Most of the westerners who met him, in Germany and America, took an instant dislike to what they saw as his arrogant and aloof personality. </p> <p>In trying to create characterisation from lives glimpsed from recollection, the writer looks for a set-piece or revealing exchange - sometimes banal - that seems to sum up the man. For me, this came in the account by two young Germans who shared student lodgings with Atta. They describe his utter indifference to creature comforts. For food, Atta would throw unpeeled potatoes into a pot and, when it boiled, mash them into a bowl. He would eat his fill, which was not much, then keep the bowl in the fridge, returning to it as his appetite demanded. </p> <p>The image of Atta joylessly spooning cold mashed potato into his mouth, taken with everything else we know, strongly suggested a man for whom this world mattered little. By the time Jarrah met him, almost certainly in 1997, Atta was probably thinking of martyrdom. </p> <p>Atta's two fellow students also recall him being so upset by a poster of a Degas nude that he asked them to remove it from the wall. Atta never had sex, and displayed no serious interest in women. Muslim girls, he said, were too forward, wearing their hijabs as fashion items rather than garments of modesty. </p> <p>In his will, Atta expressly prohibited any woman from coming to his grave. He ordered that his genitals must not be touched during the preparation of his corpse. To a man so at odds with his body, so uncomfortable with the carnal, the idea of immolation, the complete destruction of the sinful reality of his own flesh, must have appealed: there would be no corpse to view and, one suspects the reasoning went, no imperfections for his enemies to mock. </p> <p>In Hamburg, where he enrolled to study aeronautical engineering, Jarrah continued to live a double life. His relationship with Aysel was difficult. The two underwent a marriage ceremony in a Hamburg mosque - their parents were not told - but did not even live in the same town (Aysel had moved from Greifswald to Bochum). She resented the time he spent with his new friends and was fearful of their influence over him. As she continued to live a western lifestyle, he rebuked her for not being a good Muslim. They quarrelled often and there were periods of separation. Once he hit her. </p> <p>Jarrah was spending an increasing amount of time with the group around Atta and Binalshibh, which now included Marwan al-Shehhi, a student from the United Arab Emirates who would pilot the second plane into the twin towers. Their circle was closed and mutually reinforcing. They prayed and talked politics, they listened to the preaching of favoured imams, and watched videos, made and distributed by radical Islamic groups, showing atrocities committed against Muslims in Bosnia, Chechyna and Palestine. </p> <p>In our film, we show only the briefest of clips, for the carnage on display is so sickening that most western viewers simply wouldn't be able to stomach it. For Jarrah and his friends, however, the images were sickening in a different sense: here was evidence of a new holocaust, against Muslims and denied by the world. The question for Jarrah and the others then became: what were they going to do about it? </p> <p>Radical Islamists argue there is a Koranic obligation on every able-bodied Muslim male to train for jihad. For many years this was academic, as it was hard to find somewhere to train. But once the Taliban took power in Afghanistan, thousands of young Muslim men - many of them from Britain - went to train in camps set up by the Taliban, al-Qaeda and other fundamentalist organisations. </p> <p>Their popular image is of dedicated fighters perfecting their combat skills. But for a large proportion of the recruits, training for jihad was little more than a rite of passage. After they had fulfilled their obligation, they returned home - to Birmingham, Marseille or Hamburg - not as terrorist sleepers waiting to be re-activated, but as law-abiding citizens. </p> <p>A minority, however, were prepared to go on to fight God's enemies, in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Chechnya. An even smaller minority were prepared to go all the way. At the end of 1999, Ziad Jarrah took a momentous step on his journey to 9/11. He followed Atta, Binalshibh and Shehhi in volunteering for a martyrdom operation, as yet unspecified. </p> <p>For one man, the timing was perfect. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, or KSM, al-Qaeda's director of operations, had been considering using planes as missiles. In the spring of 1999 Osama bin Laden approved the plan and introduced KSM to two men who, like Jarrah, had volunteered for martyrdom: they were Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, both Saudis who had fought in Bosnia. </p> <p>KSM initially envisaged putting a blizzard of planes into the sky, attacking simultaneously on the east and west coasts of America. The problem was finding enough suitable men. Any number of jihadis were willing to blow themselves up, but KSM's operation required technical competence, familiarity with western manners, reasonable English and steady nerves. They would have to get into the US, surviving visa background checks. This drastically reduced the number of potential candidates. </p> <p>Jarrah was perfect, however. Re-emerging in Germany after training in Afghanistan, he went to see Aysel. At first, she angrily demanded to know where he had been. Jarrah told her he had been in Afghanistan to fulfil his obligation to train for jihad. His duty done, they could now have a proper wedding in front of their parents and start a family. He would get a job: he was going to America to train as a pilot. </p> <p>It is likely that most of the conspirators had details of the plot drip-fed to them as the need arose. It is equally likely that they speculated on the nature of their mission, and - putting martyrdom and planes together - had a fair idea of what they would be asked to do. It was only a question of when and where. </p> <p>Incriminating visas and entry stamps in the passports of Jarrah, Atta, Binalshibh and Shehhi had to go. The passports were replaced with clean documents, and the men applied for visas to enter the US. Only Binalshibh was refused. Over the summer of 2000 Jarrah, Atta and Shehhi arrived in America and went to Florida for flight training. </p> <p>The two separate groups - Atta's in Florida, al-Hazmi and Mihdhar in San Diego - learnt to fly. KSM, with Binalshibh who commuted between Germany, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the UK, Malaysia and Spain, organised support, money and men to subdue passengers and crew once the jets had been seized. </p> <p>KSM realised the lack of suitable people meant cutting the number of targets, which were finalised in discussions with bin Laden. By the end of 2000 Jarrah, Atta and Shehhi had pilot's licences. They felt ready to strike, but KSM had problems. A new pilot, Hani Hanjour, had to be sent after al-Hazmi and Mihdhar broke off their training. Other key operatives were unable to get visas. </p> <p>Now simmering tensions between Atta and Jarrah - always unlikely comrades - came to the boil in the summer of 2001, principally because Atta disapproved of Jarrah's relationship with Aysel. Jarrah made several trips to Ger many and to see his family in Lebanon, and Atta suspected he wanted to pull out. It took all Binalshibh's persuasive powers to get him to stay. </p> <p>One inevitably speculates on their state of mind. They were living under sentence of death, albeit self-imposed. Atta was not strongly attached to this life. Little in it seemed to please him. But if we can read anything into a photograph used by the media after 11 September, he seemed under acute pressure, his eyes hollow and shadowed, his face gaunt. Yet Shehhi, it seems, was cheerful to the last, often dreaming of the paradise promised to martyrs. </p> <p>Jarrah's last days suggest he lived a fantasy in final calls to Aysel and his parents. He was due to fly to Lebanon to attend a wedding. He told his father he had the ticket and had bought a new suit. In calls with Aysel he continued to plan their future. It was all a lie. </p> <p>On the morning of 11 September, he and three accomplices left the Day's Inn Hotel in Newark and caught the shuttle to the terminal. Ziad Jarrah was setting out on his final journey. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 'The Hamburg Cell' by Ronan Bennett and Alice Perman, directed by Antonia Bird, is to be screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival on Wednesday and Thursday.

  "<p>Genoa, the Italian Ipswich; this was my first impression of my new home as a teacher of English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Most holidaymakers come, see, but do not conquer, returning wearily to their lives and jobs. But with 120 hours of instruction, six to eight hours' observation of classes taught by professionals and six hours' assessed teaching practice under his or her belt, the successful EFL trainee can keep the Chianti flowing forever. </p> <p>Every year 12,000 people worldwide study for the best known EFL qualification, the Cambridge CELTA (Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults). Within a month (for an intensive, all-day-every-day course) or three to six months (for part-time courses running over two or three evenings a week), anyone over 20 possessing a standard of English that would equip them to embark upon a university education could be jetting off for a spell of student-induced sweaty upper lips and photocopied handouts left on the kitchen table. </p> <p>Prices for the CELTA course vary wildly. Depending on the size and reputation of the school, and its ability to help you find a job (often within one of its own international branches), you can pay between \u00a3600 and \u00a31,100. Studying for the certificate abroad is one attractive option, although the cost of accommodation and the glamour of the location (Barcelona and Rome are popular choices) can bump up the fee. </p> <p>Most of my EFL friends would admit that their command of English at the start of the CELTA was nothing to write (ineptly) home about. But completing the course gives you the sense that (God bless the teachers' book!) you can wing it under pressure. </p> <p>Happily for non-grammarians, today's EFL is based on having fun. The goal is to teach English in the same way we learned it as children: from immersion in the language, from repetition, from gentle exposure to new things until our tiny minds can fully embrace them and use them with confidence. Even without the certificate, being a native English speaker can be enough to get you a job, but employers will tend to want you to have a university degree as proof of your general intelligence. </p> <p>When choosing a place to work, a rule of thumb is that the poorer the country, or the tighter or more desperate the employer, the less that will be demanded of you in formal professional terms. It is advisable to arrange employment before you leave Britain, although there are many cases of teachers being in the right place at the right time and finding work on spec. Vacancies can be found in The Guardian on Tuesdays, and on websites such as <a href=\"http://www.tefl.com\">www.tefl.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tefl.net\">www.tefl.net</a> teachers can hook up with schools within minutes, the time it takes to book a holiday online.</p> <p>Armed with the CELTA or the equally recognised Trinity College certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (Tesol), it is easy to get a job. It is not immediately easy to get a good job. The internet in particular can be a forum for schools whose staff-rooms have revolving doors, and telephone interviews with principals and directors of study (DoS) can be deceptive. </p> <p>You should always check the rate of pay before you agree to travel, and ask whether they can guarantee the number of hours a week you will be working. In parts of the world where the cost of living is low, such as eastern Europe, you can live like an EFL monarch, but you will find that any money you save will not go far when you return to the UK. In a country such as Italy, you can earn up to \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3676) a month, but this is dependent on the number of contact hours with students: all preparation will be voluntary and absolutely necessary if you wish to avoid having a sweaty upper lip every day. </p> <p>A guide to global earnings is at <a href=\"http://www.teflonline.net/job_prospects.htm\">www.teflonline.net/job_prospects.htm</a>. Typically teachers take 20-25 hours of classes a week, though some committed (or hard-up) souls flirt with insanity and undertake 30 or more. Only the most energetic and experienced manage to keep up standards at this work rate, and the repetition of classes at different levels and the re-use of teaching materials in different contexts can become an artform in itself. </p> <p>Ever the cynic, I never really bought the whole learning-is-fun shtick anyway, and knew my limits where classroom performance was concerned. I loved putting my personal stamp on lessons, and felt the thrill of competence when 30 faces looked up to me for guidance and inspiration. But I was often exhausted. </p> <p>By the time you have travelled from home to school, to in-house business English lesson on the edge of town, and back to school for the one-to-one evening conversation class with the argumentative and chauvinistic local chemist, you may begin to wish that you had asked more logistical questions in that first friendly chat with your prospective boss. </p> <p>Directors of study will naturally be sizing you up for the worst classes when you initially enquire about work. Even then, they will probably not want to commit themselves to hiring you until they are sure they have enough students, this being a bums-on-seats industry. </p> <p>Ring at the right time (usually September/October and to a lesser extent December for jobs in countries that follow a Western academic year), and the DoS will treat you like the second coming. Ring too early or too late, and they will act as sniffy as any Oxbridge col lege. Sight unseen, you will only find out where the nightmare schools and cushy numbers are when you actually live in your chosen location. </p> <p>Having taught for a year, you will either be brought home in a pedagogical body bag, complete with grammar games and flash cards, or you will have found a boy/girlfriend and/or a reasonable flatshare, and will know which classes to grab and which to refuse on pain of teaching the subjunctive. </p> <p>You will know the rogue schools and their weapons of class destruction, and will either start to take on lucrative private students culled from your classes, or decide you are adventurous and sufficiently well-equipped with stolen textbooks to take on a new challenge elsewhere. </p> <p>Next week, dear students, we will be looking at the possibilities for making EFL more than a blip on your CV, including the opportunities to become a DoS, a school owner, or that dream of EFL dreams, a permanent (if not always well-paid) traveller.</p>",
  "<p>It's never easy following the man who made the company. Often the man himself has left for a good reason, and, if it has turned into a sprawling empire, the company often ends up being broken up - see Hanson, Trafalgar House, Invensys. The hard act to follow at the moment is Sir Clive '20 per cent' Thompson, and the man working out what to do next is Rentokil's current chairman Brian McGowan. </p> <p>McGowan, who pushed Thompson off the board three months ago and followed this execution with that of CEO James Wilde, has the opportunity to stamp his authority on the company at Thursday's interim results presentation. </p> <p>Along with the numbers - which the company advised in the spring would reflect a slowdown in growth as margins narrowed because of investment in new staff and competition - McGowan will unveil the findings of his three-month strategic review. </p> <p>How he must crave the opportunity to outline a vision for the future that can be set in train now. The problem is that he can't. What is worse, everyone in the market knows what he needs to do: sell businesses that are peripheral to Rentokil's cleaning and pest control operations (as Thompson advised) - chiefly conferences, parcels and perhaps security. Together these are valued at as much as $1bn. He knows it too, most likely. But he is also trying to attract a chief executive to fill the post made vacant by the sacking of Wilde. McGowan can't afford to deprive the headhunters of the goodies they need to make a difficult appointment. So the Brian McGowan show is likely to be a bit of a disappointment next week. </p> <p>That does not mean Rentokil is a basket case. McGowan could comfortably tread water by raising the dividend, and if the market's near-unanimous view that a break-up is a certainty turns into reality, there would be up to \u00a31 billion to play with in a year or so's time. If you've got 'em, keep 'em. If not, watch out on Thursday, and watch that space.</p> <p><strong> Homes no longer hot property for Berkeley</strong></p> <p> It must be a sign: housebuilder puts 'For Sale' board up over its land bank. That's what Berkeley Group did earlier this summer. </p> <p>The City gulped at news that one of its sector favourites was ditching housebuilding to concentrate on becoming an urban regeneration company. It is difficult to interpret the move as anything but a vote of no confidence in the long-term sustainability of the UK's housing market. </p> <p>This week we'll see Persimmon, another of the sector's giants, report a bumper set of six-month figures, with profits up 20 per cent, and dividend payments up 18 per cent. But all ears will be on Persimmon's assessment of the market going forward. One boss of a leading developer last week said that prices will fall 15 to 20 per cent in the next two years. </p> <p>It is in this light that Berkeley's new strategy should be seen. Never mind that the top brass has devised a plan to return \u00a31.4bn to shareholders. Resist the urge to cry as shareholders look set to vote through a bonus scheme that would net a \u00a3100 million management windfall if targets are met. </p> <p>What is striking is Berkeley's decision to get out of housebuilding into an area traditionally more suited to a non-Plc. Regeneration is a less predictable and more volatile activity than housebuilding. Transforming run-down areas is inherently risky. However, if the timing is right, the rewards are hefty, which is why a number of UK institutional funds are looking to inject capital into inner city areas. </p> <p>But the Berkeley move out of housebuilding is a clear signal that worrying times are in store, not just for Britain's housebuilders but for Britain's property-owners as well.</p> <p><strong> Let your fingers do the walking away</strong></p> <p> The old Yellow Pages was a sleepy BT backwater until management woke up to its profit-making potential. Shortly afterwards, a growing debt mountain forced it to sell the business to a consortium of private equity groups, who floated it on the stock market three years ago. </p> <p>But the directories market is becoming more competitive and that may spell trouble for Yell, as the business is now known. Last week, the Office of Fair Trading announced a review into the price cap that restricts the amount it can charge advertisers several months earlier than expected. As things stand, Yell has to reduce its charges by 6 per cent a year in real terms to convince the authorities it is not abusing its virtual monopoly (it has nearly 85 per cent market share). Analysts expect this hefty burden to be increased when the next five-year formula is announced sometime next spring, despite a number of new entrants to the directories market. </p> <p>In the long term, competition will mean that the erosion of Yell's market-leading position is all but inevitable. Yet in the short term, it will continue to be closely regulated. That helps to explain why Yell's management is busy buying up overseas businesses with growth potential - particularly in America. </p> <p>The US market now accounts for around half of Yell's turnover and it is performing better than expected. But success abroad may not make up for less favourable prospects at home. Yell's shares closed at 343p on Friday, well above the 285p-per-share flotation price. Cautious investors may choose to bail out now.</p>",
  "I am thrilled to discover I have something in common with Oprah Winfrey. A few years ago, when I was first called up to perform jury service, I did what any good middle-class professional would do and dodged it. So did Oprah. I can't remember the exact excuse I used: I had to have my bikini line waxed, or the dog spayed. Something like that. <p>A few months later I was called up again, and again - just like Oprah - I found a reason to defer (ingrowing toenail that time, I think). The third time, though - just as Oprah did last week - I accepted my civic duty. And I'm very glad that I did. </p> <p>I was not as lucky as the queen of daytime talk. She landed herself a juicy murder trial, and stood in judgment on Dion Coleman, 27, whom she helped find guilty of shooting dead one Walter Holley over a forged 50 buck note. (Rather deliciously, she heard the case at the Cook County Courthouse, immortalised in the musical Chicago, itself a rumbustious satire about the melding of homicide, media and celebrity, which could stand as commentary on the circus surrounding Oprah's appearance in court last week.) </p> <p>My own case involved a falling out among old friends on a West London housing estate one Christmas night, during which one stabbed the other. It was neither a substantial stabbing - more a light nick to the shoulder - nor a substantial case, for the blade in question was of the tightly closed penknife variety, and the accused had only one functioning hand. The other was just a thumb and stump of palm.</p> <p>'That was the way I came out of my mum,' he told us, philosophically. 'No point being angry about it.' However hard the prosecution attempted to prove otherwise it was clear to us that the defendant could not have opened the knife in the way described and we acquitted him. </p> <p>Putting aside the pure voyeuristic pleasure of listening to the evidence - the how and why of who did what to whom and when (I'm sure you adored it too, Oprah) - there was, I found, something surprisingly satisfying about the process itself. </p> <p>Surprising, at least, to me since, before I took part, I had imagined jury service to be a bureaucratic drudge; something to be tolerated and endured rather than to be enjoyed for its own sake. That is why, like up to two-thirds of the middle class in Britain, I kept finding reasons not to do it. When I finally gave in, the experience became an object lesson in the virtues of both civic duty and democracy. </p> <p>There is, quite simply, something rather humbling about sitting among a group of your fellow citizens, and weighing the evidence against another of your number not in the room. It is both empowering and levelling, for in that situation the British vices of class snobbery and sneering over educational achievement have to be abandoned. There are 12 of you in the jury room and, though the usual group social dynamic will play its part, every person's opinion still counts. </p> <p>The jury I sat on seemed to me to be as average a cross-section of society as you could hope to find (albeit one short of the professional middle classes who were still then bunking off jury service like it was triple games at school). Though I was probably the most au fait with the functioning of the legal system, as a result of some experience as a court reporter - knowledge I pompously told them about - it didn't make the slightest bit of difference. </p> <p>Even after I forced my way into the foreman's seat in the arrogant hope that I might be able to speed up the process and get us all home in time for Countdown, it became clear to me that everybody was determined to have their say and would insist on having it, however hard I attempted to manage the debate. This had nothing to do with the people involved and everything to do with the jury system itself. Put 12 people in a court room. Tell them that everybody's opinion counts, and all 12 will make bloody sure that they make their contribution. </p> <p>For this reason, I firmly believe recent changes to the rules on jury service, much criticised by the legal profession, and designed, among other things, to end the middle-class opt out, can only be a good thing. Up until May of this year you were excused jury service if you were a judge or a barrister, a policeman or a solicitor or just about anyone else who could claim an intimate knowledge of the workings of the legal system. </p> <p>Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 those opt-outs were abolished. Already some very senior high court judges have taken their places on the jurors' bench. </p> <p>A key objection to the changes was over the inclusion of police officers. Surely, the critics said, the whole raison d'\u00eatre of working for the police is to secure convictions. How could they abandon that just because they had landed on a jury? To me, giving police a chance to see a different side of justice in practice seems a necessary corrective. </p> <p>One of the results of the middle-class opt-out has been the homogenisation of juries. The Old Bailey, the most famous and arguably the most important criminal court in the land, pulls its jurors from a patch of London directly to its south. </p> <p>It was common, in the time when I was reporting there, to hear the latest batch of 12 chosen to sit through a trial referred to, by both hacks and barristers alike, as a 'right old Bermondsey jury', and they didn't mean it in a good way. Generally white and working class, they were regarded as coming from the same social group and milieu as the defendants, and therefore less likely to prove sympathetic to the police. (The same lingua franca is used elsewhere. Snaresbrook court famously has its 'East End juries', Liverpool, its 'Scouse juries'.) </p> <p>So, a few police officers - and barristers, and marketing men and accountants for that matter - are only likely to benefit the process. While the critics continue to bang on, the government is stubbornly (and rightly) resisting any calls for a reversal. </p> <p>'The American experience where, in a number of states, judges, lawyers and others holding positions in the criminal justice system have sat as jurors for some time,' the Department of Constitutional Affairs said earlier this summer, 'is that their fellow jurors have not allowed them to dominate their deliberations.' </p> <p>Quite so. And the same doubtless goes for billionaire talk-show hosts. So welcome Citizen Oprah. You, like me, took a little while to get yourself into the court room, but now you've been there I'm sure you feel like a better person.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Mary Riddell is away</p>",
  "<p>At this stage of the year, dusk creeps forward week by week. Strange to think that only two months ago it was the longest day, light by four in the morning and still light enough to water the garden at 10 in the evening. In June, the sun sinks down in a notch just by the church tower that sits to our north. Now, almost daily, it is edging back westwards across the sky; by the winter solstice it will dip below the hedge almost at right angles to its midsummer high-tide mark. The quality of the evening light has changed too, becoming velvety. This is when white and its shades look at their best, shimmying out from the shadows like a barn owl slipping across the field. </p> <p>White plants are immensely popular, largely, I suspect, because they are a reminder of the incredible freshness and vitality of the natural frothing white and green display of the countryside in spring. I increasingly believe that gardens - especially town gardens - are our modern-day pocket countryside. But white plants can be tricky to place in a border, partly because as white flowers fade they become ugly brown rags that, unlike those of darker colours, must be deadheaded, and partly because of the effect they have on the plants around them, either diluting them or acting as spacers, dividing the other colours so that the flow of a border is lost. You can see why the concept of a white garden or border is attractive. However, as soon as the two words 'white' and 'garden' are conjoined, the spectre of Sissinghurst looms over them. </p> <p>I last wrote about white plants about nine years ago and throughout my piece I studiously avoided referring to Sissinghurst. It was then - and still is - an icon of everything most British gardeners aspire to. Because that aspiration is so heavily tinged with class and snobbery, I felt I should leave it aside. But it lurked beneath the piece like a rock at high tide. The truth is that Vita Sackville-West's white garden is one of the great horticultural masterpieces of the world and should be celebrated as such. It was one of the last pieces of the garden to be made, in the early 1950s, and was a long time in gestation. It was hardly an original idea. Lawrence Johnson had made a small, white garden at Hidcote with, among other things, white tulips, crambe, Campanula latiloba 'Alba' and the white Fuchsia magellanica 'Molinae'. But it is dominated by its hedges and topiary of yew, holly and box, and the flame flower, Tropaeolum speciosum, drips its red flowers down the green walls in high summer. There was also a white garden at Tintinhull, and Vita knew both these gardens well. But her interpretation of this theme surpasses anything done before or since. </p> <p>Of course, white flowers, like white anything, are rarely pure white. Set Cosmos 'Purity' or an Iceberg rose on fresh snow and it will have a creamy, ivory tint. A white plant that I have grown fond of this year is Gaura lindheimeri 'Whirling Butterflies', which is nominally white but has pink sepals. The delicate flowers float through a border and last a phenomenally long time. </p> <p>There is a large parade of familiar white flowers, from the first snowdrops in January, 'White Triumphator' tulips in April, the spring joy of damson, plum and pear blossom, the many white roses (Rosa rugosa 'Alba' and R alba semi-plena are my favourites), white lupins, tobacco plants, white poppies, white sweet peas, the floating haze of white flowers from Crambe cordifolia and Thalictrum aquilegifolium 'White Cloud' through to the final autumnal flowering of white cosmos, white snapdragons and Iceberg roses, and the white stems of Rubus cockburnianus in midwinter. </p> <p>But all these apparently white flowers need green to seem as white as possible. Green is the context that makes white look rich and ethereal. White flowers tend to have less form and bulk than darker colours - this is because white bleaches out into the space around the plant, whereas a rich red or purple creates a clearer volume - so a dark background crispens up the edges and creates volume. White also looks better within defined green shapes and contained areas. At Sissinghurst, this is done by edging the smaller beds with box hedges that are higher than the paths that divide them. This creates an effect of boxes out of which the white planting erupts and doubles the amount of green in the garden. It is a detail, but one of real genius. </p> <p>Silver foliage makes the area around it seem cool and ghostly, and combined with white the whole thing can be deliciously subtle and elegant. It is not silver, of course, but silvery. From the palest, chalky greens of artemisia, cardoons, eryngiums, Stachys byzantia or the 'blue' hostas like H sieboldiana or H 'Snowden', there is a good range of silvery, grey foliage to bring out the best in white flowers. One man's silver is another man's blue and in the end most foliage is a version of green. My own silvery, greeny, blue favourites to set among white flowers are Melianthus major, cardoon, onopordum, Eryngium giganteum (Miss Wilmot's Ghost') and Artemisia 'Valerie Finnis'. </p> <p>Finally, if you are planning a white border or even the whole bridal shebang of a white garden, think about its position. White in the middle of the day seems bleached and tired, and what is intended to be cool, elegant and mysterious simply becomes washed out. White gardens look wonderful at dawn and dusk, so follow the sun.</p>",
  "<p>Great Britain continued their magnificent weekend on the water today with a silver medal in the women's quad sculls.</p> <p>Alison Mowbray, Debbie Flood, Frances Houghton and Rebecca Romero followed yesterday's triple rowing haul with a gutsy performance to take silver. </p> <p>The Germans, Olympic champions since the event entered the Games in 1988, claimed gold again with the Ukraine quartet third. </p> <p>Germany started the quickest and moved into a half-length lead by the first 500m time-check. </p> <p>The British quartet - all with words like \"hands-up\" and \"smooth finish\" written on the back of their hands - then drove through from fifth place and had overtaken the Australians by 1500m. Lying second, they had the mighty Germans in their sights for the final 500m.</p> <p>Although Britain closed the gap they could not quite bridge it and Germany were once again, for the fifth successive time, Olympic quad sculls champions.</p> <p>\"I remember sitting on my friend's sofa in February wondering how I would ever get to the Olympic Games, and so to get a silver medal is absolutely fantastic,\" said Mowbray. </p> <p>Houghton admitted to having mixed feelings after the quartet had set their standards so high. </p> <p>\"It hasn't sunk in that I have got an Olympic medal,\" she said. </p> <p>\"I have really enjoyed it so far. I knew what I wanted, I just wanted to row as best I could.\" </p> <p>\"The Germans have never ever lost this event. We are there thinking: 'It's the Olympic final, we can make it ours', whereas they have done it time and time again and know what they are doing. </p> <p>\"I still think we can beat them though. I have time on my side but opportunities come and you never know when they are going to come up. </p> <p>\"Maybe if we hadn't aimed for that (Olympic gold) we wouldn't have landed where we are - aim for the moon and land on the stars.\"</p> <p>Romero, describing the quartet's race tactics, said: \"We knew that everyone was going to go for it early and that it would be a blanket line up front. </p> <p>\"Everyone was just waiting for us do our work later on but we knew it would take longer to get back in there as this is the Olympics.\"</p> <p>The result also took Britain to the 20-medal mark at the start of day nine - matching their tally in Barcelona back in 1992. </p> <p>Team chiefs will now be hoping that Britain can edge towards the 28-medal haul in Sydney four years ago.</p>",
  "When there's too much to take in at once, you focus on the small, often the surreal. The crew of the Port Isaac inshore lifeboat, which rounded the corner into Boscastle Harbour at the height of Monday's rescue, first remember many orange lights flashing through the biblical downpour; the cars floating past them may have been in their death-throes, but their alarms were working perfectly. <p>Late on Wednesday, as a rainbow settled over the valley and the salvage effort cranked into ever-louder gears, I took a wander through the devastation and stopped by a surviving sign on the door of the Wellington Hotel, right at the foot of Old Road, close to the epicentre. 'We respectfully ask that visitors kindly remove muddy boots before entering the hotel.' It proved hard to banish the thought 'Bit late now'. Later, I discovered that 33 animals had been rescued. A scattering of bedraggled cats and dogs, of varying photogenic cuteness, plus one cockatiel, five canaries, two hamsters and a pet rat. </p> <p>A pet rat? What on earth were they doing, our wonderful emergency services, hauling rats to safety? What they were doing, of course, was this: taking part in what was a peculiarly British disaster. A strangely perfect disaster. Crucially, no one died, not even the rat. Perfect strangers became perfect friends overnight. The (future) king visited and vowed to open the court coffers. D-Day was evoked. And Dunkirk. And Dad's Army. And for once this year our armed forces weren't dying horribly, shot in the back in the desert. They were back to being clever and brave and wise and strong, and saving us. And the Salvation Army was there afterwards to give them a nice cup of tea. </p> <p>Despite the terribly real fear of Monday itself, and the terribly real misery and hardship left in its wake, this was, in hindsight, something of a feelgood disaster, bringing out, as these things can, the best of British. I'm not being cynical, I'm delighted to be able to write this. Because it could easily have gone spectacularly, viciously, wrong. </p> <p>In 1312 William, Lord Botreaux, of Botreaux Castle, a small Norman community (later shortened to Boscastle) at the lush head of an inlet from the rough Atlantic, was granted a charter which gave him and his heirs feudal rights to, basically, run the place and its market for ever. The date on the charter was 16 August - the same date as the flash floods which, in 1952, killed 34 at nearby Lynmouth and, of course, the same date as last week's havoc. </p> <p>The community grew slowly but steadily. It became what's called a 'close-knit community', which in effect meant that, for centuries, strangers were regarded with close-knit hostility. In 1840 six vagrants tried begging in the street with organs and white mice; the local minister rewarded them with a month on the treadmill. The next year an 86-year-old match-seller known as Scotch Willy fell and broke his thigh. He lay all night unaided in a lane and died shortly afterwards. </p> <p>It all began to change in 1893. A station opened at Camelford, and tourists, and their money, began to arrive. Tourism received a huge boost in 1935 when Daphne du Maurier set Jamaica Inn on nearby Bodmin moor. A kind of 'southern Gothic' was born, and from that day on Cornwall's cream teas and gorgeous hedgerows have been sitting surprisingly easily with dark tales of wreckers and ghosts and bloodied moors to bring tourists in their much-needed millions to England's poorest county. </p> <p>They flocked, in particular, to Tintagel and nearby Boscastle. Tintagel itself - fabulous ruined clifftop castle, deeply dodgy myth - pulls in the most. It has one of those grim, tourist-laden, deep-fried high streets where no apostrophe can ever feel truly safe. There is something pinkly garish called Granny Wobblys Fudge Pantry, and near by they are selling Excaliburgers. But the cannier tourists, those with a bit of taste, went three miles east and down the headlong roads that take you to the coast, and Boscastle. It had impossibly cute humpy rooftops, the result of unseasoned timber bending under heavy slate for centuries. It had pretty pubs and hideaway lanes, and a better class of gift shop. </p> <p>It had, by all accounts, people who weren't just there to take your money but were genuinely friendly and welcoming. Emails and telegrams from around the world were arriving last week as testament. This was Boscastle - seemingly in perpetuity - until Monday afternoon. </p> <p>In the Environment Agency's flood control centre in Exeter, the violence of storms is represented on a radar screen through coloured pixels. Red means violent, mauve worse, white signifies the nastiest storms we'll have. On Monday afternoon a white square sat smack over Boscastle for two hours. </p> <p>The rest you possibly know. How a huge lump of warm, heavy, moist air from the tropics had sailed ashore right at Boscastle, to be met, most unfortunately, by a huge cold lump of British air already sitting there. How the wet tropical lump was thus forced swiftly up, to the point where it couldn't go any higher unless it relinquished its millions of gallons of water droplets. How the rain ran off the high moors - already waterlogged down to their slate floors - in sheets, and swelled the rivers to impossible fatness, and then just kept coming. </p> <p>It wasn't just the fact of the water, say villagers. Cold, yes, and in places deep, but not impossible to wade through if it hadn't been for the speed - 40 miles an hour at times. Anyone who has stood in mild surf, or fished a flowing river, knows how hard it is to keep your balance in a quarter of that, and how hard you fall. So they were forced to take to roofs and trees, and to wait. </p> <p>And here, despite the area's having lived rather profitably in the past for so long - a rural past, a golden age, an idyll of copious berries and friendly posties - it became, very quickly, wholly dependent on modernity - specifically that introduced by a Russian named Igor Sikorsky, who wanted to base a flying-machine not on the gliding principles of the gull but on the frantic aeronautics of the hummingbird. </p> <p>The helicopter is not quiet, and it's not desperately pretty. Fixed-wing pilots sneer that helicopters don't so much 'use' the air as simply beat it into submission. It is not, despite appearances, particularly easy to control either. Normal planes can be flown for a while with an occasional twitch from one hand, but a helicopter pilot is using all four limbs at all times - one hand on the collective, which controls speed and vertical position, the other on the cyclic, which controls direction. And both feet controlling the tail rotor, which makes the machine pivot. There were seven of them, at one point, in this tiny valley, and they lifted 80 people out of Boscastle in a little over two hours. </p> <p>This was the kind of emergency for which the crews train every other day of their working lives. And the wind wasn't an unbeatable problem. Helicopters can actually benefit from a steady headwind. But the visibility - down to 150ft because of the torrential rain - was a bugger. Grid references were dispensed with in communications. They would tell each other 'I'm south of the church' or 'hanging over the harbour mouth'. </p> <p>And the rest, the next few days, were predictable enough, for a Britain starved of feelgood news - tired of fake celebrities and longing for real humans. There were the damp-animal pictures; the extraordinary little tales of courage and stoicism. The friendships, and the tributes. And, towards the end of the week, a mild backlash, in print and on radio phone-in programmes: why were we getting so dramatic when nobody had died? Why was Britain - the Commonwealth, even - so swift to rally round, blankets being knitted from Aberdeen to Sydney, when we care so little at hundreds dying in floods in Bangladesh? And who was to blame? Should we have seen it coming? Who was at fault? </p> <p>It's not the Boscastleites asking these questions. 'A bit of coverage is fine, we need some publicity because it's been awful, but you boys always go too far,' I was told, repeatedly, in varying degrees. 'We're not blaming anyone - flood prevention couldn't have stopped this. We're just thankful no one died.' And then, as we sat in one of the town's hilltop pubs discussing reports of a hurricane heading, this weekend, for Devon and Cornwall, came the dry comment. 'We'll cope. After Monday, we'll cope. Worst thing is, we'll have you buggers back down again.' I felt like Scotch Willy, lying in the ditch. </p> <p>And then, later trudging uphill again, I stopped to help one woman, Gay Trusswell, with a heavy bag she was struggling to carry up the hill. 'Not from around here, are you,' she guessed, as I slung the plastic sack containing a thump of damp clothing over my shoulder. 'Journalist,' I wheezed, and she sighed, and we sensibly saved our breath for the climb, and at the top, the very top, she relented. 'What's actually in there?' I ventured. </p> <p>'Everything. Everything I have. Which was everything I stood up in.' </p> <p>'So ... your home's down there?' </p> <p>'No. It was. It was a mobile home. Now? Now it's somewhere in the North Atlantic.' She gave a crooked smile and thanked me genuinely, and we parted. And for all the reams written this past week - including this one - for all the feelgood factor enjoyed by the rest of Britain, and the blame and speculation and doom-mongering and plaudits the press enjoyed handing out, this sad little story and the other hundreds of individual tales are what Boscastle will really remember of the week they could do nothing about - because you can no more easily 'hate' weather than you can hate people. </p> <p>Robert Louis Stevenson had it about right, in his poem 'Storm'. He talks to storms, questions them, and ends with something approaching forgiveness when he addresses one thus: 'That are of all things in nature the nearest thoughts to human/Because you are wicked and foolish/Mad and destructive.'</p>",
  "<p>The Olympics came alive for Britain on Lake Schinias as their rowers gathered a hatful of medals under the blazing sun. It was a stunning gold by inches for the men's four, silver for the women's pair and bronze for the women's double scullers, demonstrating beyond doubt that Britain is indeed an island nation with a special affinity for water.</p> <p>It was Matthew Pinsent's fourth Olympic title, but it was so, so close. Canada pulled back to eighthundredths of a second at the finish after Britain had made a decisive break and seemed to have the race in hand. But Canada pushed hard near the end and Italy were closing. </p> <p>Neither crew knew who had won for fully three minutes after they crossed the line, and it was only the eruption of Union flags and cheering from the stands that told them the result of the photo. </p> <p>'Forty strokes out I saw we were behind and I thought, \"Right, let's nail it for 30 now\",' said Pinsent. 'Thirty strokes later I looked across and thought \"How are they still ahead of us?\" I couldn't believe it. I didn't think we'd won, although the surge of our final stroke felt right for the line.' </p> <p>It was an intensely moving moment as the tension of the past eight weeks finally broke, and the usually imperturbable Pinsent and the normally steely Ed Coode were still unable to control their tears 20 minutes later on the medal podium. </p> <p>'It's been a very emotional week,' said Pinsent. Clearly for the first time he had not been completely confident of winning and paid tribute to his young rivals. 'They've been gentlemanly throughout. It's a pleasure to row against people like that. It's been different being the underdogs.' </p> <p>Yet on paper their pedigree was outstanding, with gold medals sprinkled liberally through the crew and power and experience in abundance. But Canada, with just their one title from last year, pushed Britain to the limit. </p> <p>With James Cracknell, Steve Williams and Coode blending sweetly behind Pinsent into one irresistible machine, they put all the injuries, selection problems and politicking of the past eight months behind them and let their awesome power do the talking. There had been doubts about their ability to pull it off because they had managed just eight weeks of uninterrupted training time together in this final line-up. It was, after all, only their fourth race as a crew. </p> <p>For Coode, who came into the crew two months ago when Alex Partridge had to pull out with a collapsed lung, it was the stuff of dreams. Injury to Cracknell brought in supersub Coode for a winning World Cup performance in May, and when Partridge had to drop out he seized his chance. </p> <p>'We were thinking about Alex during the race,' said Coode. 'We felt he was the fifth man in our crew.' </p> <p>World champions Cath Bishop and Katherine Grainger, meanwhile, could not match the mid-race boat speed of Romania's defending Olympic champions, who were determined to avenge their unexpected defeat last year. </p> <p>Bishop and Grainger were fourth at 1500 metres and seemed to falter, but a brilliant final sprint took them past Canada and then Belarus, who had beaten them in the opening heat, to secure a well-deserved silver medal. </p> <p>Sarah Winkless and Elise Laverick raced above themselves to take third place in the double sculls behind New Zealand and Germany; they were closing on both at the line. As the third-priority boat it was an astonishingly confident performance. </p> <p>Today, quadruple scullers Rebecca Romero, Frances Houghton, Debbie Flood and Alison Mowbray will attempt to win a first British women's Olympic rowing title. They will take heart from beating Germany, the Olympic and world champions for all but two of the past 20 years, at Lucerne in June. </p> <p>With \u00a31.76 million per annum pumped into the sport during the past four years through lottery grants, GB rowing is one of the most expensive Olympic sports. But the money has demonstrably had an effect. And the coverage the exploits of Sir Steve Redgrave attracted has ensured rowing punches above its weight. But to maintain the profile requires marketable stars. With Redgrave gone, who can be relied upon to deliver? </p> <p>'I will probably retire,' said Pinsent, 'but my decision will be influenced by what happens on the water. I will not open my big gob and make a snap decision in the overheated atmosphere of the Olympics.' </p> <p>Coach Jurgen Grobler will be seeking to develop a new generation for the Beijing Games and build a men's group around the recovered Partridge, Andrew Hodge and others from the eight. He will also be hoping that Williams, Coode and James Cracknell will want to take up their oars for a further four years, especially if Pinsent hangs up his. And he has a strong young group of eight scullers for the first time in 20 years. </p> <p>But it is the women's squad and coaches Mark Banks, Paul Thompson and Miles Forbes-Thomas who are now providing the best and most consistent results. The athletes are young and ambitious and, with plans in hand to produce an eight for Beijing as well, the media focus may well move to these new stars here in Athens - particularly if the quad wins today.</p> <p> You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Three months ago, his Fleet Street career ended in disaster after he fell victim to a hoax. Now Piers Morgan, the enfant terrible of tabloid newspapers, is set for a high-profile comeback.</p> <p>The former Daily Mirror editor has signed a deal, thought to be worth up to \u00a31.2 million, to write his memoirs. And after a 15-year career at the heart of the red tops, Morgan will have plenty of secrets to spill.</p> <p>The book is expected to detail the highs and lows of a colourful career, during which he has broken scoops ranging from the inside story of Princess Diana's friendship with her butler Paul Burrell, to the revelation that humans could be affected by mad cow disease.</p> <p>Along the way, he certainly made enemies: Cherie Blair is said to have tried to get him sacked, and one of the highlights of the book is likely to be Morgan's account of his dealings with Downing Street.</p> <p>Then there was the test case on privacy law brought by the supermodel Naomi Campbell, who was outraged that he had published photographs of her leaving a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.</p> <p>When she won her case, Morgan reacted with characteristic ebullience, noting that it was 'a very good day for lying, drug-abusing prima donnas who want to have their cake with the media and the right to then shamelessly guzzle it with their Cristal champagne.' Campbell may have good reason to await the book nervously.</p> <p>Yet it was not his skirmishes with celebrities that led to Morgan's sacking last May, but the editorial decision for which he most gained his peers' respect. His decision, in the wake of 11 September to take the Mirror upmarket and cover serious political issues such as the war on Iraq in depth, while his rivals focused on showbiz led indirectly to his downfall.</p> <p>Shortly after horrific photographs of American troops abusing prisoners in Iraq emerged, Morgan obtained similar images of British soldiers apparently beating and urinating on an Iraqi captive. </p> <p>After several days' deliberation, he published them but a lengthy investigation by the Ministry of Defence eventually established that the pictures had not been taken in Iraq, suggesting that they were carefully contrived fakes.</p> <p>Morgan was sacked by Trinity Mirror executives last May.</p> <p>The dismissal halted a Fleet Street career which had begun 15 years ago when he covered showbusiness for the Sun and took him to the helm of the News of the World when he was only 28.</p> <p>He had been at the Mirror for almost nine years when disaster struck.</p> <p>While Morgan said at the time of his sacking that he hoped to take three months off and spend them watching football and cricket - he is a devoted Arsenal fan, and his diary of his club's season, Va Va Voom, is published shortly - few doubted he would eventually bounce back into the public eye.</p> <p>Morgan is understood to have kept meticulous diaries during his newspaper career, which were faithfully stored for him by his mother.</p> <p>The deal for his memoirs, handled by literary agents William Morris, was sealed at a secret auction and the book is expected to be published by Ebury Press next spring.</p> <p>It will not have escaped the mischievous Morgan's attention that this could be smack in the middle of a general election campaign.</p>",
  "A spectre is haunting Northern Ireland. The spectre of memorialism. The ghosts of the Troubles seem to appear around every corner and at every mini-memorial garden in cockpit areas such as north and west Belfast. <p>Of course, in the inverted moral universe of post-Troubles Ulster some dead are more equal than others. The memorials dotted around the Falls, Shankill, Shore and Andersonstown Road are dedicated solely to masked men and women, toting big guns or standing solemnly to attention. The paramilitary fallen have become immortalised in commemorative plaques on the walls near where they were gunned down or captured. And there is hardly a week without some commemoration, large and small, involving middle- to late-aged greying men who gather to remember some dead comrade or other. </p> <p>The exponential growth in memorials and the ceaseless commemorations are perhaps inevitable, maybe even vital to the peace process, in the absence of war. To borrow from Karl Marx again, for the ex-paramilitary sitting twiddling his roll-up commemorations and memorials rather than religion are the ultimate opiates. In short, it keeps them busy and their minds off the utter futility of the last 35 years of struggle. </p> <p>A veritable industry of conflict-nostalgia is booming in places such as west Belfast, where taxis and bus companies charge the curious and the ignorant tourists to see all the hot spots of the Troubles. Indeed, terror-tours appear to be the only arm of Ulster tourism booming in our washed-out summer. Last Wednesday morn ing, for instance, en route along the Falls Road for a funeral at Milltown Cemetery, I noticed a party of European tourists huddled together in the driving rain trying desperately to take some snaps of a new block of republican murals stretching from Northumberland to Dover Street. All along the famous arterial route from central Belfast to the cemetery there were knots of anoraks gawping as the wind and rain lashed the handiwork of the republican mural artists. In Milltown itself, a black taxi took three tourists to the IRA plot where generations of republicans have come to commemorate the Easter Rising or bury comrades, even while all around them loved ones were burying their dead. </p> <p>The nostalgia industry has become such a central element in republican's post-conflict existence that Sinn Fein fights to preserve every historic building or artefact from the Troubles. Last week the party's North Antrim MLA, Philip McGuigan, repeated the demand that the Maze prison be retained as a museum on the lines of Robbin Island where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated. </p> <p>The British Government's preferred option is to use the vast space as the site for a new national sports stadium. The choice is clear: a 40,000 capacity state-of-the-art sports ground housing the Northern Ireland soccer team, Ulster Rugby and maybe the GAA, or even more terror tourism on a grander scale. </p> <p>There is, of course, virtually no space on the walls afforded to that category of the Troubles' dead who vastly outnumber both the paramilitary and state forces - the civilians. Which is where the Turner Prize should come in. Controversialist artists wishing to win the Turner should take heed of this advice: given the absence of civilian victims from the iconography of the Troubles, perhaps it is time for a series of anti-mural murals. These alternative images would follow the same agit-prop style of the republican and loyalist murals but with one sig nificant difference: they should be meta-realistic. That is ,the anti-murals should depict what it is actually like when someone rakes packed bookmakers with gunfire. </p> <p>In this case the painter should show in grim detail the bodies lying across the bookie's floor, the terror in the faces of those still alive, the blood, the gun smoke. Such images should be tinged with a dark sense of irony and incongruity. Bombastic militaristic slogans taken directly from the paramilitary lexicon should be emblazoned above pictures of what the business of killing and maiming entails. </p> <p>You can imagine the furore the anti-mural murals would provoke in certain sections of the community. The realistic and gory portrayal of paramilitary murder gangs carving up their victims in the back of some foul loyalist drinking den, or the effects of a car bomb on human bodies that are charred, shattered and eviscerated would draw criticisms over taste and decency. </p> <p>Is it genuinely the decent thing to shield from what was really done not only the generation that survived the Troubles but, more importantly, the next generation that will be drip-fed a sentimental, sanitised version of events? Is it tasteful to allow the suffering of thousands to be written out of oral, visual and written history? </p> <p>The anti-mural mural project is a challenge to any artist, local or international, to produce work that has the potential to both shock and inform. Whoever takes it up will also be doing this society an important moral and intellectual service.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk\">henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "One of Ian Paisley's closest lieutenants ruled out an early deal between unionists and republicans over devolution yesterday - despite claims in Dublin that the IRA is preparing to put its arms beyond use and shut down its paramilitary units. <p>Democratic Unionist Nigel Dodds said he was doubtful there would be an imminent revival of the power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, which was suspended in October 2002 amid allegations that the IRA was running an intelligence-gathering operation at the heart of government.</p> <p>'It is very difficult to envisage devolution as quickly as Christmas, certainly in terms of it being up and running, because remember it took two years and more to negotiate the previous failed Belfast Agreement,' he told BBC Radio Ulster. </p> <p>The North Belfast MP's comments come amid renewed hopes within the Irish government this weekend that the IRA is readying itself for a major act of decommissioning, combined with a statement that its military machine will be wound down.</p> <p>Bertie Ahern's administration has been told the terror group is prepared to destroy a large tranche of weaponry to boost the prospects of all-party talks next month.</p> <p>'All the intelligence indicates the IRA is up for it,' a seasoned IRA 'watcher' in the Gardai said. 'The base has been prepared for a major shift, including an offer that the organisation will stand down in the event of policing powers being devolved to local political control in Northern Ireland.'</p> <p>Under the rules of the Stormont Assembly, if the DUP and Sinn Fein cut a deal, the republican party would have the second call on a ministry in a reconstituted Northern Ireland government. So, if Paisley's DUP chose the finance portfolio, Sinn Fein would be able to appoint former IRA bomber Gerry Kelly as minister for either policing or justice.</p> <p>Senior Garda officers said Gerry Adams's remark earlier this month that the IRA should be removed to stop unionists using its existence as an excuse not to share power was highly significant.</p> <p>A fortnight ago the IRA leadership dispatched several senior members from Belfast to quell dissent over Adams's comments in South Armagh.</p> <p>Despite disquiet in the border region alongside defections from Sinn Fein in Antrim Town and Tallaght, West Dublin, the Garda officer said the IRA still remained largely united.</p> <p>The DUP has insisted the IRA must go out of existence entirely before policing and justice powers are devolved and unionists share power with republicans.</p> <p>Meanwhile Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble last night called on the DUP chief Ian Paisley to meet him to discuss joint unionist tactics at the talks in September.</p> <p>Trimble said he was not interested in holding talks with a DUP delegation.</p> <p>'I want to speak to the organ grinder and not the monkeys. Ian Paisley still calls the shots and it will be his decisions that will have most significance when the talks get under way,' he added.</p> <p>Paisley has been keeping a low profile in recent weeks after a short spell in hospital. His family and party both insist he will lead the DUP into the talks, first at Stormont on 1 September and then at Leeds Castle, Kent, 15 days later when Tony Blair and Ahern join the negotiations.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Weber </strong> Usher Hall </p> <p><strong>Schubert </strong>Queen's Hall </p> <p><strong>Feldman</strong> Usher Hall</p> <p>Aged only 38, Carl Maria von Weber already knew he was dying when he received an invitation from Charles Kemble to write an opera for Covent Garden. It was 1824, and no fewer than five versions of Weber's huge hit, <strong> Der Freisch\u00fctz</strong>, were playing in London alone. He was, you might say, the Andrew Lloyd Weber of his day. </p> <p>With a wife and two small sons to provide for, Weber defied doctors' orders and accepted the commission. The result was his last opera, <strong> Oberon</strong>, all too rarely performed because Kemble saddled Weber with a stinker of a libretto from his illiterate stage-manager, JR Planch\u00e9. Soon after conducting its premiere in 1826, Weber died in London five months short of his 40th birthday. </p> <p>Between Der Freisch\u00fctz and Oberon, he had written <strong> Euryanthe</strong>, another piece rendered virtually unstageable by its clunky libretto, although Glyndebourne recently made an attempt to prove otherwise. All three mature Weber operas were heard in Edinburgh last week, each in concert performances by different conductors and companies, in commendable defiance of the usual festival penchant for composers with round-figure anniversaries. </p> <p>Equally smart programming, to kick off the series, was an ambitious concert of Weber's orchestral works, to showcase not just the German Romantic's vast range and influence, but the care he brought to thinking about each instrument (including the human voice), while writing music to extend its particular charms. </p> <p>The clarinet and horn being two prime examples, soloists Ronald van Spaendonck and David Pyatt had a whale of a time with the Northern Sinfonia under Thomas Zehetmair working their way through the duets, chamber and orchestral pieces that gave these orchestral Cinderellas rare glimpses of glass slippers. Zehetmair also led his eponymous quartet, with the vivid van Spaendonck, in Weber's <strong> Clarinet Quintet</strong>, before conducting his exuberant first symphony. </p> <p>This six-piece concert was a mere hors d'oeuvre to the operatic blowout that followed over three nights in the Usher Hall, the first course served by Charles Mackerras and his Scottish Chamber Orchestra in the shape of Der Freisch\u00fctz. For once, Festival director Brian McMaster also got the rest of his dream-team casting: Jonas Kaufmann and Hillevi Martinpelto as lovers Max and Agathe, John Relyea and Christopher Maltman as Kaspar and Ottokar, Siegfred Vogel and Ronan Collettas Kuno and Kilian, Ailish Tynan as Annchen. </p> <p>For my money, this plot is quite as absurd as the others, with its reliance on magic bullets and other such gothic-horror gizmos. Only the hirsute Kaufmann, sporting a wildman look as outlandish as his role, hurled himself into the evening with the requisite abandon: Relyea was too concerned to be charming, Martinpelto too unsure of her command in the top register. The show was stolen by Mackerras and his marvellous players, who squeezed every stave of drama from Weber's luridly romantic score. </p> <p>No wonder Kemble wanted Weber to lay on mermaids, pirates, fairies, magical scene-shifts and all other conceivable ways of filling the Covent Garden stage with crowd-pulling phantasmagoria. It all remained in the Edinburgh mind's eye as Barry Banks's stalwart Oberon and Anna Burford 's sultry Puck (otherwise unconnected with Shakespeare) masterminded the storm-tossed romance of Peter Bronder's stolid Sir Huon and Elizabeth Whitehouse's stately Reiza. With the dashing Garry Magee wasted as Sherasmin, the evening again belonged to Richard Armstrong's Scottish Opera orchestra and its doomed chorus. </p> <p>As for Euryanthe... perhaps it was Weber fatigue, but this last and longest of the three evenings proved far the toughest endurance test, as the piece's longueurs were ill-disguised by the American conductor David Robertson, for all the efforts of the BBC Scottish Symphony and competent, if uninspired soloists in Neal Davies (Lysiart), Stewart Skelton (Adolar), Alfred Reiter (King Ludwig), Christine Brewer (Eglantine) and Gabriele Fontana in the title role. </p> <p>It was a close call between academic interest and musical pleasure throughout this Weber marathon, a rare chance to hear the development of his attempts to drag German singspiel into the 19th century. Performing these last three operas in chronological order might have made more sense. </p> <p>Highlight of the morning concerts in the Queen's Hall was the first in a series of <strong> Schubert</strong> recitals by the Georgian pianist Elisabeth Leonskaja, who brought a tender touch and demonic energy to an ambitious programme boasting the Wanderer fantasy between the sonatas in B flat and A, D664. If at times heavy-handed, especially in the bravura sections, and prone to deconstructing slower passages to the point of standstill, Leonskaja conjured some touching lyrical moments while taking an almost worryingly brave approach to those all-important Schubertian silences. </p> <p>All the more galling that her filigree detail in the Wanderer should have been ruined by a mobile phone; shooting, as one audience member observed, is far too good for these miscreants. </p> <p>Finally, believe it or not, your critic found a tear in his eye during some contemporary music. This career first, brought on by the exquisite viola playing of Lawrence Power and percussion work of Heather Corbett, came during Rothko Chapel , <strong> Morton Feldman</strong>'s poignant elegy forpainter Mark Rothko. </p> <p>This haunting 25-minute piece launched a late-night programme in which David Goode's 20-minute rendition of Feldman's organ work Principal Sound left me quite unmoved. But the lachrymose plaints of Power's viola linger still.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Heckle and chide</strong></p> <p>Distressing news of a convocation of dissolute comedians who have formed the Heckle Club. The stand-ups fall down drinking until 9am, then scan the Fringe brochure for an early morning show to disrupt with obscene and raucous heckling. Unfortunately, shows at that time tend to be for kids and there have been ugly incidents resulting in tears on the stage and brutal ejections from the auditorium. Other comedians have been warned. </p> <p><strong>Bleating Bach</strong></p> <p> Two eccentric musical comedians, one playing Bach, the other Victor Borge, are both extracting comic mileage out of the strange whimpering sounds you can hear on the piano recordings of the late, great Glenn Gould. In Bach for Kids at the Greenside, Geoffrey Thomas tells how he heard Gould play on his father's old records and thought it was background static. Rainer Hersch, at the Assembly Rooms in Borge Again, celebrates Gould's 'stupid cat sounds' before playing the 'Blue Danube Waltz' upside down and establishing a link between Mozart and Abba. Favourite Borge gag? Man stops Borge in the street and asks him: 'Was it you or your brother who died?' </p> <p><strong>Borge Again</strong></p> <p> Borge Again is directed by Guy Masterson, back in town after his departure from directing One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and to perform in his own adaptation of Animal Farm. 'Don't read anything you believe in the newspapers,' he says, though he seems not to deny he was muscled off the job by the star power of Christian Slater and Frances Barber. Chatting in the Assembly star bar, we were stormed by comics from his production last year of Twelve Angry Men, and The Office's Mackenzie Crook, who all tell him of next year's plan for a stage version of The Great Escape, with Guy directing. You read that here first. </p> <p><strong>The star is porn</strong></p> <p> Privacy issues raised by Tim Fountain's Gaydar show pop up again in Dirty Fan Male at the Gilded Balloon, where the sad letters written by male clients to soft porn stars are performed brilliantly in a range of styles (Noel Coward to Michael Caine) by Duncan Wisbey. The letters are funny, but only at the expense of their writers, though all names have been changed. Dirty Fan Male is directed by one Alan Cox. </p> <p><strong>The Master</strong></p> <p> When Sir Brian McMaster completes his final year as director of the International Festival in 2006, he will have become the longest-serving artistic director in its history. His 15 years will take him way beyond the record tenure of Peter Diamond. And is Guardian critic Michael Billington putting down a marker to succeed him? At an informal critics' lunch, McMaster revealed that he was in search of a role in a British classic next year for the great German diva Jutta Lampe, last week's Andromache, and took seriously Billington's suggestion: Hester Collyer in Terence Rattigan's The Deep Blue Sea, with Katie Mitchell as director.</p>",
  "<p>As I walk up Broughton Street, the mecca of soya cafe lattes, everyone is knee-deep in newspapers. The headlines scream 'Assassin City', but, unlike Basra, it is still illegal (so far as I know) to shoot a performer deemed below par. Instead, the reviews rely on carefully crafted words to police performers behaving badly, if indeed they are (carefully crafted I mean). </p> <p>But, hey, this is Edinburgh, the only Festival in the world where the public can gorge themselves on several shows a day in adjacent venues, ie a theatre, a curry house and a Land-Rover complete with sheep noises (don't ask). Meanwhile, the performers nestle side-by-side on a campus where they can self-refer, bond or other. So no pressure then. </p> <p>The subject of reviews rears its head whether you like it or not, since, by now, people are stapling to performers the words 'genius', 'a star in the making' or 'Woody Allen-esque' to double-confirm to the world that it has all been worth it and that they are not what everyone fears - a loser. </p> <p>My attitude to reviews remains paranoid yet strangely reliable. I am able to deduce from tone of voice if the content of a review is good or bad, even if the speaker is referring to the weather ('Very rainy, have lost two umbrellas so far'). </p> <p>By interpreting some key tonal downward inflections, I worked out that all was not going entirely well in the first week for me. Feeling sick, I called my friend John Hegley for crisis intervention. He fixes a quiet pub and repeats the mantra - never ever, ever read your own reviews. </p> <p>That night in our (very shared) undressing space in the Assembly Rooms, I'm doing bending-down movements to emit the negative auras (and any residual performer's wind). Adam Smith strolls by, alerted to sudden whooshing sounds. I mention my despair at reviews as I shake out the demons. He says: 'But I read a good one of you.' What? Good? Could you say the G word again please? In an instant, Adam has flicked the switch. </p> <p>At my launch party, I effusively greet a man in a grey suit, assuming him to be a TV producer (everyone else is in khaki casual). He extricates himself from my embrace, saying he's just come in 'to do the till rolls in the kitchen next door, if I don't mind'. I don't. Not really. Then the cast of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest troops in. Would they like a cocktail? Sadly no; they are merely passing through - to get on stage for their 'dress run'. Possibly something to do with chicken pox. </p> <p>Later, I watch Jim Sweeney's show about having MS and find myself crying; it's deep, funny and with no trace of self-pity. I see Mike McShane as we shuffle out. I have got to know him well since we both undress at the same time. (He is holder of the five-star accolade: respect.) Mike is on before me, so I hear his huge laughs as I go into bending- down mode. I ask him to tell Jim: 'Helen Lederer said hello.' I can't believe I've done this; couldn't I say: 'Wow, awesome fantastic' in person? </p> <p>My co-actresses Nicola and Miranda make me write down positive things. This is useful, even if it is a check list of all the food I need to pack every night for cooking on stage. If I see another melon, I'll weep. </p> <p>The bar is now hopping with men and some women who could make or break careers. I ask someone to staple a sign on our posters saying that we have sold out and are having to do extra shows 'by popular demand' even if the words 'genius' and 'Woody Allen-esque' are missing. I am grateful that Edinburgh has allowed me to do a flawed show, which is the beginning of a journey. What else? No one has died and it is still raining.</p>",
  "Readers of this column are likely to be in white-collar jobs and for some time, the way most of us do such jobs has been subtly changing. The demands on the white-collar world to be more productive may have been rising, but we are asking for more latitude in how and when we deliver and increasingly we expect our requests to be met. <p>An ICM poll for the Guardian last week delivered the startling result that 61 per cent of respondents thought they spent too much time at work and wanted more flexibility over hours; that 70 per cent were familiar with the government's policies that allow employees to request flexible working hours and, in particular, up to six months' additional unpaid maternity and two weeks' paternity leave. And they want more. </p> <p>Here, New Labour, persuaded reluctantly by its senior women politicians, notably Patricia Hewitt, has stumbled on a vote-winner despite concerns that its initiatives might upset the god Business. Who controls time at work has always been at the heart of the tension between employer and employee; it was the demand for an eight-hour day and 40-hour week that animated the foundations of early trade unionism. </p> <p>The privilege of the liberal professions was and is that their practitioners have sovereignty over how they spend their day. They can come in late, work or not over lunch, take work home and leave early, all within a framework of meeting workloads they themselves can shape. </p> <p>The arrival of modern communications (this is being typed on my laptop at home at 7am on Saturday morning to be emailed to The Observer later) now extends the same privilege to a new cohort of white-collar workers - journalists, consultants, advertising executives, financial controllers, publishers - who can write their reports, rework their figures or whatever away from the office. </p> <p>And they are taking the opportunity, exploiting the flexibility to do other things with this time: eating with their children at meal times; keeping an otherwise impossible doctor's appointment; being at home when builders and repairmen call. As the ICM poll revealed, this is how the majority now want to organise their lives, going to the office only when they need to and not when they don't. </p> <p>Nor should we be surprised that blue-collar workers want to join in or that, when they can't, if they are sufficiently disaffected, they will take time off anyway - the infamous 'sickie'. The revelation last week that BA baggage handlers take as many as 17 days off sick a year and that BA was prepared to offer \u00a31,000 over two years if the numbers were halved, as part of its offer to avert a damaging strike at Heathrow over the August bank holiday, led to a collective national tut-tutting. </p> <p>Not only were the baggage handlers holding the airline to ransom over the busiest weekend of the year, threatening to inflict considerable inconvenience on innocent passengers and damaging the airline's reputation at a crucial moment in its fortunes but they were a bunch of skivers to boot. The privilege of having some autonomy over one's time should not be extended to the working classes. </p> <p>The BA offer, even though it will have been modified in negotiation with the unions, is an important moment. It follows Tesco's deal negotiated earlier this year with the union USDAW, within the framework of its partnership agreement, to offer additional holiday and benefits to staff who have exemplary attendance records. </p> <p>But while Tesco was essentially doing no more than modernising the long- standing idea of an attendance bonus, BA crossed a Rubicon For the presumption behind its offer was that workers claiming illness as an excuse for absence were probably lying and that, in consequence, a fundamental employee entitlement - the right to paid sick leave - should be bought out. It was a precedent-setting move. </p> <p>In fairness, BA probably calculated that the union could never accept the offer, but that it was worth making to open another negotiating flank - and that the revelation would put the union and baggage handlers on the defensive in the wider argument to win public support. It was right. In the public-relations battle, BA won hands down; the story became the baggage-handlers' appetite for sick leave. </p> <p>However, the two sides ultimately settled the issue - my hunch is that the offer will be transmuted into some form of an unobjectionable attendance bonus as part of a long-term pay deal that gives the lion's share of what the unions want - it has exposed unhappy double standards. </p> <p>The affair was not publicly understood in terms of how workers and their managers might organise the contemporary workplace, even in a task like baggage handling, so that low-paid, unskilled workers can have a modicum of the control over their working lives enjoyed by white-collar workers, thus reducing the need to take sickies. Rather, it was portrayed as a moment when a cornered, honest company made a bold move to end what too many of us privately agree is a national inclination - to lie about being ill. </p> <p>Yet the CBI says that only 15 per cent of short-term sickness absences are false. If the numbers are rising, then managements should address the fundamental causes rather than try to end or qualify the entitlement to paid sick leave, still honestly claimed by the vast majority. </p> <p>Employers need to recognise that the demand to want flexibility is not some faddish ruse dreamt up by New Labour, but a fundamental shift in collective attitudes that are shared across the board. If workplaces are not organised to permit some flexibility, employees will tend to take matters into their own hands, the more so if their work is dreary, demanding, poorly paid and managed by men and women who make no attempt to engage or inspire them because they themselves are disengaged and uninspired. </p> <p>There is some evidence that a growing number of employers recognise this. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development says that the commonest response to growing absences is a one-on-one interview with the individual concerned rather than punitive attempts to buy out collective sickness entitlements, a conclusion that our research at the Work Foundation supports.</p> <p>Yet the reflex response to the request for flexibility in too many workplaces remains one of suspicion; one nameless investment bank uses it to separate 'winners' from 'losers'.</p> <p>Britain's fundamental economic structures are changing; industries and services built around knowledge are growing, while those built around mass industrial production and raw muscle power are declining.</p> <p>Work is becoming more intelligent, and an intelligent workforce is going to be one that wants to be intelligent about how it organises itself. The more autonomy and control it can have, the more content it will be.</p> <p>New Labour is reaping some unexpected benefits from pioneering in this territory; it should go further. Employers and unions alike have no choice but to follow.</p>",
  "<p>For the negotiators who spent hour upon hour in fraught and dramatic talks at British Airway's Heathrow headquarters last week, the stakes could hardly have been higher. </p> <p>With less than a week to go before the strike action called by unions over pay was set to hit bank holiday travellers, airline bosses were under no illusions as to the importance of a deal. But they also knew they could not give in to union demands for an above inflation pay deal without anything in return. </p> <p>Led by chief executive Rod Eddington, BA is stretched to the point where it can't afford avoidable financial knocks. It cannot afford strikes financially or reputationally. But neither can it afford to be generous without recouping money through efficiency gains. </p> <p>So when, on Tuesday, BA revised the offer that had triggered the GMB and T&amp;G ballots it attached 'productivity' strings. It offered some 8.5 per cent over three years - comprising 2.5 per cent in year one and inflation thereafter - backdated to October plus a \u00a31,000 lump sum payable in three instalments to those taking less than 16 days off sick in a two-year period. It met union demands for 14.5 per cent over three years. </p> <p>Unions reacted coldly, saying they would not accept pay linked to absence. Hopes of a deal fluctuated wildly. According to Ed Blissett, chief negotiator for the GMB union: 'It has been extremely difficult to call all week. If you had asked me on Tuesday morning, I would have said there was a good chance of a deal. A day later, I would have said that had gone. On Thursday we had discussions and things were very hopeful.' The unions' optimism of an easy breakthrough was misplaced. On Thursday Blissett and the T&amp;G's Brendan Gold indicated agreement was close and that all that was needed was the productivity strings cut or substantially loosened. </p> <p>But a BA spokesman said: 'The unions were suggesting that a deal was close because the money was on the table, they just needed to negotiate away the productivity elements. They do not realise that that was central to the deal.' </p> <p>By Friday, the absence question had been separated from the pay deal, but BA was determined it would be included in a parallel agreement. The company says the reason is simple: its costs are rising by more than inflation. This month it warned that high oil prices would drive fuel, its second-highest single cost at \u00a31 billion a year, up by \u00a3225 million. </p> <p>Last week, operations director Mike Street said, pensions payments had pushed up the wage bill - the number one cost - by 9 per cent. Analysts calculate that pensions alone are adding \u00a3100m a year to the company's \u00a32.2bn wage bill. Add the impact on yields of competition from low-cost airlines and the problem for BA is acute, says Chris Avery of JP Morgan. </p> <p>'This is very very high stakes stuff,' he added. 'Last year you had \u00a3405m of earnings before interest and tax. If you have \u00a3100m extra on pensions and \u00a3225m on fuel, that is 75 per cent of that swallowed up by above inflation costs. So it is vital that they get an inflation-plus productivity deal on pay. But there is a long-term industrial relations problem in the industry because unit revenues are falling over time.' </p> <p>Last week's frenzied activity gives a glimpse of the constant friction between company and unions. At the beginning of the week, BA already faced a strike by some 3,000 GMB workers who had voted for one the week before. Then, while the talks were in progress, 8,000 check-in staff and baggage handlers belonging to the T&amp;G also voted to strike. </p> <p>BA's priority was to get the threat of bank holiday strikes lifted, but the marathon talks were also an attempt to play for time. The company was also maintaining its insistence that any deal must pay for itself through productivity improvements. </p> <p>The bank holiday represents the final rush of the summer. Last year's 'swipe card' strikes, which cost BA \u00a340m, hit at the end of July, the middle of the summer holiday season. Without a repetition of last year's wildcat action, this weekend's strike would have cost an estimated \u00a310m, a minimal sum compared with the company's \u00a32.2bn wage bill. </p> <p>But the risk was also to its reputation. Pictures of thousands of passengers spending the night in terminals would have done untold damage to BA's image as a leading airline and international services company.</p> <p>By pushing any potential action into September, BA would reduce the impact. Its traffic statistics show that passenger numbers fell by nearly 100,000 between August and September 2002, and nearly 200,000 last year. Meanwhile, revenues also drop sharply, reflecting changes in pricing as the holiday season ends.</p> <p>Street put public pressure on the unions to put the strikes off, urging them to ballot on the deal. They recognised the ploy. </p> <p>'It has been very important for them to play for time,' says one GMB official. 'First of all, they tried to get us into binding arbitration, which would have taken time and pushed it into September. Then they made the offer. They knew it would take three weeks to reballot our members. That is why they made it when they did.' On Friday the stakes were increased again as BA stopped taking bookings over the bank holiday weekend. </p> <p>Meanwhile, BA used the new offer to whittle away support for the strike among members. The unions will have been nervous. A 14.5 per cent with productivity deal was at the centre of last autumn's negotiations between Royal Mail and the Communication Workers Union. Chairman Allan Leighton talked about the need for productivity gains as vital to the company's survival and was roundly attacked by the union. The dispute ended in fiasco when CWU members voted against strike action. </p> <p>T&amp;G officials angrily rebutted suggestions that the offer undermined their result because it changed the terms on offer. The GMB maintained it had a clear mandate. </p> <p>But a BA spokesman said: The GMB ballot was a low turn-out, with a low majority [53 per cent] on an old deal.' That, they say, is not much of a mandate. They will have taken a similar view on the T&amp;G ballot. Although the baggage handlers voted to strike with a much higher majority, the new lump sum deal may have whittled that away. </p> <p>BA's calculation infuriated the unions. They claim that BA launched its offer on Tuesday over the heads of their officials - a tactic used by Royal Mail heads Leighton and Adam Crozier during last year's dispute. </p> <p>The T&amp;G's Gold said: 'The meeting between us and BA on Tuesday was very acrimonious because they had put this offer to members before they put it to us. We had complaints from members about that, and we got nowhere with BA. It soured the atmosphere.' </p> <p>Unions claims high-pressure tactics have also been used. One official says: 'When they got the GMB result [on 13 August], David Lebrecht, head of human resources, said that if there was going to be a strike they would shut the airline down and send everybody home. Effectively a lock-out. That would allow people to change their travel arrangements and avoid some of the PR problems they faced last year.' </p> <p>But unions admit to the rivalries among themselves - along with the GMB and T&amp;G there is Amicus, representing engineers, which has not balloted - and their members. One GMB official said: 'Baggage handlers are much more likely to accept unpensionable lump sums [such as the \u00a31000 payment] than check-in staff because they have better pension arrangements. I think their strategy was to get the T&amp;G baggage handlers [about 4,000 of the total] to accept the new offer, put pressure on their check-in staff, and agree to the deal.' </p> <p>The legacy of these talks is that relations are sure to remain tense. As one analyst said: 'The tensions are simply built in to this. BA cannot afford to pay more than inflation. The unions believe their staff are badly underpaid. This means the only way they can achieve anything above a real-terms standstill is to go into battle for it. These are not ideal conditions for harmonious industrial relations, and we should all expect more grief to come in future.'</p>",
  "<p>More than 10,000 British Airways staff will be balloted by their unions this week over a last-ditch pay deal that has lifted the threat of bank holiday travel chaos at Heathrow. </p> <p>Leaders of the Transport and General Workers union and the GMB will recommend acceptance of the deal hammered out in the early hours of yesterday morning, which led to the unions calling off threatened strike action by 11,000 check-in and baggage handling staff. </p> <p>The deal, reached after a marathon 17 hours of talks through Friday and into yesterday, gives the union an 8.5 per cent increase in pay over three years plus \u00a31,000 payable in three lump sums up to September 2006. </p> <p>BA agreed to the pay deal only after unions had accepted a new policy on absence from work, introducing disciplinary procedures for persistent absenteeism. The airline wants to reduce the average 17 days sickness leave per employee taken each year to 10 days, saving some \u00a330 million from the current \u00a370m the absenteeism costs. The new policy covers all staff except cabin crew. </p> <p>It was last-minute talks with cabin crew on this issue that BA claims pushed negotiations into yesterday morning, after agreement with check-in and baggage handling staff had been reached at around 5pm on Friday. </p> <p>The new absence policy covers all staff groups across BA except cabin crew, who had not been balloted for bank holiday strike action as their pay talks were separate. They have not so far agreed to the terms, but negotiations will resume along with pay talks later this year. </p> <p>Ballot papers will be sent to T&amp;G and GMB BA members this week and a result is expected within 10 days. </p> <p>Brendan Gold, chief negotiator for the T&amp;G, said he expected his membership would accept the deal. 'It will go to the shop stewards this week and then to the membership. We would not be recommending this if we did not think it was a good deal, and I sincerely hope the membership accepts it. </p> <p>'This has been an extremely tough negotiation, and I am very pleased that we have got a result that I think the membership can support.' </p> <p>A GMB spokesman took a more cautious view: 'This is positive because it has avoided strike action, but there is some way to go before we achieve a full resolution to all the questions that have been raised through a ballot.' He said the GMB ballot would run on a similar timescale to the T&amp;G's. </p> <p>A BA spokesman said there was relief at the airline's Waterside headquarters near Heathrow when the deal was signed. He said the implementation of the sickness policy across all staff groups would lead to pay agreements being self-financing, but he accepted that there were still tough negotiations ahead with cabin crew. </p> <p>Mike Street, BA's customer service and operations director, said: 'The agreed policy of absence is tough on those persistent absentees while remaining compassionate towards the genuinely sick.' </p> <p>Gold and the GMB's lead negotiator, Ed Blissett, were locked in talks from 9am on Friday to nearly 2am yesterday. Hopes of a deal had ebbed and flowed throughout the week. BA made it clear that it could not afford a deal without a link to reducing absenteeism, adding that a strike would cost \u00a310m a day. On Friday it increased the pressure on the unions by refusing further bank holiday bookings. </p> <p>BA initially offered an extra \u00a31,000 to staff in a revised proposal last Tuesday. But that sum was only payable to those who were absent on fewer than 16 days over two years. The unions refused to accept this, and this disagreement led to three full days of talks ending in Friday's marathon session.</p>",
  "<p>Hand on heart, I can't say I'm one of those people who have always wanted to be in a musical. I'm pretty sure I've never even seen one, except at the cinema when I was about six. And does Zulu count? Anyway, I have been handpicked by The Observer as the man with the least dignity to lose from guesting with the chorus on the sound track for Bat Boy, which was a big hit in New York and, more recently, Leeds. Who knows? I might get discovered. What if Kevin Spacey or Gwynnie happen to be in the studio and ask if by chance I have written any novels that might make a good film? </p> <p>I turn up on the day with two random tunes dancing woodenly in my head from the material sent by the PR. I meet the composer, Laurence 'Larry' O'Keefe, who is in the control room directing the goings-on in the studio opposite, where the cast are currently roaring their way through a breezy number full of intimidating harmonies. Larry immediately puts me at my ease by asking if I'd like to join them. I wouldn't. I would like to run. </p> <p>'It'll be fine,' he says. 'We're just about to do the animal scene.' </p> <p>The animal scene? </p> <p>'Yes; what's your favourite animal noise? You know, the one animal you've always wanted to imitate?' </p> <p>My mind is a blank. I've got four children - why would I need to do my own animal noises? I rack my brains. I can't even name an animal. 'Er, cow,' I say eventually. 'Great!' Larry says. 'Cows are fine,' says someone else. 'We love cows. A cow is good.' </p> <p>'Or how about buffalo?' I venture, getting the hang of this. Hey, that's even better, everyone agrees. Hurray! </p> <p>I'm delirious of course. There's no way I can do a buffalo. Never mind - cows are still good! I could never have gone into theatre. It's not the talent, it's the enthusiasm. Though obviously it's the talent, too. As it turns out, my cow deserts me the minute I step into the studio to be introduced to all the proper singers. Instead, after much agonising, I opt for a mosquito that turns unaccountably into a wasp halfway through. And a dog for the sex scene. Yes, the animal sex scene. Bat Boy is fun for all the family - even teenagers. My dog is actually rather good. He's a small dog but gives a spunky account of himself, with a creditable yap at the climax. </p> <p>Next up is a gospel number, which I now distinctly remember not listening to properly at home. No worries. Larry, seated at his piano, runs through the chorus with me while the preacher comes bellowing in and out with stuff about Jesus and sinners (never in my life have I stood so near to someone singing so loud). OK, I've got the tune in my head, except the tricky fiddly bit. My big fear is buggering it up and everyone hating me for us having to do it all again. I'm not wholly familiar with the script but, spookily, Bat Boy is precisely about a tragic misfit who enters a closed community and is set upon by villagers with pitchforks for not knowing the words to the songs. Well, that and eating the livestock. </p> <p>Headphones on and off we go. 'Make a joyful noise my sooooo-oul,' I trill. Luckily, I can barely hear myself, what with everyone to my rear whooping it up with such gusto as to send a chap's shirt-tails flapping. </p> <p>Hmm. Larry, now safely behind the control desk, is wondering who is ever so slightly flat. And is someone getting just a little ahead of the beat? Amazingly, neither offence is traced to me, though it seems just a matter of time before proceedings are halted to identify the person who is moving his lips with no sound coming out. Still, once more from the top. And again. And again. 'Let some of the consonants do the work for you,' shouts Larry. </p> <p>We take five. Isn't it lovely how theatre people lie around between songs stroking each other? Having no one to stroke, I inspect my score and vow to do something about my consonants. My throat is paying for all that unaccustomed barking. </p> <p>It's the last song and Larry and I get together at the piano - in much the same way I imagine old Rodgers and Hammerstein used to do back in the days of, um, Annie Get Your Gun - to work out where I'm likely to come unstuck. I'm not sure whether to choose the higher octave or lower, both being so comfortably out of my range. </p> <p>But it happens in the end. Larry's inordinate demands for ahh-ing during the finale drain the oxygen from my lungs, but we do get there. And it's a wrap. Or whatever they say round here. I have done so well that Bat Boy himself asks if I'd like to try on his ears. Perhaps he senses a kindred spirit. Or maybe he's just angling for a spot in my film. </p> <p> <strong> \u00b7 </strong> Bat Boy is previewing now and opens on 8 September, Shaftesbury Theatre, London WC2</p>",
  "They are the photographs that show what is perhaps the greatest story of endurance and valour ever told, the epic narrative of Ernest Shackleton's near-fatal Antarctic expedition of 1914. <p>The explorer's desperate bid to save the lives of his crew has been hailed as the epitome of human achievement against the odds, while the arresting images captured by Frank Hurley's camera have ensured that the historic events have kept an icy grip on public imagination. </p> <p>But now it has emerged that the iconic photographs, among the most valuable ever taken, are not all they seem. New evidence and testimony from a surviving eyewitness reveal that Hurley, the pioneering Australian cameraman and adventurer, fabricated scenes and doctored images. </p> <p>The poignant photographs recording Shackleton's departure from Elephant Island and the return of his rescue party in 1916 are both misrepresentations of what actually happened. Hurley's frequent use of 'artistic licence' was confirmed this weekend by the last remaining survivor of an Antarctic mission that was officially photographed and filmed by Hurley. </p> <p>Australian Alf Howard, 98, was a young chemist in 1929 when he won a crew place on Robert Falcon Scott's former vessel, Discovery, which was to be taken back to Antarctica by Douglas Mawson. </p> <p>'I was told there was an expedition that needed a chemist to look into the properties of sea water, so I jumped at the chance,' said Howard, speaking from his home in Melbourne last week. </p> <p>Until that point he knew little about Antarctica and had not heard of Hurley, who was already revered by photographers for his work on Mawson's 1911 voyage and Shackleton's ill-fated Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. </p> <p>'We were finding new things every day, and discovering new lands,' said Howard, remembering the trip that gave him a lifelong love of Antarctica. He also struck up a firm friendship with Hurley, whose darkroom door opened into his own laboratory on Discovery. 'Frank was very easy company,' said Howard. 'He was older than me, but a comedian, always up to some sort of trick. He was the life of the party.' </p> <p>Howard recalls an occasion at the wardroom table when smoke started to come out of one crew member's ears. It turned out to be an illusion set up by Hurley with the aid of a cigarette and a piece of rubber tubing. It was a playful attitude that extended into Hurley's work, Howard says in a BBC documentary to be screened tomorrow. 'He would not go against the truth, but he would do anything to highlight a particular point,' said Howard this weekend. 'He would modify the background to a picture. He had a very good idea of what the thing would look like.' </p> <p>The well-known image of Shackleton's departing open boat is one of those later embellished in the dark room by the addition of a brooding cloudscape, according to the team behind the documentary. The picture is a key element in the detail of a heroic rescue mission. After 326 days trapped in the ice, Endurance was crushed in the melting spring ice. The 28-man crew lived for five months on the ice, then made a perilous seven-day journey to the nearest land mass, where they were left by Shackleton and two others, who went for help. </p> <p>The picture of Shackleton's crew, marooned on Elephant Island, joyfully greeting their returning leader is also a piece of historical fakery. It was, in fact, a picture taken at the time of Shackleton's departure. Howard admits Hurley was 'very good at manipulating' images, but he says there was always a good reason. 'He would superimpose images, but I don't think he ever tried to alter the outcome.' </p> <p>Howard believes the fakery is often there for the trained eye to spot. 'If you're looking for it, you can tell whenever there's not a complete continuation in the background. If he's got two or three birds in together and then another bird which is offset from that, I'll look for where there's a break in the background. </p> <p>'The same thing applied to his war photography later. If he could get two bunkers into a picture and make a more realistic picture, well, OK.' </p> <p>Hurley was also prepared to stage reconstructions if an incident was too quick for his lens. Once, Howard remembers, an albatross was caught and brought on board Discovery. It pecked Howard and Hurley restaged the event, making a tear in Howard's shorts to add a little comedy. </p> <p>The pressure was on Hurley to make money for the expedition from photographs and films. The words, 'Near enough is not good enough,' were scratched into the wood over his dark room and he took great physical risks to get a dramatic shot. </p> <p>Howard remembers Hurley going anywhere on the ship in search of the right image. He would even climb to the end of the yardarm. 'One of his main things was to go off to the crow's nest and then take a rod above that and stick it up above the crow's nest and then put the camera on that,' said Howard. 'Then he'd be able to photograph the whole of the ship from above.' </p> <p>Howard took Hurley's place providing the live voiceover to public screenings of the footage from Antarctica in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. By the end of the run, auditoriums were packed. For Howard this was testament to Hurley's skill. He may have sometimes used trickery, but he was always there to watch events unfold: 'He always had a camera with him as he moved around the deck, looking for opportunities to take something.' </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> BBC Four, tomorrow, 9pm.

  "Travellers know they are approaching Wittenoom from the health warnings posted every few miles along the roadside. By law, tourist maps must warn you away from the town before you reach it. When you arrive, the signs advise you to keep doors and windows closed, <p>Around 161,000 tonnes of blue asbestos was mined from Wittenoom by 7,000 mostly immigrant labourers before the mine closed in 1966. </p> <p>The mineral, also known as crocidolite, is the most fatal variety of asbestos, and Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council estimates that the final death toll among mine workers operation will rise to 2,000, on a par with Bhopal and Chernobyl in the first rank of industrial disasters. </p> <p>Even so, the 15 remaining residents are determined to stay despite attempts by the government to cut off their electricity, water and telephone lines. 'We've got no intention of moving,' says Lorraine Thomas, the town's councillor and proprietor of its only shop. </p> <p>The West Australian government has plans to shut down the town entirely, closing its approach roads, demolishing the 25 remaining buildings, and even renaming roads carrying its name. In May buildings at the abandoned mine were finally demolished. </p> <p>But Thomas is sceptical of claims about the health effects of crocidolite, despite the recent deaths of two neighbours from mesothelioma, a virulent cancer caused by asbestos exposure. She says that testing of airborne particles in the town have shown that levels of asbestos fibre are no worse than in most urban areas in Australia. </p> <p>The problems that began at Wittenoom have spread around Australia, leaving the country with the world's worst asbestos disease problem. With a third of the UK's population, its annual asbestos disease fatalities of more than 3,000 people match Britain's death-for-death. </p> <p>In the optimistic atmosphere of postwar Australia, asbestos seemed to make a lot of sense. The country is dotted with deposits of the mineral, from the crocidolite seams of Wittenoom to the white asbestos lode of Woodsreef in New South Wales, where 500,000 tonnes of chrysotile was mined before the plant closed in 1983. </p> <p>A hot, dry country whose postwar motto was 'Populate or perish' saw the insulating fibre as the perfect material to build the millions of cheap, cool homes needed to house a population projected to quadruple by 1973. One in three houses built in Australia before 1982 contains asbestos, and local slang even has its own word for it, 'fibro'. </p> <p>The workers allotted to mine the asbestos were mostly southern Europeans. Ivan Ivandich was a 19-year-old Yugoslav refugee in Italy when he signed a two-year work contract to emigrate to the young country. He had little idea that he would end up processing asbestos dust in the 40C heat of Western Australia's far north. </p> <p>'In the first job, I had to go in the mills filling the bags. The dust meant you couldn't see five metres in front of you. They give us gas masks, but after a hour the filter was full. I said, Jesus, I don't think any prisoners in the world have been treated like this.' </p> <p>He was not the only one alarmed at conditions. Since the late 1940s government health inspectors had warned about the dangers of asbestos diseases at the site, but little had been done by the owners, CSR, to improve conditions. </p> <p>The mills were poorly ventilated and used second-hand equipment, while workers slept in barrack dormitories and ate in communal tents. For Christmas, their bosses gave them a bottle of beer. </p> <p>Since the late 1980s CSR has paid out millions of dollars to the victims of the Wittenoom mine, following a court ruling that the company had acted with a reckless disregard for its employees' safety. </p> <p>Since 1989 it has settled more than 1,400 claims in Australia and has a further 600 pending, and has established a A$324m (\u00a3125m) fund to pay for these cases and a further 130,000 in America, to where many of its fibre-board products were exported. </p> <p>Ella Sweeney, treasurer of the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia, points out that the tragedy of Wittenoom dwindles into insignificance beside the effects of asbestos manufacturing. Across Australia, 45,000 people are expected to die from asbestos-related cancers before the epidemic peaks in 2020. </p> <p>For four years in the mid-1970s she worked at a Sydney hospital where she says several co-workers have developed asbestos-related diseases: 'They did a lot of reno- vations. They took the roof off the maternity unit, put another floor on and put the roof back on. </p> <p>Most staff tried to find the quickest way from A to B, so we'd go through that bit of the building. I would go back to the office with white dust in my hair and didn't think anything of it.' </p> <p>Two decades after it became obsolete in the building trade, asbestos was only finally outlawed in Australia this year and the money now is not in producing it, but in getting rid of it. McMahon, the Adelaide company that led the clean-up of Wittenoom, has made A$100m in the past 15 years from decommissioning contaminated sites. </p> <p>For Wittenoom's remaining residents, that nationwide public health problem means there is little incentive to leave. 'I made a decision based on the facts that as far as living here, there's a risk to everyone in Australia,' says Thomas. 'There's a greater risk in Perth than here.'</p>",
  "Upper Bann MP David Trimble called last night for special police patrols to protect Portuguese and other immigrant workers from racist attacks in his constituency. <p>Two Portuguese families were forced to leave their homes in Portadown early yesterday after their doors had been kicked and battered.</p> <p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland moved the families from three apartments in Moeran Park around 1.30am. Police officers arranged for temporary accommodation for a Portuguese couple and their two children, aged four and six, who were living in one of the apartments. The brother-in-law and two sisters of the couple were also moved.</p> <p>A PSNI spokesman yesterday appealed for anyone who had spotted suspicious activity in the Moeran Park estate to come forward. The PSNI believe that up to three people were involved in the attack.</p> <p>Commenting on the attacks, Trimble, the local MP, said: 'One is appalled about these attacks. It is worth remembering that these immigrant workers are shoring up vital industries in this part of Northern Ireland.'</p> <p>Trimble supported the demands by the SDLP deputy mayor of Craigavon, Ignatius Fox, for a special police patrol to monitor racist incidents in Portadown.</p> <p>'The authorities should look at the idea of a special patrol to keep an eye on the areas where Portuguese and other immigrant workers and their families are clustered in and around Craigavon,' he added.</p> <p>Councillor Fox said the special patrols should be organised on the same lines as similar patrols in Dungannon, where there has been a spate of racist incidents over the summer.</p> <p>The chairman of the local District Policing Partnership, the DUP's Jonathan Bell, called for tougher prison sentences for racists. He added: 'The council would be united ... in unequivocally condemning those who perpetrate these actions and seeking to have them made amenable to the courts at the earliest opportunity.'</p>",
  "Asked how the battle was going, Commander Abu Mohammad Hilu showed off his latest trophy - a blood-drenched American boot. There was a large bullet hole in the middle. 'We found it after last night's battle,' the commander explained. His colleague, Abu Ali, added: 'Originally there was an American foot inside it and a bit of the leg. But we took it out and threw it to the dogs.' <p>But the most tangible evidence of the Mahdi army's extraordinary self-confidence yesterday, however, came too close for comfort half an hour earlier. We had been driving through the high street in Kufa, another stronghold of the Shia cleric Muqtada Sadr, some three kilometres from the shrine where he and his supporters are still holed up. </p> <p>We stopped to inspect a building - this was a mistake. Mahdi army soldiers armed with Kalashnikovs spotted us, then targeted us. In a convoy of two cars, with guns pointing and pushing at us, we were taken to Kufa's mosque. </p> <p>Ten minutes later The Observer's Iraqi fixer got us released after phoning a high-ranking Sadr aide. </p> <p>The aggression disappeared, the fighters turned profusely apologetic. More than two weeks after launching their uprising in Najaf, the Mahdi army was - despite reports to the contrary - still in control of Najaf's Imam Ali shrine - and much of the rest of Iraq. Yesterday fighting carried on.</p> <p>In pre-dawn darkness, American tanks and Humvees also staged a raid on Kufa, trundling down the high street and past the library. Commander Hilu and his men were waiting. </p> <p>'The Americans went as far as the mosque then got out,' the commander said, having escorted me back to the scene of what, he suggested, was a heroic victory. </p> <p>'It was an ambush. All of a sudden we started shooting them. They were surprised. We destroyed two of their tanks.' </p> <p>Hilu showed off the newly incinerated Kufa court building just across the road. Here, he said, US troops had taken refuge under fire. Crunching over the melted remains of ceiling fans, he pointed to a small annexe room soaked in blood. </p> <p>'They treated their wounded in here. They were firing in the air at the same time. That's a piece of American brain,' he added helpfully. 'We found the boot nearby.' </p> <p>Over the past 17 days the standoff between Sadr's Shia militia and Iraq's US-backed interim government has been portrayed as a conflict that the renegade cleric will eventually lose. In fact, he is winning. </p> <p>On Friday afternoon Iraq's interior minister claimed his police had taken control of Najaf's Imam Ali shrine and arrested several hundred 'lightly armed' fighters. </p> <p>It was a boast that might have come from Saddam Hussein's notoriously unreliable information minister, 'Comical Ali'. </p> <p>Arriving at the mosque a couple of hours later, I found nothing had changed. Hundreds of unarmed supporters of Sadr still loafed on mats inside the shrine's courtyard. </p> <p>In the narrow alleyways around the mosque, Mahdi army fighters - one wearing a black Manchester United strip - chatted in the late afternoon sunshine. </p> <p>Yesterday Sheikh Azhar Kenani, head of Kufa mosque, told The Observer that his fighters would mow down Iraqi troops, should they attempt to storm the shrine. </p> <p>'One hundred per cent there will be a massacre,' the sheikh predicted. 'The Iraqi police are agents of the Americans. We will not allow the US's agents or the Americans themselves to occupy this holy site.' </p> <p>Sadr's uncompromising rejection of foreign occupation does not resonate with all Iraqis, but has the virtue of intellectual consistency. </p> <p>'The interim government is illegitimate and doesn't represent the Iraqi nation. Therefore we reject it,' the sheikh said. </p> <p>He added: 'We demand that all occupying forces leave our country.' Who did he think would win the battle for Najaf? 'We will. The Americans are fighting because of money. But we are fighting by the power of God.' </p> <p>The sheikh said that his colleagues inside Najaf's shrine were trying to hand over the mosque's keys to representatives of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani - Iraq's most revered Shia cleric. </p> <p>But he has been reluctant to embroil himself in the crisis and is currently receiving heart treatment in London. The gesture is unlikely to end the standoff, the sheikh admitted. </p> <p>Sitting cross-legged on a carpet outside Kufa's gold-domed mosque, over cups of sweet black tea, other Mahdi army fighters yesterday said they had no intention of giving up. </p> <p>Nearby, a group of men were carrying away the latest martyr for burial - killed at 3am yesterday when an American tank blew a hole through the west corner of the neighbouring Maitham Tamar mosque. </p> <p>'I lost three fingers while fighting in the cemetery last week,' Abu Muqtada, 38, explained, waving his bandaged right hand. 'An American helicopter shot me from the sky. But my other hand is still working. I can fight with that.' </p> <p>Muqtada admitted that many of his comrades had been killed in the cemetery, the vast rambling area to the north of Najaf's old city, where intense fighting took place last week. 'We take away all our dead friends,' he pointed out. 'We clean them up and give them a proper burial.' </p> <p>Inside the blue-painted police station on the edge of Najaf, meanwhile, there is little appetite for an apocalyptic final battle with the Mahdi army. </p> <p>But even if American forces do seize the shrine, it seems unlikely that the Sadr insurgency raging across Shia Iraq will disappear. </p> <p>In Kufa, there are no Americans to be seen. There is, however, plenty of damage. The College of Economics, which overlooks the shimmering Euphrates river, had a large Edam-shaped hole gouged out of its roof by an American bomb early yesterday. </p> <p>US warplanes control the skies above Kufa, dropping two bombs at 7am yesterday on a deserted mosque. But they don't control its streets - or the densely packed alleys around Najaf's shrine, where the Mahdi army appears to have shrugged off nights of bombardment. 'It was a big battle. They came at us from four directions,' Hilu said. </p> <p>'None of the soldiers in my unit were injured.' He added: 'You will write about the boot, won't you?'</p>",
  "Asylum applications have fallen sharply to roughly the levels that Tony Blair inherited when he took office, statistics are expected to reveal this week. <p>Ministers will seize on the figures to claim they have finally turned the corner on the issue. However, they are expected to trigger a fierce political row over whether clampdowns on asylum have worked or whether people are now simply entering the country as illegal immigrants and working on the black market.</p> <p>The figures were not published in the same format in 1997, making exact comparisons difficult. But in May 1997 when Blair was elected, there were 2,590 asylum applications a month, excluding dependants. Asylum applications rose steadily from 1997 to 2002, peaking in October of that year with 8,900 applicants. By the first quarter of 2004, applications were running at around 2,980 a month excluding dependents, requiring only a drop of another 13 per cent to bring them back to 1997 levels.</p> <p>Reducing the asylum figures to those of seven years ago would be a crucial psychological breakthrough, making it harder for Tory leader Michael Howard to attack the government over immigration.</p> <p>Keith Best of the Immigration Advisory Service, which handles refugees' cases, said the trend was clearly downwards. He cited the toppling of oppressive regimes such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan, which have previously driven large movements of refugees, as a major reason.</p> <p>'The figures are down and I think genuinely down, but that's not surprising. Look at the places which traditionally have generated large numbers of asylum seekers, like Iraq, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Somalia - all of those countries are going through a period of comparative quiescence. If Iraq was to blow up into full-scale civil war then we could find a very different situation.</p> <p>'But mercifully there isn't massive persecution, other than in Darfur. And the reality of Darfur is that, sadly, the people there haven't even got enough money to get to the next sack of corn, let alone take a flight to London.'</p> <p>Figures covering the period April to June 2004 are published on Tuesday. Ministers are expected to claim that recent Home Office measures, such as the extension of border controls to the Eurostar terminals in France and Belgium, and clamping down on support and accommodation for asylum seekers who do not apply immediately they enter the country, are finally bringing results.</p> <p>But Best said headline-grabbing policies were only likely to have a real effect on those already in the UK who might previously have claimed asylum after exhausting other means of staying here, rather than those still overseas who have only a hazy idea of the rules: 'Whatever the Home Secretary does is not really the talk around the coffee pots in the tents of Kurdistan. If you don't communicate the deterrent measures to those who are meant to be deterred, they can't be deterred.'</p> <p>Best said there was no proof that would-be asylum seekers were turning to illegal entry instead and that the closure of the Sangatte camp near Calais had reduced opportunities to sneak in: 'You can't prove it one way or the other. We have always suspected that there is still a considerable amount of clandestine entry going on, but significantly less now that they have closed Sangatte,' he said.</p> <p>But the government remains exposed on its inability to remove failed asylum seekers swiftly. Ministers are also braced for fresh embarrassment with the publication later this month of a book by Steve Moxon, the immigration caseworker who recently exposed the routine abuse of work visas granted to eastern Europeans. He is expected to expand on his criticisms of the immigration service and detail how he was sacked for whistleblowing.</p> <p>David Davis, the shadow Home Secretary, said last night that the immigration service was still in 'absolute chaos' and there were serious doubts over whether ministers had reduced the figures by failing to tackle hidden, illegal immigration: 'If the government really had got to grips with the asylum system, Parliament wouldn't be continually presented with vast amounts of hastily drafted asylum legislation,' he said. 'Labour have failed to remove failed asylum seekers at the level they promised. The number of asylum seekers deported in 2003 was just 17,040 - 43 per cent short of their target of over 30,000 promised in their manifesto.'</p> <p>The Home Office refused to comment last night pending publication of the official statistics.</p>",
  "<p>Let's push David Blunkett and Kimberly Fortier to the side of the stage for a moment. Let's move Italo Calvino and Elsa de'Giorgi into the spotlight so they can do their 'kiss me, hold me, possess me' act of 'infinite desire'. But remember, all the world's a stage and these are merely players. </p> <p>Calvino, Italy's most revered 20th-century novelist, and de'Giorgi, sinuous star of Pasolini's Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom , had a passionate affair in the Fifties. The Corriere della Ser\u00e0 (via the Guardian's correspondent in Italy) tells us so. </p> <p>Italo wrote Elsa some 300 steamy letters of the 'I'll rip your clothes off' variety - and the Corriere is printing them. Calvino's widow, meanwhile, is trying to stop them.</p> <p>Will she succeed? Perhaps, on copyright grounds. But Calvino is a historic figure in Italian literature. His love life - like that of Ted Hughes, Salman Rushdie, Charles Dickens and countless others - matters to scholarship, biography and understanding. The writer and the actress belong together in chapters and footnotes. The Guardian, quite rightly, feels no shame about reporting this Italian job. </p> <p>And just the same imperatives apply to politics. When you assess Lloyd George, can you leave out all his rolls in the hay? How did Lady Dorothy Macmillan's liaison with Bob Boothby affect PM Supermac? Is any new biography of John Major complete without at least a paragraph on Edwina? </p> <p>Newspapers, for good or ill, are the first rough draft of history. What right, then, have they to leave out the rougher bits of history?</p> <p>Back to Blunkett and Ms Fortier, back to our Home Secretary, 57, and the 'attractive, married, brunette, American publisher, 43, of the Spectator ' (which the Daily Express, with peabrain populism, describes as 'the Tory Party's Bible').</p> <p>The News of the World began it all seven days ago: 'Blunkett's Affair with a Married Woman'. (Ms Fortier, with pious regard for proprieties, is not named at this juncture because it is 'unclear if her husband knows of the relationship'). Well, if Stephen Quinn wasn't clued up on Sunday, Monday brought sudden enlightenment, and the Sun. Here she was, covering all of page one, David's 'True Love' and, in her own estimation, 'a nice left-wing girl' to boot. </p> <p>Anything to add? Oh yes, she's five months pregnant. </p> <p>The Daily Mirror told us so on Tuesday, followed (puffing) by the Sun. Mr Quinn - otherwise known as the Home Secretary's 'love rival' - was apparently 'over the moon' about this second pending baby. Mr B, meanwhile, was 'deeply in love' and, by Thursday, wanting a DNA test to decide the unborn child's paternity. </p> <p>It was all what the former Sun editor, David Yelland, called 'a good old-fashioned Fleet Street barnstormer' in his Evening Standard column. Except, of course, that Fleet Street has ceased to exist in any good old-fashioned sense - and that this tale was full of bad, new-fangled, evasions. </p> <p>Who was dishing lurid and intimate dirt to the News of the World, Sun and Mirror on eerily orchestrated rent-a-quote basis? The NoW had a 'source' who reported the star-crossed couple as 'deeply in love - though neither know what the future may hold'. The Sun had 'a pal' who informed us that, 'like all affairs, it's extremely complicated'. The Mirror had 'a source' with a hotline to Blunkett's heart and a 'well-informed source' who did the DNA testing bit. </p> <p>Four or five separate sources? Or one, ubiquitous 'pal' picking up a different phone to a different editor's office every day? How many Deep-Love Throats make a week of permutating yarns? That was one intriguing thing. Another was: what would editors without this pal in steamy places do next? </p> <p>The Times, in the wake of the Sun, went one way. They ran a five-paragraph story in column eight of page two entitled 'Blair backs \"love affair\" Blunkett'. The Home Secretary had issued a statement calling for privacy; the PM (via his official spokesman) praised the 'excellent job' he was doing. </p> <p>But the Independent, Telegraph and Guardian defended Blunkett's privacy rather more comprehensively. They printed nothing whatsoever of the tale, not a jot, until the Guardian ran a Tuesday leader about a 'politician' and a 'married woman' that lamented 'the poisonous effect on public life' of this new 'voyeurism' - and the Telegraph, on Thursday, produced a media commentary deriding the Guardian for not naming the Telegraph company employee, Ms Fortier, who had otherwise passed totally unmentioned to Telegraph readers.</p> <p>How knotted-up could you get? The Times, on Wednesday, produced a leader of its own that sought to define a flexible, if nebulous, public-interest test for senior politicians caught playing away. Should exposure - or silence - depend on press judgments about whether they were commendable souls or bruising targets? Should voters be totally denied the facts about Blunkett, 'a plausible contender for the post of Prime Minister'? </p> <p>The Mirror dug out a Blunkett speech proclaiming that 'marriage is an expression of stability'. Solicitors for Mr Quinn's 22-month-old son started sending out heavy privacy letters citing the Press Complaints Commission code. Like the Independent and an uncharacteristically coy Spectator, Blunkett, Ms Fortier and Mr Quinn (as opposed to that yammering 'pal') still said nothing.</p> <p>How on earth do you make sense of (and find principle in) this rancid stew? No wonder the leader writers and commentators are having such a torrid time, too. </p> <p>David Blunkett, a miracle of sympathy and admiration, is a widely liked and respected minister. Maybe, as he says, 'my personal life is my business'. But is that line - the legal line that kept President Mitterrand's illegitimate child out of any French paper until after his death - one that can possibly work in Britain, or anywhere today in an internetted world? Ms Fortier's husband makes a difference. Her pregnancy makes a difference. Any US Senator or President in a similar situation would be taken to the cleaners - exposed without recourse by a clear public right to know, a victim of the First Amendment.</p> <p>Construct a law, or PCC code, that puts all that under wraps and you turn Britain into a phoney island of isolation where the chattering classes know everything and only a muffled propriety afflicts the proletariat. Abdication, Mrs Simpson? It doesn't work. It cannot hold.</p> <p>Nor, in truth, does selective silence. 'What of those Britons who don't want to know this stuff?' asks the Guardian. What indeed? The News of the World - with the biggest array of educated, prosperous ABC1 readers of any national - has dished the dirt. Five mass-circulation tabloids and the Times have ploughed in behind. An editor who feels distaste may decide to cater for the don't-want-to-knows, the non-chattering classes, but that also leaves his readers direly short of information once their Times-reading neighbour leans over the gate and starts yacking. Is that what newspapers are for? Not to print the news that consumes every wine-bar discussion? No paper, in truth, is an island. </p> <p>The plain fact here, at the end of a very rocky road, is that Blunkett has no effective privacy if he has indeed fathered a child by a married - and prominent - magazine publisher: two public figures, US-style, for the price of one. </p> <p>The plain fact is that if history finds a public interest and significance in such things, then that interest also exists here and now. The plain fact is that politicians pleading for a law to shield them evoke small public sympathy (and much practical human interest). The plain fact is that Downing Street put its own defence on the record, there to be reported. The plain fact is that no code or legal drafting covers every case. One law for Blunkett and another for toe-sucking Tory ministers or EU commissioners having (alleged) affairs with MEPs? </p> <p>Italo Calvino and his beautiful Elsa belong to posterity and academia now. They are, and always were, history. David Blunkett's footnote was written last week (and will probably trail into nothingness henceforth - career and public regard unaffected - unless a Times story about his call to the US Embassy about a passport for Kimberly's kid gathers steam. But that's not quite the last word. Leave that to the pal, the source, the curiously gabby friend. </p> <p>Who he or she? A PR expert with good contacts and a heavyweight client, perhaps. A chef with many stinking fish to fry for reasons yet unknown - but reasons that will leak one day. And then we can all sit in judgment on a clutch of 'good, old-fashioned Fleet Street' red-tops, the ones with the hole in their circulation bucket. This story needs its whys and wherefores, the name of the source on the end of the phone, to make any sort of clinching sense. </p> <p>Who's out to get who? Eating a rancid stew doesn't mean you can't feel righteously nauseous later.</p> <p><strong>Hello, good morning, and goodbye</strong></p> <p>America cherishes its grand old media men. Walter Cronkite, 87, finally packed up last week. Mike Wallace, 86, the famous 60 Minutes anchorman, got into - frankly unbelievable - trouble for allegedly assaulting two New York traffic cops. This political convention season is a final tour of reverence for Tom Brokaw. </p> <p>But here it's all different. Sir David Frost is a mere 65 and, bang, there goes his Sunday breakfast show after a paltry 12 years. The BBC is an oddly brutal auntie when push comes to shove.</p> <p>And so we gather to play the game of after-Frostie-who? Andrew Marr again? Andrew Neil again? A dilemma. Sir David, in his latter years, was the nice, softish interview for expansive politicians, more Jimmy Young than Paxman. And that had benefits for a Corporation wanting access to, and niceness from, its political masters. Sometimes, as Larry King shows at CNN, you don't need rottweiler growls; you need a non-confrontational chat. Does the Beeb have anyone nice enough left to field?</p> <p><strong>Assassination Street</strong></p> <p>One of the quaintest traditions of 'old-fashioned Fleet Street' was the way proprietorial dog seldom savaged dog. An illicit affair, Lord Copper? Grubby work at the financial crossroads? Somehow it seldom got written up in rival sheets. Robert Maxwell jumped off his boat of his own accord. Lord Black of Crossharbour came safe to harbour many times. </p> <p>But no longer. Richard Desmond is something of a mad dog when it comes to the Rothermere dynasty and the Barclay brothers had barely set foot in Telegraph Towers last week before a formidable clutch of Times reporters unleashed a double whammy about the reclusive duo's Japanese partners and early East End property struggles on the road to a billion.</p> <p>No killer facts, perhaps, but quite a few hitherto unpublished connections. The Barclays are singularly unamused. Will their Telegraph lash back at the Murdochs p\u00e8re et fils , just as the Mail and Express fought a no-score draw? It's a poser. You don't want any great enterprise to be off investigatory limits. But the obscure agitation, and legally tortured prose that goes with it, can be a bit of a literary dog's breakfast.</p>",
  "<p>Intense international competition: this has been the hallmark of this summer's sport. It was evident in England's dismal showing at the European football championships in Portugal and now at the Olympics in Greece. But while our footballers had no excuse, our Olympians deserve credit. There have been some great performances, even though for many, the domestic facilities they have to train with rank far below those of our competitors. It begs the question: how well we could do with the right investment? </p> <p>We should not be surprised. A lack of investment has characterised our approach to most things. Indeed, even in the first couple of years of this government there was a famine in public sector spending that, thankfully, has now turned into a feast, particularly on health and education. Trouble is, it is still difficult to measure how successful such spending has been. Indeed, once there is a gap between the payer and the recipient of a service there will be huge disparities in the quality on offer. This is compounded by vested interest groups that always want to put a positive slant on things. Thus, despite more money, we still lag internationally on our public services. </p> <p>Yet last week, there appeared to be some good news on education. A-level grades are up. Education for education's sake is welcome and, as happens at the Olympics, over time standards ought to rise. The biggest problem is that such results may create unrealistic expectations. But quite simply the standard has to rise, given what is happening overseas. For instance, at Standard Chartered bank, last year's graduate intake saw almost 300 applicants from around the world for each place, with more than a quarter of offers going to students from China. </p> <p>Our best students can compete internationally, but many firms are concerned about the wider skills base. Perhaps this is justified. Nick Gibb, the Tory MP and member of the education and skills select committee, has pointed out that '23 per cent of adults in Britain cannot read properly (they cannot, for example, determine the correct amount of medicine to give a child from information printed on the package). Britain's education system ranks a poor 20th out of 41 OECD countries in reliable international comparisons'. The trouble with international data is that it is old, but it does highlight the scale of the problem facing Britain, even if standards are now rising. </p> <p>More students are going to uni versity. That is good. Yet it is too early to judge the overall economic benefit. It may even prove negative, as for the first time in more than three decades, the place where most graduates want to work is not the City, not industry, but the public sector. Perhaps it is the lure of final-salary pensions, many of which are unfunded, pointing to an increased tax bill at some stage. </p> <p>Indeed, public sector employment has risen sharply. Despite the Chancellor's recent announcement of cuts in civil service jobs, close to half a million extra public sector posts have been created since 1997. It seems that the fur ther one moves from London, the greater such public employment has been in keeping the housing market underpinned, despite rising interest rates. An effective regional policy for a government seeking re-election. </p> <p>One consequence of all of this is an increased tax and regulatory environment that industry fears will challenge it in the future. This is a genuine concern, particularly as we need to see more investment by firms. For despite the strength of the economy, the reality is that the two big areas of growth are dri ven by debt - public debt and consumer debt. </p> <p>Too much regulation and taxation would hurt the competitiveness of British firms. Yet one area where the government deserves credit is on its international agenda with respect to Africa. In the second half of next year, Britain assumes the presidency of both the EU and the G7. The focus will be on poverty reduction. Such an initiative should be good for Africa and also for changing perceptions of Britain. </p> <p>As part of my job, I have spent about six months of each of the last couple of years travelling abroad. During that time Britain's international standing has gone down, France's up. Yet, there is still a positive international view of our economy and perhaps there will be scope to push this agenda. The agenda is not new. All of what is being suggested was in the 1979 Brandt report. Then, there was much talk and little action. </p> <p>For now, Africa is being helped out by the unlikeliest of sources: China, which is slowly becoming the key counterbalance to the US in the world economy. In previous cycles it used to be Europe and Japan that counterbalanced America. No longer. Europe's economic model is creaking, its population ageing and its potential growth rate slowing. It will enjoy high living standards, but compared with Asia it is not the market to look to. Instead, Asia is booming. And just as China is now driving growth in east Asia, India has the potential to do likewise in south Asia, which houses one fifth of the world's population. </p> <p>Asia also holds the key to US economic prospects. Despite talk of America's military might, its economy has to borrow one and a half million dollars per minute (yes, per minute) from the rest of the world to finance its trade deficit. So far this has not been a problem, but only because Asia is prepared to help. A decade ago, Asian central banks held one third of global currency reserves. Now, they hold two thirds, the bulk in dollars. </p> <p>And it is not just the US government - American firms are becoming more dependent on Asia, too. Take China. Despite the political hype about America wanting China to revalue its currency, the reality is that three quarters of firms exporting from China are foreign, the bulk of them American. </p> <p>Of course, as China opens up, its authorities will lose some control. There will be increased volatility. But those who are expecting China to collapse will be disappointed. Even if there is a hard landing for the Chinese economy the impact is likely to be like last year's Sars epidemic - dramatic and headline-grabbing, but only temporary. </p> <p>This process is forcing India to change. India's recent election result showed not everyone is happy with change, but there is progress none the less. While there has been much focus on call centres, the reality in India is that they wish to take advantage of their domestic skills and move up the value curve into higher quality services such as consultancy, sub-editing and health care. </p> <p>In short, services such as manufacturing are now open to intense international competition, based not only on price but on quality. Where then does this leave the UK? Asia offers a great challenge, but also a wonderful opportunity as a future growth market. The area in which we have the most advantage is financial services. </p> <p>London has heeded the Wimbledon effect. Britain has the best tennis tournament in the world, but never wins it. But the important thing is that the tournament is held here. Similarly the City is no longer dominated by British firms, but at least it is here. This is one sporting lesson we have learnt as we face up to the global challenges ahead. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Gerard Lyons is the chief economist at Standard Chartered. William Keegan is away</p>",
  "<p>Britain's growing obsession with gambling will this week lift hotel and betting firm Hilton Group's six-month profits to record-breaking levels.</p> <p>Hilton's betting arm, Ladbrokes, the UK's leading gaming firm, has seen surging profits thanks to the installation of virtual casino machines plus a strong performance from its e-gaming division, in particular online poker. Profits before tax for Hilton are expected to be \u00a3170 million, against \u00a3110.5m last year. </p> <p>Hilton will also confirm the long-awaited recovery in its 400 hotels, which have been hit by terrorist fears, the Iraq war and hysteria over the Sars virus. </p> <p>Stronger hotel figures will spark speculation that the firm could demerge its lodging and gambling businesses next year - but only if the hotel recovery is sustained. Ladbrokes insiders have long wanted to be spun off from Hilton. </p> <p>With gambling now a mainstream British leisure experience, bumper profits are being generated, which will prompt calls for a windfall tax on bookies. This will be hugely resisted by the industry, which would threaten to move offshore should the measure be introduced. </p> <p>In two weeks' time, William Hill will also unveil profits that exceed last year's performance. Bosses say that the failure of favourites to perform at Euro 2004 and the British Open boosted performance. </p> <p>It is nearly two years since the tax on gamblers' winning was axed in favour of one on gaming firms' gross profits. </p> <p>Gambling firms' profits are expected to rise further following the introduction of legislation next year permitting casinos to install more slot machines with, for the first time, unlimited prizes. </p> <p>However, there are fears that the new laws will lead to escalating social problems as more punters become addicted.</p>",
  "<p><strong>For Ever Godard</strong><br>edited by Michael Temple, James S Williams and Michael Witt<br>Black Dog \u00a324.95, pp384</p> <p>Tate Modern is a huge, empty space predestined to be filled with hot air. It was here, appropriately enough, that a global contingent of semioticians, deconstructors and postmodern theorists convened three years ago to confer about Jean-Luc Godard. The results of their cogitating, including pseudo-learned diatribes on asynchrony, anamnesis and 'non-dialectisable alterity', now appear in this lavishly illustrated, utterly unreadable volume.</p> <p>Godard began, in the early days of the New Wave, as a pungent critic who also made tersely existential, abruptly brutal thrillers. Admiring American film noir, he had his own laconic definition of cinema: 'Film,' he declared, 'is a girl and a gun.' The girl, for preference, was the lush Brigitte Bardot, who simmers in Contempt; the gun was usually wielded by Jean-Paul Belmondo who, as the muddled gangster in Breathless, pays homage to the prototype he nicknames Bogey. Unfortunately, Godard forgot his own formula. His later work replaces girls and guns with ideologies, self-indulgently dissected. His explicators in the Tate symposium identify the change, without realising its cause for dismay: 'The image... becomes first a question, and second a critique', so a film turns into 'a scripto-visual essay'.</p> <p>But once the image ceases to be simply an image, is there any need to look at it? Godard himself absolves us from having to do so, and makes one of his characters declare that the image is 'the gaze of nothingness upon us'. This may sound exalted in French, but somehow the idea evaporates in translation.</p> <p>Look at what happens to the possibly poisoned glass of milk Cary Grant brings to Joan Fontaine in Hitchcock's Suspicion when the Godardians go to work on it. 'The glass of milk is an \"image\" in two opposed yet interconnected ways,' opines Jacques Ranci\u00e8re. 'First, it is an agent of condensation. Second, it is an agent of dispersion.' Does he mean that Cary Grant dropped the glass? You can taste the milk curdling as the analysis lumbers on. You can also hear Hitchcock wearily grumbling: 'It's only a movie.'</p> <p>It's possible to talk or write endlessly about the later Godard, which is why he so engrosses the academic hacks who teach film studies. What I defy anyone to do is watch the films. Godard the 'media icon', a senescent enfant terrible, is, as Temple and Williams put it, 'universally recognisable and yet totally unknown'.</p> <p>His phantasmal reputation somehow survives his dozens of recent failures, which range from a two-minute video clip on Sarajevo to a four-hour meditation on cinematic history, consisting entirely of garbled, uprooted quotes.</p> <p>The contributors to this book faithfully embellish his mystique by channelling the entire cultural history of the West through him. It's rather like the dash through the Louvre by the cast of Bande \u00e0 part, who cram a museum tour into 24 hectic seconds. The essays are equally incoherent, though not quite as exhilarating.</p> <p>One critic presents Godard's work as a solution to the quarrel between 'the dialogical and the technical' represented by the different philosophical methods of Socrates and Aristotle. Another celebrates him for performing Christ-like miracles, since, in Godard's view, the image can bring about the resurrection of the dead.</p> <p>A third participant contributes to his deification by asserting that Godard 'is crucified between what he can no longer do and what he cannot yet do'. His imaginary martyrdom on Golgotha, I presume, refers to his failure to extract funds from producers.</p> <p>Colin MacCabe's essay offers some wry evidence of Godard's financial hard-headedness and his slippery interpretation of contracts, but concludes by applying the same inflationary rhetoric. Piling up loose analogies, he arrives at a fatuous cosmic overstatement: 'The basic topic is simple,' he says. But this is MacCabe's notion of simplicity: 'Like Major Amberson, like Godard, like the millennium, we confront a death which poses the most urgent questions about art and the possible deaths of art.' Can MacCabe be saying that the film in question is a dead duck?</p> <p>The illustrations show off the 'auteurist' cult at its craziest. A poster for Godard's King Lear consists of 11 heads of Shakespeare, with Godard's grizzled phiz completing the set; another poster for H\u00e9las pour moi aligns the surnames of the director and the star, G\u00e9rard Depardieu, picking the letters GOD and DIEU in red.</p> <p>Alas, I'm unprepared to revere Godard as a fecund universal creator, a colleague for Shakespeare or for God. Toiling through this book is more like waiting for Godot - and he, as you know, never turns up.</p>",
  "In a poor country that lacks railways - reliant on its roads for food supplies - it is the small things that are indicative of how Nepal is being hurt by the Maoist rebels' five-day blockade of Katmandu. <p>In a few days the price of tomatoes has doubled, in common with other perishables. Some stores have been left with only a few days of fresh produce and cooking oil after less than a week of the blockade. The government has said that it has stocks of other staples to last a month. </p> <p>Friday's Maoist bombs in the capital may have hurt no one, but the Maoists are putting the squeeze on where it hurts most. </p> <p>And it is a strange thing, this blockade. Without roadblocks, it is being enforced by fear and threat alone, emptying the main routes into the capital. It has trapped travellers by their thousands, and confronted King Gyanendra with the brutal arithmetic of the Nepalese crisis - how easily his country can be throttled. </p> <p>If the king's inner circle needs reminding, it is reiteration of Mao Zedong's prescription - that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun'. </p> <p>The gun that has been pointed at Katmandu has underlined the country's growing existential crisis amid the fragmentation and increasing lack of relevance of its political institutions confronted with revolution. </p> <p>That revolution itself has been fuelled by the endemic poverty of Nepal - which neither the monarchy nor the leaders of democratic parties that emerged in 1990 following the collapse of the panchayat system of royal governance have managed to address. </p> <p>But in the 14 years since the revocation of the panchayat constitution - which revoked a previous attempt at democracy and replaced it with a system of representative groups that acted as advisers to the king - the poverty-stricken Nepalis, especially in the west of the country where the Maoist revolt began, have seen little improvement to their conditions. </p> <p>Instead, political parties - in particular the faction-ridden leaderships of the Nepali Congress party and the United Marxist Leninists - have used their parties to build personal power rather than to tackle the country's massive social inequalities. </p> <p>Neither has Gyanendra's approach revealed any greater political acuity. Thrust into power after a palace massacre in June 2001, Gyanendra has shown no sign of understanding that an interventionist king is likely to exacerbate rather than solve his country's problems. </p> <p>His sacking of the government - despite his assurances that Nepal's future is with a multi-party democracy - has done little except make the Maoists' indoctrination of a rural peasant class against him easier. </p> <p>It has also not been helped by the human rights abuses that have been committed by the government in their war with the Maoists. </p> <p>Earlier this year a report by the private Katmandu-based Informal Sector Service Centre placed the death toll for the eight-year Maoist insurgency at just under 9,200, blaming government forces for 1,622 of the deaths and the Maoists for another 819, with the rest of the killings taking place in unclear circumstances. </p> <p>Amnesty International has also expressed its concern about the deteriorating human rights situation in Nepal, accusing the government of arbitrary arrests, extra-judicial executions and torture and the Maoists of killings, abductions and child recruitment. </p> <p>With the Maoists determinedly uninterested in joining any rejuvenated democratic process - and with little sign that the other actors can appeal to Nepal's embittered poor - the country seems fated to slide into further crisis and bloodshed.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Eichmann: His Life and Crimes</strong><br>by David Cesarini<br>William Heinemann \u00a320, pp352</p> <p>The trial of Adolf Eichmann made him the global face of the Holocaust. But his exact role in the atrocities remained buried by courtroom rhetoric, sloppy reporting or overly ideological analysis. To some, he was a classic Nazi: a depraved, criminal, socially inadequate \u00fcber bully. Others saw a bureaucrat made into a mass murderer by totalitarianism, who counted Jews instead of beans. This gripping, lucid, meticulously researched book reveals that both views are wrong.</p> <p>David Cesarani shows there was nothing in Eichmann's relatively comfortable childhood and youth to indicate any lack of sociability. As an adult, he was garrulous and popular. After a hard day in his Berlin office organising mass deportations in 1943, the handsome, charming, popular SS officer would go to musical soirees with his staff.</p> <p>The question of when the Nazis decided to exterminate Europe's Jews is much debated. The Wannsee conference in Berlin in January 1942, at which a dozen senior Nazis discussed the practical difficulties and decided on a plan of action, is often seen as the turning point. Eichmann, then head of the only Nazi administrative department devoted to Jewish affairs, helped to organise the conference.</p> <p>Then he applied himself with singleminded vigour to rounding up as many Jews as possible and deporting them to the death camps being built.</p> <p>But by the time of the conference, at least half-a-million Jews had already been killed by the SS 'Einsatzgruppen' in eastern Europe alone. Cesarani, like most contemporary scholars, sees Wannsee as an attempt to systematise what was already happening on an ad-hoc basis.</p> <p>The descent into an attempted mass killing of more than 11 million people was gradual, occurring over a decade at least. And in this lies the key to understanding Eichmann.</p> <p>Born in the Rhineland in 1906, he joined the Nazis in 1933. He was not a 'Jew-hater' then. His anti-semitism was simply that of most right-wing, provincial, conservative Germans or Austrians. He wound up in the Jewish Department of one of the main Nazi intelligence agencies almost by accident. As Eichmann was sucked deeper into the Nazi cult, he became more viciously anti-semitic.</p> <p>In 1938, after Germany annexed Austria, Eichmann was sent to Vienna to head the Office for Jewish Emigration where, through 'terror and chicanery', he was extremely effective.</p> <p>Many see his time there as the beginning of 'the Final Solution'. Certainly, the Jews were seen by the Nazis as a cancer that must be cut out. Cesarani, however, argues persuasively that emigration was still the preferred option. Indeed, in 1940, Eichmann hatched a plan to ship four million Jews to Madagascar. It would entail massive casualties, but was still not deliberate genocide.</p> <p>A key step was taken at about this time during the 'cleansing' of western Poland to make room for ethnic Germans evacuated from Soviet-held areas. Eichmann was intimately connected with the brutal eviction of 500,000 people, gaining experience of managing mass deportation.</p> <p>As the war progressed, it became clear that emigration was not going to render the Reich judenfrei. So the Nazis decided to kill them.</p> <p>From Berlin, Eichmann ran operations to collect Jews and ship them to the camps. Trains had to be sourced and timetabled; they had to be found, stripped of their property and transported. There were problems with local commanders unwilling to have Jews dumped on them, obstreperous underlings and distant, wilful superiors. Eichmann was vastly assisted by the prevailing European anti-semitism. In Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, locals happily helped round up and, in some instances, kill Jews. In France, the Nazis trailed the Vichy regime in efforts at persecution.</p> <p>Between April and July 1944, Eichmann, based in Budapest, ruthlessly and efficiently rounded up 437,000 Hungarian Jews and deported them to Auschwitz. By that time, he was 'rotten from the inside out'. Fanatical, drunk with power, in the grip of a 'lethal delusion', Eichmann's descent, like that of his nation, was complete.</p> <p>As the Soviets closed in, he fled to Germany and then, helped by the Vatican, to Argentina, from where he was kidnapped by the Israelis in 1960, tried and executed in 1962.</p> <p>Eichmann was not born a killer. He became one, stage by grisly stage. He found the mechanics of murder (while observing a mass shooting, he had brains splattered over his leather coat) disgusting. But he worked fanatically to destroy millions of human beings. He did it because, for a variety of personal, professional and ideological reasons and because of the circumstances he found himself in, it seemed the right thing to do. Eichmann was a normal man who became a monster. As Cesarani concludes: 'Everyman as genocidaire.' And that is a lesson for our bloody times.</p>",
  "<p>While he was researching Down and Dirty Pictures, his book about the rise of the American independent film industry, Peter Biskind asked each of the directors he spoke to a question. If there was a movie of the book he was writing, who should play supersized Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein? </p> <p>There would be a long pause. Some would say it had to be Sidney Greenstreet, others James Gandolfini, of Sopranos fame. A few believed the role could only have been played by Marlon Brando. Biskind is not sure that any of them exactly fitted the bill. 'Harvey,' he says, 'stubbornly resists casting.' </p> <p>Just as, in Biskind's view, Weinstein hijacked American independent cinema in the last decade, so he has also hijacked Biskind's book. The author went through the motions of broadening his project, detailing the successes and failures of October Films, the emergence of Sony Pictures Classics, the humbug of Robert Redford's Sundance festival, but this is really about Harvey. </p> <p>Biskind details with some appalled glee the food stains on Weinstein's shirts, the thuggish threats to journalists, the thrown telephones, the impossible demands to directors, the bullying of staff. He talks of Weinstein as an 'artist of anger' and as 'the 800lb gorilla in the corner'. Really, though, he is his Moby Dick, his white whale. No matter how often the journalist seems to have harpooned his target, Harvey keeps emerging from the deep, clutching a contract and a side order of fries. </p> <p> Down and Dirty Pictures is a sequel to Biskind's spectacular inside story of Seventies Hollywood, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls. Again, he embeds himself on the front line between art and commerce, integrity and greed, and watches the flak fly. These days, though, all the firepower comes from the suits. And whereas with Coppola, Beatty and Friedkin, it was sex and drugs and ego that got in the way of film-making, lately it is really only cash that corrupts. The drama was once in getting films made; now, in Biskind's account, it is mostly played out post-production, in marketing meetings and conference calls about distribution rights. As a result, I suggest to him, it is harder to find heroes in this book. </p> <p>Biskind points to Quentin Tarantino. 'I also think [Steven] Soderbergh is a hero, and David O Russell [director of Spanking the Monkey].' Of these, only Tarantino emerges from Biskind's pages with quite the force that attended a Scorsese or a Paul Schrader, and everyone, even these three, even Biskind, nowadays seems obsessed with bottom line. To sell out or not to sell out has long ceased to be the question. As actor Ethan Hawke, one of the few interviewees who seems genuinely depressed by the industry's venality, said to Biskind: 'If actors and directors now have a corporate mentality, then who in the world doesn't have a corporate mentality?' </p> <p>Biskind sees in Miramax's approach to film-making paradigms of Nineties America: the slavishness to focus groups, the devotion to marketing over substance, the insistence that Miramax is a cool and independent company while Harvey rakes in the millions. Had Miramax not existed, would the best of the 'indiewood' films they made or distributed have been made elsewhere? The answer, says Biskind, in the case of their biggest successes, Pulp Fiction, say, or The Crying Game, is 'certainly yes'. He is not so sure about the likes of Shakespeare in Love or The English Patient, still less about Il Postino or Clerks. 'And who can say whether any of the films would have got their audience without Miramax's machine.' </p> <p>Peter Biskind grew up bookish in New York and studied English at Yale. He started teaching at university in California, at the height of the anti- Vietnam war movement. The lecture hall was not where it was at. 'I bought a little camera and started making films, one about a big oil spill in the Santa Barbara channel and the next about all these student demonstrations. I'd go to a class to teach and half my students would be in jail, so I documented that. I would go and show the film round other campuses.' </p> <p>As well as skipping afternoons to see Russ Meyer films, he was watching Antonioni, Bergman and all the French New Wave. 'I loved Godard,' he says, 'and the Polish postwar cinema, Andrej Wajda and all that.' </p> <p>He quit teaching and began film reviewing. He edited a film newspaper, Jumpcut, distributing it by hand in New York, and later became editor of the industry bible, Premiere. </p> <p>Is he, I wonder, really a frustrated film-maker at heart? </p> <p>'Only in the sense that I've wondered if I could do it,' he says. 'But I think it is a different skill set from writing books.' </p> <p>One of the things that impresses you, reading Biskind, is the sheer volume of his sources: no throwaway, two-word quote comes without its careful reference and, almost without exception, each reference, when you trace it in his notes, is to an 'AI' - author interview. Hardly anyone in the history of the world can have transcribed as many interview tapes. </p> <p>'It's really a question of a critical mass,' he says, smiling behind his lopsided moustache. 'There are always going to be people out there who won't talk to you. But once you put it to them who is talking, they see the attraction of putting their side of events.' </p> <p>His original motivation came in part from a desire to disrobe Hollywood's emperors. 'I'd been writing for these magazines and I was, like, so tired of reverential. The films may have been great, often were great, but the people who made them could be monsters. Artists often are. Picasso could be tricky. Dostoevsky was not always a nice guy. I just wanted to show some of that.' </p> <p>The Hollywood artists he wrote about have tended to respond to Easy Riders with varying degrees of bile (though you know for a fact that all of them sat up all night reading it, working out just who had dished what). Robert Altman suggested: 'It was hate mail. We were all lured into talking to this guy because people thought he was a straight guy but he was filling a commission from the publisher for a hatchet job. He's the worst kind of human being I know.' Robert Towne, screenwriter on Shampoo and Chinatown, quoted from Nietzsche: 'Sometimes our loathing for dirt is so great it prevents us from washing our hands.' </p> <p>Mostly, Biskind says, he has managed to avoid his subjects since Easy Riders came out, though not always. 'I was invited a couple of years ago on this short cruise around the Caribbean with some film people. So I walk on this ship and there's Francis Coppola. Now, I'm not a confrontational person, so my first thought was whether I could hide from him on the boat for a week or whatever. But it was only a small boat. So I thought I better go speak to him. He was sitting like a pasha by the swimming pool and I walked up and extended a hand, \"Hi Francis\".' </p> <p>Coppola stared at Biskind's hand like it was a dead fish. 'And then he starts laying into me about how I only spoke to these people who had hated him and so on.' The cruise became more painful when, one night, Biskind discovered he was to be interviewed in front of the other guests about his book, on stage. Coppola had volunteered to put the questions. 'It was like hell, really,' he says, quietly, but with some feeling. </p> <p>For the current book, his subjects got their retaliation in early. In his preface, Biskind describes being called into to Weinstein's office early on in his research. Harvey sat behind his big desk. 'The odour of menace hung in the air like the smell of burning tyres,' Biskind recalls. There was a baseball bat in the corner. Harvey offered to bankroll him to write another book, any other book, which Miramax would publish, if he would just not do this book on Miramax. Biskind declined. </p> <p>Since the book came out in America, the pair have not met. 'I live out of the city, so I don't go to a lot of openings. I know I will run into Harvey eventually, though,' Biskind says. 'It's sort of inevitable. I don't suppose he is going to drag me out in the street and break my legs. That would not be seen as a very cool thing to do. So, in a way, I'd rather get it over with.' </p> <p>In the meantime, Biskind has Miramax's formidable public-relations operation to spar with. </p> <p>'They've got these people who are a bit like Richard Nixon's truth squad - they hassle journalists I've talked to,' he says. 'It can pay off. Some journalists get intimidated. They have an amazing network of \"assets\", as they say. They call up and say I distorted this on page 43 or I exaggerated that on page 258.' (This point had been proved to me when, the night before I was due to interview Biskind at his hotel in Soho, The Observer office received a call from Miramax in London suggesting that the company's head of publicity in New York would love to talk to me about the story I was writing. I declined, mainly because I could only think of one question: how did they know?) </p> <p>For some people, Biskind's cynicism went too far when he turned it on Robert Redford's Sundance festival. In fact, his criticism of Redford is fairly benign. He comes across as a bit dull, a bit control freaky, a bit disorganised and very vain. Other than that, Biskind details the ways in which Sundance has become a market place, not a festival. I wonder why he thinks his criticism caused so much fuss? </p> <p>'Redford is untouchable in America,' Biskind says. 'He has the best press of any Hollywood figure ever. He has Sundance for a start, and then all his work with native Americans and the environment. To America, he is as pure as the driven snow.' </p> <p>Redford's response was to say at the time that he'd never seen Biskind at the festival. 'In fact, as he well knows, I used to sit on the advisory board for Sundance,' Biskind says. 'It was him who never used to turn up. Certainly, he was never very visible there until the festival started to make headlines.' </p> <p>Biskind has some fun with the 'granola' films of Sundance in the early years, designed to do you good. He describes well the shock the 'Sundanistas' felt on first seeing Reservoir Dogs, when, up to then, people in the festival's films 'had only died of old age, or possibly Aids'. Does he think that great films can emerge from a wholly supportive, liberal, democratic working environment? </p> <p>'Well, there are some examples. Even from companies like October and now perhaps Focus Features, which made Lost in Translation. A lot of these companies pride themselves on being Miramax-nice. They support their directors. Palace Pictures was wonderful for a while.' </p> <p>There is in that niceness, though, less of a story. Did he feel he had become of the devil's party without knowing it in this book? </p> <p>'I guess to an extent. You do become fascinated with outrageous stories, each one more unlikely than the last. You have to resist the temptation to lose yourself in them and just wallow. I did try, honestly.' </p> <p>Biskind shows no signs of overcoming that habit. His next book, no doubt in several volumes, will be an account of the secret lives of Warren Beatty. </p> <p>Is Beatty assisting with the project? </p> <p>'Not assisting exactly, no,' Biskind says. But then he wouldn't want it any other way. </p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong> Down and Dirty Pictures by Peter Biskind is published by Bloomsbury on 6 September</p>",
  "<p>When I was growing up in the Eighties, it was so unusual to see a black person in a television advert, it became a major event in our house. We'd lower our voices and pay them as much attention as the opening chimes of News at 10, watching with a mixture of pride and curiosity. Apart from such rare occasions, it was as if black people didn't exist in between programmes. We didn't count as potential customers. </p> <p>The big breakthrough came a decade later in a cereal advert featuring Linford Christie; he turned up at a school sports day to cheer on a black family, the first I'd seen in a commercial, inspiring the young boy to use PMA ('Positive Mental Attitude'). It was a simple idea and not a particularly good commercial, but it meant a lot to me. </p> <p>Flicking through the channels now, things are different; TV ads no longer look as if they were made for a segregated society. During the course of one evening recently, I saw Thierry Henry, Meera Syal and Howard Brown, the bespectacled face of the Halifax bank, fronting campaigns. Some of these new ads are cliched and stereotypical - black people tucking into buckets of fried chicken and colourful Indians breaking out into Bollywood song and dance routines - but they represent change. </p> <p>A few years ago, businesses were obsessed with the pink pound and grey pound, launching charm offensives at gay and older consumers. Now, they've turned their attention to ethnic minorities and the brown pound, worth \u00a332 billion according to a recent advertising industry report. </p> <p>The airwaves have changed as well. In the past, listening to black radio stations such as Kiss and Choice meant hearing a load of poor-quality ads for fast-food outlets and cheap foreign calls. These days, you'll hear commercials for stuff you've actually heard of. At last, it seems, black consumers are being taken seriously. </p> <p>'A lot of the change has come out of the success of black music. People have woken up to the fact they can sell lots of things to us,' says Michael Eboda, editor of the black newspaper, New Nation . </p> <p>Dizzee Rascal and Ms Dynamite, the last two Mercury Prize winners, began their careers as underground garage acts before they reached mainstream audiences. Asian singing stars enjoy Top 10 hits and Bollywood films mean big box-office. Asian media outlets are also flourishing. There are 29 Asian TV stations on Sky, 15 radio stations, and more than 30 newspapers and magazines. The jewel in this media crown is Sunrise Radio, which started as a pirate station in 1989, dodging the Department of Trade officials who wanted to confiscate its equipment. Now Sunrise reaches more than a million people. </p> <p>In publishing, Monica Ali and Zadie Smith have become literary stars with cleverly marketed books which have popularised the black and Asian British experience, while Andrea Levy's Small Island won the Orange Fiction Prize this year. But marketing to a crossover audience is tricky. Ali's publisher caused a row when it asked the Guardian not to send an Asian journalist to interview her because it didn't want its hot young author pigeonholed as an ethnic writer. </p> <p>Black fashion sense is also influential. Walk around any town centre and you will see teenagers of all races looking as if they are dressed for a hip hop video. 'We conducted a recent survey that said 70 per cent of our readers are heavily influenced by black culture and rap music,' says Annie Auberbach, editor of mykindaplace.co.uk, the UK's largest website for girls. 'All those pop idol shows have made pop music seem quite bland while R&amp;B is real glamour.' </p> <p>In October, the V&amp;A will launch a major exhibition, 'Black British Style', billed as the 'first exhibition in the UK to explore the style and fashion of black people in Britain and their impact on British culture over the past 50 years'. Increasingly, young black consumers have become a sought-after audience, not least because they are often seen as being the hippest consumers on the high street. With so much cultural activity, companies have had to take ethnic minorities seriously. </p> <p>At the beginning of the Nineties, Anjna Raheja was the head of marketing and PR on TV Asia, when she realised there was a 'huge niche market that wasn't being exploited'. </p> <p>So, 10 years ago, she created Media Moguls, a specialist marketing group for ethnic consumers. At first, Raheja struggled to find clients, but Media Moguls has flourished over the past few years; it helped to launch the BBC's Asian Network and created a campaign for Bend It Like Beckham . 'Attitudes are definitely starting to change,' says Raheja. 'We are the only specific ethnic minority agency in the IPA so when we make presentations they realise we speak the same language; we're not a threat but a potential solution.' </p> <p>Raheja encouraged companies to use ethnic media outlets to reach new audiences. But if advertisers really want to exploit the brown pound, they must try harder. Part of the problem is that few black and Asian people work in the industry. 'You can count on the fingers of one hand the number of senior executives who aren't white, so they should be looking at increasing that number,' says Michael Cudlipp, chair of the History of Advertising Trust. This year, the IPA set up its ethnic diversity project, hiring adman Mehboob Umarji to spend six months looking to attract more black and Asian staff. </p> <p>In his cramped office near London's Hyde Park, Umarji, a well-spoken thirty-something, chooses his words carefully. He's too smart to suggest his industry is a model equal-opportunities employer, but reckons it's getting better. The connection with the old-school- tie network is declining with the rise of younger, trendier agencies, but still many creative people don't know how to speak to an ethnic audience. </p> <p>'I recently saw an ice cream ad with the line \"Eenie Meanie Minie Mo\", which has big connotations. But it obviously went through the whole approval process. If anyone of ethnic origin had been involved they would have said, \"I'm not comfortable with this\", but the client and the agency let it go. It was potentially very offensive and it sets all the good work back,' he says. </p> <p>In fact, the history of ethnic minorities in advertising is depressing. In 2001, prompted by interest from academics and students, the History of Advertising Trust archive began research and found offensive adverts throughout the 20th century. 'Black people were used in soap-powder ads aimed at selling it to the servants of white households. The crude sense of humour made fun of black people who were depicted in the ads as being washed by whites. In the Eighties, you would see ads set in Africa featuring white hunters drinking rum served to them by black manservants,' says Cudlipp. </p> <p>'That's all gone now but occasionally you get funny throwbacks. There was a recent ad for a holiday club in the Bahamas that had a group of smart white people sitting around a bar being served by a rather egregious black barman. No doubt, there were black customers as well, but there was not one black man on the other side of the bar.' </p> <p>Even today, there is a tendency to show blacks and Asians in stereotypical roles: Asian shopkeepers and streetwise blacks still abound. Given only 30 seconds to make an impression, advertisers often fall back on obvious casting. Not all British Asians enjoy Bollywood films, but watch the commercials and you'd think they did. </p> <p>'You do see more black faces in ads but you have to look at how they appear. Are they in stereotypical roles? I suspect they are a lot of the time. I still think we see rather a lot of happy, smiling faces dancing etc because that is what people are used to,' says Eboda. </p> <p>Ira Joseph grimaces when I describe some of the old adverts to him. He is one of the few black creative people working in advertising and part of the team behind the 'Va Va Voom' campaign for the Renault Clio with Arsenal footballer Thierry Henry. Joseph is a football fan and when I arrive at his minimalist offices in central London, he is wearing an England football shirt. Walking through the open-plan office, I'm not sure what makes him stand out more - his colour or his clothing. Henry's part in the high-profile campaign has had largely favourable reviews but, more important, it was a good piece of colour-blind casting. </p> <p>'It was a big deal for Renault to go for it. I wasn't quite sure how they would react to it when we suggested it, but to their credit they totally bought into it. One of their top bods had a meeting with Thierry and Thierry charmed him,' says Joseph. 'It tends to be a bit of a struggle to get black people in front of the camera. You almost need to have a clich\u00e9d reason or, when you see black faces, they tend to be background artists.' </p> <p>The campaign brought back bad memories. 'I've worked in other agencies where we have tried to cast black families, and the research results have come back so negative. The last was seven or eight years ago. We had the idea of using a black family to promote a food product, but it was really resisted. I think attitudes have changed since, and it's not such a big deal,' he says. </p> <p>Using a sporting icon is one thing, but asking an unknown black man to be the public face of a company was, until recently, considered a risk too far. Rather than pulling in the brown pound, they were worried about alienating core consumers. Whether this was intentional racism or unfortunate second-guessing, the result was the same. </p> <p>Howard Brown was the manager of a Halifax branch in Birmingham when he responded to a company offer to employees of a chance to star in a commercial. Two thousand people auditioned, but Brown, who went along 'purely for fun', was chosen. </p> <p>'I had to do a cover version of Tom Jones's \"Sex Bomb\", which, funnily enough, I'd never heard before. Jones has a singular talent so I thought there was no point trying to copy him so I did it my own way,' Brown says. </p> <p>The ads have turned him into a kind of celebrity. He spends most of his time travelling the country making special appearances for Halifax, and is treated like a cross between a rock star and a reality-TV show winner. 'It's amazing,' he says. 'In Scotland, they had to close the branch doors because there were so many people trying to get in.' </p> <p>Brown, whose self-deprecating manner echoes his screen persona, thought little about his skin colour until he did an interview with Richard Littlejohn for Sky. 'He asked me about it. Of course I'm proud to be involved in something that has done well. I think we are making progress in the way we are represented,' he says diplomatically. </p> <p>Brown is a hit with black and Asian viewers. 'We're all gonna use Howard as an example, bless him,' says Raheja. 'What is good about him is that the character could be any colour and the ad works because of his personality.' </p> <p>But as companies develop more sophisticated approaches, they're finding that the brown-pound market is not easy to crack. There are cultural, religious, linguistic and generational differences within minority groups, so what strikes a chord with a middle-aged, first-generation Bengali is completely different from what might appeal to a fashionable twentysomething Bengali. </p> <p>If advertisers go on seeing ethnic audiences as a homogenous mass, they will fail. That doesn't mean, however, that blacks and Asians must always be specially targeted. 'We don't all read the Voice or listen to Kiss,' says Raheja. 'I read Marie Claire and watch E4, but when I come across an ad in an Asian magazine, it does have a different impact on me.' </p> <p>Earlier this year, COI Communications, the government's marketing and communications agency, published an extensive report on how to appeal to ethnic minorities. The respondents wanted to see cultural sensitivity and aspirational characters. Muslims, for instance, were impressed by an anti-smoking campaign by the Department of Health during Ramadan, suggesting that the religious fast was a good time to try to quit, while people of Chinese descent complained they were too frequently depicted working in takeaways. </p> <p>There is still some way to go. Not everyone believes the brown pound is worth chasing. Glossy black magazines such as Pride and Untold struggle to attract upmarket advertisers; in both, you are more like to see an advert for Hackney council than for Gucci. </p> <p>'It's still hard to get certain brands to advertise in our paper. There are a lot of companies [he mentions two popular clothing brands] that do very well out of the black community but aren't prepared to advertise in our publications. They're happy to use the fact that black is fashionable but when it comes to putting money into the community they are not so enthusiastic,' says Eboda. </p> <p>For second-generation Britons such as myself, the changes of the past decade or so are significant. Across the media, black and Asian culture and spending power are widely acknowledged. Watching television and listening to the radio is no longer the alienating experience it once was. Until more ethnic minorities are involved in marketing and advertising campaigns, until companies realise that simply putting a hip hop or Bollywood soundtrack on a commercial is not enough, we still have some way to go. </p> <p>Interest in the brown pound has never been higher, and with 32 billion reasons to get it right they can't afford mistakes.</p>",
  "<p>The defunct state reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, is a cold and imposing place, one part cathedral to two parts Castle Frankenstein. A vast monolith whose gothic arches resemble a house of both worship and horror, the building seems tailor-made to combine the fortressed needs of a prison with the spiritual ministrations of a church - a unique blend of punishment and salvation. It was here, in the early Nineties, that writer / director Frank Darabont filmed The Shawshank Redemption, a powerful parable of a wrongly convicted man who triumphs over terrible adversity, shedding his shackles to escape into dreams of the movies, spiritually liberating his fellow inmates in the process. And it was here, several years later, that I came looking for an answer to a question which has baffled many cynical film critics: how did a low-key prison drama, which was considered a box-office flop on its initial release, become one of the most popular movies of all time? </p> <p>Like most who reviewed The Shawshank Redemption when it was first released in 1994, I was impressed, but I had no idea just how important the film would become to some audiences. Certainly, I couldn't predict that in a few years' time it would be voted Best Film of the Nineties and Fourth Best Film of all time by the readers of Empire magazine; that it would rival The Godfather and Star Wars for the top spot of the Internet Movie Database subscribers' poll; or that it would be quoted on national television by (of all people) Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, who had apparently taken comfort in its message of redemption. </p> <p>Now on the eve of a tenth anniversary re-release, the film is widely considered a feelgood masterpiece to rank alongside Casablanca and It's A Wonderful Life as a perrenial audience favourite. So when, in 2001, Channel 4 asked the director Andrew Abbott and myself to make a documentary about The Shawshank Redemption, it was to this extraordinary audience reaction that we turned. What we found, particularly in America, was fans who were having what can only be described as a 'religious experience' with the film, who likened The Shawshank Redemption to a latter-day retelling of the story of the Gospels. </p> <p>One fan we met was a former inmate of Mansfield Reformatory who had renounced a life of drugs and crime to become a trainee pastor, and who considered The Shawshank Redemption to be a touchstone text on his road to salvation. Many others were just regular folk who had endured tough times in their lives, and who found an uplifting message in the story of one man's refusal to abandon hope in the most apparently hopeless situation. As the film's star, Tim Robbins, told me: 'It's a film about people being in jail, and having the hope to get out. Why is that universal? Because although not everybody has been in jail, on a deeper, more metaphysical level, many people feel enslaved by their environment, their jobs, their relationships - by whatever it is in the course of their lives that puts walls and bars around them. And Shawshank is a story about enduring and ultimately escaping from that imprisonment.' </p> <p> The Shawshank Redemption began life as a short story by horror guru Stephen King, published in the Different Seasons anthology which also included The Body, filmed by Rob Reiner as Stand By Me. A departure from scary fare such as Carrie and The Shining, the story, entitled Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption was described by King as 'a prison-break story in the grainy old Warner Brothers / Jimmy Cagney mould', which caught the attention of aspiring film-maker Darabont. Having made an early short film based on another King story, The Woman in the Room, Darabont had since been racking up screenwriting credits on such second-rate horror fare as the remake of The Blob and the sequel to the remake of The Fly. Now he was facing the prospect of making his directorial debut with 'a Chucky-type shocker' about which he was less than enthusiastic. Eager to attempt something more artistically ambitious, Darabont set to work on an adaptation of Shawshank, crafting a screenplay which was low on action, big on characterisation, and unfashionably lacking in car chases, romance, or explosive special effects. The resulting script, which Darabont was determined to direct himself, soon became a 'hot property', attracting the attention of such A-list stars as Nic Cage and Tom Cruise. Ultimately, Tim Robbins landed the key role of new Shawshank inmate Andy Dufresne, while Morgan Freeman was cast as old lag Red, a character originally written as a gruff white Irishman. (When asked why he's called Red, Freeman wryly replies: 'Maybe it's because I'm Irish' - a gag which accentuates the film's admirable colour blindness.) </p> <p>In 1994, The Shawshank Redemption garnered little public attention despite some glowing reviews. On its first-run American release, it recouped only $18 million of its $35m investment - this at a time when 'blockbusters' were regularly raking in more than $100m. Not even seven Oscar nominations could help it compete with the success of hits such as Speed, Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump. 'I don't know what happened when it first came out,' Morgan Freeman later admitted. 'In fact I remember someone asking me on the night of the Academy Awards why I thought Shawshank had done so poorly at box-office when films like Dumb and Dumber, which opened the same season, had done so well. After all, Shawshank had got pretty good reviews, whereas Dumb and Dumber had been thoroughly and relentlessly trashed by critics.' Theories offered in defence of Shawshank's box-office failure ranged from the incomprehensibility of the title (Robbins recalls fans asking 'What was that Shinkshonk Reduction thing?') to the unpopularity of 'prison movies' and the lack of any female characters to widen the audience demographic. According to Hollywood marketing law, Shawshank was a film tailor-made to fail, and it did just that - at least in cinemas. </p> <p>On video, however, it was a different story. Despite its disappointing box office turn-out, Warners shipped 320,000 rental copies of The Shawshank Redemption in the US, a figure which they happily admit was 'kinda outta whack' with its poor performance in cinemas. Not only would Shawshank become one of the top renting tapes of 1995, its subsequent TV airings would continue to pull in viewers in record-breaking numbers. Against all industry expectations, a film which had, in effect, been rejected by audiences in cinemas was rapidly shaping up as a home-viewing hit with both men and women. So what was happening? Ask any video dealer and they'll tell you that the key factor in Shawshank 's unexpected success on tape was simply word of mouth. Renters who had given the film a wide berth in cinemas were now taking The Shawshank Redemption home on the recommendation of friends and family, increasing numbers of whom were having profound, even life-changing, experiences with the movie. Repeat viewing was a big factor, too, with fans coming back to rent the same film time and time again, developing an intense personal relationship with the themes and characters in the comfort of their own home. </p> <p>The intimacy of the home-viewing experience seems to have been of crucial importance for The Shawshank Redemption. As Darabont attests 'I've gotten mail from people who say: \"Gosh, your movie got me through a really bad marriage,\" you know, or \"a really bad divorce\". Or \"it got me through a really bad patch in my life\" \"a really bad illness\" or \"it helped me hang on when a loved one died\".' </p> <p>One viewer described their tape of The Shawshank Redemption as 'like a friend in the sitting-room, who talked to me and picked me up when I was down'. And from such intimate encounters came the quasi-religious readings which would transform The Shawshank Redemption into a latter-day Gospel for some viewers. David Bruce, of the 'spiritual' pop culture website HollywoodJesus.com observes: 'It's an example of film as therapy. The Shawshank Redemption gives you hope; you can go on; you can go forward.' </p> <p>For those who want to find them, there are indeed ample religious motifs woven into the fabric of The Shawshank Redemption. Some are deliberate and darkly ironic - none more so than the character of Warden Norton, described in King's text as a 'Jesus-shouting son of a whore', and played by Bob Gunton as a scripture-quoting demon closer to Richard Nixon than Billy Graham. 'I believe in two things,' Norton tells the 'new fish', Andy, 'Discipline and the Bible. Here you will receive both. Put your trust in the Lord - your ass belongs to me.' </p> <p>Elsewhere, the symbolism is implied rather than announced, with the falsely convicted Andy resembling a latter-day Christ figure who, at one point, seems to vanish from his tomb-like cell only to be reborn in the baptismal waters of a nearby creek, causing Norton to scream: 'Lord, it's a miracle!' And of course, the most famously iconic image from the film is that of a stripped Andy standing with his arms outstretched, his head turned heavenward, in a moment of agony and ecstasy clearly resembling the crucifixion. </p> <p>The deeper one delves into The Shawshank Redemption, however, the more the search for such religious symbols becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. While immersed in writing a short book about the movie for the British Film Institute's 'Modern Classics' series last year, I suddenly noticed an 'obvious' parallel between a key scene in which Andy procures beers for twelve fellow inmates which made them feel like 'the Lords of all creation' and the legend of the Last Supper in which Jesus hands wine to his disciples with the promise of eternal life. When my manuscript was finished, I sent a copy to Darabont who expressed his delight at my 'beer communion' reading, but insisted that no such interpretation had ever occurred to him. 'But isn't that the point?' he wrote. 'That people should find their own meanings in the film. The more the merrier; bring them on.' </p> <p>For Tim Robbins, the true significance of The Shawshank Redemption has nothing to do with religion, but resides in the fact that 'it's a film in which you actually see a relationship between two men which isn't based on car chases, or scoring some women, or some kind of caper'. Morgan Freeman concurs, adding that the story of Andy and Red is the story of 'a sort of love relationship' which goes 'deeper than just friendship. But to tell you the truth, I just don't know what it is about that film that resonates so with people.' </p> <p>'All I know,' concludes Robbins 'is that there isn't a day when I'm not approached about that film - approached by people who say how important that film is to them, who tell me that they've seen it 20, 30, 40 times, and who are just so... thankful.' </p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong> The Shawshank Redemption by Mark Kermode is published by BFI Modern Classics.

  "<p>Auteur, occultist and Hollywood scandal-spreader Kenneth Anger is a famously irascible old man. Within minutes of our first meeting, I can sense a storm simmering. We're having lunch in the quiet corner booth of a bistro in Los Feliz, LA, and he's telling a particularly juicy Hollywood story about an A-list actor who began his career as a rent boy.</p> <p>'He was nothing but a 17-year-old hustler, and a stupid one at that,' he scoffs, Jackson Pollocking my face with egg salad. 'He contracted gonorrhoea and he must have given it to dozens of people because he didn't have it seen to for weeks. It got so bad ... 'On an adjacent table, a bubbly young woman begins guffawing noisily with her boyfriend. Anger seethes and leans closer into my tape recorder. 'It got so bad,' he repeats, shooting her a vicious glare, 'that he literally had pus dripping through his pants. Oh for God's sake...'</p> <p>Now she's laughing her head off. Her face is red and shuddering, she's hooting and banging the table. And with her every burst, Anger's fury mounts - he winces, his jaw clenches ever tighter, until finally he snaps. 'Right, I'm going to tell that fucking bitch to shut up!' And he squeezes out of the booth, this tall and fuming 75-year-old, half-dragging the tablecloth with him. He stomps over to her table and barks: 'Do you think you could possibly keep it down?' The glee drains swiftly from the poor girl's face. 'I'm trying to do an interview over there and I can barely hear myself think! You really are very loud, you know, you have a very shrill voice. In fact,' he jabs his finger at her, 'you have the ugliest voice I've ever heard in a woman!'</p> <p>With that, he returns to his salad, his breath shaking, and tucks himself back in. 'That told her. The bitch. Now, she's made me forget what we were talking about. Oh yes, gonorrhoea. So, anyway, by the time he had it treated his tubes were terribly scarred...' And that is legally where his anecdote must end. To name the star in question would invite a ruinous libel suit.</p> <p>Though he gives the appearance at times of just an ill-tempered peddler of unsubstantiated gossip, Kenneth Anger is in fact an artist whose influence on modern culture has been immense. As the author of the iconic Hollywood Babylon books (volumes I and II), Anger not only swung open the gates to a world of gossip in which our media now wallows, he coined a title so classic that, like Catch 22, you needn't have read it to understand what it means. The venereal A-list rent boy has all the hallmarks of a vintage Babylon tale - a huge star with a sleazy secret, lashings of Schadenfreude and the graphic relish of 'dripping pus', a typical Anger flourish. But Anger is firstly a filmmaker, one of the most important of the 20th century - gossip was only ever a sideline. Throughout his career he broke momentous ground with his short art films, pioneering both gay cinema and MTV in turn, a 'trashy channel' he can now hardly bear to watch. A leading light in the American underground, alongside Stan Brakhage and Bruce Conner, Anger was the first to use pop songs instead of a traditional score for his films. His use of jump cuts and sound were a huge influence on music videos and commercials. Martin Scorsese described him as 'a unique filmmaker, an artist of exceptional imagination'. And yet his life's work of nine short films amounts to little more than three hours of celluloid. After almost two decades of near obscurity, however, this year is shaping up to be something of a resurgence for Anger. He has at least three films in the pipeline - about cricket; the recent suicide of the musician Elliott Smith; and Aleister Crowley's The Gnostic Mass, in turn. Anger is an accomplished occultist; his films are laden with myth and symbol. He is such an authority on Crowley that he recently completed a documentary about him for Italian television. And on 2 September, Modern Art, a gallery in Shoreditch, east London, will show an exhibition of stills from his 1969 film, Invocation of My Demon Brother.</p> <p>'Anger has been a huge inspiration,' says the London-based film installation artist, Isaac Julien. 'His films are meditative in the poetical, aesthetic sense. They really developed the vocabulary for the new queer cinema in the early Nineties.' Louise Wilson, of the sibling collaborators Jane and Louise Wilson, is simply 'in awe' of Anger's work: 'It's always a shock to look at the dates of his work - he was always so far ahead of his time.' Doug Aitken, who exhibited at Victoria Miro gallery last November, is similarly dazzled: 'It's ironic that you have an individual coming out of the left and yet his influence becomes this mainstream language of popular media,' he says. 'Without Stan Brakhage, Bruce Conner and Anger, you wouldn't have the popular media of today - the colourisation, the jump cuts, the fetishisation of objects.'</p> <p>Anger's films are short, imagistic 'pieces of art', a far cry from traditional three-act dramas. Rich in occult symbols and devoid of dialogue, they hark back to the silent era while using techniques that herald the future. 'They're like sketches on a piece of paper,' he says. 'I wanted to show that you can make films of merit without huge amounts of money.' He made his first film at the age of 17, over a weekend, using a borrowed camera. The 15-minute Fireworks shows a dream about the rape of a teenage boy (played by Anger) by a group of American sailors. It's shocking by any standard, but for 1947, when gay cinema had scarcely been conceived, and American sailors had just returned home as war heroes, it was revolutionary. Jean Cocteau declared that Fireworks came from 'that beautiful night from which emerge all true works' and he promptly invited Anger to France. And for much of his twenties, the young Anger was literally the darling of the European avant-garde - hobnobbing with the likes of John Paul Getty II and Federico Fellini. </p> <p>But the money ran out. So he wrote a book of scandal, and fittingly, his first publisher was Jean-Jacques Pauvert, the publisher of the Marquis de Sade. Weaving in the juiciest stories from pre-talkie Hollywood up to the Manson murders, Hollywood Babylon describes a Gomorrah where stars plummet as well as rise on the back of idol worship. With a wicked wit, Anger recalls Valentino's taste for submissive sex, Chaplin's misdemeanours with underage girls and a handful of starlet suicides, each one offset by a wickedly ironic choice of photographs. The New York Times called it 'a delicious box of poisoned bonbons'.</p> <p>Typically, Anger was years ahead of his time. The first version of Babylon came out in 1959, in France, although disputes with his publisher meant that it took until 1975 for the English version to come out and become an international sensation. 'The timing was interesting,' says Jeannette Walls, a gossip columnist for Msnbc.com, a news and entertainment website. 'Post-Watergate there was a fascination with tearing down American icons, and the breakdown of the studio system made Hollywood figures fair game. The fascination with Hollywood had gone into a coma, and Hollywood Babylon helped revive it. Kenneth Anger opened a Pandora's box.'</p> <p>At first, Anger was dogged by copyright problems. When he returned to California in the Sixties, he struggled to prevent bootleggers from cashing in on Babylon. But he continued to break new ground in film. Scorpio Rising (1964) not only introduced the gay-biker archetype (unbeknown to the apparently heterosexual Bruce Byron, who played Scorpio), it also led to a landmark victory in the State Supreme Court over 'permissible nudity' in film. 'For me, Scorpio is his most important film,' says Doug Aitken. 'It has such a peculiar feeling to it, these fetishised shots of bikes. It's the film that Ballard would have made 10 years before he wrote Crash.' </p> <p>Most significantly, however, Scorpio was the first film to substitute a pop music soundtrack for a score, a decade before George Lucas's American Graffiti. David Lynch was evidently moved by Anger's juxtaposition of dandy bikers and Bobby Vinton's 'Blue Velvet'. Scorsese, again, credits Anger's musical innovation for the soundtrack of Mean Streets. 'Well, at least he credits me,' Anger says, with a shrug. 'I've seen my shot sequences copied time and again on MTV. I wish they would hire me for something instead of just stealing my ideas. I mean, I could do with the work.' The film that inspires the exhibition at Modern Art, Invocation of My Demon Brother, seems designed to create anxiety. It teems with occult symbols and features a grinding one-note dirge for a soundtrack, performed by Mick Jagger on a Moog synthesiser. The Rolling Stones were close associates of Anger. He claims his influence gave rise to the song 'Sympathy For The Devil'.</p> <p>Louise Wilson senses in the film 'an incredible menace, it's physically unsettling to watch. You can tell this is a time of LSD, that there's a war going on, that bad things are happening. I see it as a brilliant protest against Vietnam.'</p> <p>'Invocation is his most intimidating film,' says Walter Cassidy, the curator of the exhibition. 'All of his films stand up to closer inspection, but Invocation was made like a spell. Kenneth crafts his films like an artisan, frame by frame, and there are so many flash images that appear for only two frames - when you think that film works at 24 frames per second, that's almost subliminal.' Cassidy has blown up a selection of these images for the exhibition, some of which recall the sombre Rolling Stones concert in Hyde Park in July 1969, two days after Brian Jones died. When I mention this concert to Anger, he rolls his eyes: 'Yes, that was a disastrous concert. Thousands of white butterflies died for no reason. They were going to release them but they all died from the heat. I said to Mick Jagger, \"They're not just a cheap prop, you know.\" He said, \"I know, they cost $1,000.\"'</p> <p>Invocation grew out of footage originally intended for Anger's occult tour de force, Lucifer Rising, a film he began in 1969 but took until 1981 to complete. It features Marianne Faithfull as Lilith, the kabbalistic goddess of destruction, in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, and Donald Cammell, the director of Performance (1970), as Osiris, the Lord of Death. Anger had persuaded an 18-year-old musician, Bobby BeauSoleil, to create the film's soundtrack, but then 1,500ft of shot film and camera equipment went missing, and Anger accused BeauSoleil of robbing him. BeauSoleil, who had connections to the Manson family, was then caught up in a murder and sentenced to life in prison. Anger claims to have persuaded Jimmy Page, a fellow Crowley enthusiast, to perform the soundtrack in BeauSoleil's place, but Page didn't deliver, so years later Anger arranged for BeauSoleil to record the soundtrack with a band he had formed in prison. Lucifer Rising is still the only film soundtrack ever to have been recorded in jail. </p> <p>Ever since 1981, however, Anger has been remarkably quiet. He made a brief anti-smoking short in 2000 called simply Don't Smoke That Cigarette (Anger loathes cigarettes) and in 2002 a documentary about Aleister Crowley, called The Man We Want To Hang. It's hardly a prolific turnover in 23 years, which explains his excitement over his next film, which he hopes to begin in September when he next visits 'that cancerous area known as Greater London. The air there is unbreathable.' Over the last few months, he has been preparing for a film about cricket - a 59-minute 'ballet' entitled an Arrangement of White on Green, in tribute to the paintings of James Whistler. He has planned it meticulously. The soundtrack is secured, the poster designed, but then his patron, the late Sir John Paul Getty II, passed away last year, and now Anger is unsure whether the film is a 'go' or not. It's odd that, for so long, Kenneth Anger should have struggled to get a gig: after all, the likes of Dennis Hopper, Ana\u00efs Nin and the Stones were close friends, though he now describes the latter as 'a ragtag band of senior citizens'. Only Keith Richards comes away without a savaging - Anger concedes he was 'nice'. As for Anita Pallenberg, however, Anger told me that 'she thought she was a witch, but she was just a bitch, if you ask me'. Yet Pallenberg is scheduled to host the reception for Anger's exhibition in September.</p> <p>In an effort to lighten him up, I suggest we take a walk through the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. It's one of his favourite haunts, full of the tombs of celebrities past - much of the cast, in fact, of Hollywood Babylon - and as we wander about the palm trees and the springy lawns, Anger dispenses canape scandalettes about who was murdered or raped, who took an overdose and so on. 'You know Paramount,' he says, pointing to the studio that abuts the graveyard. 'They built the studio right over the tombs of the first pioneers. They didn't remove the bodies.' </p> <p>We pause reverently at the tombs of Douglas Fairbanks and Valentino, with whom he's particularly smitten, and discuss acid, Armenians and how to invoke the storm demon, alighting inevitably on the war in Iraq, erstwhile seat of the Kingdom of Babylon but now, 'a hideous little country, like a Pekinese nipping at America's heels. We're in the new Dark Ages with all these beheadings,' he muses. 'Pretty soon, beheadings will become rather ho-hum and some new horror will emerge. Like eye gouging.' Anger abhors the 'cry-baby liberals' of Hollywood, particularly one A-list actress who, he says, threatened to burn her American passport and declare herself a citizen of Iraq backstage at the 2003 Oscars. 'Perhaps I'll include that story in Hollywood Babylon III.' </p> <p>With the former rent-boy actor and the closet-Iraqi actress, Hollywood Babylon III is sure to cause an enormous fuss when it comes out. Sadly, that day may never come. For over a year, the manuscript has been gathering dust on the desk of Anger's publisher, since in its present form it would unleash a blizzard of litigation. 'I no longer conceal my contempt for Hollywood,' he says, 'and I'm no longer amused by it. I was genuinely fond of some of the stars in the first two [books]. I'm no longer fond of anybody in Hollywood. So I indulge in the luxury of hating them.' </p> <p>True to his word, in one diatribe he expresses a loathing for Julianne Moore ('she's an airhead'), Meryl Streep ('an old sourpuss'), Johnny Depp ('an actor I hate') and John Travolta ('box-office poison') - not to mention Jack Nicholson, Julia Roberts, Nicolas Cage, Tom Cruise and the late Marlon Brando, all of whom are slandered mercilessly. Most worrying for the publisher is Anger's assault on Scientology. 'Getting sued by Scientologists is like getting pecked to death by ducks,' he says. But he wades in regardless. Anger was good friends with a now-deceased Crowleyite scientist whom he feels was viciously betrayed by Scientology's founder, L Ron Hubbard, so Babylon III is Anger's revenge. Ominously, however, the editors at EP Dutton claim to know nothing of such a manuscript. </p> <p>'Look,' he says, exasperated, 'I just don't give a fuck any more. Maybe I'll publish the first edition in Germany, where libel laws are more lenient. Failing that, I'll self-publish. I just don't know.'</p> <p>In some ways, Anger is like a caricature codger who is sent misty by the pictures he grew up with, but left cold by this modern nonsense. He doesn't go to the cinema any more, 'because I object to being deafened'. He doesn't watch television - 'I call it the vampire of time.' Yet for all his bluster and eccentricity, he is also a tragic figure - an artist whose influence on the mainstream has been huge, and yet he is isolated, vulnerable and struggling for money now in his old age. Though he claims that he still receives publishing royalties, he has precious few belongings beyond his books and photographs. He puts a brave face on his penury, but last year he became effectively homeless and now rents a tiny place in Echo Park, behind a chicken wire gate, surrounded by gang violence. </p> <p>No filmmaker of Anger's edge and attitude would ever be found riding around a Florida golf course in a buggy, but he seems hardly at peace with his lot. He won't allow me to see his home. He took a bus to the restaurant, today, rather than let me pick him up. For all the expos\u00e9s he has written about others, he remains acutely sensitive about his own secrets. He lives alone - 'I've always been a loner' - and is a chronic insomniac: 'I tune my radio to the BBC World Service,' he says. 'I can't dream, but at least I can listen to the nightmares of the real world.'</p> <p>Perhaps if Anger lived in Europe, where he once prospered, life would be easier. 'Hollywood is the wrong place for him,' says Louise Wilson. 'It's legendary for people stealing your ideas. And just mention the occult and they'll pull your funding.' But his situation is not helped by financial irresponsibility. Last year, the San Francisco Film Arts Foundation awarded him a cheque for $7,000, which would have covered his year's rent. Instead, he threw a lavish party and blew the lot in a night, even tipping the taxi driver $100.</p> <p>What would a young Anger have made of the man before me? His story seems to amply qualify for Hollywood Babylon III. He was a brilliant young filmmaker, a pioneer and visionary who suffered nevertheless 'a cemetery of abortions'. Naturally, Anger denies any resonance between his story and those of his books - 'I never made a Hollywood movie and I never had enough money to live the life.' But what of the occultist who decried Hollywood amorality while his own courtroom victories kicked open the door for pornographers, ushering Babylon in? Or the artist who earnt his keep from books of scandal? And most of all, a man who, as a teen, changed his name from Anglemyer to Anger, only to find that his temper may have been his undoing? Why did he change his name all those years ago? Does he think it has worked like a spell?</p> <p>'You're being impertinent,' he says, irritated. </p> <p>'It says Anger on my passport, that's all you need to know.' Anger's eyes thin and he peers suspiciously at me. 'I would stay away from that subject if I was you.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> New editioned films stills by Kenneth Anger will be on show from 2 September-10 October at Modern Art, 10 Vyner Street, London E2; 020 8980 7742.

  "<p>If you didn't see Nadia Almada coming, you would definitely hear her. That amazing signature laugh (half witch's cackle, half fire alarm) is already cascading down the stairs as I make my way up into a West London bar to meet this year's Big Brother winner. The former bank clerk from Woking and Portuguese transgender woman is having her photograph taken, very much in her element, posing and chatting among the fragile soapy globes thrown out by a child's bubble machine. </p> <p>Once the photographs are over, Nadia sits with me and smokes just as she did in the Big Brother house - brilliantly and continuously, as if she were a starlet auditioning for a role in an art-house movie. This is her first interview with a newspaper since her win: Nadia surprised everybody by not selling her story to a tabloid ('I wanted to be in control a bit, a little more private'). In person, she turns out to be as lovely, honest, defiant and vulnerable as she was when she was winning over the viewers in the Big Brother house, showering in her high heels, screaming for cigarettes and fretting about her 'secret' in the diary room. She is pretty, too, very radiant and glamorous. Looking at her, you think again of how unfair (not to mention ungallant) it was of housemate, Victor, to describe her as 'Antonio Banderas with boobs on'. </p> <p>Now into the second week of her new-found celebrity, Nadia reveals that she's still very much on a high. 'I haven't grasped it yet,' she smiles. 'I haven't stopped and said \"That's me!\" on TV and covers of magazines, or grasped being stopped by people in the street.' Has she ever felt pestered? 'Not at all. If it was negative stuff, you'd think, \"Oh no!\", but it is all \"I voted for you\", \"I loved you\". To hear such comments, who could ask for more? I should enjoy it,\" Nadia grins sagely. 'Next week, next month, whatever, this is all going to fade away.' </p> <p>Nadia's emergence from the Big Brother house with four million votes (74 per cent of the total) was one of the unexpected TV highlights of the year. What could have so easily become an exploitative freak show turned into something genuinely moving: her euphoria at being validated and accepted; the crowd's euphoria at her euphoria. For once, there seemed to be a harmonious sense of yin and yang between the public and an instant celebrity. 'I felt so flattered,' says Nadia. 'I still do. I could die tomorrow and be a very happy person. I just feel so comfortable and if you'd seen me six months ago, I wouldn't have been comfortable at all, with pictures of me as I was before, or anything.' Nadia lights a cigarette thoughtfully. ' Big Brother changed me. It really changed me.' </p> <p>It wouldn't be too wild a claim to say that Nadia has single-handedly 'saved' the Big Brother franchise. She certainly revitalised it, giving it a much broader and deeper emotional appeal. Big Brother 2003, when 'Cameron the Christian' won, was an acknowledged flop. This year, the makers, Endemol, pulled out all the stops, delivering 'evil' Big Brother. They were rewarded with nude lawn-mowing, bitterly polarised cliques, sex under a table, and a fight so bad the show was taken off the air temporarily, not to mention the customary newspaper headlines screaming about exploitation and the moral decline of the nation. Whether you loved it or loathed it, or did both at once, no one could deny that Big Brother was on form again. </p> <p>However, it took Nadia to turn Big Brother into a cultural barometer. Finally, among the endless catwalk of wannabes, here was someone with a real story to tell. Whereas the series has long abandoned any pretence at being a 'social experiment', she used her time in the house to conduct an experiment all of her own: that of being accepted as a woman in her own right. While the viewers knew about Nadia's past, her fellow housemates didn't, leading to scenes of almost unbearable pathos amid the mud, jam and rumpus: Nadia's confessionals in the diary room; the heartbreaking way she froze on the sofa when her housemates starting taking about transgender; those excited, terrified tears as she was dancing to 'La Isla Bonita' in the final week. </p> <p>On a wider level, the triumph of a Portuguese transgender woman in the nation's greatest unofficial popularity contest threw up important questions about Britain today: Are attitudes shifting? Is there a greater tolerance and broadmindedness, at least among the nation's youth? Or is it unwise to attach too much sociological significance to a moment floating out from reality television's own bubble machine, perhaps doomed to pop and splatter as it hit genuine reality? </p> <p>Phil Edgar-Jones, executive producer at Endemol, admits to being 'thrilled and pleasantly surprised' by Nadia's win. 'We never expected when we put the housemates in that a Portuguese transgender woman would end up winning.' He points out that there was a very similar fuss when Brian Dowling became the first gay man to win Big Brother in 2001, and that Nadia was not the first transgender person to apply to Big Brother: 'What we liked about Nadia was that she wasn't so much on a political journey as a personal journey. We found that intriguing. It was a bit like a soap opera wasn't it? She knew, we knew, but they didn't.' </p> <p>Edgar-Jones adds that the fact Nadia won probably had much more to do with her personality than anything else, a sentiment echoed by Mark Frith, editor of Heat, the 'self-appointed Big Brother magazine'. Nadia gave Heat her first interview out of the house, and is in the process of being rewarded with a record four covers in row. 'Our readers adore her,' says Frith. 'Yes, she's been on this journey, yes, it's all very serious. But there's this other side to her that's all about this incredibly infectious laugh and how entertaining she is. Considering what she'd been through, it was even more admirable that she was kicking back and having the time of her life, putting the hose-pipe over her head and singing \"It's Raining Men\".' </p> <p>Transgender groups, representing 5000 people in the UK alone, have also been quick to praise Nadia. 'She's gone her own way about being accepted as a woman,' says Leanne Fuller of The Gender Trust, the UK charity for transgender people. 'She has taken the public eye not in a form of sympathy but in a form of empathy.' Christine Bond, author and lobbyist for transgender group, Press for Change, agrees: 'Nadia's most valuable contribution was that she's put a face and personality to people's stereotyped ideas about transsexual people. Her big personality means that people focused on Nadia as a person without considering her medical history.' </p> <p>However, Bond does sound a note of caution. After a 12-year battle, the British transgender community won major legal rights this year, including the right to marry and change their birth certificates and passports, but this won't necessarily heal all wounds. 'Nadia has shown herself to be very vulnerable,' says Bond. 'She will need some time to digest this experience. She would have expected until quite late in the day that people would reject her because that unfortunately is the received experience of all transgender people.' Indeed, Nadia tells me that she never expected to win. 'I'd created barriers in my own mind that people would not give me a second chance or second glance because of my past. Coming from where I came from, after what I'd been through, I expected the worst; I was prepared for the worst. I was so happy to be proved wrong.' </p> <p>Nadia was born Jorge Almada on Madeira 27 years ago, the eldest of six sons to father, Jose Luis, and mother, Conceicao. When she was 11, the family emigrated to South Africa. Nadia was unhappy there. Her father's alcohol problem meant he worked erratically and Nadia, as the eldest, had to work and help care for her brothers with her mother, missing a lot of school in the process. When Nadia was 16, Conceicao left Jose Luis and took the children back to Madeira. Her father has since told the press that he had always wanted a daughter and now God had given him one. 'He was kind enough to say that', says Nadia. 'But it does not change what he made us go through. I've forgiven my father but I will never forget.' </p> <p>Back in Madeira, Nadia battled with continuing feelings that something 'wasn't right. I always felt I was different to my brothers and the \"little boy\" stereotypes.' At the age of five her father caught her using nail polish and slapped her. Hitting puberty, she became more confused. 'It was frightening because I didn't understand it. I felt I was weird, a freak; an abnormal person.' She was, she says with a chuckle, 'very feminine', doing her hair, plucking her eyebrows, putting on make-up. Her gregarious personality meant she had a lot of friends but it was a quiet rural area. Men coming into the bar would be threatened by her femininity, and there was inevitable criticism and bullying from those around her. </p> <p>Nadia was upset when her mother started getting criticism, but it still didn't deter her. 'The more people criticised me, the stronger I became. I said: \"If you want to behave like that, I'll behave like I am, and tough luck, you either like it or lump it\".' By now, Nadia assumed she was gay: 'just because I was attracted to men. I didn't know any different. Obviously I could relate to the tag of being gay.' As Jorge she had a few sexual experiences. 'I thought it was the right thing to do, but I wasn't happy, it wasn't right. I wanted to be with men but I didn't want them to see me as one. Men were attracted to me because they were gay, they were attracted to me for my genitalia, but I wanted to be with a man who saw me as a woman.' </p> <p>At 19, Nadia followed her friends to Woking, but it was only during a stint working in Brighton that she felt comfortable enough to begin the process of transition, living publicly as a woman. A sympathetic GP back in Woking paved the way, and she began taking hormone tablets. Nadia being Nadia, she lost no time in getting her breasts surgically enhanced from a B to a DD cup. ('I wanted more!'), but she admits she found life difficult in the early stages. 'I went through a dark stage after I started taking the hormones. I had the mood swings, I put on weight; I couldn't stand looking at myself in the mirror. And again no relationships; I couldn't face it. They would have been attracted to something (she grimaces slightly) different and I wanted them to be attracted to me as a woman.' </p> <p>Nadia wasn't nervous about the actual operation: 'I couldn't wait. I was always on the phone: \"When is this happening? Can you bring the date forward?\" I was pestering all the time. I was like a stalker.' She says when she woke up afterwards she felt 'complete' for the first time. 'My body was in pain but my heart was so happy. I felt reborn again. If you ask my friends, the person I was before, in energy and excitement and happiness, there's no comparison. I never looked back.' Her eyes flash. 'And I never will, believe me.' </p> <p>A few months after the surgery, Nadia joined the Big Brother house. Wasn't this too soon? A motorway pile-up of life-changing experiences? Nadia insists it couldn't have come too soon for her: 'I wanted to have some fun! Don't forget, I'd wasted the best years of my life: my teenage years, my early twenties, watching my friends and cousins having relationships, holding hands, all that, I lost all that because of what happened to me.' Later, in a rare 'down' moment, Nadia says softly that sometimes she wants to take 'a big eraser' and rub out all the years that have gone before. 'I just wish I'd been born normal, a normal straight woman, so I didn't have to go through the things I went through, and the people around me have been through as well.' That's why, after the operation, Nadia didn't want to waste a single moment. Indeed, she says her prime motive for going into the Big Brother house was to have fun and meet new people. 'I wanted to enjoy it, embrace the world! I didn't want to sit around and have deep conversations or anything like that.' </p> <p>I need this seems to be the key to Nadia, the time she believes she's 'lost' and her corresponding sense of urgency, coupled with a pragmatic view of what life might have to offer. Nadia signed to John Noel Management after her win, and is currently inundated with offers, ranging from magazines and radio to music and TV (she certainly won't be going back to being a bank clerk). However, she seems to have a very grounded take on her celebrity, which must make her the first-ever realistic reality TV show winner. 'I know how superficial this industry is,' she shrugs. 'One day, you're the hero; the next day no one wants to know you. If people wish to consider me a celebrity I'm very flattered but I don't really think I'm worthy. I took part in an experience and had an amazing response and I'm quite content with that.' It helps that she has lifelong friends around her, as well as the support of her family, including her mother who was there to greet her when she came out of the house. </p> <p>A long-time Big Brother fan, Nadia says she didn't find any part of her stay particularly stressful ('Apart from having no cigarettes, hahaha'), even though she wasn't popular with all of her housemates (part of the fun this year was observing the stand-offs between Nadia's 'lip-gloss bitches' and the incredulous hetero boys). She also pours scorn on ex-contestants who claim the show ruined their lives. 'Pooh!', she cries. 'Nonsense! They made their choice to go in the house. After the first year, the consequences were there for all to see.' On the other hand, it becomes clear during our conversation that, while Nadia is delighted with the positive reaction of the transgender community ('I'm glad if I can educate people about my experiences'), she doesn't like being constantly reminded about it, or for that matter defined by it. </p> <p>'I don't want to tick a box and say I'm transgender. I don't understand why people want to categorise themselves like that.' She sees it as another prison? 'Exactly. Rather than consider themselves transgender they should just let their personalities shine. We are women, I am a woman. If you want to get into that, you're going to be stuck most of the time talking about what you've been through, and that is the last thing I want.' She seems much happier speculating about her future 'Prince Charming' - either a Hugh Grant type ('that gentlemanly English thing') or 'Vin Diesel: A manly man, with a big physique, so he can give me a hug and I feel protected in his embrace.' </p> <p>Her ideal future would include an 'interesting career' and 'someone there with me, someone to share my happi ness and my sad moments as well,' she cackles, 'my stroppy moods and my diva demands!' Even when I press her, Nadia adamantly refuses to be concerned about future media intrusion, kiss and tells, or anything else from the dark side of celebrity - her attitude seems to be that people have already made their minds up whether they like her or not. In short, Nadia's attitude seems to be that she has undertaken her crash course in acceptance to prove herself as a woman, and that is that. 'It's my past, it was part of me, fair enough, goodbye!' </p> <p>As I prepared to take my leave, this was the only thing about Nadia that worried me. Although her positive attitude is magnificent (Nadia could teach us all a thing or two about living in the moment), you wonder how she will fare if and when the media honeymoon comes to an end. She has not only become a woman, she has become possibly the most famous woman in Britain, and as such her 'past' is bound to infect her present and her future. Moreover, while the public affection at the time of her win was clearly genuine, and (the mainly youthful) Big Brother audience is unlikely to be prejudiced, there was also a 'love-bombing' element that rang hollow. It was almost as if Britain was trying to prove something to itself about itself that wasn't quite true. </p> <p>In essence, they were cheering for Nadia, the colourful character, rather than Nadia the woman, which proves perversely that she won on the strength of her personality rather than any unusual aspects of her past. (Which makes sense: you could be a freshly arrived alien, with green and purple spots, but if you're boring, a Big Brother audience won't vote for you). Just as I am about to leave, it transpires the paparazzi are waiting outside. Is Nadia OK about that? Does she want them moved on? Nadia, cigarette in hand, merely narrows her eyes at all the fuss, shrugs and lets rip with one of her life-affirming, throat-exposing guffaws. I have the feeling the little lady will be all right. </p> <p><strong>Model, fashion adviser, TV presenter... what next for Nadia? We asked the experts</strong></p> <p><strong> Mark Borkowski</strong> Borkowski PR, arts promoters </p> <p>Nadia needs to be very careful with what she chooses to do now. She shouldn't take the easy route and fall into the 'Portu-geezer' role. There's an honesty and a passion to her and she has lots of options at the moment - London Fashion Week is coming up and a canny designer could use her as a model, and I think she could happily front a chat show. If Eurotrash needs a rebrand, she could front that or the Portuguese Tourist Authority could use her as a spokeswoman. </p> <p><strong> Annabel Robinson </strong>FMCM Associates, books PR</p> <p>Nadia has real character and this could mean longevity in the media. She's probably best placed to be a TV presenter and could maybe host her own talk show. She could also have a fashion column - she's very fashion-conscious so it could be like Nadia meets Sex in the City. If she wanted to write an autobiography it would have to be ghost-written. It would probably have a broad market - certainly women in their twenties and thirties and the gay audience. </p> <p><strong>Sarah Ivens</strong> Deputy Editor, OK! magazine </p> <p>She'd be fabulous in an OK! shoot. I think she's one of the most exciting people to come out of reality TV for a long time. She'd make a fabulous fashion adviser to other celebrities - her outfits were so glamorous. I can imagine she was a tough housemate - especially when she ran out of cigarettes, and so she'd be a great case study for Allen Carr if he managed to stop her smoking.

  "After six minutes of superhuman effort over 2,000 metres, Britain's rowers made Olympic history yesterday when they clinched gold by just six inches and eight-hundredths of a second in one of the most dramatic races ever seen. <p>Matthew Pinsent's usually calm demeanour dissolved when he burst into tears after entering the pantheon of British sporting legends by winning his fourth successive Olympic gold medal as part of the crew in the men's four that pipped their Canadian rivals on the line with an amazing last-gasp surge. </p> <p>Narrowly in front for the first 1,500m, the British quartet of Pinsent, James Cracknell, Steve Williams and Ed Coode was suddenly overtaken with 500m to go but recovered to steal victory in an amazing photo finish. </p> <p>Confusion reigned for 30 agonising seconds before officials confirmed Britain as the winners. Their winning time of six minutes and 6.98 seconds was just 0.08 seconds faster than the Canadians, the reigning world champions, whose time was 6:07:06. </p> <p>'When we crossed the bow balls, I didn't think we'd won,' said Pinsent, the team's stroke. 'It was so tight. They shouted over to us, \"Who won? Who won?\" Nobody knew. But then we saw all the Union Jacks go up on the left.' </p> <p>The team's early morning victory was the highlight of an extraordinary day which saw Britain achieve its biggest ever Olympic medal haul in a single day of competition. Yesterday Britain's rowers, sailors, cyclists and equestrian eventers between them won nine medals - four golds, three silvers and two bronzes - to take the country's medal tally to 17 so far. </p> <p>Sailor Ben Ainslie won his second Olympic gold when he triumphed in the Finn class; track cyclist and Observer columnist Bradley Wiggins did the same in the final of the men's individual pursuit, while equestrian rider Leslie Law found himself upgraded from a silver to a gold medal several days after he had competed when a British appeal against the original placings was upheld. </p> <p>Cath Bishop and Katherine Grainger won silver in rowing's women's pairs, while Nick Rogers and Jonathan Glanfield did the same in sailing's 470 class. Rowing provided a third medal when Sarah Winckless and Elise Laverick came third in the double sculls, while rider Pippa Funnell also benefited from Britain's equestrian appeal by moving up from fourth to the bronze medal position, a decision that also saw Britain's team bronze upgraded to silver. </p> <p>But all eyes were on the rowing earlier in the day. The several thousand British supporters among the 11,000-strong crowd at the Schinias Rowing Centre on the outskirts of Athens erupted. They had watched the quartet go ahead, lead by a foot, then fall behind by half a second with the finishing line looming. But a huge push over the last 40 strokes ensured the tightest of victories - by six inches, Pinsent reckoned. </p> <p>It was an astonishing achievement for a crew that has suffered nine changes of personnel in recent months, only becoming settled in early July and which has been beset by injury. Pinsent suffered a bout of tonsillitis and Cracknell - one of the quartet alongside Sir Steve Redgrave and Pinsent who won the same event in the Sydney Olympics in 2000 - fractured a rib in May. </p> <p>Dan Humphreys of National Lottery operators Camelot, who sponsor the team, said: 'During the brief confusion at the end people around me were saying \"Don't celebrate yet,\" but I was sure they'd won. It might have looked close on television, but to me they clearly finished first. </p> <p>'It was an incredible experience to be there and see them do it in the flesh. Having watched them up close for the past year, and seen all the problems they've had with selection and injuries, to see that end with a gold medal was very special.' </p> <p>Pinsent hinted that yesterday's heroics may lead to retirement. 'Of course this result is going to influence it,' he said. He is carving out an alternative career as a member of the International Olympic Committee. </p> <p>Kelly Sotherton was on course to win Britain's first track and field medal of these Olympics by taking the silver in the heptathlon, although defending champion Denise Lewis pulled out injured after five events. </p> <p>Paula Radcliffe is expected to continue Britain's golden streak today when she runs in the women's marathon, from historic Marathon into central Athens. British competitors are also hoping to secure more medals in the next few days in athletics, modern pentathlon, sailing, cycling and boxing.</p>",
  "<p> Just as Portsmouth were preparing to reap the reward of a goal of the highest quality, they were undone by one of farcical proportions. No wonder Harry Redknapp was left shaking his head in frustration afterwards. Yet as wretched as the manager felt about the unlikeliest of finishes, his normally dependable goalkeeper Shaka Hislop was feeling a lot worse. </p> <p>Even allowing for the way Jonathan Fortune's free-kick brushed off Arjan De Zeeuw and David Unsworth with three minutes of normal time remaining, Hislop should not have been troubled. But he could only help the ball into the net to present Charlton with their first points of the season. </p> <p>'It's not so bad when you lose to a decent goal, but this was so bizarre - a farce,' said Redknapp. 'What can you say to players after that? There was nothing in the game at the time. Shaka is low, but he doesn't make many mistakes. He's done great for me as a free transfer signing.' </p> <p>The contrast to Patrik Berger's early second-half equaliser that breathed new life into Portsmouth could not have been sharper. Receiving Unsworth's free-kick 30 yards out and to the left of goal, Berger turned away from his former Liverpool team-mate Danny Murphy and volleyed spectacularly into the far corner of the net. </p> <p>'It will probably be goal of the season,' predicted Charlton manager Alan Curbishley, who admitted that he didn't mind how his team came out on top. 'After a shocking performance at Bolton [they lost 4-1], the only thing that mattered to us was to win the game. We owed it to the fans who travelled up there. Overall, I thought we deserved it for being sharper and more committed.' </p> <p>Curbishley believes it will take time for his new players to bed in, although there were signs here that Murphy could prove to be a major asset. His influence in the first half-hour was so pronounced that Charlton deserved to have more to show for their superiority than Jason Euell's no-nonsense finish from eight yards after Kevin Lisbie's cross broke kindly for him. </p> <p>Lisbie hit the crossbar with a header from Murphy's corner, while Portsmouth's finishing was poor. Unsworth and Lomano LuaLua passed up presentable chances either side of half-time. Redknapp bemoaned a shortage of attacking options, a situation that will hopefully be improved by the signing of Preston striker Ricardo Fuller. </p> <p>Although Murphy's input was less pronounced after the interval, Charlton could still have been back in control before that late fluke, but Lisbie placed his shot too near Hislop. </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Michael Vaughan belongs thank goodness, to the creative brand of captains, one of those who see each ball as a new event that may call for some new ploy or strategy in the field. There are no restrictions or rules about where the nine fielders are to stand and Vaughan has no compunction about putting them, on occasion, in unorthodox places. </p> <p>On Friday, for example, his entire leg-side field for Chris Gayle against Steve Harmison was deep fine leg, long leg and deep midwicket. Yesterday he modified this at the start, bringing one of the deep fielders in to short square-leg. For the second over, he added a mid-on and moved the short leg behind square. On Friday, he had two gullys for Gayle, one orthodox, the other deeper and almost over the ordinary gully's left shoulder. </p> <p>One may not always agree with each move. For instance, I felt during the series that by keeping the leg-side field back, too much scope was given to Shivnarine Chanderpaul to take easy singles and twos; Chanderpaul is a great worker of the ball, content to keep rotating the strike, not needing the adrenaline kick of regular boundaries. But with Vaughan, I can always see his point. There is always a logic to it. </p> <p>Gayle is an interesting bowler to set fields to. He lives by the motto of Seymour Nurse, the old Barbadian batsman: 'If it there, knock it, man.' For Gayle the ball is almost always 'there'. On a true pitch, like this Oval one, I thought England's tactics against him yesterday were right - to bowl a basic line of leg stump at him, with occasional balls bowled wide of off stump to tempt him. </p> <p>But he still scored 25 runs in the first half-hour with nonchalant ease. And when he deposits a straight good-length ball from James Anderson over long-on for six, or strokes and bludgeons six fours off a respectable over from Matthew Hoggard with the new ball, there are limits to the scope of a captain to do much about it. </p> <p>The captain's tactics with the much-improved Ashley Giles have also been interesting and productive. Basically, England have used an in-out field to Gayle, with three men back on the leg-side boundary, as well as a man back behind square on the off side. But there have usually been two, if not three, close catchers. </p> <p>The batsman is thus invited to push the ball for singles, which may, when the ball turns out of the rough, make him vulnerable to bat-pad catches as well as to being bowled through the gate. Moreover, Gayle is a batsman who finds the big hit over the top his safest way out when struggling to defend against the turning ball. He may also be one of those players who gets frustrated when not scoring boundaries, so giving him singles may pay in the long run. Giles has taken Gayle's wicket three times this series, the last one being at Old Trafford, when he drilled the ball straight to Hoggard at long-on. </p> <p>The battle with Lara has also been fascinating, and is one England have won in restricting him to a series average of less than 35. Andrew Flintoff and Harmison clearly feel they are in with a chance with the short-pitched ball and they have made use of the fact that Lara, when peppered in this way, tends to race across the crease towards cover, thus playing the ball on the move and leaving his leg stump open. Again, the captain and team seem well prepared, flexible, yet willing to persist in a good plan. </p> <p>This radical approach to captaincy carries the risk of change for change's sake, and of unnecessary disruption of bowlers' rhythm. But part of England's new attitude seems to be a willingness to embrace flexibility and change, not to be flustered by being asked to try something new, or to risk going for runs. </p> <p>This openness to innovation, even to short-term personal disadvantage, is part of the enlivening team spirit engendered by Vaughan and, no doubt, the coach Duncan Fletcher. It is an attitude that may well have started more modestly with the stolid, groundbreaking work of Nasser Hussain. </p> <p>I happened to hear Michael Holding speak on the radio last Friday about the crisis in West Indian cricket. He said he wished to see the team become hard to beat, to play with discipline. Only once this was in place could success be hoped for. </p> <p>This first step was what Hussain and Fletcher did for England, and the more relaxed and enterprising Vaughan is just the man to reap the fruits of this preparation of the soil and take England on to new levels of achievement. Roll on the Australians. </p> <p>One final thought about Vaughan: he keeps control of his face. Despite the intrusive camera, he is rarely caught with a look of impatience or criticism at his own team. As someone who was not always tolerant or self-controlled, I admire him for it.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>This is Anfield. Liverpool's new manager, Rafael Benitez, was left in no doubt about the task he faces. First, the expectation of a frustrated crowd yearning for success after 15 years without a League title. And second, the disorganisation of his side who played the first half with a lack of cohesion. </p> <p>Liverpool left the field after 45 minutes trailing to a Nicolas Anelka goal that defied the run of play. City had come for a draw. They showed little inclination to go forward and when Shaun Wright-Phillips lobbed the ball forward for Anelka to chase, the home defence was taken by surprise. Jamie Carragher and Jerzy Dudek made a mess of coping with the threat. The keeper let the ball slide out of his grasp and Anelka pounced like a true predator. </p> <p>It was time for the man who led Valencia to two domestic titles to earn his corn. And quickly. </p> <p>Liverpool levelled the scores within three minutes of the restart. Josemi, making his home debut, knocked the ball in from the right. Steven Gerrard, who had a fine game, stroked a pass to the feet of Milan Baros and the Czech striker found the net from close range. </p> <p>Now Liverpool began to motor. David James in the City goal had plenty to cope with and he didn't always cope well. He fumbled as many as he caught but deserves credit for stopping a rush on goal by Djibril Ciss\u00e9 and pulling off a left-handed save to deny Baros. </p> <p>But he was helpless to keep out Gerrard's winner. Baros shot from close range and James parried the ball to the feet of the Liverpool captain who rammed it home with some style. </p> <p>City, by this time, were on the ropes and they suffered a body blow in the closing minutes when Richard Dunne was sent off for a second bookable offence. </p> <p>It was a curious business. Dunne certainly appeared to hold back Baros but referee Graham Poll waved play on. He then stopped the game and consulted a linesman before giving the City man his marching orders and awarding a free-kick to Liverpool. </p> <p>'I'm not going to comment,' said City manager Kevin Keegan of the incident, before commenting at length. </p> <p>'When the referee has to call his linesman for police protection as they go down the tunnel that says it all. Our players thought Baros was offside. The referee didn't give the foul at first and the linesman wasn't with play.' </p> <p>But he acknowledged that his side had been poor. 'We didn't play great. We never got our game going properly.' </p> <p>Benitez said: 'We can score a lot of goals with this side. It was good that we won because it makes the fans happy.' </p> <p>One suspects that the jury is still out. Ciss\u00e9 flitted in and out of the game, occasionally showing his pace and close control. But it was Baros, the workhorse, who posed the greater threat. And where would they be without Gerrard? He wins so much ball, testing the keeper with his cannonball shots and caressing the ball to open up the defence. </p> <p>As for City, what of Wright-Phillips? The young man who thrilled St James' Park with his debut goal for England last Wednesday was largely played off the pitch by John Arne Riise. </p> <p>The match over, Ciss\u00e9 sowed the seeds of a love affair with the fans by strolling across the pitch and tossing his shirt into the Kop. Whether this show of affection will be reciprocated only time will tell. </p> <p><strong> Man of the match:</strong> Gerrard - a dynamic force. </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>'Put more oil in - China, </p> <p>Put more oil in - China.' </p> <p>This is the chant with which the Chinese supporters cheer on their compatriots. The reference to oil is not an implied slight on recent American foreign policy but because the athletes are being metaphorically compared to motor cars. Over the past week or so, it has been sounding with regularity as the Chinese continue to vie with the Americans at the top of the medals table. </p> <p>That there should be sporting parity between the countries is fairly remarkable. China won their first gold medals in 1984 in Los Angeles. Four years later, in Seoul, they won only five gold medals. Compare and contrast with the United States, who have finished top of the medals table in 15 of the 25 Olympics, three blips occurring early in the last century when they finished second to France (Athens, 1906), Great Britain (London, 1908) and Germany (Berlin, 1936) and a further seven between 1956 and 1992, when the USSR topped the table more often than not. The nadir came in 1988, when they had their lowest finish as the richest country, materially, in the history of mankind when they were beaten not only by the USSR but also by East Germany. Since the Games began, the US have won more than twice as many golds as any other country. </p> <p>It is doubtful that one should take games too seriously, but some things can perhaps be learnt from the countries that take the Games very seriously. During the Cold War, it was easy, albeit somewhat facile, to see the struggle at the top of the medals table as one between competing political philosophies - a competition to see whether better athletes were produced under a communist or a capitalist system, or, more cynically, whether a gifted pharmacologist was more likely to fulfil his potential within the confines of state control or in a free-market jamboree. It was a contest, whichever way you look at it, in which the US finished second best. </p> <p>The collapse of the USSR appeared to leave the US as dominant at the Games as they are on the world stage. Instead, such is the pace of change, a new challenger has appeared within a decade employing a system that is a synthesis of capitalism and communism. </p> <p>This was made clear by Bao Tong, an official with the Chinese badminton federation, who says of his team :'It is like a machine - it must keep going on, step by step. Our national team is much more disciplined than some others.' He went on to point out that the Chinese badminton federation has as many sponsors as the richest Western nations. 'It means we have a very good budget and our players can take part in all the major tournaments.' </p> <p>Their dedication leaves rival coaches with their work cut out. 'If you hit the shuttle 10,000 times more, then you will be better,' said Sweden's badminton coach Jens Olsson. 'We simply can't get nine- and 10-year-olds to practise twice a day.' Asked if China would continue to dominate, he replied: 'It doesn't look good for the other countries.' </p> <p>To no one's surprise, the Chinese won two golds and a bronze in the first two badminton events. Jun Zhang, one half of the pair who defeated Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms in the mixed doubles final, said: 'We shall continue to play together and represent China until we are replaced by a younger pair.' </p> <p>Mi Zhou, who won bronze in the women's singles, said of her compatriot: 'I have to congratulate Ning Zhang because I think it is a miracle. She is 29 and she won the gold medal.' </p> <p>The emphasis on youth is telling because the truly remarkable fact is that China are achieving equality with the US, even though they are treating this Games as a preparatory exercise. The fact is, 323 of their athletes - 80 per cent of their team - are making their Olympic debuts in Athens. 'We really want to take the opportunity provided by the Athens Games to let more young Chinese athletes participate in additional events so that we can accumulate more experience for the Beijing Games,' said Li Furong, vice chef de mission. 'We have rigid rules to ensure choosing the best for the squad, but we also put the 2008 Olympics into consideration.' </p> <p>As a consequence, the Chinese have left behind men's world badminton champion Xia Xuanze and world and Olympic women's diving champion Li Na. </p> <p>Whereas the US have been forced to field a youthful track and field team because so many of their seniors are under investigation, the Chinese have opted to send a young team to ensure success in the next Games, in which they will have a double advantage. </p> <p>First, as hosts, it should not be beyond them to finesse some of the rules. At present they are allowed only four athletes in the seven women's weightlifting categories. If each event were open to all (a nice capitalist concept), they could double their medal haul. Likewise, they might change the irritating table tennis regulations that only allow three competitors from each country, meaning that six of the top 20 women (all Chinese) and four of the top 20 men (all Chinese) are not in Athens. </p> <p>Secondly, they can exert some state control to ensure they maximise their resources. In short, they can target easy golds in, for instance, rowing. In Sydney four years ago, 39 medals were awarded in the sport and all of them were won by people from European and English-speaking nations. A four-year plan could be initiated to ensure that there is no such repeat in Beijing. An inquiry should also be held into why 100 per cent of Chinese swimming medals have been won by their women. It is time for their men to contribute more. Of all the athletes here, 33 per cent are women, but in China's team that representation is 75 per cent. </p> <p>Finally, and inevitably, there is the question of numbers. 'We already have 1,941 athletes in our sights who are possible participants for the 2008 Games,' says Li. That's more than two for every medal. </p> <p>Their time has come: if not now, then in Beijing, and for many Games thereafter. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Amir Khan, the 17-year-old lightweight from Bolton who is carrying Britain's boxing hopes here alone, has created a stir not witnessed in an Olympic ring since Sugar Ray Leonard lit up Montreal 28 years ago. </p> <p>Victory persuaded Leonard to turn professional rather than go to Harvard to study law; Khan, a full-time sports-development student at Bolton College, says he has no plans to give up the amateurs yet - which will make a few promoters cry into their caviar. For now, this tournament has been all about 'The Kid'. And he's loving it. </p> <p>It's not just the hardcore audience of boxing enthusiasts who are awestruck by his talent. While he has turned the Peristeri Olympic Boxing Hall into a house of pain for two opponents older and more experienced than he is, his fame is also spreading through the Olympic village. Athletes from all camps are asking: 'Who's the young guy?' </p> <p>There is a feeling that we are witnessing something special - even among those who gave him 'no chance' after one slow round in an otherwise comprehensive stoppage victory over the local late qualifier, Marios Kaperonis, last Monday. </p> <p>He has quick hands, quick feet and, just as important, a quick brain. He can lead and he can counter, he hits hard with both hands and he is rarely flustered, floating out of trouble then back into hitting range with a flashy mix of hooks and uppercuts, rare in the amateur game. There has not been a more exciting presence in British boxing since Naseem Hamed. </p> <p>As for The Kid, he has not lost his own sense of wonder. 'It's just a great achievement to be walking around in the village and seeing Paula Radcliffe and all the top stars,' he said after his latest demolition job, a 37-21 win in the second and final preliminary round last Friday over the second-best 60kg boxer in the world, Dimitar Stilianov, of Bulgaria. </p> <p>Khan fights again on Tuesday, in the quarter-finals against a decent 24-year-old South Korean, Jong Sub Baik. Thereafter, the semi-finals are on Friday and, if he survives, he almost certainly goes up against the boxer considered by many to be the best, pound-for-pound, in the world, amateur or professional, the awesome Cuban, Mario Cesar Kindelan Mesa. </p> <p>Inevitable comparisons have been made between Khan and Hamed. They share electric skill but, it seems, little else. 'I admire Naseem as a boxer, but I can't say I like his attitude very much outside the ring. I have heard from Audley Harrison, but I've had no contact with Naseem.' </p> <p>Harrison, whose gold in Sydney four years ago was Britain's first in the Olympics since Chris Finnegan's in Mexico in 1968, went to Cyprus to lend Khan support at the pre-training camp. Khan also received a welcome letter from the World Boxing Union's world light-welterweight champion, Ricky Hatton, last week. </p> <p>These are gestures appreciated by a teenager who is bearing the weight of sole selection with remarkable equanimity. </p> <p>His national team coach, Terry Edwards, said: 'It's a lot easier with just one boxer because we have more time for each other. I've also learned how to rap and I'm OK with garage music. He's still not too clever on the Frank Sinatra stuff, but by next weekend he'll be singing 'My Way'.' </p> <p>Whatever way it goes, Khan is eerily relaxed, given the magnitude of his task. He is strongly favoured to beat Baik, and if he can show the form he displayed against Stilianov, 10 years his senior and a southpaw who recently won the European title, he will give the mighty Kindelan, also a southpaw, a lot to think about. </p> <p>The Cuban legend, who is now 32, is retiring after these Games. Khan says he wants one more Olympics before turning professional. </p> <p>It genuinely does feel like the changing of the guard. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>A beautifully taken Mohammed Emad overhead kick knocked Australia out of the tournament and gave Iraq, who were reinstated by the International Olympic Committee only in February this year, a scarcely believable but highly deserved place in the semi-finals and offer a flicker of happiness to a country that has endured so much over the past years. </p> <p>'Our families are suffering at the moment,' said Iraq coach Hamad Majeed. 'But at least this will give them something.'</p> <p>It was the result that neutrals and the watching Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, would have wished for. That Iraq even qualified for the closing stages of the Olympic football tournament for the first time since the Seoul games of 1998 is a heck of a story that just keeps on improving and one that Blatter's presence here in Crete indicated he wishes to be a part of. </p> <p>In winning their group, Iraq beat a Portugal team containing Cristiano Ronaldo, Luis Boa Morte and Hugo Viana along the way. When the final whistle went to confirm that 4-2 victory, Blatter raised the hand of Hussein Saeed, Iraq's football president, who was sitting next to him in the family section of the Pampeloponnisiako Stadium in Patras. </p> <p>Saeed is a former Iraqi football star of the 1980s whose abilities brought him a job working for the brutal Uday Hussein until his father, Saddam, was ousted. </p> <p>Before Uday died in a firefight with US forces, the younger Hussein controlled the Olympic and football organisations of Iraq, embezzling money and handing out humiliating and cruel beatings to Iraq sportsmen and women. </p> <p>Saeed is said to have singled out footballers who were not performing for Uday's punishments. 'Footballers were always well organised in Iraq, though not always well treated,' Blatter said. Was he, then, embarrassed, raising the hand of a man who played a direct part in Iraq's atrocities? 'He [Saeed] was at the time the general secretary of the Iraq Football Federation. He was also a member of one of Fifa's committees and was always a good standing member of that committee. </p> <p> 'We helped him to take the leadership of the federation despite opposition inside the country. We trust him. We [want to] forget what has happened in the politics in Iraq. We are going forward and working not only for football but for peace, and football can be one of the tools not only in this country but all around the world.' </p> <p>On the pitch, Iraq dominated the first half. Emad's neat control but flailing shot from inside the box was just one of many chances they failed to convert in the final third. </p> <p>When Australia goalkeeper Eugene Galekovic came for a corner and missed, Mohammed Hawar, a Kurd who was forced to use a machine gun during the war with Iraq to protect his family, found himself with the ball, but the Roos scrambled it away. </p> <p>Bernard Stange, the coach who orchestrated Iraq's route to Greece, is not here. As a strong critic of Saeed's championing by Fifa, he was forced out a month before this tournament and replaced by the present coach, Hamad Uday - a Saeed man. </p> <p>The Iraq team say they miss their erstwhile coach and he has called to congratulate them on their success here, which has followed his own remarkable achievement in somehow guiding a team to Athens who had little kit, trained on dirt, and played all their 'home' qualifying games in Jordan. </p> <p> Stange's salary was stopped at the beginning of the year, his driver was assassinated, and warnings from the government that he should leave before he was killed forced his return to Germany. </p> <p>There he continued to coach the team by phone, meeting them only when they played abroad. 'Stange is our friend and of course we have spoken to him during the tournament,' said Majeed. </p> <p>Australia will be furious with themselves, having enjoyed numerous chances, as their coach, Frank Farina, pointed out. 'We just couldn't convert,' he said. </p> <p> Missing Tim Cahill, Craig Moore and Ahmad Ellrich through suspension, they did have the ball in the net minutes after the restart, but Anthony Danze's goal was rightly ruled offside by linesman. </p> <p>Then came Emad's goal. A 64th-minute corner was headed back into the box by substitute Karim Madhi, and the little midfielder swivelled to score past Galekovic for his own piece of Olympic history. </p> <p> Farina was asked if losing to the Olympics Cinderella team made the defeat any easier to take: 'Not really. It was a game of football. We wanted to win.' </p> <p> Iraq now have two games of football remaining. A victory in one and they will double their Olympic medal tally to two and end the 44-year wait to add to Abdul Aziz's weightlifting bronze at the Rome games. </p> <p><strong>QUARTER FINALS</strong> </p> <p><strong>Italy 1-0 Mali (aet)</strong> </p> <p>Bovo 116 </p> <p><strong> Iraq 1 - 0 Australia</strong> </p> <p>Emad 64 </p> <p><strong>Argentina L-L Costa Rica</strong> </p> <p><strong> Paraguay L - L S Korea</strong> </p> <p><strong> SEMI-FINALS</strong> </p> <p>Tuesday: Italy v Argentina/Costa Rica (Athens, 4pm) </p> <p>Iraq v Paraguay/South Korea (Thessaloniki, 7pm) </p> <p><strong> FINAL</strong> </p> <p>Olympic Stadium, Saturday, 8am </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>It costs only \u20ac10, making it the cheapest event to watch here, but those who have managed to obtain a ticket for the finish of today's women's marathon in the Panathinaiko Stadium are considered to be among the luckiest in town. </p> <p>If all goes according to the formbook, at about 6.20pm BST Paula Radcliffe will enter the spectacular arena that staged the first modern Games here in 1896, to be acclaimed by a crowd of about 50,000 as Britain's first Olympic gold medallist in the marathon. </p> <p>Radcliffe's world record of 2 hours 15 min 25 sec means she has run more than three minutes faster than anyone else over the 26.2-mile distance, is by far the quickest track runner and is almost certainly the best prepared. Such superiority would normally guarantee anyone success. </p> <p>But Radcliffe must take nothing for granted. Another Briton, Steve Jones, went into the 1986 European Championship marathon with an even greater margin of superiority over his rivals. Jones stayed with the pack through the early miles before setting off at a pace that even he could not handle. Three minutes clear of his rivals at one point, Jones eventually finished near last, dehydrated and exhausted. </p> <p>'She can't go out and blast it as she might want to,' warned Steve Cram, the former world 1500 metres and mile record holder. </p> <p>'I think this will be a race of surges, of little changes of pace, rather than the consistently fast, front-running style we saw in London and Chicago.' </p> <p>The first thing Radcliffe has done on the morning of her three previous marathons is check on the weather. There is no need to do that here: she knows it will be hot, hot, hot. Temperatures could be as high as 100F when the marathon starts. </p> <p>Allied to the conditions will be a course that has a reputation for being especially brutal. After winning a rehearsal event on the course in 2002, Kenya's Mark Saina said it was 'the toughest course I've ever run', and Saina finished seven minutes outside the course record by Coventry's Bill Adcocks of 2:11:07. </p> <p>'From 20km to 32km, the course rises 650 feet,' said Adcocks. 'There are a lot of hills and some are very hard. Paula's not going to set a world record there. A time of 2:22 would be phenomenal and hopefully still leave her clear of anyone else.' </p> <p>Dr David Martin, the co-author with Seb Coe's father, Peter Coe, of Training Distance Runners, has studied the course closely and prepared a dossier for the United States team, including Deena Kastor, who could be one of Radcliffe's biggest rivals. </p> <p>'Everyone's heard that the Athens course is hard, but not everyone has seen it, or realises how the hills come at you,' he said. 'They come in a succession of waves. You go up a little, level off, go up a little more, level off, and so on.' </p> <p>Radcliffe has prepared meticulously for this race. She has spent months training at altitude, slept as often as she can, and spent thousands of pounds on making sure she has stayed healthy. </p> <p>Her rivals are waiting to pounce if she is not near her best. Kenya's Catherine Ndereba has twice finished behind Radcliffe, but did win the world title last year. Her team-mate Margaret Okayo succeeded Radcliffe as the London Marathon champion in a race the Briton missed to concentrate on this event. </p> <p>Then there is another East African in the shape of Ethiopia's Elfenesh Alemu, whose husband Gezahenge Abera won the men's title in Sydney four years ago. </p> <p>The Japanese are always strong, having won a medal in each of the past three consecutive Olympics. Their biggest hope is Mizuki Noguchi, who has been training at St Moritz to work especially on coping with the hills here. </p> <p>Then there is always a dark horse. Look out for Zhou Chunxia, who will be running her first marathon outside China where she has run 2:23:28. </p> <p>Team Radcliffe, however, remain confident of victory. Cram, who knows Radcliffe better than nearly anyone outside her immediate circle, sums up their belief. </p> <p>'Will she win? My gut instinct says \"yes\".' </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>After winning Britain's second gold medal in two days of competition, taking cycling to the top of the British medal table alongside the sailors, Bradley Wiggins was dazed but upbeat as he slumped in a chair in the velodrome centre, to reflect on the 256 seconds of pain that felt like a lifetime and could well have changed his 24-year-old life forever. </p> <p>'It's hard to describe,' said the Ghent-born Londoner, whose father Gary competed as a professional, as did his wife Cathy's father, Dave. 'I haven't stopped and thought about what has happened since I finished. Initially I felt relief as I crossed the line that the day was finally over. </p> <p>'Since lunchtime it had been horrible, but I managed to control it. What got to me, what made it unbearable, was the thought of what was about to happen, that this is what the last 12 years of my life have been about and I've got to put it into the next four minutes.' </p> <p>'I was relieved that I wasn't facing [Spain's] Sergi Escobar, I wanted to meet Bradley McGee in the final, but then I thought 'shit, this guy is a fantastic competitor. I may have put two and a half seconds into him yesterday, but you never know, it can be the other way today, because he's such a fighter.' </p> <p>During the four minutes that 'changed his life', Wiggins said he felt 'tremendous concentration and suffering. I was riding on a fine line where you are always on the point of blowing. I got away quick, which was down to the nerves, the aggression, the excitement and the adrenalin. But Brad is a great pursuiter and I had no idea where he was. </p> <p>'I just concentrated on my schedule, which was for a 4min 16sec ride. I had to stay on my schedule and forget about him for the first two kilometres. My coach Simon Jones was walking the line to show me how far ahead I was, and I started to see McGee at six laps to go. </p> <p>'That's the point when you begin to think you've won a pursuit, but at the same time there's an enormous amount of pain, suffering, and I had to block it out and get to the line. I didn't know I'd won until I crossed the line, the last laps I was really suffering, then the feeling was just indescribable, that the four minutes was over at last.' </p> <p>Wiggins' family - Cathy, his mother, brother, and father-in-law - were still on the trackside savouring the occasion a good hour after he had the gold medal slipped over his shoulders, and he was with them again as he had been in the first moments of euphoria when the race was won. </p> <p>'This is for them as much as for me. They live your life not their's, how they live is dictated by what I want to do, that's the sacrifice you have to make when you are going for something this big.' </p> <p>Wiggins will have two further chances to add to his medal haul: in the team pursuit that takes place today and tomorrow - and where he was part of the bronze medal-winning squad in Sydney - and in the madison relay, where he is partnered with Rob Hayles, on Wednesday. </p> <p>'We have a strong chance in the team pursuit, it's been the Australians and us for the last few years. I think the other guys in the team are itching to get on the track, for the last few days we have come back in the evenings and telling them all about it, so they've felt out of it.' </p> <p>The madison, meanwhile, offers the duo a chance to take a medal they lost in Sydney thanks to a crash in the final laps when silver seemed assured. </p> <p>'It's our private little thing, we missed out four years ago, and Rob has now missed out on an individual medal in two Games, so we will be up for it.' </p> <p>Wiggins is proud of his sport, and proud to be part of its new-found prominence. 'British cycling is on top of the world. It's been a long time coming, but it's about time our sport shone.' </p> <p>The next four days could see the lustre become brighter and brighter.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Four gold medals in one day - two on the water, one in the velodrome and one in the courtroom - mean Britain's Olympic team have won more medals by the halfway point of the Athens Games than in the opening week of Sydney 2000.</p> <p>The rowing four of Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell, Ed Coode and Steve Williams won a thrilling race by inches to land Britain's first gold of the day, and Finn sailor Ben Ainslie soon added a second. In mid-afternoon Leslie Law heard that he had been awarded gold in the individual three-day event, following a successful appeal against the German winner, who was disqualified. Shortly after that news, cyclist Bradley Wiggins took gold in the 4,000 metres individual pursuit. </p> <p>By the end of the middle Saturday in Sydney Britain had 14 medals: four gold, seven silver and three bronze. By yesterday evening Britain had 18 - up by eight in one day - with the prospect of plenty more to come. Much of the media criticism of Britain's efforts has been shown to be badly misplaced. </p> <p>'Super Saturday' helped Britain to move up to sixth in the medals table. The victories underline the fact that Britain has significant depth and breadth of talent in many of the 28 Olympic sports. </p> <p>The biggest negatives came in shooting and tennis. There was a lift yesterday for the swimmers when David Davies won bronze in the 1,500m freestyle, taking the team to their target of two medals. Far outweighing any gloom, Britain's cyclists, sailors and rowers have excelled, proving themselves world class. There have been first medals in archery and diving, and the badminton and equestrian performances have been better than those in Sydney. Canoeing has once more yielded two medals, and boxer Amir Khan is a genuine medal prospect. </p> <p>Mike Whittingham, performance adviser at UK Sport, the body charged with making Britain more successful internationally, acknowledged that it took a while last week for any real excitement to build around Team GB. </p> <p>The first four days produced only two medals. 'It was disappointing that we got off to a bad start,' said Whittingham. 'Some early medals in cycling, shooting or swimming would have been good, but the last two days have created a totally different spirit in the camp, and this weekend will be a turning point.' </p> <p>Before Athens, the British Olympic Association expected Britain's 371 competitors to bring home 25 medals, with six to nine golds. This total is three fewer than Sydney but a 'realistic assessment' of the more intense level of global competition. </p> <p>'We're on course for getting very close to our target, and with luck will get 24 or 25 by the end,' said Whittingham, whose best hopes this week are in modern pentathlon, where Georgina Harland and Kate Allenby are strong contenders, taekwondo and athletics. </p> <p>David Moorcroft, chief executive of UK Athletics, said recently that Britain might win no medals at all in Athens. But there is a strong prospect that Kelly Sotherton, in the heptathlon, and Paula Radcliffe will not be the only ones on the podium. Kelly Holmes has a decent chance in both the 800m and 1,500m, along with Phillips Idowu in the triple jump, the men's 4x100m relay team, the women's 4x400m quartet, and Steve Backley in the javelin. If all those came off, Britain would have more athletics medals than in Sydney. </p> <p>The British Olympic Association are jubilant that the 'knockers' have been proved wrong. One official said: 'The real difference is that Jason Queally won a cycling gold in Sydney on day one and that created a positive mood, whereas changes to the scheduling means we didn't get to sports here in which we're strongest until day five, last Wednesday, when we got four medals.' </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Twenty years ago in Los Angeles, Merlene Ottey, then 24, was appearing in her second Olympics for Jamaica, taking bronze in 100 metres and 200m sprints. Last week, in the Olympic village, in Athens, Ottey, now 44 years old, was looking her usual fantastic self as she prepared for a remarkable sixth appearance in the Olympics, this time representing Slovenia. </p> <p>She is a remarkable athlete in more ways than one. You might imagine she is much celebrated back in Cold Spring, where she was born in 1960 and, to a large extent, is still fondly remembered by most of her old friends. But there are plenty of Jamaicans, many of whom voted her their country's sportswoman of the year 15 times between 1979 and 1997, who despise her. Those are significant dates. A year after she was first recognised in her own country as the outstanding athlete she was to become, she appeared in her first Olympics, winning bronze in the 200m in Moscow in 1980, the first of her seven Olympic medals. By 1998 she was still running (she had taken silver in both short sprints at the Atlanta Olympics two years earlier), but was also running out of friends and running into controversy. </p> <p> With her sights set on another Olympics, Ottey was asking a lot of the selectors to trust in her seemingly ageless talent, especially with athletes such as Peta Gaye Dowdie coming through in the 100m. </p> <p>Then Ottey's world slowly turned upside down. Inevitably, injuries became harder to shrug off. Her times slowed and her rivals began to ask serious questions about her worth in the team. So 28 years after her international debut, she took a drastic and unusual decision, leaving Jamaica to train and be treated in Slovenia. She stayed and got a new coach. </p> <p>A year later, in 1999, she was banned for using nandrolone, yet, within 12 months, the International Association of Athletics Federations overturned the decision on a technicality. It seemed that Ottey was blessed. </p> <p> But could she make the Jamaican team one more time? She did, and the howls of derision ran through her sport, most loudly expressed by Dowdie, by then the Jamaican 100m champion but, apparently, not good enough to displace Ottey from the team competing in the Sydney Olympics. </p> <p>In the Olympic village there, a quite extraordinary demonstration by her team-mates all but convinced Ottey she had run out of time and friends in the land of her birth. They marched around the village carrying placards and shouting 'Ottey out! Ottey out!' Heartbreaking as this must have been, she became the oldest athletics medallist in the history of the Olympics when she anchored Jamaica to silver in the 4x100m relay.</p> <p> It was a statement of sorts, but hardly eased the rancour between Ottey and her team-mates. Even as she bathed in the celebrations of having made history, the selectors told her it was time to go. </p> <p> 'I didn't expect it,' she said. 'It was a big shock and I felt really betrayed. I thought I shouldn't be retired too early, but things have changed. I get on better with the athletes now.' </p> <p>One reason for that is she hardly sees them. Ottey quit Jamaica for good in 2001, withdrawing from the national team that went to the world championships. Her manager, Daniel Zimmerman, didn't think her legs would hold up much longer anyhow, but said the deciding factor was the bad feeling that lingered on after Sydney. 'Having half the team protesting against you doesn't make you feel motivated,' he said at the time. </p> <p>Ottey returned to Slovenia and applied for citizenship, which was granted the following year with unseemly haste and without objection by the Olympic association in Jamaica. </p> <p> And, four years on, here she is. As is Dowdie. They will not meet, though, as Dowdie is running only in the relay and Ottey is down for the two short sprints, just as she has been for most of her career. </p> <p> 'I think I have the times to reach the semi-finals of the 100 metres,' she said before last night's showdown with a cast of young and largely unknown rivals. 'But I'm a complete underdog. My goal is just to enjoy it. I would definitely like to get into the final. You can get lucky.' </p> <p>Ottey is not alone among the lucky oldies. Gail Devers, 37, turned up for the 100m too, and is down for the 100m hurdles and the 4x100m relay. Hers is, if anything, a more colourful story than Ottey's.</p> <p> Where the Jamaican runner confronted jealousy and accusations of cheating and disloyalty, the American has had to contend with a much more serious foe. In 1988, she contracted Graves Disease, a thyroid condition that brings on migraines, blurred vision, fainting and sleeplessness. 'I should have been at my peak,' she recalled, 'instead I was constantly exhausted and by body felt out of control.' </p> <p>Her feet started cracking and bleeding and it was thought she might have to have them amputated. 'Deep down I was scared to death,' she said. </p> <p>Devers claims she beat the disease through hard work and prayer, which, for some, is too neat a conclusion. Still, she has survived, self-coached now after parting with her long-time mentor, Bobby Kersee. She trains, believe it or not, against her Pomeranian, Kaleb. 'He starts with me. If you wait too long to shoot the start gun or say, \"Go!\" he'll start barking. If I rest longer than three minutes, he starts yipping. He won't stop until I get on the starting line.'</p> <p> All of which goes to show that youth might be the theme of these games, but age and a certain kind of flawed beauty have their place also. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Twenty years ago in Los Angeles, Steve Redgrave was winning the first of his five rowing gold medals and Merlene Ottey, then 24, was appearing in her second Olympics for Jamaica, taking bronze in both sprints. </p> <p>Last week at a plush private sporting complex in the middle of Athens, Redgrave, now Sir Steve, looked like the retired athlete he is, still strikingly bronzed and wearing his little paunch with style, as he swapped anecdotes with other ex-Olympians. Ten miles away in the Olympic village, Ottey, still plain Merlene and now 44 years old, was looking her usual fantastic self as she prepared for a record seventh appearance in the Olympics, this time representing Slovenia. </p> <p>Ottey is a remarkable athlete in many respects. You might imagine she is much celebrated back in Cold Spring, where she was born in 1960 and, to a large extent, she is still fondly remembered by most of her old friends. But there are plenty of Jamaicans, many of whom voted her their country's sportswoman of the year 15 times between 1979 and 1997, who are less fond of her. </p> <p>Those are significant dates. A year after she was first recognised in her own country as the outstanding athlete she was to become, Ottey appeared in her first Games, winning bronze in the 200 metres in Moscow, the first of seven Olympic medals. By 1998 she was still running (she had taken silver in both sprints at Atlanta two years earlier), but was also running out of friends and running into controversy. </p> <p>With her sights set on another Olympics, Ottey was asking a lot of the selectors to trust in her seemingly ageless talent, especially with the likes of Peta Gaye Dowdie coming through in the 100m. </p> <p>Then Ottey's world slowly turned upside down. Injuries became harder to shrug off, her times slowed and her rivals began to ask serious questions about her worth in the team. So, 28 years after her international debut, she took a drastic decision, leaving Jamaica to train and be treated in Slovenia. She stayed, and got a new coach. A year later, in 1999, she was banned for using nandrolone, yet, within 12 months, the International Associations of Athletics Federations overturned the decision on a technicality. It seemed Ottey was blessed. </p> <p>Could she make the Jamaican team one more time? She did, and the howls of derision ran through her sport, most loudly expressed by Dowdie, by then the Jamaican 100m champion but, apparently, not good enough to displace Ottey from the team competing in the Sydney Olympics. In the Olympic village, a quite extraordinary demonstration by her team-mates all but convinced Ottey she had run out time and friends in the land of her birth. They marched around carrying placards and shouting 'Ottey out! Ottey out!' Heartbreaking as this must have been, she became the oldest Olympic athletics medallist when Jamaica took silver in the 4x100 metres relay. It was a statement of sorts, but hardly eased the rancour between Ottey and her team. Even as she bathed in the celebrations of having made Olympic history, the selectors told her it was time to go. </p> <p>'It was a big shock,' she said. 'I felt really betrayed.

'But I'm a complete underdog. My goal is just to enjoy it. I would definitely like to get into the final. You can get lucky.' </p> <p>She didn't. Having made the semi comfortably, Ottey missed the big one by three-hundredths of a second, finishing fifth. It will not have been lost on anyone familiar with the saga that second place went to her former compatriot, Sherone Simpson. Ottey has another chance in the 200m this week. </p> <p>Gail Devers, 37, also turned up for the 100m too, and is down for the 100m hurdles. But the glamour event, sadly, revealed how the years have eaten away at her speed. Devers, her left calf heavily strapped, was up with the young pups for 50 metres in the other semi, then was swamped in a blanket finish. She walked off, virtually unnoticed, seventh in 11.22sec, a good way slower than the third best Olympic time for the event, the 10.82 she ran in Barcelona. Hers is, if anything, a more colourful story than Ottey's. </p> <p>Where the Jamaican runner confronted jealousy and accusations of cheating and disloyalty, the American has had to contend with a more serious foe. In 1988, she contracted Graves Disease, a thyroid condition that brings on migraines, blurred vision, fainting and insomnia. 'I should have been at my peak,' she recalled. 'Instead I was constantly exhausted and my body felt out of control. Deep down I was scared to death.' </p> <p>Devers claims she beat the disease through hard work and prayer. She has survived, self-coached after parting with her long-time mentor, Bobby Kersee. </p> <p>Astounding as their longevity is, Ottey and Devers have fallen short of matching the oldest woman Olympian, Britain's Lorna Johnstone. She was 70 years and five days when she competed at Munich in 1972 in the dressage. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p><strong>Cassandra and Jane</strong><br>by Jill Pitkeathley<br>Copperfield Books \u00a39.99, pp239</p> <p>'If I am a wild beast, I cannot help it', Jane Austen once remarked. 'It is not my own fault.' But where is that 'wild beast' when you look at the facts? Austen's biographers grapple with the huge gaps in our knowledge of her left by the burning of her letters by her sister, Cassandra, and the bland myth authorised by the Austen family.</p> <p>Jill Pitkeathley's Cassandra and Jane gains access to a kind of imaginative truth (whether factually correct or not) through Cassandra, 70, whose memory gives access, for the first and last time, to her dead sister's secret life.</p> <p>The novel borrows its structure from Citizen Kane, burnt correspondence taking the place of Kane's sled. Was Austen a difficult character? How did she behave in her family? Was she ever in love? Why did she accept a marriage proposal only to reject it the next day?</p> <p>These are some of the questions answered in Cassandra and Jane. In an act of imaginative re-creation, Pitkeathley portrays Austen as painfully sensitive, emotionally volatile, hostile to her mother, bitter, resentful, impulsive and sexually frustrated.</p> <p>Pitkeathley's Austen falls in love with a clergyman in Lyme Regis. The twists and turns of that affair and its extraordinary conclusion form one of the novel's highlights. Could it really have happened? Yes - and the fact that it is pure invention doesn't change our sense that a novelist who saw as deeply into the human heart as Austen must have had some experience of romance.</p> <p>The proposal of marriage from Harris Bigg-Wither one strange evening in December 1802 is well known and Pitkeathley thinks that Cassandra dissuaded Jane partly out of a desire to possess her for herself. In fact, that impulse drives the novel.</p> <p>'I enjoy holding to myself the real Jane,' Cassandra says early on, 'and I know it was I who encouraged her to hide from others what I thought of as her dark side', a side she sought to erase from the historical record. Only she can reveal that Austen was a reader of Wollstonecraft and a proto-feminist, that Austen's depression in Bath stopped her from writing or that when confronted with the ill health of their mother, Austen reacted with anger.</p> <p>Where this novel persuades most is in its detail - the caps worn by women; the apple wood burning in the grate; the subordination in the household of unmarried females. This is the stuff of truth and lends credibility to Pitkeathley's fiction, the most powerful element of which is Cassandra's unassuageable desire to control the way in which her sister was viewed by posterity. Only in these imagined memories is that 'wild beast' allowed to roam at will.</p>",
  "<p>For some years now, this column has dined out on the wonderful statistic that in Britain we publish more than 100,000 new books a year. On several occasions, indeed, we have asserted this to be a record. What's more, since the turn of the century, this astonishing figure has grown more, not less, awesome. The last time I checked, it was possible to claim that this total had risen - sensation! - to something close to 120,000 new titles per annum. </p> <p>If I may take you backstage for a moment into the shabby world of the newspaper column, the beauty of this statistic is that it can be made to argue any number of often quite contradictory points of view. First, without violence to the truth, it can illustrate an awesome contrast with a lost golden age, circa 1900, in which fewer than 10,000 books a year were published. These were the years which saw the best works of Joseph Conrad, Henry James, Conan Doyle, Edith Wharton, etc. Cue a touching eulogy to the glories of Edwardian prose. </p> <p>From here, in columnar terms, it is but a short step to a thunderous ecologo-literary jeremiad about the fate of Scandinavia's forests, and the shameful waste of ink and paper. And thence, with a nimble pas de chat to the present discontents of publishing, its failure to exercise any quality control over the books it takes on, the decline of the editor, the tyranny of the suits, blah, blah, blah. </p> <p>Today, however, I have to admit that the jig is up. In the course of my recent travels in the United States I came across a statistic as big as the Ritz, a factoid so majestic, a calculation so awesome that this week at least we must concede that a new galaxy has appeared in the stellar firmament of the book world. </p> <p>If the image had not already been used to the point of exhaustion, I would say that, upon opening the Sunday 18 July 2004 edition of the New York Times, I found myself, like stout Cortez on his peak in Darien, lost in silent contemplation of a new world. </p> <p>Forget 100,000 books a year, forget the pines of Norway or the cappuccinos of Covent Garden; according to the New York Times, there's a new book published in the United States every half an hour, and - wait for it - that's just fiction. RR Bowker, the company that compiles the Books in Print database in the USA, has calculated that no fewer than 175,000 new titles were published in 2003. That's one book roughly every 20 seconds. </p> <p>Predictably enough, the New York Times then used this figure to rehash lines that, to those of us who row in the galleys of literary commentary, are not exactly new. Books will get lost in the shuffle. New fiction has the shelf-life of yoghurt. It's a winner-takes-all marketplace. (When was that not true?) Reviews cannot keep pace with output. And so on. </p> <p>It occurred to me, as I read this depressing but familiar recital, that in all the hoo-ha about overproduction, there's one person who is rarely referred to: the Common Reader. </p> <p>How many books do you read a year ? A hundred? Forty? Twenty-five? If you manage to read a book a week, which is good going, and perhaps a few extra on holiday, you would not, realistically, complete more than about 55 a year. In my experience, such serious readers prefer seriously good books. They will choose Toni Morrison before Plum Sykes. </p> <p>In other words, it is, once again, the preferences and limitations of the human race that keep the dizzying pace of technological change in check. Call me Dr Pangloss, but works of quality are the ones that endure. Sure, the book world is going to hell in a handcart, but the good news is that we can rely on the readers to keep it honest and, with a bit of luck, an appetite for good books will balance the temptations of trash.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong><a href=\"mailto:robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk\">robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia</strong> <br><strong>by Lutz Kleveman</strong> <br> Atlantic Books \u00a38.99, pp 283 </p> <p> 'To me, I confess, they are the pieces on a chessboard upon which is being played out a game for the dominion of the world.' So Lord Curzon, viceroy of India, described Afghanistan, Persia and their central Asian neighbours in 1898. </p> <p>In that Great Game, Russia and Britain jostled for control of the region, sending soldiers and explorers to pursue each other across desolate mountain passes. More than a century later, Lutz Kleveman takes an engaging tour across the same chessboard, where he finds a new Great Game being played, this time for a far bigger prize, the immense energy reserves which lie beneath the Caspian Sea. </p> <p>America with its insatiable thirst for oil, has taken Britain's place at the chessboard; there is a host of new players, including Iran and China. But the political and military shenanigans still exact an immense human cost. </p> <p>Kleveman lets the many pawns in the contest tell their own stories: the dispossessed Chechen family sheltering in a pigsty in neighbouring Ingushetia; the Muslim leaders of Tashkent looking on as US bombs fall on Afghanistan; the ethnic Uighurs suppressed by China in its western province of Xinjiang. </p> <p>As he meanders through the mountainous and remote region, peeling back the layers of ethnic unrest and religious tension, and bringing alive a cast of shady characters worthy of a le Carr\u00e9 novel, Kleveman repeatedly finds the influence of Russia or the US and the corrupting power of oil at work. </p> <p>Part travel-writing, part polemic, this eminently readable book slots the hostilities in Iraq into the context of a much longer-term struggle for resources. </p> <p>Updated to take Iraq into account, the paperback edition warns in a strident epilogue that one consequence of the US's 'energy imperialism' will be to radicalise many more 'angry young men' across central Asia to take up the struggle against the superpower. </p> <p>It's a much-voiced argument these days, but unlike many of those who make it, Lutz Kleveman has spent time meeting those desperate young men and giving them a voice.</p>",
  "<p>They used to have a grand scam going, did the wee scuzzballs of Glasgow: the grubby 14-year-olds with slyly innocent faces and the rasping 70-a-day voices of octogenarian emphysemics. </p> <p>Whenever they got their collars felt for those cheeky little misdemeanours which so enliven Scottish working-class life - stealing apples, riding karties too fast, firing crossbow bolts through the skull of someone wearing the wrong football shirt - they would give police the same stock answer. </p> <p>'It's a fair cop, guv. I'll come clean. You done got me bang to rights.' </p> <p>It had to be taken down as such and read out in court, more often than not by the same weary cop, who would grow even wearier when he was laughed, again, from the building. </p> <p>Raucously illiterate Glasgow hoolies suddenly talking like Alastair Sim, but with extra wheedling Ealing fruitiness? </p> <p>Shut your face, Plod, away ye go, ye fat lying numpty bampot (as they say in those parts), and away the cop would go, and his face would be shut. </p> <p>Something similar has obviously been happening in the fawn-checked world of Burberry. The goonlike unwashed have now spent years stealing - both figuratively and, I think we can safely say, literally - the clothes of their supposed betters, to the extent that Burberry has now become near-synonymous with football violence and pubs in Leicester have now banned Burberry wearers in case they start glassing each other's Alsatians. </p> <p>Part of the problem, of course, is role models. Search, briefly, for references to famous Burberry wearers of the past few years and you come up with a list which includes Liam Gallagher, Kate Moss, Madonna, Prince William and Victoria Beckham. </p> <p>Wow. Deep breath. I mean, of course it was only going to be a matter of time before Jake Scrote of Chav Poges and his Filthboy Scumcrew started adopting the checks: they were aspirational, they weren't that particularly expensive, not in the grand scheme of things, and they said something about you, and if what that thing they said happened to be: 'I am part of a group of similarly violent morons without discernible individual taste, and I quite fancy Posh', then, hey, it's still nice to be part of a club. </p> <p>But the bigger problem stems from the company itself. Rather than selling just through word of mouth, and simple quality, it went in a big way for branding. </p> <p>The check used to be simple and discreet, seen only deep inside the triple-ply otter-flap or whatever of their raincoats. </p> <p>Sticking it loudly on the outside of everything, in the greedy hope that the aspirational middle classes (and middle classes only) would want to be seen in it well, it was going to rebound, as greed so often does, and now, tee hee, it has. </p> <p>Which leave only one way forward for good true snobs. No identification at all. I know someone who ripped the silver symbol off the front of her Merc because she didn't want to be seen driving a Merc (a pointless gesture I know, but at least it saved a Burberry wearer from doing the same to the car that midnight). </p> <p>I have unpicked hateful logos, crocodiles and the like, from otherwise lovely warm jerseys. The only aftershave worth having comes in an anonymous little black bottle (No 88 from Czech &amp; Speake in Jermyn Street, but don't tell everyone). </p> <p>Clothes should be unidentifiable, other than by their cut: Jaeger will do, just. Perhaps it could delight the snob in me by including a tiny printed flap (tasteful typeface, Garamond or Hoefler, on cream Egyptian cotton) inside the otter-pocket, reading: 'As not worn by royalty'.</p>",

  "<p>Debbie Thiel can't get enough of the new Sainsbury's Marketplace in Pimlico, central London. 'It's sort of embarrassing, but this place has really improved our quality of life,' admits the 27-year-old interior designer, who says she drops into the stylish supermarket at least once a day to shop for herself and her fianc\u00e9, Eric.</p> <p>The Marketplace is Sainsbury's trendiest new retail concept, intended to combine the exclusivity of a luxury grocer with the selection and value of a regular supermarket. Fresh-food islands float haphazardly through the cavernous, warehouse-like layout, followed by spacious aisles of perfectly stacked tins and household goods. A smell of warm bread wafts from the bakery. Behind, rows of spatchcocked chickens obediently rotate. Dim lighting and tranquil music cast a sexy, cool glow. </p> <p>Debbie says her grocery bills have rocketed since the new shop arrived: she just can't resist the premium ready meals, organic produce and expensive cuts from the butcher. The couple now spend, on average, \u00a3100 each week - about \u00a350 more than they used to. Although they save by eating out less now, it's not enough to compensate. 'The credit card bill at the end of the month is just higher overall,' Debbie admits. </p> <p>She is not alone. Supermarket shopping has become a serious part of our lives as well as our budgets. Large families as well as couples are shopping more and buying more non-food items. Grocers now take 49p of every \u00a31 spent by Britons at retail outlets, according to a new report from IGD, the grocery industry think-tank. </p> <p>As a nation, we ring up more than \u00a3100 billion every year at supermarkets. A third is spent at the largest retailers, including Asda, Morrison, Tesco and Sainsbury. </p> <p>Consumers have good reason to enjoy food shopping more than ever before. 'Food is cheaper and consumers have never been offered better value in terms of quality, choice and price,' says David Gordon of IGD. </p> <p>Groceries now rank as the nation's third-largest household expense, but it's not an area many consider when trying to cut costs. We're more concerned with convenience, say experts, and generally believe supermarkets will always offer good value and competitive prices. According to Phil Evans of the Consumers' Association, people think of food shopping as a small luxury, even during lean times. And those on tight budgets often end up with the expensive brands in their baskets, he says. </p> <p>Supermarkets make spending impossible to resist. Mind-numbing price offers encourage us to stock up on foods we might not need or even like. Snazzy layouts steer us towards the most expensive items. Ever-changing varieties make it difficult to stick to a shopping list. At the till, self-swipe credit card machines make us feel in control as they help us overspend and forget. </p> <p>William Young, an environmental professor and author of Sold Out: The True Cost of Supermarket Shopping, believes supermarkets are far less friendly to consumers and local communi ties than they appear. 'Supermarkets sell us the image of clean, cheap and healthy food, but the reality is very different,' he says. </p> <p>The largest retailers aggressively reduce their prices on a few key items, such as a popular brand of breakfast cereal or a top-selling toy, to entice shoppers and create a sense of trust. Lured by these loss leaders, shoppers use supermarkets as a one-stop shop for all their household needs, from barbecue kits to Chardonnay to deodorant. </p> <p>'Supermarkets dominate not just the grocery market, but also, increasingly, other areas, from clothes to financial services,' explains Young. </p> <p>But despite our fascination with supermarkets, trimming the grocery bill is far easier than it sounds - and even the busiest shoppers can save without sacrificing convenience and quality.</p> <p><strong>How to cut the grocery bill</strong></p> <p>Like other areas of personal finance, maintaining a food budget is all about sticking to your needs and delving beyond persuasive sales tactics. Here are some of the experts' top tips. </p> <p>Slow down and look around: 'There's a whole science behind product placement,' explains Phil Evans of the Consumers' Association. Shoppers tend to focus on products located at chest level and a third of the way down the aisle - and there's a good chance that's where you'll find the most expensive brands that generate the most profit, with the cheaper brands distributed above, below and behind you. Make a point of stopping to compare all your options before grabbing the first item - it's likely to be the least economical.</p> <p>Two-for-one or two-for-two? It pays to check the small print on promotionals before loading up on larger-than-necessary quantities; the discount may also apply if only one of the items is bought. A '2 for \u00a32' promotion on honeydew melons, for example, may actually mean that each melon individually costs \u00a31.</p> <p>Buy produce locally: time and again, price comparisons of fresh produce show the local market or independent grocer is often cheaper and fresher than the supermarket, says environmental writer and academic Dr William Young. One survey by Sustain, the food and farming issues charity, showed seasonal fruit and veg purchased at market stalls was 30 per cent cheaper than supermarket prices. The pro duce is likely to be locally sourced, not to mention better for local business.</p> <p>Convenience meals are bad for the budget. Supermarkets are devoting extra shelf space to prepared foods, including ready-washed salads, microwave meals and 'partially made' dinners, where all the preparation work is already done. Convenience, however, comes at a price and most prepared meals are poor value, says Evans.</p> <p>Although people understand they're paying more for convenience foods, they don't realise how little effort it takes to assemble meals themselves. The difference may be a little elbow grease or a knob of butter, but you'll often pay twice as much for a ready-to-cook meal than you would buying the ingredients and assembling them yourself. At upmarket Waitrose, a four-pack of beefburgers retails for \u00a36.56 a kilo, whereas mince costs \u00a32.18 a kilo - a big difference for a few minutes of preparation.</p> <p>Don't be fooled by unit prices: supermarkets cleverly mix and match units of measurement that make comparing prices difficult, says Young. Consumers can easily mistake a 99p-a-100-gram 'sale' on minced pork as better value than a pound of the same mince for \u00a32.50. The latter, converted to metric, works out as 55p for 100 grams. As a rule of thumb, two pounds is equal to a little less than one kilo. Carry a pocket calculator, or use the one on your mobile, and get in the habit of converting prices to one standard unit.</p> <p>Keep a list of prices and take note of when your favourite items go on sale - you're likely to spot monthly patterns, so you'll know when to stock up.</p> <p>Buying in bulk is not always better, especially when it comes to fresh produce. Again, retailers can make it difficult to compare prices quickly. At Tesco, for example, a multi-pack of tomatoes selling for 52p has a unit price of 8.7p a tomato - not much help for shoppers who want to compare it to the loose tomatoes selling for 45p a pound. To find the better value, scout out the little-used measuring scale that still hangs somewhere in the produce section and compare the weights of both items. Weighing in at 69p a pound, the multipack turns out to be far more expensive than the loose variety.</p> <p>Stick to the edges: staple items like milk and bread tend to be located around the edges of the store and far from the entrance. Getting there means traversing the store's expensive middle section, full of seasonal sweets and promotional displays.</p> <p>Convenience-size stores may be no bargain: compact versions of big retailers, like Sainsbury's Locals and Tesco Metros, are popular with commuters and late-night shoppers, but prices can be higher than at the larger stores, warns Evans. Advertised discounts may not apply, and ranges may be limited to the more expensive brands.</p> <p>Avoid non-food items, and other things that are not on your list. Razor-thin margins on food mean supermarkets are devoting more shelf space to profitable household lines, including cookware, cosmetics, and extensive wine selections, but not all of them are a good deal. If it's not on your shopping list, don't buy it until you've had a chance to compare prices; chances are you'll find it cheaper elsewhere. Many wine stores, for example, offer wider selections, extra discounts and free delivery.</p> <p>Shop less: it sounds simple, but you're less likely to overspend if you're not tempted as often. Try to stick to one large shop each week, when you're more likely to take advantage of bulk and multi-buy discounts, and use local butchers, fishmongers and grocers in between.</p> <p>Buy store-brand household products; many shoppers know that supermarkets' own-label cleaners and paper products are good value and do the job just as well as expensive brands. Be aware that many retailers are broadening their own-label lines into premium ranges, with prices to match; check if an economy line is also offered and always compare prices.</p> <p>Pay in cash: paying with cash is one of the simplest and most effective ways of sticking to a food budget. When it's not in your purse, you simply can't spend it.</p> <p>Have a goal: establish a 'supermarket savings fund' and get every member of the household involved. Come up with a fun goal for the proceeds and stash all unused change after each shop. You'll be surprised how quickly it adds up.</p>",
  "<p>Rentokil chairman Brian McGowan is expected to renew the group's appetite for acquisitions when he unveils the results of a three-month internal review on Thursday.</p> <p>The move will come as analysts and investors quiz McGowan on whether he plans to dispose of non-core businesses such as conferencing and parcels. </p> <p>But a disposals programme, which could net up to \u00a31 billion according to some analysts, is not now expected to figure as part of McGowan's findings. </p> <p>He is expected to leave the door open to disposals, but will explain that the decision on the shape of the group must be taken by a new chief executive. </p> <p>Rentokil is seeking to fill the vacancy after James Wilde left the company at the end of July. </p> <p>People close to the company said McGowan would point to the company's strong cash generation. 'There is cash in the bank for acquisitions, and there are targets in mind related to the hygiene business,' one said. He added that McGowan believed the company's acquisitive streak had become less pronounced in recent years and needed to be regenerated. </p> <p>Any move to growing the core hygiene business - which ranges from contract cleaning to pest control - through acquisition would mark a return to the strategy adopted by Sir Clive Thompson, Rentokil's chief executive from 1983 until 2002. Thompson was nicknamed Mr Twenty Per Cent for his ability to deliver consistent growth. </p> <p>McGowan will also discuss the prospects of a share buy-back programme in the absence of a disposals programme. </p> <p>One analyst said: 'There is a credibility problem because there is a wide expectation of a programme of disposals, but it is clear that he can't do anything until he has a new CEO in place. </p> <p>'He has to fill the gap with something and a share buy-back programme would be one way of doing it.' </p> <p>McGowan is also expected to raise the interim dividend on Thursday.</p>",
  "<p>Royal Mail is set to fail all 15 of its service quality targets for the first three months of the financial year - following a similar failure for the previous 12 months.</p> <p>The company's record for delivering first class post the following day - its highest profile target - fell from the 2003-4 rate of 90.1 per cent to 88.2 per cent between April and June, against a target of 92.5 per cent. For one week in April it managed to deliver only 82 per cent of first class letters on the following day. </p> <p>However, there are indications that Royal Mail is reversing the slump in performance. In July it managed around 91 per cent by the following day and in August it expects to reach 92 per cent. </p> <p>The results have prompted an angry response from Postwatch, the consumer watchdog for mail services. A spokesman said: 'From our regular contacts with Royal Mail we understand that they are below-target on all 15 of their performance targets. In April, Adam Crozier [Royal Mail chief executive] said he was taking personal control and he would ensure that things would get better. How long do we have to wait? These are minimum targets and they need to be hit for customers to get an acceptable service.' </p> <p>Crozier said in April that operational changes across 1,500 local offices meant hitting service standards would be difficult. He has repeatedly apologised to customers for the performance standards. In May, he said: 'We apologise to customers who will continue to see adverse effects while we complete these key operational changes in our letters business.' </p> <p>He is likely to do so again when the first-quarter figures are revealed within the next 10 days, although he will also point to the 10 per cent improvement since the low point in April. </p> <p>A Royal Mail spokesman said: 'It [the latest set of figures] will confirm what we have already been saying for several months - that service levels dipped because of the sheer scale of the operational changes we have been making to modernise Royal Mail.' </p> <p>The 15 service quality targets cover deliveries of first and second class mail, along with a range of other products for domestic and business consumers. </p> <p>Postcomm, the industry's economic regulator, is investigating the performance in 2003-4. It is likely to roll the first three months of this year into that inquiry if there is no improvement in standards.</p>",
  "<p>Branding forces companies to ask the question: 'What's the purpose of our business?' The answer used to be simple: 'To make money.' </p> <p>We used to accept that as the natural response. Now, however, we expect a bit more and branding is integral to the way businesses give their answers. So, as well as the commercial purpose - making money keeps you in business - companies now believe they have wider social and ethical roles. </p> <p>The way they make these roles as distinctive as possible gives definition to a brand, because branding is all about making a company seem special and different. We have an increasing acceptance, inside and outside business circles, that companies have more than just a commercial reason for being. This means accepting that brands also have a conscience. </p> <p>Starbucks is certainly a brand with a conscience. This has made it particularly sensitive to attack because, coming from liberal roots in Seattle and admiring the European tradition of coffee houses, it is as far as it is possible for an American brand to be from the myopic idea 'we're just here to make money'. </p> <p>Starbucks has always had a commitment to exist for the wellbeing of all the communities it relies on - particularly its own people in retail outlets, the farmers in developing countries and the communities around its shops. </p> <p>The cynical will say it does this for a reason. And indeed it does because Starbucks believes in its brand. In many ways it is the quintessential brand of the modern age, creating and fulfiling a demand for a product that we could all do without - except that the real product is not a drink made from roast beans but a place to go, meet friends, talk, daydream, have meetings, relax, hang out. </p> <p>Where Starbucks has been less than quintessentially modern is in that it has been hopeless at spin. It has always had a good story to tell but has rarely managed to tell it. Despite this, Starbucks has continued to grow because people continue to enjoy the the product and the brand experience - and to tell other people about it. </p> <p>The origins of Starbucks go back to Seattle in the early Seventies. Three college friends came together to form a business because they loved coffee and wanted to educate other people about it. If Howard Schultz had not come across them at the end of that decade, Starbucks might never have spread beyond the Pacific coast of America. Within a few years the New Yorker Schultz had taken control of Starbucks and started to develop it outside the Seattle region. But he based his ideas on what he had seen and loved in Italian coffee bars. </p> <p>In particular he saw Starbucks as 'the third place' - not work, not home, but containing elements of both, and a refuge at times from both. Starbucks was about 'rewarding everyday moments', a place to go for a small treat on a regular basis. This model succeeded and Starbucks grew at a phenomenal rate across the US from 1987. Now it operates in 32 countries, although it was only in 1996 that Starbucks opened its first shop outside North America. </p> <p>The speed of this development took everyone by surprise. In the UK the first Starbucks opened in 1998 and suddenly it seemed they were everywhere - an impression given by the swift acquisition and rebranding of the Seattle Coffee Company. This enabled Starbucks to enter a market just finding a new taste for coffee, with Costa, Coffee Republic and Caff\u00e9 Nero as competitors. </p> <p>We have become a coffee nation at breathtaking speed. Ten years ago you would struggle to find real coffee served in British towns. Starbucks and others have created an entirely new market for coffee-drinking. Starbucks has grown - there are now 400 UK outlets - but so have independent caf\u00e9s. Research by Allegra Strategies shows that the independent coffee bar market has been growing by 3 per cent a year since 1999. </p> <p>In this market Starbucks is the major brand. And it has become that by having a purpose that is much broader than the single-mindedly commercial. </p> <p>Its staff are known as partners, not a cosmetic term but a reflection of the unusual degree of employee involvement in the growth of the company through stock options and other benefits. But responsibility comes with that, and partners are encouraged to take active roles in local communities and good causes. </p> <p>This year, for example, Starbucks is supporting the Coffee House Challenge, a scheme to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the RSA (Royal Society of Arts), which was originally founded in a London coffee house. </p> <p>The Coffee House Challenge has seen people all around the country coming together, led by RSA Fellows, to hold debates about fostering local communities and improving the environment. </p> <p>As well as this local role, Starbucks has outstripped other coffee companies in its support for farming communities where its coffee is grown. The four big coffee companies (Nestl\u00e9, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kraft and Sara Lee) control the price of commodity coffee - generally to the detriment of farmers in the developing world. Starbucks buys only 1 per cent of the world's coffee but, as Oxfam acknowledges, its record on fair trade is good and improving, and Starbucks buys its coffee at around double the open market price. </p> <p>Self-interest and altruism are not necessarily incompatible. Good deeds help a brand because they build commitment with its stakeholders. And that makes money, as well as stronger communities.</p> <p><strong>Star quality</strong></p> <p>Six messages for other brands from the Starbucks story: </p> <p><strong>1</strong> Exceed the expectations of your own people.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Have strong values, stick to them and use them to guide decisions.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Ensure there's no gap between your brand values and your actions.</p> <p><strong>4 </strong>Keep reinventing, but never tamper with the core of what you do</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Reach out to communities through your people</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Remember that every detail matters.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 'My sister's a barista: how they made Starbucks a home from home' by John Simmons (Cyan Books, \u00a37.99) is available from bookshops.</p>",
  "<p>James Brown, the former bad boy of British publishing, is sitting in a ordinary-looking pub close to his north London home, sipping a mineral water and reflecting on his new career as a trainee television mogul. Flipside TV, the anarchic channel-surfing show he created with some media industry mates, debuted on Channel 4 last night and he's slightly apprehensive about the outrageous contribution of one of the guests, actor-cum-comedian Keith Allen.</p> <p>'I woke up this morning thinking I was going to get the sack,' he says, half-joking. '[But] it's been fine. I spoke to Channel 4, I spoke to my boss at the production company. There were more people watching our show than watching ITV. I knew we'd had good audience figs because the executive producer said \"we must get Keith to come back\". How the Muslim community take it up with Keith is a different matter.' </p> <p>For the benefit of those who were tucked up in bed when Flipside TV went out, Allen's controversial comments about Islam prompted a few complaints. But Brown is no stranger to controversy. This is the man who was famously sacked as editor of GQ for including Nazi field marshal Erwin Rommel in a list of 'style icons'. </p> <p> Flipside, a TV show about people watching TV, is a truly post-modern innovation. Guests sit in front of TV sets, remote controls in hand, and channel-hop in search of entertaining content on rival stations. The idea is that viewers can interact, turning over to watch the other side before re-tuning to Brown et al satirising rival shows. </p> <p>It started out on an obscure digital channel, Nation 217, last year, but Brown and his co-creator, former advertising executive Jay Pond-Jones of Chime, have signed a two-channel deal. It will run nightly on Channel 4 until the end of this week and also has an eight-week run on satellite station Paramount, which will screen a longer, 90-minute, version of the show. </p> <p>Brown has spent much of the past year hastily assembling the concept. 'We'd been working on it for two days and someone said \"there's a little satellite channel that wants to put it on\". We said \"when?\" and they said \"in three weeks\". So we just sort of looked at each other, laughed and said \"OK\". </p> <p>'It's two different shows. If you've only got terrestrial TV and you look at us surfing through the channels you're essentially getting a voyeuristic programme, whereas if you've got satellite you can interact.' </p> <p>Brown is taking a portfolio approach to his career after selling I Feel Good, the magazine company he founded and floated, to rival publisher Dennis in May 2003 and sitting out a year of gardening leave. He re-emerged in the magazine world last month as a hired gun at Time Out, helping founder Tony Elliott to find an editor (Observer journalist Gordon Thomson) and rejuvenate the title. 'I spent a week locked in a room with two women. It was great. By the end of the week I was menstruating at the same time as them. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it,' he says. 'I think it just helped them to have an outside voice. I'm getting to have some sort of editorial and publishing input without the stress [you endure] when you have your own company.' </p> <p>Magazines are in Brown's blood. He began his career producing fanzines in his native Leeds as a teenager before joining the New Musical Express and making his name as Loaded's founder and launch editor a decade ago. </p> <p>The 'lads' mag' market is now hugely profitable, as the success of weekly titles Nuts and Zoo illustrates. For many, Brown created the template for what followed, acting as a sort of cultural midwife to the 'new lad' phenomenon, although Loaded was written with an irony and intelligence that its imitators often lack. Does he feel responsible for unleashing a tidal wave of tits and arse on an unsuspecting nation? </p> <p>'I don't feel responsible. I like it when I get the credit for creating a genre that's worth billions throughout the world,' he says. 'But when somebody holds up a picture of Girls Aloud in bikinis and says \"you're responsible for that\", that's different. The amount of readers Loaded got, the amount of money it made, [showed] it was obviously a very good magazine. But it also allowed lots of people to come in behind it and do blander versions. I don't pick up Nuts and Zoo myself, but I understand from a business perspective how it's followed a footprint I put down. But editorially they are pretty different in the way they are presented, [although] it might not look it to the outsider.' </p> <p>If anyone has inherited his mantle as the enfant terrible of men's magazines, he says, it is newly appointed Maxim editor Greg Gutfeld, brought over from American magazine Stuff . 'He is really good. He's got great ideas. Greg will bring a little bit of the anarchy that the Loaded team and I had back in the day. He's going to inject a bit of humour.'</p> <p>The whole world knows that Brown's wild years of drug-taking, drinking and hanging out with celebrities are behind him. Was the coverage it received overplayed? 'No, it was underplayed,' he smiles, although that's about all he's willing to say on the subject. Now he's living a 'pretty normal life', doing TV in the evenings and watching or playing football at the weekends. 'I've got my media mates and I've got my normal mates who I grew up with - the guys I go to football with.' He still follows Leeds, although he's not expecting to see them return to the Premiership this year - 'not with the strikers we've got [Brian Deane and Michael Ricketts]; they move about as fast as the matchstick men in a Lowry painting.' </p> <p>He won't say exactly how much money he made from the sale of IFG, but says he could retire tomorrow if he wanted to - a lifestyle option that clearly doesn't appeal. 'I don't work just for the money. I like to do things that are inspiring.' </p> <p>More projects will follow, perhaps even a new magazine: 'The market is crowded - but then again there's loads of art and it doesn't stop the Chapman brothers making things,' he says. </p> <p>In the meantime, Brown is enjoying a change of pace. 'I've just moved house and the 15-year-old next door asked me what I did for a living. He'd seen me dossing around in the garden, kicking a football around... It's a nice way to spend a life.'</p>",
  "<p>Few household names survive four decades in the public eye without attracting their share of lampooning and criticism. Sir Terence Conran is no exception. </p> <p>He has been satirised by Craig Brown, arguably as good as a Desert Island Discs invite, as a man who takes credit for introducing the chair and the Mediterranean to our shores. His marital record has on occasion been traduced (his current wife, Vicki, Lady Conran, is his fourth) and his ex-wife, Shirley, spoke recently about his alleged shortcomings. </p> <p>Newspaper cuttings have it that he was pushed out of Storehouse, the Eighties retail group that included Habitat, Mothercare and BHS, and others omit his founding contribution to Next. The last two bother him most, but we shall come back to those. </p> <p>It is easy to see how it happens. Ask a man with so many strings to his bow and so much behind him about his life and his current projects, boil it down to a few hundred words and some of it will sound rather bald. </p> <p>The Conran name has an impact and he knows it. Although he is a friend, Sainsbury's ex-chief executive, Sir Peter Davis, did not commission a Conran range for his struggling stores as a favour. Neither did another retailer-in-recovery, MFI. Both projects have caught the City's attention, as analysts' company notes show. So Conran guards that name closely, although both of the above ventures are described as being 'franchise projects'. 'We are not in the business of selling our name,' he says. 'That is the fastest route to everlasting damnation that I can think of.' </p> <p>The 'we' is the family business. Conran has five of his own children and three step-children. Sebastian and Jasper work on design and fashion; Tom 'looks after the food side' and Sophie was a buyer for the Conran shops but 'now she is doing pies, which she thinks are the future of nourishing, cheap food'. Ned has run into personal trouble. The three younger children have had guaranteed holiday jobs working in kitchens and behind tills. </p> <p>'I do not see it as a family business. I do not feel like a patriarch. I hope in the future they will continue to be involved and perhaps more involved than they are now,' says Conran. </p> <p>It sounds contradictory and up to a point it is. Generous with his time and hospitality and unfailingly polite, there is still an unmistakable steely, monomaniacal quality. But then, thoroughly humble, selfless people with remarkably steady personal lives rarely make successful entrepreneurs. </p> <p>His home environment is tailored to his business needs and wants. On the outside, an astoundingly beautiful country estate complete with bountiful walled gardens and lovingly restored greenhouses, on the inside an efficient production operation. </p> <p>Some people have garden sheds. Conran has a furniture factory in the grounds of his 18th-century Berkshire manor house. He can be on site in minutes, strolling from the office wing of his home via the gardens. As commutes go, it is not bad. The factory is a cluster of converted farm buildings and is the heart of Benchmark, his hand-crafted furniture business. 'This is the bit I love,' he says. 'I can come down here and get my hands dirty.' </p> <p>In many ways it is an idyll. The 40-strong workforce ('more than the farm employed when it was working') is largely local, many trained from school. As a factory it is unbelievably well-ordered: not a stray crate in sight. </p> <p>The gardens recall Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit, with rows of onions and tomatoes interspersed with sweet peas, white roses and purple clematis creeping up the walls. Lady Conran emerges to collect ingredients for lunch, which will be simple, fresh andhomemade, bar the uber-chi-chi poilane bread. The Conrans know the French family who make this. The Conrans know a lot of people. </p> <p>Partly this is due to his background, educated at an English public school, Bryanston, and afterwards an integral member of the young design movement in the 1950s and 1960s (he was at school with Mary Quant's husband and designed her first shop in Knightsbridge). Mostly it is due to a career in design, retail and restaurants spanning five decades. </p> <p>His explanation of his diverse interests is an object lesson in control. 'When I started off there were really few opportunities in design. I had to become a businessman to make it happen. I was a furniture designer and we had to grab anything we could. 'I started the Soup Kitchen [in London's Strand] because I was trying to use my design talent in a variety of different ways.' </p> <p>He started Habitat because he could not find a retailer who would properly promote and display the flatpack furniture he was making. 'If you do a design job for somebody, unless they are prepared to see that everything works properly and all the staff are imbued with the style of it, it can go wrong. So often we have done shops and we go back and find notices stuck up with Sellotape. You have to give the customer confidence and so the whole environment has to be right. </p> <p>'Often the reason for us becoming restaurateurs or hoteliers or shopkeepers is because we want to have that control over the totality. This is not arrogance. It is knowing that it won't work otherwise. Clients have to work with us just as we have to work with them.' </p> <p>He does rough sketches for everything produced in his name (there are six affiliated designers at Benchmark). Looking around Benchmark, it is hard to resist the conclusion that Conran is first and foremost a shopfitter, albeit a very up-market one. The Conran design business, he says, is profitable to the tune of 20 per cent of turnover. The model is ver tical integration. The company makes, distributes and fits their work and sells to big clients such as the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland (the pavilion for the Alnwick garden) and the Swiss Re 'Gherkin', for example. </p> <p>Benchmark also supplies the Conran restaurants and shops, as does the neighbouring garden. 'We produce so much that we buy in only meat and fish for ourselves and we send two vans of fruit and vegetables up to the restaurants every week,' says Conran. Not just a pretty place, then. </p> <p>This kind of control is possible in a private company. It was less possible in the public arena, as Conran discovered at the Storehouse Group. Outsiders view the Eighties as his low point. 'The two errors about me which are most often repeated are the ones that say I was forced out of Storehouse and that George Davies founded Next,' he observes. </p> <p>Conran put together the Storehouse group in the Eighties. Habitat was his own creation, to which he added Heals and, in 1982, Mothercare. Then came BHS. 'The mistake was that it was a merger. It should have been a takeover but Ralph Halpern had his eyes on it and we would not have done the deal. It became political and the BHS people felt they were being told what to do by my side. We set up a fashion design team within our design group that really understood high street fashion. The BHS buyers felt they were being imposed on and started to resist, having started off enthusiastically. </p> <p>'One of the first things I did was get the buyers to go to America to look at Gap, to be inspired by it and to understand why Gap worked. I wanted them to get that ethic into their buying operation. I saw it as the great high street opportunity.' </p> <p>The discord leaked into the press and, says Conran, this triggered three takeover bids. 'I was not pushed out of Storehouse. I made my own decision and did it in my own time.' He details how he installed Ian Hay Davidson, a long-time business associate and personal friend, as chairman and remained on the board. 'I facilitated my own withdrawal.' </p> <p>History has not been kind, as it also fails to record Conran's version of the genesis of Next. This high street star is now generally attributed to George Davies, although when it came about in the Eighties, the Conran association was well-known. Again, Conran details names, places and events to show that the Next concept came from his design group while he was non-executive chairman. Liz Davies, then married to George, was taken on as the fashion designer. 'She had George in tow and we felt he was the ideal chap to be a merchandising director.' Conran founded Next for the parent company, Hepworths, but says when he bought Richards he had to resign the chairmanship. </p> <p>Margaret Thatcher knighted him in 1983. Habitat was internationally known. He had design books to his name and was laying the foundations for the regeneration of the southern bank of the River Thames, which was to become the thriving Butlers Wharf development, close to his London office and restaurant Le Pont de La Tour, where Tony Blair and Bill Clinton broke bread. </p> <p>There is hardly a retail name he has not worked with or for. He founded the Design Museum, is provost of the Royal College of Art and receives at least two 'kind invitations' daily to participate in various events. He has 15 franchised projects, does informal consultancy work and is about to open a new restaurant with a Cuban theme on the site of Mezzo in Wardour Street. He is 72. </p> <p>'I believe if you retire, you die,' he says, although he insists he would not be interested in buying a large high street chain. He might, however, be interested in doing something with 'cheap, good-quality food, which is where I started out'. </p> <p>Craig Brown's satire ( Private Eye , 30 April) has Conran claiming credit for everything from cushions to staircases ('those frankly very ordinary people DESERVE to be able to get to those floors they've frankly never set eyes upon'). Certainly he is often quoted saying that Habitat was instrumental in forming public taste because 'people's tastes are shaped by what they are offered'. </p> <p>It is telling that his Victorian design hero is not William Morris but Christopher Dresser, a designer who wanted his products mass-produced and had to set up a shop because he could not find suitable outlets to sell them. </p> <p>History may be somewhat more charitable than Brown and if the V&amp;A is not running a Conran exhibition in 100 years, there is always the Design Museum - which he founded - to do it instead.</p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sir Terence Orby Conran </p> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Chairman, The Conran Shop, Conran Ltd, Conran Holdings, Conran &amp; Partners, Conran Restaurants</p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> 4 October, 1931</p> <p><strong>Family:</strong> Married to Vicki; five children, three stepchildren, nine grandchildren</p> <p><strong>Home:</strong> Barton Court, Kintbury, Berks</p> <p><strong>Positions:</strong> Provost, Royal College of Art; Trustee, Design Museum</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Bryanston, Dorset; Central School of Art, London</p> <p><strong>Publications:</strong> About 30 books, including an an autobiography</p> <p><strong>Interests:</strong> Gardening, cooking, cigars</p>",
  "<p><strong> How many Ks in Dyke?</strong><br> He's not exactly Linda Evangelista, but former BBC DG Greg Dyke will not get out of bed for less than seven grand, as an email leaked to Diary on pain of death reveals. 'Greg's assuming this is a commercial thing and his fee is usually between \u00a37k-\u00a310k' writes the great man's assistant in response to an invitation to speak at a conference. Then again, Alastair Campbell reputedly charges twice that. The invitation was withdrawn.</p> <p><strong> Nutty tale</strong><br> As 'silly season-watch' moves into its fourth week, the Daily Mail delights us with a picture of water-skiing squirrel Twiggy in Friday's paper. 'She hardly ever gets her feet wet as she is towed around a six-inch-deep inflatable pool at up to 6mph' gushes the staffer assigned to pen the caption. Truly one of those word-count moments.</p> <p><strong> Maxim damage</strong><br> The war of words between Maxim editor Greg Gutfeld and GQ counterpart Dylan Jones is getting out of control. The latest edition of Maxim features a cartoon depicting the immaculately attired Jones as a 'style-obsessed shallow OAP'. Jones, who is out of the office on a Conde Nast editorial get-together, doesn't want to comment, says a spokesman. 'Maybe he's angry because we forgot to draw in a cravat?' says Gutfeld.</p> <p><strong> Difficult to Face</strong><br> Word reaches us that now- defunct style mag the Face was nearly bought by an unlikely suitor: pop impresario Simon Fuller, above. Fuller is rumoured to have held rescue talks with Emap before it was closed a few months ago. It may be just as well the talks failed. The prospect of the mag that discovered Kate Moss being run by the man responsible for SClub7 may not have been a happy one for the Face's cooler-than-thou readers.</p> <p><strong> Jobs 4 the boys</strong><br> Channel 4 has appointed mighty Swiss investment bank UBS to advise it on a possible merger with Five, as this paper reported a fortnight ago. An industry gossip reminds us that Rob Woodward, the channel's commercial director, is himself a former UBS banker. Did someone say 'jobs for the boys?'</p> <p><strong> Heavy weather</strong><br> The Government is asking licence-fee payers for its views on the BBC as part of the charter review. Judging by the corporation's complaints log, the answers may not be particularly constructive. Witness a missive from one viewer about the Six O' Clock news' weather. 'The presenter referred to forecasted rain showers as \"dreadful\". This was unfair as I believe many people enjoy rain.' Another viewer phones in to say: 'I am unhappy that Michael Fish continually swallows. It is disgusting.' With viewers like these...</p>",
  "Children as young as 14 will train to serve as judge and jury in trials of their peers, under government plans to cut inner city crime. <p>The initiative, an attempt to encourage young people to respect the judicial system, has the support of senior ministers but has alarmed some legal experts. </p> <p>The Department of Constitutional Affairs could introduce the radical scheme next year, when it pilots a groundbreaking project in Liverpool that hopes to repeat the success of initiatives in the US. </p> <p>Depending on the results of the two-year trial, the government intends to roll the scheme out across Britain. </p> <p>The Red Hook Justice Centre, in Brooklyn, New York, runs a unique adult court system which unites civil, family and criminal cases plus social service facilities under one roof. The scheme also uses a 'teen' court to handle cases of 10 to 16-year-olds accused of petty crimes such as anti-social behaviour, vandalism, drug-taking and underage drinking. </p> <p>Greg Berman, Director of the Centre for Court Innovation, which developed the Red Hook concept and is advising the British government on introducing a similar centre in Liverpool, said Britain had shown a 'tidal wave of interest' in the initiative. 'We've had visits from the Home Secretary, the Lord Chief Justice, the Attorney General and several ministers,' Berman said. </p> <p>Under the teen court scheme, which is being adopted by New Zealand, Canada and Japan, teenagers aged 14 to 17 study a number of disciplines including law and social sciences, to ensure they make fair judgments and recommend appropriate sentencing. </p> <p>Teenage jury members are selected from a variety of backgrounds and include ex-offenders. The court can also appoint teenage judges, prosecution and defence counsels. </p> <p>Sanctions at the court's disposal include compelling offenders to perform community service, write letters of apology to their victims and attend anger management workshops. Its supporters believe using peer pressure is an effective way of preventing teenagers reoffending. </p> <p>'Let's be honest, courts are ranked below banks, Congress and any other civic institution you can name when it comes to trust. This scheme tries to bring justice back to the community. It makes justice something people can touch and see,' Berman said. </p> <p>Red Hook is one of scores of youth courts in operation across the US. The first was opened in the 1980s but it was only under the Clinton administration that the schemes became established in major cities. </p> <p>Critics question the wisdom of making naturally rebellious teenagers central to the sentencing process. </p> <p>Elizabeth Gaines, executive director of US thinktank the Osborne Association, has raised fears that Red Hook leaves children with the unhealthy impression 'that the justice system is necessarily a part of their lives'. </p> <p>And one academic study found the success of 'teen courts varies considerably across the United States'. </p> <p>But Berman says more than 80 per cent of offenders complete sentences handed down in youth courts, a significantly higher proportion than under conventional sentencing. </p> <p>'When we started there was this question about whether teenagers would want to stand up in front of their peers - whether we really could activate peer pressure - but the reaction has been remarkably positive,' he said. </p> <p>The government has already pledged to introduce Red Hook's adult system in its Liverpool initiative. One judge will preside over civil, family and criminal cases offering a one-stop judicial shop, with links to social services, to tackle entrenched problems such as drug abuse and domestic violence. </p> <p>Since Red Hook opened in 2000, supporters say crime in the community has fallen. Last year was the first in four decades without a murder in the neighbourhood. </p> <p>A home office spokesman said a senior judge would oversee the Liverpool centre in the autumn and confirmed the government was studying plans to introduce peer courts to Britain. </p> <p>'Peer courts are an option we are looking at, but it will be up to the judge and local practitioners to decide whether this is a suitable option for the Liverpool project,' he said.</p>"
