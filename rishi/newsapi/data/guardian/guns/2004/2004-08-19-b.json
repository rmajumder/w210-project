  "A 13-year-old armed robber who terrorised shop staff with a sawn-off shotgun, demanding cash and cigarettes, was sentenced yesterday to a three-year supervision order. <p>The schoolboy, from West Bromwich in the West Midlands, burst into a store in the town armed with the 12-bore gun, Wolverhampton crown court heard. </p> <p>The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to charges of attempted robbery and possession of a firearm with intent. </p> <p>Judge Robin Onions told the teenager - who was just 12 at the time of the offence on May 8 this year - that he would have been sent to jail if he had been older. </p> <p>Sentencing the boy, the judge said that staff at the Your Own Shop on Oak Lane had been terrified by their 20-minute ordeal, but had shown remarkable bravery throughout. </p> <p>The boy, who sobbed when a letter he wrote apologising for his actions was read to the court by his defence counsel, Elizabeth Norman, was ordered to remain indoors between 7pm and 7am for the next three months. </p> <p>He will also be electronically tagged and subjected to 24-hour monitoring by a youth offending team. </p> <p>Describing the manner of the offence as childish in nature, the judge told the boy: \"I am dealing with a truly exceptional case, given your age. In your case, the demands of rehabilitation are far greater than the need to punish. I take the view that you didn't understand the true extent, the gravity, of what you had done. </p> <p>\"Society will be better served if you receive supervision and surveillance.\" </p> <p>The judge added that there was every reason to hope that the youth would learn from what he had done and go on to become a useful member of society. </p> <p>The court was told that the offender, who claimed to have found the weapon at the home of a family friend, was preparing to start classes at a new school. </p> <p>He is said to have kept the weapon for three weeks prior to the robbery, which happened after he was \"dared\" to commit the crime by a relative. </p> <p>A police inquiry is continuing to establish exactly how the weapon came into the boy's possession. </p> <p>The judge warned the teenager that the offence was \"not glamorous\" and that any breach of the order would result in him being brought back to the same court. </p> <p>\"Boys of your age should be off playing football rather than doing what you have done,\" he added. </p> <p>Earlier, the court was told that the hooded raider had walked into the shop and pulled out the 12-bore shotgun, which was unloaded, from under his jacket. </p> <p>Jasbir Gulliani and his father, Sudha, managed to keep him talking until police marksmen arrived and disarmed him. </p> <p>Closed circuit television footage of the incident was shown a fortnight ago during the earlier hearing. </p> <p>During the raid, the boy was told that there was no cash in the till and that he was too young to smoke. </p> <p>The court heard that he threw a bin bag at Mr Gulliani, ordering him to fill it with cash, but that the shopkeeper refused. </p> <p>Speaking outside the court, Detective Inspector Carl Southwick, of West Bromwich police, said the sentence was fair, as the youngster had been \"egged on\" by others to hold up the store.</p>",
  "Ayad Allawi's ultimatum yesterday to the rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al Sadr - who is holed up with his fighters in the holy city of Najaf - was notable for one thing: the lack of a deadline. <p>Reporters who gathered for a news conference in Baghdad were expecting the prime minister to announce that the final military push to remove Mr Sadr from the Imam Ali shrine had begun. </p> <p>But while he made it clear that the time for negotiation was over, Mr Allawi positioned himself behind the peace plan that emerged from this week's national conference, which calls for Mr Sadr to vacate the holy shrine, disarm his militia and join the political process. </p> <p>\"A solution is needed and soon, and we want to use all peaceful means to preserve the holy shrine,\" he said. </p> <p>It was an indication that the prime minister, who has been cultivating his image as a no-nonsense leader, is aware of the risks involved if he or the US forces make a false move in Najaf. </p> <p>If the plan to neutralise Mr Sadr works, Mr Allawi will then have only the insurgency in Sunni areas to worry about. If it fails, his government's aim of restoring security so that elections can be held will be little more than wishful thinking. </p> <p>For while there is little doubt that a US and Iraqi military campaign could dislodge the dedicated but poorly trained al-Mahdi fighters, the political fall-out could inflame mainstream Shia opinion, which broadly disapproves of Mr Sadr and which Mr Allawi desperately needs on his side. </p> <p>In the course of either arresting or killing Mr Sadr and his young armed followers, US and Iraqi forces run the risk of being seen as \"desecraters\" of sacred Najaf, an act that could linger in the minds of any disaffected Shia - the majority in Iraq. </p> <p>\"Anything affecting the holy shrine may result in disaster,\" said Adel al Adib, a senior official of the Dawa party, a a major Shia group which is part of the interim government. \"The reaction will last for a long time.\" </p> <p>The short-term consequences could be destabilising, too. \"It could be portrayed as the first real atrocity of the new interim government,\" Mr Adib said. </p> <p>\"Sadrists have already started likening Mr Allawi to Saddam. If the military way is the only one pursued, it could fail and the government could lose credibility, and where would that leave us on the next step to complete sovereignty? The danger is the government will indeed be seen to be doing things like the former regime.\" </p> <p>Mr Sadr, who is in his early 30s, benefits from the popularity of his father, a Shia cleric killed by the Saddam Hussein regime in 1999. </p> <p>He knows he cannot rival the Shia Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in terms of religious standing, but is vying to become the paramount Shia political power. And while Mr Sistani remains away from Najaf - he has just left hospital in London after heart surgery - there is a danger that Mr Sadr's control of Najaf will solidify. </p> <p>Whatever Mr Allawi thinks of Mr Sadr - he is variously described as unstable or stupid by government officials - he has tapped a vein of Iraqi and Arab nationalism and populism, particularly among the poor, frustrated and alienated Shia youth. </p> <p>The unrest has already prompted a number of senior Shia figures in the south to call for secession from Baghdad. </p> <p>Some foreign diplomats question whether the destruction of Mr Sadr would really have a beneficial effect. </p> <p>\"Destroying the Mahdi Army may fragment a group of youths who at least for now are under some sort of control,\" one said. \"If you remove their leadership, then the Shia resistance may get into a macho contest with the Sunni resistance over who can out bomb the other.\" </p> <p>But many agree that the costs of inaction are equally heavy. The number one on most Iraqis' wish list is security, followed by jobs, services and a chance to have a say in their own future. </p> <p>Until now Mr Allawi's unelected administration has bought some breathing space by promising a secure environment that allows the reconstruction of the country and fair elections. </p> <p>\"If the interim government cannot meet its first major challenge, then its credibility will lie in tatters,\" said a western diplomat. </p> <p>\"This is a chance for the new Iraqi state to establish the primacy of the state and the rule of law. National elections with an armed militia on the loose is unthinkable.\" </p> <p>Mr Allawi has gone out his way to open the door to Mr Sadr.\"If the Iraqi people want Mr Sadr to be their leader, they will be able to elect him,\" he said again yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Sadr refuses to recognise the interim government. But his decision this week to agree to the terms of the national conference, plus the presence of his supporters there, indicate some willingness to deal with new institutions in Iraq.</p> <p><b>Weeks of violence</b></p> <p><b>August 5</b> Gunmen attack the Najaf police station with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades at 1am.

After lobbying from the industry, however, the regulator will not require insurers to set targets limiting the amount payouts change each year. </p> <p><strong> HSBC buys into Brazil</strong><br> </p> <p>HSBC has agreed to buy the consumer finance operations of Brazil's Indusval Multistock Group for about $124m (\u00a368m).

  "Army doctors at the Abu Ghraib prison west of Baghdad falsified medical records to cover up torture and human rights abuses perpetrated on Iraqi detainees, the British medical journal the Lancet reported today. <p>It called for a full inquiry into reform of the military health system to address the failure of army medical staff to live up to their code of ethics and a professional obligation to care for their patients. </p> <p>The journal published an article by Steven Miles, a professor of bioethics at the University of Minnesota, saying that American army doctors and nurses had been fully aware of torture and degrading treatment at Abu Ghraib, but did not blow the whistle before an official inquiry began in January. </p> <p>He said their neglect of the commonly accepted standards of human rights included: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Failure to maintain medical records, conduct routine medical examinations and provide proper care of disabled or injured detainees; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Medical personnel and medical information were used to design and implement psychologically and physically coercive interrogations. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Death certificates and medical records were falsified. </p> <p>An example of the ethical failings of medical personnel came in November 2003 after Iraqi Major General Mowhoush's head was pushed into a sleeping bag while interrogators sat on his chest. </p> <p>Dr Miles said: \"He died; medics could not resuscitate him, and a surgeon stated that he died of natural causes. Months later, the Pentagon released a death certificate calling the death a homicide by asphyxia.\" </p> <p>In an editorial comment, the Lancet called on health care workers who had witnessed ill-treatment at Abu Ghraib and Guant\u00e1namo Bay to break their silence. </p> <p>\"Those who are still in positions where dual commitments prevent them from putting the rights of their patients above other interests should protest loudly ... </p> <p>\"The wider non-military medical community should unite in support of their colleagues ... Abu Ghraib should serve as an eleventh-hour wake up call for the western world to rediscover and live by the values enshrined in democratic constitutions.\" </p> <p>It said military doctors had a well recognised problem of dual loyalty to patients and employers. </p> <p>Dr Miles added:\"Army investigations have looked at a small set of human rights abuses, but have not investigated reports from human rights organisations, nor have they focused on the role of medical personnel, or examined detention centres that were not operated by the army. </p> <p>\"The US military medical services, human rights groups, legal and medical academics, and health professional associations should jointly and comprehensively review this material in light of US and international law, medical ethics, the military code of justice, military training, the system for handling reports of human rights abuses, and standards for treatment of detainees. </p> <p>\"Reforms stemming from such an inquiry could yet create a valuable legacy from the ruins of Abu Ghraib.\"</p>",
  "It took just two hours for the jury to give 27-year-old Dion Coleman 45 years to life for the murder of 23-year-old Walter Holley. And, beyond their immediate families, the story of how two poor young black men's lives were ruined over a row about a counterfeit $50 note would have ended there were it not for the one wealthy black woman on the jury. <p>For this was Oprah's trial. And as she emerged from the court room to announce that she had invited all of her fellow jurors on to her show next week, she intended to keep it that way. </p> <p>She was, of course, keen to play down her role in the whole affair, holding an impromptu press conference outside the courthouse to say that she should not be the centre of attention and that celebrities should not be picked for juries. \"It is very distracting to have people who are known who are serving on the jury,\" she said as she stood alongside her fellow jurors and a book agent outside the courthouse. \"This is not good for the victim's family. A man has been murdered. This is not about Oprah.\" </p> <p>But this was very much about Oprah. Mr Holley's murder had received no press attention at all and the trial would have gone the same way had the queen of the televised confessional not been selected for jury service. But, with her presence, the press coverage included her failed quest to find a breadless turkey sandwich at the courthouse cafeteria and the court-provided meal of jerk chicken and scalloped potatoes on Wednesday. </p> <p>\"It's a huge reality check,\" said Winfrey after the verdict. \"There's a whole other world going on out there ... when your life intersects with others in this way, it is forever changed. I heard this would be a jury of one. We were a jury of 12 and we came to the decision that the defendant was guilty.\" </p> <p>Irene Holley, the mother of the murdered man, was not upset by the media circus. \"I wasn't thinking about any of this - the media, the cameras, Oprah Winfrey,\" she said afterwards. \"I was thinking about justice. I'm glad [the cameras] were here. Maybe the real story might not have been told.\" </p> <p>However, Lorraine Coleman, the mother of the murderer, believes it made a difference to the verdict. </p> <p>\"It wasn't a fair trial,\" she said. \"They focused on Oprah instead of my son. I don't watch her show anyway. I watch Montel. And Maury.\"</p>",
  "A few hundred metres from a line of American tanks, Riyadh Aabid pointed yesterday to the bullet hole in his shop. <p>\"This is a pointless battle,\" he said. \"The Mahdi army attacks the Americans from inside the houses. And then the Americans attack the houses. But it's innocent civilians that get killed. Both sides claim they are right. But both are wrong.\" </p> <p>In Sadr City, Baghdad's teeming slum which is home to two million Shia, there was little sign yesterday of the previous night's battle, when the US military launched its biggest incursion into the maze of narrow alleys and dusty roads. </p> <p>Outside Mr Aabid's softdrinks shop, a couple of black goats grazed on a mountain of rubbish. Around the corner, a serried line of American tanks stood in the fierce afternoon sunshine. A short drive in the other direction, past a tangle of twisted cars and smouldering barricades, a solitary Mahdi army fighter armed with a Kalashnikov stood on a corner. </p> <p>It is here that support for the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr appears at its most fervent; dozens of young men have already gone to Najaf to defend the Imam Ali shrine; others have stayed put to ambush the Americans here. </p> <p>The US military claimed it had killed 50 Sadr fighters in overnight fighting. According to Mr Aabid, however, most of the victims were ordinary people like him. Nobody knew how many had died. </p> <p>\"My two children couldn't sleep. I held both of them in my arms all night. They were trembling. The American bombs were so loud,\" he said. \"Our message to the Americans is 'stop shooting into houses. Unarmed people live there'.\" </p> <p>But Mr Aabid and other Sadr City residents said they were as fed up with the Mahdi army, whose hit-and-run tactics invariably lead to a disproportionate US response. </p> <p>\"We hated Saddam. But in the Saddam era we didn't have bullets being fired into our shops. The only gunfire was at wedding parties,\" he said. </p> <p>While the battle between the Mahdi army and the US forces has been portrayed as an epic struggle against foreign occupation, other residents said the problem was more basic: a lack of jobs. </p> <p>\"The only employment round here is to be a policeman, soldier or a dustman. I believe that if the government provides jobs then the Mahdi army will simply throw away their weapons. They'll pick up shovels instead,\" Fadhil Jasim, 35, said. </p> <p>Nearby, dozens of posters of Mr Sadr were plastered on unpowered street lights; black Sadr flags fluttered from the roofs. Virtually all of the shops were boarded up. No women could be seen. </p> <p>Few residents were prepared to criticise the cleric's militia directly, but there were oblique stirrings of discontent. </p> <p>Ra'ad Khalaf, a 24-year-old shopkeeper, said he was a supporter of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most revered Shia cleric, who has called for the fighting in Najaf to stop and is in hospital in London. </p> <p>Lieutenant Colonel Lopez Carter, commander of the US battalion that led yesterday's operation, said his troops had \"thrown the Mahdi army off balance\".</p>",
  "The Israeli Likud party has once again performed what might seem the impossible task of making Prime Minister Ariel Sharon appear moderate in comparison. The vote against his efforts to form a coalition with the Labour party follows Likud's rejection in May of Mr Sharon's plan to withdraw unilaterally from Gaza. Indeed, during the debate on Wednesday, Mr Sharon insisted he was acting for the good of Israel and that his opponents were \"extremists\". His aides say he plans to press ahead without the support of Likud, possibly by wooing the religious Shas party and with the implicit support of Labour. But critics of Mr Sharon's own aggressive brand of politics, which has done so much to ratchet up the Palestinian crisis, may well ask what sort of moral ground he occupies. <p>In the shambles of what remains of the peace process, Mr Sharon's Gaza proposal has been reluctantly accepted by the UN secretary general and other international players as better than nothing, though it is a unilateral step which - if carried through - would risk leaving the larger problem of the West Bank permanently unresolved. This week the other side of Mr Sharon's implied bargain was spelled out, when plans were announced to accelerate the expansion of settlements in the West Bank by building an extra 1,000 houses for settlers. This follows the announcement earlier this month of 600 additional units in Ma'ale Adumim. In spite of Israeli quibbles over the wording of the UN security council's 1967 resolution 242, the settlements already breach international law, and any planned expansion breaches the road map for peace. Washington's initial low-key response to the latest announcement (the State Department said it wanted to \"speak privately\" to Israel) bears out claims by sources close to Mr Sharon of a secret understanding with the Bush administration that its protests will only be muted and pro forma. </p> <p>Meanwhile, what of Yasser Arafat, whose own failings of leadership are the despair of independent and thoughtful Palestinians and have aroused increasing anger on the streets of Gaza that challenges his position. Though his character defects go back a long way, the efforts of the Sharon government to isolate Mr Arafat and render even his faltering efforts to curb terrorism useless have had their desired effect of emasculating him. Yet he is still the elected leader of the Palestinians - in this respect enjoying comparable legitimacy to Mr Sharon. Mr Arafat on Wednesday told Palestinian legislators in Ramallah that some \"mistakes have been made\", though he disappointed efforts to extract any more specific pledges. It was at least a first step in the right direction, although the Palestinian people, as foreign minister Nabil Shaath commented, are \"waiting for more specifics\", and attempts to get Mr Arafat to sign decrees backing specific measures were rebuffed. </p> <p>The Israel-Palestine situation grows ever worse while attention has been fatally diverted by the war in Iraq and the subsequent occupation. There is no magic answer, of course, but international diplomacy must re-engage and - regardless of who may win or lose in the political battles within Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - continue to press for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine based on the internationally accepted pre-1967 borders.</p>",
  "<p>War first came to prominence through their collaborations with Eric Burdon, but as this double-disc flashback makes plain, Burdon's involvement only lasted for a couple of albums. After that, the squad of school friends from the rough LA districts of Compton and South Central pursued their own hybrid of funk, jazz and latin music, and scored a fat streak of hits before ennui and line-up changes started sapping their energies at the end of the 1970s. Their signature hit Low Rider remains the epitome of greasy LA funk, while The Cisco Kid was a pivotal moment that earned them a commercial bridgehead into the Hispanic audience. Their jazzy instrumental City, Country, City is loathsomely smarmy and River Niger sounds like background music from the original Starsky and Hutch, but Cinco De Mayo and the ballad Don't Let No One Get You Down have barely dated.</p>",
  "<p>Listening to Jill Scott makes most of what currently passes for soul music seem one-dimensional. She doesn't just have a voice, she has multiple voices, ranging from an impeccably swinging jazz register to a soaring, operatic soprano. As a lyricist, she can be earthy and she can be ethereal, often at the same time. No other contemporary soul artist would think of describing sex as \"a poignant rocking back and forth\".</p> <p>It has been a long time since her 2000 debut, Who Is Jill Scott?, made her a star. Since then she has married, and two years ago she left her native Philadelphia for New Jersey. In 2001 she released an album of live material and out-takes, but afterwards decided to take a break, concentrating instead on her new-found domestic bliss. For a while it seemed she might not make another record at all.</p> <p>\"There was no urge to write anything,\" she says. \"There was just an urge to live, visit, hang out, get drunk, talk shit, have fun. So that's what I did. And I got a cat, and she's great. I love her, she's my baby. Ten months go by, and I'm like, OK, do you want me to do anything? A full year went, and suddenly it was shaking me. The lyrics started to come. They were very forceful, waking me up, getting on my nerves, stopping me - I burned so many of my good pots, trying to cook and something would come. I did two albums, I think. About 60 songs. Some of them are very sassy, very rough, very mmmm, you know? Then some of them are very contemplative and introspective. This record is very different from what's been and what will come.\"</p> <p>Released later this month, Beautifully Human is more uniform in tone than its predecessors, but it's never monochromatic. It's gentle but full of nuance and subtle dynamics; relaxed, but deceptively so. \"This record is not immediate gratification,\" Scott admits. \"It's one to spend time with. Not 'the bass is hot' or 'that beat is hot'.\"</p> <p>The album revels in the intimacy of domestic life, from the food at a family reunion, to the shifts, compromise and, ultimately, profound pleasures of a relationship. \"There's so many heartache songs, so many I'm strong by myself, I don't need anybody' songs,\" she says of current R&amp;B. \"It's either love or hate. It's extreme. And the good stuff is in the middle. That's where this record is. It's very much human.\"</p> <p>Such was her sense that she had specific points about life and love to make that Scott frequently refers to the album as \"the project\". \"The first album,\" she says, \"I listened to Sarah Vaughn and Biggie Smalls. This one I listened to Frankie Beverley and Minnie Riperton. Frankie Beverley - 'There's a time in your life when you know who you are, that's the golden time of day.' That's just, ooh! Minnie was a very powerful writer as well. She sang about love in a way that I try to: I feel like this and I can't control it but it's good.\"</p> <p>It's clear that for Scott, the word has primacy. Rarely in any genre does an artist appear who seems in kinship with both Walt Whitman (in Still Here she declares \"I am a wealth unfathomed\") and Cole Porter (the classically elegant couplet in Spring Summer Feeling: \"It's no surprise that my knees weaken/ From the lovely words you're speaking\"). </p> <p>Though she had always sung, it was poetry that first truly gripped her. \"Jehovah's Witness bible stories. The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison. Ooh, yeah, that was a big one,\" she says. \"But the poet that really got me - I was in eighth grade [14] - was Nikki Giovanni. We had been reading poetry in school and it was cool, it was interesting, it was nice. But when I got to her, it was so black, it was so me, it was my experiences. She talked about sitting between your grandmother's legs getting grease and water on your hair. What? That's me. Sonia Sanchez, Gwendolyn Brooks, Maya Angelou. I'd had no idea that this stuff was even out there.\"</p> <p>She was initially a performance poet on the Philly cafe scene (her first book is published next April). Singing she kept private. \"I didn't want anybody to hear it, 'cos it was mine and I didn't know what was gonna happen when people heard it. I knew how it made me feel. I was nervous that something was gonna happen, that people were gonna change because of it. I hid it for a long time. Through being on stage with just a book and myself and some words, one day a song came out. It was Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. The response was so much better than I expected, so I thought, OK, nothing bad happened. Just crying and smiling, that's good.\"</p> <p>As a singer, what Scott wants to do most is communicate. \"The recorded version is just a tool so people can learn the lyrics,\" she says. \"Then we get together live, which is a whole different animal, and we can sing it together. Live there's a certain amount of freedom and passion - not to say I can't do that in a recording, but this one was more about lyrics than anything else.\"</p> <p>Live, Scott is a force of nature. The day after the interview, in an unusually intimate venue in downtown New York, she gives songs from the new album a different life: confrontational and full-blooded. \"I chose a softer voice in order to be heard,\" she says of the record. \"I understand that particular tactic with my husband and certain friends - sometimes you have to maintain low tones to get a point across. But live, I'm giving them me, all of that, because I want that much in return. It would be easy to do the album version live - it would be very soft, very pretty.\"</p> <p>The show is, at its least, soft and pretty - and at its most, intensely moving - during Rasool, a song about a neighbourhood kid from Scott's childhood who was shot during gang violence: \"the first death I'd seen\". Powerful in itself, it becomes a requiem just when you think the song might be ending. The band plays on while Scott prompts the audience, encouraging: \"And ... and ...\" Slowly, then in a rush, people call out in remembrance of those they have lost, the names rising from the crowd like a collective prayer.</p> <p>\"I left it open for them to call out names,\" Scott says. \"I try not to tell people what to do. I like them to figure it out for themselves.\"</p> <p>In fact, Rasool fits perfectly into the album's subtle polemic, because what Scott is advocating is a deeper, more responsible, more all-encompassing sense of family. Her own childhood was marred by a violent stepfather, yet she seems remarkably undamaged. \"He was not nice, and when he drank, it was worse,\" she says, simply. With minimal fuss, her mother protected her as much as possible. \"That's why I love the strength of women,\" Scott says. \"She would slide me into my uncle's house.\" There, she bore witness to a real, loving family. \"And I had an awesome grandpa, and he loved his wife, and sometimes as a child I'd walk in on them and they'd be kissing, oh! I mean kissing!\"</p> <p>Obviously she doesn't subscribe to the idea that contentment doesn't inspire great art, that \"happiness writes white\".</p> <p>\"No, but I've thought about it. What do you think? Is [happiness] dull?\" She fixes me with a look, a wonderful mixture of playfulness and provocation. It's a rhetorical question, clearly. \"I write what I write because I want people to feel not-alien. If you're not just in love but willing to go through the highs and lows because of that love, then I want people to know they're not alone. And this,\" she says of her marriage, \"is good. This is really good. I always knew it was possible, I just had to be patient - which I really wasn't. Waiting for the right one, I kissed a lot of frogs.</p> <p>\"I don't wanna sound too mushy,\" she continues, \"and I don't do it all the time, but sometimes I just look up at the sky and ... \" Wordlessly, infinitely quietly, she makes a gentle, awestruck sound that suggests absolute joy.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Beautifully Human is out on Hidden Beach Recordings on August 30</p>",

  "A private engineering consortium which maintains two-thirds of London's tube network has been attacked for poor management and for flouting safety regulations in an official report into a derailment at White City station. <p>Metronet, which looks after nine tube lines, was accused yesterday of failing to implement special safety checks of points at the scene, despite being ordered to do so after an earlier accident at Camden Town. </p> <p>The investigators' severe criticism of Metronet is likely to reawaken controversy over the government's public-private partnership (PPP) on the tube. The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, has suggested that the structure poses risks to the travelling public. </p> <p>The report examined the derailment of a Central line train carrying 150 passengers over a set of points at White City in May. Although nobody was injured, the mishap caused concern among unions because it was the sixth such derailment in two years. </p> <p>Investigators said Metronet ought to have imposed a 10mph speed restriction and daily checks on the points. The measures were mandated in 42 locations in an enforcement notice after last year's Camden Town accident, which left seven people hurt. </p> <p>\"There was a lack of thorough understanding of the criticality of the measures needed, a lack of management control over the distribution of critical information and a lack of supervision to ensure that those measures were being implemented effectively,\" the report concluded. </p> <p>Under the PPP, the government handed 30-year leases over the infrastructure of the tube network to two firms - Metronet and Tube Lines. The day-to-day running of trains and stations remains in the hands of London Underground, which is controlled by the mayor. </p> <p>A Metronet spokesman admitted that the company had been at fault in the derailment: \"We have accepted fully the fact that our internal procedures have not been satisfactory.\" </p> <p>The Transport Salaried Staff Association said the debacle revived concern over the fragmented management of the tube. Its general secretary, Gerry Doherty, said: \"It is unacceptable that derailments such as this occur even though specific safety measures are in place. This is not helped by the complex structure of London Underground and the tangled lines of communication between the infrastructure controller and the contractors.\" </p> <p>LU's service director, Nigel Holness, said the PPP partners would work closely together to learn the lessons of the derailment: \"The report pulls no punches and has identified that Metronet's failure to fully comply with measures set out by LU was the principal cause of the derailment.\"</p>",
  "If peace ever comes to Colombia after decades of civil war, it will come too late for three citizens of the oil-rich north-east region of Arauca, on the border with Venezuela. They were murdered by the army on August 5. The men were all trade unionists, and their killings bring to 30 the number of unionists killed in Arauca so far this year. <p>I met the men on a recent visit to Saravena, a town in Arauca at the epicentre of the government's security policies. Armed soldiers stood on every street corner. At a packed meeting, they and other trade unionists described the conditions they had struggled with after the President Alvaro Uribe designated their area a special security zone. Armoured cars cruised past the building, as though warning those inside that we were all being watched. </p> <p>The stories they told were of mass arrests, kidnappings, intimidation and murder. On one occasion, in November 2002, more than 2,000 people were rounded up at gunpoint and taken to the sports stadium where they were interrogated, photographed and marked with indelible ink. Hooded informers pointed out individuals, who were then arrested. The codename for this mass abuse of civil rights was Heroic Operation. </p> <p>Heroic Operation was an army undertaking, but civilian authorities cooperated: officials from the attorney general's office issued arrest warrants on the spot, on the word of the informers rather than any judicial investigation. Of the 2,000 rounded up, 85 were arrested. They were taken into detention, during which some were told they would be released if they agreed to become informers. Months later, 35 had been released for lack of evidence. When they finally returned home, many faced death threats from paramilitary groups. About 40 of the 50 who remained in detention were trade unionists. </p> <p>The returnees talked of the harassment they endured and the alarming death rate among civilians in Arauca who assumed any position of leadership. Teachers, health workers and union activists were being killed in appalling numbers. The latest three victims were prominent local union officials. The government claims they were guerrillas, but two had been under the special protection of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. </p> <p>Why has Arauca been singled out for \"enhanced\" security? One answer is oil. It is home to the Ca\u00f1o Lim\u00f3n oilfield, which accounts for 30% of Colombia's oil production. The oil is pumped to the Caribbean through a pipeline that has been a major target for guerrilla forces. Now a complex mosaic of armed groups - rightwing paramilitaries and the army, often working closely together, and leftwing guerrillas - struggle for control of the lucrative pipeline and cocaine routes. </p> <p>The civil war is decades old but has grown more complex in recent years. Uribe was elected on a promise of security. The civilians of Arauca - farmers, oil workers, health workers and their families - bear the brunt of the conflict and need peace more than anybody, but for them Uribe's promises have proved hollow. The reality of the security zones poses the question of whose security they are designed to enhance. </p> <p>There are seven municipalities in the department of Arauca, but the special security zone was only imposed in the three northern municipalities where the oil pipeline runs. The four municipalities to the south are dominated by illegal far-right paramilitary groups, notorious for their abuses of the civilian population - but they were excluded. The supreme court ruled the security zones unconstitutional because of the extraordinary powers they gave to the security forces, but that did little to change the facts on the ground. Now they are designated rehabilitation and consolidation zones - little more than a change in name. </p> <p>These are tough times in Colombia and the government argues that tough measures are necessary. But key officials who look at whether these measures work point out that they are counterproductive. The Colombian human rights ombudsman and the procurator general reported that not only did human rights abuses increase, but the security situation in Arauca deteriorated after the special security zone was set up. There was a documented increase in abuses by the army and paramilitary groups, with no decrease in the danger to civilians posed by the guerrillas. </p> <p>The procurator general's report on Arauca said: \"Neither the increase in military personnel, the strategy of informers or that of peasant soldiers has had the expected results. On the contrary, they have led to other difficulties [such as] the exposure of the civilian population to greater risk.\" </p> <p>It may be a different matter, of course, for an oil company. Occidental Petroleum, which operates in Arauca, has funded the army's controversial 18th Brigade, the main army force in the department. The US government also funds the 18th Brigade, apparently unconcerned that it has been accused of abuses against civilians and of cooperation with paramilitaries. </p> <p>Last year, the US gave Colombia $99m to protect the pipeline, to be split between the 18th Brigade and a new mobile unit. President Bush also sent 60 US special forces personnel to Arauca to train the brigade. Given this involvement of the oil companies and the US government in the brigade's activities, perhaps they can explain something the Colombian government does not care to: how does it enhance the security of the people of Arauca when the army, directly or through its collaboration with paramilitary groups, targets health workers, trade unionists, teachers, journalists and human rights defenders and forcibly displaces indigenous and peasant communities who lived near the pipeline?</p> <p>A year ago, in a meeting in London, Colombia's vice-president signed a commitment to implement a long list of recommendations from the UN Human Rights Commission. Twelve months on, the UN reports that there has been almost no progress on most of the recommendations, and on others Colombia has moved backwards. The Colombian government claims that the vice-president's signature did not commit the country to anything - an approach to commitments that Colombia's partners might care to bear in mind in future dealings with the Uribe government. </p> <p>Uribe denounces the UN view as foreign interference in Colombia's affairs. Human rights organisations - including Amnesty International - that protest against army abuses are labelled terrorist sympathisers by the president himself. At the same time, Colombia hopes for other kinds of foreign interference - the kind that pours money into military coffers (as Britain does through bilateral military aid) and no-questions-asked funding and investment. The people of Colombia need investment, but more urgently they need a security policy that genuinely enhances their security. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:isabel.hilton@theguardian.com\">isabel.hilton@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday vowed to press ahead with his plan to withdraw Gaza's Jewish settlements, despite his defeat at the hands of his own party on Wednesday. <p>A statement from his office said: \"The prime minister is continuing with the disengagement and the diplomatic process. He will find a solution to the problem. He will try to build a stable coalition government.\" </p> <p>On Wednesday, the Likud central committee voted on a resolution that barred Mr Sharon, who is on holiday, from asking the Labour party to join his coalition government. Committee members believe Mr Sharon will use the Labour party to outflank his own party in implementing the disengagement plan, which they rejected in May. </p> <p>The prime minister is not bound by the decisions of the central committee and is still supported by the majority of the party's Knesset members. </p> <p>But senior members of the Labour party said they should pull out of coalition negotiations because Mr Sharon had become a \"lame duck prime minister\" and call for early elections. </p> <p>Under Israeli law, the president must consider if there is another candidate who might stand a better chance of creating a coalition. Mr Sharon is unlikely to give his rival, Binyamin Netanyahu, such an opportunity. </p> <p>A second scenario is the failure of the Knesset to pass the budget within a certain period of time. If that occurs, the president is obliged to call an early election. </p> <p>Mr Sharon received some good news yesterday when the supreme court backed the decision of the attorney general not to prosecute him on corruption charges. The prime minister was investigated for giving political favours to a man who then gave his son large sums of money for a very small amount of work, but the attorney general decided that there was not enough evidence to continue the inquiry. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Palestinian militants fired five homemade rockets from the Gaza Strip at the Israeli town of Sderot yesterday, wounding a 10-year-old boy, Israeli rescue workers said. More than 30 other people were treated for shock. </p> <p>Israeli soldiers shot dead an 18-year-old Palestinian in the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, witnesses and hospital officials said. Two other Palestinians were wounded.</p>",
  "Ariel Sharon may have lost Wednesday's vote on Likud's central committee over whether Labour should join Israel's ruling coalition. Ultimately though, either the rebels bow to the prime minister's stronger will, or the rightwing Likud party will lose power and also lose the settlements in the occupied territories that Sharon's opponents are trying so hard to preserve. Likud might even lose Sharon himself. <p>Settlements and Sharon have been entwined for decades. But no more. As his showdown with his party proves, Sharon is serious about disengaging from Gaza and part of the West Bank. Now, for the third time in three years, his party has rebuffed him on a major policy issue. For Sharon, the party is becoming a nuisance, not an asset. If the rebels keep winning, Likud may break up; and the pressure for Sharon to create a new alliance with the centre - or even a new party - may become unstoppable. </p> <p>Abroad, Sharon is considered a hardline ideologue of Greater Israel. The reality is different. Although Sharon is the architect of settlements and of the Likud party - which he helped establish in 1973 - his background is not in the old Israeli revisionist right, as are those of a number of the key rebels. </p> <p>In fact, Sharon's roots lie with the revisionists' old ideological enemies: the hawkish but pragmatic tradition of Israel's Labour movement. His commitment to settlements, as well as to Likud, was always about security: a means to achieve a thriving Israel, safe in a hostile Middle East for generations to come. His quest for secure borders certainly does not match Palestinian aspirations; but he is not driven by a dogmatic and uncompromising attachment to the land. </p> <p> In 1982, as minister of defence, Sharon ordered the bulldozers to level Yamit, the last Israeli settlement in Sinai, to fulfil Israel's obligations under the Camp David accords with Egypt. It took him time to become persuaded of the agreement's enduring nature. But once he embraced it, no amount of pressure from the settlers, who had formerly seen him as their staunchest ally, could budge him. It is the same with his commitment to disengagement and national unity: Sharon has made up his mind. A Likud standing in the way might soon become an impediment to be removed, not a force to be reckoned with. </p> <p>And so Likud's central committee may come to regret having defeated and humiliated Sharon yet again. After all, this is not a clash within a nation divided. Sharon has the solid backing of the public. The rebels thrive on the illusion that the sharp reduction in terror attacks plays in their favour. They are wrong: the public, including most Likud voters, supports Sharon precisely because he wants out of Gaza. Over 60% support disengagement and a national unity government that includes Labour; 61% feel secure in their daily lives and approve of Sharon's security policies. But a reduction of terror is not enough: Israelis want a political horizon, not a dead-end. That involves the \"painful concessions\" Sharon has evoked since his election. </p> <p>Sharon, for his part, has learned two lessons in his long political career: never fight a war with a nation divided and Labour in opposition, or without American support. Today, he has a nation largely united behind him, and firm US backing. He is not going to let Likud's hardliners undermine either by preventing Labour from joining him. </p> <p>The Likud party loves self-inflicted pain: Wednesday's vote was an act of political suicide. But Sharon is not Likud and Likud is not Sharon. Before the year's end, expect a showdown. Either Sharon will have relegated his opponents to irrelevance, or he will have relegated Likud to history. The Likud rebels' opposition to his disengagement plan is a rearguard battle of a defeated ideology against the political realism of a rightwing leader who understands the difference between ideological dreams and what can be achieved in the current political reality. </p> <p>Sharon's defeat may give his opponents an ephemeral victory but, ultimately, Israel's choices today are not between a two-state solution and the vision of a Greater Israel. They are between Sharon's plan and Yossi Beilin's Geneva accords, which would take Israel back to its 1967 borders and, from Likud's perspective, open the way to the large-scale return of Palestinian refugees. </p> <p>In 1998, Israel's nationalist right punished Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's double \"sin\" of withdrawing from most of the West Bank town of Hebron and signing the Wye River agreements with Yasser Arafat by toppling him - only to get a Labour government. Today's rebels face a similar choice: neutralising Sharon's plan will only bring Israel's defeated left back to power. Theirs is the fate of ideologues: they might rule the central committee, but they have lost the people. Sharon knows that. That's why his defeat is only temporary. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Dr Emanuele Ottolenghi teaches Israeli politics at Oxford University </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.emanueleottolenghi.com\">www.emanueleottolenghi.com</a></p>",
  "<p>JJB Sports rocked the City yesterday by issuing a profit warning that it blamed mainly on England's washout weather. </p> <p>Shares in the company immediately plunged 19% to 176p after it predicted full-year profits would come in 20% lower than the \u00a388m analysts had been expecting. </p> <p>The share price collapse is a particular blow to the majority of investors who rejected a 280p tender offer from the firm in February. The Euro 2004 football competition had allowed JJB to kick off the summer well, bringing big sales of England replica kits. </p> <p>But yesterday the Wigan-based firm revealed that turnover for the 29 weeks to August 15 was down 2% on last time and that like for like sales had slumped by 5%. </p> <p>This was almost double the decline reported on July 9 at the annual meeting. </p> <p>Sales had been hit more recently by \"the unseasonably wet weather which has resulted in lower sales volumes of JJB's summer clothing products such as t-shirts, polo shirts and shorts\", it said. </p> <p>But JJB admitted there had also been \"strong competition\" in the market, which industry experts attributed to discount retailers and supermarkets muscling in on goods such as tracksuits and trainers. </p> <p>The company insisted it was continuing to benefit from strong cashflow, which would fully fund its expansion into a new concept of combining health clubs and superstores. </p> <p>Chief executive Tom Knight said the company would be looking hard at costs but there was no question of shop closures. \"This is a company that still has sales of \u00a3750m to \u00a3800m and will have profits of \u00a370m. We have just got to knuckle down,\" he explained. </p> <p>The surprise announcement came as a bombshell to analysts who have spent the past couple of months feeling confident about prospects for the stock. </p> <p>On July 5, analyst Rod Whitehead at Deutsche Bank increased his investment recommendation from add to buy and set a new higher share price target of 320p. </p> <p>Numis Securities had been using a price target of 330p but said it had now cut this back to 210p. </p> <p>Yesterday the Deutsche analyst defended that decision, saying the target he set was still lower than many others. </p> <p>\"They [JJB] have had a pretty disastrous six weeks and they assume it's going to stay tough. It's mainly the weather, but this is a very fast-moving industry,\" Mr Whitehead said. </p> <p>The profit warning also rebounded on sentiment towards other retailers with John David Group - the owner of the JD Sports chain - seeing its own shares falling by 8.5%. There are now fears that a cool July and rainy August will also have had a negative impact on other clothing retailers, such as Matalan. </p> <p>After spectacular success in its early years, JJB has been going through a much more difficult period. Chief executive Duncan Sharpe - the son-in-law of the group's chairman and founder David Whelan - took his own life in the autumn of 2002. </p> <p>Last summer Mr Whelan made a proposal to take the company private at 220p a share, but this was rejected by a majority of the board and withdrawn. A tender offer at 280p per share in February was taken up by only 3% of the company's investors. </p> <p>By yesterday's close the share price had recovered from its worst level, ending 33.75p down at 183.75p.</p>",
  "<p>As residents were allowed back to inspect their ruined homes, the Prince of Wales visited Boscastle yesterday and made a \"substantial\" donation to the village's disaster relief fund. </p> <p>Interrupting a holiday in Scotland, he flew to Cornwall to inspect the flood damage in the Cobweb Inn and around the village, before praising the emergency services' operation. </p> <p>After a 15-minute briefing from police officers, firefighters and coastguards in the operations centre set up in a doctor's surgery, he said: \"Well done, you are amazing.\" </p> <p>Told about the seven helicopters which rescued nearly 120 people from their flood-stricken homes after the torrential rain on Monday afternoon, he said: \"Thank God for the helicopters.\" </p> <p>And he praised the \"speed, professionalism and bravery\" of the rescue teams. </p> <p>His spokeswoman said the prince was making a \"substantial donation\" from a Duchy of Cornwall fund to the relief fund set up by villagers. </p> <p>Collecting tins are appearing in neighbouring villages as a wave of sympathy sweeps across north Cornwall. </p> <p>Building inspectors continued to check the safety of the dozens of buildings damaged by the flash floods and a wall of water three metres (10ft) high which swept through the village. </p> <p>Large metal detectors were delivered by helicopter to help search the mud for cars and other wreckage. </p> <p>Although some residents were allowed back to see if they could salvage any belongings it is not known how long it will be before they can go home permanently. </p> <p>Carrying a rucksack and shoulder bag packed with essentials, including medication, Mary Sharp, 70, said she had been surprised and relieved to find her harbourside home virtually bone dry. </p> <p>\"We saw these cars go past like a duck race - they came bob, bob, bob down the river. The roar and the smell was horrible. </p> <p>\"We got out, but we've just been very fortunate. There was not a speck of water in our house. We are very grateful.\" </p> <p>Like many others she and her husband Don are staying with another villager. </p> <p>After a private 20-minute meeting with residents, the prince said in a statement: \"All I can say is how much admiration I have, not only for their astonishing resilience but also for the selfless and remarkable way in which they have dealt with this disaster. </p> <p>\"I do hope ways can be found in which we can help people to recover from this awful experience and to rebuild their lives and homes as quickly as possible.\" </p> <p>George Findlay, a handyman who chairs the parish council, said the prince was \"in total shock and awe of everything that had happened\". </p> <p>\"[He] could not really believe the water had been 10ft deep, cars had gone out to sea like toys, and yet there had been no loss of life. </p> <p>\"I think everybody would like to see him come back some time in the future when things get better, and perhaps open one of the new buildings - we are going to have to have some new buildings.\" </p> <p>Another visitor, the Liberal Democrat MP for North Cornwall Paul Tyler, promised to keep the government to its promise of providing financial assistance to rebuild Boscastle. </p> <p>As loss adjusters began assessing the millions of pounds of flood damage, he said it would be difficult to decide what was the responsibility of insurance companies and what the government and local authorities should pay for. </p> <p>\"I hope we will find the insurance companies will be as accommodating as the government is promising to be.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The holiday industry is our meat and drink. If we can't show tourists there is something for them here next year, then we will be in difficulties.\"</p>",
  "Li Peng, the former Chinese prime minister dubbed the \"Butcher of Beijing\" for his role in the Tiananmen Square crackdown, is trying to clear his name with a new essay that shifts some of the blame on to his political master. <p>After 15 years of vilification as the leader who declared martial law and ordered in the tanks, the most unpopular man in China has declared he was merely an apprentice following the wishes of the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. </p> <p>\"In the spring and summer of 1989, a serious political disturbance took place in China,\" wrote Mr Li in the monthly magazine Seeking Truth. </p> <p>\"With the boldness of vision of a great revolutionary and politician, comrade Deng Xiaoping - along with other party elders - gave the leadership their firm and full support to put down the political disturbance using forceful measures.\" </p> <p>For such a senior figure, it was a rare public reference to one of the darkest chapters in the history of the Chinese Communist party, when People's Liberation Army troops killed hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators in and around Tiananmen Square on June 3 and 4 1989. </p> <p>With many of today's leaders implicated, the massacre is the most politically sensitive topic in China. Despite calls from victims' families for an investigation, media discussion of it is almost taboo. </p> <p>But Mr Li, who stepped down from his final government post last year, has more reason than most to want to reopen debate. In the eyes of most Chinese, the 75-year-old is primarily responsible. </p> <p>In the protest before the crackdown, thousands of students and citizens in the square chanted the slogan \"Li Peng must step down\". As premier, he was blamed for scheming to undermine Zhao Ziyang, the moderate party secretary general who argued against the use of force. </p> <p>According to leaked \"Tiananmen papers\", Mr Li moved at a meeting on June 2 1989 that the square be cleared. \"It is becoming increasingly clear,\" he told Deng and other leaders, \"that the turmoil has been generated by a coalition of foreign and domestic reactionary forces, and that their goals are to overthrow the Communist party and to subvert the socialist system.\" </p> <p>After the army clashed with Beijing citizens who were trying to prevent the troops reaching the square, Mr Li called for \"decisive measures to put down this counter-revolutionary riot\". </p> <p>Mr Li has indirectly referred to the massacre in the past. Last August he published a book in which he mentioned for the first time he had been in hospital in July 1989 - prompting many sinologists to speculate that he had suffered a breakdown after the bloodshed. </p> <p>This spring, a magazine in Hong Kong reported that the communist leadership had blocked the publication of Mr Li's memoirs. According to Yazhou Zhoukan (Asia Weekly), Mr Li offered to revise his 300,000-character manuscript entitled The Key Moment, but he was still denied permission to release a work deemed too sensitive. </p> <p>Now he has used the 100th anniversary of Deng's birth as an opportunity to play down his responsibility for the three most controversial decisions of his tenure: the Tiananmen crackdown; the construction of the Three Gorges dam; and the building of the Daya bay nuclear plant. </p> <p>In a commemorative essay for Seeking Truth, a Communist party mouthpiece, Mr Li says the government's most daring policies had been initiated by his mentor, who died in 1997. He paints a picture of a relationship with Deng in which he was a timid apprentice in need of encouragement from the master. Recalling a conversation when he became premier in 1988, Mr Li wrote that Deng had urged him to toughen himself up. </p> <p>\"Comrade Xiaoping said: 'What I am worried about is that you are not bold enough to carry out your work. You have to learn hard and train yourself in work in order to make yourself more mature.'\" </p> <p>But Mr Li showed no remorse for the Tiananmen massacre, echoing only the official line that it had been necessary to put down the \"disturbance\" to ensure the stability that has underpinned China's economic growth. </p> <p>The debate is unlikely to end with Mr Li's essay. There have been calls from within the party for a reassessment of the June 4 1989. </p> <p>This year one of the most respected men in China - Jiang Yanyong, the military doctor who blew the whistle on the Sars cover-up - urged the party to reconsider the acts of the demonstrators as \"patriotic\". Dr Jiang's letter - in which he described treating the victims of the massacre - was leaked to the international media, but was never published within China.</p>",
  "Yasser Arafat yesterday made the unusually frank admission that he had made mistakes and that there had been \"unacceptable practices by me and many others\" within the Palestinian Authority. <p>Mr Arafat did not specify what the errors had been, but he said there were \"wrong practices in some institutions\", and promised a \"comprehensive workshop of reforms\". </p> <p>He did not, however, explain what these would be or when they would be implemented. </p> <p>The Palestinian leader's confession came in a long speech to the Palestinian legislative council after more than a month of discontent at the corruption in the authority. </p> <p>The demonstrations started in Gaza with a series of kidnappings and protests against Mr Arafat's appointees, and spread to the West Bank. The protesters ranged from gunmen to the Palestinian political elite. </p> <p>At a hall next to his compound in Ramallah, Mr Arafat told the council: \"We have to be brave enough to admit mistakes. There were wrong practices in some institutions, and some misused their positions. </p> <p>\"There were not enough efforts to strengthen the rule of law, the independence of the judicial institutions ... But we have begun measures to solve this. There is nobody immune from mistakes, starting from me on down. Even prophets committed mistakes.\" </p> <p>He added: \"We must open the doors wide for our young generation to seize the opportunity to serve our people.\" </p> <p>References to Mr Arafat's past and the days when he travelled the world to sign treaties dominated the speech. </p> <p>His main reference to current events was an appeal to Palestinians to support prisoners on hunger strike in a campaign for improved rights in Israeli jails. </p> <p>Though the speech was short on detail, Khalil Shiqaqi, a Ramallah-based political scientist, said Mr Arafat would have to institute reforms: \"Arafat has survived by being in touch with the Palestinian street. He realises that there is a unanimous consensus for reform and he cannot be outside that for long. </p> <p>\"He will therefore throw them a bone soon.\" </p> <p>But Mr Arafat's statements appeared to irritate many members of his audience, some of whom have clamoured for reform of the PA since it was formed 10 years ago. </p> <p>Abdul Sawad Salah, a mem ber of the PLC for Ramallah, interrupted Mr Arafat, shouting: \"You are protecting the corrupt.\" </p> <p>Mr Arafat replied he was protecting all Palestinians, including the corrupt. </p> <p>After the meeting Mr Salah said Mr Arafat had not said anything new to address the concerns of the Palestinian people: \"He just spoke about general things and the past and mouthed slogans. He thinks he can continue with this and cheat the people. </p> <p>\"I planned to tell him that there is a new intifada approaching, directed at the Palestinian Authority unless it is mended and renewed with new elections.\" </p> <p>Ziad Abu Amr, a PLC member from Gaza, said he had heard Mr Arafat's expressions of remorse and failure before but he not seen him do anything to rectify his mistakes. </p> <p>\"This speech is only significant if it is followed up by a process of exercising accountability. If not it is just talk.\" </p> <p>He said the PLC had sent a letter to Mr Arafat asking for a series of reforms, including changes to the cabinet and the security services, and the imposition of the rule of law, but they had all been ignored. </p> <p>\"The PLC will meet tomorrow and my guess is that we will not have seen enough and we shall insist on some changes,\" he said. </p> <p>Hannan Ashrawi, a PLC member for Ramallah, said that, in her experience, Mr Arafat had shown two characteristics: a desire to avoid change until the last possible moment; and the ability to do just enough to defuse a potentially explosive situation. </p> <p>\"It remains to be seen whether this time he will go beyond that and institute reforms in an organised way rather than a sporadic and isolated fashion,\" she said. </p> <p>The PA has been dominated by Mr Arafat and his personal style of government. The system lends itself to corruption and inefficiency, although Mr Arafat has always led a frugal life and demonstrated devotion his role. </p> <p>The Israeli attacks and the closure of PA areas has led to a weakening of authority and a deepening of corruption and inefficiency. The problems have proved beyond Mr Arafat and his colleagues from the days of the PLO's exile in Beirut and Tunis. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Arafat was flanked by Ahmed Qureia, the prime minister, who threatened his resignation last month because he was unable to achieve anything. </p> <p>At one point, Mr Arafat turned to Mr Qureia, saying: \"My brother, my historical comrade, you have all my support for the work of your government.\"</p>",

If he places a \"maximum bid\" then the system will automatically bid by proxy up to his maximum.

  "Eight terrorism suspects charged with conspiracy to murder and to launch radioactive, chemical or explosive attacks were remanded in custody amid high security at their first court appearance yesterday. <p>The defendants, all Britons, were arrested in a series of raids two weeks ago and will appear again at the Old Bailey in London next Wednesday. </p> <p>Three members of the alleged conspiracy, who are accused of holding documents including \"reconnaissance\" plans of the New York stock exchange, the International Monetary Fund in Washington, banks in New York and New Jersey, and recipes for explosives, are also charged with offences under the Terrorism Act. </p> <p>The men appeared yesterday morning before Bow Street Magistrates Court, sitting at Belmarsh. They were charged on Tuesday afternoon having been questioned for a fortnight, the maximum allowed period, even with the permission of the courts. </p> <p>Relatives and friends sat in the public gallery as the defendants, each dressed in grey jogging trousers and white T-shirts or sweatshirts provided by police, made their brief appearances before district judge Timothy Workman. </p> <p>They appeared in the dock in small groups, for just under ten minutes at a time, and spoke only to confirm their names and give their dates of birth. Each was escorted by two officers in body armour. </p> <p>Sue Hemming, for the prosecution, gave brief details of the case against the men, who are alleged to have conspired with unknown others. </p> <p>Abdul Aziz Jalil, 31, from Luton, Bedfordshire, was the first to be led into the dock. He sat alone as the clerk told him that he faced charges of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to commit a public nuisance by using radioactive materials, toxic gases, chemicals and/or explosives. Both charges were brought under the Criminal Law Act 1977. </p> <p>Nadeem Tarmohammed, 26, from Willesden, London, appeared next. He faced an additional charge of possessing a \"reconnaissance\" plan for the Prudential Building in New Jersey in the United States which was \"likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism\". </p> <p>He was followed by Zia Ul Haq, 25, from Paddington, west London, and Qaisar Shaffi, 25, from Willesden, north west London, who appeared together. </p> <p>They were read the same conspiracy charges and Mr Shaffi was also accused of possessing an extract from the Terrorists' Handbook, which contained information on preparing chemicals and other explosives, again said to be of potential use to terrorists. </p> <p>Mohammed Naveed Bhatti, 24, of Harrow, Middlesex; Omar Abdul Rehman, 20, of Bushey, Hertfordshire; and Junarde Feroze, 28, of Blackburn, Lancashire, were read the conspiracy charges. </p> <p>Dhiren Barot, 32, from Willesden, was then read two further charges under the Terrorism Act. The first was that he had \"reconnaissance plans\" for the New York Stock Exchange, the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC and Citigroup in New York and two notebooks with information on explosives, poisons and chemicals. The second was that he possessed the plan of the Prudential Building with Mr Tarmohammed. </p> <p>The defendants had been brought from Paddington Green police station in west London, where they had been held for the last fortnight, in two convoys, each of which was shadowed by a helicopter. </p> <p>Following the hearing, a spokeswoman for lawyers representing six of the defendants read a prepared statement outside court. </p> <p>\"The charges will be fully contested and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage,\" said Kirsten Johnson. \"We invite the press to respect the privacy of all the families of the young men we represent both at home and at work.\" </p> <p>Mudassar Arani, the solicitor representing all of the men bar Mr Bhatti and Mr Rehman, said a formal complaint had been made about police treatment of the defendants. </p> <p>She said their spectacles had been taken away, preventing them from reading the Koran. They were returned several hours after she complained. </p> <p>Ms Arani added: \"The officers have stated the reason their spectacles were taken away was for safety reasons. </p> <p>\"That cannot be correct - for 12 days they were allowed to wear them and they were not considered a safety threat.\" </p> <p>A ninth man, Matthew Monks, 32, from Sudbury, London, appeared in court on his own earlier charged with possessing an illegal firearm. </p> <p>He pleaded not guilty and was granted conditional bail. His passport will remain with police and he will report to them. He will appear at Bow Street magistrates' court in London on September 29. </p> <p>The other four men arrested on August 3 have been freed without charge or questioned over non-terrorist related offences.</p>",
  "<p>\"We may not be winning gold medals in Athens. But medals for heroism are certainly due after the devastation of Boscastle,\" gushed the <strong>Sun</strong> in the aftermath of flash floods that swept through the seaside Cornish village on Monday. Stories detailing the heroism of both local people and the emergency services filled the pages of yesterday's papers after hundreds of stranded residents were successfully rescued. </p> <p>The extent of the damage was only apparent when the water subsided on Tuesday. \"Sleepy Boscastle looked like a war zone,\" said the Sun. \"Cars crushed like matchsticks lay buried in the harbour, their twisted wheels poking through the mud.\" </p> <p>The flood \"shows the destructive power of Mother Nature and the equally remarkable strength of ordinary people\", noted the <strong>Daily Mirror</strong>. \"We live in an age when we like to think it is possible to control most things,\" the paper continued. \"But there was no controlling [the wave] unleashed by freak weather over Boscastle. The result could have been a serious loss of life.\" </p> <p>The \"heroic endeavours\" of the RAF and Royal Navy, in working \"unstintingly to bring hundreds of people to safety\", comforted the <strong>Daily Express</strong>, which was also encouraged by the spirit of the rescue. \"It is easy to be cynical about modern life, to believe that courage, selflessness and valour are things of the past. Well, we have seen with our own eyes that they aren't.\" </p> <p>For the <strong>Independent</strong>, there were other lessons to be drawn. \"If only we could apply the same spirit of discipline ... to, for instance, hospital hygiene, substandard housing and lawless streets, some of this country's most intractable problems could be solved,\" the paper sighed. </p> <p>Amid the optimism generated by the success of the rescue operation, there were fears that the flood was due to climate change. \"There is a warning here that needs to be heeded,\" observed the Independent. The catastrophe was \"probably the sort of peril that our low-lying British Isles may have to get used to\". </p> <p>But the <strong>Daily Mail</strong>'s science editor, Michael Hanson, concluded that such views were misguided. The Boscastle deluge \"was by no means unprecedented\", he said, and \"our weather is no more capricious than it ever has been.\"</p>",
  "<p>Service Pack 2 for XP is far more than the usual collection of updates and bug fixes: it's a major update to Windows XP, designed to improve security, with new features and updated core system binaries. It could all add up to a 272MB download, depending on how many updates you've already made to your system. Do you want to install something that will change your system that dramatically? </p> <p>While it's rash to make any predictions about security, Microsoft has done more than just patch holes this time. Group manager Rebecca Norlander explains: \"We decided we needed to think differently about security. How could we turn this into a chess game where we were able to set up a strategy that would help us long term, cut down on the number of immediate exploits, or at least give us more time to patch or fix the software or the holes that are found with safeguards in place?\" </p> <p>Making big changes to email and browsing security, enabling hardware memory protection, and blocking more network attacks should protect PCs without relying on new anti-virus signatures or updates to protect against specific exploits. For example, the security features in SP2 block the Bagle virus with two separate warnings. But the changes mean that software that uses the old, less secure, configuration options can have problems with SP2: this is the first time Microsoft has made security more of a priority than backwards compatibility. </p> <p>Microsoft has been urging software developers to test their programs with pre-release versions of SP2, to find out if they need changes. As Paul Randle, the UK Windows client product manager, puts it: \"Some ISVs have been pro-active, others less so: people move at different paces.\" </p> <p>There have been rumours that some of the delay in shipping SP2 was down to software companies asking for more time to make changes. Microsoft hasn't found any major applications that have problems, and few users are reporting trouble. But some programs will need updates, and others will need some settings changed within Windows. Microsoft's website lists about 200 programs, including Microsoft applications and third-party software, that need you to configure the Windows Firewall (which is now switched on by default) to work the way they used to. The list includes web servers, remote desktops, file-sharing applications (including sending files via instant messaging), FTP clients, multimedia streaming software, email notifications, systems management applications (including anti-virus servers that update desktop PCs), and multi-player games. In some cases - such as Visual Studio.net and Systems Management Server 2003 - you will have to open ports in the firewall to enable options such as remote debugging. </p> <p>Web-based applications that use pop-ups will have them blocked by Internet Explorer. Remote desktop connections are blocked by default, even if the PC was configured to allow them before. The messenger service (rarely used for anything except pop-up ads) is turned off. And while File and Printer Sharing is enabled by default on PCs that are members of a domain, it's off by default if they're in a workgroup. It's easy to configure all the options via Group Policy, once you know which options you need. </p> <p>The new Security Centre in SP2 uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to keep track of whether the Windows Firewall is on, whether your antivirus software is up to date, and when you last scanned your system. Most anti-virus software will need an update to provide this information, and Norton has an update for Norton AntiVirus, Norton SystemWorks, Norton Personal Firewall, and Norton Internet Security that's available via LiveUpdate. </p> <p>On a PC that is connected to a domain, you get a different view of the Security Centre, without the colour-coded alerts or the option to change update, firewall and anti-virus settings. </p> <p>That some programs run into problems with SP2 may be good news for business users. DivX codecs (including DivX Pro and Dr DivX) don't work and don't show up in the list of available video formats, because they're writing into areas of screen memory that are covered by the Data Execution Prevention feature designed to protect against buffer overruns. Peer-to-peer file sharing tools such as BitTorrent are affected by the new limit on incomplete TCP connections, which is there to stop flood attacks. If the program tries to open more than 10 connections that don't receive the final acknowledgement from the machine they're connecting to, it will have to wait until one of them times out. </p> <p>But if blocking notorious spyware and bandwidth-filling peer-to-peer software is a welcome side effect, make sure aggravated users don't follow the instructions that are being circulated for disabling Data Execu tion Prevention or increasing the connection limit to 50. </p> <p>A few users have found that SP2 can slow their machines, perhaps because it turns services back on that might have been disabled, or because it leaves some hard drives heavily fragmented. (If so, defragmenting the drive will speed it up again.) Most reports are that Windows runs faster. This is a side effect of recompiling the code with the latest optimising compiler for security reasons. </p> <p>There are some minor issues with hardware. You need to uninstall any existing third-party Bluetooth configuration tools before installing SP2 and then repair your Bluetooth devices. There also seem to be problems with the FireWire 800 drivers included with SP2, which downgrade the speed of the FireWire port; re-installing older drivers should fix that problem. </p> <p>Randle points out that despite the changes you may need to make, SP2 is designed to make life easier for IT managers. \"Our design goals were: raising the level of security; and mak ing that manageable. All the options can be configured and managed through Active Directory and policy, and a lot of them can be scripted.\" </p> <p>You can also deploy pre-configured versions of SP2 via SMS or Software Update Services, although not all pre-release versions of SP2 can be upgraded, so allow time for uninstalling and reinstalling on test systems. </p> <p>Randle is confident that businesses will find it worthwhile. \"There's work to be done with SP2 for enterprise customers, but for the benefits you get, it's worth that work.\" </p> <p>Next week, XP Pro PCs that receive Automatic Updates will start downloading SP2 in the background. You can block that while you plan your deployment by changing a Registry key or a Group Policy setting, and there's a tool to do that on the Microsoft download site. But the Registry key fix will only work until December 14: after that, any PCs using Automatic Updates will download SP2 anyway. </p> <p>But unless a major security hole shows up in SP2, you won't want to wait that long.</p>",
  "<p>Is your company's IT strategy in line with its business strategy, and if not, who is responsible? This is the challenge now facing many IT managers, who used to focus on technology, and now have to think about governance across the whole business. </p> <p>IT governance is a huge task, and focuses on five areas: strategic alignment, value delivery, performance management, resource management, and risk management. It involves more than technology: it's about managing people and roles to make sure that business processes are managed appropriately. It is a process that starts with the design and development of a project, and should carry on throughout its life. It means that IT management teams need to understand the business processes they help deliver, and the roles of the team members involved with each system and service. </p> <p>One approach - though perhaps only suited to the largest businesses - is to define an overall enterprise architecture, and set up a committee or \"architecture council\" to make sure that all new projects fit in with both the business' strategy and its planned technical foundations. An architecture council, made up of senior busi ness analysts and IT architects, is a place where the languages of business and IT meet, and both cultures can agree on a single message. </p> <p>The current generation of development tools allows architects to define standards for their development teams, but it's the next generation of tools that have taken the governance lesson to heart. One example is Microsoft's forthcoming Visual Studio 2005 Team System. </p> <p>One of the issues facing IT departments is the number of people involved in a project: business analysts, architects, operations, testers and, of course, developers. Team System is designed to reduce the complexity of the development process by bringing team members into a single collaboration and communications framework. A single portal links all the members of a project team, while familiar tools allow everyone from a project manager to the operations team to work together. </p> <p>Methodologies are an important part of a well-governed development project, whether they're complex Prince-driven systems (the UK government approach named from PRojects IN a Controlled Environment), or streamlined agile methodologies such as extreme programming. Team System is designed to make sure that all the requirements of the chosen methodology are used. </p> <p>The package will ship with a methodology based on Microsoft's own Solutions Framework, but it's possible to build your own methodologies into the package, including coding and testing standards. A key feature is work item tracking. This allows architects and analysts to define just what needs to be done before any code can be checked into a development repository. It's not just code tests that are required: project documentation, or review cycles for architecture and project planning work also need to be tracked. </p> <p>IT governance is also about implementing appropriate tools to manage your systems. The right management tools should help teams deliver flexible responses to rapid changes in business circumstances. </p> <p>Process-based system management such as BMC's Business Server Management tools mean that businesses can align systems management priorities with business objectives. For example, it's important to make sure that the servers that add the most value to your business operations have the highest priority, and that IT is ready to add more capacity when it is needed. </p> <p>Other tools help manage the outside-facing systems, making sure that web servers are available at all times. But management isn't just about ensuring availability. The DVLA is using Tibco's BPM solutions to manage its systems, to help it respond to freedom of information requests, and to ensure data protection compliance. </p> <p>It's also important to ensure the integrity of business information. Too many organisations have too many pools of information, often duplicating content. It's difficult to know where the most relevant piece of information resides, and just what to trust. Now businesses are starting to consolidate data, make sure it is clean, and define master sources for all their key information. </p> <p>Another side of the governance equation is making sure that users behave appropriately online, and avoid any resulting entanglements with the law. The latest security tools help by monitoring network connections, which allow administrators to identify security breaches and violations of company policy and regulations. Other tools monitor email, seeking to ensure regulatory compliance. </p> <p>Finally, IT governance is about more than being on top of what the business systems are doing, and who's doing what in the IT department. It's about developing processes that are in tune with the business needs, so that IT systems deliver services to the business in a way that's possible to measure the value they add. The problems are as much about people and processes as they are about tools - and it's an area where there's unlikely ever to be a one-stop solution.</p>",
  "Maoist rebels cut off Nepal's capital Kathmandu yesterday in their first blockade of the city since the rebellion to overthrow the constitutional monarchy and set up a communist republic in the world's only Hindu kingdom began eight years ago. <p>Television reports said two highways linking Kathmandu with the rest of the country were deserted, and drivers are staying off roads. </p> <p>But the Nepalese army told reporters it was still in control. \"We're escorting vehicles and have deployed more troops to patrol the highway,\" said Brigadier Netra Bahadur Thapa, about 20km (12 miles) south of Kathmandu. </p> <p>\"This call for a blockade is some kind of propaganda to scare people. There is no violence so far.\" </p> <p>The city of 1.5 million has stocks of food and petrol for about two weeks, a government official told Reuters. There were warnings of spiralling prices as residents started hoarding goods. As Kathmandu valley has no rail links, its population depends on trucks for supplies. </p> <p>Earlier this week Maoists told 10 of the country's biggest businesses to close. Those that chose to shut included a plant run by Coca-Cola, a tobacco operation partly owned by British American Tobacco and a five-star hotel invested in by the Nepalese royal family. </p> <p>The Maoists are demanding the release of detained guerrillas, a probe into the alleged killings of activists and information about thousands of their \"disappeared\" comrades. </p> <p>Last year Amnesty International raised concerns about the Nepalese army's counter-insurgency operations. </p> <p>A statement on behalf of the Maoist leadership said the blockade would continue until their demands were met. </p> <p>Wedged between India and China, Nepal is well known as a trekkers' paradise, although large parts of the countryside are engulfed in a bitter \"people's war\". Until now, Kathmandu has been spared much of the violence. </p> <p>More than 10,000 people have been killed in the insurgency that has wrecked the already impoverished economy. </p> <p>Britain and America have poured aid and arms into the country. </p> <p>The Royal Nepalese Army, which is controlled by the king, has received $22m (\u00a312m) from the Americans. In 2002 Britain donated two Russian helicopters. </p> <p>The monarch, King Gyan-endra, ascended the throne in 2001 after almost the entire royal family was slain by a drunk and drugged crown prince. </p> <p>He adopted a hardline approach to dissent and toppled governments at will.

  "<p>Program trade or bid approach? That was the question some of the City's smartest dealers were grappling with late yesterday following some curious share movements in the FTSE 250 index. </p> <p>For days now there has been talk among the more experienced players in the Square Mile that something is brewing outside the FTSE 100. While nobody has been able to come up with a story, market professionals have been on the look-out for anything unusual. </p> <p>There was understandable excitement, therefore, late yesterday when a number of mid-cap bid candidates suddenly spiked higher. </p> <p>The most eye-catching move came from construction group <strong>Amec</strong>, which from nowhere suddenly surged 20p, or 7%, to close at 295p. </p> <p>As regular readers will be aware Amec has been the subject of bid speculation in the past couple of weeks. The story - which has never gone away - has been that an American rival is stalking the company and had approached several of its biggest shareholders to see if they would be prepared to accept an offer of 400p a share. </p> <p>Newspaper publisher <strong>Trinity Mirror</strong>, 42.5p higher at 659p, also stood out, however - as did radio company <strong>GWR</strong>, 10p stronger at 240p. Both are expected to be involved in some form of corporate activity in the near future. </p> <p>GWR, for instance, is widely thought to be considering a merger with <strong>Capital Radio</strong>, off 3.5p at 406p, while Trinity looks ripe for a break-up from a venture capitalist. </p> <p>But with recent poor performers such as fashion retailer <strong>French Connection</strong>, up 15.25p to 397.25p, and <strong><a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a></strong>, 3.75p higher at 121p, also appearing on the FTSE 250 leaderboard, traders said it was hard to tell if a deal was about to break or if prices had been boosted by a big program trade. </p> <p>Nonetheless, the mid-cap guessing game did provide an interesting diversion to another turgid session in the wider market. </p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> closed 3.5 points lower at 4,355.2, which was not a bad performance considering 10 blue chip stocks, including <strong>Abbey National </strong>, down 5p to 581p, <strong>Barclays</strong>, off 11p at 513p, <strong>HSBC</strong>, 5.5p cheaper at 820.5p, and <strong>Prudential </strong>, 6p lighter at 427p, went ex-dividend. </p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 250</strong> index gained eight points to 5,916.1, while the <strong>FTSE Small Cap</strong> index eased 2.2 points to 2,430.7. Market turnover was again poor, with a little more than 2bn shares changing hands, </p> <p>In the bond market, gilts finished in positive territory as short sellers closed their positions after the minutes from the last meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee revealed that they did not consider increasing interest rates by half a point. The benchmark, 10-year gilt closed at 100.370, yielding 4.952%. </p> <p>Royal ratcatcher <strong>Rentokil Initial</strong>, off 3.5p at 153.5p, was the day's biggest blue chip faller, rocked by reports that claimed next week's strategic review will stop short of rec ommending a break-up of the company. All of which came as no surprise to market professionals, who have believed all along that the strategic review undertaken by Rentokil's new chairman, Brian McGowan, would prove to be something of a damp squib. </p> <p>Indeed, German bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein hinted at the reasons on Tuesday, when it reiterated its sell recommendation on the stock. \"The key to Rentokil is not the 'non-core' divestment potential, it is the core itself. Margins are under severe pressure in pest control and hygiene and disposals only make the core issue greater,\" it said </p> <p><strong>Bunzl</strong>, the packaging specialist, was also under pressure after Deutsche Bank slapped a sell rating on the stock.

  "<p>School pupils are being warned they risk damaging their future career prospects as this year's A-level results show teenagers increasingly rejecting modern languages and physics in favour of so-called \"soft\" subjects, such as psychology and media studies.</p> <p>Headteachers, language teaching bodies and the Institute of Physics (IoP) said the continuing steep decline in German, French and science subjects would narrow students' job opportunities and earning potential, as well as harming the economy.</p> <p>They warned pupils were choosing A-levels they thought would secure them high grades and a university place rather than thinking longer term about their career options.</p> <p>The \"very worrying\" fall in language learning would also reinforce perceptions of the British as a nation with little interest in speaking modern languages, said David Hart, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers.</p> <p>Figures published today by the Joint Council for Qualifications show the proportion of students taking German A-level was down 8.1 percentage points on last year, with just 6,390 candidates taking the exam across the UK, while French was down by 2.5 percentage points, with 15,149 candidates.</p> <p>German showed the third biggest fall in any subject, and French the ninth.</p> <p>Science subjects were also on the decline, with physics dropping 6.2 percentage points.</p> <p>The IoP blamed poor careers advice in schools for the drop-off in the subject. </p> <p>It's chief executive, Dr Julia King, said: \"Students who take physics at A-level enjoy higher salaries in later life and have a much wider variety of career options open to them - yet physics is in decline and other subjects, such as media studies and art, are increasingly popular despite the poor career prospects they offer. It's a crazy situation.\"</p> <p>Students needed to \"balance their current interests against their future employment prospects\", she said.</p> <p>The fall-off in physics could make the subject \"the new Latin\", in danger ultimately of disappearing altogether, said Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers.</p> <p>Only computing and information and communications technology A-levels fell faster down the popularity league than sciences and German - a trend interpreted by some as a sign that IT has now become such a mainstream skill learned at an early age in school that fewer pupils feel the need to specialise in it after 16.</p> <p>While sciences and languages are frequently regarded as demanding A-levels, those subjects racing up the popularity table are mainly the non-traditional courses dismissed by critics as \"soft\", though maths, and further maths, also showed increases.</p> <p>Law, psychology and media studies continued a marked rise - particularly among girls, prompting concerns over persistent gender segregation. However, religious studies showed the biggest leap, up 13.8 percentage points - a change tentatively put down by heads to a growing interest in faith and world religions amid a rise in Islamist terror threats.</p> <p>A Church of England spokesman said the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington and their aftermath was \"undoubtedly an element\" in the boom in RE, but said the increase was partly down to a huge rise in the numbers taking the subject at GCSE.</p> <p>The plummeting popularity of modern languages is expected to be reflected in GCSE results, out next week, which will reveal for the first time the impact of reforms allowing pupils to opt out of languages at 14. After a period of stability, the numbers taking the subjects will show a decline, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>Theresa Tinsley, of CILT, the national centre for languages, said pupils were not receiving adequate guidance over the career benefits of language skills, with many falsely believing linguistic ability was useful only for those working abroad or as translators. CILT will next month launch \"Languages Work\", a series of materials intended to promote the benefits of languages.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Association for Language Learning, representing more than 5,000 language teachers, said the fall in the number of French and German A-level candidates did not reflect a drop-off in interest, but showed students opting for so-called \"softer\" subjects.</p> <p>\"Students think it is easier to get higher grades in other subjects and they are selecting in a very tactical way,\" she said. \"We are living in a sort of high grade culture.\"</p> <p>Teaching unions also raised concerns over the sharp gender segregation between A-level subjects, with girls clustering in subjects including psychology and sociology, while boys were more likely to study computing, physics and maths.</p> <p>The deputy general secretary at the Secondary Heads Association, Martin Ward, said girls gained 24,000 more A grades than boys - partly reflected by the greater number of girls taking A levels than boys - but noted that a quarter of the extra were accounted for by psychology alone.</p> <p>The Fawcett Society, which campaigns for equality between the sexes, said subject segregation led to career segregation, reinforcing women's clustering in lower-paid occupations.</p> <p>The general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, Steve Sinnott, said: \"The continuing imbalance in the proportion of boys to girls taking subjects such as computing, physics and maths remains a cause for concern.\"</p>",
  "<p>So you are about to be a student. Best time of your life, etc, etc. But it is also a time when money is tight and most freshers are taking control of their own finances for the first time. So it is important, amid the partying, to keep a grip on what you have and how you spend it.</p> <p>There are a few must-dos before setting off to university. First, get your student loan - unless you are in the happy minority whose parents can and will fund you without help - and any other support to which you are entitled. For 2004-5, the maximum loan amount for a student living away from home is \u00a35,050 in London and \u00a34,095 elsewhere, but the actual amount depends on personal financial circumstances. The Student Loans Company (SLC) website, <a href=\"http://www.slc.co.uk\"> www.slc.co.uk</a>, has a calculator to help you work out what you can expect.</p> <p>The first stage of a loan application goes through your local education authority (LEA), for English and Welsh applicants; the Student Awards Agency in Scotland; or the Education and Library Board in Northern Ireland. They send out an application form, which must be returned to them. Alternatively, you can do it online at <a href=\"http://www.studentfinancedirect.co.uk\"> www.studentfinancedirect.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>You should ideally have made contact back in March, and financial forms must have reached LEAs by the third week in June for a loan to be available at the start of the academic year. Applications must be made within nine months of the start of the academic year, although the SLC will extend this in exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>The LEA will calculate your eligibility for help with tuition fees and living costs, and a copy of this is sent to the SLC. You just fill in the back of the notice to apply for a loan, and the SLC will set up a loan account. It will also organise direct payment to the university of any help you are entitled to with fees. Loans are paid in three instalments, usually by electronic transfer, though sometimes initially by cheque.</p> <p>Second, open a student bank account. Annie-Marie Blake, head of student banking at NatWest, says: \"The good news for students is that we as banks are very keen to ensure that they have their accounts with us.\" Today's students, she points out, are tomorrow's doctors and barristers, and will be fruitful customers as, on average, graduates earn rather more than non-graduates.</p> <p>This keenness manifests itself in a range of perks, from incentives such as free railcards to longer-term benefits. The obvious one to think about right now is the interest-free overdraft. With banks falling over themselves to offer better deals than their rivals, it pays to spend some time picking the right account. \"I went with Lloyds as I already had an account with them,\" says Neil Carter, who has just finished his degree in French and German at Exeter. \"But I'd say definitely check out different offers.\"</p> <p>According to John Blake, president of the Oxford University Student Union, the Co-op is \"the bank of choice if you want - as many students do - an ethical investment bank for your money\". He adds, however: \"If you are not bothered, shop around to see which deal fits you closest. But always ensure that there is a large interest-free overdraft available: even if you don't end up living constantly overdrawn, you'll need the wriggle room to cover rent cheques or house deposits if you live out.\"</p> <p>Once you've picked the right bank, you can apply in branches or online. Banks will generally require proof of ID and address, as well as proof that you are (or are about to be) a student - a letter from the university, for example. Make sure you agree an overdraft as soon as possible, as charges can be heavy on unarranged borrowing.</p> <p>Third, pay your fees. For 2003-4 the maximum was \u00a31,125, and up to 60% of students should, according to the Department for Education and Skills, receive some help with this (see <a href=\"http://www.aimhigher.ac.uk\"> www.aimhigher.ac.uk</a>). The financial notice from the LEA will explain how much you need to pay, and you are expected to do so through the university.</p> <p><strong>To work or not to work</strong></p> <p>Even with a loan, the unhappy reality is that many students will need extra money. Says John Blake: \"It is impossible to envisage any student who could survive on just what is presently received from the SLC.\" Again, some fortunate students will be funded by parental largesse, but for many work is the only option.</p> <p>Neil Carter worked in vacations to boost his income throughout his time at Exeter. Most, if not all, of his contemporaries worked at some point, either in holidays or in term time. According to fellow Exeter student Liz King, who has just completed her second year of a drama degree, it might be possible to live on loans \"if you are really careful\", but that could mean giving up on going out, buying books and other such necessities of student life.</p> <p>Working part-time in term-time is no easy task, as it cuts down on the time you have not only for academic work but also for valuable extra-curricular activities - sports, drama, the student newspaper, and so on. Not to mention, of course, socialising. \"I did work in term-time for the first term of this year,\" says King, who worked Fridays and Saturdays in a cafe-bar, found it \"OK for about a month\" and then struggled to fit it in with rehearsals and other commitments.</p> <p>Bear in mind that some universities frown upon mixing studies and paid work. \"Oxford students are strongly discouraged, and in some colleges forbidden, from working during term-time,\" says John Blake. But, he adds, about a fifth of students still do it. According to Carter, working in term-time was the exception among his contemporaries, but not unheard of. \"Up to eight, 10 hours a week is OK,\" he says, \"but after that it is a real struggle.\"</p> <p>A job in the holidays is the more common, and more realistic, option, although John Blake warns that holiday work, such as writing a dissertation, can create problems with this. King does waitressing and a range of other temporary jobs in the vacations. \"By the time I finish each semester I tend to be in the negative,\" she says, \"so I work and pay it off.\"</p> <p>Ideally, a holiday job would also be career-boosting - a post abroad to improve languages, or a post in a bank, solicitor's office or similar. But more or less any job, properly written up, can boost a university-leaver's CV. Whatever job you do, remember to fill in a P38(s) so you don't pay tax on your hard-earned cash.</p> <p> <strong>Budgeting</strong></p> <p>The tricky thing for many new students is refraining from rushing out, heady with freedom and a brand new loan, to spend everything in the first few weeks. Set a weekly budget and stick to it from the beginning.</p> <p>\"I wish I'd been a bit more careful from the word go,\" says King. According to Anne-Marie Blake, student advisers at banks can help here, and will be realistic. \"We will not give silly advice like 'don't go out',\" she says. \"It is about managing money sensibly.\"</p> <p>Tempting as it might seem, steer clear of credit cards. \"Burn anything that offers you a credit card,\" says John Blake, and Carter concurs. \"I would recommend not getting a credit card as you get into more and more debt.\" King also advises getting a pay-as-you-go rather than a contract mobile, as it is all too easy to build up massive bills calling all those new friends.</p> <p>Then there are numerous ways, big and small, to save money. Stay in university accommodation as long as possible, as it is generally cheaper than private renting. Buy food in bulk with friends and cook together (and, certainly, buy food rather than eat out all the time). Buy books secondhand or get them from the library. Resist the temptation to join every university society in the first week or buy rounds all night to gain instant popularity. Use your NUS card at every opportunity to get discounts.</p> <p>Finally, if the worst occurs and you do find yourself struggling, tackle it immediately. Go to the bank to discuss an extended overdraft and for help with budgeting in the future. Go to student advice bodies, which most universities will have. Ask your parents, if not for money, which they may not have to spare, then for advice on how to manage your finances. Find out about any hardship funds the university might have, and apply for them. Above all, don't ignore it; it will only get worse.</p>",
  "<p>The proportion of passes at A-level achieved at the top A grade has edged up to 22.4% this year from 21.6% last time, making the universities' already tricky task of picking the brightest candidates for their most popular courses from the growing number with clutches of straight As even more challenging.</p> <p>If this trend continues, as it is likely to, one in four entries would gain the top grade by the end of the decade.</p> <p>But it was confirmed yesterday that details of a new scheme are being worked out by the admissions service Ucas with the exam boards' over-arching joint council, which would more meaningfully and accurately differentiate between the excellent and the very good students. The idea, not unreasonably, would be to find out which candidates are the real high-flyers and which only narrowly achieved an A rather than a B.</p> <p>There are many ways this could be done - by supplying universities with more information about the breakdown of marks, for example, or even by sub-dividing the A grade into four to create a new \"super\" grade. But despite speculation to the contrary, the latter proposal has not been officially rubber-stamped by a government-appointed working party into 14-19 education, headed by former chief inspector of schools Mike Tomlinson and due to report to ministers in October. </p> <p>Under the new-style modular system introduced in 2000, A-levels are broken up into modules or units (three for AS taken in the first year and three for A2 in the second year), which are separately graded. Only about one in 20 A-level candidates got As in each of the six modules that made up an A-level, but this information is not generally available. Ucas passes on to universities only the final grades to help them determine whether or not to confirm the offer of places on results day. Detailed information on the grades of separate modules would not routinely be passed on by the boards to students or headteachers.</p> <p>Despite the apparent urgency of the situation, it is not clear whether a new blueprint could be in place as early as next year. Universities are already dealing with the problem themselves by introducing their own entrance exams or special tests - for candidates applying to study law or medicine, for example. The government is anxious about a proliferation of different tests and has set up an inquiry under Professor Steven Schwartz, vice-chancellor of Brunel University, to look at options for a fairer and more transparent university admissions system.</p> <p>In fact, the issue has had university admissions officers and education officials scratching their heads for some time without any satisfactory resolution. The government has already rejected proposals for a new A-star grade. And a new exam, the so-called Advanced Extension Award, which was introduced by the government to replace the old \"special\" papers for the brightest students, has failed to take off. The number of entries this year were just 7,246 and the test has not been as enthusiastically embraced by schools as ministers had hoped.</p> <p>But this week the schools standards minister, David Miliband, made it clear that he strongly backed the need to recognise \"distinctive achievement\" without elaborating on which option the government favoured.</p> <p>He said in a speech: \"The answer to rising numbers of A grades is not to shift the goalposts so more people are downgraded, but instead to create new opportunities for the most able youngsters to distinguish themselves.\" </p> <p>But he also pointed out the need to put the escalating A grades into context. Last year, only 22,000 pupils out of 600,000 who took A-levels got three grade A passes. Only 40% of all youngsters actually take A-levels. \"Take a primary school class of 30 kids,\" he said. \"Only one is going to get three As at A-level.... You could ask instead - what are we going to do about the other 29?\" Good question...</p>",
  "<p><strong>Samantha Manning, 22, is studying psychology at Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College, High Wycombe</strong></p> <p>I'd always wanted to be a primary school teacher and originally I wanted to do teacher training at University College Northampton, whilst living at home. But when I got my results, I didn't have the points I needed. I panicked. I felt as if my life was over.</p> <p>One of my tutors told me about Clearing. We sat down together and looked through the Guardian listings.</p> <p>I was considering Milton Keynes because I was still thinking of living at home, but I saw that Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College was running a psychology and sociology course. I hadn't heard of Buckinghamshire Chilterns and I didn't even know where High Wycombe was, but I had really enjoyed my psychology A-level, so I thought I'd give it a go. I rang up and spoke to an admissions tutor. She asked me why I hadn't got my predicted grades. I explained what had happened, and she accepted me on the phone there and then. I was so relieved.</p> <p>My one concern was that in order to get British Psychological Society registration you have to do straight psychology. Luckily, I found it very easy to change my course once I got to Buckinghamshire Chilterns.</p> <p>I've just finished my three-year course and it really has outlived my expectations. The social life has been fantastic - I've met so many different people. And the degree itself has opened new doors for me. The developmental and social side of psychology has helped me to decide that I'd like to get into educational psychology, rather than become a teacher. I'm applying for jobs in education around Northampton, and I'm thinking of embarking on a teacher training course at Leicester.</p> <p>My advice if you don't get the results you expect is: don't panic. It's important to keep an open mind about where you're going to go, or which course you're going to do. I was planning to live at home, but I've enjoyed living away so much that not getting the points I expected was a blessing in disguise.</p> <p><strong>Katarina Tichonova, 27, is studying costume for the screen and stage at the Arts Institute at Bournemouth</strong></p> <p>I was planning to do a fashion degree, but when I found out about the course in costume for the screen and stage I really wanted to do that instead. I didn't even know the degree existed. Learning about the history of costume really appealed to me and I thought I'd meet lots of budding actors and directors, so I was very excited.</p> <p>I've just finished my third and final year, and I've really enjoyed the course. Psychologically it was difficult because I was learning in another language. I'm originally from Lithuania and I came to England a few years before I started my degree to learn English properly. Luckily, the tutors were really helpful.</p> <p>I have learnt so much . We covered the history of costume from the 16th, 19th and 20th centuries. We did lots of practical work like making hats, masks and jewellery, and fabric-dying, embroidery and pattern-cutting. And we learnt about working with different body shapes.</p> <p>The tutors encouraged us to concentrate on areas we did particularly well in, whether design or making or experimenting with fabrics and textiles, or whatever. Some people chose to concentrate on either the practical or the theoretical side, but I liked both and didn't want to focus on just one of them.</p> <p>I've enjoyed it so much that I want to carry on studying at the institute, so I'm coming back to do a part-time master's degree in September.</p> <p>I really like studying in Bournemouth - I don't have to spend time travelling because it's a small town. There are plenty of pubs and clubs. Also, it's lovely to be by the sea.</p> <p><strong>Peter Theopilus, 21, is studying artificial intelligence at the University of Derby</strong></p> <p>I couldn't decide which degree I wanted to do and put English as my first choice and computing second. I didn't get the grades to do English, so I came to Derby to do digital entertainment. I did the course for a year, by which time I knew it wasn't right for me. I found it a very boring approach to computing. The angle I am interested in is the different approaches to the use of languages, and the AI degree is much closer to this.</p> <p>The course is four years long, including a placement in the third year, which I've just completed. I did it in the university's IT support department - it was really interesting to see the university from a different angle.</p> <p>We've done several programming modules, all of which have been fantastic. We've learnt different kinds of languages for AI modelling and the different structures of programming principles you need for AI. We've also done philosophy modules where we talked about how realistic the idea of AI is and questioned whether something is a valid thinking system. For example, we discussed a man who had a TV remote control embedded in his arm and went around claiming to be a cyborg.</p> <p>When I tell people I'm doing an artificial intelligence degree, they usually ask what it is. I point out something they've used that uses AI. It's often a computer game, and I tell them that when characters do things without being told to, that's AI. And they go: \"Hmmm, very interesting. Let's move on.\"</p> <p>I enjoy programming the most. The phenomenal idea of language being used in the way you would normally use maths, breaking it down into mathematical level commands and building something that understands language, makes my mind boggle.</p> <p>When I finish my degree, I'd like to be a computer games programmer. I've already done a bit of programming for my mum, who loves computer games.</p>",
  "<p>But one student who is confident in discussing money matters is Sammy-Jo Leigh, who is taking a degree in accounting and finance at the University of Kent. She attributes her acumen to the certificate in financial studies, a new level 3 qualification offered by the Institute of Financial Services (IFS), which she gained when she was taking her A-levels at South Kent College.</p> <p>The course provided a consumer's guide to financial products and an overview of how the industry operates. Learning about these things, says Leigh, encouraged her to go on to higher education. \"As well as our college tutor, somebody from the Halifax came in and taught bits of the course,\" she says. \"We got to see the practical side of the theory we were learning. Her explanation of the 'bank multiplier' and how loans are generated was excellent.\"</p> <p>Like many students, Leigh lives with her parents and goes to the nearest university, but she still has to pay for her own food, transport costs, books, clothes and entertainment. Tuition fees are deducted from her student loan.</p> <p>So what useful fiscal tips can she offer? \"I haven't got a credit card because I don't need one,\" she says. \"I've just got a \u00a31,000 overdraft limit. A couple of my friends have credit cards and they use them to buy clothes and go out clubbing. But you can't spend money that isn't there.\"</p> <p>She thought carefully about opening a student bank account, considering the various offers.</p> <p>In the end she opened an HSBC account: \"I got a free student railcard and an overdraft facility.\"</p> <p>She also took a weekend job in a local jeweller's shop to save before going to university, which she has been able to continue alongside her studies. She banks her student loan termly and earns just under \u00a3400 a month from working 16 hours a week.</p> <p>\"I will only spend money when I have it and even then I'll economise wherever I can,\" she explains. \"I'll wait till the January sales to buy clothes and if I'm going drinking with my boyfriend we'll make use of the happy hour.\"</p> <p>But even being this careful, she still goes around \u00a3400 into the red in the three to four weeks before the end of term. Working through the vacation by increasing the hours of her job enables her to wipe off this debt before the start of the next term.</p> <p>Leigh is not from a wealthy background, and with four children to support, her parents are not able to come to the rescue. Currently she buys her own food, spending \u00a320 a week on frozen meals from her local Tesco.</p> <p>Her one big expense is running a small, second-hand car. She arranged credit and pays it off at the rate of \u00a3100 a month by direct debit. \"We learned about credit agreements on the course. I think it's a good deal and the money comes out of my account automatically.\"</p> <p>Leigh is about to start renting a flat with her boyfriend, who is also a student. They have a budget of \u00a3500 a month excluding bills, but between them the finances appear to add up. Both have a student loan of \u00a31,000 a term, and their part-time jobs contribute over \u00a3400 a month to the kitty.</p> <p>When she leaves university, Leigh is hoping for a job in the City. \"I'm hoping for a job that will pay close to \u00a318,000. I've got no worries about having a student loan because I will be able to pay it all off in the medium term.\"</p>",
  "<p>You could spend today regretting the computer solitaire habit you developed during revision. You could regret every single morning when you buried your head in the pillow to block out the books. And you could regret the teacher you didn't get on with, the subject you should never have taken, or the boyfriend/girlfriend who broke your heart on the eve of your exams. Don't. There's too much to do.</p> <p>Because instead of running to the pub or spending the entire day in tears, today you could get yourself a place at university. Or at least make a start on it. It might not be the university you've been thinking about since year dot. It will more likely be a new one, where you'll get that degree you need, make lifelong friends and wonder why you ever would have gone anywhere else.</p> <p>So ignore your gloating friends who bagged their 28 points and are off to Big Brain Business School for Big Heads. Perhaps even ignore all your loved ones who might be being terribly nice to you about your predicament. This is not a day for wallowing in self-pity. You need to take action. If you do need a pick-me-up right now, think of the 39,000 other potential students who are in the same position as you. Of this year's intake, one in 10 either hasn't yet got a place, or has just lost one after getting their results. That's a pretty big club to be in: Club Clearing.</p> <p>Clearing is what Ucas does to match the unfilled spaces on courses to the candidates without a place. It's an accelerated version of the applications process you've already been through. And here's how to do it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You need: to take the day (or perhaps two) off work; a phone line at your disposal; internet connection; pen and paper; your Ucas number; a parent hovering nervously in the background offering food, drink and advice at appropriate moments, but not at inappropriate ones. (It's up to them to decide which is which; they will get it wrong, but that's their job.)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Before going into Clearing, make a last-ditch attempt to resurrect your first choice. Call the department you had as your firm offer and ask them if you still have a chance of a place. Get someone - an admissions tutor, a lecturer, it's worth even starting with the department administrator - on the phone. Explain the situation, what your shortfall is and how keen you are on the degree. Be polite, persistent and patient. Ask them whether they can be at all flexible. If they say no, ask whether there is any chance their decision may change. If they say no again, thank them, say goodbye, and hang up.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Repeat with your insurance option until you have a place or have exhausted all your previous options.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Before you start ploughing through the Clearing websites and online prospectuses, you have to go through the same decision-making process you went through when you first applied, but trawling slightly wider to decide on which universities/courses are worth aiming for. It might help to talk to someone who knows you: that could be a parent, but if emotions are still a little raw, a careers adviser or teacher at school might be a better bet. They will all be in school for the A-level results today. Call them for advice.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jot down the related degrees you might consider - if you were thinking French, consider joint honours. Biology? Write down plant biology, human, or biotech.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ditto with the destinations. You might have wanted Sussex because it's on a campus. Think Kent instead. London because it's in a city? Consider Manchester.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Now turn to the listings in this supplement. For every course you reckon might be worth a go, note down the details, what you liked about it and the number. You can go to <a href=\"http://www.educationtheguardian.com\">EducationGuardian.co.uk</a> to register for email and text updates for your chosen universities/courses (you can also win \u00a31,000, which might cheer you up). If you want extra information, get online and go to the course homepage, where you can get the specifics. The university will be trying to sell it to you; remember they want to fill their places so will make everywhere sound good. Be slightly wary.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Make the calls to your shortlisted courses and ask them for a place. Again, don't beg; ask them questions. They need to be selling themselves to you as much as you do to them. Try to be clear about what you want and find out whether they offer it. Don't be afraid to turn down places if you're not convinced. This decision is yours and you do have a choice in it. Keep the mantra \"they want me\" in your head, because they do. Universities have to fill the places or lose funding. They do want you.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't be afraid to make the calls yourself. This is your responsibility, not your mum's.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Once you come to accepting a place, you'll need the Clearing entry form (CEF) from Ucas. You won't have this today; it will be sent out shortly after the results. But don't let that stop you. You need to be charming those admissions officers now - and they are waiting for you.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> It might take a few days of calling, waiting for admissions tutors to get back to you, calling again, and then persuading them while they go off to check with their superiors. Clearing lasts right up until September, but the places fill up pretty quickly, so now is your best chance.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The mechanics, once you have accepted a place, are like this: fill in the CEF and send it off. Alternatively, if you can take it there yourself, lots of universities run open days and meet-the-tutor days at this point and if it's absolutely horrid, then you can always turn around, form in hand, and start again. If, once you have submitted your form, you change your mind, it will be returned to you for you to carry on through Clearing.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Eventually, your CEF will be submitted, the university will write to confirm it and a few days later so will Ucas. Bingo. A bit different to what you'd planned, but sorted, none the less. Now go and have that beer.</p> <p>But there is still the little matter of where you are going to live. Applying through Clearing means a lot of university halls will have already been allocated. Most universities guarantee a place for first-years, so you aren't going to be homeless. The choice, however, might be a little more limited, so it's worth a visit to check it out. It'll also be a good chance to orientate yourself if you've not yet been there.</p> <p>So that's what's going to happen now. Don't worry that it wasn't what was planned, or that your mates might not have had that battle to fight. You'll get where you need to be. And fighting a little harder for things can be a bonding experience. Chances are, you won't look back.</p>",
  "<p>Another record-breaking crop of A-level results published today provoked a fresh row about the credibility of the so-called \"gold standard\" exam, after headteachers warned last night that with a 96% pass rate and more higher grades, the lower bands of D and E had lost their value. </p> <p>Passes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland rose for the 22nd consecutive year, fuelling the annual chorus of criticism that the exam is easier and prompting claims that on current trends the pass rate could spiral to 100% by the end of the decade. </p> <p>Results of exams taken by more than 250,000 students show that after years of losing ground to girls, boys fought back in 2004, although their achievement was overshadowed by further falls in the popularity of so-called \"hard\" subjects, including physics, French and German. </p> <p>Amid criticism that youngsters were \"working the system\" to try to achieve the highest possible grades to secure a university place, the numbers taking \"softer\" subjects, such as psychology and media studies, which are perceived as easier, saw a corresponding jump. </p> <p>The fact that candidates are allowed to re-take one or more of the six A-level modules has also fuelled the controversy surrounding the exam, although the exam boards and government ministers insist that standards are being maintained. Only one paper in every 25 is now failed. </p> <p>This year's provisional results show an 0.8% percentage point increase in the overall percentage of candidates achieving a grade A (22.4% compared with 21.6% last year), up from less than 10% 20 years ago. With the scramble for university places due to start today, the trend fuelled growing controversy over how universities and employers can distinguish between hordes of candidates clutching strings of straight As. Schools revealed yesterday that some students will learn this morning that they have achieved six straight As.</p> <p>The results are the last before a government-appointed working party announces a new blueprint for the 14-19 exam system, which could eventually replace both A-levels and GCSEs with a new-style English diploma.</p> <p>The general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, David Hart, warned last night that A-levels were going the way of GCSEs in the sense that universities and employers were increasingly unlikely to look at candidates with less than a C - effectively considered the real pass. \"Ds and Es are a perfectly good recognition of good teaching and hard work. But I think that, inevitably, we are moving to a situation where As, Bs and Cs are going to be regarded as the benchmark. Employers will increasingly look to As, Bs and Cs as the important benchmark... It seems to be moving towards the situation of GCSEs.\"</p> <p>The core subjects of English and maths are in the top three subjects, with the remainder of the top 10 representing a mix of traditional and newer subject areas. Computing and information and communications technology A-levels slumped down the popularity league - a trend interpreted by some as a sign that IT has now become such a mainstream skill learned at an early age in school that fewer pupils feel the need to specialise in it after 16.</p> <p>Law, psychology and media studies continued a marked rise - particularly among girls. However, religious studies showed the biggest leap, up 13.8 percentage points - a change possibly reflecting a growing interest in faith and world religions post September 11.</p> <p>Teaching unions raised concerns over the continuing freefall in numbers taking physics and modern languages.</p> <p>Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said of physics: \"Over the last five years, the number of students taking the subject at A-level has dropped by 5,200. If this rate of decline continues, will physics become the next Latin and disappear altogether?\"</p> <p>There was a mixed reaction from employers. The director general of the Confederation of British Industry, Digby Jones, said: \"The hard work of A-level students and teachers deserves praise. I am worried that the discussion about grade inflation is taking the education debate in this country on an annual wild goose chase. Grade inflation is an important issue for some universities, but claims that employers are hugely worried are wildly overdone.\"</p> <p>James Walsh, policy adviser with the Institute of Directors, which has been one of the most vocal critics of so-called grade inflation, said: \"Employers and universities are finding it increasingly difficult to select the very best candidates from A-level students. With an ever-growing number of A grade passes being awarded, the brightest students are not shining through.\"</p> <p>He added: \"A-levels may not be perfect, but employers continue to value them. There is certainly no need to subsume A-levels into a multi-tiered diploma.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat education spokesman, Phil Willis, said: \"Every year the A-level pass rate goes up. Every year critics say that exams are getting easier. Today's students and teachers are only doing what might be expected of them in a very competitive environment. Pupils choose subjects where they think they can achieve the best grades - hence the fall in the numbers taking science and mathematics.\" Dr Ellie Johnson Searle, director of the Joint Council for Qualifications, which issued the results on behalf of the boards, insisted that standards were being maintained and denied that re-sitting modules was responsible for much of the improvements. \"I think it is a result of better informed choices by candidates and I think this is a reflection of how well the system works.\" </p> <p>The schools standards ministers, David Miliband, declared: \"We are getting better as a country at getting the best out of our young people. We should applaud them and applaud their schools and colleges.\"</p>",
  "<p>Whether the prospect fills you with a looming sense of dread or the thrill of anticipated release, if you are starting university this year you will probably be officially leaving home. Now, the concept of leaving home on one particular day in your life is a total nonsense. Leaving home actually takes about 10 years - starting when you go to university and only ending when you learn to make roast potatoes that are better than your mum's.</p> <p>But this is the start of the big break. You will leave your familiar surroundings and head off into the wide world to create your own little nest somewhere else (\"little\", in the case of most university accommodation, being the operative word), in a manner that entirely suits you. Hopefully.</p> <p><strong>What to take ... </strong></p> <p>Take your entire CD collection. For one thing, lots of CDs make you look cool. For another, a term is long and whatever you leave behind is guaranteed to be the specific tune you are dying to dance to/cry to/seduce to six weeks in.</p> <p>Obviously, the ownership of a stereo (see also: kettle, toaster, anglepoise lamp) is as essential to the student experience as breathing. Similarly, you won't want to wear the same two pairs of jeans and four t-shirts for an entire term. The social whirl of a new university career will at the very least necessitate many outfit changes and the more clothes you have, the less laundry you need to do.</p> <p>In order to make your new home homely, you will need a few crucial items to elevate your room in halls from brutally minimalistic to cosily liveable. A vaguely ethnic looking throw from your gap-year travels (to Camden market in London) is a good place to start. Or get yourself to Ikea and purchase a rug, a couple of nice prints and a bag of tea-light candles. Not sure why, exactly, but it's the law that no one can leave Ikea without a bag of tea-light candles.</p> <p>Also, pick up some cheap crockery and cutlery. You don't need a dinner service for 12 people. Keep it to a minimum or you'll never do any washing up. A pot plant (spider plants or peace lilies are virtually indestructible) and a poster or two (arty and interesting, please; anything with Bart Simpson on will just make you look like a total student) would also be a good idea.</p> <p>Make sure you have a bank account you can access at college, that important mail will be forwarded on (you do know your new address, don't you?) and that you know who is going to be paying your phone bill. If your parents keep your mobile juiced at the moment, they might seriously reconsider once you start spending all evening on the phone to your best mate (who's on a different network, naturally).</p> <p>Make room to take at least one gratuitously sentimental item to remind you of home. If homesickness should bite (and it does for many people, even those who are deliriously happy about starting college), it's nice to have something to hold while you have a little cry. But don't make the mistake of thinking \"Well, I might need it ...\" about everything your eye alights upon while you're packing, because otherwise you might as well hire a removal van.</p> <p><strong>... and what to leave behind</strong></p> <p>In some sense, you never really leave anyone behind. Your friends from home will still be your friends; your family will still be your family. But leaving home means changes, be they subtle or less so. Take a bit of time to prepare yourself for that fact - and be realistic. If you have a relationship on the go, you don't want to imagine that it'll ever end. And, who knows, maybe it won't. But it might be expedient to have a few worst-case-scenario discussions with your beloved now, just in case, because nothing is quite as destructive to a romance as freshers' week.</p> <p>It's a good job you can't take your parents to college with you - they'd come if they could. No matter how many times they tell you they can't wait to turn your room into a home gym, they'll miss you so much you'll be amazed. The weeks running up to your departure date might be characterised by unusual sentimentality or snappiness. Don't be too alarmed, there's nothing you can do about it. Just make sure that when you eventually say goodbye you give them a big hug, thank them for everything, tell them you love them (that's important) and promise you'll phone the next day. And then phone the next day.</p> <p>No matter what separation anxieties your parents are going through, your main concern might be leaving your mates. Or perhaps not - lots of people treat going to university as a chance to reinvent themselves or leave behind the restrictions of their social circle's expectations of them. If that's you, maybe pause to consider who or what you wish to become; it'll help when you arrive and are wondering if the new improved you would accept Earl Grey or peppermint tea.</p> <p>Or maybe you're heartbroken at leaving your friends. Don't make rash promises about calling every day and visiting every weekend: you won't. You will make new friends at college, who may end up being even closer to you than your old ones. This is normal, natural and probably essential. On the other hand, don't sever all contact with your current crowd. Because it's only a few short weeks until Christmas, when you have to pack up everything you brought with you and return home. And when you do, honestly, it'll be like you've never been away.</p>",
  "<p>Living in the smartest, newest hall of residence your university has to offer, complete with your own en-suite bathroom and even a private fridge, might sound like heaven. But then again, sometimes the less apparently grand room offers the greater comfort.</p> <p>Where students live affects how much they get out of their undergraduate life almost as much as being on the most suitable course, as tutors and students from the oldest to the newest of universities agree. One of the great truths is that most students now come from homes with a significant level of comfort - and therefore will not tolerate the bare, cramped rooms of the past. Many of those who drop out in their first year give being unhappy with their accommodation as an important reason.</p> <p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution to where to live, and there is only one sound piece of advice to follow: look for accommodation to suit your needs and pocket. Prices range from around \u00a350 to \u00a380-plus a week, with northern universities tending to be cheaper than those around London. Self-catered is generally cheaper than catered.</p> <p>All will have some extras. Most charge more for services such as telephone and internet access in individual rooms, where this is available. Older halls tend to have single rooms plus a common living and kitchen area for each corridor. Newer ones are organised into flats of around seven rooms with a kitchen and living area. In most, students are responsible for buying their own TV licence - something most forget until the reminder arrives.</p> <p>Choosing accommodation needs thought. First, of course, is the question of whether you want to live at home or in halls. Halls vary. The older one usually have shared bathroom and kitchen facilities. Some halls that look like a glorified holiday village have bathroom blocks of institutional bleakness.</p> <p>There is a trend in big conurbations, such as London or Birmingham, for students from the local area to choose to live in halls for the first year, to build a circle of friends and get involved in the social life. Then, in the second year, they may move back home, for cheapness and access to a well stocked fridge.</p> <p>Universities in cities tend to have a variety of halls, some close to lecture halls, some distant. Those who fall out of bed at the last minute are probably better off choosing to live closer. Those who like a bike ride to wake up in the morning might opt to be further away.</p> <p>Campus universities, of course, have most of their accommodation an easy walk from lecture halls. Universities close to different attractions - mountains in Bangor; the sea in Plymouth - have halls that provide easier access for those who have chosen their university with the outdoors in mind.</p> <p>Most accommodation, however, comes with the guarantee of regular cleaning and on-the-spot accommodation managers, as well as tutors to turn to for help. Most hall food will keep body and soul together, but it will not be grand. The best offer basic homestyle cooking, served over a period of several hours; the worst, something akin to a bad school dinner. For the most part food will only be served at set times.</p> <p>Sometimes just breakfast is offered; sometimes an evening meal, too. Occasionally, universities or individual halls still expect students to dine in perhaps once a week. Even those that cater usually offer some shared cooking facilities as well - even if it is only a microwave to heat a pizza.</p> <p>You need to choose where to live just as carefully as you make your choice of university location and course. Most universities make halls of residence available for viewing on open days; most students, by the time they apply, have forgotten what the halls look like.</p> <p>What you need is the most important consideration. Parents may favour catered, to make sure their beloved offspring doesn't starve, or non-smoking, on health grounds. You may want to experiment with cooking and be able to entertain smoking friends.</p> <p>When filling in the application forms, think about the levels of creature comforts you want. The next stage is to think about how far the hall is from the lecture theatre. If you don't mind commuting and are living with a circle of friends, being a little way from the university centre can work. If you want to stumble out of bed and into a lecture in three minutes, you need to live only two minutes' run away.</p> <p>Once you have ticked all the boxes - catered/self-catering, close/distant, mixed/single sex, smoking/non-smoking - the rest is for the university to decide. Different institutions operate different polices. Some like to mix students, putting northerners and southerners together, and mixing law students with mathematicians and artists. Others prefer to house those studying the same subject together.</p> <p>Tom Greatorex was out gap travelling in Vietnam when the address of his home-to-be at the University of Sussex was e-mailed to him. He had filled in his forms months earlier. Almost as a joke, he says, he requested \"en-suite\". He did not expect to get it, but he did - and in the newest block on campus. Other students he met on a beach said: \"Oh, that court! That's the one that will have the huge hallway. That's where all the parties will be.\"</p> <p>They were right about the parties - and most of last year he loved it. But there were, as with any new building, teething problems, including an over-sensitive fire alarm. This year he has rented a house with six friends halfway between the campus at Falmer and Brighton. He plans to buy a bike, since bus fares are high.</p> <p>Problems with new accommodation are not confined to one university. Increased student numbers are fuelling a rush to build.</p> <p>At Queen Mary College, University of London, Sonia Sony feels she benefited hugely from living in halls, though she did encounter some problems. Living in brand new halls behind the university library, she was delighted with her three-minute walk to lectures, her en-suite facilities and her own mini-fridge in her room, but she and her friends were less happy when fire alarms started going off at two and three in the morning.</p> <p>She is going back to live with her parents in Enfield, north London, this year, \"so that I can concentrate on my study and not have to think about good food\". Moving back for this middle year of her three-year law degree shouldn't be a problem, she says, because she has made a firm circle of friends, but she may move back again for her final year, to avoid the pressure of travelling.</p> <p>Like many students, she has to balance the cost of travel, rent and food costs when deciding where to live. Her journey to college from her family home takes 30 to 45 minutes and will cost \u00a3134 a month. But her rent, in the sort of shared accommodation available near Queen Mary, could be \u00a390 a week, plus bills and food.</p> <p>A majority of first-year students - particularly those starting to study at the traditional age of 18 or 19 - live in halls for their first year, then move out in their second year, often into shared accommodation. Many can move back into halls for their final year. In any university town, there is a market in rented homes, some good, some dodgy and some challenging.</p> <p>The percentage in halls is greater in the older universities and in campuses outside big conurbations, and lower in the newer universities, which often have a larger number of mature and part-time students, who often live at home.</p> <p>Every university has a student housing bureau that will help to find suitable, privately rented accommodation as well as allocate places in halls. Most can offer a guaranteed halls place to all first-years who want one - and all are anxious to make sure their students are comfortable.</p> <p>They all also try to leave themselves spare rooms to accommodate late applications at Clearing time and to move students who are unhappy with the first room they are assigned to. If the room you are offered first-time around really doesn't suit your purpose, talk to them quickly about your need to change.</p> <p>Every student union also has a housing officer who is equipped to deal with everything from unhappiness with the room offered to problems with rent and advice on contracts or other legal difficulties with private landlords. They will also offer advice on other problems with settling in - including advice about nutrition and cooking.</p>",
  "<p>Trip Hawkins, the videogame visionary who formed Electronic Arts back in 1982, and later launched the 3DO games console, moved into mobile gaming last year with his new company, <a href=\"http://www.digitalchocolate.com\">Digital Chocolate</a>. The developer has just announced its opening line-up of Java and BREW titles: Baseball Heroes of the MLBPAA and Bubble Ducky. The latter is a puzzle game, apparently, and not some kind of camp bathing simulation. Disappointingly.</p> <p>Trip is certainly not the first videogame legend to turn up in the mobile sector. John Romero, co-founder of Id, is now running mobile development studio <a href=\"http://www.monkeystone.com\">Monkeystone</a>, Dave Jones, founder of DMA Design (responsible for Lemmings and the GTA series), is working on mobile gaming projects, Nolan Bushnell's company <a href=\"http://www.uwinks.com\">uWinks</a> develops for mobile platforms and Dave Ward, founder of eighties giant Ocean Software, went on to become chairman of <a href=\"http://www.ifone.com\">iFone</a> the Manchester-based mobile studio bringing all of Atari's classic coin-ops to Java handsets.</p> <p>Perhaps it's down to the gold rush feel of the mobile sector, its small teams, small budgets and quick turnaround - all very familiar from the golden era of videogaming and home computers. Maybe these early auteurs have found it impossible to tune into the faceless, corporate dynamic of the modern console industry, which has little patience with individual thinking (see Clive Thompson's interesting angle on <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2104869/\">this</a>).</p> <p>It's interesting to think about Trip Hawkins' failed <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/h2g2/guide/A378173\">3DO</a> console nowadays, especially in relation to the comparative success of Xbox. 3DO, you may remember, was the first-ever CD-based 32bit games console when it launched back in 1993. Hamstrung by a lack of Japanese developer support and an extortionate launch price, it was obliterated by the launch of the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation a year later. Surely Microsoft must have looked at this earlier American attempt to break Japan's stranglehold on the videogame hardware market, and taken a few tips. Interestingly though, the two machines have some similarities: most obviously a reliance on western-developed games, and sheer ugly size. Seems that Trip was eight years too early. Better luck this time.</p> <p><strong>The five best games on 3DO</strong> 1. Return Fire (Prolific) - really addictive two-player strategy shooter based around a 'capture the flag' structure. 2. Need For Speed (EA) - the original version of EA's street driving brand. Great cars, great circuits, great handling. 3. Super Street Fighter II Turbo (Capcom) - near-arcade perfect translation of Capcom's own favourite Street Fighter title. 4. Star Fighter (Studio 3DO) - slightly hypnotic sci-fi flight sim with decent flight model. 5. FIFA International Soccer (EA) - early realisation of the FIFA brand, before they tried to confuse us with off the ball control.</p> <p>Just checked: there's a Panasonic 3DO and several of the above games on Ebay at the moment for \u00a330...</p>",
  "<p><strong>9.30pm </strong> Incredible scenes in Athens. Not really, but it made you all sit up and take notice, didn't it? Eh? Oh. The best I can offer you is that the Russian men's water polo team have beaten Croatia 9-8, and as I'm guessing you're probably all as interested in that bit of news as I am, I'm going to say goodbye. Thanks for your emails, Mike.</p> <p><strong>9.15pm </strong> Matthew is back again, and he's fairly forceful in his opinion that poker definitely should be an Olympic sport. \"It requires stamina, awesome judgement and technique, mind games, patience, aggression, intelligence, which is rather more than the 100m,\" he says, and he's not finished there. \"What about darts and chess too. And why not snooker - as much physical exercise as shooting.\" A strong argument, and it would also mean we might win some more gold medals.</p> <p>Because I still have nothing to report, some statistics for you. With their gold in the sailing today, Britain have rocketed up to 16th place in the medals table, one below Greece but ahead of such luminaries as Poland and Slovakia. At the top of the table, the US have moved above China for the first time.</p> <p><strong>9pm</strong> The Beeb have reverted to their old tricks of showing highlights, so I've decided to do likewise, mainly because there seems to be little action at the moment. So, in the briefest of brief reviews of the day's tennis, the men's quarter-finals have all finished. Taylor Dent, Nicolas Massu, Mardy Fish and Fernando Gonzales will compete in the semi-finals for the medals - hardly the big-name quartet predicted at the start of the week. So to Eurosport, and some basketball. Having lived with a Greek, I know how much they love their basketball, and the packed crowd will not be pleased with what they're watching - their boys are being crushed by Lithuania 54-25 with 20 seconds left on the clock in the second quarter.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in a bid to start a little debate, I'm wondering whether poker should become an Olympic sport. Many countries play the game, it's very tactical, and it's got to be more exciting than synchronised swimming. Don't you think?</p> <p><strong>8.45pm </strong> For Matthew Renshaw, who wants to be entertained while he plays poker (not sure this will actually entertain you, though, Matthew), and for Jack Lee, to prove I don't think he's sad (honest, Jack), here is the latter's helpful knowledge: \"The reason why it's marked out of 9.9 (7:40pm) is because that's the difficulty tarrif. Only the insane (as opposed to impossible for a normal human) stuff is marked out of 10. Am I a) sad? b) not a bloke? c) avoiding work? I leave you to judge.\" In fact, I'm busy, so I'll leave you lot to judge.</p> <p>Incidentally, Beth Tweddle finished 19th, and now she's off to Liverpool John Moores University (oh, to be a student again); Katy Lennon finished 21st.</p> <p><strong>8.40pm </strong> There we go, the blubbering has commenced. Calrey Patterson has scored 9.712 on the floor, her faultless double somersault ending making Khorkina's look almost amateur. It truly was inspired. She's the first American to win the all-round title for 20 years. She is crying. The wonderfully named Anna Pavlova could only manage 9.425 with her twist on the vault. She is crying. China's Zhang Nan thus squeezed her out to take the bronze medal. She is crying. Khorkina, on the other hand, well she's a woman - there's no tears for her, just a resigned smile, and then a hug for the winner. Now she is taking the plaudits from the crowd for her second place. It's been very emotional.</p> <p>For those of you who couldn't care less about gymnastics, and I'm sure there are some of you out there, how about some men's hockey? Australia have beaten India 4-3. It's irrelevant for Britain, who were thrashed 5-1 by Spain earlier.</p> <p><strong>8.25pm</strong> Svetlana Khorkina has performed her floor exercise excellently, though her final double somersault was perilously close to landing outside the area. The crowd was cheering and clapping, but how did the judges see it .... only 9.562. Carley Patterson looks pleased with that - now it's up to her to do better. We shall see...</p> <p><strong>8.16pm </strong> Especially for Kate Wells, who wants me to write more updates to keep her entertained in her office (!!), I am going to try to type you a running commentary of the next gymnast to go. It could prove tricky, as I'm also trying to prepare a quiz for you all, write stories for anything that happens, enough. Here comes Beth Tweddle on the vault. Powerful on the runway, half turn with a double pike somersault, well done, lots of flight ... no, sorry Kate, I can't keep up with these girls. I'll be back at 8.25! Intriguingly, Barry Davies has just said that Patterson versus Khorkina is a battle of power and strength against grace and beauty. He's leaving it up to us to decide which one is which. Bit harsh Bazza, though I know which one I'd rather win.</p> <p><strong>8.10pm </strong> Svetlana Khorkina has slipped on the beam and into second place on the overall standings. Khorkina could only manage a 9.462, and will now have to perform brilliantly on the floor to have any chance of winning. American teenager Carley Patterson has, like, soooo moved into the gold medal position. The girls are fighting back the tears at the moment, but give it half an hour and this hall could be flooded.</p> <p><strong>7.55pm</strong> As expected, Svetlana Khorkina has moved into the lead after two rounds, the halfway point of the competition. However, the bars are being scored higher than any other discipline, so the contest is far from over. The Russian moves to the beam next. Romanian Nicoleta Sofronie is in second place. Katy Lennon lies fiteenth after a decent spiral turn-thingy on the vault, and Beth Tweddle is in 23rd after a fine score of 9.412 on the floor.</p> <p><strong>7.40pm </strong>Svetlana Khorkina has scored 9.725 on the bars, her favourite event. She had a slightly faulty landing explaining why she didn't scored a perfect 9.9 - why they can't just mark it out of 10 I do not know. She looks happy with that, it seems a generous score. Twenty-five year old Khorkina once posed naked for Russian playboy just to prove she is \"all woman, and not a girl\". At 5ft 5in she is certainly more graceful looking than the other girls, and she should now be near the lead at the end of round two.</p> <p>Back at the pool, the drama continues. Britain have confirmed they have appealed against the reinstatement of Aaron Peirsol. \"I am extremely disappointed that it was overturned on a technicality when the infringement was obvious,\" Bill Sweetenham said. \"To have an infringement overturned because of incompetent paperwork is nonsensical.\" Quite right. Will the officials have the guts to upset the Americans though? I doubt it.</p> <p><strong>7.25pm </strong> Russia's Svetlana Khorkina, the Russian queen of gymnastics, has just undertaken her first discipline - she scored 9.462 on the vault with a tuck front somersault with one and a half turns I am reliably informed. She lies in fifth place, with a French girl - who's name eludes me at present - in the lead after her routine on the bars. Britain's Beth Tweddle has performed on the beam but sadly fell off halfway through. Her score of 7.800 puts her 24th of the 24 competitors, but we expect better to follow later. Katy Lennon is in joint 18th place after a first round mark of 8.925. Ah, the French girl is called Emilie Lepennec. Don't say I don't tell you anything.</p> <p><strong>7.10pm </strong> Ha, I was just teasing you with the gymnastics. More swimming news first. James Hickman has missed out on the final of the 100m butterfly after finishing seventh in the first semi-final in a time of 53.10sec. Michael Phelps, fresh from his fourth gold medal just half an hour ago, won the second semi-final and set an Olympic record in the process. I have a feeling we could be hearing that familiar American anthem again tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>6.55pm </strong> Good evening everybody. No time for niceties unfortunately. Merely time to report that Justine Henin-Hardenne has beaten Mary Pierce in straight sets to move into the semi-finals of the women's singles. Oh, and at the swimming pool Michael Phelps is watching the stars and stripes ascend the pole for the fourth time this week. \"Oh say can you see.\" </p> <p>Jodie Henry of Australia has beaten Hollands Inge de Bruijn into second place in the 100m freestyle. And now prepare youreslf for some bitching and some tears - the women's individual all-round gymnastics is about to begin.</p> <p><strong>6.30pm</strong> Blimey that Amanda Beard's got a piercing or two. No, she hasn't just stripped off for a celebration streak, but the close ups reveal a fair few rings in her ears. But I digress - the races are once again underway, and Phelps looks good for a fourth gold... and gets it with an Olympic record time. The Americans get silver as well with Lochte, and Bovell of Trinidad had a good second half to take the bronze.</p> <p>\"I just cant take the tension!!!!!!\" screams James A. Davies, but I've got a feeling there's a tongue in a cheek somewhere there. Either way, I'm off for the evening. Cheerio.</p> <p><strong>6.17pm</strong> The pace is relentless out there! No sooner have the last contestants clambered out of the pool than the next competitors are being lined up - it doesn't make for lengthy ahem, comfort breaks, let me tell you. Brief respite for a medal ceremony though, and after that we'll be treated to the men's 200m medley final, I'm led to believe.</p> <p><strong>6.10pm</strong> Second semi - Komarova of Russia will be the favourite in this one with a 2:10 (all the lingo here) in qualifying. She does indeed take it, with Coventry (Zim) in second and Buschschulte (Ger) in third - it's fairly slow and Sexton has just about crept into the final. Phew.</p> <p><strong>6.05pm</strong> Razvan Florea (Romania) got the bronze in that last race, and Goddard didn't look too pleased with his bronze. A medal's a medal my boy. </p> <p>Now, onto the women's 200m backstroke semis, in which Britain's Katy Sexton is racing... in seventh so far though, and it's Japan's Nakamura out in front. She takes it, Hoelzer of America is second and Terakawa's third. Sexton makes fourth but the second semi is a fast one, and she might be edged out here.</p> <p><strong>5.57pm</strong> Goddard gets off to a great start, but Peirsol soon nudges himself in front, and we just miss out on bronze! He went out so fast, but just couldn't hang on in the last 50m. By golly! They've disqualified Peirsol and Goddard's got bronze! Austria's Rogan gets gold, and I'll fill you in on silver when I can get the details.</p> <p><strong>5.50pm</strong> Right, men's 200m backstroke final now and James Goddard and Gregor Tait are looking to bring something home for Britain against Aaron Peirsol of the USA, amongst others. Tait's in lane two, Goddard's in lane five, and the fact that they're both there, regardless of medals, is a sign of progress in British swimming. Quite sad, but let's not dwell.</p> <p><strong>5.47pm</strong> This should be a head to head between defending Olympic champion Agnes Kovacs and world champion American Amanda Beard - but 16-year-old Aussie Liesel Jones might mix things up a bit. Jones goes out incredibly fast, and about half way through Beard realises and starts to push on. Looks like a world record could go here, but who it will be goes right down the wire...</p> <p>Beard just about takes it with a massive lung for the board and a new Olympic record, and Jones will have to be satisfied with silver. Anne Poleska hands Germany their second swimming bronze.</p> <p><strong>5.38pm</strong> The second semi-final is also devoid of British interest, and almost everyone finishes at the same time. US swimmer Jason Lazek wins, Oleksander Volynets of the Ukraine's second and Gary Hall of USA is third. Women's 200m breastroke final next...</p> <p><strong>5.33pm</strong> Sharron Davies and her inconceivably long fingernails are back poolside, and I believe things will get underway with the men's 50m freestyle semi finals - and the first is all over very quickly. South Africa's Ronald Schoeman takes it with a new commonwealth record of 20.199s, Brett Hawke of Australia is second and Salim Ilies of Algeria is third.</p> <p><strong>5.27pm</strong> Right, I'm back, and the live (live? BBC? what? etc.) swimming starts in a matter of moments. Don't miss it.</p> <p><strong>5.20pm</strong> Men's 10m running target final standing: first - Manfred Kurzer (Ger) 682.4, second - Alexander Blinov (Rus) 678.0, third - Dimitri Lykin (Rus) 677.1. Must dash, world's latest Fiver to sub...</p> <p><strong>5.10pm</strong> Random facts while I wait for something interesting to happen on Eurosport: China 33-13 Greece, and Angola 30-40 South Korea. It might be fun to let you guess the sport, but to satisfy the terms of this job I must tell you it's women's handball. Feeling informed? That's what I'm here for.</p> <p><strong>5.02pm</strong> \"I am stuck in an office in Charlotte, North Carolina; if I hear one more comment from my co-workers about how great Michael Phelps is, I'm going to hit them in the Ynglings.\" George Astridge embraces Britain's new favourite sport in the 3756th corny joke discovered to work with the boat name, but I like it. The Japanese have just notched up another gold with an ippon in the aforementioned judo.</p> <p><strong>5pm</strong> Eighth seed Ai Sugiyama of Japan has lost to Alicia Molik of Australia 6-3, 6-4 in the women's tennis quarterfinals, and Eurosport are treating me to a China v Japan women's judo bout. Not quite as exciting as the badminton, but oddly fascinating, don't you think? Both women are on a koka and there are about two minutes left. </p> <p><strong>4.54pm</strong> Or not, as the case may b- is. Galiazzo shoots 30 out of 30 off the last three arrows, and the BBC once again have conned me with a very live looking replay. I presume I'm not watching some kind of play off against an Australian, and, well, he's losing that too. Bah.</p> <p><strong>4.50pm</strong> Well, where do we go from there then? British lad Lawrence Godfrey is competing in the archery against Marco Galiazzo, and has a one point lead after eight arrows. That's a start.</p> <p><strong>4.38pm</strong> Oh, it's all over, the Chinese have taken it. Still, we've got silver, which is a lot better than usual, eh? That's badminton back off the map for another four years, I suspect.</p> <p><strong>4.36pm</strong> Cripes, we're back to gold medal point, once again to the Chinese, and once again I'm ruing getting carried away on the Britbandwagon earlier... but once again we've saved it! Well, Gail Emms has, tapping a backhand floorwards. </p> <p><strong>4.34pm</strong> Ah, we're at gold medal point, to the Chinese, and my earlier confidence looks to have been premature... although Robertson has just got it back to 14-12 with a great backhand flick.</p> <p><strong>4.32pm</strong> That's just uncalled for - the Chinese are running around, fist-pumping like Tim Henman on speed after going 13-11 up thanks to some hefty overhead smashing.</p> <p><strong>4.29pm</strong> Lordy, we're back to 11-12! Even Tom Gray, yesterday's visitor from early evolution, is getting excited. </p> <p><strong>4.27pm</strong> The commentary, if it's possible, is getting cheesier as the points clock up. \"Manna from heaven,\" twitters David Mercer as Britain go 11-9 up.</p> <p><strong>4.25pm</strong> Emms is hammering the shuttlecock at their feet and there's not a thing they can do about it. 10-8 at the moment.</p> <p><strong>4.23pm</strong> Crikey, the Chinese are really sailing with the wind, but Britain have just nudged back in front, 9-8.</p> <p><strong>4.21pm</strong> You've never seen anything until you've seen this Chinese gentleman fist pump on winning a point. 8-7 lead, but, according to the Beeb, Emms and Robertson have got to \"get back to hunting the shuttle.\" Right-o.</p> <p><strong>4.19pm</strong> Really glad - it's 7-6 now. </p> <p><strong>4.16pm</strong> I don't want to scupper things here but if we don't win this, I'll, erm, be very surprised is what I'll be. The Chinese are really rattled, and the British contingent are shouting down their three supporters in traditional fashion. They've got it back to 7-4 now... glad I didn't make any rash promises.</p> <p><strong>4.14pm</strong> Now that's not something we like to see (said in best John Motson voice) - bit of gamesmanship from the Chinese there, but eventually Gail Emms get to serve - and when the Chinese try and get the shuttlecock changed, she flounces over to the umpire and is having none of it. 7-3 to the Brits.</p> <p><strong>4.10pm</strong> What battling spirit from the Brits, who've fought their way back to 5-3 up in the final set! I can't quite believe how excited I'm getting about badminton, but what the heck, let's embrace it.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Stumps: England 313-5 (Flintoff 72, Jones 22)</strong> That's it. Fine innings from Ian Bell, good one from Michael Vaughan, and an effortless one from Flintoff. Thanks for all your emails - I haven't laughed so much since I last saw a suit fall over while running to make the train in the morning. Goodnight, Rob.</p> <p><strong>89th over: England 310-5 (Flintoff 70, Jones 21)</strong> Here's Adam Blackwell: \"What about nouns being forced to double as verbs? As in 'Let's dialogue on that', or 'This decision will impact our bottom line'.\"</p> <p><strong>88th over: England 309-5 (Flintoff 70, Jones 20)</strong> England are playing for the close now, as are the West Indies. And so am I, I'm here to tell you.</p> <p><strong>87th over: England 305-5 (Flintoff 69, Jones 17)</strong> Pat Sharp's leaving Heart FM! That's ruined my day. Meanwhile, here's Tristan Haley-Burrows. \"Whilst I agree with you Rob, I think the profile could be much better defined by doing a 'Friends girl' times 'SATC girl' times 'Girls Aloud girl' equation.If I was any good at maths I'd be able to tell you the exact number of possibilities. For the record it's Rachel, Miranda, and (inexplicably) the ginger one.\" Or Rachel x Miranda x Nadine, although the last one's a 'mute' point.</p> <p><strong>86th over: England 303-5 (Flintoff 68, Jones 16)</strong> No sign of the new ball, as Sarwan continues into the trough in a bid to tempt Flintoff. Eventually he does - and Flintoff wellies it square on the leg side for four to bring up the 300. Random thoughts from Ben Hayes: \"The single most annoying thing in the world is the overuse and misuse of the word 'random' when it is anything but random - possibly a mere coincidence, and it is most certainly not a noun - you cannot pull a 'random'. Even worse when coupled with the aforementioned finger quotes - 'random'.\"</p> <p><strong>85th over: England 299-5 (Flintoff 64, Jones 16)</strong> Yes, Jonathan Donaghy, she is.</p> <p><strong>84th over: England 299-5 (Flintoff 64, Jones 16)</strong> Dermot Reeve and Mike Atherton are discussing which 'Friends' girl they prefer. Idiots! Everyone knows it's the Sex And The City girl of choice that defines you. And before the four of you who are still logged on ask, mine's Miranda. Meanwhile, this pair have already added 63 at more than four an over.</p> <p><strong>83rd over: England 298-5 (Flintoff 64, Jones 15)</strong> Collymore, who bowled excellently this morning, which means the umpires should be giving him a nice, shiny new cherry any second.</p> <p><strong>82nd over: England 296-5 (Flintoff 62, Jones 15)</strong> Here's Dan Callow: \"I recently heard someone who was not particularly computer literate described as 'standing at the tollbooth to the Information Superhighway, proffering the wrong change,' which reduced me to tears of horror and mirth in equal measure....\"</p> <p><strong>81st over: England 290-5 (Flintoff 62, Jones 9)</strong> Smith changes ends, to little effect: Flintof clouts him for four more. And then another. This is scintillating stuff.</p> <p><strong>80th over: England 282-5 (Flintoff 54, Jones 9)</strong> Ten overs to go, and the introduction of Flintoff's one-time nemesis Ramnaresh Sarwan makes no difference. \"I am Matthew Amer's boss and I completely deny his outrageous assertion that I am using Soulmates service to find a partner,\" says Richard Embray. \"However, I am a 28yr old 6ft2 male, been told attractive, WLTM financially independent 18 yr old. Non smoker preferred.\"</p> <p><strong>79th over: England 281-5 (Flintoff 53, Jones 9)</strong> Bravo feeds Jones's strength - the cut shot - and he flaps in the air but between the two gullies. These two are launching another of their counter-attacks. \"In your paean to Dwayne Smith, you entirely overlook his strongest feature,\" says James Burton. \"His middle name is Rommel.\"</p> <p><strong>78th over: England 277-5 (Flintoff 53, Jones 5)</strong> Fifty for Flintoff, who has now made a half-century in his last <em>eight</em> Tests. How's that for consistency? Here's Matthew Amer: \"Not related to annoying phrases in any way, I just felt I needed to say that 'Movie Fan Rich' as featured in the Guardian Soulmates Ad currently drawing attention away from your sparkling commentary is in fact my boss, although I've never seen him in a big cardboard box.\" Busted! And there's another one.</p> <p><strong>77th over: England 266-5 (Flintoff 43, Jones 5)</strong> Bravo, who is the one person who fancies bowling to Flintoff, yelps like a strangled moggy when he raps Flintoff on the pad. It looked out, but replays showed an inside-edge - top-class decision from Darrell Hair. If I had a hat, etc. \"Was once in a meeting when instead of being asked to look into something I was invited to 'Turn over that stone',\" shudders Michael Hatcher. \"Got a terrific dirty look when I instinctively laughed out loud in response.\"</p> <p><strong>76th over: England 266-5 (Flintoff 42, Jones 5)</strong> Dwayne Smith is dobbing away at Jones like the school snitch. I think he's an under-rated bowler - he gives batsmen just enough rope to hang themselves - and as for his batting: he has a truly extraordinary (if totally erratic) talent. Well worth watching. Here's A Mills: People who make jokes by saying, 'as the actress said to the bishop' must die.\"</p> <p><strong>75th over: England 266-5 (Flintoff 42, Jones 5)</strong> Flintoff is really thinking outside the box here. West Indies need to push the envelope out, big-time. A length ball from Bravo is timed quite gloriously on the up through the covers. That was awesome. \"'What can I do you for',\" says Louise Wright. \"Used repeatedly by a particularly obnoxious former colleague when answering the phone. Sets my teeth on edge, that.\"</p> <p><strong>74th over: England 262-5 (Flintoff 38, Jones 5)</strong> I've never seen Flintoff bat with such startlingly easy control as he has here. He looks like the world is his lobster, and that he can take singles or boundaries when he wants, where he wants, or how he wants. Either this is a false dawn, or he is about to blossom into a truly extraordinary cricketer. More shockers, meanwhile: 'Can I get [a Coke, etc]', 'For my sins', 'I'll write you', 'Word', and, of course, 'specificity'.</p> <p><strong>73rd over: England 259-5 (Flintoff 35, Jones 4)</strong> Flintoff whaps another imperious boundary. \"I know, it's not really a phrase but people who do the inverted commas finger bend thing are pretty annoying,\" says Daniel Seppings. Pretty annoying? That doesn't even come \"close\"...</p> <p><strong>72nd over: England 253-5 (Flintoff 30, Jones 4)</strong> \"'Innit' - as in 'I'll have a burger and fries, innit',\" says Chris Myers. \"As used by white middle-class wannabe homeboys with their hooded tops and too-big jeans.\" Yep, that's in. These people deserve to feel pain.</p> <p><strong>71st over: England 252-5 (Flintoff 30, Jones 4)</strong> Jones away with a lovely flick to midwicket. \"I text him right back',\" fumes Andy Darley. \"No you didn't; you textED. And never again will I respond to anybody who wants to arks me a question. They can ASK but not arks. No way Jose.\"</p> <p><strong>70th over: England 248-5 (Flintoff 30, Jones 0)</strong> Three storming boundaries from Flintoff, who has raced to 30 off 21 balls. More shockers: 'For my sins'; excessive use of exclamation marks. And 'snowed under', which in fairness I am.</p> <p><strong>68th over: England 236-5 (Flintoff 17, Jones 0)</strong> \"'It's bin emotional', a la Frank Butcher in Eastenders,\" says Jon. \"No it hasn't Frank, it's been as teeth-achingly grating as ever.\"</p> <p><strong>WICKET! England 236-5 (Vaughan c Lara b Bravo 66)</strong> Dwayne Bravo picks up another important wicket, as he has done all series. Vaughan was tempted outside off and, driving away from his body, edged to Lara in the slips. </p> <p><strong>67th over: England 235-4 (Vaughan 66, Flintoff 17 [off 13 balls])</strong> Lawson steams in and Vaughan flashes him on the up through the covers. Aah yah! More phrases: 'starter for ten', 'pie-chart-a-go-go' and the Brentish 'guilty'. \"I'm told that throwing shapes is no longer an acceptable dancing form,\" says Giles Newton. \"'Dealing the cards' is the way forward apparently.\" </p> <p><strong>66th over: England 223-4 (Vaughan 61, Flintoff 11)</strong> Delightful leg-glance from Flintoff for four: he's looking in good nick once again. \"I was recently in a meeting where someone was asked to explain the granularity of their argument,\" says Rob Jackson. \"Un-believable.\"</p> <p><strong>And more</strong> \"I had a meeting with an account manager from a major telecoms company last week,\" says Matt Emerson, \"who was in his mid-fifties and used the word wicked without obvious embarrassment. God, how his children must hate him...\"</p> <p><strong>And more</strong> \"'In the loop',\" says Jon Sexton. \"Ironic really as it makes me want to hang myself...\" Honk!</p> <p><strong>Hated phrases - yet more</strong> \"Surely the daddy of them all is 'there's no I in team?'\" says Mike Hammond.</p> <p><strong>Random ABBREVIATIONS even</strong> For the little it's worth, that's what FTLIW meant.</p> <p><strong>65th over: England 216-4 (Vaughan 60, Flintoff 6)</strong> Flintoff hooks Bravo for four, aided by some truly diabolical fielding. There's a sleepy air to the game but - and how't this for a cliche - half an hour of Freddie should wake people up and clear a few bars. \"One-time big brother contestant Jon Tickle is sat opposite talking a bit too loudly on the phone to some tv producer who wants him to do some work,\" says Matt Hall. \"Any ideas on how to shut him up?\" Plenty, none of them printable.</p> <p><strong>64th over: England 211-4 (Vaughan 60, Flintoff 1)</strong> Here's Luke Satchell, and he's a man after my own heart: \"People who say LOL, both on the internet and in real life. I tell you what would make me LOL - people who use this acronym meeting a grizzly end, that's what.\"</p> <p><strong>WICKET! England (Bell 210-4 c Baugh b Lawson 70)</strong> Bell goes, and I said he'd get 68 so that's not a bad call. Lawson got one to bounce and Bell, feeling outside off stump, snicked it through to the keeper. End of a fine debut innings, and here's Freddie.</p> <p><strong>63rd over: England 210-3 (Vaughan 60, Bell 70)</strong> \"I'm on a conference call at the moment and our boss says that we 'punch above our weight',\" grimaces Phil Tyrer. \"WTF????\"</p> <p><strong>62nd over: England 208-3 (Vaughan 60, Bell 69)</strong> More boundaries than my Escape From Colditz board game just now, as Vaughan slams Lawson through the covers. \"E- girlfriend has recently told me that she's gonna 'play hard-ball' over money,\" says Nicholas Parsons. \"I mean!\" My favourite film, for the two of you who asked, has to be Donnie Darko. Sorry I can't print all your emails, incidentally, but they are making me cackle, FTLIW. </p> <p><strong>61st over: England 203-3 (Vaughan 56, Bell 69)</strong> Bell is rolling (no, not tolling) along now - four more as he cuts Bravo behind point. Here's Jonathon Martin: \"Some people (me) occasionally describe dancing as 'Throwing out some Shapes'...\" I call it pulling some moves.</p> <p><strong>60th over: England 198-3 (Vaughan 55, Bell 65)</strong> Bell is flying now: he flicks Lawson supremely for four. THis is the value of picking someone for their Test debut when they're in form. It isn't rocket science, but it's eluded the England selectors for far too long. Until recently. Here are the latest odds from Skybet's Steve Hart: 10/11 England, 11/10 Draw, 8/1 West Indies. I think that's extremely generous - given that Lara's bound to score at least 200 (calm down Brian, it's a dead rubber), and the pitch looks flat, I think they've a very good chance.</p> <p><strong>59th over: England 189-3 (Vaughan 54, Bell 57)</strong> Technical problems as Ian Bell goes to his fifty with a sumptuous off-drive. Then he rocks back to, erm, back-cut Collymore for four. I was wrong: he'll get a ton here. </p> <p><strong>57th over: England 176-3 (Vaughan 53, Bell 46)</strong> While England motor on serenely (I presume), Channel 4 give us a 45-minute horse-racing montage, set to a funky sub-Coors ditty. WHAT THE BLAZES IS WRONG WITH THE WORLD?! \"Burning the candle at both ends,\" says Alex Perkins. \"You'll look silly with wax all down your trousers.\" Even if you're Madonna's lawyer?</p> <p><strong>56th over: England 167-3 (Vaughan 53, Bell 38)</strong> Fifty up for Vaughan with a cherry-pie-in-Twin-Peaks-fine leg glance. \"Amelie,\" says Dominic Smith. \"What a coincidence. I've just bought Amelie on DVD, could somebody tell me if it is worth watching or shall I just go to the pub as usual leaving the film on the side collecting dust?\" It's absolutely brilliant: No2 on my all-time list. Romance, comedy <em> and </em>Audrey Tautou in so-cute-you-couldn't-credit-it more. </p> <p><strong>Horse-racing update</strong> A horse is in the lead, and now another horse has won. \"Someone told me to 'Get with the program' the other day,\" says Richard Leyland. \"How I held back from Falling Down rampage, I don't know...\"</p> <p><strong>55th over: England 161-3 (Vaughan 47, Bell 37)</strong> Didn't see a ball of that over, but the horses at York are looking mighty fine. \"'Keeping it real',\" winces Tamsin Cox. \"What could be worse?\" Andy Fordham balancing on your swingers?</p> <p><strong>54th over: England 159-3</strong> Nicely judged quick single from Bell. It's amazing that Fidel Edwards has only taken one wicket in this series - and now his Test average is pushing 50. A weird one: I rate him. But then I rate Robert Key. Here's Josh Hardie: \"My suggestion would be overuse of the phrase 'you couldn't make it up...' never something that could be levelled at you lot. Oh, and Eh? What? Oh...Eh? What? Oh.\" I wouldn't read today's Fiver, Josh...</p> <p><strong>53rd over: England 158-3</strong> I haven't seen much of Bell before, but he looks nice and nimble on his foot - when the ball is short he dances around like Sugar Ray Leonard in Chaserz. \"I am surrounded by people who talk about 'touching base' with other people,\" says Tim Mowat. It is hell. An unending hell.\"</p> <p><strong>52nd over: England 154-3</strong> Bell hops around to cut Edwards nicely for four. \"Do one,\" offers Tim Young. Bah! I see we've won a gold in yngling - wasn't she the lass on the lifeline in Donnie Darko?</p> <p><strong>51st over: England 147-3 (Vaughan 44, Bell 31)</strong> Plenty of swing and cut for Collymore. Having seen none of the day's play so far I have nothing to offer on the pitch, but the boys in the box reckons it's a belter. \"Worst saying of all,\" begins Ian Johnston. \"'If you're not out on the edge you're taking up too much room'. If they say it, slap them.\" Chill out, dog.</p> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Welcome to this evening's extended session (40 overs!) in which Ian Bell will be cruelly denied a maiden Test century by a dodgy decision from Darrell Hair when he's on 68.</p> <p><strong>This afternoon's riff</strong> Cringeworthy expressions that people think are cool. Prime example: hang loose. You know who you are...</p>",
  "<p>Today, the Oval Test match begins. Normally, apart from a few Thermos-toting obsessives from Dorking intent on getting to the Harleyford Road early for the 10.30 start, that would mean little. In the week that the Olympic flame was ignited and the Premiership kicked off, it should mean nothing: a sideshow in the global sporting funfair. But, happily, this year is different. England are winning, are playing exuberant cricket, and have found a new superstar: Andrew \"Freddie\" Flintoff, the man who has achieved what appeared to be impossible and made cricket sexy again.</p> <p>Since Ian Botham retired more than a decade ago, England have been looking for a new hero. The phrase \"the next Ian Botham\" has been hung around a succession of players' necks and gripped so tightly that they were strangled. David Capel, Derek Pringle, Ronnie Irani. Remember them? Thought not. But Flintoff, after a stuttering start, is living up to the hype. Now 27, he has matured into a destructive batsman who can play long innings, a fiery fast bowler who can disconcert the opposition (witness the way he bounced out the great Brian Lara on Sunday), and a brilliant slip catcher. He is three players in one; the talisman of an increasingly confident team; the hope for the Ashes clash that will dominate next summer. </p> <p>More than that, Flintoff is a player who transcends his sport, one of those rare talents who can attract new converts. Cricket can sometimes seem a trifle slow: Groucho Marx was once taken to Lord's to see a match and, after an hour's play, turned to his host and asked when it was going to start. A Test match can last 30 hours - twice as long as Wagner's Ring cycle. But Flintoff overcomes the prejudice against a long, slow, meandering game that, even after five days (or 10 days in the case of one famous Test in South Africa in 1939), can still end in a draw. He is the sport's great hope for a golden future. </p> <p>Flintoff has been called a \"boy's own hero\", and never was the phrase more appropriate. First, there is the utter simplicity of his approach. When he bats, his principal desire is to hit the ball as hard and as far as possible. He has already struck almost 50 sixes in Test matches and there is no doubt that he will end up as the six-hitting record-holder. Babe Freddie! When he arrives at the crease, his adoring fans start baying for him to smash the ball over the ropes. He has even said that sometimes this puts too much pressure on him, forcing him into wanton aggression too early in his innings. But mostly, he does it anyway: it's the way he plays. </p> <p>There was a very Freddie moment at the Birmingham Test match earlier this month when he launched a six into the upper tier of a stand (while making an extraordinary, match-winning 167). Who should be under the ball but his father, Colin? Dad promptly spilled the catch, for which Flintoff junior gave him a fearful ribbing in his end-of-play interview with Channel 4. Which is the other key point about Flintoff: he is funny, unaffected, unchanged by stardom. He is still the big, brawny boy from Preston who likes a pint and a laugh, and most of all loves the game of cricket. </p> <p>Flintoff is a cricketing Alf Tupper. For those readers who didn't read Victor comic circa 1967, Tupper (\"the Tough of the Track\") was a lovable but tenacious Brit who used to work as a welder, live on fish and chips, and invariably win gold for his country, beating all manner of dodgy Russians, egotistical Americans and Vorsprung durch Technik Germans. It was not enough to win: the winner had to be simple, straightforward, approachable and level-headed, an ordinary bloke like you or me. Win the 1500m? Anyone could do it - just eat an extra portion of cod. </p> <p>Now, of course, it's not cod you have to eat to win gold, but a cocktail of designer drugs dreamed up in California. And Roy of the Rovers is earning \u00a3100,000 a week, shagging his way around the fleshpots of Melchester and playing in a team dominated by footballing mercenaries with unpronounceable names. </p> <p>Cricket hasn't quite succumbed to the 21st century, thank God. The top players do dye their hair, drive sports cars and wear designer sunglasses while they bowl, but they do not indulge in the worst excesses of the modern sportsman. Their saving grace is that they spend so long on the field that they don't have the time to prop up bars or get into fights at nightclubs. </p> <p>Cricket is still played by recognisable human beings. Flintoff is an ordinary genius. Wisden, which this year named him as one of its five cricketers of the year, called him \"a farmhand delighting in the coconut shy\". He brings the characteristics of the village green - a violent swing of the bat, uncomplicated fast bowling, laughter and a sense of well-being - to the Test arena. In an age of paranoia and doubt, Flintoff is liberating, a cold beer on a hot day. If a Test match is, indeed, a sporting Ring cycle, Flintoff is our Siegfried: innocent, fearless, the superhuman shaper of events. </p> <p>Flintoff has only come of age as a cricketer in the past 18 months. He made his debut for England in 1998, but struggled with both bat and ball. He was young, callow, unfit, intimidated by the big names in the England team. His most memorable early moment was when a TV camera panned across the dressing room and spotted a page-three photo in his corner. He was a boy in a man's world. </p> <p>As a youngster, because he was big and immensely powerful, he always played in teams a couple of years above his age group. He still was - and he knew it. After one decent performance against Zimbabwe, he gave himself a public pat on the back. \"All right for a fat lad,\" he said. The humour, self-deprecation and sense of perspective has always been there, in the bad times as well as the good. </p> <p>You only have to see Flintoff interviewed - hands in pockets, smiling, unfazed by the fact that he has just slayed another dragon - to sense that he is rooted. He is unlikely ever to use the third person, as sportsman who get above themselves are sometimes wont to do. </p> <p>In those first years as an England player, Flintoff's \"normality\" was part of the problem: he was too keen on lager and pizzas, not working hard enough at his game. \"Fat Freddie\" was becoming a joke. His manager, \"Chubby\" Chandler, and former Lancashire team-mate Neil Fairbrother read the riot act: he was wasting his talent, was in danger of throwing his career away. He got the message, cut down on the lagers, lost a couple of stone, even took up pilates to strengthen his bad back. </p> <p>This year he has been transformed. His career statistics are still not exceptional: almost 2,000 runs, averaging 32.3 per innings; 85 wickets at a cost of 37.15 runs per wicket. As averages go, they are very average. But this year, he has been phenomenal: a batting average of 55.5 and 30 wickets at 25. Even those figures do not tell the whole story: it is the way he makes his runs, the fire with which he bowls, his playful swagger when he fields. He makes everything seem possible. His team-mates now keep saying they feel they can win from any position, no matter how bleak. They have self-belief. Flintoff is their alchemist. </p> <p>On Monday, it was Flintoff who was at the wicket when England took an unassailable 3-0 lead in the Test series. He had batted sensibly for a couple of hours; then, with victory in sight, he wound himself up and sent the ball into the stratosphere for two huge sixes (where was his father?). To show that he was not just a biffer, he finished the match with a delicate late cut and Old Trafford went wild. A ground on the final day of a Test is often a funereal place: but on this occasion 14,000 had come to celebrate England's new messiah and his team progressing to the promised land. The other Old Trafford is only half a mile away, but for once it was cricket that was getting the attention. </p> <p>His nickname - now universally used except by his mother and his wife-to-be Rachael, who for the moment are sticking with Andrew - was coined by John Stanworth, the coach of the Lancashire second XI. When the strapping 15-year-old turned up one day, Stanworth shouted: \"It's Fred Flintstone.\" It seemed perfect for a larger-than-life figure who would, before the fitness regime, have loved nothing better than to tuck into a dinosaur-burger with extra cheese. </p> <p>The most endearing facet of Flintoff's character is that he is so obviously a team man. His hundred for England in a hopelessly lost cause against South Africa at Lord's last year meant little to him; he could barely bring himself to acknowledge the applause when he was eventually dismissed. </p> <p>Five years ago, the obituarists were sharpening their pens. English cricket appeared to be in its death throes as a national game. \"The script for English cricket now seems to be more like the Book of Job than anything else,\" wrote Wisden editor Matthew Engel in the 2000 edition of the famous almanack. \"The English crisis is now the greatest crisis in world cricket.\" </p> <p>The England team were the worst in the world. Football - both the sport and the soap opera - dominated the media, filled the sports pages to bursting point, was in danger of creating what Engel called a sporting \"monoculture\". County attendances were pathetic (Derbyshire had just over a thousand members, of which 16 were dogs). There was less and less cricket being played in schools, especially state schools. You rarely saw cricket being played in the streets, as you once had.</p> <p>Cricket was deemed slow, irrelevant, meandering; a 19th-century game that offered little to the slick new 21st. Neville Cardus's \"background music to an English summer\" seemed to have no place in the age of rap. It was the game of country vicars and posh blokes with pipes and tweed suits: EW Swanton, CMJ, Blowers; a hangover from the world of squires and blacksmiths. It was history. And then along came Freddie. </p> <p>It would be foolish to ascribe the rebirth of English cricket to one man. Coach Duncan Fletcher must take much credit; ditto former captain Nasser Hussain, whose Taliban-like sense of discipline made England competitive again. Michael Vaughan, the current captain, with his choirboy face and endearing tendency to drop easy catches, is allowing his team to play joyous, uninhibited cricket. Ray Illingworth and the hard-bitten Yorkshire old-timers must wonder what's going on out there.</p> <p>But it is Flintoff who is the symbol of the game's extraordinary renaissance. When he struck the winning runs to wrap up the series win against the West Indies, it was impossible not to share the collective pleasure. Middle-aged men threw their Thermos flasks in the air; young women, abjuring the joys of small-bore shooting on TV, jigged; the many children at Old Trafford dreamed, \"That could be me.\" Alf Tupper had triumphed. It is always said of the great cricketing entertainers that they empty bars. How, these days, the breweries must fear Freddie Flintoff.</p>",
  "Reporters looking into the background of the Vietnam veteran who claimed John Kerry lied about a key military engagement have discovered that his own metal citation backs up Mr Kerry's version of events. <p>Larry Thurlow has been a vocal critic of the Democratic presidential candidate, and in an attack ad paid for by supporters of the president, George Bush, he claimed Mr Kerry was not under enemy fire during an engagement for which both men were awarded the bronze star. </p> <p>Mr Thurlow and Mr Kerry were both navy swift boat captains engaged in the same mission into the Viet Cong-controlled territory on the Mekong Delta on March 13 1969. During the mission, a mine exploded under one of the boats in the flotilla, and a second explosion knocked special forces officer Jim Rassman into the water. </p> <p>Wounded himself, Mr Kerry reached into the water and pulled Mr Rassman to safety. Both he and Mr Rassman maintain they were under enemy fire during the incident, and to this day Mr Rassman credits Mr Kerry with saving his life. </p> <p>Mr Thurlow has loudly insisted that he never heard enemy fire during the incident and that Mr Kerry was lying for his political gain. However Mr Thurlow's own bronze star citation, obtained under Freedom of Information legislation by reporters at the Washington Post, stated decisively that he was under enemy fire that day on the river with Mr Kerry.</p> <p>The citation contains several references to \"enemy small arms and automatic weapons fire\" directed at \"all units\" of the five-boat flotilla. It goes on to praise Mr Thurlow for providing assistance to a damaged swift boat \"despite enemy bullets flying about him.\" Today Mr Kerry called on the White House to condemn criticism of his Vietnam War record, and released a television commercial to promote his version of events. </p> <p>\"All those Viet Cong were shooting at me. I expected to be shot. When he pulled me out of the river, he risked his life to save mine,\" Mr Rassmann says in the 30-second commercial. </p> <p>The White House has refused to call on backers of the attack ads to stop running them. </p> <p>In a prepared remark to firefighters today, Mr Kerry said: \"More than 30 years ago I learned an important lesson. When you're under attack the best thing to do is turn your boat into the attack. That's what I intend to do today.\" </p> <p>Kerry's campaign also arranged to have several members of the navy swift boat crew attend the speech to firefighters. </p> <p>Mr Thurlow is a leading member of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, an anti-Kerry group of Vietnam veterans. He has described Mr Kerry's bronze star citation as \"totally fabricated\" saying, \"I never heard a shot.\" </p> <p>Mr Thurlow, a registered Republican, said he was angry with Mr Kerry for his anti-war activities after his return to the US, especially his claim that US troops committed war crimes with the knowledge of their officers up the chain of command. </p> <p>Members of Mr Kerry's crew have said the Democrat is telling the truth. Mr Rassmann said he has vivid memories of enemies firing at him from both banks.</p> <p>Senior Democrats, including some inside the campaign, have urged Mr Kerry to respond to the criticism, largely Republican sponsored, that has been heaped on his Vietnam service since the Democratic nominee showcased his military service during his national convention last month.</p>",
  "A man who worked undercover for the BBC and Channel Four was jailed for life today for the murder of a father tortured to death in front of his children. <p>James Raven, 44, subjected drug dealer Brian Waters to \"systematic and barbaric torture\" at a farm in Tabley, Cheshire, in June last year. </p> <p>Mr Waters, 44, was beaten, whipped, burned and attacked with a staple gun while his adult son and daughter were made to watch. </p> <p>He died after being hung upside down and sexually assaulted with an iron bar. </p> <p>A jury at Chester crown court found Raven, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, guilty of murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. </p> <p>The jury also convicted 54-year-old John Wilson, of Glossop, Derbyshire, of the same offences. It was Wilson who ordered the attack after falling out with Mr Waters over a debt. </p> <p>Co-defendant Ashley Guishard, 30, of Sale, Greater Manchester, was acquitted. A 27-year-old man from Manchester will face a retrial after the jury failed to reach a verdict. </p> <p>Raven described himself during the eight-week trial as an \"undercover reporter\", although a BBC spokeswoman described him today as a \"covert operative\" who did not take editorial decisions. </p> <p>Raven and his cousin Christopher More, who is still wanted by police in connection with Mr Waters' death, earned up to \u00a3500 a day working on undercover assignments for the BBC and Channel 4. </p> <p>Over two years, Raven worked on programmes including the BBC's MacIntyre Uncovered and Crooked Britain, as well as Channel 4's Sleepers, infiltrating gangs involved in car crime, drugs and counterfeiting. </p> <p>BBC producers knew Raven, who is heavily tattoed with words such as \"maniac\" and \"psycopath\", had a previous conviction for violence but they believed he was a reformed character, the court heard. </p> <p>Mr Justice Poole sentenced both Raven and Wilson to life imprisonment with a recommendation they serve at least 24 years for the murder. He also sentenced them to 14 years for each conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm, to run concurrently. </p> <p>\"These crimes were exceptionally sadistic. The violence used was both gratuitous and extreme and was characterised by the humiliation and degradation of Brian Waters before he died, the judge said. </p> <p> \"Whatever your precise intention, no man could have survived those injuries and Brian Waters did not. With its overtones of greed, sadism and torture, this was a very serious case.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the glories of being a parent, particularly, perhaps, being a father, is that for years you can bask in the warmth of your children's belief that you are all-powerful, that you can solve all problems and overcome all obstacles. What a terrible moment it is when they discover that you have feet of clay.</p> <p>Breaking my neck, particularly in the back of beyond in Bolivia, was a comprehensive demonstration of fallibility. \"Don't worry,\" I said, \"I don't care too much about my legs, but I will get my arms and upper body back, you'll see.\" Some hope! </p> <p>My own sense of invulnerability is badly dented. Yes, against all the odds it had survived since my teenage years. I once fell 60 ft from a rockface in the Llanberis Pass in Snowdonia, landed on my feet, did a forward roll down a scree slope, and survived with a few scrapes and bruises! </p> <p>However, now that I am at the mercy of others I find myself panicking at the slightest thing and I am having to learn how to calm myself when it happens. </p> <p>When I was lying in a hospital bed in La Paz I became convinced that one of the nurses wanted to kill me. I was choking on the ventilator pipes in my mouth but she refused to respond to the only sound I could make - a clicking noise with my tongue. I complained (via my wife, Val, who could read my lips) but they chose to rely on the nurse's experience rather than my conviction. They claimed I was delirious - Catch 22. </p> <p>I was transferred from Bolivia to Sao Paulo, Brazil, in a plane belonging to the then Bolivian president, Hugo Banzer. He was one of those South American generals who retained power by alternating dubious elections with coups d'\u00e9tat - not the sort of person with whom a lifelong socialist likes to hobnob. The presidential plane turned out to be his third choice, a rather dilapidated single-engined six-seater. Flying through the Andes (the plane couldn't rise above the mountains) and across the Amazon jungle, rather than being an adventure, was nerve-racking. I knew who would be the first to be cannibalised by the other passengers should we go down. </p> <p>The feeling of vulnerability intensified when I was back in Britain, admitted to intensive care in Derby. Listening to the news that evening, I heard that an air ambulance, just like the one that had ferried me from London, had crashed on its way to Liverpool airport. The very next item on the news concerned a nurse who was suspected of murdering her elderly patients as they lay helpless in bed. Not one of my best evenings. </p> <p>It got worse when I was in the spinal unit. There was a patient who was a borderline psychotic, subject to unexpected rages. I was lying in bed alone in the room when he came in. Something annoyed him and he began to throw furniture about. I was acutely aware that I was incapable, quite literally, of raising a finger to defend myself. Fortunately, something distracted him and he wandered off. </p> <p>But I most became aware of my vulnerability and loss of status during a party thrown by my teenage son, Barney. Everything was going well until six older gatecrashers arrived. They refused to leave and after an argument between two of them - a bloke and his girlfriend - they started to throw food and drink about and to threaten Barney and some of his friends. </p> <p>In the old days I would have intervened to control and calm situations like these, but, of course, I was already in bed and it would have taken me about half an hour to be dressed, hoisted into a wheelchair and taken downstairs. It would have been interesting to see what sort of authority someone in a wheelchair would have exerted. </p> <p>As it was, Val took the lead, assisted by a visiting male friend fortuitously present. Even so, it took two visits by the police to clear them from the house followed by a confrontation lasting three-quarters of an hour in the street outside. Dustbins were tipped over as the interlopers retreated sullenly, and finally two of them were arrested. </p> <p>\"Don't worry, be cool,\" said Barney, \"this sort of thing happens quite often at parties.\" </p> <p>I have reflected long and hard upon this metamorphosis from \"he who is in control\" to \"he who must be protected\". Women must feel as vulnerable as this most of their lives, while men can live with the illusion of invulnerability, sporting the odd trophy black eye to demonstrate their toughness. I suppose if I try to \"positively reframe\" the experience (I've been seeing a psychologist) I might be able to come to think of it as a liberation. Really, I might.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edguiton@yahoo.com\">edguiton@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, said today that he would push ahead with his country's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip despite a stinging setback to the plan from his Likud party. <p>\"The prime minister is determined to continue with the disengagement plan and the diplomatic process and he will try to build a stable coalition,\" Mr Sharon's office said.</p> <p>Mr Sharon has been courting the opposition Labour party in an effort to shore up support in parliament for his withdrawal plan, but a Likud convention voted overwhelmingly last night to bar him from inviting Labour into the government as part of his efforts. </p> <p>Although Mr Sharon insisted that last night's vote was not binding, it could endanger the pullout, which he hopes to complete next year. He says the moves are necessary to boost Israel's security and preserve its Jewish majority. </p> <p>The vote was overwhelming, with 60% in favour of banning Labour from the government. Hardline Likud members oppose such an alliance, fearing it would involve further concessions to the Palestinians. </p> <p>It was another major setback for Mr Sharon from the party. In May, a non-binding Likud referendum rejected the withdrawal by a 60-40 margin. The plan also cost him his parliamentary majority. </p> <p> Opponents warned that following the vote, Mr Sharon would not be able to approach Labour.</p> <p>\"Sharon cannot ignore the wishes of his party,\" said Likud's Michael Ratzon. </p> <p>Labour denounced the results, saying Likud had become \"a movement that destroys all chances to bring about an end to violence in the region\". </p> <p>\"Elections must be called immediately,\" said a statement from the party, which advocates an Israeli pullout from Gaza and most of the West Bank in exchange for peace with the Palestinians.</p> <p>General elections are due by 2006.</p> <p><b>Court upholds decision</b></p> <p> In a small boost for Mr Sharon today, Israel's supreme court upheld the decision of the country's attorney general to clear him of corruption.</p> <p>The attorney general, Meni Mazuz, decided in June not to indict Mr Sharon and his son Gilad in a bribery case involving a failed real estate deal, but several members of the Israeli parliament had called on the supreme court to overturn the ruling. </p> <p>The case concerned a plan by businessman David Appel - a close associate of Mr Sharon's - to develop a tourist project on a Greek island. Mr Appel has been indicted for allegedly bribing Mr Sharon and one of his sons to obtain preferential treatment. Mr Sharon was foreign minister at the time of the payments. </p> <p>The state attorney had recommended charging Mr Sharon with accepting a bribe and included a draft indictment in its report to Mr Mazuz. </p> <p>But although Mr Appel has been charged with bribing Mr Sharon, under Israeli law the prosecution would have to prove criminal intent on the latter's part in order to convict him of accepting a bribe.</p> <p><b>Arafat refuses to sign</b></p> <p> Meanwhile, the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, rebuffed the latest challenge to his authority, refusing to sign anti-corruption legislation demanded by other Palestinian politicians. </p> <p>In a speech to parliament yesterday, Mr Arafat admitted to making \"mistakes\" and pledged to clean up the Palestinian Authority, but in a \"stormy and tense\" follow-up meeting he told pro-reform lawmakers \"that his speech ... was enough and that there is no need for any signatures\", said Azmi Shouabi, one of the participants in the meeting. </p> <p>Mr Shouabi said the lawmakers had agreed to meet with Mr Arafat one more time before submitting a report to parliament next week. </p> <p>Mr Arafat has been under intense local and international pressure to reform his government and relinquish some of his powers, but he has repeatedly balked from acting.

  "<p>The government is considering lifting the bar on restrictions which prevent tiers of council staff from standing for political office, under proposals published today.</p> <p>The move is one of several possible changes being floated as part of the review into the regulatory framework governing the political activities of local government staff, including the possibility of council officers seeking election as elected members within their own council. </p> <p>The three-month consultation will gauge responses on whether current restrictions on political activities of staff are heavy-handed and continue to deliver a politically impartial council workforce which can command the confidence of members of all political persuasions.</p> <p>Under existing rules, council staff employed in a mutiplicity of posts are denied the right to hold political office either as councillor, MP or even as a committee member of a political party.</p> <p>Chief executives, chief officers and their deputies, monitoring officers, coupled with anyone who works either in an advisory or press officer role, are also barred from acting as an election agent or sub-agent, or engaging in public or written communication in support of a political party.</p> <p>Staff earning above a salary threshold of \u00a332,127 are similarly exempt from engaging in political activity.</p> <p>But critics say the stipulations take in ordinary officers earning below the earnings threshold but who hold advisory posts, such as officers who work with scrutiny committees under modern governance arrangements.</p> <p>The consultation document lays out a range of possible changes to enable political activity for all but most senior council staff, by raising the salary threshold to reduce the number of posts affected.</p> <p>The government is also considering offering council staff the opportunity to participate in national politics, equivalent to the rule which allows civil servants to take part in local politics. </p> <p>However, council permission would be required, and it would need to consider the sensitivity of the post and whether that person advises members.</p> <p>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) is also seeking views on whether the existing maximum paid leave threshold for council officers who hold elected office in another local authority should be reduced, or increased, and whether they could stand for election in their own council.</p> <p>The 12-month rule which prevents a former elected member from seeking a local government officer post could also be dropped.</p> <p>Scotland has paved the way under the recently published Local Governance (Scotland) Act, by scaling down the one-year ban to three months. The ODPM recognises the local authority landscape has changed since the 12-month ban was first introduced, with one local authority providing services to another, thereby limiting career opportunities for former elected members in the first 12 months.</p> <p>The ODPM also launched today a draft code of conduct for local authority staff, in line with the code already published for elected members, under the Local Government Act 2000. </p> <p>The proposed code seeks to establish a set of core principles that underpin the concept of public service and will cover the 1.5 million local government workforce, other than teachers and firefighters, who already have a separate code of conduct.</p> <p>The launch of the consultation into politically restricted posts coincides with a publication by the local government thinktank, the Local Government Information Unit (LGIU), which has been campaigning for a review of existing legislation.</p> <p>Tracy Gardiner, the LGIU's policy officer and author of Barred from Politics, said the restrictions on political activity should be kept for only top ranking council officials, with the proposed code of conduct acting as a safeguard for lower ranking officers wishing to participate in local democracy.</p> <p>\"The present political restrictions on many public sector workers are excessive,\" she said. \"They go way beyond the reasonable and limited set of restrictions that are necessary in this sphere, to the point of unreasonably restricting the political freedoms that are taken for granted in a democracy.

  "<p>Ecstatic A-level students today ploughed on with their celebrations despite a political row over standards and reforms bubbling away.</p> <p>Some 250,000 students up and down the country were celebrating the highest pass rate - 96% - and the most A grades achieved - 22.4%.</p> <p>Among the tales of triplets gaining nine A grades and 13-year-old child prodigies emerged stories of everyday achievement. </p> <p>Richard Killip, 18, from Bradford College, in Yorkshire, today became the first person in his family to get A-levels, achieving three As and a C. He also became the first from his college to gain a place at Cambridge University. </p> <p>Speaking from a pub in Bradford, he told EducationGuardian.co.uk he was \"ecstatic\". </p> <p>\"I come from a working class background. I do think it has become more accessible anyway for more people to go to more universities.\"</p> <p>He added: \"But I couldn't tell you what the reason is for me doing this without sounding big headed.\"</p> <p>Zoe Pearson, 19, is \"very, very relieved\" she achieved two As and a C, which guarantees her a place at Sheffield to study medicine. She wants to be a doctor because she has quite a lot of experience of the profession. Zoe suffers from Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, a chronic pain disorder that causes pain and spasms.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at City and Islington sixth-form college in London, Suleman Rahman, who wants to study medicine at University College London, was almost lost for words after achieving three As, in biology, chemistry and maths. \"I'm just really happy, that's all I can say. I'm just really happy now.\" </p> <p>Anh Vu, who currently works part-time in a chemist and wants to train as a pharmacist, was jubilant. Despite dropping a grade in her maths A-level, she called her first choice university to see if she could still take up her place. \"London School of Pharmacy have accepted me. I'm really happy.\" she said.</p> <p>Simao Paxi-Cato, who collected three As and a B, was more laid back about his results. \"Any other year, it would probably have been the four As, but it's not a problem. I didn't work that hard and I got good grades, so it's all right.\" </p> <p>Simao, who was born in Angola, has a place at Christ Church College, Oxford to study law. \"For once I'm going to have to actually do some work. It's going to be a new experience, but it's positive.\"</p> <p>For those who had done less well, the university admissions service, Ucas, announced its Clearing service had got off to a quick start, with thousands of students already using the service to scramble for a place.</p> <p>However, the pride felt among thousands of A-level students across the country was in marked contrast to the growing calls to reform the exam so universities can distinguish between the top crop of A-graders. </p> <p>According to reports today, Mike Tomlinson, the ex-Ofsted chief charged with overhauling exams and the curriculum, will recommend that the government introduce an extended essay on top of A-levels, which universities could read online. </p> <p>The idea was first mooted in Mr Tomlinson's interim report, published at the beginning of the year, and is believed to be in the final draft of his report, due for publication in the autumn. </p> <p>The schools standards minister, David Miliband, who has already acknowledged that universities are struggling to pick the best candidates, said today he would take the option \"very seriously\". </p> <p>Mr Tomlinson has so far insisted that any change to the system would be phased in over 10 years. But if the pass rate continues to increase at the same pace it will hit 100% within that time period. Some are now calling for reform to happen more quickly.</p> <p>The Tories said they would stop students from resitting modules in a bid to protect the quality of the qualification. </p> <p>The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said: \"Olympic athletes do not get a second or third go at the 100 metres if they don't like the result, and the same logic should apply in education.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats solution would be to award more points for shortage subjects in a bid to encourage more students to take them. The point system is used when universities give conditional offers of a place. </p> <p>But the party's education spokesman, Phil Willis, said a 10-year programme of reform was too long.</p> <p>\"The government has said it plans to introduce this new system in 10 years' time. This is too long. We simply cannot repeat this debate over A-levels every year for the next 10 years. The government should introduce the new system during the course of the next parliament.\"</p> <p>Previous reports have indicated that Mr Tomlinson will recommend that the A-level A grade be split into four to distinguish between the best candidates. But the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, David Hart, said yesterday this would simply create four more grade boundaries for people to dispute. </p> <p>The option favoured by the exam boards is for universities to have access to the individual marks for the modules that make up A-levels. Yesterday, Ellie Johnson Searle, director of the Joint Council for Qualifications, which issued the results, confirmed it had been meeting with Ucas to discuss the option.</p>",
  "<p>Union officials and British Airways managers were meeting today to discuss the airline's new offer in an attempt to avert a threatened strike next weekend.</p> <p>Ed Blisset of the GMB union said he was going into crucial talks with an \"open and flexible mind\" and wanted to negotiate a \"reasonable\" deal that he could recommend to his members. </p> <p>Mr Blisset said he hoped to \"hone\" a new offer from the company worth \u00a31,000 for every worker if sickness absence was halved. But he again ruled out binding arbitration to break the deadlock because he wanted workers to have a chance to vote on any pay agreement. </p> <p>Leaders of the GMB, the Transport and General Workers' Union (T&amp;G) and Amicus were meeting BA officials following a vote for industrial action by the GMB and T&amp;G that threatened travel chaos at Heathrow and other airports over next week's long bank holiday weekend.</p> <p>Mike Street, BA's director of operations, said today he was \"disappointed\" that the T&amp;G had set the strike date and that unions were refusing to hold a ballot on the new offer. </p> <p>\"We will talk for as long as it takes but I urge them to put this to their members. If we fail today, I reiterate an offer I made three weeks ago - I am prepared to put it to independent arbitration, binding on BA and on the unions.

The T&amp;G said about 700 United baggage handlers and check-in staff at Heathrow had agreed to a walkout. </p> <p>No date for strike action had been set but union officials were meeting today to plan further action. </p> <p>\"Today's message to United Airlines is that our members have supported you through recent difficult times but we need to have a stronger commitment on pay for the future,\" said the T&amp;G's regional industrial organiser, Jo Jacques. </p> <p>BA initially made an offer of an 8.5% pay rise over three years and then added \u00a31,000 in exchange for a reduction in absences from sickness, which at BA is higher than the national average.</p>",

  "More than 8,000 women are working as prostitutes in brothels, saunas and massage parlours in London, a report released today estimates. <p>Three quarters of them are foreign, with many smuggled into the country from eastern Europe and Asia as sex slaves.</p> <p>Criminal gangs are increasingly turning to trafficking prostitutes because the financial gain for them is similar to the drug trade but the sentences are more lenient.</p> <p>The Sex In The City report by the Poppy Project charity focuses on \"off-street\" prostitution. The six-month investigation on which it is based found 730 brothels operating in the capital and 66 supposedly legitimate lap-dancing clubs where dancers were offering sex to clients. </p> <p>London boroughs had an average of 19 sites where sex could be bought, with between four and eight women on average working at each location.</p> <p>The report's author, Sandra Dickson, said: \"The off-street sex industry is largely ignored in most discussions of prostitution, yet the women working in it are also vulnerable to being exploited by violent and abusive pimps and traffickers. </p> <p>\"Women trafficked into prostitution told us they worked alongside other trafficked women all over London. These places are on our local high streets and they're not a bit of fun for the lads.\"</p> <p>The report is the first to provide a snapshot of off-street prostitution across all London boroughs in saunas, massage parlours and businesses that advertise personal services in local papers.</p> <p>Last year, the Metropolitan police's clubs and vice unit took 300 girls and women, including 10 children, out of brothels. Only 19% were British. The rest were from eastern Europe (25%), south east Asia (13%), western Europe (12%) and Africa (2%). Country by country, the largest numbers were from Thailand, Russia, Brazil and Kosovo. Superintendent Chris Bradford said: \"It's like a slave market.\"</p> <p>The report says it is not possible to estimate how many women in the London sex industry were trafficked into prostitution. Interviews with women and information from sexual health outreach agencies suggest that there are more women under varying degrees of control in the sex industry than previously estimated.</p> <p>Women smuggled in are often raped by their captors before being set to work and have their passports and travel documents taken away so they cannot flee.</p> <p>They are frequently forced to live in terrible conditions, sleeping on floors, and are then farmed out and moved around the capital. Women can be sold between brothels for up to \u00a310,000 and may be sold on four or five times. Some are even advertised on the internet, which police believe is fuelling demand for trafficking.</p>",
  "<p>Meet Lil, Helen and Kate Armstrong. It is very likely the identical 18-year-old triplets will adorn tomorrow's front pages. For today they received nine A grades between them and are destined for Cambridge.</p> <p>The three, who studied their A-levels at Truro College in Cornwall, have opted for different subjects - medicine, law and natural sciences. They are believed to be the first triplets to secure places at the university in one year. </p> <p>Helen, who will be studying law at Corpus Christi College, and hopes to become a solicitor or barrister, said: \"I am speechless - it's just a great relief to finally know we're all going.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere, William Wheeler, from Magdalen College school in Oxford, got eight top grades: six As at A-level and a further two Advanced Extension Awards. Two years ago he got 16 top grades in his GCSEs, prompting the Sun to describe him as \"Britain's brainiest boy\". He's now destined for Magdalen College, Oxford University. </p> <p>Asked what he thought about the annual row over A-levels, Williams said: \"I think it's a bit harsh. The debate comes up at a time when everyone has just got their results. It is important that the debate happens, because it is important that standards are maintained, but it is a bit harsh that it comes up at this particular time.\"</p> <p>But does he think the exams are as hard as they used to be? \"Probably not, because I've seen A-level papers from 20 years ago and they seem to be much harder. They seem to have much tougher questions requiring more independent thought.\" </p> <p>Adam Buckland, 13, from St Albans in Hertfordshire, got a C in computing, after a year's part-time study. He's got his priorities straight: he's looking forward to a career in computer games. </p> <p>Adam is this year's success story from Ryde College, in Watford, Hertfordshire, which is famous for coaching young people through exams. </p> <p>The teenager is not the youngest person to pass an A-level. That honour is believed to be held by Ganesh Sittampalam, who got an A in maths in 1988 when he was nine years and four months old. </p> <p>But today's A-level stories are not all prodigy or private school. </p> <p>Rosie Green will start at Blackpool and Fylde College in September on a creative writing, English language and literature degree course. The 23-year-old, from Blackpool, who gave birth to Jake, now four, when she was 19, got A grades in English literature and history and a B in English language at the same college. </p> <p>She said: \"I've always wanted to go to university and I've always been academic. I've always been driven by the fact I wanted to earn enough to give Jake a good life.\" </p> <p>Zoe Pearson, 19, is \"very, very relieved\". Although she didn't get the two As and a B needed to get into Leeds, her two As and a C will guarantee her a place to do medicine at Sheffield. She wants to be a doctor because, she says, she has quite a lot of experience of the profession. Zoe suffers from Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, a chronic pain disorder that causes pain and spasms. She is a wheelchair user. </p> <p>\"I have regular operations at a hospital in Sheffield and am on quite a lot of drugs to keep the pain under control,\" she explained. During her studies she's worked in a pharmacy and a GP's surgery, volunteered at a medical centre and ran a support group for young people who share her condition. </p> <p>Today, at New College in Nottingham, where she took her A-levels, she described the atmosphere as \"very nervous and excited\". But there's a great deal of pride too. \"My college is fantastic, they've been really, really supportive. I'd definitely choose to come here again.\"</p> <p>Soleiman Aria, 20, barely spoke a word of English when he first arrived in this country in 2001. Today he said it was a \"dream come true\" to have been offered a place at Cambridge. After achieving two As in chemistry and maths and two Bs in biology and physics, he is now heading to the ivory towers of King's College, to study medicine.</p> <p>\"I never thought this day would come. There are no words to describe how I feel today,\" he said. Soleiman, the eldest of four children, fled his country three years ago, leaving his family behind in Kabul. </p> <p>\"I did not speak much English when I first came here and I was living alone with no family support, but I thought I have nothing to lose and so I will give it a go,\" he added. </p> <p>\"Brilliant\" was how 18-year-old Marie Cawley described achieving her three As at A-level. And \"brilliant\" is how the Stoke on Trent College student describes the medical course she is going to study at Keele University. \"They have a lot of clinical attachments and they do problem-based learning. I did half an hour there on the open day and I couldn't believe how much I learned. I love their kind of learning.\"</p> <p>Marie has spent a lot of time in hospital since she was a child, having been born with a dislocated hip. \"The atmosphere that the doctors and nurses create around you is brilliant. They've got a lot of time for you and I want to pay that back,\" she said.</p> <p>Richard Killip, 18, from Bradford College is celebrating three As and a C today. He's also celebrating being the first person in his family to get A-levels. Today's results have given him a place at Cambridge to study rural economies and environment studies. No one at his college remembers there being a successful application to Oxbridge before.</p> <p>Speaking form the pub, he said he was \"ecstatic\". </p> <p>\"I come from a working class background. I do think it has become more accessible anyway for more people to go to more universities; that's got a lot to do with it. But I couldn't tell you what the reason is for me doing this without sounding big headed.\"</p> <p>Raymond Catterill, from Leeds, left his strict Catholic school at 15 with no qualifications in 1950. Now aged 68 he's got his English A-level from Cross Keys Learning Centre in Leeds. Last year he passed an A-level in English literature. </p> <p>He said: \"I left school at 15. It's what people of my station did then. We just went straight into work. Qualifications weren't that important then. You didn't have any expectations. But I always wanted to learn the basics again. I'm so pleased to have passed and now I looking forward to going to university.\" </p> <p>He's hoping to win a place at Leeds University to study a part-time degree in English literature and theology. </p> <p>Emmanuel College in Gateshead, the academy school sponsored by the Christian-based Emmanuel Schools Foundation, which hit the headlines when it was reported to be teaching creationism, also had much to celebrate. </p> <p>Headed up by Harpreet Sandhu, the college's top student with four A grades at A-level, the successful cohort included head girl Roxzanna Robson, who is bound for Oxford University to read law after achieving three As and Francesca Foreman, who will read modern foreign languages at Oxford University after gaining three As at A-level and an A at AS-level.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Northerner, Guardian Unlimited's weekly digest of the best of the northern papers. <p><b>PLAIN CHOCOLATE TRUTH</b></p> <p>The Westmorland Gazette carries on its front page a strange picture of a man pointing to a brown top hat on his head. This turns out to be Andrew Wilson, owner of the company that makes Kendal Mint Cake (not to mention chocolate sheep droppings). The hat, according to the caption, is made of chocolate.</p> <p>Wilson, smarting from being fined GBP7,500 for infringing EU rules on the disposal of waste packaging, says he will eat this hat if he finds that European companies are obliged to stick to the rules as rigidly as those in Britain.</p> <p>He told the paper that ever-changing rules from Brussels were strangling British businesses. \"The regulations we have to comply with constantly change quite dramatically - it is as though they are making them up as they go along,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We are trying to stick to the law so I think that that counts for something. But there are a lot of companies within our own industry in other EU states and they are not having to abide by the same stringent rules.</p> <p>\"If anyone can prove that they are doing the same form filling as we are, then I will eat my chocolate hat. We have already spoken to some manufacturers in these countries and when I ask them if they have complied with the directives they just shrug their shoulders.\"</p> <p>Wilson's company also produces cans of Lakeland fresh air.

He is also a former northern lawnmower racing champion. </p> <p>\"We want to reach around 100mph because anything lower would be too easy to beat,\" he told the Daily Post. \"The biggest problem is not the speed, it's keeping the machine in a straight line for that distance, because they aren't built to travel that fast.</p> <p>\"Ideally you would try to get an aerodynamic shape, something that is low and long, but the racing rules state you can't change the shape - it must be recognisable as a lawnmower.\"</p> <p>The Americans have already topped 100mph, but British enthusiasts are sniffy about their achievements.</p> <p>\"The Americans are not using real lawnmowers, they just take bits of lawnmowers and stick them on a big engine,\" said John Gavin, president of the British Lawnmower Racing Association. \"It's like having the world's fastest fried egg or the world's fastest wig.

Unfortunately, close reading of the Liverpool Echo's story shows that Ms Jones's epic swim was not in the aquatics centre in Athens but in her local pool in Perth. The Australian one, not the Scottish one.</p> <p>And Ms Jones has not been from Bootle for some time: she left Merseyside for Australia after marrying a sailor in 1934. She is also 94, which makes her a few years older than most of the competitors in Greece.</p> <p>But let's not knock her achievement: the previous record for the 50m freestyle in her age group stood at a dawdling 1min 55 secs. It's not clear from the Echo, but it seems she may have raced only against the clock.</p> <p>\"When I broke the record, I had no one to compete against because they had all retired,\" she said. \"I wasn't thinking about the record when I was competing. I just wanted to win points for the team. I was surprised when I found I had broken it. I just want to keep swimming.\"</p> <p>Her world record has now been officially confirmed by the Australian Union of Senior Swimming Masters.</p> <p>__________________________________</p> <p>An actor from a German company performing a spectacular piece of outdoor theatre had to be taken to hospital with burns during a show in Leeds, the Yorkshire Post reports. </p> <p>Theatre Titanick specialises in building its own version of the unsinkable liner and then letting it sink beneath lots of water after its collision with the iceberg.</p> <p>In Leeds, actor Holger Teupel's clothes caught fire as he stoked the ship's boiler. \"Flames shot out, setting fire to material covering his right arm, shoulder and around his neck,\" reported the YP.</p> <p>The flames were quickly put out by fellow actors and Teupel, now in hospital in Wakefield, was not seriously hurt.

  "<p>Older people in the south-east of England will be invited to share their homes with young single job seekers as part of the government's strategy to overhaul adult social care, it emerged today.</p> <p>The community care minister, Stephen Ladyman, believes that the \"homeshare\" scheme will help prevent elderly or disabled people from feeling lonely and isolated while providing young job seekers with low cost or free housing.</p> <p>Mr Ladyman told the Independent the plan would be unveiled in the green paper on adult social care due to be published in the autumn.</p> <p>\"You do something about the housing problem and the fact that young people need a bit of help to get their first job; and you have got somebody bringing a little bit of quality into an older person's life,\" he told the paper.</p> <p>The initiative has been pioneered by the charity Homeshare International, which runs homeshare projects in eight countries including the UK.</p> <p>Each homeshare is effectively an exchange of services, with the homeowner offering accommodation in return for an agreed number of hours help and support. This may include help with cooking, gardening, shopping, teaching computer skills or simply offering companionship and the security of a night-time presence. </p> <p>But the chief executive of Homeshare International, Andy Murphy, cast doubt on Mr Ladyman's proposals to extend the scheme.</p> <p>He said that the idea to use young job seekers as homesharers could be unwise as they could lack the maturity and stability to provide support to older people.</p> <p>\"I would have some concerns,\" he said. \"We tend not to place people under 23. We want people who are relatively stable themselves and in full-time work or education. </p> <p>\"They tend to be young professionals trying to get established in a new career in London and don't see homesharing as a way out of their difficulties or just as a form of cheap accommodation.\"</p> <p>The first UK homeshare programme was set up in 1993 and there are now five across the country. The main spur to these projects was the need to support older people in their own homes, according to a Homeshare International report last year. </p> <p>Among those involved is the jazz musician and entertainer George Melly who has taken in a homesharer called Desdemona. </p> <p>Other projects help to meet the needs of highly dependent older people, including a deafblind woman who was supported at home until her death at 101. Most homeowners involved in the UK schemes are women in their 80s who live alone. Some have a relative living with them or have other helpers or carers.</p> <p>Gary FitzGerald, chief executive of the charity Action on Elder Abuse, said the safety and security of older people must be of paramount concern if the scheme was to be extended along the lines suggested by Mr Ladyman.</p> <p>\"Like everyone else, older people can be susceptible to being conned. I wouldn't suggest this idea out of hand - I can see the benefits - but would like to see what safety and security measures would be in place.\"</p> <p>Homeshare International schemes are either run on a \"counselling\" model, where the coordinators screen potential homesharers, match them, negotiate a contract and provide ongoing support and supervision, or on a \"referral\" model, where applicants are interviewed and left to make arrangements themselves with suggested matches.</p> <p>Mr Murphy said that homesharers went through telephone and face-to-face interviews and background checks, including with the Criminal Records Bureau, before being matched with older people. They were visited weekly in the first month of a new homeshare and once a month thereafter. He added that young job seekers would probably require more intensive vetting and supervision.</p> <p>The Department of Health was unable to give any further details about the proposals. But a spokeswoman said she imagined the vetting procedures would be rigorous.</p>",
  "Choice is the current policy buzzword: choice of schools for children, choice within the NHS, and choice of delivery for our meals on wheels. But as this week's Guardian/ICM poll showed, there is one area of public life where people would definitely like to see more choice: at work. <p>In April 2003, the government gave working parents with children under the age of six or disabled children under the age of 18 the right to request flexible working arrangements. The present arrangements are quite limited, with the burden on the employee to make the case for change, and no legal requirement for the employer to consent (although so far eight out of 10 applications have been accepted by employers). </p> <p>However, the need for work-life balance is important and relevant to those without small children. For example, there are nearly five million carers in the UK who would benefit from a more flexible approach to work. Those without family obligations also benefit from more leisure time; with more control over their own time workers are healthier, happier and more engaged citizens. </p> <p>Creating a more flexible work environment is not just an employee perk. Evidence shows that where companies offer more flexible arrangements for employees, the benefits are manifold: increased productivity, improved recruitment and retention, lower absenteeism. It allows for better planning and time management for both organisations and individuals - and where home working is an option, vastly reduced overheads. Several case studies have proved the case for business efficiency gains. </p> <p>BT saved \u00a352m in overheads by introducing home working. Retention has also improved, with 98% of female employees returning to work after maternity leave. Research by Cambridge's Judge Institute of Management also shows that quality of service improves when people have a better work-life balance. More choice seems to result in better employees. </p> <p>Under the umbrella of flexible working, there are myriad choices for both employers and employees: part-time hours, part-year contracts such as term-time and compressed hours (e.g. working full-time hours in a 4-day week); annual hours contracts; job share, home working, teleworking, core hours with flexi-time. </p> <p>Working flexibly is sometimes seen as a middle class privilege only suitable for certain professions. However, since flexible working is not constrained to shortened hours, some level of employee choice is possible in almost all industry sectors, without compromising business demands.</p> <p>In the retail sector, shops have weighted staffing to suit the business as well as employees with more workers at lunchtime than at the start of the day - which is generally quieter - allowing for essential activity such as the school run or a lie-in.</p> <p>In manufacturing industries, annual hours contracts can be used to match peaks and troughs of demand as well as create employee benefit. With such a breadth of choice available, both businesses and employees should be able to achieve happier and more productive working environments.</p> <p>My employer, the Social Market Foundation thinktank, has been able to put the policy into action, with staffing arrangements including four-day weeks, flexible work hours, and teleworking which allows employees live access to the office network regardless of whether they are in Croydon or the C\u00f4te d'Azur. </p> <p>According to a Personnel Today report, nearly two-thirds of UK organisations support proposals extending current flexible working legislation to other employers. However, the Confederation of British Industry has suggested that the government is \"getting carried away\" with the flexible working agenda</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://www.irsemploymentreview.com/\">IRS employment review</a> also suggests that the law, rather than a culture change, is driving the flexible work agenda; the primary motivation for offering family-friendly hours was the law in 93% of cases. (Interestingly, one of the drawbacks of the flexible working arrangements, identified by human resources managers in the same survey, is the resentment from non-parent co-workers.) </p> <p>The Department for Trade and Industry is strongly behind the policy, but is adopting a non-legislative approach. With the law only pertaining to a small minority of workers, a sea change is unlikely. The current legislation is set for review within two years, when hopefully the government will look to broaden the legislation. The \"right to request\" needs to be extended to more, if not all workers, if flexible working is to be a viable choice for most employees.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Jcassidy@smf.co.uk\">Jcassidy@smf.co.uk</a></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Jacqueline Cassidy is conference manager at the <a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk\">Social Market Foundation</a> (and is based on the C\u00f4te d'Azur, southern France)</p>",

  "<p>Voluntary organisations have called for criteria to define \"public benefit\" in Scottish law that would strip private schools of their charitable status and tax breaks - and could lead to sharp divergence from English law.</p> <p>The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) has called for a clear framework to assess what is and what is not a charity in its response to the Scottish executive's consultation on the draft charities and trustees (Scotland) bill.</p> <p>Its suggestions would mean a more radical approach to testing the public benefit offered by charities than that proposed in the English draft charities bill now under consideration by a joint committee in the Westminster parliament.</p> <p>Debate in Westminster has focused on the effect of new legislation on charities that charge high fees, such as private schools and hospitals. </p> <p>The charities minister, Fiona Mactaggart, has pledged that these charities will have to prove they offer a public benefit in order to retain their charitable status and tax breaks.</p> <p>But public benefit is left undefined in the English draft bill. Instead it will be up to the Charity Commission to carry out the public benefit tests - a position that could be jeopardised by the commission's stated view that the new legislation would not change the charitable status of private schools because it would not alter existing case law. </p> <p>As a non-ministerial body, the commission will be at liberty to follow its own interpretation, which could render the public benefit test - the cornerstone of the legislation - meaningless. </p> <p>Former health secretary Alan Milburn, the chairman of the Westminster parliamentary committee, last month branded the situation a \"dog's breakfast\".</p> <p>Members of the Westminster committee have raised the possibility of including in the draft bill criteria to define public benefit or a power for the Home Secretary to set out guidance on how it could be tested.</p> <p>But the idea of criteria has a much greater head of steam behind it in Scotland, which is not covered by the Charity Commission and has set up its own Office of the Scottish Charities Regulator (Oscar).</p> <p>SCVO's submission to the Scottish executive argues that \"only those organisations which have as their overriding purpose and affect the provision of a public benefit should be eligible for Scottish charitable status\". </p> <p>It sets out four criteria: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> that a benefit to the public must be a benefit accessible to the public as a whole, or to disadvantaged sections of the public, or to individuals to develop an exceptional talent which otherwise would be neglected; <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> that the benefit must be a net benefit for the public after any negative points have been taken into account; <br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> that the benefit must be either a direct benefit to the intended beneficiaries or a benefit to organisations which provide a direct benefit; and<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> that the benefit should not be subject to charges or any other condition of access which effectively exclude(s) a significant section of its intended beneficiaries.\"</p> <p>The Scottish executive consultation on its draft bill ends on August 25. Mr Milburn's joint committee will report back to the Westminster parliament on its scrutiny of the English legislation by September 30.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Why credit cards are the only way to pay</strong><br></p> <p>Credit-card companies are not a particularly lovable species, but there is one good reason why you should shack up with one. If you give out your card number to a firm who betrays you, you stand a good chance of getting your money back. A friendly little law called the Consumer Credit Act makes banks and credit-card companies jointly liable if a merchant does a runner or sends you dodgy goods, provided that you paid by credit card and spent more that \u00a3100 on the transaction.</p> <p>Sadly, Sandra Billinge's disabled 92-year-old mother was persuaded to hand over cash for an electronic armchair designed to assist people with mobility problems. She had spotted the chair at a stall run by a Wellingborough-based company called Design &amp; Comfort Ltd at last year's Oxted and Edenbridge agricultural show. The salesman claimed that she would benefit from a special show price if she paid upfront, so she made out a cheque for \u00a31,245 and was promised delivery within six weeks. Twelve months and numerous letters and phone calls later, she has given up on ever receiving her purchase and, because the company has pocketed such a large chunk of her savings, she cannot afford an alternative.</p> <p>Neither the salesman's mobile number nor the number for Design &amp; Comfort's customer services still function, and Northamptonshire Trading Standards says that there has been no sign of the company at its trading address since February. A quick rummage through Companies House records reveals that it has not gone into liquidation, although its accounts are overdue and there is currently a proposal to strike it off. It seems it has simply vanished along with this old lady's savings and possibly those of many more elderly and disabled customers. Enragingly, there is absolutely nothing that can be done to get the money back and, since it is a limited company, the sole director would not have to dig into his personal assets to make good.</p> <p>For what it's worth, he is one Nigel Dawson of The Cottage, School Lane, Maidenhead in Berkshire, although his mobile number is no longer working and he is not listed in the phone directory. If anyone out there knows him, they might like to remind him of at least one frail old lady stuck in an armchair because of his business practices.</p> <p>According to Age Concern, the elderly are particularly vulnerable to hard sales tactics, often by doorstep salesmen offering products to ease mobility problems. The advice comes too late for Billinge's mother, but the rest of us should make sure we are never persuaded to pay upfront for goods that are to be delivered at a later date - except with a credit card.</p> <p><strong>Phone firm goes Awol after overcharging</strong><br></p> <p>Another vanishing act has been performed by the Mobile Republic, which describes itself as one of the UK's top online mobile phone retailers. Andy Graham reckons the company owes him \u00a3500 after he ordered a handset last September. The phone never arrived, but the bills did - \u00a330 a month to service provider Orange for calls he was, of course, unable to make. Five months later a handset did turn up, but it wasn't the one he had ordered and he was told that if he returned it he would receive a full refund within seven days. He did so and received a message informing him that he had returned it outside the cancellation period (because, through no fault of his own, it was five months into his 12-month contract) and that his account would therefore be debited for the full cost of the phone. Worse, he then discovered that when the incorrect handset had been sent out, a second contract had been set up with Orange and he was paying a further \u00a338 a month. Redress was promised and two cheques refunding him the cost of the handset were sent, but both of them bounced and since then he has been unable to get hold of anyone at customer services. </p> <p>Jenny Long also took out a contract with the Mobile Republic last September, lured by the promise of \u00a3100 cashback five months later. She never saw a penny of it, although customer services made encouraging noises every time she called to chase it. </p> <p>Sad to report, the Mobile Republic went into receivership last month, so anyone owed money is unlikely to get it back unless they paid by credit card. Not that they'd be aware of their fate, since, until this week, the website still advertised unmissable deals and the phone lines advised that due to a high volume of calls customers should send an email instead. The official receiver is David Tomlin of Sixth Floor, Sunley House, Bedford Park, Croydon, CR9 1TX, but it's a sorry fact that banks and big business always front the queue of creditors in such cases, and the ordinary punter would be lucky to see a penny of the assets.</p> <p><strong> Open the champers for no-troubles bubbles</strong><br> </p> <p>It's sad to be doom-mongering in this holiday season, so let's end on a cheery note. When Dave Foddy smashed a cherished champagne flute, he was unable to identify the manufacturer, but discovered, via a helpful department store assistant, that it was part of a Portmeirion range. And so he sent an email to the company via its website and was startled to receive a reply within 10 minutes asking him for a photograph of the glass. Within another few minutes, a second email informed him that the snap had been sent off to the factory for identification and an availability check. The following day he received the product code and a mail order telephone number - and two days later, a replacement glass arrived. </p> <p>\"My quest started on the Monday and by the Friday I had my replacement,\" says Foddy. There's a lady called Edna Raftery at Portmeirion who deserves an award of excellence for customer service.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Write to us at 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email us at <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>In stand-up circles, you are known as a deep thinker if you've ever read a book.

  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday August 30 2004</strong> </p> <p> We said in the report below that Microsoft Office 97 was a replacement for Windows 95. We confused two pieces of software: Windows 95 is an operating system; Office 97 is a suite of word processing and other programs. </p> <p></p> <p>Insensitive computer programmers with little knowledge of geography have cost the giant Microsoft company hundreds of millions of dollars in lost business and led hapless company employees to be arrested by offended governments. </p> <p>The problem has damaged the company's reputation and the \"trust rating,\" which is seen as key to keeping the company competitive, has dropped, a senior Microsoft executive revealed yesterday at the International Geographers Conference in Glasgow. </p> <p>In a frank assessment of the company's problems in trying to be a global player without offending local sensibilities, Tom Edwards, its senior geopolitical strategist, said employees' lack of basic geography was to blame. </p> <p>The company has now launched geography classes for its staff to avoid further bloomers which have caused embarrassment and cost money on a grand scale. He said that as a geographer himself it was depressing that Americans had a reputation for being particularly unaware of the rest of the world. The annual National Geographic Survey had thrown up the sad fact that only 23 out of 56 young Americans knew the whereabouts of the Pacific Ocean. </p> <p>\"It is therefore no surprise that some of our employees, however bright they may, have only a hazy idea about the rest of the world,\" he said. \"The repercussions on us can be very serious.\" </p> <p>As an American company with a global reach, Microsoft had to try and foster trust for reliability of its software and not cause offence. </p> <p>He said in all cases the mistakes made were simply through ignorance but this was not how they were seen in the countries concerned. They were all seen as deliberate policy and so the offence taken was far greater as a result. </p> <p>Perhaps the best known, and one of the most expensive, errors was a colour-coded world map showing time zones, which showed the disputed Jammu-Kashmir region as not being in India - an offence under Indian law. The mistake led to the whole of the Windows 95 operating system being banned in the country, losing large sales. For its replacement, Microsoft, Office 97, Microsoft removed the colour coding and sold 100,000 copies in India. </p> <p>Mr Edwards said the decisions on what to do about disputes arising over Microsoft products was taken entirely on commercial grounds. </p> <p>For example when employees were arrested in Turkey because Kurdistan had been shown as a separate entity on maps of the country, a decision was taken to remove Kurdistan from all maps. </p> <p>\"Of course we offended Kurds by doing this but we had offended the Turks more and they were a much more important market for our products. It was a hard commercial decision, not political.\" </p> <p>One mistake that caused catastrophic offence was a game called Kakuto Chojin, a hand to hand fighting game. The fighting went on with rhythmic chanting in the background which in reviewing the game Mr Edwards noticed appeared to be Arabic. </p> <p>\"I checked with an Arabic speaker in the company who was also a Muslim about what the chant meant and it was from the Koran. He went ballistic. It was an incredible insult to Islam.\" He asked for the game to be withdrawn but it was issued against his advice in the United States in the belief that it would not be noticed. </p> <p>Three months later, the Saudi Arabian government made a formal protest. Microsoft withdrew the game worldwide. </p> <p>His investigations showed the Japanese, who had developed the game for Microsoft, had added the chant to the tape because they liked the sound of it without checking its origins. \"They were chastised and corrected,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Edwards said it was better to be honest and open about these mistakes. It was all part of rebuilding that vital trust in the product. </p> <p><strong>Expensive oversights</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A game called Age of Empires 2 offended the Saudi Arabian authorities because it showed victorious Muslim armies turning churches into mosques. The game was withdrawn from sale in the kingdom </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Korean government, objected because Microsoft software showed the national flag in reverse. The software had to be changed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Spanish version of Windows used the word Hembra - meaning \"woman\" in Spain - for choosing gender. But in some Central American republics, notably Nicaragua, the word is an insult meaning \"bitch\". The program was changed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Microsoft employees were questioned by police in China, where it is an offence to refer to Taiwan as a country or as seperate to the Republic of China. Now Taiwan is not referred to as a country and all software worldwide avoids the issue by referring to places as \"regions or districts\". </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Uruguay is a republic and proud if it but in Microsoft's Outlook in Uruguay, the company offended the government by describing Tuesday April 30 as the queen's birthday.</p>",
  "<p>The gap year: a glorious, uninterrupted 365 days for you to do with as you will; a chance to expand your horizons, both mental and physical; an opportunity not to have to sit any blessed exams for once; time for a welcome rest; a breather while you (re)consider your life choices; or just a case of paralysing indecision leading to total inactivity.</p> <p>Whichever way you look at it, a gap year has something to offer pretty much everyone. The only question is: if you take a gap year, what on earth are you going to do with it?</p> <p><strong>Nothing</strong></p> <p>It's always an option: simply take a year off and lie around for the entire time. However, doing nothing is really only a viable option for trainee gurus, who want to spend a year in deep meditation and contemplation, or for the offspring of millionaires whose parents are lenient to the point of insanity. Otherwise, it's a ridiculous plan.</p> <p>You won't have any money, none of your friends will be around, you'll feel as though your life has ground to a halt, and you'll be bored out of your mind. Also, while future employers are fully supportive of a gap year, they would still expect you to do more with your time than just watch Trisha. It's a bad idea. Let's move on.</p> <p><strong>Travel</strong></p> <p>This is more like it. There's many a lonely A-level reviser whose thoughts turn to exotic climes and palm-fringed beaches, and who can blame them? A gap year is the perfect - in fact, possibly the only, ever, in your whole life - chance for an uninterrupted year of travel. And, no, it's not just dossing about somewhere warm.</p> <p>\"Travelling really matures you,\" says Tim Lloyd, who travelled around south-east Asia and Australia in his gap year, before starting his degree in travel management at Brighton University. \"You really have to learn how to deal with people and learn to accept them as they are.\"</p> <p>Lloyd worked at the Royal Mail sorting office in order to finance his trip. \"I resigned myself to not having a life for a few months. I didn't go out, I didn't spend any money, I just worked loads of shifts to save up. I didn't mind because I knew there was such a big life experience at the end of the tunnel.\"</p> <p>One of the main appeals of travelling was the lack of constraints. \"I've always been quite independent,\" he says. \"I didn't want to be tied down to anything. I'd booked my ticket but that was it - and I ended up changing my itinerary a few times, too.\" Which isn't to say travel doesn't have its scary moments.</p> <p>\"I landed in Singapore on my own, age 18, with nowhere to stay. It's quite terrifying thinking back, but you deal with it.\" And, paradoxically, you need to be organised in order to be spontaneous. \"I thoroughly investigated the countries I wanted to go to and had all my jabs. You just have to be clued-up so you can enjoy yourself.\"</p> <p><strong>Work here</strong></p> <p>If, on the other hand, you have no urgent desire to leave the country, why not just get a job? You'll be more flush than you've ever felt before and could save up enough to significantly smooth your transition to student life in a year's time. And it could lead you in undreamt-of directions.</p> <p>That's what happened to Geoffrey Wells, who is studying nursing at Kingston University. \"After my A-levels I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was sick of academic work and I decided to take a gap year. I wasn't even sure that I'd go to college at the end of it. My only motivation at that time was to get some money for a car, and through I neighbour I found out about a job in a care home. I had an informal interview and started working in a day centre for elderly people with dementia or Alzheimer's.\"</p> <p>He found he liked the work. \"It was challenging because most of them were at the stage where they knew something was wrong with them, but couldn't quite work out what.\" Soon, he started considering nursing as a career. \"I decided I wanted a qualification of some sort. My mum's a nurse and she suggested it, as what I was doing was already a form of nursing.\"</p> <p>Wells believes his gap year was valuable. \"It gave me a break and time to think,\" he says. \"If I'd rushed on to college I might have ended up doing something I didn't want to do. I carried on working at the day centre while I was studying, so it's been really useful financially, as well as in terms of experience that I can apply to my nursing.\"</p> <p><strong>Work abroad</strong></p> <p>Finding employment in another country is a good way to travel without parting with too much cash (just don't expect to bring any extra home with you). Because of different visa restrictions around the world, you can't just turn up in the country of your choice and get a job; research is vital. There are also agencies that will help you.</p> <p>Harriet Griffiths has just graduated from Warwick University with a degree in maths. Before she started, she spent a year working in Canada, which she arranged through Bunac. \"I could not have done it without them,\" she says. \"You need a sponsor in order to get a visa, so they do that. They don't find you a job, but they give lots of job-seeking support. And they sort out things like a social security number and a bank account - things you don't really think about before you arrive.\"</p> <p>Because she's a keen skier, Griffiths headed to Banff, in the Rockies, at the start of the ski season. She found work in a hotel. \"Making beds and cleaning toilets wasn't the best job in the world but everyone working in the hotel was there for the same reasons as me, so we had a really good time. The hotel provided cheap accommodation for us, too, so it was a bit like living in student halls, only without the lectures.\"</p> <p>Having to work did not spoil her year out - \"because the rest of the time I was having fun. I was skiing two or three times a week, and it has a real small-town atmosphere, so I could always find someone to go out with. Being in one place for so long meant I got to know it inside out.\"</p> <p>But, she adds, a year out does have some disadvantages. \"You do have to work hard in your first term at college to pick up your subject again and get back into working,\" she says. \"But the benefits far outweigh the problems. I'm more confident in myself. It seems like some people who don't take a gap year go into that machine of school, university, work. I feel like I've seen a bit of the world and it's given me a better outlook on it.\"</p> <p><strong>Volunteer</strong></p> <p>If you're of an altruistic frame of mind, you could consider volunteering, either here or abroad. Charlotte Nock, who is about to start a degree in law with French law at the University of Kent, spent four months in the south Pacific country of Vanuatu - \"50 different islands, near Fiji\" - working in a school, as part of a project organised by GAP.</p> <p>\"It was definitely the place that appealed to me,\" she says. \"It was the other side of the world ... It was different in every way: the people, environment, the landscape. And it was totally idyllic: I lived a few metres away from the bay, and I swam with turtles every day.\" The work was also enjoyable. \"I taught English, French, social science and RE. It was a challenge, especially the RE because it's a country with very strong religious beliefs. I started to really love it. The children responded in a fantastic way and I developed great friendships based round the school.\"</p> <p>Living in a small community with barely any other westerners didn't faze her. \"I totally integrated and I surprised myself by not getting homesick really, apart from a couple of days when I was ill. I do think you need a certain kind of personality to adapt to it. You need to be willing to fit in.\"</p> <p><strong>The unexpected gap year</strong></p> <p>It's all very well if you've been planning your gap year for months, and have read every guide book, scoured every website and digested every scrap of advice you can lay your hands on. But what if your gap year is more thrust upon you than chosen, as a result of disappointing A-level results, perhaps, or a sudden change of heart about your chosen course or college?</p> <p>Remember, you don't have to take a gap year; Clearing is there to smooth your transition into an immediate university career, should you so desire. However, you may decide that some time out is what you need, especially if you're feeling academically shaken.</p> <p>One way to spend your year is to do resits, if you think you need to, or dedicate yourself to reapplying to universities you think will really suit you. On the other hand, perhaps you just want to get the hell out of town. Is it too late? Not remotely.</p> <p>To travel, all you need is a ticket.</p> <p>To work or volunteer abroad, there are literally hundreds of organisations with a myriad options for you to choose from. Don't be rash; give yourself a few months to sort out necessary funds, medical details and insurance and then off you go.</p> <p>See you next year.</p>",
  "<b> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday September 4 2004</b> <br> In section below titled 'Foreign Affairs: The UN's manual labour', we followed conventional wisdom in calling Uluru, previously Ayers Rock, the biggest monolith in the world. The Australian National Museum has now accepted that the largest rocky landform consisting throughout of the same rock type is Mount Augustus (Burringurrah) in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia, about 850km from Perth, and 320km east of Carnarvon (see <a href=\"http://www.amonline.net.au/geoscience/earth/augustus.htm\">amonline.net.au/geoscience/earth/augustus.htm</a>). It is more than twice the volume of Uluru. <br> <p> <b> Filthy lucre</b><br> <b> Where do all the billions go?</b><br> Iris Jeffrey left her winning lottery ticket unchecked in a cupboard for three weeks. She was thinking about throwing it away. Earlier this month, speculation was feverish. Who was the mystery winner of Britain's biggest lottery jackpot? Had they lost their ticket? Would they find it in time? It was really most exciting. Earlier this month, though, Jeffrey finally heard Camelot's appeal, checked her numbers and claimed her \u00a320.1m prize. </p> <p>But what if she hadn't? It turns out that Camelot gives ticket-holders 180 days from the date of the draw (July 14 in Jeffrey's case) to claim their winnings. After that, the lucky lottery firm's staff blow the money on champagne-filled baths and Jaffa Cakes. Not really. Rather, Camelot gives unclaimed winnings, and accumulated interest, to good causes such as arts, sports, heritage and health. </p> <p>Other institutions have less compunction. The Tote, for instance, reportedly \"trousered\" (love that verb) \u00a34m in the last six years in unclaimed winnings (known in the trade as sleepers) - some of them, no doubt, proceeding from that fruity-sounding bet, the each-way yankee. This outrage has prompted the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, to consider putting a clause in this autumn's gambling bill to compel bookies to donate such monies to charities for retired greyhounds, horses, gambling addicts, but not yet, it appears, absent-minded flutterers. Not to be outdone, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, is, according to a recent report, considering legislation that would compel banks to transfer to charity monies from accounts that have been dormant for more than five years, rather than using them to swell their profits even further. </p> <p>The Unclaimed Assets Register reckons that there is \u00a315.3bn in lost or unclaimed assets in Britain. These break down as follows: pensions (\u00a33bn), life policies (\u00a31bn), dormant accounts (\u00a35bn), shares and dividends (\u00a33bn), national savings (\u00a33bn), lottery and other (\u00a3300m). Most likely reasons for people not claiming money rightfully theirs include: failing to tell your spouse you've bought them an asset and then dying, company name changes and, our old friend, forgetfulness. </p> <p>Other unclaimed British assets include more than several unspent gift vouchers, but the UAR doesn't keep figures for them, nor does the chancellor plan to compel the nation to rummage down the back of its collective sofa for unspent tokens and unclaimed Lotto tickets. Just yet. <br><b>Stuart Jeffries</b></p> <p><b> Tricks of the trade</b><br> <b> Homeless security </b><br> In Union Square in Manhattan a man is poking through garbage with a stick. He has a long beard with bits of grass stuck in it but seems relatively together. I ask him if he has seen any agents from the department of homeland security. \"Terrorists give me a headache,\" he says, scratching his neck. </p> <p>According to the New York Post, an elite group of anti- terrorism agents from the department of homeland security has been deployed on the streets of New York in preparation for the Republican convention, which begins on August 30; terrorism is more of a concern in the city now than at any time since 9/11. The agents have apparently been disguised as, among other things, homeless people. The department of defence confirmed the report. The New York City Police Department denied it. </p> <p>It seems to me that if anyone would know it would be other homeless people. Real estate is king in New York, be you tramp or Trump, and homeless people watch their turf. </p> <p>\"Terrorists get inside your head by remote control.\" The man turns and drops his stick. \"Terrorist,\" he says to a young woman in a yellow dress. She looks at him, looks at me, and walks faster. He follows her. \"Terrorist,\" he screams at her, then turns to an elderly gentleman, \"Terrorist.\" I cross the street. \"Hey,\" he calls after me, \"got a cigarette?\" </p> <p>Next to a statue of Gandhi, a bare foot is sticking out from under a pile of grey army blankets. The stench of urine is overwhelming. I look for any sign of covert activity - an antenna or the glint of a lens. Nothing. I move on. </p> <p>I sit down at a picnic table across from a man in a white cowboy hat and explain what I'm doing. Corporations=Death is written in marker pen across his bare chest. The man, who identifies himself as Paul Revere, eyes me over the top of his mirrored sunglasses. \"The pharmaceutical companies killed millions of people in Africa last year by restricting access to Aids drugs,\" he says. \"Compared to that, what's going on in New York is small potatoes.\" </p> <p>He shakes his head. \"They've got you right where they want you. Fear is control. Fear is power.\" </p> <p>Could it be, I ask him, that the department of homeland security and the NYPD issued contradictory statements intentionally? Maybe there are no agents or terrorists and it's just a ploy to keep people from thinking about universal healthcare or the national debt, or Aids in Africa? \"Hey man, relax,\" he says. \"You're starting to sound paranoid.\" <br><b>David Womack</b></p> <p><b> Foreign affairs</b><br> <b> The UN's manual labour</b><br> What's in a name? Confusion, rancour, anxiety - you name it. So many places have changed theirs lately that the UN is to publish two manuals in an effort to standardise them. Peking has become Beijing, Bombay has become Mumbai, and Rhodesia has become Zimbabwe. Cambodia was changed to Kampuchea by the Khmer Rouge in 1976, but changed back in 1989, as if the cartographers weren't busy enough already. </p> <p>The world leader is the Democratic Republic of Congo, the nation formerly known as Zaire, Congo- Kinshasa, Congo-Leopoldville, Belgian Congo and Congo Free State, and not to be confused with the Republic of the Congo, aka Middle Congo and Congo-Brazzaville. </p> <p>It's mostly Europe's fault. The empire-builders did like to change a name. The world's largest monolith was Uluru for millennia, then a white man came along and called it Ayers Rock, after South Australia's then-premier Sir Henry Ayers. </p> <p>Name changes offer miniature replays of colonialism: the locals rise up, the diehards hold out. Mumbai has captured Bombay (latest score on Google: Bombay 1,850,000, Mumbai 2,300,000). Chennai is beating Madras, but Calcutta has yet to fall to Kolkata. And Ayers Rock has held off Uluru. The most successful change is in web-unfriendly China: for every mention of Peking (540,000), there are seven of Beijing (3,820,000). </p> <p>Some changes that look like restorations are not: Bombay originally was Bombay. Sambit Bal, a magazine editor there, says: \"I understand the sentiments behind Mumbai, but it just doesn't feel right. Bombay has a nice cosmopolitan ring to it, Mumbai sounds insular and chauvinistic.\" </p> <p>We can't talk: the United Kingdom is an awful name, a piece of antique spin (1801).

  "Record-breaking A-level results released today have provoked a fresh row about the credibility of the \"gold standard\" exam, with head teachers declaring the 96% pass rate meant the lower grades of D and E had lost their value. <p>Passes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland rose for the 22nd consecutive year, reviving the annual chorus of criticism that the exam is easier and prompting a claim that on current trends the \"no-fail A level\" could be here by the end of the decade. </p> <p>The results of the exams taken by more than 250,000 students show that after years of losing ground to girls, boys have pulled back this year, although their achievement is overshadowed by further falls in the popularity of \"hard\" subjects such as physics, French and German. </p> <p>There was a corresponding increase in the number taking \"softer\" subjects such as psychology and media studies - critics say students are \"working the system\" for the highest possible grades to secure university places. </p> <p>The fact that candidates can re-take one or more of the six A-level modules has added to the criticism, although the exam boards and government ministers insist that standards are being maintained. Only one paper in every 25 is now failed. </p> <p>This year's provisional results show a 0.8 percentage point increase in candidates achieving a grade A (22.4% compared with 21.6% last year), up from less than 10% 20 years ago. </p> <p>The trend has reinforced the critics' question: how can universities and employers choose between candidates clutching strings of straight As. Schools said some students will learn today that they have achieved six straight As. The results are the last before a government-appointed working party announces proposals to replace the 14-19 system of A-levels and GCSEs with a new English diploma. </p> <p>David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said last night that A-levels were going the way of GCSEs, in the sense that universities and employers were increasingly unlikely to look at candidates with less than a C - effectively considered the real pass. </p> <p>\"Ds and Es are a perfectly good recognition of good teaching and hard work,\" he said. \"But I think that, inevitably, we are moving to a situation where As, Bs and Cs are going to be regarded as the benchmark.\" </p> <p>The core subjects English and mathematics are among the three most popular, the rest of the top 10 being a mix of traditional and newer subjects. </p> <p>Computing and IT slumped but law, psychology and media studies continued their rise, particularly among girls. Religious studies showed the biggest leap - 13.8 points - possibly reflecting a growing interest in religions since the September 11 attacks. </p> <p>Teaching unions expressed concern about the continuing fall in the number taking physics and modern languages. </p> <p>Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: \"Over the last five years the number of students taking [physics] at A level has dropped by 5,200. If this rate of decline continues, will physics disappear altogether?\" </p> <p>There was a mixed reaction from employers. Digby Jones, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: \"I am worried that the discussion about grade inflation is taking the education debate in this country on an annual wild goose chase. Grade inflation is an important issue for some universities, but claims that employers are hugely worried are wildly overdone.\" </p> <p>James Walsh, policy adviser to the Institute of Directors, which has been one of the most vocal critics of grade inflation, said: \"With an ever-growing number of A-grade passes being awarded, the brightest students are not shining through.\" </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat education spokesman Phil Willis said: \"Pupils choose subjects where they think they can achieve the best grades, hence the fall in the numbers taking science and mathematics.\" </p> <p>Ellie Johnson Searle, director of the Joint Council, which issued the results, said: \"I think it is a reflection of how well the system works.\" </p> <p>The school standards minister, David Miliband, said: \"We are getting better as a country at getting the best out of our young people. We should applaud them.\" </p> <p><b>Main points</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A-level pass rate up to 96% from 95.4% last year </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Proportion of candidates gaining a grade A up from 21.6% to 22.4% </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Gender gap narrowing slightly, with boys' pass rate up 0.7% and girls' up by 0.4% </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Students turning their backs on computing, modern languages and physics </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Religious studies showing biggest jump in popularity, with law, psychology and media studies also up</p>",
  "<p>Pupils are being warned they risk damaging their career prospects as this year's A-level results show increasing rejection of modern languages and physics in favour of so-called \"soft\" subjects such as psychology and media studies. </p> <p>Headteachers, language teaching bodies and the Institute of Physics said the continuing steep decline in German, French and science subjects would narrow students' job opportunities and earning potential, as well as harming the economy. </p> <p>They warned pupils were choosing A-levels they thought would secure them high grades and university places rather than thinking long term about career options. </p> <p>The \"very worrying\" fall in language learning would also reinforce perceptions of the British as a country with little interest in speaking modern languages, said David Hart, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. </p> <p>Figures published today by the Joint Council for Qualifications show the proportion of students taking German at A-level was down 8.1 percentage points on last year, with just 6,390 candidates taking the exam across Britain, while French was down 2.5 percentage points, with 15,149 candidates. </p> <p>German showed the third biggest fall in any subject, and French the ninth. Science subjects and physics were also on the decline, with physics dropping 6.2 percentage points. </p> <p>The Institute of Physics blamed poor careers advice in schools for the drop-off. Its chief executive, Dr Julia King, said: \"Students who take physics at A-level enjoy higher salaries in later life and have a much wider variety of career options open to them, yet physics is in decline and other subjects, such as media studies and art, are increasingly popular despite the poor career prospects they offer. It's a crazy situation.\" </p> <p>Students needed to \"balance their current interests against their future employment prospects\", she said. </p> <p>The fall-off in physics could make the subject \"the new Latin\", in danger of disappearing altogether, according to Dr Mary Bousted, the general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers. </p> <p>Only computing and information and communications technology A-levels fell faster down the popularity league than sciences and German - a trend interpreted by some as a sign that IT has become such a mainstream skill learned at an early age in school that fewer pupils feel the need to specialise in it after 16. </p> <p>Law, psychology and media studies continued to rise, as did the traditionally demanding subjects maths and further maths.

  "<p>An undercover reporter with a history of violence who worked for the BBC and Channel 4 was yesterday found guilty of torturing a man to death in front of the victim's family. </p> <p>James Raven, 44, worked on more than 50 television programmes including the BBC's MacIntyre Uncovered and Crooked Britain and Channel 4's Sleepers. </p> <p>When they employed Raven, television bosses knew he had served 14 months in jail for a road rage attack. Producers thought he was a changed man whose background had made him ideal for investigating crime gangs. </p> <p>But Raven, who has an array of tattoos including \"approach with extreme caution\" and \"psychopath\", was not a reformed character. </p> <p>Chester crown court heard how he subjected Brian Waters to \"systematic and barbaric torture\" at a farm in Tabley, Cheshire, in June last year. </p> <p>The farm's cowshed was \"turned into a torture chamber\" during the killing which was linked to a dispute over drugs. </p> <p>With his adult son and daughter tied up and forced to watch, Waters was beaten, whipped, burned and attacked with an industrial staple gun by a gang believed to have been led by Raven.</p> <p>Waters was hung upside down and his attackers tried to sexually assault him with an iron bar, causing fatal internal injuries. The savage attack left him with 123 different injuries including 24 individual rib fractures. </p> <p>The court heard that the man was killed in a revenge attack ordered by Raven's co-defendant, John Wilson, 55, allegedly after falling out about a large debt with Waters, who had convictions for drug dealing, and had a cannabis farm. </p> <p>As well as Waters being killed, 21-year-old Suleman Razak, a stepson of one of Waters' business partners, was also assaulted. </p> <p>Raven had denied murder, saying he had gone along with a scheme to steal equipment from the cannabis farm while working for an undercover TV programme. He said it was called Reefer Madness, which was looking into drug dealing and the reclassification of cannabis. </p> <p>He said he witnessed the attacks but had nothing to do with them. \"I was horrified,\" said Raven. \"I tried to get them to stop but they ignored me.\" </p> <p>But after 16 hours of deliberation a jury found Raven, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, and Wilson, of Glossop, Derbyshire, both guilty of murder and two counts of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. </p> <p>\"Raven was plainly the ringleader,\" Patrick Harrington QC, prosecuting, told the court. \"Brian Waters was the victim of systematic and barbaric torture. The injuries and the manner of their infliction is, to say the least, chilling.\" </p> <p>Ashley Guishard, 30, of Sale, Greater Manchester, was cleared of all charges. </p> <p>The jury was sent home for the night after failing to reach a verdict on Otis Matthews, 27, of Manchester, who is charged with the same offences. </p> <p>During the eight-week trial it emerged that Raven and his cousin Christopher More, 26, who is still wanted by police in connection with Waters' death, earned up to \u00a3500 a day working on undercover assignments for the BBC and Channel 4. </p> <p>Raven ran a bed linen company before he found greater rewards working in television. </p> <p>The court heard that a surveillance company run by Raven and Mr More earned \u00a380,000 a year. Raven drove an expensive soft-top Mercedes with personalised plates; Mr More had a Porsche and would boast of his undercover work to impress women, the court heard. </p> <p>In a statement last night, the BBC said: \"From time to time in cases of overriding public interest, the BBC, like other media organisations, works with people who have had criminal convictions in order to expose criminality or serious wrongdoing. At the time of these offences James Raven was no longer working for the BBC.\" </p> <p>The court heard how the killers had broken into the farmhouse and destroyed the cannabis farm. </p> <p>They attacked Mr Razak and hung him from his ankles with his face and head submerged in a barrel of water. He was burned with chemicals, and a pillowcase covering his head was set on fire. </p> <p>Waters arrived later at the farm and was also suspended upside down and used as a \"human punchbag\", the court heard. A bin bag was set alight and the molten plastic was allowed to drip on to him. </p> <p>When Waters' son and daughter arrived at the farm they were abducted at gunpoint and tied up. Waters' wife, Julie, was also abducted from the family home in nearby Nantwich, Cheshire, and taken prisoner. </p> <p>She was driven in the family car to the scene of the attack and found her murdered husband. </p> <p>During the trial, several television executives for BBC and Channel 4 went into the witness box to admit they had employed Raven. </p> <p>Gregor Stewart, a radio and television producer for the BBC and companies supplying Channel 4, said he met Raven in autumn 2002 when he was researching a film about cannabis. </p> <p>\"James Raven fitted in very well with other criminals. He was described to me as looking particularly aggressive, but I find his appearance to be deceptive. I knew that he had a conviction in the past but I understood him to be a reformed man.\" </p> <p>Fiona Campbell, commissioning editor for Channel 4 and a former BBC series producer, employed the pair to work on investigations about car crime and the illegal meat trade. </p> <p>\"I was aware that [Raven] had convictions for violence,\" she told the court, adding that he was \"organised ... reliable\" and a good employee. </p> <p>Freelance producer and director Tom Anstis, who has worked for the BBC and Channel 4, told the court that there was a lengthy process before he was hired. </p> <p>He said: \"I knew that he had previous convictions. I had no idea that there was so many ... I have not seen him use or offer violence to anyone.\"</p>",
  "<p>The BBC's position as the dominant force in British television production is likely to be diluted as a result of pressure on it to take a scythe to its sprawling structure. </p> <p>The BBC is by far the biggest programme-maker in Britain, employing almost 20,000 people in production-related jobs. Critics say it is too big. </p> <p>Independent producers have long believed the size of the BBC's production division puts them at a disadvantage because commissioning executives are under pressure to keep in-house staff occupied, despite a legal obligation on the corporation to source a certain number of shows from outside. </p> <p>Relations between the BBC and the \"indies\", as they are known, deteriorated under the previous director-general, Greg Dyke, who said it was not his job to make them rich. Mr Dyke was derisive of the demands of independent producers, some of whom - including ex-BBC staff such as Big Brother guru Peter Bazalgette - became millionaires when selling their companies on. </p> <p>Independent productions for the BBC include: Spooks (Kudos); Have I Got News for You (Hat Trick); Friday Night with Jonathan Ross (Open Mike); and Restoration and Fame Academy (Endemol). </p> <p>Fences have been mended between the corporation and the indies with a deal on new terms of trade, and the indies are now arguing for the BBC to spend much more externally, commissioning shows on merit , not through the need to keep BBC employees in jobs. </p> <p>At the moment, the BBC is obliged to commission 25% of its programmes from outside, although certain genres, such as news, are exempt. The BBC said last week it had commissioned more than 2,300 hours from independents in 2003-04. </p> <p>Jana Bennett, the BBC's director of television, said: \"I am committed to staying well above the quota in this current year and in the years to come.\" </p> <p>Pact, the trade body for more than 600 indies, wants the BBC's in-house productions limited to 50% of output, with 25% reserved for indies and the rest open to all. This would favour producers outside the BBC who do not qualify in law as indies, such as Granada, the programme-making arm of ITV. Pact also wants the quotas measured by programme cost, as well as length. </p> <p>Such a shift in power would inevitably lead to significant job losses at the BBC, although many of these people would probably set up their stall in the expanding indie sector. There are fears in the BBC of a bloodbath; independent producers say it would be more akin to a blood transfusion. </p> <p>It appears the indies are knocking at an open door: one of the first acts of Mark Thompson when he took up his post as director general in June was to commission a review of the BBC's commissioning and production structure. Although he was at pains to say he had an \"open mind\", few believe he would have ordered the review had he believed the system was sound. </p> <p>Mr Thompson hinted in a speech on his first day that the coming months would bring significant changes to the BBC's structure. \"A BBC which is big in terms of services is essential. But how deep should the BBC be? How big, in other words, in terms of vertical integration, of departments, in-house operations and commercial subsidiaries? ... We face a much tougher financial environment going forward - and some testing questions about our size and shape as an organisation.\" </p> <p>John McVay, the chief executive of Pact, said he is arguing for a \"level playing field\" and for programmes to be commissioned on merit, regardless of who made them. \"The only way the BBC is going to survive in future is by making the best programmes,\" he said. </p> <p>The BBC's review is likely to be completed this autumn, before the green paper on the renewal of its royal charter.</p>",
  "<p>The most high-profile media transaction this year, the sale of the Telegraph Group, attracted considerable interest from private equity groups. The disposal of BBC Worldwide, if it goes ahead, is also expected to be keenly contested by buyout firms.</p> <p>The BBC's commercial arm carries all the attributes of a private equity target: access to a strong portfolio of brands and strong cash flows (\u00a3141m last year). </p> <p>Executives at leading private equity houses are talking openly about bidding for the business that boasts brands including Top Gear magazine, the Radio Times and the BBC America channel. Advent International, a firm that has been active in European radio recently, believes the BBC would be able to pull off a quicker and easier sale with private equity buyers. </p> <p>Tim Franks, an Advent executive, says intellectual property (IP) deals, whereby the BBC licenses the Radio Times or Top Gear brand to another company, would be easier to strike with buyout firms. </p> <p>\"The BBC will want to hold a lot of the IP rights to these brands and it will not want these brands to be tainted. If they can come up with some licensing agreements they get a continued revenue stream, even if they have spun out the distribution arm. </p> <p>\"That might be easier to do with a non-strategic player, like a private equity company, than a media company.\" </p> <p>Nick Martin, head of the media team at private equity firm HgCapital, says the Worldwide operation \"could be worth nothing or it could be worth \u00a31bn\". As with Advent, the main issue is intellectual property, and how much control the buyer has over brands such as Teletubbies and Top of the Pops. The unit generated \u00a3141m last year. But can it throw off as much cash from arm's length licensing and service agreements with the BBC?</p> <p>\"Intellectual property ownership is like property ownership. Is it a one-year lease or the freehold? Is it for one year or perpetuity, for all territories or just greater London? Is it all media or just printed magazines? The closer the BBC makes it to a freehold, the more valuable it is. </p> <p>\"There is nothing in the market at the moment that suggests where the BBC might want to pitch that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Great Britain's three-day eventing team have joined forces with their French and American counterparts to challenge the gold medal claims of Germany and Bettina Hoy.</p> <p>The challenge comes after chaotic scenes at the Markopoulo Equestrian Centre last night, when Hoy initially lost her title only to have it reinstated after officials looked into an allegation that, against event rules, she had circled the start area twice. </p> <p>Silver medallist Leslie Law stands to claim Britain's first gold of the Games should the joint action be successful, with Pippa Funnell moving into the bronze medal position. </p> <p>The British team would also have their team bronze upgraded to silver.</p> <p>The British chef de mission, Simon Clegg, met his French and US counterparts to discuss the matter this morning. They have already notified the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) of their desire to challenge the outcome of last night's competition. </p> <p>\"In the interests of the athletes, fair play and the integrity of sport, all parties have agreed to jointly pursue all available avenues of appeal and, if necessary, to take this matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,\" said a joint statement. </p> <p>The three nations expect to lodge their case in the coming days, by which time the British team will have returned home. </p> <p>In the aftermath of Hoy's eventual victory, Law was critical of the judging, saying: \"Some of the officials should be answerable. It is a farce the way things have happened.\" </p> <p>Rules state that riders are allowed 45 seconds after the bell rings to start their round but during that period Hoy went across the start line but did not start her round in the second of three show-jumping phases yesterday, instead making a circle. </p> <p>The judge had already started the clock, however, and counted the 14 seconds from when she made her circle toward the start line, efore putting the clock to zero again when she crossed the start a second time. </p> <p>The British camp clearly believe the decision was incorrect and, unless they get the final verdict overturned, will seek recourse through AS, the final appeal body for any sporting dispute. </p> <p>Ironically, a Briton, Hugh Thomas, was on the appeal committee which eventually handed Hoy her medal last night. \"We looked into the situation, and we all agreed that the incident was primarily caused by an error in the management of the competition,\" he said. </p> <p>\"When errors occur in the management of a competition, it is right to make sure that the rider does not pay the consequences. </p> <p>\"Bettina Hoy had every right to believe that the time started only when she crossed the start line the second time.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain's three-day eventers will this morning petition the Court of Arbitration for Sport in an attempt to get the individual silver and team bronze medals they won yesterday upgraded to gold and silver. </p> <p>The final day of eventing turned to rancorous farce last night after Leslie Law had added silver to the team's bronze. Earlier the British team - comprising Law, Pippa Funnell, Jeanette Brakewell and Mary King - having looked to have bagged bronze, found themselves upgraded to silver when the winning German team were penalised for Bettina Hoy crossing the start line twice. They then reverted to bronze after a successful German appeal. </p> <p>But the three countries affected - Britain, the US and France - will today take their case to have the German appeal overturned to the CAS, which is sitting in a special session in Athens during the games. If successful, Law will find himself promoted to the gold medal position and the team to silver. </p> <p>Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson, meanwhile, have guaranteed themselves at least a silver in the badminton mixed doubles by qualifying for the final, where they will meet a Chinese pairing, Jun Zhang and Gao Ling, this afternoon. </p> <p>At the Panathinaiko stadium the archer Alison Williamson, competing in her fourth Olympics, won a bronze medal after Yuan Su Chi could make only a seven with her final arrow when a nine would have landed her the medal. </p> <p>Earlier Williamson's quarter-final opponent from China had twice recorded zeroes after she shot out of turn and was then timed out as her coach argued with the referee. </p> <p>At the canoeing lake Helena Reeves was also the recipient of an unexpected medal in the K2 kayak when the French woman Peggy Dickens was retrospectively penalised two seconds, sufficient to lift the Nottingham-based paddler into the medals. \"It's pretty fantastic,\" she said. </p> <p>The four successes lifted Great Britain to 24th in the medal table.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Highlights of the day</strong> </p> <p><strong> Helen Reeves </strong> got the day off to a superb start for Team GB by winning bronze in the K1 canoeing final. The 23-year-old had originally been placed fourth in the final standings but a two-second penalty for third-placed Frenchwoman Peggy Dickens - announced after the initial results came out - saw the pair swap places. </p> <p><strong> Alison Williamson </strong> won archery bronze with a last-gasp win over Chinese Taipei's Shun Chi Yuan. The 32-year-old primary school teacher was tied with her play-off opponent at 97-97 with one arrow left. Williamson, at her fourth Olympics, scored an eight, while Yuan could only score a seven. </p> <p><strong> Leslie Law</strong> added individual silver to team bronze as Great Britain's <strong> three-day eventers </strong> weighed in with two medals on a dramatic night at the Markopoulo Equestrian Centre. Law's clear round briefly put him in the gold-medal position but he was overhauled by the British-based German Bettina Hoy. </p> <p>The <strong> men's coxless four </strong> crew of James Cracknell, Matthew Pinsent, Steve Williams and Ed Coode booked their place in Saturday's final, as did the <strong> women's pair </strong> of Katherine Grainger and Cath Bishop. <strong> Women's double sculls </strong> duo Elise Laverick and Sarah Winckless also progressed to the final with an impressive win in the repechage. </p> <p> <strong> Lowlights</strong> </p> <p> Judo player <strong> Kate Howey</strong>'s second-round loss brought the final curtain down on an Olympic career which spanned four games. <strong> Winston Gordon</strong>'s promising run ended in disappointment when he lost to eventual champion Zurab Zviadauri of Georgia and then was beaten in the bronze-medal play-off by Dutchman Mark Huizinga. </p> <p> <strong> Quote of the day</strong> </p> <p> \"Oh my goodness, I am sitting next door to Roger Federer and it's like I am in love\" - New Zealand eventing rider Heelan Tompkins takes a little time to realise she is sitting next to the Wimbledon champion at the Olympic village restaurant. </p> <p> <strong> Medal table</strong> G S B </p> <p><strong> 1 China </strong> 10 7 4 </p> <p><strong> 2 United States</strong> 9 10 9 </p> <p><strong> 3 Japan </strong> 8 3 2 </p> <p><strong> 4 Australia </strong> 6 4 6 </p> <p><strong> 5 Ukraine </strong> 5 1 1 </p> <p><strong> 6 Russia </strong> 3 6 6 </p> <p><strong> 7 Italy </strong> 3 4 2 </p> <p><strong> 8 France </strong> 3 3 4 </p> <p><strong> 9 Germany </strong> 3 2 5 </p> <p><strong> 10 South Korea</strong> 2 4 2 </p> <p><strong> 24 Great Britain</strong> 0 2 4</p>",
  "<p>On a final day of extraordinary drama, spiced with a huge pinch of controversy, Britain's Leslie Law, riding Shear L'Eau, won the individual silver medal at the Olympic three-day event, where the team collected bronze. If this in some way sounds straightforward, then in reality nothing could have been more complicated. But great was the British joy - and great the disappointment too. </p> <p>To begin at somewhere close to the end: just as the British eventers were hugging themselves at snaffling the bronze team medal from the United States in the showjumping ring, the startling news came that the bronze had controversially been transformed into silver. </p> <p>Germany's Bettina Hoy, who later won the individual gold, had apparently crossed the showjumping start line twice and thereby incurred an extra 14 penalty time points. This appeared not only to have deprived the Germans of the gold but, much worse, left them with no medal at all, ruining Hoy's individual chances in the process. Everybody else was bumped up one place with France, the overnight leaders, provisionally taking the gold, Britain the silver and the US the bronze. </p> <p>And so matters stood for about an hour. To say that pandemonium broke out would be a huge understatement. Only the horses remained calm. Protest and counter-protest occurred, with the Germans crying foul and furiously questioning the rules. Those with years of three-day eventing experience were not afraid to admit their uncertainty as to any definitive outcome. </p> <p>Germany's protest was still unresolved when the top 25 riders began their quest for the individual medals. Then the appeal committee announced that Hoy had suffered a \"clear\" injustice, removed the time penalties and once again the team gold belonged to Germany, France had the silver and Britain the bronze. Later Britain, France and the US decided to take the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, where it will be heard today. </p> <p>Initially Pippa Funnell, whose meticulous clear round on Primmore's Pride had set up Britain's late challenge, had hailed the winning of the bronze as a \"gold medal performance\". Her clear round had placed huge pressure on the last American, Kimberly Severson on Winsome Adante, who appeared to have done everything right only to be a little too cautious at the last and 13th jump. Her horse flicked the fence with its back legs and the bronze belonged to Britain. Then, wonder of wonders, it became a silver. But it was fool's silver, or so it appears. \"Up until yesterday we couldn't believe all our bad luck. It felt as if we were cursed because we had not left a stone unturned in our preparation for the games,\" said Funnell, who by the end of the evening did not know whether to laugh or cry. </p> <p>All the team, and Funnell in particular, had been feeling desperately low on Tuesday night after the cross-country. She had incurred too many time faults, thereby all but ruining her own chances of an individual gold and setting the team back in the process. She hid it well but the disappointment had been intense. Had Hoy not had her penalty points rescinded, Funnell might have had an individual bronze and Law the gold. </p> <p>Britain had begun the day in fourth place, having lost their leading rider William Fox-Pitt in fifth, whose horse Tamarillo had been withdrawn after the cross-country. And even that was not straightforward, for Fox-Pitt had apparently had a perfect ride and could not remember hitting any fence. The injury was as baffling as much else was yesterday. </p> <p>\"It had been a real rollercoaster of a week and we were all devastated for Pippa on Tuesday night,\" said Fox-Pitt. \"To drop down to fourth after my horse was hurt made us even more despondent but what the team did this afternoon made me very proud. It was just amazing to have a bronze medal and I could not be happier for Leslie. Fantastic.\" </p> <p>Law, who had ridden a superb clear round on Shear L'Eau, giving inspiration and confidence to Funnell to emulate him in the team showjumping, admitted that it had been much more nerve-racking than in Sydney four years ago when Britain won the team silver. \"On that occasion we were secure in second place and we probably should have won the gold. This was completely different but both Pippa and I learned a lot from last time.\" </p> <p>He began the jump-off for the individual medals in fifth place and then sat back and watched as three of the next four riders, including Funnell who had been in fourth, clattered the fences. The most spectacular loser was France's Nicolas Touzaint who had been in the gold medal position, jumped last and finished ninth. </p> <p>\"This was the best I have ever ridden and it is fantastic to have won a silver but it was a bitter pill not to get the team silver as well,\" said Law. Had Fox-Pitt's horse not gone lame it might just have been a double gold, although at the start of the day everybody would have settled for a single bronze.</p>",

  "<p>Inspired by the magnificent surroundings of the Panathinaiko stadium and assisted by a gust of wind and a police siren, the British archer Alison Williamson ended her 12-year quest for an Olympic medal at the fourth attempt when she won bronze in the women's individual competition. </p> <p>Williamson last night won the third-place play-off against Yuan Su Chi of Chinese Taipei with a 12-arrow score of 105, one better than her opponent, who needed only an eight - a bullseye scores 10 - to take the match into a shoot-out, or a nine to join the Korean finalists on the podium. </p> <p>With the scores level as the pair shot their final arrows Williamson could manage only an eight, a mediocre score in a Olympic final and one that her opponent seemed certain to at least match. \"I thought it had gone,\" she said. \"I didn't want to watch as she took her shot but I couldn't not.\" </p> <p>What she saw when she eventually looked up will remain with her for years to come. As Yuan raised her bow and prepared to release the arrow a police siren on the street that runs past the stadium disturbed her concentration, and she paused, running down the clock before taking aim once more. </p> <p>This time, as the arrow set out on its 70-metre journey towards the 12cm bullseye that would have secured a medal, a capricious gust got up, and when the arrow thudded into the target it registered only a seven. </p> <p>As the score flashed up Williamson could barely believe her luck, pausing before leaping into the arms of her coach, the Ukrainian Sergei Rodinov. \"I'm so happy. It was tense at the end, a real nailbiter, and when her last arrow landed I thought it was a good score. I couldn't believe she only got a seven. It's just a fantastic feeling.\" </p> <p>Williamson's medal behind the Korean pair, Park Sung Hyun and Lee Sung Jin, was just reward for one of Britain's most committed Olympians. She competed in her first games in Barcelona in 1992 and travelled to Sydney four years ago as a fancied medal chance. She was knocked out in the last 16, however, by the formidable Yun Mi-Jin, who at 17 managed a world record 11 bulls in 18 arrows. Until yesterday she thought her chance had gone. </p> <p>However, she secured Britain's first medal in the women's event since Sybil Newall, aged 53, won gold in 1908. </p> <p>Acquiring the skill, nerve and concentration to fire arrows at an area the size of a saucer positioned almost the length of a football pitch away requires huge commitment, and Williamson had been shooting for 30 hours a week in the build-up to Athens. </p> <p>Last year she qualified for lottery funding for the first time, allowing her to concentrate on the sport to which she was introduced by her parents Sue and Tom, both recreational archers, while working part-time teaching seven to 11-year-olds near her home. </p> <p>As well as the hours spent wearing out the bullseye on the targets at Church Stretton archery club in Shropshire, she has jogged, lifted weights and worked with a sports psychologist in the past year to give herself the best chance of a medal in Athens. </p> <p>Perhaps the decisive factor, however, was her alliance with Rodinov, the Ukrainian charged with bringing through a new generation of archers, including Naomi Folkard, 21, who was eliminated in the quarter-final. </p> <p>Williamson's quarter-final was controversial, with her Chinese opponent He Ying scoring two zeroes after she shot out of turn and was then timed out on her next shot while her coach argued with the referee. </p> <p>Williamson kept her composure but there was little she could do to stop the eventual champion Park in the semi-final. The Korean managed to hit a tiny television camera in the centre of the target during her 110, the second highest score of the competition and a 12-arrow sequence that included four maximums. </p> <p>Appropriately enough for the 1992 Moet &amp; Chandon young sportswoman of the year, Williamson said she would celebrate with a bottle of champagne, and described the medal as \"a present to my mum and dad and all the people who have stuck by me through the years\". </p> <p>It was the stadium, however, that got the final tribute: \"It's just amazing to be here, to think that De Coubertin sat here all those years ago. To win [a medal] here where it all started is simply wonderful.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bradford Bulls have drawn first blood in the build-up to Sunday's Super League derby at Leeds, forcing the Rhinos chief executive Gary Hetherington to apologise for comments he made earlier in the summer when the fierce Yorkshire rivals were battling to sign Iestyn Harris. </p> <p>The Bulls took the unusual step of contacting a news agency yesterday to release details of Hetherington's apology, adding further spice to a match in which Harris will return to Headingley for the first time since he left Leeds for Welsh rugby union three years ago. </p> <p>On the day Bradford paraded Harris at Odsal last month, Leeds issued a press release in which Hetherington accused them of coercing the stand-off to break an agreement to rejoin the Rhinos. </p> <p>Actually, because of a spelling mistake on the release, the accusation was that Harris had been \"cohearsed\". That at least was rectified in Hetherington's retraction, which will have given particular pleasure to Bradford's chairman Chris Caisley, a specialist in contract law. </p> <p>Caisley passed on the details of Hetherington's apology thus: \"By publications made by me personally as chief executive of Leeds Rugby Ltd, trading as Leeds Rhinos, I alleged that you had coerced Mr Iestyn Harris to enter into a contract with you. </p> <p>\"Leeds Rugby Ltd and I recognise that there was no foundation to this allegation and regret that it was ever made. </p> <p>\"We are happy to take the earliest opportunity for correcting our error and of expressing to you our regret for any distress or embarrassment caused to you by the publication of this allegation.\" </p> <p>If Harris can run rings as comprehensively around the Leeds players this weekend, the Super League leaders -who have already beaten Bradford twice this season - could be in trouble. </p> <p>However Headingley will be a lonely and hostile place on Sunday night for a player who used to be idolised by the Leeds zealots in the South Stand. The ground's 21,000 capacity is expected to be tested, but Bradford have returned more than half of their allocation of 2,000 tickets. </p> <p>Meanwhile Liam Botham has succeeded in his aim of earning a professional contract in a third sport, with Leeds yesterday confirming that they have agreed a one-year deal with the 26-year-old who has previously played cricket for Hampshire and rugby union with Cardiff and Newcastle. </p> <p>Botham joined Leeds on a cross-code contract last summer but mainly to play rugby union for the Tykes. However the former England A union wing has impressed the Rhinos coach Tony Smith in his attempts to convert himself into a league second-row, not least in two months on loan with the London Broncos when he capped a solid display against Leeds at Griffin Park by kicking a late conversion to snatch a 36-all draw. </p> <p>\"He has earned and deserves his new contract and he knows he is still developing as a player,\" said Smith. \"His spell at London was extremely important for him. Liam is one of the hardest working players I have ever come across.\" </p> <p>Salford are to sign David Hodgson, a 23-year-old three-quarter who played for Great Britain two years ago but who will be released by Wigan at the end of the season.</p>",
  "<p>Darren Campbell, the British sprinter many believe was cheated out of the Olympic 200 metres gold medal four years ago, has said he cannot afford to be bitter about being beaten by Kostas Kederis then. </p> <p>The Greek, who withdrew from the games yesterday before the International Olympic Committee expelled him, burst from anonymity to win in Sydney. </p> <p>\"I don't look back at Sydney,\" said Campbell last night. \"I can't bring back that moment, so I don't think about it. It's too far in the past. I know a lot of people will wonder how I can say that but it's just the way it is.\" </p> <p>Earlier in the year, after Kederis was linked to the FBI investigation into the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative in San Francisco, Campbell claimed it had long been suspected his rival had been using drugs. Kederis denied yesterday having ever taken anything illegal. </p> <p>But there are plenty in the sport who believe that Campbell can claim morally to be the 2000 Olympic champion, a situation that will have been strengthened by recent events. </p> <p>\"I can't comment,\" he said. \"It's for other people to comment. If you want to say that - great. Darren Campbell is a simple guy. He goes out and gives it his best shot and whatever he gets, he gets.\" </p> <p>Kederis and Ekaterini Thanou, the Sydney Olympic 100m silver medallist who has also withdrawn from the games, are now set to be the subject of an investigation by the International Association of Athletics Federations into their pattern of unavailability for drugs tests. </p> <p>\"If you look at it objectively, the positive is that the authorities seem to be catching up with people doing naughty things,\" said Campbell. </p> <p>\"You could say it doesn't do the sport a lot of good but the more people we catch, the cleaner the games will be. </p> <p>\"So, if we want a clean event, no one should complain when athletes get caught or when times aren't as fast as they have been in the past. If we are clean, times will be slower and people have to accept it.\" </p> <p>After Campbell had won his medal in Sydney he was quizzed about the fact that his coach Linford Christie had tested positive for drugs. </p> <p>Christos Tzekos, Kederis's coach, had applauded loudly from the back of the room then, when Campbell said too much attention was being paid to the subject. </p> <p>Tzekos is now facing a life ban from the sport if he is found guilty by the IAAF of being involved in a conspiracy of having helped his athletes avoid being drug tested. </p> <p>Tzekos was cautioned last April after relocating Kederis and Thanou, without informing the IAAF or the Greek athletic federation. Kederis, Thanou and Tzekos were pictured in a local newspaper in Qatar during the Iraq war after declaring they would be training on the Greek island of Crete. </p> <p>The episode prompted the IAAF to send a letter to the Greeks warning that they needed to cooperate \"in order to avoid an unnecessary embarrassment before the Olympic Games\". </p> <p>In 1997 the IAAF had banned Tzekos for two years after he manhandled a drugs control officer at a training camp in Dortmund while three of his athletes fled and escaped a random test. </p> <p>Upon his return from his IAAF ban in 1999 Tzekos started coaching Kederis and within a year had converted him from a failed 400 metres runner into the Olympic 200m champion. In 2001 Kederis won the world title in Edmonton and a year later the European Championship. </p> <p>The IOC will be closely scrutinising the IAAF investigation to ensure that it is carried out thoroughly. Privately, Olympic officials are furious that this affair has been allowed to overshadow the start of the games. </p> <p>They believe the situation could have been sorted out much earlier if the world governing body had taken the problem more seriously. </p> <p>Istvan Gyulai, the general secretary of the IAAF, had said at a meeting last November it was time the world governing body tried to prosecute coaches, agents and managers. </p> <p>But some in the IOC are suspicious that, while Tzekos may long have been culpable of helping Kederis and Thanou engage in suspect methods, the IAAF has not tried to test his athletes as often as it should have. </p> <p>\"I can't get caught up in thinking like that,\" said Campbell. </p> <p>Kederis's removal from the Olympics has greatly boosted Campbell's chances of success in the 100m and 200m here. </p> <p>The Manchester runner, 30, has arrived here in a similar situation to Sydney with few people giving him much possibility of a medal after a disappointing build-up. </p> <p>\"These are exciting times,\" said Campbell, whose campaign starts on Saturday when he runs in the opening round of the 100m. \"I'm not being given a chance which is how I like it. But my training in Cyprus went very well. I believe exciting things are going to happen here. </p> <p>\"This is the first time this year I've felt good. It's a different Darren Campbell to the one you saw in Britain. </p> <p>\"I can't think too far ahead. I believe I have one chance and this is it. I will focus on the 100m and then concentrate on the 200m and 4x100m relay. I think we will do better than people think.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mephisto, who was a 14-1 chance when the books opened on the Totesport Ebor several weeks ago, landed a sustained ante-post gamble in Europe's most valuable handicap on the Knavesmire yesterday. For the punters who backed him down to a starting price of 6-1, however, the experience was as much of a trial as it was a triumph. </p> <p>Mephisto beat Gold Ring by a short-head after a thrilling struggle through the final furlong which saw the lead change three times in the final dozen strides. </p> <p>However, Mephisto had veered across the track towards the runner-up as the post arrived and given his opponent a minor but definite bump. It was only after an inquiry lasting almost 20 minutes that the stewards confirmed the result and the celebrations could finally begin. </p> <p>The confidence that had propelled Mephisto towards the head of the market in recent weeks had diminished somewhat by the time of the race, as persistent rain reduced the turf to a sticky sludge far softer than anything he had previously encountered. </p> <p>However, Darryll Holland rode a confident race on Luca Cumani's five-year-old, sitting well off the steady pace set by Royal Cavalier, before delivering the winning run down the wide outside. </p> <p>Gold Ring, who struck for home three furlongs out, had already seen off challenges from Self Defense, Defining and Fantastic Love, but though he hauled himself back into the lead after being headed 50 yards out, Mephisto had the strength and determination to seize the initiative one final time. </p> <p>\"It was difficult because he was out in the centre on his own and he has never run on that ground before,\" Holland said. \"I did all I could to keep him straight, but it wasn't enough. I took it off [Gold Ring], then he got back in front again, but I got him right on the line.\" </p> <p>The rain washed away the most interesting runner in the Group One Yorkshire Oaks, when Ouija Board, the winner of both the English and Irish Oaks, was withdrawn by Ed Dunlop as the ground continued to deteriorate. In her absence, though, the crowd still enjoyed an impressive winning performance, as Quiff, trained by Sir Michael Stoute, galloped away from the field in the straight to win by 11 lengths. Punctilious, the 6-4 favourite, could finish only fourth for Godolphin and Frankie Dettori. \"We thought she'd win, but we didn't know she'd win by that far,\" Stoute said. \"She's a very progressive filly and she likes a bit of give. She's in the St Leger, so we'll have to think about that route.\" </p> <p>Quiff is 4-1 second-favourite (from 25-1) with Hill's for the St Leger, behind Rule Of Law, who is 100-30 (from 3-1). </p> <p>Tony James, who beat Andronikos and Abraxas Antelope to win the Gimcrack Stakes for Clive Brittain, is a 50-1 chance with the same firm for next year's 2,000 Guineas.</p>",
  "<p>Tiger Woods arrived yesterday occupying a position unique in his professional career. The world No1, just, has not won a single strokeplay event this season, a damning statistic when measured against his previous achievements. </p> <p>The $7m (\u00a33.89m) NEC Invitational, a world championship event starting today, represents his next to last chance of making something of his season, with only the American Express Championship at Mount Juliet at the end of September remaining as a significant strokeplay tournament for him. </p> <p>Combined with the fact that he has not now won a major championship for more than two years, the word slump can safely be applied to his recent form and this week Sports Illustrated even posed the question: \"End of an Era? Woods' best days may be behind him.\" </p> <p> For a 28-year-old who this season has played 14 strokeplay events, finished in the top 10 nine times and been third three times, winning $3,569,972, that question may be a little premature. But there is no doubt that the best days were considerably better than these. </p> <p>In his first full year on the US tour, 1997, Woods won four times, in his third and fourth years eight and nine times respectively and every year since five times. He is unlikely to play sufficient tournaments this year to match those standards and, even if he did, he is not playing well enough to win consistently. </p> <p>Last week, at the PGA Championship, Woods was asked if his confidence level was lower now than it had been in 2000, the year he won three majors. \"Sure,\" said Woods, \"I haven't been hitting the ball as close to the flag and consequently not making so many putts. </p> <p>\"But you keep playing because everyone of us has doubts and we have to overcome them. That's part of the game, that's part of the sport.\" </p> <p>As a confession it was revealing. Up until this year Woods had given the impression that a single doubt has never crossed his mind and, furthermore, would never be allowed to. </p> <p>The difference, though, between the winning Woods and the current version is that he always previously had a coach with whom he could confer. Even if that coach acted only as a mirror, he could offer confirmation that Woods was doing the right things, and at least suggest possible remedies if things were going not so well. </p> <p>Now Woods seems determined to do it all on his own, to be in total control of his own destiny in a game where most players need all the help they can get. This year he has finished tied 22nd in the Masters, tied 17th in the US Open, tied ninth in the Open and tied 24th in the PGA. </p> <p>The world championship events are not majors but they are the next step down and, if Woods was to win this week, it would be a step towards saying the era has not yet ended. </p> <p>During his days at college in Arizona, England's Paul Casey beat some of the tournament records established by Woods and seemed a certainty to do very well, very quickly when he turned professional. But this season he shares one thing with Woods: he has not yet won a strokeplay event. </p> <p>Last week at the PGA he did not even get the chance, taking seven at his last hole to miss the cut by one stroke and, all in all, has had a season of muted satisfaction. </p> <p>He has done well enough to be currently in the Ryder Cup team - in seventh place - but knows he cannot yet relax. In fact he feels he has not relaxed all year and that he has been thinking about the Ryder Cup too much. \"Even at the PGA\" he said yesterday, \"I was thinking badly. </p> <p>\"I should have been focusing on the job in hand and trying to win the PGA. But I was guilty of thinking about the Ryder Cup. If I just play well, everything falls into place.\" </p> <p>Playing well this week will be a priority given that six figure sums in dollars are available for the first 12 finishers and dramatic movement in the Ryder Cup standings can still take place.</p>",
  "<p>For most of us, vacuuming the carpet or using the CD player is a simple thing. You plug in and switch on. But in one small part of the UK, it's a very different matter. When people want to use an electrical appliance, they look out of the window: if the trees are bent by the breeze, they can play a CD. And if the weather is really kicking up - they may be able to check their emails. </p> <p>Welcome to one of the most remote, beautiful and peculiar places in Europe: Scoraig, a peninsula on the far north-west coast of Scotland. Here, in the absence of roads and mains electricity, a strange and possibly unique environmental subculture has grown up: the whole community, of a hundred or so people, relies on boots and boats to get about, and, even more remarkably, on small, DIY windmills for almost all its electricity. </p> <p>Scoraig's reliance on domestic windpower dates back three decades. Paul Gipe, Californian author of the definitive Wind Power for Home and Business, thinks the experiments on Scoraig are heroic and exemplary. \"In the field of domestic wind power what they're doing is globally important. And it's all down to Hugh Piggot.\" </p> <p>Although he's not a household name, the Cambridge-educated Scot is one of the most famous figures in the world's windpower community. He settled on Scoraig in 1974, in his early 20s. \"We all wanted to be self-sufficient. But, without mains, the electricity situation was grim,\" he recalls. \"Some people were starting to use diesel generators, yet the cost and hassle were prohibitive - you had to ferry fuel over the loch, and the generators were noisy and dirty.\" </p> <p>With his cousin Topher he started experimenting with designs for power-producing windmills. While building sturdy windmills wasn't difficult, getting reliable juice out of them was. \"My first attempt used a bicycle hub dynamo. I put the windmill on top of the roof and attached it to the dynamo - it kind of worked, but it was very noisy. So I kept refining.\" </p> <p>About 1980 Hugh came across Austin Champ jeep dynamos. These offered 24 volts and were \"very well made\". Hugh attached them to some two-blade, 6ft-diameter windmills manufactured in the Scoraig boatyard, and produced an output of about 300 watts. </p> <p>These windmills soon became defunct, however. \"The Champ dynamos were complex, high maintenance, and they needed an initial charge to function.\" So Piggot turned to permanent magnet alternators, which he found simple to maintain, and much easier to mend. Most importantly, these alternators didn't need any electricity merely to get them started. </p> <p>But electricity storage was a problem - and still is. \"Wind power is intrinsically unreliable and intermittent. If the wind drops the voltage drops and you can't run big appliances. To store the electricity, we have to use lead-acid batteries. This isn't ideal, practically or environmentally. The batteries are bulky, and cost a lot, even when we get second-hand ones from old post office exchanges. And clean disposal of used batteries is a nightmare.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, the success is such that Piggot's windmills are exported all over the world. They are even manufactured to his design in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>The latest basic model consists of three softwood blades, each about 2.3m long. The turbine is stabilised with guys, and a \"furling tail\" to safely angle the windmill into the breeze. Piggot then installs a suitable alternator behind the blades. \"You can actually make these from the brake drum of a small van or car.\" </p> <p>\"And that's basically it,\" he says. \"You run a cable down the windmill, and into your home. Bingo.\" </p> <p>Variations on these windmills are now powering most of the homes on Scoraig. Its primary and secondary schools (the smallest in the UK) must be almost unique in Europe in their reliance on renewable energy. </p> <p>However, the schools also have a diesel generator. And this is because, as Piggot admits, there are problems with his windpower arrangements, aside from the batteries. \"The current we get from the turbines varies in quality. It can be a bit crude and raw - it has a squared off sine-wave if you want to be technical - so then you can only use it for less sensitive purposes, water heating and so on. So some people have back-up generators as well. And some people just want mains installed.\" </p> <p>What the variation in current means in practice is that if a Scoraigite wants really want pure juice - to get a totally clear line on a telephone, or a TV screen without interference - they may have to wait for reliable voltage: ie, for a good stiff wind. Hugh adds: \"That's why some people on Scoraig have two or three wiring systems - for different qualities of electricity.\" </p> <p>So what do the people of Scoraig think of their set-up? Cathy Dagg, an archaeologist, lives on Scoraig with her husband and daughter. Though she admits there are problems, she is an enthusiast: \"Yes, we've got two different electrical systems, for superior and inferior current. Which means two different sets of sockets for different kinds of appliances. If I plug a hoover and a toaster into the same system, it crashes. And sometimes when the wind drops you don't get any power at all, because the batteries run dry. Relying on renewable energy is still great, though. It feels better. Like sailing.\" </p> <p>A slightly more sceptical view comes from Kathrin Cooper, who runs a yoga retreat called Shanti Griha. \"I'm not wholly convinced. Wind power is fine as an ideal, but it's actually an expensive option. You're talking maybe \u00a33,000 for the windmill, alternator, and batteries. Then you have to replace the batteries every five to 10 years, and then throw the batteries away - somewhere. Mains electricity would probably be a lot easier; it would certainly be cheaper.\" </p> <p>\"Another paradox is that we're trying to be self-reliant, yet we're all reliant on Hugh when the windmills break,\" she laughs. \"I guess we didn't come to Scoraig for the easy life.\" </p> <p>Piggot defends his system: \"In a way our problems with windpower here on Scoraig are the same as for the wind-power industry as a whole. With certain aspects, like storage, the technology hasn't quite caught up with our aspirations - yet.\" </p> <p>But he insists that renewable energy has to be the long-term answer, especially in somewhere like Scotland, with so much potential through wind and tidal power. \"I like to think that, in our small way, we've proved that you can do it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Why are childcare horror stories always limited to toddlers? The hidden camera film of bullying staff in the recent BBC documentary Nurseries Undercover was harrowing. But childcare extends beyond the age of four. If a hidden camera followed a group of teenagers around, the results would be even worse. </p> <p>This summer holiday, the Daycare Trust warned that there was a serious shortage of provision for teenagers. While parents will ensure their children under 13 have structured activities and childcare this summer, few will do the same for older children. How many parents know what their teenagers are doing this summer? </p> <p>It's tough to be an adolescent, but so much tougher to be the parent of one. A report last month found that six out of 10 parents believe it's harder for them to bring up their teenagers than it was for their own parents. Of course, this is subjective rather than scientific data, but few would argue that parenting adolescents has got any easier. </p> <p>Last month's Family Report 2004 by the Institute of Public Policy Research found that parents are anxious that they can't afford to buy the things their teenagers want. They also worry about drugs, alcohol and crime. A generation ago the teenage years were deemed trying; today they are considered perilous. </p> <p>Newspapers scream about \"epidemics\" of pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases and violence among young people. Teenagers are frequently depicted as ungovernable, and their parents are blamed. So far, the government has responded with antisocial behaviour orders, which are mostly targeted at teenagers, and by giving the police powers to break up small groups of teens who are repeatedly disruptive. </p> <p>Three-quarters of parents surveyed thought that the teenage years were the most difficult to deal with - worse than coping with a toddler. While both age groups are similar in their testing of boundaries and their temper tantrums, the former will usually say \"I love you\" afterwards - while a teenager may still refuse to be seen with you in public. Yet almost 70% of parents said that society was far more supportive of parents with younger children than of those with teenagers. </p> <p>Teenagers have always been attracted to adult rights without the accompanying responsibilities. But the internet and growth of television channels bombard teenagers with influences, aspirations and marketing messages that catapult them into the adult world far earlier than a generation ago. Much of this television and internet use occurs unsupervised. Working parents don't employ nannies for their 13-year-olds. When parents do get home they are often tired, and conversations focus on \"Have you done your homework?\" or \"Have you tidied your room?\" </p> <p>As the number of children living in lone-parent families increases, research shows that lone parents find it harder to deal with teenagers because they feel so unsupported. Many more families are reconstituted, providing the potential for a difficult step-parent dynamic. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Home Office says that drug use has increased, and starts earlier among teenagers. One in three 14-year-olds has taken drugs (mostly cannabis), rising to two out of five 16-year-olds. About 10% of 12-year-olds say they regularly have a drink, and by the age of 15 this rises to 30%. </p> <p>But some of the difficulties in parenting teenagers are more timeless in nature. These young people need to become independent of their parents. Their peer group inevitably has the greatest influence. At secondary school, parents don't compare parenting problems outside the school gates. With no yardstick against which to measure how they're doing, parents may be too liberal, afraid of alienating their child by setting boundaries. Many studies have shown that the best parenting for teenagers combines open communication, negotiation, warmth and authority. </p> <p>In the UK, the government has spent millions of pounds on its Sure Start programme, which supports families of young children, particularly those in poverty. It is families with exactly the same economic profile that have the most problems with their teenagers. Sure Start is working well but, as the IPPR report notes, it needs to be extended. Instead of after-school clubs, teenagers need youth and sporting centres. </p> <p>A quarter of parents with children under six have asked employers to let them work flexibly since the new law allowed them to do so in April 2002. But many parents with teenagers also need that flexibility. Parents also need to talk to and support each other, and secondary schools could facilitate this by holding parenting groups. The most vulnerable parents need parenting classes, but all parents need to reclaim their teenagers - not to ignore them because they don't seem to want them, or to give them more freedom than they think is safe, or more money than they can afford. </p> <p>There are signs the government is taking more interest in teenagers and may help parents to help themselves. Its five-year education strategy - which will include a green paper on youth - also reintroduces school uniforms, relieving an economic pressure on parents to help their teenagers compete with each other, and making it harder for children to play truant. </p> <p>Alongside any government initiatives, parents themselves need to show to their own teenagers that they're available for them. A poll in the United States by the YMCA found that, while parents cite the fear of drugs as their main concern, teenagers listed not having enough time with their parents. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Luisa Dillner is head of BMJ Learning at the British Medical Journal </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ldillner@bmj.com\">ldillner@bmj.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Number Two </strong><br> </p> <p>Hello my darling, hello my little boy,\" said Trixie Penfound, 70, as she tentatively climbed the stairs above the muddy watermark across her walls. </p> <p>Returning to her home for the first time since the river Jordan burst its banks and smashed through Marine Terrace's seven cottages, Mrs Penfound was relieved to find Oscar, her cat, safe upstairs. </p> <p>She had moved into number two of the historic row, built for the village coastguards in the 18th century, 18 years ago with her daughter, Nicola. Now, a lifetime's collection of furniture was ruined. </p> <p>Together they picked through the mud of their wrecked two-bedroom home. A grandmother clock lay on its front; the water had piled kitchen chairs into the living room, where they lay covered in mud next to a heap of ruined books, videotapes, cushions, two mahogany side tables and a soft toy elephant. Twigs and dirt covered an antique clock, stopped, on the mantelpiece. </p> <p>On Tuesday Mrs Penfound was close to tears; yesterday she was remarkably sanguine. \"This is nothing,\" she said as she swept a hand around her dark and damp living room. \"We can fix this. We can put it right. No lives have been lost. We're grateful we've got insurance ... \" </p> <p>\" ... And we're grateful we've got each other,\" her daughter interjected. </p> <p>To make matters worse, the storm had put Nicola out of work. Her seasonal job as a chambermaid at the Riverside hotel, also wrecked by the storm, is over until at least next year. </p> <p>Loss adjusters warned Mrs Penfound yesterday it would be at least two months before she and her daughter could live in their house again. There is no electricity, no water and no sewage. Their walls are sodden and the whole house needs replastering. </p> <p>Mrs Penfound estimated the 18cm (seven inches) of rain which fell in five hours on Monday afternoon almost halved the value of her home. No one will want to live there, knowing it could be flooded so quickly. </p> <p>\"I'm not angry at all,\" she said. \"I feel it is fate. We have got all too materialistic. This could almost be a sign that we are too attached to our possessions. The value of my property has dropped by half but I'm not unhappy. </p> <p>\"I don't blame anyone for this disaster. I've never blamed anyone for anything in my life and I think that's because I'm Cornish. We're a resilient race.\" </p> <p><strong> Number three </strong><br> </p> <p>Frances Hegarty and Howard Baker bought their picturesque cottage, with wisteria on the walls and a slate roof, four years ago. Mr Baker's mother Gladys, 93, lives in number one. After spending months restoring their home, they moved in last year. </p> <p>\"I moved away from Battersea in [south-west] London to come for the stress-free life down here and now look what's happened,\" said Ms Hegarty, standing by the gravel, mud and sandbags that covered their front garden after the river burst through their back door and ploughed a new course into the terrace's front gardens. The residents of Marine Terrace laboured all day to return the river to its normal culvert, running below their back gardens. </p> <p>\"We just saw it coming up and up and then the back door caved in and the fridge freezer went on its side and the sofa went upside down,\" Ms Hegarty said. They got out, but Gladys was trapped upstairs with her cats. \"It was awful. It was very scary.\" </p> <p>\"Now I don't know where to start,\" she said. \"Everything is gone. There's no water, no sewage. The kitchen is waist-high with slate and rubble. It has taken us four years to do that cottage up. We've just got it finished and then this.\" </p> <p>As she laboured with her neighbours to redirect the river, Ms Hegarty fished Gladys's purse out of the mud. </p> <p>\"I'm more worried about Gladys' things,\" she said. \"She had 800 books, collected over 90 years. Proper, old hardbacks. The water came up and at least half of them on the shelves are ruined. I haven't the heart to tell her yet.\" </p> <p><strong> Number four</strong><br> </p> <p>Raymund Rogers stood on a heap of slate, mud and debris three metres (10ft) high behind Marine Terrace. The cottage's gardens, once festooned with fuchsias, were a jumble of ruined objects: televisions, a microwave oven, an armchair, a log, a chest of drawers, a remote control, three mugs, two courgettes, one trainer and a full packet of Celebrations chocolates. </p> <p>\"I'm very fortunate,\" said Mr Rogers, a local artist who sells his paintings in London and recently had his cottage repainted. Like the others in the terrace, he felt he got off lightly compared to those whose homes have been totally destroyed. </p> <p>\"On the positive side, this row was built to a very high spec. They knew about the river when they built them in the 18th century and the building is very solid.\" </p> <p>Another thing that survived was his wine. \"My wine cellar is over there,\" he said. He pointed to a collection of 40 muddy bottles. \"I rescued it, and it is going to be very interesting drinking it because all the labels have come off.\" </p> <p>\"When we were all working to save the terrace yesterday, in all honesty I felt blessed,\" he said. \"Tears were in my eyes but they were tears of joy at seeing the community come together.\" </p> <p> <strong> Number six</strong><br> </p> <p>After a sunny day at their small farm less than 20 miles away in Launceston, Sandy Chandler and Martin Towers turned on the six o'clock news. They could hardly believe the pictures of Boscastle being swept out to sea. </p> <p>Fearing the worst, they hurried over to their cottage which they let as a holiday home. When the police let them through the barricades, they found their neighbours, and other villagers, had diverted the water away from their door. </p> <p>\"The community spirit has been unbelievable,\" said Mr Towers. \"I got here yesterday and people had already dug a trench to get the water out of my property. I had a couple of guys who I recognised from the village working with me. I haven't got a clue who they are, but they flogged their guts out to help.\" </p> <p>They have lost their income for the rest of the year but with a small farm and a curtain-making business, they said they would not starve. </p> <p>\"You think you've got mother nature tamed but you haven't really,\" said Mr Towers.</p>",
  "<p>Never underestimate Microsoft. At the end of last year, the software giant seemed to be struggling to stay in favour with its biggest customer outside the US, the British taxpayer. Across the public sector, a climate of opinion was forming behind the use of open source software, not just on the server but on the desktop. </p> <p>This week, however, Microsoft's control of the government desktop looks as secure as ever. It announced a 10-year partnership (subject to compulsory break-points) with the London borough of Newham. The deal follows a decision by the NHS to go with Microsoft for large parts of the new national patient-record system. </p> <p>Newham is a worthy catch for Microsoft. The Financial Times commented snootily that the council \"is not generally regarded as an information technology trailblazer\". In fact, Newham has an excellent reputation for pioneering on e-services. </p> <p>Two years ago, the government chose the borough to launch a national strategy for local e-government. In 2003, Newham continued to set the pace by hiring a consultancy, Netproject, to develop and demonstrate an IT architecture based on open source software. This rattled Microsoft, which was facing an open source movement by local authorities across Europe. </p> <p>Microsoft drew a line in the sand. It agreed a package of price cuts for software and goodies such as Tablet PCs, in a deal worth about \u00a3500,000 a year. It also paid for Capgemini, an IT consultancy, to evaluate the \"costs, business bene fits and risk profiles\" of Newham's choice. The result, triumphantly unveiled by Microsoft this week, was that when the costs of migration were taken into account, the council would save twice as much money from the Microsoft deal than by going to open source. The study was done with a methodology developed by the Gartner market analysis firm for analysing total cost of ownership. </p> <p>Open source enthusiasts pooh-poohed the findings, and pointed out that migration costs are a one-off, while licence fees are ongoing. But the study will be hard to ignore. </p> <p>Although Newham's experience has attracted much attention, it is only one authority out of 468 in the UK. The NHS deal affects two-thirds of the health service in England. Under a series of contracts worth some \u00a33bn, every health authority north of the Thames Valley will install a system being developed by a specialist firm called iSoft, Microsoft's main healthcare partner in the UK. </p> <p>Despite this foothold, the open source movement in government is far from dead. Next month is likely to bring a resurgence of interest when results emerge from government-sponsored trials of the technology. Meanwhile, 60 open source companies will form a new consortium to promote open source in the public sector. </p> <p>However, Microsoft too has something up its sleeve: a new government-wide pricing deal negotiated with the NHS's leverage. Although open source will nibble away and continue to find converts, the national deal, currently going through the Treasury, could be an offer the civil servants find hard to refuse.</p>",
  "Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, suffered a massive blow to his project to withdraw from settlements in the Gaza Strip last night when his party refused to allow him to invite new partners into the government who might have backed his plans. <p>Party rebels won key ballots at a convention, with about 60% voting in favour of a motion to prevent Mr Sharon introducing the Labour party into the Likud-led government. </p> <p>The result is not binding, and Mr Sharon vowed before the voting of the Likud central committee that he would plough ahead regardless. </p> <p>\"Likud will not disqualify or boycott anyone,\" he told party members, as hecklers chanted, \"yes to Likud, no to Labour\". </p> <p>He continued: \"The Likud will conduct negotiations with all Zionist parties for expanding the coalition.\" </p> <p>But the latest rebuff comes after the wider party voted in a referendum in May against dismantling settlements in Gaza, and observers are now wondering if the prime minister can continue to lead his divided party. </p> <p>Dalia Itzik, a spokeswoman for the Labour party, said new elections were all but inevitable as Mr Sharon would emerge from the vote a \"lame duck prime minister\". </p> <p>In his pre-vote speech, Mr Sharon had tried to harness the spirits of past leaders of the Israeli right wing. </p> <p>\"You must make your voices heard loud and strong, a national and responsible voice, like the voice of Menachem Begin who prevented a civil war on the eve of Israel's establishment and who led to unity on the eve of the six day war ... Israel is waiting for that,\" he said. </p> <p>The prime minister, who, more than anyone, has made the right a force in Israel, was rejected by the party he helped create. He can continue to govern but without the moral authority to do anything but manage the country. </p> <p>The debate in the Likud party has also been fuelled by a series of personal and party rivalries. \"Unfortunately there is a group within the party that has been plotting against the government since its establishment,\" Mr Sharon told the convention earlier. </p> <p>Binyamin Netanyahu, a former prime minister and current finance minister, is torn in several directions. He is from the right but appreciates Jerusalem's dependence on the US and the need to create a situation in which Israel can keep the parts of the West Bank it wants. </p> <p>Also, as finance minister he has introduced Thatcherite reforms anathema to Labour. Perhaps most importantly he has leadership ambitions of his own and is loth to make life easy for Mr Sharon. </p> <p>Silvan Shalom, the foreign minster, has clearly identified himself with the rebels because if Labour joins the coalition it is very likely he will lose his job to Shimon Peres, the opposition leader. </p> <p>And while Mr Sharon takes on his own party he is also negotiating with his current partner, Shinui, a party which has pledged never to sit in government with the ultra-orthodox groups. </p> <p>The prime minister has called their bluff and started negotiating with United Torah Judaism and Shas. Both parties demand as a minimum a halt to all Shinui-inspired secular legislation such as a bill introducing civil marriages. </p> <p>Behind all the manoeuvring is also the suggestion that Mr Sharon does not really want to form a government but would like to create a situation whereby he can call elections without being seen to be the cause of them. </p> <p>If that is so the possibility of early elections, which most Israeli pundits suggested would occur within the year, increased last night. </p> <p>According to analysts, Mr Sharon realises his divided party is no vehicle in which to attempt the withdrawal from the Gaza settlements. </p> <p>To achieve this he needs to create an electoral vehicle, combining Shinui, Labour and the centre of Likud, that can draw the maximum votes from the 60% of the Israeli population that favours withdrawal not only from Gaza but from the West Bank settlements.</p>",
  "<p>The prospect of travel misery over the August bank holiday drew closer yesterday as British Airways' biggest union voted to join a strike, while Eurostar workers backed parallel industrial action in London and Kent. </p> <p>Some 8,300 members of the Transport &amp; General Workers' union at BA overwhelmingly endorsed a 24-hour walkout next Friday in protest at a three-year pay offer worth 8.5%. </p> <p>Their vote followed a narrow strike vote last week from the smaller GMB union. The T&amp;G's chief negotiator, Brendan Gold, told a news conference at the union's head office that his members were angry about pay and he hoped the vote in favour of strikes would send a \"clear message\" to BA. </p> <p>\"We want to avert industrial action but we are giving clear notice of the determination of our members,\" he said. </p> <p>He said passengers were justified in being concerned about their travel plans. \"We don't want to disrupt people's holidays. We are determined to reach a settlement.\" </p> <p>But BA accused the T&amp;G of failing to consult its members about a revised offer tabled on Tuesday which offered staff a \u00a31,000 bonus if they cut back on their sick leave. </p> <p>Mike Street, BA's director of operations, urged both unions to hold fresh ballots on the new offer. \"This vote was based on an offer which has since been substantially improved. It would be absurd for the unions to go ahead with strikes on the basis of an old offer.\" </p> <p>The T&amp;G's ballot had a turnout of 60%. A strike was supported by two-thirds of check-in, sales and administrative staff, plus 84% of baggage handlers, drivers and loaders. The dispute involves BA's ground staff at Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow. It could bring the airline to a near-total standstill and would cause disruption for days, leaving aircraft, cabin crew and pilots in the wrong places. </p> <p>More than 100,000 people have reservations to travel with BA each day over the bank holiday weekend. Senior BA executives acknowledge the airline can ill afford a dispute against a backdrop of record fuel prices and fierce price competition. </p> <p>Travellers opting for trains could also encounter industrial action following a strike vote by 160 of Eurostar's customer service staff at Waterloo and Ashford International stations, who provide assistance to passengers. </p> <p>The employees are members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, which has objected to a regrading of pay levels. The RMT says the shakeup will mean staff at Ashford are paid \u00a34,000 less than colleagues doing identical jobs in London. </p> <p>Eurostar, which says it has seen ticket sales jump by 10% as a result of the threatened strike at BA, said yesterday it would be able to run a full service despite the walkout. </p> <p>Paul Charles, a spokesman, said sales staff and managers would fill the void left by the striking workers. </p> <p>\"The planned strike is unnecessary and will have no impact on passengers. All of our services will be operating normally as we have made thorough contingency plans.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> On the road</strong> Can you advise the growing army of readers who travel abroad with laptops how to access their British ISPs? I used to use iPass, which was very good, but it doesn't appear to be readily available these days. <br> <strong> Ian Richardson</strong> </p> <p><strong> Jack Schofield replies: </strong> iPass is still going strong but is mainly used by businesses. A newer rival called NetAway <a href=\"http://www.netaway.com\">www.netaway.com</a> looks consumer friendly and may be worth a go. In general, using a local free or pay-as-you-go ISP account should be a good solution, because at least you will be able to check your mail via the web using <a href=\"http://www.web2mail.com\">www.web2mail.com</a> or a similar service. </p> <p>You should also be able to send mail using a mail program such as Outlook Express, as long as you remember to collect mail before trying to send any. This is because many mail servers use \"POP before SMTP\" authentication to discourage spammers from relaying spam. In other words, you have to be authenticated by the inbound (POP3) mail server before it lets you send outgoing mail via SMTP. NetAway avoids this problem by running a relaying service, so you have to change your outgoing address to relay.netaway.com. </p> <p>Also, before travelling, be sure to get a proper dial-up number for your usual ISP, so that if necessary you can call directly while you are abroad. If the worst comes to the worst, you can use a web-based service to delete spam and viruses from your mailbox, then use a dial-up line or even a mobile phone connection to download important email. </p> <p><strong> Avant guard</strong> <br> How do I get rid of Mysearchnow. com? I use Avant as my browser, but it has attached itself to Internet Explorer as well. <strong> Brian Frew</strong> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> Mysearchnow.com is a version of the hated Lop (Live online portal) browser hijacker. SpyBot should be able to remove it. If it fails, try running it with your PC started in Safe Mode. For details of the Lop problem, see <a href=\"http://www.spy-bot.net/lop.asp\">www.spy-bot.net/lop.asp</a>. Incidentally, Avant - which offers tabbed browsing and popup blocking - is one of the many alternative browsers based on the same operating system components as Internet Explorer. It is not a wholly separate browser like, say, Firefox. </p> <p><strong> Ring the changes</strong><br> My PC is afflicted by regular popups from a site called 680180.net, which offers me SMS ringtones. The site repeatedly opens new instances of Internet Explorer and, if left unattended, eventually crashes the computer.  <strong> Michael Salkeld</strong> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> 680180 is advertising scumware from 680180 Inc <a href=\"http://www.680180.net\">www.680180.net</a>, and works in Windows as a Browser Helper Object (BHO). An earlier variant was called Zamingo, so it should be removed by Pest Patrol, or try the manual instructions at <a href=\"http://www.spyany.com/program/article_adw_rm_Zamingo.html\">www.spyany.com</a>. The more complicated alternative is to run HiJackThis and delete the 68010 files. For an example, see <a href=\"http://forums.spywareinfo.com/index.php?showtopic=18490\">http://forums.spywareinfo.com</a>. </p> <p><strong> Who needs it?</strong><br> I can see a commercial use for broadband, but I am yet to be convinced of any real need for ordinary computer users: it seems an expensive way of downloading DVDs, MP3s and other music files. My concern is whether providers will continue offering dial-up services, as many seem to be pushing for universal broadband.  <strong> L. Nelson</strong> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> I am sure that dial-up services will continue for many years. Most users may have access to broadband or Wi-Fi most of the time, but sometimes only dial-up will be available. However, dial-up services will become increasingly unusable as websites and email messages become larger to exploit the extra capabilities of broadband. Either way, broadband is not just about download speeds: the fact that it is \"always on\" makes a big difference to how you use the net. </p> <p><strong> Backchat</strong> </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Last week, Jonathan Carr said his PC had a wavy screen. I suggested he check the monitor cable, among other things. Niall Bacon added that it could also be a loose video card, so it might be worth removing the card and reinstalling it. Other readers found the cause was outside interference. For example, David J Jones's monitor suffered odd distortions caused by an oscillating fan. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Andy Brown's query about renumbering 2,000 image files attracted a large response. Software developer Alex Marland recommended a freeware application, AF5.5 <a href=\"http://www.fauland.com\">Rename Your Files</a> for ease of use and control. Many readers suggested using the rename function in their picture viewing and management software: Jim Elks recommend ACDSee, Steven Pickett the freeware program, Irfanview, while James Carter picked the powerful <a href=\"http://www.photools.com\">IMtach</a>. Iain Row of Prominent Media Ltd wrote Andy a short bit of VBScript to do the job. Finally, Matthew Pescud wanted a follow-up answer on renaming MP3 files so he can store tracks in alphabetical order. Any suggestions? </p>"
