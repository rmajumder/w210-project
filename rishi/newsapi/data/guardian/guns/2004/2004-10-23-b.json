  "<p>When Gordon Brown stands up to deliver his autumn pre-Budget report, due by early December, it will be the usual tub-thumping recital of his greatest hits: unemployment at its lowest level since the 1970s; the longest uninterrupted period of growth since records began; public debt repayments slashed since the dark days of Tory rule. While he sticks to his familiar theme tune, though, his critics will be murmuring the t-word - tax. The government is boxed into the tightest financial corner since Labour came to power, and there is a growing consensus that, once the election is out of the way, Brown will be left with little option but to push up taxes to get himself back on track. </p> <p>The Chancellor's spending habits are constrained by his self-imposed 'golden rule' - he allows himself to borrow only to fund investment, so other spending has to be balanced against receipts over the economic cycle. If he dips into the red in a lean year, he has to make up for it by running a surplus in healthier times. </p> <p>The Treasury reckons the current cycle began in 1999-2000, when Brown was sticking to strict Tory spending plans and running up chunky surpluses. It is projected to end in 2005-06. On the latest estimates, made in this year's Budget, he is due to meet his golden rule with a wafer-thin margin of \u00a311 billion to spare. </p> <p>Since those plans were written, much of the economic news has been bad: oil prices have shot up to record highs above $50 a barrel, and few analysts expect them to come down any time soon; consumer spending and the housing market are showing signs of the long-awaited slowdown; and the US economic recovery seems to have hit the skids. Brown is pinning his hopes on economic growth of 3-3.5 per cent in 2005, to bring the tax receipts rolling in; but the consensus among experts is now 2.5 per cent. 'I do feel that his forecasts are too optimistic,' says Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. Simon Rubinsohn, of City brokers Gerrard, agrees: 'If you stick with the forecasts, you're leaving yourself open to the criticism that you're not responding to global developments.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, the latest snapshot of the public finances, released last week, showed that, even this year, with growth expected to live up to Brown's expectations, current spending is expanding too quickly for him to hit the \u00a310.5bn deficit he is expecting. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, Britain's top tax think-tank, says that at this rate the deficit on the current budget could be as large as \u00a322bn, gobbling up his margin for error and leaving him no choice but to bust the rule next year. The Treasury recently tweaked the way it assesses the rule, measuring the average budget deficit as a proportion of GDP over the cycle, instead of looking at the raw cash figures; but the analysts say which ever way you look at it he's in danger. </p> <p>Fortunately for Brown, it's the Treasury that decides when the economic cycle ends. He could announce in the pre-Budget report that he thinks the economy has picked up more quickly than expected, so that the cycle ends in 2004-5, allowing him to meet the golden rule, and emerge from the next election with a clean sheet. </p> <p>But Oliver Letwin, the Tory Shadow Chancellor, says there will have to be a reckoning after the election. 'He provided himself, I think wrongly, with the ability to fiddle the assessment of the timing of the cycle, and because of that he will find a way of not breaching the rule in advance of the election; but he then faces the fact, if he's re-elected, that he's starting a new cycle without the surpluses with which he began the last cycle, and with runaway spending.' Letwin believes the probability that taxes will have to go up to make the sums work in the longer term is '99.9 per cent'. </p> <p>Christine Frayne, of the IFS, agrees that moving the end of the cycle forwards 'would increase the need for tax increases or spending cuts to ensure that the rule is met over the next economic cycle'. And cuts are difficult, with plans already pencilled in for every year until 2008, under which spending will expand at the same rate as the economy. 'He's in a really tight position,' says Loynes. 'The elbow room built into the fiscal rules has diminished. It may be that he can just about cling on to the current forecast; but it leaves whoever is there after the election almost certainly having to raise taxes.' </p> <p>Letwin says that, despite Brown's commitment to cut civil service posts and pare back costs, his political priorities, and the powerful momentum that has built up behind spending in Whitehall, make it impossible for him to alter the path of future spending. </p> <p>'The point is, it's become a structural deficit, because his current spending on bureaucracy is out of control. He would like to control it, but he can't. The ineluctable consequence is that you have to raise taxes.' </p> <p>The Treasury refuses to accept that logic. 'There will be absolutely no softening of the golden rule,' a spokesman says, dismissing doubts about its forecasts. But if Letwin, the IFS and the City are right, the timing could be exceptionally tricky for the Chancellor. Selling tax increases to a public who are simultaneously being told they must save more for their retirement, or to a business sector facing soaring costs and tough competition, would take all Brown's considerable political acumen. Not only that, but being labelled a tax and spend chancellor, instead of the man who abolished boom and bust, would make a tricky platform from which to launch a leadership bid.</p>",
  "<p>The National Association of Estate Agents says the average property price in the UK fell for the fourth consecutive month in September. Prices were on average 1.6 per cent lower than the previous month, bringing the annual increase down to 7.95 per cent and the average price to \u00a3197,633.

Unadopted roads do not reach the minimum standards set by the local authority and therefore do not receive any maintenance and in some cases may not have basic services such as drainage and street lighting. Mike Charlesworth, property partner at Glaisyers, says: 'Some homebuyers like unadopted roads because they can be signposted \"private\", while others are so full of potholes that they become a safe haven for children to play as cars are discouraged from driving along them.' But if the local council adopts a road, the people living in it will be forced to pay the full cost of bringing it up to standard, which can cost as much as \u00a320,000. <a href=\"http://www.glaisyers.com\">www.glaisyers.com</a> 0161 832 4666.</p> <p>London homeowners might be more inclined to back the capital's 2012 Olympic bid in light of research by Halifax, showing the regeneration effects of hosting the games could have a positive impact on house prices.

  "The troubles of Craig Murray, the sacked British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, appear at first glance to be a shocking exception to the rules of public life. When was the last time you heard of a case of a diplomat accused of drunken orgies and sexual blackmail after he had discomforted his masters in Whitehall? You don't have to be Michael Moore to wonder if the Foreign Office needed to revert to the unparalleled tactic of tipping wheelbarrow loads of dirt over Murray to bury his bad news that Britain was in the market for information extracted by torturers. <p>Murray's allegation is shocking because, say what you like about England, it has shunned torture for centuries. If you look a bit closer, however, you find that torture is no longer as exceptional as it once was. With many a sigh and expression of regret the Government is reaching an arrangement with torturers, and not only in Uzbekistan. English judges have accepted that confessions beaten out of suspects can be used for the first time since the 1630s. The only reaction, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, could manage to their extraordinary decision was the Peck sniffian bleat that he had the 'awful feeling' that learning to live with torture 'is probably the right conclusion.' As with so many other descents into barbarism, the judges and ministers make each step on the downward path appear eminently reasonable. </p> <p>However strenuously the wishful thinkers of Western liberalism deny there is much to worry about, Islamism remains a psychopathic and totalitarian creed which sanctions the indiscriminate murder of countless victims. Reasonable governments know that the battle must be joined and that they must work to prevent crimes beyond the imagination of the world before 11 September. </p> <p>But how should the security services react? Take the example of Murray's Uzbekistan. It is caught in the same vice as many Muslim countries. On one side is a repressive government. On the other is an opposition some of whose members are turning to Islamism. You might have thought MI6 would be watching. Right and left fantasise about the spies' reach and power: they either uncover deadly subversives or target every 'freedom' movement according to political taste. Both parties are united by the assumption that the security services have a competence bordering on the omniscient. What else is the near-universally believed charge that Blair lied about Iraq based on but the delusory notion that John Scarlett of the Joint Intelligence Committee and Sir Richard Dearlove of MI6 knew that Saddam had disarmed and were silenced? </p> <p>In fact MI6 doesn't have one spy in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan or any of the other dangerous central Asian republics. It's a small organisation which employs about 2000 people, many of them support staff. Even if it did have the resources to put men in Tashkent, what could they do? Roam Uzbekistan breaking into houses and interrogating suspects? In the circumstances it seems a reasonable step for the Foreign Office to take information from the oppressive governments of central Asia and the Middle East, even if there is a danger that it has been extracted by torturers. And it would be reasonable if, say, a plot by Uzbek exiles in London was treated simply as a tip-off which led to searches, surveillance and all the other normal means for collecting evidence which would stand up in a British court. If torture was involved, it would be somewhere far back down the line in a foreign country of which we knew little. The integrity of the case brought against the suspects in Britain wouldn't be threatened. </p> <p>What is now threatening the integrity of the criminal justice system is the internment of foreign terrorist suspects without trial or knowledge of the charges against them. Their claim that their detention is illegal was rejected by the Court of Appeal in August and is cur rently being considered by the Law Lords. Most media attention has been on the main argument by human rights groups that the law is discriminatory because it allows foreigners to be detained indefinitely while British citizens enjoy full civil rights. This is one of the many occasions when liberals should be careful of what they wish for. </p> <p>The Government could very easily become a model of impartiality by interning British citizens alongside the alleged enemy aliens. David Blunkett has dropped strong hints that he would want to do just that if there was an Islamist attack on Britain, and I doubt if he would be stopped by a wave of public revulsion. </p> <p>Far less attention has been given to the ruling by two of the three judges on the Court of Appeal that it was fine to hold men on the basis of evidence extracted by torture. No one can actually say that this happened because, contrary to all the principles of English justice, they aren't allowed to know what they are meant to have done. But their lawyers suspect that they have been jailed because of confessions from inmates at Guantanamo Bay who have been threatened with dogs, stripped and kept in solitary confinement. Their allegation goes way beyond the charge that the security services followed up leads from brutal foreign agencies. It suggests that people are being held indefinitely in British jails because a naked man beset by dogs named him to placate his tormentors. </p> <p>So what, snapped the Court of Appeal. There is no other way, blubbed Lord Falconer. </p> <p>Their accommodation with torture is astonishing on many levels. The first is its hypocrisy. The court said that the British state was still forbidden from conniving in or procuring torture. If its agents reached for the cosh or the electric flex, they would be breaking the law. But if evidence extracted by foreign torturers was now admissible, why should the gloves be kept on British hardmen? Why should our boys be held back simply because of their British citizenship? </p> <p>The Court of Appeal had no coherent answer, and the nonchalance with which it endorsed foreign torturers showed how feeble national traditions have become. Until the war of terror, it was inconceivable that an English court would accept that a man could be jailed on the basis of torture, albeit torture conducted by shifty foreigners. The English didn't do torture. Uniquely in medieval Christendom, the English common law forbad the extraction of evidence under duress. </p> <p>The exception to the benign rule was the Court of Star Chamber, which was allowed to torture the king's enemies. Its barbaric practices were one cause of the civil war. Such was the hatred it aroused that 'Star Chamber justice' remains a contemptuous condemnation of arbitrary power to this day. </p> <p>Writing at the high point of liberal Victorian self-confidence Lord Macaulay said that Star Chamber was an aberration which, 'after the lapse of more than two centuries,' was still 'held in deep abhorrence by the nation'. It 'displayed a rapacity, a violence, a malignant energy, which had been unknown to any former age'. I'm not sure if the English can be quite as self-confident about the decency of the national tradition today. It's not that Star Chamber is back, rather that, as with so many other services, torture has been out-sourced to the third world where bothersome regulation is less intrusive. </p> <p>What is dispiriting about the degeneracy of the Government and the Court of Appeal is that the old lessons have to be learned once again. The reasons why first England and then the civilised world rejected torture were practical as well as moral. Most people break under torture. Most people say whatever they have to say to stop the pain. When names are suggested to them, they agree. If the torturer wants to implicate the innocent or invent imaginary plots, he usually gets what he wants from his victim. </p> <p>If the Law Lords doubt the wisdom of centuries and are considering upholding the Court of Appeal's verdict, may I suggest a small experiment? If they give me a law officer, the Lord Chancellor perhaps, or the Director of Public Prosecutions, and a couple of heavies, and leave us alone in a locked room, I think I can guarantee that within a week he will have revealed that the entire senior judiciary are members of al-Qaeda.</p>",
  "Better late than never. Mongolia, jewel of the freezing steppes, is joining the 21st century - by giving its citizens second names. In a nation where everyone is known simply as Ganaa or Serjee, the move is considered by the government to be a vital step to progress. Phone books, newspaper bylines, credit cards and other modern wonders will now follow in the wake of this decree, say officials. <p>Sadly, reality has proved to be more problematic. Charged with picking a historic name or an ancestor's moniker for their surname, more than half the population plumped for the one Mongolian that they believe put their country on the map: Ghengis Khan, the 12th century warrior who did for the civilised world what Alastair Campbell did for government integrity. </p> <p>His clan name - Borjigin - has been picked by thousands of Mongolians, thus threatening to make nonsense of the government's name game. </p> <p>So to help perplexed Mongolians, Serjee, a director of the State Central Library of Mongolia, has produced a helpful guide, the Los Angeles Times reveals. Look for local histories that might reveal your clan name, he advises - although finding an original name does not guarantee you will want to use it. 'My research suggests most original surnames were bestowed by neighbours in the village,' Serjee said. 'These include \"Thief\" and \"Family of Seven Drunks\".' </p> <p>The surnames law was originally passed in 1997 but was ignored until the recent introduction of a new system of identity cards.</p>",

It would be more interesting to ask 'How did it come about?', a question some film student might write a dissertation on. In 1962, Bill Naughton wrote a fine BBC radio play, a study of working-class Don Juanism called Alfie Elkins and His Little Life starring Bill Owen, the action covering some 20 years from the early days of the Second World War to the late 1950s. </p> <p>The narrator (an obvious stand-in for the author) meets the eponymous Alfie (born around 1916) from time to time and is updated about his exploits. At Bernard Miles's urging, Naughton turned it into a play for the Mermaid Theatre, where Alfie was played by John Neville, one of the most handsome classical actors of the day. </p> <p>Two years later, in 1966, it became a key example of Swinging London cinema, with a Bacharach and David title song, a Sonny Rollins score and Michael Caine on his way to stardom as the amorous cockney chauffeur talking directly to the audience about his amoral pursuits of glamorous birds. The film took place in no discernible span of time and Alfie never ages, though the point may well have been that you're past it in your late twenties. </p> <p>Now in his fourth reincarnation (or fifth if you include the long-forgotten 1975 film Alfie Darling starring Alan Price), Jude Law plays Alfie as an irresistible cockney expat driving a stretch limo in Manhattan and bedding a string of local beauties. As on the stage and in the Caine film, Alfie is a nonstop talker, as garrulous and self-justifying as Casanova, though in order to clear up things from the start we see a pack of condoms at his bedside. </p> <p>The only time he has unsafe sex is a drunken fling with his best friend's girl. She gets pregnant and attracts the unlikely compliment from the middle-aged Jewish widow in the adjoining flat: 'Good for you dating an African-American, Alfie.' This pregnancy doesn't result in an abortion, which was the one truly memorable scene of the Caine movie, with Vivien Merchant so moving as the married woman he'd knocked up and Denholm Elliott unbearably sad as the struck-off doctor performing the illegal termination. </p> <p>Taking place over a few months, Alfie doesn't make much sense in a Manhattan populated by independent women and liberated swingers, and his comeuppance, such as it is (pangs of guilt, temporary impotence, dropped by a professional woman in favour of a toy boy, loneliness), lacks moral power or poignancy. </p> <p>It's also surprisingly unerotic and rarely amusing, though a doctor specialising in erectile dysfunction is given a comic foreign accent and a mincing gay manner that recalls the wedding organiser in Shyer's appalling remake of Father of the Bride . How inferior Alfie is to John O'Hara's Pal Joey stories and the Rodgers and Hart musical they inspired, or Dylan Kidd's recent Roger Dodger , with Campbell Scott as the desperate Don Juan of New York's singles' bars. </p> <p>The Princess Diaries, Garry Marshall's romantic comedy about a San Francisco schoolgirl (Anne Hathaway) discovering she's Princess Mia, the granddaughter of Queen Clarisse (Julie Andrews) and heir to the European throne of Genovia, was pretty terrible. The sequel, <strong> The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement</strong>, in which the 21-year-old Mia comes to Genovia after graduating from Princeton to be told she must marry within a month or forfeit the throne, is infinitely worse. </p> <p>It's a Midwestern small-town schoolgirl's dream of being a princess and living in luxury. Think of Call Me Madam , remade for the Disney Channel without Ethel Merman, the Berlin songs and the wit. The only tasteful item in the hideous decor of the Genovian royal palace is Gainsborough's Mary, Countess Howe , obviously on loan from Kenwood House for Mia's wedding. </p> <p>I emerged from the Princess Diaries 2 eager to see Alien Vs Princess Mia or Predator Vs Queen Clarisse. Instead I had to endure <strong>Alien Vs Predator</strong>, written and directed by British film-maker Paul WS Anderson, whose principal task was to link two horror franchises. The first two Alien pictures were masterly, the third and fourth problematic, while John McTiernan's Predator was superb, and its sequel dismal. </p> <p>This picture begins knowingly as some scientists watch the 1943 Universal flick Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman. Suddenly, their attention is drawn to another screen revealing strange activity 2,000 feet under an island in Antarctica. Before you can sing the first verse of 'Just One of Those Things', billionaire industrialist Lance Henriksen has gathered a team of scientists, archaeologists, engineers and wilderness guides to investigate what appears to be a giant prehistorical pyramid, part Cambodian, part-Mexican, part-Egyptian. </p> <p>Eventually, a feeble flashback explains the movie's backstory. Meanwhile, the familiar half-visible Predator and his chums, violent metal-encased killers, and the equally familiar Alien and his slimy crew, all teeth and acidic saliva, have wiped out most of Henriksen's expedition and fought among each other. Largely made in Czech studios, it's murky, derivative and a very tired affair, all over in 90 minutes, followed by 10 minutes of credits. </p> <p>Hideo Nagata's thriller <strong> Chaos</strong>, made in 1999 between his Ring films and the recent Dark Water , is a film noir in which the wife of a wealthy Tokyo banker talks a young handyman into helping fake her kidnapping as a way of punishing her errant husband. It's an extended homage to Hitchcock's Vertigo that keeps you puzzled and on your toes by going backwards in time as much as it moves forwards, the flashbacks arriving unannounced. Cool, fascinating, ingenious. </p> <p>Shot on the Isle of Man (with a cameo appearance by the island's most celebrated citizen, Norman Wisdom), <strong> Five Children and It</strong> is a dull, unmagical adaptation of E Nesbit's 1902 classic. Updated to 1917 and with borrowings from, among other sources, The Railway Children, it centres on the adventures of five kids evacuated to the countryside during the First World War when Zeppelins bomb London and their father is a fighter pilot with the Royal Flying Corps. </p> <p>The children's performances are stilted, the adults are overly jolly, and the special effects are so-so. The best aspect is the comic voice provided by Eddie Izzard for the film's 'It', the grumpy beach fairy who grants the children's wishes. JK Rowling is a great admirer of E Nesbit, but no child who has seen the Harry Potter films is going to be satisfied by this one. </p> <p>For the past 17 years, while making four feature movies, Jim Jarmusch has been shooting nine-minute black-and-white vignettes, minimalist dialogues in which a couple of people sit in cafes drinking coffee and smoking. They've been shown as curtain raisers at festivals (one won the Palme d'Or for best short film at Cannes), but assembled, as 10 of them are here in <strong> Coffee and Cigarettes</strong>, they constitute a meal of hors d'oeuvres. </p> <p>The effect is not cumulative. Four or five are duds. Three, however, in which people appear as versions of themselves, are outstanding - Iggy Pop meeting Tom Waits; Cate Blanchett (in both roles) having a reunion with an envious cousin; Alfred Molina taking tea with Steve Coogan in Hollywood. All three are uneasy encounters between artists aware of their comparative status, wary of being undermined or humiliated. They're well worth seeing, but they'd be best seen one at a time, between programmes on Channel 4 for instance.</p>",

  "<p>After the funeral in April of their best friend Mark Thow, 35-year-old Ivor Robertson and Richard Burnside, who was 36, retired to a pub in Inverness to remember the good times. The dark, smoke-filled bar was already heaving with other players, past and present, from the local amateur football team the three men played for, and from other clubs scattered across the Scottish Highlands. Many of the mourners had been rivals of Mark's on the pitch but friends and drinking partners the minute the full-time whistle sounded.</p> <p>At first, as is often the way with apparently tough Highland men, they necked pints and laughed as if their lives were as carefree as a child's. It's the only coping mechanism they know. So they got drunk and they howled as they recalled memories of Mark. He was some player, they agreed - small but sprightly and full of pep, determination and self-assurance. But he was a referee's nightmare, always questioning decisions and casting doubt on the ref's eyesight or allegiance.</p> <p>After an anecdote, the laughter would gradually die down and someone would say: 'He was just so full of life' or 'He was the biggest prankster going' or 'A real wee joker', and the players would nod in agreement, then slowly shake their heads in disbelief. Eventually, someone raised the unavoidable, but probably unanswerable, question: why? Mark, who had recently turned 40, seemed to have everything to live for: a good job, three children, and another two from a previous marriage, nice house, and a wonderful wife. He was healthy, had a busy social life, a holiday to look forward to, and there was no history of depression or mental ill-health. Mark was not the sort of person you would expect to take a dog's lead, tie it round his neck, loop it over the bathroom door, and hang himself.</p> <p>But on Easter Monday, after taking the family pet, Scooby, for a walk, going to the local shop, arranging to meet a friend for a hair of the dog, then having a shower, that's exactly what he did. Sometime around 1pm on 12 April, Mark Thow decided life was no longer worth living.</p> <p>Just a few minutes after 1pm, his son Jason, who was 14 at the time, burst into the house the way teenagers do, bolted upstairs and found a scene which will haunt him for the rest of his days. He screamed for his mother, who was still outside taking shopping from the car, contacted the emergency services and tried to shield his nine-year-old brother Ryan from the sight in the bathroom. </p> <p>Jason and his mother released Mark. The police, who were there within three minutes, tried to resuscitate him but it was too late.</p> <p>'It was devastating,' says Hugh Mackie, a friend and mentor of Mark's. 'He was a laugh-a-minute kind of person. Nothing ever got him down. I just can't believe he never spoke to anyone about his inner thoughts.'</p> <p>Mark's wife Yvonne does not believe her husband intended to die. 'I knew him better than he knew himself. There's no way on earth he did that on purpose,' she says. Instead, she thinks it was a prank which went tragically wrong.</p> <p>They'd had an argument on Saturday night. He'd spent the weekend drinking. When he slept in and skipped work on Monday morning, Yvonne told him he was a selfish bastard, then she left to take the children for a haircut. She believes Mark heard her car arriving back in the car park and decided to play a joke to scare her, to remind her that she loved him to death even though he'd gone on a bender at the weekend. 'I think he thought it would be like the movies - that it would take 10 minutes, not 10 seconds,' she says. Now, of course, she blames herself.</p> <p>Whether intentional or accidental, Mark's death stunned Inverness, and had a profound effect on his team-mates in the close-knit amateur football fraternity. Mark, Ivor and Richard had played together for Glenalbyn, a local pub side, since 1998, hauling it from the fourth to the first division. Such was their passion for the game that they each played for one or two other teams as well and had done for the past 15 years. But it wasn't just on the pitch that they were friends. They lived within walking distance of each other in Hilton, a housing estate on the outskirts of Inverness, and had known each other since primary school. They were, by all accounts, not angels but characters full of wit and charm and banter.</p> <p>When the talk turned to the nature of Mark's death in the pub after his funeral, Ivor said he could never take his own life. How could anyone do that to their children, their partner, their mum and dad? Richard agreed; he could never commit suicide. Although he was upset about Mark's death, he was also angry with him for what he saw as an ultimately weak and selfish act. He turned to his own father, John, who'd coached Richard and Mark when they played for another local side, and gave him some unexpected words of reassurance.</p> <p>'Dad,' he said. 'I know I've caused you and Mum a lot of problems over the years, but that is one thing you don't have to worry about, because I would never dream of doing that.'</p> <p>His father put a comforting arm around him. Thank God, he thought to himself, because he didn't think he or his wife Edna could cope with losing a child by his own hand. They'd already lost their daughter, Sharon, years earlier from cot death. But the idea of one of their sons choosing death didn't bear thinking about.</p> <p>On Saturday 1 May, less than three weeks after Mark's death, less than three weeks after Ivor Robertson said he could never commit suicide, his partner Pauline returned home with their four-year-old son to find him hanging from a dog's lead behind the bathroom door.</p> <p>He'd spent the previous evening out with friends, telling them how much he was looking forward to going to Parkhead the next day to watch Celtic win the league. </p> <p>'He was just his normal easy-going self,' says Robbie Lowe, a friend and team-mate. 'He didn't seem troubled at all. He seemed very lively.'</p> <p>It is inevitable that in any small community the suicides of two close friends in such a short space of time would spark all kinds of gossip and rumours. Some people began to wonder if Mark and Ivor had been involved in a murky business deal or become mixed up in the city's escalating drugs scene. Others offered more outlandish explanations, suggesting that they must have been brainwashed by a cult or partaken in some bizarre sexual act that had gone too far. But there is no evidence to lend weight to any of these theories. </p> <p>Like Mark, Ivor seemed to have everything to live for: secure job, nice home, good partner, a young son. But unlike Mark, Ivor had suffered bouts of depression. On top of that, the death of his friend had affected him badly. At his funeral, the sense of shock and disbelief was palpable. 'You were looking around wondering who's going to be next,' says Lowe.</p> <p>The Highlands have long had Britain's highest suicide rate, with males here three times more likely to take their lives than their counterparts in London. So far this year, there have been 41 suicides in the region - all but a handful of them young or middle-aged men. The number of attempted suicides has also soared. Over one weekend at the beginning of June, 12 out of 20 emergency admissions at Inverness's Raigmore hospital were overdoses.</p> <p>It was once suggested that the suicide rate was artificially increased by the inclusion of non-residents who travelled north to this beautiful but desolate part of the world to end their lives. This is a factor, but even without counting non-residents, the rate is still disproportionately high. </p> <p>With suicide, the lingering question is always: why? Unfortunately, there is no easy answer. Some experts have suggested the death of the old Highland way of life. Not long ago, men here supported their families as farmers or fishermen while women raised the children. But such traditional industries have all but disappeared and it is often women who support their families, working in seasonal service industries, while men struggle to find employment and spend periods on the dole. But this doesn't fully explain the deaths of Mark or Ivor. Although both had experienced spells of unemployment, they were both in secure jobs.</p> <p>There is also the fact that Highland men are notoriously proud and self-reliant. They would never dream of visiting their GP if they were feeling anxious or lonely. 'I guess it's still seen as a sign of weakness for a man here to talk about emotional stuff or to say I need somebody to give me a helping hand,' says Lowe.</p> <p>Alcohol and drugs are another major factor. Much of Highland life centres on drink, and there is a well-known local saying about man's relationship with the bottle: you've got an alcohol problem only if you're drinking two bottles of whisky a day instead of one. In addition, drugs, despite official denials, are becoming a massive problem in the area. Others say the rate is due to the fact that the use of firearms and hanging, the most common methods of committing suicide in the Highlands, have a higher 'success' rate. The short days, long winters and grim isolation are other possible contributory factors.</p> <p>Compounding the problem in these parts is the fact that there is still a huge stigma attached to suicide, partly because the church still has a relatively strong influence. In centuries past, people who committed suicide were buried at night at a crossroads, under piles of stones, or had stakes driven through their hearts to prevent their unquiet spirits from troubling the rest of us. Attitudes have changed, but in the Highlands the issue is still taboo and the notion that suicidal people are to be feared and hated remains. One woman, who lost her husband in March, was told by a bereavement counsellor that because of the nature of his death it would take between six weeks and 18 months before she would be able to look anyone in the eye. And the local council, when asked earlier this year to give funding to the newly formed Suicide Awareness Group, said it would be unable to help because it did not fulfil the necessary criteria. The letter refusing the request stated that 'Gardens in Bloom' was this year's priority, anyway. </p> <p>'Making Inverness and the Highlands look pretty is deemed more important than trying to prevent more deaths,' says Neil Gillies, who helped set up the new support group. 'The attitude here has always been to avoid talking about suicide. There is a view that if you don't talk about it, it'll go away. There is still a lot of shame and stigma. But we have to challenge that. How many more lives have to be lost before the authorities wake up to the magnitude of the problem?'</p> <p>Richard Burnside, affectionately known as Titch, His Boldness or Tricky Dicky, was struck numb by the deaths of his two close friends. Luckily, he came from a close, well-adjusted family, who rallied round him and encouraged him to talk.</p> <p>His father John, a former psychiatric nurse turned publican, was well known around town and, from his first career, experienced in dealing with people who were depressed or had suicidal tendencies. Father and son were so close that people used to joke that they were joined at the hip. To his mother Edna, the kind of feisty, fun-loving woman born to raise boys, he was the apple of her eye. Every day, he'd phone her at least three times. And they'd often chat for more than an hour.</p> <p>When he was drunk, he got sentimental, apologising to his parents for the trouble he'd caused them and saying he longed for nothing more in life than to have what they had: a soul mate in a rock-solid relationship who was always there for the other. </p> <p>Although Richard, like Mark, had a reputation as a hard-living practical joker - he was almost swept away once when he decided to swim the River Ness dressed as 'The Man in Black', to deliver a box of Milk Tray to the woman in his life - and he'd survived three serious car crashes, he was also introspective. As well as being the family's speechmaker and comedian, he was its sensitive soul, writing poetry as he pondered love, loss and the meaning of life.</p> <p>Richard had always been a big drinker, which had got him into trouble with the police. In addition, he'd had long spells of unemployment and a painful relationship break-up. But to the surprise of some of those closest to him, the death of his two friends initially seemed to spur him into getting his life back on track. After five years of drinking at a dangerous level, he decided to quit. He struggled, but managed six weeks with only the occasional shandy. He got a new, well-paid job in construction; his house increased in value, leaving him debt-free; he booked a holiday in Crete for himself and his eight-year-old daughter Kayleigh; and he reached an agreement with his former partner which enabled him to see Kayleigh whenever he wanted.</p> <p>Richard also asked his father to help him organise a charity football match in memory of Mark and Ivor, and became a crutch for some of the other players who were finding it hard to come to terms with the deaths of their two team-mates. When Michael MacBean, the manager of 'the Glen', said he'd been having suicidal thoughts, it was Richard who talked him out of it. To the outside observer, things had never looked better. 'Isn't Titch doing incredibly well?' everyone said.</p> <p>But he wasn't. He wasn't doing well at all. It was a mirage. The galvanising momentum that had carried him along had taken him as far as it could. He'd hit a wall. The truth of what he was left with was beginning to settle in. For three months, Richard had tried so hard to convince himself and those around him that he could live a good, worthwhile life without alcohol and without his two friends. But on the morning of Tuesday 3 August, he decided he couldn't.</p> <p>Edna Burnside knew something was wrong when she hadn't heard from Richard by lunchtime. She phoned him again and again. Around 10 times, she thinks. Maybe more. Then she texted and left messages. At first, she told herself he must've fallen off the wagon and was lying in bed. When she hadn't heard anything by 6pm, she asked her brother to drop by Richard's place on his way home from work to check on him. His back door was unlocked. The lights and heating were on. The packed lunch he'd made that morning remained untouched in the kitchen. And there he was - hanging from the upstairs landing.</p> <p>What ran through the minds of Edna and John Burnside when they were told the news was something close to nausea mixed with disbelief, despair and deep sorrow. Like Mark and Ivor, Richard left no note, so those left behind have had to fathom their own answers and explanations.</p> <p>'There's no doubt, he'd been examining his soul,' his father told me recently, 'and I think he felt a bit guilty. He'd been good at school but felt he'd lost his way and let people down. And drink was a big problem. He wanted to give up but I don't think he could, and I think he was worried about Kayleigh growing up and seeing that she had a drunk for a father. And, of course, the deaths of Mark and Ivor hit him bad.'</p> <p>Sunday 3 October 2004 was a cold but beautiful autumn day in Inverness. At midday, Richard's daughter Kayleigh and Mark's son Ryan led two teams out on to a pitch for a charity football match in memory of the three friends: Clach FC, the local semi-professional team, versus Friends of Mark Thow, Ivor Robertson and Richard Burnside. Before kick-off, the players stood around the centre circle for two minutes, the silence interrupted only by the sound of birdsong. The Friends side - made up of players from various teams including the Glen (though the team itself has been disbanded), Richard's older brother and Mark's oldest son - was thrashed. But the object wasn't to win. It was to remember three fun-loving team-mates, and to raise funds for suicide awareness and support.</p> <p>In the dark, smoke-filled social club afterwards, hundreds of apparently tough Highland men still necked pints and drams as if there was no tomorrow. But they no longer laughed as if they didn't have a care in the world. Instead, some wiped away tears while others sat in silence, shaking their heads in disbelief.</p>",
  "<p>One of the first signs that things are going awry is when you start to measure your life in song lines. Not in a Chatwin-esque, sub-Aboriginal way, but more in a Leonard Cohen, Radiohead, Nick Drake kind of manner. I wouldn't dismiss this approach out of hand - like every other melancholic, middle-aged man I am an inveterate sucker for poetic gloom - but real darkness needs lifting, not indulging. You have to find some light or go under. The garden is damp and unkempt and reminds me of a basement flat that has not been lived in for a while. If I were a visitor I wouldn't know who gardened here or what they were about. Yet of course I live here - it is my home and it is all my fault, one way or another. Look at it another way. It is like a marriage. We live together, the garden and I, share the same space for a minute or two (there I go again, another line, the temptation for second-hand emotion is overwhelming), but we are clearly not spending enough meaningful time together.</p> <p>But I make myself go outside and look for the good. In the vegetable garden, the artichokes have regrown with the new vigour they show in spring. Although this is a triumph of hope over experience because the frost will cut them down, it is stirring to see. The 'Doyen du Comice' pears are just at the point of picking. I am loath to gather them off the espaliers any sooner than I must - and yet once they drop it is too late. </p> <p>I counsel others to check them all every day but don't do it myself, of course. If only. The late sowing of beetroots worked, and there is now a whole bed of golfball-sized beets with very edible tops. The chicory's all dandy; the radicchio and 'Red Treviso' turning their winter crimson. </p> <p>I am good at chicory. This is not hard, but the knowledge and reminder of it cheers me up. </p> <p>Then on into the damp garden, ravaged by neglect. No, on closer inspection, that is my cast of mind. The eyes form a kinder judgment. A bit weather-blown, perhaps, but mainly just unvisited by me. We are strangers to each other and I resent this very much. </p> <p>You have to do it together, you and the garden. We need each other to make any sense out of it. I see that the comfrey has grown back lustily from its cut-back just a few weeks ago and the lovage and cardoons are brown echoes of their summer selves. But there, solitary and at first hidden, is the best thing I have seen in this garden for weeks and weeks. A solitary quince, pear-shaped, downy and lime green.</p> <p>Just five yards away is another quince tree, bent double with the weight of its fruits, which are much rounder - apples to the other's pear - and smaller. These are good, too - no, fantastic, a gift - but familiarity has bred a little contempt. The other is the first fruit of that tree and I am jubilant, claiming credit where absolutely none is due. These are Cydonia oblonga, not chaenomeles, although the latter will make edible fruit as a by-product of its flowers. But cydonia makes trees, and although the blossom is as good as any chaenomeles imaginable, that is the warm-up act, presaging the real thing that is the fruit.</p> <p>The single quince is 'Vranja', which is the most upright of the four varieties I have been growing. The fruit is very large, but then if a tree has only one fruit to put its energy into, it ought to be a whopper. According to my garden diary, I bought the tree on 6 November 1997, but it only reached this final position in the garden two years ago, which was its third move in five years, so no wonder it had refrained from fruiting until now. But in theory, 'Vranja' is an early cropper and one of the few quinces that can be trained successfully against a wall as a fan shape.</p> <p>The tree laden with fruit is 'Lescovacz'. Two years ago it had 47 fruits, but last year not one, despite an incredible blossoming. Quince blossom is the best of all - a sugar pink that is never sickly. It comes late and stays for too short a time but is always breathtakingly beautiful. This year there must be more than 60 fruits. </p> <p>We still have plenty of the membrillo that I made with the bulk of the crop two years ago, which is a coarse but delicious sweetmeat that is ideal with a smoky cheese, game or added to a gravy. But a little of it goes quite a long way, so maybe I should make marmalade and wine this time, although I have just found another marmelo recipe that involves boiling the fruit in wine and honey rather than a sugar solution, which sounds worth trying. The edible point about quince is that it is aromatically, deliciously sweet but this only reveals itself, in the northern hemisphere at least, when cooked. It also has a great deal of pectin, so jellies easily and therefore can be stored conveniently. This is a kind of alchemy and the tree has always been revered as being magically benign. In fact, eating quince has been in decline ever since cane sugar became popularly available and the idea of preserving fruit became a chore rather than a stored-up treat.</p> <p>My other trees are 'Champion' and 'Portugal'. 'Champion' has a roundish fruit; 'Portugal' has more oblong, irregular pear-shaped fruit, almost orange and very woolly with down, and are early to ripen - if they appear. I see a quote that says it is 'slow to start bearing and a shy cropper'. Shyness is potentially attractive but something in the fruit line would be nice soonish. The down is part of their odd, rather confusing charm, even though to the uninitiated it can look like a virulent mould. Just rub it off before cooking.</p> <p>Growing quinces successfully depends upon rich, wet soil, although Jane Grigson says they do well in 'the driest of upland fields and the hottest of small village gardens' in France. Certainly they need sunshine, but don't gamble on the dry-upland bit. If you have a wet patch of ground they will reward you for it. Order or buy a quince now (it is worth shopping around the net and nurseries for the variety you want) and plant it between now and March. Plant it like any other fruit tree - with care but not reverence, digging a wide, but not too deep hole, loosening the subsoil and adding no organic material below the roots but plenty as a mulch on the surface in a 1m-radius around the tree. It will need staking for its first three years but no special care or pruning again in its life other than keeping it weed-free.</p> <p>Quince trees are self-fertile - so you can have just one and expect it to fruit - and grown on their own rootstock. Pears are almost inevitably grown on quince roots as well. This keeps pears small, whereas on its own roots a pear tree wants to become a large, even magnificent tree, more like a full-grown ash or beech than a back-garden bush. Quince tames and reduces it with three possible measures of quince-vigour 'A', 'B' or 'C'. A few pear varieties, such as 'Williams' Bon Chr\u00e9tien', are incompatible with quince and have to have an intermediary graft or 'interstock' to connect the rootstock with the scion which is compatible with both quince and pear. This is called 'double-worked' and makes the tree more expensive, as it adds a year on to its nursery life. </p> <p>On its own roots, quince is sprawly and gangly and it is a waste of time trying to clip or prune it to your preconceived ideas of beauty. Go with it. Be astonished at the blossom. </p> <p>Be unreasonably proud of the fruit. Drink in the incredible fragrance with which a single quince can seduce a room and feast on its pomaded sweetness. It will, I promise, brighten your northern sky.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:monty.don@observer.co.uk\">monty.don@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Dusk in Kabul, and the sky is turning purple over the hills that rim the horizon around the city. Fluorescent lights flare green and red above a crowd and a stage. In the photograph, the crowd is fluid, its movement blurred by the long exposure. What the camera cannot capture is the wonderful, ethereal sounds of Farhad Darya, the legendary Afghan musician who had returned from exile in Canada to perform for the first time for years at the national stadium in Kabul this May.</p> <p>Six years before, I had sat on the stadium's concrete steps on a Friday afternoon. It was a pleasant summer's day, a weak sun lit the grey terraces, and the sky was the washed-out, eggshell blue peculiar to Kabul. Hawkers moved among listless spectators. I watched as doctors amputated the hands of two thieves. Then a man was made to squat by the penalty spot and was shot in the head. Once the blood and brains had been cleared away, there was a football match between teams from Kabul and the eastern city of Jalalabad. </p> <p>In the winter of 2000 I was back in the stadium. This time, a woman was executed. She had been convicted of battering her husband to death with a hammer, a crime that I remember thinking would meet with a similar punishment in many countries in the world, including the US. She crouched in her blue burqa, its fringe tugged by the breeze, looking over her shoulder like a nervous child. I remember hearing the long metallic scrape of the bolt on the executioner's AK47 being drawn back, clearly audible in the hush, and I can remember the three rounds that rang out, the dust that kicked up as the first two travelled through the woman's head, and then the fragments of skull that flew forward. </p> <p>Those days are gone. Two weeks ago Afghans voted in a presidential election, pretty much the only more or less free and fair poll ever held in the country. Holding the election was largely symbolic, but wonderful to see nonetheless. Most people voted on traditional lines - for whoever their village headman or husband or father determined. But at least it was an election. </p> <p>There are no longer executions in Kabul stadium. And many of the seemingly extraordinary restrictions the Taliban imposed on the capital have gone, present only in an odd sort of reverse image, like a photographic negative, when people do what was previously banned.</p> <p>Kabul has been transformed since the days when the Taliban were in control. In those days, traffic was minimal. A few old Soviet-built Volgas or imported Toyota Corollas bounced over the pitted streets. There was one half-decent restaurant where huge piles of steaming pulau and kebabs were served and senior Taliban officials sat on long greasy cushions with their catamites and their automatic weapons beside them. There was one hotel with six functioning rooms. The polytechnic was a minefield. At night, the intermittent electricity flickered on and off in a few favoured sections of the city. The rest was left in chill darkness.</p> <p>In contrast to today's bars, restaurants and thriving expat social scene, the international presence in the city was limited to a few NGOs, the UN, a handful of reporters and an increasing number of Arab, Pakistani or Central Asian militants. Often I was the only Western journalist in the country. Afghanistan was a decrepit global cul-de-sac. </p> <p>The Taliban's rule in Kabul, from 1996 to 2001, is now generally considered the epitome of fundamentalist Muslim repression. But the Taliban regime and its seemingly irrational social regulations can be better understood if seen in the context of Afghanistan in the mid- to late Nineties.</p> <p>For all their failings, the Taliban brought security to many areas where there was none. Impositions that were shocking in the cities were not impositions at all in the vast majority of Afghanistan. In the dusty hill villages of Paktia or Oruzgan province, of Ghor or Faryab, women had never gone to school or travelled without a burqa. Nor was the ban on televisions much of an issue. There weren't any.</p> <p>The Taliban's security meant that when, crippled by an enormous hangover, I left a wallet containing my passport and $1,500 on a bus, it was returned intact. It meant you could hail a cab and go virtually anywhere, provided you took the precaution of first checking in with the local warlord or Taliban official (often the same person). I slept in villages, military bases, the occasional fly-blown hotel, or in chai khannas, the roadside inns where tea and food (chai and khanna) are served to travellers. In one, just outside the town of Qalat on the road between Kabul and Kandahar, I woke at dawn to find everyone, guests and staff, lined up in the dust of the road for dawn prayers. I lay wrapped in blankets and watched them. It was an insight into the depth of local piety. Imagine a Travelodge on the M4 emptying into the car park for prayers at 4am. This was not fundamentalism or extremism. It was simply an expression of a faith that articulates every part of life. It was also an example of something that is often forgotten in analyses of the Taliban and of Afghanistan: the profound difference between Kabul and the rest of the country. </p> <p>No one in the West took much notice of the Taliban until they arrived in the capital and began imposing their infamous bans - on weather forecasting, representations of living things, leather jackets and 'Western hairstyles', pigeon racing, kite flying and most other forms of entertainment. Yet the reasoning behind this extreme rigour deserves understanding and even, controversial though it may be to say so, a degree of sympathy.</p> <p>Many Taliban had seen their families destroyed, their fathers killed, their fields deliberately despoiled, their culture splintered and their homeland sucked into a welter of violence. And if they hadn't witnessed it themselves, they had been told during their childhood in their stinking, seething refugee camps in Pakistan about the devastation wrought by the war with the Soviets in the Eighties. The attraction of the clear certainties of a rigorous interpretation of Islam to those steeped in such chaos is easy to comprehend. They believed that all that had gone wrong in their lives could be attributed to modernity, to newness, to change. They wanted a revolution in the original sense of the word, a turning back of the clock. There was a blackness, a trauma, at the heart of the Taliban movement. Outside the Ministry of Religious Affairs, I once saw a painted slogan: 'Every breath is a breath closer to death.' A year later it had been replaced with: 'Throw reason to the dogs. It stinks of corruption.'</p> <p>There was a perversely logical rationale behind the bans. The Taliban imagined the life they had lost as an idealised version of rural tribal society. That life, with its supposed purity and social justice, could be enjoyed once more if everybody followed the Shariat, the corpus of Islamic law, particularly where it intersected with local traditions that were threatened by change. And if people didn't want to, then for the greater good of all, they needed to be forced to. </p> <p>Thus all the injunctions: women could not go out without a close relative (effectively preventing them from working), men had to wear beards of a specific length, anything that detracted from prayer or religious observance had to be shunned. Secularism, cosmopolitanism, gender equality (and rule by non-Pashtuns) all had come from Kabul. And while the provinces had suffered terribly during the Soviet war, Kabul had done quite well, with big aid programmes, building schemes, cafes and cinemas, girls in miniskirts, imported films. The city dwellers were seen as collaborators. Kabul, to the rural Taliban, was Babylon and its women were the whores. And the Taliban behaved accordingly. </p> <p>As the years of their rule progressed, and their international isolation deepened, the Taliban drew closer to the Gulf-based strands of Islam followed by men like Osama bin Laden. Even as late as 1998 the Taliban were almost astonishingly simplistic. Bored, waiting for an interview with the minister for religious affairs, I once asked his guards, a detachment of religious police charged with enforcing the minister's harsh edicts, if I could join them. They looked me up and down and then conferred. Of course, they said, if I really wanted to. There followed another debate. One came over and shyly asked if I was a Muslim. No, I told him and asked if that was a problem. He looked grave and spoke to his colleagues again. A minute later he returned, all smiles. No problem, he told me, if I came with them to the mosque for dawn prayers the next day I could convert and there would be no trouble at all. </p> <p>There were, of course, far darker elements to the Taliban's regime. Arbitrary beatings were regularly meted out. Ethnic minorities, especially the Hazaras from the centre and west of the country, were cleansed from much of the city. The plains to the north were effectively razed. Once they had been the bread basket for the capital, spotted with beautiful villages set among orchards and vineyards. By the time of the war of 2001 they were wastelands, populated by thin, haunted, hunted people. </p> <p>Things are better now, as these photographs reflect. At least, they are in Kabul. Women are still dying without medical attention because their menfolk refuse to take them to hospital, but large numbers of girls are educated, there are women police officers, men can have their beards cut, the university is full, the mines have been cleared from the polytechnic, there are international flights to destinations throughout Europe and Asia from the city airport, cinemas have reopened to show the hugely popular Bollywood musicals (and Western pornography). Though in most of Afghanistan the misogyny and repression of centuries past continues almost unaltered, this is a start at least. </p> <p>The shame is that the attention of the world is now drifting elsewhere. Last November, I wandered through the hospital in Kandahar, the main city in southeastern Afghanistan. The sound of steady sobbing echoed through empty rooms. In one wing I found children dying of malnutrition. </p> <p>A handwritten sign stuck up in a corner told me I had found the 'therapoetic feeding centre'. The bathos was terrible. Two years after their country had been invaded by the world's richest and most powerful state, five-year-olds were starving to death. </p> <p>A few days later I drove out to the village of Sangesar, where the Taliban had been founded 10 years ago. I spoke to the locals gathered for Friday prayers at the mosque where Mullah Omar, the reclusive one-eyed cleric who led the movement, once preached. Did they want the Taliban back, I asked. No, they said. They wanted a well. </p> <p>During Taliban times there was a man who rode an old Russian motorbike around a rickety wooden 'wall of death' in Ariana Square in the centre of Kabul. He rarely drew much of a crowd and it was hazardous work. The bike was barely fast enough to maintain the momentum to keep him from crashing to the floor. I saw him a few times. I wonder what happened to him. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Afghanaid is an independent UK-based charity that has worked alongside Afghan communities for two decades.

I'm going and I want some money' and that was it. I'll never forget saying to my wife: 'You can't do that; I love you.' She just said: 'Get a life - people do it all the time.' That was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, but it never made me lose my faith in women.</p> <p>We've all got a feminine side, but I was told that we've all got a bit of a gay side, too. So I thought: 'All right, I'm going to be gay.' I was walking down the street trying to look at men, but I just like women too much.</p> <p>I've got 10 honorary doctorates and a hospital ward named after me in Ealing. These honours aren't political - they're separate from the monarchy and they're about achieving in the community. Does anyone call me Dr Zephaniah? Yes, the police. I make them. </p> <p>I'm a great sprinter but I'm not a great jogger. It doesn't matter how long I've run - for the last 100m, I'll still give a good burst.</p> <p>Even if I drink a little bit, I get out of control and tell stupid sexist jokes. It's just not me, so I don't drink. When I was 15 I was at a party and I got drunk and I don't remember any of it. Everybody told me I had a row with the DJ and was dancing with every woman in the place, and I hated that idea. </p> <p>I'm a vegan because I just love animals. I wouldn't sit on a chair made of leather.</p> <p>The worst thing about being in prison is waking up. Have you ever been in a plane or a car and you go to get up and you've got your seatbelt on? When you're in prison you dream, and when you dream you're free, and it feels real. When you wake up, it's like that - it just jars you. </p> <p>I've got a great big sauna. It's not a room, it's actually another building in my yard. I got it shipped over from Finland. It's not as grand as it sounds, but it's really nice. </p> <p>Everyone that sees it goes: 'Wow!'</p> <p>My heroes are teachers and nurses.</p> <p>I believe that you've got to break the law at least once a day. Have I broken it today? No, I probably will about lunchtime - stand in the corner and take out my penis or something. A little token gesture.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Gangsta Rap, by Benjamin Zephaniah (Bloomsbury), is out now, price \u00a35.99 Interview Ben Mitchell Photograph Neil Massey</p>",
  "<p>Adam Curtis likes a challenge. Eighteen months ago he proposed a new series of documentary films for the BBC. The films, he explained to his bosses, would be about the philosophical ideas behind conservatism. As a pitch, he concedes, it was 'about the dullest of all subjects you can imagine'. In these days of docusoaps and reality stunts it says just about everything you need to know about Curtis's brilliance as a filmmaker that he was commissioned to make the series at all. The BBC's faith has been more than rewarded, however, by The Power of Nightmares , the first part of which went out on Wednesday. </p> <p>Curtis's original idea led him in typically unexpected directions. In particular, to developing a fearful symmetry between American neoconservative thought and Islamic fundamentalism. In looking back he discovered that the progenitors of each of these movements - the American political philosopher Leo Strauss, and the Egyptian revolutionary Sayyid Qutb - had been responding to similar observations. They had both been at American universities just after the Second World War - Strauss as a professor, Qutb as a student - and what they had seen there had convinced them that within American prosperity lay the seeds of its moral destruction. </p> <p>'Everyone was thinking Truman's America is great and these two completely obscure figures were looking at it, in 1949, and thinking no, there is something wrong with this; they were both pessimists. We now live in a world that is shaped partly by the results of their thinking.' </p> <p>From this beginning, Curtis went on to deconstruct the ways in which the governments of America and Britain in particular had seized upon fear as a way of connecting with their population, and presents the war on terror as a product of this thinking. 'What I am saying,' he says, 'is that I don't think al-Qaeda exists in the way that we have been asked to understand it. There are awful atrocities, of course, and there is militant Islamic fundamentalism. But the idea of a global network of terror run by Osama bin Laden, unique in its threat, which we have been told about for three years now is, I believe, a myth. I have backed this belief up with ideas that I think show the reasons why this myth has been created.' </p> <p>To understand Curtis's methods in presenting these arguments you have to understand a little of his background. Now 50, he set out teaching politics at Oxford, but got bored with the isolation of that. He decided to work instead in TV and got his first job on Esther Rantzen's That's Life . He found dogs that could sing, researched investigative segments. Along the way he learned a lot about comic timing and the ways an audience might be engaged by issues. 'The best lesson that Esther taught me was that people who think they are funny rarely are,' he says. </p> <p>When he got to make his own documentaries on more serious subjects, he attempted to integrate some of this training with the BBC tradition of documentary-making inspired by his hero James Mossman. His first successful attempt at this was The Road to Terror, a film which intercut footage from the Iranian revolution with material from movies about the French revolution, and with incongruous music. Alan Yentob, who had just become BBC2 controller, loved the playfulness of this, and encouraged Curtis to apply his sense of mischief to the weightiest of subjects, mixing high seriousness and impeccable journalism with an extreme lightness of touch. </p> <p>If there has been a theme in Curtis's work since, it has been to look at how different elites have tried to impose an ideology on their times, and the tragi-comic consequences of those attempts. In his series Pandora's Box he examined the apocalyptic political fallout of nuclear science. In The Mayfair Set , he looked at how buccaneer capitalists were allowed to shape the climate of the Thatcher years. And in The Century of the Self he traced the ways in which Freud had been used to generate the triumph of Western consumerism. </p> <p>The fun and surprise of his films is the footage that he uncovers to support his mesmerising essays. The first part of the current series featured not only pertinent clips from Gunsmoke, but also bravura material from Donald Rumsfeld's days as Defence Secretary in the Seventies, talking up the Soviet threat, just as he now talks up the unprecedented danger of bin Laden's terror networks. Curtis has a remarkable feel for the serendipity of such moments, and an obsessive skill in locating them. 'That kind of footage shows just how dull I can be,' he admits, a little glumly. 'The BBC has an archive of all these tapes where they have just dumped all the news items they have ever shown. One tape for every three months. So what you get is this odd collage, an accidental treasure trove. You sit in a darkened room, watch all these little news moments, and look for connections.' </p> <p>He likes to think his approach to documentary shares something with the method of a 19th-century novelist. 'You look at Bleak House, say, and Dickens throws 10 strands of news stories together and sees where they lead him. I love the idea of that.' </p> <p>In this way, led partly by curiosity and chance, Curtis leaves his films open to possibility. 'Journalism traditionally is done in specialisms,' he says, 'but the interesting thing in the modern world is that different things impinge on each other in unexpected ways.' By cutting at almost subliminal speed between news footage and pop cultural references, academic interviews and fragments of film noir, Curtis's films recreate exactly that sense of juxtaposition and seem close to the way we experience the world. </p> <p>Thus his history of Islamic fundamentalism begins with an observation Sayyid Qutb made while at a dance in America in 1949, watching 'decadent' young Americans smooch. The song that was playing was 'Baby, it's Cold Outside'. 'That song,' says Curtis, 'was really what made me want to make the film. It was a tune which in itself was responding to postwar anxieties. And Qutb watches people dance to that song and he has these thoughts about the moral emptiness of capitalism. The beginning of thoughts about how he might change the world.' That, Curtis thought, is like the start of a novel. </p> <p>His own journey from that point was based on two specific kinds of faith. First in the power of narrative, of one extraordinary thing leading to another. And second in the intellectual curiosity of his viewers. 'If you can get from a church dance in 1949, to the assassination of President Sadat within an hour, and you fill in a lot of the gaps between, then I think people will watch that.' </p> <p>Most of all he remains firm in his unfashionable belief that our world is shaped by big ideas. 'I found out that Sayyid Qutb and Leo Strauss had both deduced from Nietzsche the way that liberal society was heading: towards nihilism. The real basis of my films is that Nietzsche's ideas have shaped the world we live in, but in totally unpredictable ways.' Imagine trying to sell that to the marketing people. </p> <p>At the heart of his argument is the proposal that Blair and Bush have, deliberately or not, exaggerated the current danger to give themselves a new connection to their voters. 'The war between good and evil gives them a purpose. Blair has a temperamental sense of imagining the worst. What the films begin to show, though, is that they are protecting us against a myth.' </p> <p>His third film in particular, he acknowledges, may expose Curtis to similar charges of naivety, in its assertion that al-Qaeda, as a global terror network, is a convenient political illusion. He has a ready response to politicians and spooks who may suggest he does not know the half of it. 'If they want our trust, they should trust us in return. Stop whispering to friendly journalists about this unknown terror, tell us the basis of your fear. Because I have looked for it, and I can't find it. If you examine the figures, they have not found any evidence of a hidden network in three years. They have managed to convict three people by association with Islamist groups. The majority of people who have been arrested under the new laws in that period are Irish terrorists.' </p> <p>In making this case, Curtis has produced the most provocative piece of television that the BBC has shown since the Hutton inquiry. He says that he sees at close quarters how 'BBC people are terrified often of doing politics'. But also how actually that seems to be flying in the face of what people want. 'Politics are actually \"cool\" right now; the trick is to try to do them in a new way. People come into TV at 25 or so, they are interested in politics, but they are told they have to do things like they were done 20 years ago, boring graphics, talking heads. It is as if nobody has ever seen The Day Today .' </p> <p>Curtis gave a lecture to the BBC bosses once; Greg Dyke called him in to address his 'central command unit'. What he argued was that as a corporation they had stopped explaining things. 'Events come at us in emotional waves and we let that happen.' Worse, he believes, that method has also started to be applied to the past. 'You go back to the Brighton Bomb, and you make it a human interest story. You take away the fact that this is actually part of a dispute over particular ideas and the result of particular politics.' </p> <p>News, he believes, must be run by people who can maintain a strict sense of questioning distance. 'If you report things emotionally it immediately depoliticises them. No one gets judged, little gets fully understood.' </p> <p>Still Curtis is under no illusion that he is moving against a powerful prevailing culture. 'They pulled some of the trails for my series out of respect for the family of Kenneth Bigley,' he says. 'What kind of madness is that? If a bomb went off here tomorrow, I have no doubt they would pull the series itself. They have discussed that. My rational argument would be immediately that this does not defeat my point in any way. There are of course bad people in the world who have bombs. But that does not justify the scale of the fear that currently possesses people. We have been prepared by politicians and the media to expect nightmares, even to need them. If nothing else we need to get a grip.' </p> <p>As good a place as any to start, in this respect, is with the second film in Curtis's series, on BBC2 this Wednesday.</p>",
  "<p>Australia overcame a shaky first half and testing conditions to record the first victory in the Tri-Nations series. In an intense but error-strewn contest played in driving rain, the Kangeroos, led magnificently by their captain Darren Lockyer, turned on the class in the second half to run out comfortable winners. </p> <p>These two teams had fought out a bruising 16-16 draw in Auckland just seven days ago and there was no shortage of commitment in front of a sell out crowd. But the Australians showed just what a world-class team they are by scoring four tries without reply in the second half. </p> <p>Yet in the first 40 minutes New Zealand more than matched them. They got off to a flyer with a try from Brent Webb after just two minutes and although Craig Fitzgibbon's two goals plus Luke Rooney's touchdown gave Australia an 8-4 lead, a typically blockbusting effort from Lesley Vainikolo levelled things up before Vinnie Anderson put them ahead with a try just before half-time. </p> <p>The Kangeroos, who had made too many errors and dropped too much ball, were staring defeat in the face. 'We lost our way and made a lot of errors,' admitted their coach Wayne Bennett. 'We were pretty flat but we found something in the second half.' </p> <p>That something came in the shape of Lockyer, who combined brilliantly with his scrum-half Craig Gower to change the course of the game. Less than 90 seconds into the half, Gower fed Lockyer and the stand-off threw a dummy before sweeping past Logan Swann for a try. Minutes later, a series of slick passes resulted in Willie Tonga powering over, then Shaun Berrigan followed up a neat grubber kick from Gower for the another and Australia were on their way to a victory which Petero Civoniceva sealed with a final touchdown. </p> <p>'We had to hold on to the football a little better,' said Lockyer, 'and we did that. We also started to make a few holes around the rucks.' The good news for Great Britain, who face Australia in their first Tri-Nations game at the City of Manchester Stadium on Saturday, is that Lockyer came off after 60 minutes and is doubtful for that match. </p> <p>He damaged his ribs in April and they have continued to bother him throughout the season. 'The ribs are sore,' he said. 'I aggravated them tonight and probably stirred some scar tissue up. They are not too bad but in a worst-case scenario I'll miss next week.' </p> <p>Daniel Anderson, coach to New Zealand, was only too aware of what cost his side the game. 'Ball control. You have to have equal position and possession - that is the only way to beat the Australians. In the second half we coughed up too much pill [ball]. They made us pay for our errors pretty heavily.' </p> <p>Both coaches agreed that taking the game to Loftus Road had been a huge success. 'We enjoyed the support,' said Anderson, while Bennett admitted to getting goosebumps when he stepped onto the pitch. Which all adds up to a great start for this inaugural series. </p> <p> <strong> AUSTRALIA:</strong> Minichiello; Rooney, Berrigan, Tonga, Sing; Lockyer, Gower; Webcke, Buderus, Ryles, Fitzgibbon, Hindmarsh, Carroll. <strong> Subs used:</strong> Wing, Civoniceva, Mason, Timmins. </p> <p><strong> NEW ZEALAND: </strong> Webb; Meli, Vagana, Whatuira, Vainikolo; V Anderson, Leuluai; J Cayless, L Anderson, N Cayless, Swann, Wiki, Williams. <strong> Subs used:</strong> Paul, Asotasi, Rauhihi, Kidwell. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> R Smith (Great Britain).</p>",
  "<p><strong> Little Britain </strong> BBC3 </p> <p><strong>Wife Swap International</strong> C4 </p> <p><strong> The Power of Nightmares</strong> BBC2 </p> <p>Last week, during an idle session with the remote control, I came across Richard and Judy discussing their favourite scenes from <strong> Little Britain</strong>. From languishing in a TV trance that we channel-surfers refer to as 'the zone', I was suddenly thrown into that state of metaphysical dislocation, under which many of us labour with increasing regularity, whereby you're not sure if what you're seeing is 'real' or some kind of joke at reality's expense. </p> <p>I accept, of course, that if you're looking for a firm grip on reality, then Richard and Judy are not necessarily the most reliable company to keep. A pair of postmodern fundamentalists, they long ago smashed the vital distinction between human tragedy and cooking recipes. Nevertheless, there was something about this celebration of a supposed cult comedy that, even by the flexible standards of daytime TV, seemed more than a little odd. </p> <p>Here were Richard and Judy, the middle-aged team whose banal English homeliness has made them into household names, praising a programme that takes a juvenile delight in savaging everything that is banal, homely and English, not to mention Welsh. Have I missed something? </p> <p>The answer, if I'm honest, is pretty much the whole of the Bafta-winning first series of Little Britain. I'm no fan of the comic school of surreal vulgarity, the kind of scatology in drag that had many people raving over The League of Gentlemen . As much of the humour rests on shock appeal, unless you're a male student recently returned from the pub, very soon nothing surprises and therefore nothing amuses. But I'm afraid I didn't get as far as very soon. </p> <p>So to the buckets of vomit and phlegm that made up the first episode of the second series of Little Britain , I came fresh, as it were, if not exactly eager. For David Walliams and Matt Lucas, the co-writers and co-performers, the problem seemed to be the reverse: they were eager but some way from fresh. </p> <p>All comedy is derivative - it's just that some have the wit to disguise it. In Little Britain, Monty Python, The Young Ones and The Fast Show look less like recognised influences than regurgitated ingredients dumped in a slightly blunt comic blender. The result is a collection of outlandish, state-of-the-nation sketches, vivid in colour but low on taste. </p> <p>Yet for all their debts to people like Terry Jones and Paul Whitehouse, Walliams and Lucas do not lack invention. Their targets may be the usual suspects - the small-minded and the suburban - but they also display an ambivalent affection for Middle England cheese. Hence Nigel Havers and Vanessa Feltz turn up as guest stars, only to be set upon by a gay lech, in Havers's case, while Feltz is spat on by a self-obsessed weight-loss instructor. (Is this the going price of credibility for matinee lotharios and daytime queens, and if so, was Judy's appreciation really a coded audition?) </p> <p>The most successful creation and, incidentally, Judy's favourite, is Lucas's Dafydd Thomas, a camp Welsh village boy constantly looking to assert his homosexuality in every way short of having homosexual sex. The joke is that he's terrified of gays. </p> <p>It's a nice conceit, but Lucas and Walliams don't seem to know where to take it, other than too far. Comedi ans are free to go in any direction, but they tend to have difficulty exiting a sketch. Monty Python used to end by having an animated foot stamp on the action, while The Fast Show relied on its pace to escape to the next scene, but like novice gamblers, Lucas and Walliams haven't learnt yet to get out while they're ahead. </p> <p>It's not unfunny when Dafydd's mother asks if he's had any 'arse action' and it's less unfunny when she says she knows of a potential mate who's 'mad for cock', but by the time they get on to 'watersports', the sketch turns into what Terry-Thomas used to call a shower. Sometimes in comedy, as in life, it's silence that is golden. </p> <p>That's not a sentiment with which Sharon from <strong> Wife Swap International </strong> would sympathise. She has to say what's on her mind, she confessed, because 'that's the way I am'. Like a lot of people who are that way, she didn't have much time for the ways of others, in particular for those of the German family with whom she was staying. </p> <p>Wearing a 'Get Your Kit Off' T-shirt and saying things like: 'I'm crapping my pants', Sharon could easily have been one of Matt Lucas's drag characters. We hate the Germans, she informed us, and they hate us. This was news to the Germans, as indeed were such culinary delights as oven chips with pasta rolls. But in this marital exchange, Sharon was impatient to enrich her adopted family with the benefit of her cultural wisdom. Or, as she put it: 'Make 'em all fink.' </p> <p> Wife Swap in its original domestic form was never easy to watch, which is paradoxically what made it so compelling. All the crude and subtle rules and rituals of Britain's social structure were painfully fascinating to behold when viewed through the eyes of couples from contrasting back grounds. But the pain was dulled by the knowledge that we were all British together in our ridiculous mundanities and eccentricities. </p> <p> Wife Swap International offers no such relief. We see someone like Sharon, proud of her insularity and ignorance, and it's like finding yourself sitting next to the crass English family on a foreign holiday: you want to hide your passport and speak in another language. But, of course, you can't because you're English, which is the other problem with this series. The foreign family has to speak English, something that the English - 'the men hasn't gotta do nuffin' - were under no obligation to do. </p> <p>But as things turned out, everyone gained: the hausfrau with whom Sharon swapped learnt that there was more to life than making your husband's meals and your children's beds. Sharon learned that it is possible to eat and not watch TV at the same time. And we learned that some things should remain national secrets. </p> <p>Leo Strauss was a believer in national secrets. He was the political philosopher from the University of Chicago who, through his work in the Fifties and Sixties, is now seen as the founder and spiritual leader of the neoconservative movement in America. </p> <p>In <strong> The Power of Nightmares</strong>, Adam Curtis had the inspired idea of juxtaposing Strauss with Sayyid Qutb, the Egyptian who, in the same period, propagated the anti-Western arguments that have guided such influential jihadists as the Ayatollah Khomeini and Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>Curtis, who made a brilliantly provocative series on the Freud family's impact on the 20th century, is not afraid of big or unwieldy ideas, and in the first of this three-part series, he gave new intellectual life to the slightly stale argument that the neoconservatives and Islamic militants have more in common than either would like to admit. </p> <p>There were no cheap Michael Moore-style jibes or accusations in this coolly impressive film. Instead, through his trademark assemblage of amazing archival footage and diligent pursuit of the key interviewees, Curtis presented the case that both the neocons and Islamists saw liberal society's belief in individual freedom as the enemy. </p> <p>According to Curtis, both Strauss and Qutb told their followers that freedom of the individual was an illusion that led to social disintegration and chaos. Indeed, that the very notion of such freedom was a false consciousness. Curtis claims that Strauss and Qutb spoke of a greater reality that only the chosen disciples could divine (those of a conspiratorial mindset may be interested to note that The Matrix was screening simultaneously on Five). As if to confirm this point, neocon Richard Pipes tells Curtis that the absence of proof of a thing's existence can be evidence of the fact that it is actually there. Spooky. </p> <p>All the same, Curtis appears to have concentrated, at least in the first episode, a little too much on similarities of the neocons and jihadists at the expense of noting crucial differences. It was a temptation that he failed to resist in his Freud series, The Century of the Self, wherein he implied that the differences between totalitarian and consumer societies were essentially illusory. </p> <p>Here, he conflates the neocons' antipathy towards permissiveness with an anti-libertarian stance, neglecting the critical questions of individual responsibility and shared morality. He also seems to be saying, don't believe in either conspiracy because they are both fiction. Rather, it's the conspiracy to disseminate these conspiracies that's real. I have to admit to certain ontological problems with this outlook, not helped by the claims and counter-claims of the various agencies which were represented in a complex retelling of American secret service history. In short, it was that old Richard and Judy syndrome: I couldn't be sure I could believe what I was seeing. The difference, in this case, is that it was still well worth watching. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kathryn Flett is away</p>",
  "<p>League clubs must salivate over the prospect of a visit from Inverness, the thought of another victory irresistible.</p> <p>But Kilmarnock discovered that even the league's bottom club have enough spirit to preclude the mental banking of three points.</p> <p>Having led through Stevie Murray then, after Barry Wilson equalised, through Gordon Greer, Kilmarnock should have had their discomfort considerably eased by referee Craig Mackay's scandalous decision to dismiss the Caley defender Stuart McCaffrey.</p> <p>Even with this handicap, incurred just six minutes into the second half, the visitors managed to take some profit from a home team who were generally unconvincing. Substitute Liam Fox's low drive into the far corner from the right side of the area was the least that John Robertson's side deserved for their efforts.</p> <p>Thistle's quest for victories begins, perforce, with the more sensible priority of avoiding defeat. Not blessed with high-level creativity in midfield and attack, the Highlanders, especially away from home, invariably demonstrate a practical recognition of their own limitations.</p> <p>Given this strategy, it can be a dilemma for them when they concede as early as they did here. Abandonment of their containment policy - five strung across midfield, with Graham Bayne the solitary striker - in the cause of retrieval is a risky departure from established ritual.</p> <p>On this occasion, their enforced aggressiveness was sufficient to bring relief through Wilson's equaliser and, ultimately, that second leveller from Fox. That they are generally short of the standard and experience required of their new status was hinted at by the remarkable miscalculation from goalkeeper Mark Brown that made such a contribution to Murray's goal.</p> <p>The little winger received a short pass from Craig Dargo then, having burrowed towards the left side of the area, seemed to be trying the impossible by shooting from the angle. But the ball, low towards Brown's right-hand corner, somehow squeezed under the goalkeeper's arms.</p> <p>The home defence was no more distinguished when they allowed the equaliser. A short corner on the left to Wilson allowed him to move into the box untracked. His driven cross-cum-shot into the group of players converging around the goalmouth was clearly designed for the kind of deflection - from either friend or foe - that it duly took before crossing the goalline.</p> <p>There was nothing fortunate about the execution from Greer that restored the advantage. Danny Invincibile's run down the right brought a cutback to Kris Boyd, whose drive was blocked. The ball came out to Greer and, from 20 yards, his drop-volley was perfectly controlled, the ball hurtling far to the right of Brown.</p> <p>That setback was complemented by the injudiciousness of referee Mackay. There were two powerful arguments against the decision to issue a red card to McCaffrey. The first was that the alleged foul appeared, at worst, to be accidental, as he clearly had his eye on the ball as Dargo, after minimal contact, fell.</p> <p>The second was that the incident occurred more than 40 yards from goal, leaving Dargo with a long way to run - with the ball at his feet - before he would enjoy what could reasonably be termed a clear scoring opportunity. It was hardly a surprise that Robertson, the Thistle coach, should be so animated in his protest to the fourth official, with the referee ultimately summoned to issue a reprimand.</p> <p>Good days are hard enough to find for Inverness without them being further damaged by questionable refereeing.</p>",
  "<p>Great Britain coach Brian Noble will be hoping that Australia and New Zealand have knocked the living daylights out of each other in the two matches they've played over the past eight days. Noble and his squad have been warm-weather training in Spain, but things will be decidedly hotter when they face the Kangaroos in their opening game of the Tri Nations series at the City Of Manchester Stadium on Saturday. </p> <p>But whatever the state of the men who take to the field in the green-and-gold jerseys no one will be underestimating them. Twelve months ago Australia came for a three-Test series with what many felt to be the weakest touring squad in years, yet they recorded their first three-nil whitewash since 1986. A sobering thought as Noble looks to fashion a side capable of beating them. </p> <p>There will be no shortage of passion from the Bradford coach, but the squad he's picked represents something of a gamble. To begin with, there's only one genuine scrum-half in the squad, Sean Long of St Helens. Long has played just two games in four months since being suspended for his part in a betting scandal and is currently recovering from an operation on his foot. </p> <p>Long's co-accused, centre Martin Gleeson, hasn't played at all since June and he is also named in the squad. Brian Carney, the one natural wing in the party has played just 24 minutes of rugby since 3 September thanks to his hamstring injury. </p> <p>Another risky choice is Iestyn Harris, who has just 13 matches under his belt since returning from rugby union. The general view seemed to be that Harris desperately needed a rest after playing non-stop rugby for 12 months, but he is a genuine talent and Noble seems to think it's a risk worth taking. On the plus side, the inclusion of Leeds stand-off Danny McGuire is a cause for optimism. </p> <p>The Australians may be battered and bruised after their two games, but that will be nothing new for these players. The Kangaroos will be finely tuned as a unit, whereas it is 12 months since Great Britain fielded a side. </p> <p>Australia will be led by \u00e7 of the Brisbane Broncos, who has moved from full-back to stand-off with alarming ease. Full-back Anthony Minichiello is an exciting runner and there is no shortage of beef up front including the Brisbane props Shane Webcke and Petero Civoniceva. </p> <p> <strong> INDEED, IT IS </strong> up front where Great Britain must look to dominate if they are to have any chance of winning. Hopefully Adrian Morley can control the aggression that has made him one of the world's best props. Stuart Fielden isn't far behind him, and Andy Farrell's conversion from back-row forward to ball-playing prop could give Great Britain an interesting option. </p> <p>Noble is likely to start the game with Paul Sculthorpe at stand-off to get through what is likely to be a ferocious opening 20 minutes. The introduction of Harris and McGuire later in the game will be one of the key elements of this intriguing contest. The elusiveness and pace of both players harks back to an earlier generation when top-class British half-backs were the key to winning Tests against the Aussies. Provided they have the platform, it could be a return to the good old days.</p>",
  "<p>Gloucester lacked for little against Stade Fran\u00e7ais, but what little they did lack cost them dear in this opening Pool 6 encounter. The home side were without nine front-line squad members, but still managed to field a side that included 11 internationals to Gloucester's seven. </p> <p>However, there was no disparity in terms of forward strength. The Cherry and Whites matched Stade's scrummage and saw second-rows Adam Eustace and Alex Brown steal crucial line-outs from their opponents. </p> <p>But for all the good work Gloucester endured a torrid time during a highly frustrating eight-minute period in the second half in which Stade took control. Gloucester should have been further ahead than 11-10 at half-time, but even that should not have prevented them from being in with a bigger shout at the end. On a few occasions in the first half they had torn Stade apart, only to blow the finish, and James Forrester's canter to the line was less than they Gloucester would have wanted from those early forays. </p> <p>Centre Henry Paul was largely a hero, but on one occasion a villain with a dreadful knock-on in the shadow of his own posts. He had given his side cause to dream and hope seven minutes after the break with a penalty, but three minutes later France prop Sylvain Marconnet was emerging from the bottom of a driven maul to claim the first of his two tries. </p> <p>Gloucester full-back John Goodridge charged down fly-half David Skrela's conversion attempt, but the son of legendary France back-row forward Jean-Claude made no mistake with a penalty that followed. </p> <p>Argentine scrum-half Agustin Pichot added to Gloucester's woes by scoring his second try, converted by Skrela, leaving the visitors trailing 25-14 as the last quarter approached. And Marconnet also claimed a second score, triumphantly emerging from a well driven line-out to effectively put the game beyond Gloucester's reach. </p> <p>The errors that cost Gloucester so dear continued and they then saw Mirco Bergamasco cruising through the middle of the field for Stade's only expansive try in a tally of five. </p> <p>Having proved to be a lively and effective attacker James Simpson-Daniel got his reward with two late tries, but the final score left the visitors tantalisingly short of a bonus point. </p> <p>With their five tries Stade claimed a bonus point of their own - a situation that must be factored into the remaining games of Gloucester's campaign, starting with Ulster's visit to Kingsholm on Saturday. Even so there was some good news for England coach Andy Robinson with Lion prop Phil Vickery coming through his toughest test of the season so far unscathed. In the face of Argentine loose-head Rodrigo Roncero, Vickery did more than enough to reassure the watching Robinson that his recovery from back surgery is now complete. </p> <p> <strong> STADE FRAN\u00e7AIS</strong> Dominici; Arias, Glas, Mirco Bergamasco, Mauro Bergamasco; Skrela, Pichot (Filol 75); Roncero (Lemoine 47), Blin, Marconnet, Auradou (capt), James (Brouzet 74), Rabadan, Jechoux (Moni 67), Sowerby. </p> <p><strong> GLOUCESTER: </strong> Goodridge; Garvey, Fanolua, Paul (Mauger 72), Simpson-Daniel; McRae, Gomarsall; Bezuidenhout (Sigley 54), Azam (Fortey 56), Vickery (Powell 60), Eustace, Brown (Buxton 55), Boer (capt), Hazell (Balding 69), Forrester. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> A Rolland (Ireland).</p>",
  "<p>Rubens Barrichello began the promise of a dream result for Brazilian race fans when the local hero claimed pole position for today's Brazilian Grand Prix. </p> <p>Adding further South American colour and interest, Juan Pablo Montoya will join his good friend on the front row of the grid as the Colombian attempts to score his first win this season while driving his last race for Williams-BMW. </p> <p>The good news for Barrichello fans was extended even further when his team-mate and most serious threat, Michael Schumacher, lost 10 places on the grid after crashing during free practice yesterday morning. </p> <p>Schumacher was forced to take over his spare car and, since this amounted to a change of engine, the world champion will move from eighth to eighteenth on the grid. He lost control on one of the many bumps that characterise this track, the Ferrari spinning and crashing heavily into a tyre barrier. Schumacher was unhurt, but there was a brief flash fire at the rear of the car as well as severe bodywork damage and broken suspension. The engine must also have been affected because the team did not consider swapping the V10 to the spare car in order to avoid the penalty. It leaves the way clear for Barrichello to achieve a result he has dreamed of. </p> <p>Barrichello's finishing record here is appalling. The man who was born and brought up within earshot of the track has only finished once in 11 attempts - and that was fourth place on his second grand prix in 1994. </p> <p>Last year, Barrichello used his local knowledge to perfect effect by steering round the puddles and rivers of water brought on by a brief deluge. On a day when Schumacher was among the many to spin off, Barrichello was salvaging Ferrari's honour by leading - until his car developed a 'fuel problem' and he coasted to a halt. The fuel problem turned out to be a lack of it in his tank, a miscalculation by the team having left him short. </p> <p>Barrichello's devastation was shared by one of the noisiest crowds to attend any grand prix. For once, the samba bands fell silent and the spectators trooped home. </p> <p>Spirits have been revived, particularly after Barrichello's recent wins in Italy and China. If he wins today, the joyful pandemonium will negate any complaints about this rather tatty circuit and reinforce the need for such theatres of motor sport to remain on the F1 calendar. </p> <p>The F1 teams will have covered more than 1,100 racing laps in 2004 when today's Grand Prix brings the season to an end but, as ever, the final political mile is proving the most difficult to negotiate. </p> <p>F1 bosses, have been locked in discussion for two days as they try to thrash out details of the sport's future, a task that has been made easier for once by all the teams - except Ferrari - agreeing on a package of reforms to cut costs and, in the process, perhaps save the British Grand Prix. </p> <p>The nine teams have agreed to limit a grand-prix weekend to two days with testing taking place on the Friday. This would be in place of the endless round of testing between races: a limit of 10 days' testing being proposed for the entire season. The teams are also keen to have a standard race tyre, thus reducing the need for testing while cutting speeds and slashing costs. </p> <p>In return, the teams say they would be able to afford run 19 races, which would let in the French and British Grands Prix, listed as provisional on the 2005 calendar. </p> <p>The six hours of meetings this weekend - reportedly the most amicable and productive for quite some time - have been brought into focus because, as one team owner said: 'Some of the bigger teams, who have been self-centred and blas\u00e9, have suddenly realised they will be in serious financial trouble if we don't take steps to cut costs.'</p>",
  "<p>Jens Lehmann does not go along with the old-fashioned theory that you have to be mad to be a goalkeeper, but he accepts that irrationality is part of the deal. 'If you always thought rationally, you would never dive at an attacker's feet,' the Arsenal goalkeeper says. 'You have to lose control in certain situations and not worry about getting kicked in the head. Goalkeeping is sometimes like an extreme sport. You have to let yourself go.' </p> <p>The Germany player certainly returned to Highbury to some extreme headlines last week, after his confident but misjudged forays from his line cost Arsenal two goals and two points against Panathinaikos in Athens. It was not the first time Lehmann had slipped up in the Champions League, either, and with Tim Howard in Manchester United's reserves after losing Sir Alex Ferguson's confidence, both teams taking part in the biggest Premiership game so far this season at Old Trafford today are said to be in the market for new goalkeepers. </p> <p>Yet if Lehmann is a liability, as his detractors complain, he saves most of his blunders for Europe. </p> <p>The 34-year-old former Borussia Dortmund player is the enigma at the heart of Arsenal's record-breaking unbeaten run. He has played in all but two of the 49 Premiership matches, the sequence having started at the end of the 2002-03 season before he arrived at Highbury. It means that he has played in 47 consecutive games, something none of the other Arsenal players has done. He has been at Highbury almost a season and a half and has yet to experience defeat in the Premiership, which is no mean feat for a so-called dodgy keeper. </p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, publicly at any rate, argues that Lehmann contributes enough positives to the team to outweigh any lapses. There is no doubt that his assertiveness and usually effective interventions allow Arsenal to play farther up the pitch. That, in its turn, has helped Arsenal to evolve into the sort of team who do not worry about going a goal down because they know that they can always score one or more at the other end. </p> <p>But there can be little doubt, either, that Lehmann is viewed as one of Arsenal's few weak links and there is increasing evidence that opponents are attempting to play on his weaknesses. Lehmann's shot-stopping ability, positioning and preference for punching rather than catching are legitimate avenues for opponents to explore, although many have cottoned on to the fact that his temperament might be his biggest vulnerability. Lehmann has been known to lose his temper, and with it his concentration, and having complained early on that he was surprised at the physicality of the English game, he gets a regular bumping and bruising at corners and free-kicks. </p> <p>The most recent time Arsenal were in Manchester, three weeks ago, City manager Kevin Keegan sent Richard Dunne forward at set pieces to make his considerable presence felt in close proximity to the goalkeeper. When David James went up for the last corner of the game and jumped straight into his opposite number, Wenger was moved to protest on Lehmann's behalf. </p> <p>'People are going overboard, Jens is entitled to more protection,' Wenger said. 'It is fair enough jumping for the ball, but people are not playing the ball, they are playing Jens and that's a foul.' </p> <p>Lehmann has said the same - 'The hardest thing to get used to in England was everyone attacking me, not the ball, and the ref never whistling' - but has learnt the sad truth that moaning only marks him out for more attention. </p> <p>For all his midweek miscalculations, Lehmann has at least proved more consistent and resilient than Howard, the United goalkeeper who won all the plaudits after two saves in a penalty shoot-out when both players made their debuts in the English game in the 2003 Community Shield. The American looked a real find but became erratic towards the end of last season and Ferguson lost patience after he was directly responsible for conceding the first goal away to Lyon last month. </p> <p>That match ended 2-2, as did Arsenal's in Athens last week, but whereas Lehmann can ride out the occasional mistake, Ferguson decided that Howard's unpredictability was making his defence twitchy. Roy Carroll is not the most nerveless and dependable of performers, either, and Ferguson has shown a reluctance to give him an extended run in the first team, but he made some important saves in Prague on Tuesday and is in the side on merit. </p> <p>His Premiership record is more broken than Lehmann's, but it bears comparison. He has lost only once in 27 appear ances and believes that Arsenal can be denied. 'We don't care how many goals they have scored,' he says. 'The way we are defending at the moment, there's no reason we can't keep a clean sheet.' </p> <p>The oddest aspect of the whole story, perhaps, with question marks over the goalkeeping roles at Old Trafford and Highbury, is that the apparent future of English goalkeeping changed hands in the summer for the modest sum of \u00a31.5million. Tottenham probably cannot believe their luck, especially since Paul Robinson has moved so adeptly into the England role within the past couple of months. </p> <p>United continue to be linked with everyone from Carlo Cudicini to Iker Casillas, while Arsenal are thought to fancy Norwich's England prospect, Robert Green, yet under everyone's noses Spurs got the snip of the summer from the great Leeds giveaway. And they did not even have a manager at the time. If Carroll or Lehmann gives a goal away today - a possibility that cannot be discounted - questions will have to be asked.</p>",
  "<p><strong> MALCOLM GLAZER'S ATTEMPT</strong> to buy Manchester United is in danger of collapsing because senior figures at Old Trafford fear a takeover would mean the club spending less than usual on signing players. </p> <p>United directors are concerned that if the American businessman takes control, he will have to spend most or all of the club's profits paying interest on the \u00a3400million loan he needs for his planned \u00a3800m takeover.</p> <p>While the seven directors are legally obliged to consider seriously any formal bid for the club, all the indications are that several are either lukewarm towards Glazer or hostile. They fear he would put up ticket prices, alienate fans and use club funds to repay debts.</p> <p>That could scupper Glazer and his sons' desire to own United because, crucially, they are understood to need the unanimous approval of the entire plc board, headed by chairman Roy Gardner, before being able to access the \u00a3400m in loans that their bank, JP Morgan, is arranging.</p> <p>The club have told the Stock Exchange that if Glazer mounts a formal offer they will examine not just whether it would enrich shareholders, but, unusually, 'the potential financial terms, possible financial structure and any impact these considerations may have on the future operation of the football club'.</p> <p>Glazer has another problem in the shape of United's biggest shareholders, John Magnier and JP McManus, who between them own 28.9 per cent of shares compared with Glazer's 28.1 per cent. They have already rejected Glazer's offer of \u00a33 a share and do not plan to reopen negotiations. The American accepts that without buying their stake, he has no chance of accumulating the 90 per cent he needs to get outright control and take United private.</p> <p>Glazer's mounting difficulties will cheer fans as they prepare for United's crucial match against Arsenal this afternoon. The disquiet in the boardroom echoes concerns already voiced by supporters groups.</p> <p>Another obstacle presented itself to Glazer last night when a leaked document, purportedly drawn up by some of his advisers, warned that JP Morgan would not release the \u00a3400m unless the United board recommends Glazer's ownership. That is unlikely. 'It is worth noting,' says the document, 'that JP Morgan historically would never finance a hostile UK takeover, so any transaction involving JP Morgan would need to be recommended by the MUFC board.'</p> <p>If Glazer is forced to abandon his plan, he could maintain his shareholding in case another wealthy individual or company attempts a takeover.</p>",
  "<p>Thinking of doing something different? Well, in that case, learn from those who have gone before you. Here a panel of people, who have all thoroughly planned for a career change, reveal the one thing they wished they'd known when they started out on their new future. </p> <p><strong> Dig deep </strong><br> </p> <p>Natasha Murrell, 36 and based in Buckinghamshire, used to manage the creation of e-commerce websites for large corporations, but last June all that changed. She enrolled in a one-year interior design course at KLC School of Design in London and now, freshly graduated, is busy freelancing. Looking back, Murrell says: 'I wish I had calculated just how dramatically changing careers would affect my finances. I did do the sums and in quite a lot of detail, but I was still surprised. I would recommend over-estimating the costs involved. I would also recommend saving enough money to buy some time to find the right job, rather than just having to take the first thing offered to you because money has become tight. This way you will have the freedom of choice. And that is what a career change should be all about.' </p> <p><strong> Train hard </strong><br> </p> <p>Around 13 years ago London-based Peter Jackson decided to stop working as a builder and start retraining as a prison teacher. The one thing the 43-year-old wishes he knew then was 'just how hard studying really is. You tend to believe that it's easy. But it's not. It's really demanding. And there are no short cuts. If you need that piece of paper, you've got to go out and get it. And you tend to forget the stress of all that - until you try to do it again. And when you do, you can suddenly find yourself feeling afraid. You've taken a risk and now you're wondering if you're going to be able to pull it off. And you have to build up your own self-confidence to see it through.' </p> <p><strong> Master patience and persistence </strong><br> </p> <p>Abbie Withers swapped being a veterinarian nurse for being her own boss three years ago. She now runs, in Wiltshire, Abbie's Animals, a company that provides specially trained creatures, great and small, to the film and television industry. The one thing Withers would have loved to have known at the beginning of her career change was just how long it would take to get herself up and running in her new profession. 'It can take much longer than you expect,' says the 42-year-old. 'Even once you've retrained and researched the opportunities available to you, there can still be a long wait before people give you the chance you need to start afresh. I suggest you be prepared to really prove yourself to people. Convince them that yes, you've come from a different background but you are now up for a new challenge.' </p> <p><strong> Brace yourself </strong><br> </p> <p>For nine years Jayne Martin travelled the world's hot spots as a chef with the RAF, but she gave that up in 2002 to become a social worker.

I was prepared for them. But there is the theory in your head and then there is the reality. And the difference between the two was quite something. But, and this is the thing, you do adapt.

He says: 'I would have felt better at the time I made the change if I had known where best to put my faith. When you experience a lot of uncertainty it's natural to worry, and yet all of the minor panics come and go and are forgotten, replaced by new ones. I wish I'd been able to trust that even though things might not turn out exactly as planned, I would, somehow, find a way. My advice to others would be to see changing careers as like going for a drive: pack basic repair essentials but then get on and enjoy the open road, knowing that if something does go wrong, you'll be able to cope.' </p> <p><strong>What a lot I could do, if I had a little money...</strong></p> <p>You need to fund your ambition.

  "<p>I am off work and my employer has asked for a medical report. I am worried that it will damage my employment prospects. What are my rights? </p> <p>You do not have to let your employer see a medical report, but there are dangers in taking such a step. </p> <p>Your employer must ask your permission before approaching your GP. You can refuse straight away or decide to look at the report first and then refuse. (You could ask your GP about the report and see if amendments could be made to it.) </p> <p>But if you do prevent your employer seeing the report, the employer has the right to make decisions in the absence of such information. In some cases, this could make it easier to dismiss you. </p> <p>The employer would need to try to get as much information about your condition by asking you about it, but could be justified in taking a pessimistic view of your likelihood of returning to work in the absence of evidence to the contrary. So if your doctor's notes say you can probably be fully capable of work in a month, you may well be better off showing them this report rather than letting them assume you will be incapacitated indefinitely. </p> <p>GPs often do their patients a disservice by being cagey in reports to employers, but if you want to keep your job and expect to be fully functioning fairly soon, you could encourage your GP to say this explicitly if they agree with it. </p> <p>Many will instead write down something about needing to monitor their patient's condition, leaving the issue up in the air for the employer.</p> <p><strong>I job-share and never work on Mondays. This means that the colleague I do the job- share with gets far more time off than I do due to bank holidays.This is extremely annoying and seems very unfair. What can I do about it? </strong> </p> <p>You are in a good position to argue your case, although many employers have not caught up with the changing law in this area and let such unfairnesses persist. </p> <p>Under regulations that came into effect in 2000, part-time workers should receive pay and benefits proportional to the pay and benefits of a full-time worker. So, if a full-time worker at your employer gets eight bank holidays off a year on top of their usual leave entitlement, you should get four if you work half-time. You could take your employer to a tribunal because they would appear to have breached the regulations in your case. If you are female, you could also claim indirect sex discrimination (but not if you are male; as Britain's part-time workforce is predominantly female breaches of the regulations can be construed as indirect sex discrimination). </p> <p>You should have a good case. The tribunal might well award you financial compensation for the bank holidays you have not enjoyed in the past and would probably expect your employer to regularise the situation in future. </p> <p>Your colleague is unlikely to be happy about all this, since his or her entitlement to bank holidays should also be regularised. If you job share on a 50-50 basis, you should get equal rights to bank holiday leave. </p> <p>This change in the law in 2000 overrides anything that might be said in your colleague's contract of employment or any argument they might otherwise try to make about their entitlement to bank holidays being set by custom and practice. </p> <p>Legal advice from Human and Legal Resources.</p>",
  "<p>Kevin and Vicki, 61 and 54, want an extra income to fund their retirement in France: Kevin writes: </p> <p>'I am a \"semi-retired\" teacher. I took early retirement in 1995. My pension is about \u00a3900 net per month. However, I have continued to work part-time doing supply teaching. </p> <p>My wife Vicki, aged 54, works in the student shop at the local university. She has accumulated bits and pieces of pensions over the years but we don't expect them to be worth much. </p> <p>We own a house which we hope to be able to sell for about \u00a3400,000. Our repayment mortgage of \u00a323,000 has about three years to go but we are currently paying more than we need in an attempt to clear it as quickly as possible. </p> <p>Our savings amount to only about \u00a314,000 (consisting mainly of a Tessa-only Isa, a telephone instant access and shares in the Halifax worth about \u00a32,500). My wife also has about \u00a32,000 in a savings account. </p> <p>We would like to sell our house and move to France. We love France and see this as the only practical way of being able to retire as our savings are so small. We had intended to wait until next summer but we have become aware that although the house market is slowing here, this is not the case in France. So we are planning to put our UK property on the market after Christmas. </p> <p>My brother already has a house in the Dordogne and we will probably use that as a base when we are looking for property. The sort of property we would like will cost about \u00a3140,000. This would leave us \u00a3200,000-\u00a3220,000 from the sale of our current house to invest to produce an income. We calculate that we would need a net income of about \u00a31,000 a month on top of my pension to live on. I am, of course, due to receive the state pension of about \u00a36,000 a year in September 2008. </p> <p>We are not sure whether to invest our money or buy another property, say a gite in France, which we could rent out. Are there any other issues we should take into account when we retire abroad?</p> <p><strong> Protect yourself against currency moves</strong></p> <p>When moving abroad it pays to take time to find the right property. It might even be sensible to rent for a while. </p> <p>Steve Travis, overseas manager at the Fry Group, says: 'Property prices in many parts of Europe such as France are heavily influenced by what is happening in the UK. My advice would be for Kevin and Vicki to keep their nerve and shop around, as prices may well ease off in line with the UK.' </p> <p>As far as your existing savings are concerned, your Tessa-only Isa is tax-free and can remain in place, but you could consider transferring your other savings offshore now, to get the tax-free clock ticking. According to Travis, 'Accounts such as the Bradford and Bingley Accumulation Account in the Isle of Man are ideal for those planning to move abroad in one or two years' time. The capital sum earns gross interest but this is not added to the account until it is closed - by which time the accountholder could be resident abroad.' </p> <p>Exchange rates are an important consideration, says Robert Rackliffe of advisory firm Origen. Travis explains: 'Any change in the dynamics of the currency between sterling and the euro could have a major impact on Kevin and Vicki's purchasing power. Once their UK property is sold, I advise placing around \u20ac250,000 on deposit and leaving the rest in sterling. Although euro interest rates are lower, the currency protection it will provide more than makes up for this.' </p> <p>A vital point to consider is your UK state pensions. If you move abroad beyond age 60, you will not get automatic National Insurance Contribution (NIC) credits, so you may not get the full state pension. Both of you should apply for a pension forecast and if there is an obvious shortfall, pay Class 3 voluntary contributions. These cost about \u00a3300 a year but are worth it. </p> <p>As to the extra income you wish to generate, one option would be to place your \u00a3220,000 on deposit in sterling at about 5 per cent which could achieveabout \u00a311,000 a year gross. But this would mean having all your income in sterling while your outgoings are in euros. </p> <p>You could hedge this problem by holding some of your investment capital in euros to maintain your purchasing power in case sterling weakens. However, as euro inter est rates are lower, the income it would generate is lower. This may mean dipping into capital - which is not necessarily a bad thing, says Rackliffe. 'Capital erosion at a slow and controlled rate is often preferable for people in retirement than a sudden loss of capital which can occur with a higher-risk investment.' </p> <p>The second option is to consider a balanced portfolio that could provide some capital growth over time. Travis says: 'A typical balanced managed portfolio should contain cash, fixed-interest securities in sterling and euros, property funds and equities. Such a portfolio of \u00a3220,000 should be able to generate dividends of 4 per cent, or \u00a39,000 a year. This is below Kevin and Vicki's target, so a combination of dividend and capital withdrawals may be necessary until Kevin's state pension comes on stream.' When considering investments, bear in mind French tax liability. </p> <p>From 15 January 2005 it should be possible for British insurance companies to offer their products in France. This should improve the range of investments available. </p> <p>The final option is to buy another French property and manage it for rental, but Rackliffe says: 'I doubt that a gite would generate the necessary income after taxes, maintenance costs and periods of unnoccupancy.' </p> <p>You also need to consider healthcare. The E111 procedure will not be available once you move to France permanently. Once you receive the state pension, you will be entitled to a refund of up to 75 per cent of healthcare costs. To cover any shortfall, a private health policy would be advisable. </p> <p>Anyone moving abroad needs to review their will. In terms of UK inheritance tax, you will be deemed domiciled in the UK for up to three years after departure. Once you buy a property in France, it is essential to take out a French will. '</p> <p>(Advice is for guidance only)</p> <p><strong>Kevin and Vicki's to-do list:</strong></p> <p>1. By all means sell your property here, but don't rush into a French purchase; take your time. </p> <p>2. Consider moving some savings offshore to save tax. </p> <p>3. Place the money you have earmarked for your French property into a euro account to protect yourself in case the euro strengthens against sterling. </p> <p>4. Ask the Department of Work and Pensions for forecasts of your state pension so you can work whether you need to pay voluntary NICs. </p> <p>5. Consider splitting your investment capital between euro and sterling accounts as a hedge against exchange- rate fluctuations. </p> <p>6. Find out about private medical insurance that will cover you in France. </p> <p>7. Make sure you draw up a French will.</p> <p><strong>Let us help you:</strong> Do you need some financial coaching?

  "<p>What is it about the drinks industry that makes them look soft targets for governments seeking a bit of voter popularity? Margaret Thatcher took on the brewing industry towards the end of her time, and produced the Beer Orders, which were meant to free the pub trade from the grip of what used to be called the 'Beerage'. In fact, they wrecked the UK business, to the point where virtually the whole industry is foreign-owned. The drinks companies changed strategy and moved on, adapting to survive in the post-Beer Orders climate. Pubs became more sophisticated, family-friendly places, where you could eat decent food as well as get a drink. On the whole, they were a lot better than the 'boozers' of old, with their 'blokey and smokey' image. </p> <p>The health legislation being proposed by the government - or at least that part of it happy to be called 'New' Labour - is once again focusing on the drinks companies for a few cheap votes. The plan is to ban smoking in pubs that serve hot food, which seems pretty sensible and straightforward, but which could be as disastrous as anything Thatcher did. </p> <p>The economics of the industry suggest that the outcome could be the opposite of what the government intends. About 24 per cent of average pub sales come from food, but this is comparatively low-margin business. Preparing and serving food costs a lot more than pulling a pint. </p> <p>So if pubs have to choose between losing low margin food customers or high margin smokers, many will choose the latter. So welcome back the smokey old boozers of old, serving a packet of crisps and a bag of peanuts. </p> <p>The drinks industry has put up its own compromise, which is a gradual move towards pubs that are 80 per cent non-smoking by 2009. This is not enough for the 'hizbollah tendency' in the health department, who want to ban all smoking. You can only hope that the sanity of old gaspers like John Reid will prevail when the white paper is finally unveiled, probably in the next few weeks.</p> <p><strong>Revealed: the bank manager with a heart</strong></p> <p>I have never heard anything like it from my bank manager. 'We can only thank you, from the bottom of our hearts for your efforts.' But then, I've never heard any banker talk like this about anybody, ever: 'As a bank, it was a privilege to be part of the whole thing.' </p> <p>This was Peter Cummings, head of corporate banking at HBOS, to Philip Green last week as they celebrated Arcadia's sparkling set of results. Maybe the bubbles had gone to his head at the champagne breakfast, or maybe he was genuinely overwhelmed to have his loans repaid and a \u00a340 million dividend paid out on top. But I must say it all seemed well over the top. </p> <p>'Integrity - your leader has that by the barrel-load,' gushed Cummings to a gathering of financiers, Arcadia staff and 'selected' press, as Tina Green shook her head in stunned admiration of her husband, and wiped away a tear of emotion. It made the Oscars ceremony look like a meeting of the Society of Actuaries. </p> <p>Get a grip, Mr Cummings: it is only money, after all. You can't take it with you when you go off to the great Head Office in the sky, you know. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the rumour-mongers are at it again with Marks and Spencer. A visit by an executive from Brandes, the US investor that owns 11 per cent of M&amp;S, is assumed to be the prelude to another bid by Green, who is free to have a second go at Stuart Rose's company next year. But then she also met Stuart Rose, Justin King and Sir Ken Morrison. </p> <p>It sounds to me like Brandes's Ms Morris was just checking up on her portfolio, rather than preparing the next bid. Brandes, remember, was actually rather supportive of Marks in the summer, promising that it would not back Green without the M&amp;S board's approval. I doubt it's changed its mind yet.</p> <p><strong>Reds' fallback position</strong></p> <p>So Keith Harris has got some money behind him after all, in the shape of Nomura International, as he struggles to get the fans on his side at Manchester United. But, despite the Seymour Pierce man's undoubted talent and enthusiasm for the United cause, it looks a forlorn hope. </p> <p>The Man U holding company is caught in a Mexican standoff between the Irish shareholders and the American Malcolm Glazer. With nearly 60 per cent between the two of them, it's hard to imagine Harris and the fans coming up with the 25 per cent needed to pursue a securitisation plan. </p> <p>There are more twists and turns to this story than a Ronaldo dribble, and Harris may be able to prise away a few more shares - maybe Dermot Desmond, the owner of Celtic who has 2 per cent of United, and Harry Dobson, the Glaswegian with nearly 7 per cent, will come to his rescue. </p> <p>But he has a fallback plan. Harris is also talking to Mike Jefferies, another American who thinks there's money to be made in British football, this time with Liverpool football club. Now, wouldn't it be the irony of ironies if Harris lost out at United, and ended up with a say in the running of his arch-enemies down the East Lancs road.</p>",
  "<p>British companies operating in Iraq as part of the reconstruction effort have sharply cut back the numbers of people working in the country as security fears have mounted through the spate of kidnappings, attacks and the ongoing insurgencies of recent weeks. </p> <p>Companies once keen to win contracts to rebuild vital power, water, communications and transport links have ditched plans to send people out and are now not likely to do so until there is a serious improvement. Those that remain often find they are kicking their heels as security problems interrupt their operations. Meanwhile, they are still paid. </p> <p>The British Consultants and Construction Bureau (BCCB), a trade body representing 12 of the UK companies with employees in Iraq - including engineers and contractors Costain, Halcrow, Mott Macdonald and Black &amp; Veatch - says that the risk to employees has caused those companies to reassess their operations and has prevented others from even considering sending their people to the country. </p> <p>Graham Hand, its chief executive, says: 'I don't think there have been any new entrants [to Iraq] among infrastructure companies in the past year. Those that are there have tended to slim down where possible.' </p> <p>He says there has been no 'mass exodus', but that the 'slimming' has been dramatic. 'I would say that between 25 and 50 per cent of people who were there are not there any more. There are two things that can be done - take greater security precautions to avoid their people being soft targets, and reduce the numbers to reduce the target.' </p> <p>Andy Bearpark, former director of operations for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Bagdhad, now a director at Olive Security, one of the companies supplying armed protection to the contractors, says: 'There was a feeling things were getting better in August and September last year. It was probably only stable, and when you got to March, that is when things started getting very seriously more difficult. They continued to get more difficult, and will continue to do so.' </p> <p>In the intervening seven months, 12 British nationals have been killed, according to the Foreign Office. With the uprisings in Falluja and Najaf, mortar attacks on the supposedly safe 'Green Zone' in Baghdad this month, the abduction and murder of Ken Bigley and the kidnapping of Maria Hassaan, the risks have grown even in the past fortnight. </p> <p>Hand says: 'People are now telling me \"It's not for us, we're glad we're not in there, and we wouldn't touch it\".' </p> <p>For those who are there, however, operations remain extremely difficult. 'People say that things have slowed down out there,' Hand says. 'In practical terms, that means people are not working with 100 per cent efficiency. They want to be working, but can't.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, work coming from the spending authorities has been sporadic. They are the US Project and Contracting Office, an agency of the Department of Defence, which manages $12.6 billion of the $18.4bn reconstruction money agreed by the US Congress, and the Iraqi ministries, which now have control over funds left from the oil for food programme, oil revenues and international donations. </p> <p>One major contractor, who, like most operators in Iraq refuses to talk publicly for security reasons, had said earlier this month that 'the issue of task orders [orders to carry out specific actions, such as fixing electricity wires] has been held up'. However, by last week the process was beginning to pick up, although the pace was sporadic. </p> <p>According to the PCO's website, 201 out of 390 planned orders have been issued. So far $11.6bn in funds has been committed under the programmes, but only $1.2bn has been spent. </p> <p>Meanwhile, major infrastructure providers point to difficulties that are emerging in relations with the Iraqi government. One group of suppliers met Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Alawi when he visited the UK this month. </p> <p>'The problem is the terms of the contracts they are offering,' one of the suppliers said. 'With the Americans these are \"cost-plus\" deals. With the Iraqi government, there are still risks, such as security, which the contractor has to bear. These need to be sorted out before anything gets agreed.' </p> <p>More evidence of slowdown comes from UK-based insurers. On the one hand, underwriters are reporting increases in premiums for personal injury and kidnap and ransom (K&amp;R) insurance. A spokewoman for Hiscox, one such underwriter says: 'There has been an increase in premiums and also in inquiries for K&amp;R since the war ended. We now advise companies that they should buy both personal injury and K&amp;R for Iraq, whereas before we would have said only one of them.' </p> <p>Large insurers, however, have found a slump in demand for this business. One said: 'A year ago we thought that Iraq represented a considerable opportunity for business. But people both in the UK and Europe have told us there is simply not the work out there to justify the risk of sending people out. The work orders have been slow so we have given up trying to market the business to our clients. </p> <p>'It is not just for Iraq. I have talked to people who are now wary of sending people to Saudi Arabia because of the increased risks.' </p> <p>While companies have looked to follow Foreign Office advice and have scaled back operations to those that are 'essential', they still have to bear security costs, which have also risen too. Security companies agree that a former army or military police guard costs between $500 and $750 a day, but costs have spiked well above that - for example, $1,000 a day was charged by those guarding Iraqi ministers in the weeks after the handover of power on 30 June. </p> <p>BCCB represents three security companies in Iraq - Olive, Control Risks Group and Aegis. Hand says these are the exception to the trend among his members; the numbers they have committed to Iraq have increased. </p> <p>As he would be expected to, Bearpark, now with Olive, says demand has increased as the situation has deteriorated. While there was concern in ex-military circles in the spring that the Iraq- induced demand would fall, the bonanza for ex-soldiers continues unabated. 'We talk of between 10,000 and 20,000 security people in Iraq,' he says. 'Demand has increased.' </p> <p>He adds that there is generally a good enough supply of people leaving the armed forces to fill whatever is needed, but conceded that supply is as stretched as it has ever been. There have been problems caused, for example, by Nepal's reluctance to endorse the participation of ex-Ghurka soldiers. This has economic implications for the companies. Ghurkas are what is known euphemistically as 'good value' because they have traditionally been paid less. </p> <p>Contractors are only too aware of this. One official at a major company says: 'We used to talk about security costs taking up 20 per cent of the costs in a contract. That has gone up to around 30 per cent.' </p> <p>For the giants, such as Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, Parsons, Berger and Fluor of the US and Amec of the UK, which have prime contracts with the US Department of Defence under the six major infrastructure programmes, these costs are of accounting interest only, since they are passed on to the American government according to the 'cost-plus' basis under which deals were signed. </p> <p>However, for others, they can be a significant problem. One major contractor said: 'We pass these on, but have heard of other companies which are not able to do so and have to operate with less security than they would ideally like.' </p> <p>Hand says this is unlikely, but adds: 'You can't expect the redevelopment of Iraq to be subsidised out of these companies' pockets. If you arrive at a situation where the person bearing the contract will not allocate more funds to security, and the costs rise, people will think again. There is an equation.' </p> <p>The message coming out now is that people are beginning to think again. </p> <p>'People tell me: \"If we cannot protect our people, then we will have to get out\",' Hand says. 'We are closer to that than we have been before.'</p>",
  "<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Californian governor, dubbed presidential hopeful John Kerry an 'economic girlie man' at the Republican party's New York convention last month. </p> <p>But the Governator was holding something back - he didn't tell those endorsing the Bush candidacy that he hadn't been man enough to get to the Big Apple under his own steam. Schwarzenegger's trip to New York - worth a whopping $350,000 - was paid in large part by Pfizer, the biggest drug company in the world. </p> <p>Just why Pfizer backs Arnie and the Republicans is now a campaign issue in the California Senate race. Pharmaceutical firms are desperate to see Republicans maintain control of the Golden State. The Hollywood star turned politician has received close to $500,000 from pharmaceutical companies since beginning his run for office last year. </p> <p>But recent events could backfire badly on the Governator and his paymasters. Furthermore, there are growing calls for all Schwarzenegger's drug money to be paid back. An unseemly row is brewing over sick and old people in California, too poor to buy medicine, organising themselves to take trains up to Canada, where drug prices are much lower. The drugs are imported back to California and distributed to the needy. In trade-law speak, this is known as 'parallel importation', and under intellectual property law it is highly contentious. </p> <p>It seems Pfizer's and other drug firm's campaign donations initially paid off. Earlier this month, Schwarzenegger rejected Democrat proposals targeting the high cost of prescription drugs. Part of these proposals was to legitimise parallel importation from Canada. Schwarzenegger said the measures would have broken federal law and made the state vulnerable to lawsuits if anyone got ill from imported drugs. Not true, said the Democrats. </p> <p>A similar debate is raging across the rest of the US, and it is, for the most part, split down party lines. That explains why drug-firm donations to the Republicans far outstrip those to the Democrats. In the 2002 election cycle, out of total contributions of $29.4m, drug firms lavished $21.7m on the party of George W Bush. </p> <p>Joel Bakan's new book, The Corporation, shows how, after donating more than $1m to Congressional candidates - most of them Republicans - during the 2001 election cycle, Eli Lilly was the beneficiary of a provision buried in the Homeland Security Act that protected makers of thimerosal, a preservative used in vaccines, from lawsuits arising out of harm caused by the drug's use. Eli Lilly was the sole manufacturer of the substance. </p> <p>The provision was eventually removed after intense public outcry.</p>",
  "<p>The Economist is poised to break through the 1 million circulation barrier, according to sources at Pearson. </p> <p>The Economist Group is majority owned by Pearson, also owner of the Financial Times, but is run by an independent editorial trust. It posted pre-tax profits of \u00a3160m in the year to March 2004. </p> <p>The Economist 's overseas expansion over the last four decades has pushed its global circulation - which stood at 908,832 in the second half of 2003, the latest period for which official figures are available - to the brink of 1m. </p> <p>Sources at the magazine, which is edited by Bill Emmott, expect the figure to be exceeded by the end of the year and are planning a series of events to publicise the achievement in 2005. </p> <p>The magazine has invested heavily in its US edition, which sold an average of 436,803 copies in the July-December period last year, a 7 per cent increase on the same period in 2002. </p> <p>Its average UK circulation stands at 147,475, according to ABC.

  "<p>'He's a natural optimist and that helps him get through situations most people would feel in despair about,' says Archie Norman, the Tory MP and former Asda chairman who, along with Allan Leighton, performed one of the UK's most remarkable business turnarounds in the 1990s. </p> <p>When this dynamic duo came together at Asda in 1992, they inherited \u00a31 billion worth of debt, a business that was about to breach all its banking covenants, with a market capitalisation of only \u00a3400 million. Nobody would have thought the ailing 'Associated Dairies' would be sold within seven years to the biggest retailer in the world, Wal-Mart. It was sold for a cool \u00a37bn, and as Leighton likes to remind everyone who asks about the Asda miracle, 'Every single person in the company got a share of that.' </p> <p>This is no throwaway line. It says everything about the guiding principles of one of our premier business leaders: 'It's all about people'. A nice line, but in the time I have known him, this is anything but clich\u00e9. </p> <p>All leaders are different, but the best are very clear on what they stand for, and are good at communicating this, sometimes directly and sometimes more subtly. It has become clear to me, and most of those who have worked for Leighton, that he stands for the most striking self-belief, but with natural humility. </p> <p>At first, these two attributes may seem strange bedfellows, but all the best leaders have them, though not always in equal measure. When they approach per fect balance, it leads to inspirational leadership. Think Nelson Mandela. </p> <p>We tend to view the best business leaders as having that 'edge', something tough and incisive, at times ruthless but also inspiring. Leighton has all this and more. Born in 1953 in Hereford, he attended polytechnic in Oxford before joining the confectionery group Mars in 1974, eventually rising to marketing manager. From there, he joined Pedigree Pet Foods as marketing director, and then Asda in 1992. </p> <p>As one of the 'men from Mars' he was selected to go on a series of fast-track attachments. This was pivotal in his career: someone believed in him, when perhaps he did not believe in himself. This has made him both a great spotter of talent and a great champion of talent. </p> <p>He became Asda chief executive in 1996. After Wal-Mart acquired Asda, seven years later, he was made chief exec of Wal-Mart Europe. He left in 2000 to 'go plural', taking on a number of non-executive directorships, including BSkyB, Lastminute.com, Leeds United FC, Wilson Connolly, Cannons, and Dyson. </p> <p>But the jobs that have kept him high profile have been his partnership with Phillip Green at BHS and Arcadia, and the most surprising and challenging of his roles, the executive chairmanship of the Royal Mail. He has needed all his social skills for this one. </p> <p>On first meeting, he is accessible and personal. He has that rare ability never to cede control of a meeting and, simultaneously, never to allow the conversation to feel as though it is a business meeting. </p> <p>When Philip Green first declared his intention to bid for M&amp;S in 2000, he had solicited the help of Leighton, who was initially going to be his chief executive if the bid got off the ground. It was not to be, but they had forged an enduring friendship. The buccaneering Green had found the perfect foil to his direct and abrasive style. When the BHS bid was accepted, the two had intelligently swapped roles, with Leighton as chairman. </p> <p>This is where his true strengths lie. Keeping things simple and focusing on the people and the customers. He has always said, 'Your people will treat the customers the way you treat them.' The Arcadia acquisition and the spectacular rewards delivered again this week by way of dividend are proof of the current retail 'dream team's' runaway success at changing the rules of retailing in the UK. </p> <p>But what about the Royal Mail? </p> <p>Some 250,000 people, 'bone crunchingly' low morale, industrial relations from the darkest of ages, an atrocious service, losing millions of pounds a week, the spectre of open competition with all the big foreign players licking their lips. </p> <p>Tempting for Britain's most sought after business leader? Why? He had it all, but why did he need this? Well, let's go back to the self-belief and humility. This job could not be done, they said, not by anyone. Leighton will never buy that. It can be done, was his answer, and furthermore he could it. </p> <p>He also has the chance to prove himself in the public sector. There was no question that this was about money. At \u00a320,000 a year, this was about Leighton. </p> <p>But could even he pull this coup off? I have learned two things over the years of knowing him: never bet against him, and never make him an enemy. </p> <p>It has not all been plain sailing since leaving Asda. His most severe test came as deputy chairman of Leeds United FC. In terms of size and market capitalisation, this did not appear to be a huge challenge, but the club went from one crisis to another. It spent, overspent and spent even more. Off-field problems were matched by poor results, and managers came and went. The chairman was a liability and Leighton never appeared able to bring to bear the simplicity and common sense that were his hallmarks. The fans looked to the man who had turned around Asda to work his magic. What became clear was that football clubs masquerade as businesses, and astute businessmen should resist the temptation to become fans. </p> <p>He departed quietly, and perhaps better understands his own limitations. He could never win over a board that lacked cold business logic. Hope and enthusiasm are never enough, even with Leighton on the board. </p> <p>He has taken tough decisions at the Mail. Sacking 30,000 people was difficult, but it was about survival. He acted decisively, but humanely. He has brought the organisation back to profit, and he even won a vote against the union. </p> <p>He did this by being visible, being accessible and listening to his frontline operators. </p> <p>He has been accused of being a little too direct and blunt in the past, and is not afraid to bypass both his management and the union hierarchy in order to get things done. This has left many of his middle managers feeling disenfranchised and at times alienated. </p> <p>When asked about the redundancy programme, his answer says everything about him. 'You can't be led by emotion. You have to do the right thing. You know what's right and what's not. In the tough stuff, you have to be quite ruthless, but that doesn't mean you don't do it with respect. </p> <p>'If I were ever fired, how would I want it to be? I'd want someone to sit me down and say: \"It hasn't worked out, these are the reasons why and therefore we think it's time to move on. Now, whatever we can do to help you, we are quite prepared to do.\"' </p> <p>You doubt, somehow, that he will ever hear those words.</p>",
  "<p>'I'm trying to bridge art and commerce,' mumbled Ian Schrager in a heavy Brooklyn drawl while sipping an iced Coke in the bar of his stylish St Martin's Lane hotel in London's West End. 'I'm still looking for my masterpiece.' </p> <p>The 58-year-old hotelier describes himself as 'a home-run hitter'. In other words his projects don't fiddle round the edges. They make an impact. </p> <p>This is no exaggeration. It was Schrager who jointly founded and ran New York's Studio 54 which, in the Seventies, was the world's most famous nightclub and disco's holy shrine of hedonistic excess. Following a year in jail for tax evasion, he went on to redefine hotels with a blend of nightclub chic and provocative, ironic design. </p> <p>Schrager, with his French partner Philippe Starck, tapped into nascent wannabe celebrity culture, created the first boutique hotels and made lobbies a place to be seen in. But today there is a big question he has to face up to: Is he past it or is there something left to bring to the party? </p> <p>His business empire has hit a crossroads. His nine luxury hotels are only just emerging from serious financial difficulties. But if the Brooklyn-born law graduate can create a new genre in entertainment it would see the 58-year-old hotelier emerge triumphant as perhaps the most vivid encapsulation of style and commerce over the last 30 years. </p> <p>In his first newspaper interview since his difficulties emerged, Schrager appears chastened, but has no doubt about his place in the scheme of things: 'I'm in the opportunity business. I started in hotels responding to the opportunity. When I sold Studio 54, I was given an IOU. \"What have you got?\" \"A hotel.\" I took it. We traded.' </p> <p>The trading shows no sign of stopping now. Schrager is gearing up for a new phase. Whether it follows the template he masterminded from his backroom at Studio 54 - the media frenzy, the celeb clientele, the smart design - is unclear. That reached a glittering lucrative climax in the manic run-up to the new millennium, when it was said that his hotel empire rang up profits of \u00a3120m. </p> <p>But the party gave way to a mighty hangover. The dotcom bubble burst, planes flew into New York buildings and George Bush invaded Iraq. The hotel market has been on its knees since. </p> <p>For Schrager, the pummelling was severe. Bank covenants of $355m were breached last year and his hotel in San Francisco, the Clift, filed for bankruptcy protection. </p> <p>Media reports over the last year have centred on whether style gurus have tired of his creations; his space eaten away by imitators. Schrager acknowledges imitation and has a word for it: 'Schragerisation'. But he insists only a 'visionary and not a functionary' can carry it off. 'I don't mean that to sound...' Arrogant? 'It's not arrogant.' </p> <p>Schrager is undoubtedly a tough nut. And he is in town to put the record straight. After a year's silence, his message is that he is back and soaking up new influences. Trips to Istanbul and Croatia are feeding the muse. Ecleticism and bohemia is where it's at, he reckons. Far harder to imitate than minimalism. </p> <p>Travelling the world, Schrager is only taking on projects that take his fancy. He is working on hotel projects in New York with new design partners, John Pawson and multimedia artist Julian Schnabel. He has commissioned Herzog and De Meuron to build the first major new building in New York for years. Those who know him say he should do more in Europe. 'He doesn't realise how successful he could be there,' said one business partner. </p> <p>As for financial difficulties, Schrager says they are behind him. His bank debt has been refinanced. The Clift has emerged from bankruptcy protection with 'creditors getting 100 cents in the dollar'. Its demise was 'an embarrassing mistake that should never have happened', brought on by the downturn in Silicon Valley's dotcom industry. The Clift is ringfenced from his other assets. </p> <p>Now he is engaged in the sale of his two London hotels, the Sanderson and St Martin's Lane. The timing could hardly be better. The London market is on the march again after three years in the doldrums. Room occupancy rates are rising. US businessmen and tourists are returning. London is, for obvious reasons, their only European destination. </p> <p>Hotels were further rejuvenated by the \u00a3750m sale of the Savoy Group by US investor Blackstone to an Irish consortium. This deal worked out at more than \u00a31m per room. And a wall of money from overseas investors is beating a path to London to buy up trophy assets. </p> <p>For more than a year, Schrager's hotel business partner, the property firm Burford, has been trying to persuade Schrager to sell his two London establishments. Last August he relented. Schrager wants \u00a3200m but associates say anything over \u00a3150m would be a result. Schrager is adamant he will retain management of the hotels. But others say he could be bought out. </p> <p>He grew up in Brooklyn's East Flatbush. From good Jewish middle-class stock, his father - who was big in real estate - would have blanched at the thought of his son making a living running nightclubs. </p> <p>Although if you believe rumours - always flatly denied by Schrager junior - his father was used to living near the edge, with alleged Mob connections. Both parents had died by the time Schrager was 24. They were spared the trauma of his time in jail. It was a time when life was out of control. </p> <p>Studio 54 introduced the world to the purple rope, an 'in-crowd' door policy. It was where Andy Warhol, David Bowie and Mick Jagger partied and Bianca Jagger famously made her entrance on a white horse. It was also where raiding police found $1m in bin bags hidden in the club's ceiling. A further $2.5m was believed to have been 'skimmed'. </p> <p>Prison hit Schrager hard. For months he was held in a maximum-security wing, rubbing shoulders with murderers. He paid inmates to keep him from harm. But prison was in a sense the making of him; he had time to develop his new hotel concept. </p> <p>His colourful life belies his understated manner. But he doesn't miss a trick. 'I used to travel between Boston and New York. The Boston skirts weren't as short as in New York.' </p> <p>Schrager last year flew to Iraq with US General Tommy Franks to 'be a part of history'. He believes the negative portrayal of the war by the New York Times is misguided, but he will back John Kerry when the US goes to the polls next month, citing Bush's mismanagement of the economy as his main reason. </p> <p>His free time is spent with his two daughters Sophia, 10, and Ava, seven. He is divorced from his wife Rita, a former ballet dancer. 'For most of my life, business was my life. I'm 58. I had kids in my late forties. I can afford to be selfless and patient. Maybe 10 years ago I wouldn't have been like that.' </p> <p>He delights in recalling how his elder daughter confessed to him that she can never pre-plan what she is going to wear because it never looks right. Schrager wears a green woollen V-neck over a white T-shirt. 'That's it. I'm the same,' he said, raising his hands like Robert de Niro's brother. </p> <p>But there could be a downside to having Schrager as your dad. His simply furnished, gargantuan 4,000 sq ft apartment in Nolita, that's 'North of Little Italy', is all white, even the curtains. Make a mess at your peril. </p> <p>You wonder if now, at 58, he doesn't tire of the endless demand to create hype; to ensure the kooky product not only enthralls but satisfies demanding customers. 'I will always be doing something. I need to.' Celebrity pals include Madonna, De Niro and Bowie.

  "<p>Try as they might, Leicester cannot find the ruthlessness they need to take them from their mid-table position into a serious promotion challenge. This was their fourth consecutive score draw and although it was not a late goal that denied them, it will frustrate them as much as any other. </p> <p>They outplayed Stoke until going 1-0 ahead, but largely because of the conditions, they let slip their stranglehold and allowed Tony Pulis's team to escape with a point. 'In the first period, a Premiership team would have struggled to live with us,' said director of football Dave Bassett. 'I can't remember when Leicester played as well as that.' </p> <p>Stoke were made to scrap and scurry for any possession as the home team swamped their box straight from the kick-off. Even before the opening goal, Danny Tiatto had orchestrated most of his team's brightest moments and set the tone in the first minute with a sharp inswinging free-kick that James Scowcroft headed straight at Ed de Goey. Tiatto's tenacity brought Leicester their next sight of goal when he charged down De Goey's hesitant clearance and was unlucky that there was insufficient momentum to carry it over the line. </p> <p>Stoke were also struggling to subdue Leicester's right-sided players and the threatening passage of play down this flank culminated in a free- kick taken by Scot Gemmill that was met by an audacious, acrobatic effort from Matthew Heath. Leicester's ingenuity was rewarded by Tiatto as he identified the gaping hole in the Stoke defence and slotted home an angled shot that flew past De Goey after a heavy deflection off John Halls. Leicester still refused to subside, but Stoke crept back into the game once the early barrage had died down and Ade Akinbiyi, roundly booed by home fans, began to make his presence felt. </p> <p>Leicester should have sniffed the danger when Akinbiyi sent Carl Asaba clean through on goal before he was hauled back for offside, but they did not and, just a minute later, the same pair linked up to put Stoke level. It ended a goal drought that had seen Stoke fail to score in their four previous matches. </p> <p>During half-time, the rain lashed down and it quickly became apparent in the second half that both teams would require extra concentration to avoid being embarrassed by an awkward bounce. Michael Duberry was the first to switch off as he sent a swirling header towards his goalkeeper and was saved from humiliation only by his own inaccuracy. Stoke began to make better use of the conditions, though, with some impressive close control from their midfielders. Akinbiyi almost put them in front when his header was palmed away by Kevin Pressman before Asaba made a real mess of the rebound. </p> <p>Generally, the second half resembled a chess match, with both sides probing away at each other. Stoke manager Pulis denied that the downpour warranted an abandonment. 'Once you've started, you want to finish,' he said.</p>",
  "Recently I wrote in Jobs &amp; Money about the late payment charges made by most credit card companies. Typically, these involve the levying of around \u00a325 on the account of someone who pays a day late, even if this is caused by the company's tardy dispatch of the bill. <p>Such charges are unlikely to be enforced by the courts: penalty clauses are legally void unless they reflect the loss the party enforcing them has suffered. </p> <p>This is hardly cutting edge law. None of the dozens of banks who issue UK cards, and who will lose out if people follow my advice not to pay them, has contacted Jobs &amp; Money or me to take issue with what I wrote. Over the years I have had a few of these penalties levied on me, and invariably when I have refused to pay them, I have been told that the charge would be \"refunded\", usually as \"a goodwill gesture\". </p> <p>If banks thought this argument wrong, they could have taken a test case through the courts to establish their entitlement from someone who refused to pay. </p> <p>Closely related to these penalties, as Cornish reader Bob Egerton wrote to me to point out, are the charges most banks levy for unauthorised overdrafts. </p> <p>A typical scenario is a person allowed a \u00a3500 facility, with an interest rate of 7%, which amounts to about 67p per week. That person overdraws by \u00a3501 and it suddenly becomes unauthorised. The interest rate shoots up to 29% on the entire amount - about \u00a33.98 for the week - and a charge of \u00a325 is made, sometimes with a substantial amount for each day and each transaction on top. </p> <p>The bank is at no greater risk of losing its money because of the extra \u00a31. There is no significant extra administrative work; at most, a computer-generated letter. </p> <p>In reality, of course, these charges are punishment for doing something unauthorised and are no more legally sustainable than credit card penalties. </p> <p>On the other hand, the vast majority of people assume that when a bank makes a demand of them, they are obliged to pay. Those who are not completely in control financially and have to resort to unauthorised overdrafts are particularly unlikely to assert their rights. </p> <p>This culture of acquiescence makes billions for the banking industry, and should be tackled by those who are supposed to represent consumers. </p> <p>It was therefore disappointing to see the latest Which? report on bank charges. Using examples similar to the one above, Which?, the journal of the Consumers' Association, points out how unfair most charges are, and call for banks to change their practices. </p> <p>However, the at best questionable legality of the charges is not dealt with. Nor is legal advice given on how those facing such a charge should respond. A call to banks to give customers \"a few days' grace\" is as robust as it gets. </p> <p>A profit-driven industry is hardly going to surrender a substantial proportion of what Which? estimates as \u00a33bn worth of fees annually from these charges just because it is asked to do so. </p> <p>The Consumers' Association has statutory powers to challenge unfair contract terms in the courts but rarely does so. It is not in any case clear that these charges are actually susceptible to challenge on that basis, as penalty clauses are governed by the case law rather than legislation. </p> <p>It is a shame that the Consumers' Association has not promised to back members who refuse to pay penalty or unauthorised overdraft charges. Public calls for banks to behave decently have little impact and are soon forgotten. Forcing them to either fight or surrender in thousands of individual cases would make their worst abuses unworkable. </p> <p>Richard Colbey is a barrister</p>",
  "The violin-maker Wilfred Saunders, who has died at the age of 76 from complications following heart surgery, was one of the last self-taught exponents of the English school of instrument-making, following names such as Arthur Richardson and Laurie Cocker. His solid woodworking background was a springboard to become a respected and successful maker, renowned particularly for his 164 violas. <p>Born in Nottingham, Saunders became an apprentice joiner at 14 at the firm of Abraham Pyatt. Then, at 16, when he started to play the violin, he decided to combine his interests and make himself a fiddle. He turned to a violin-maker's bible, Violin Making As It Was And Is by Edward Heron-Allen, a still-respected 19th-century source, and found he enjoyed this new skill so much that he turned to instrument-making full-time at 21. </p> <p>In those early days he made several instruments for the great viola-player Lionel Tertis, developing Arthur Richardson's design of the Tertis viola. This was a long and very wide instrument; the sound was enormous but the instrument was difficult to hold, and no longer has much currency. Another great source of encouragement at this time was the late Peter Schidlof, violist of the Amadeus Quartet. Saunders and Schidlof became firm friends and Schidlof helped Saunders create his own ideal model viola, which then changed little for the next 50 years. </p> <p>Saunders himself turned to playing the viola rather than the violin, and found playing even to a modest standard could be useful in the workshop. He favoured an instrument that was still wide, following on from the Tertis model, but with short corners (he maintained players always knocked the corners off with the bow), low arching, and Guarneri styling of the f-holes and scroll. </p> <p>He believed fervently in letting new instruments speak for themselves, and did not disguise them in any way with techniques such as antiquing the varnish. He thought today's makers should concentrate on new-looking instruments, rather than copying old models to the last measurement. He was not afraid to stand up and fight his corner, and often did just this, writing in trade magazines, or enjoying a good slanging correspondence which he would pursue until he won. </p> <p>Most of his instruments (in addition to the violas, he left 52 violins and five cellos) carried names, and were found in some of the finest orchestras across the world, including the Philharmonia, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and Israel Philharmonic. \"Edwina Currie\" adorned the label of one viola, an instrument eventually sold after much trouble to an unsuspecting Swiss amateur, unaware of its associations. </p> <p>A gifted teacher, Saunders taught evening classes, summer courses, and helped found the Newark School of Violin-Making in Nottinghamshire, a world-renowned centre of excellence, and now responsible for many of the fine makers who contribute to the extraordinarily strong state of the industry today. </p> <p>Saunders, who was awarded an OBE in 2003, is survived by his wife Janet (his 150th viola, \"Janet\", graced the coffin at the funeral), and his children Kay, Jacob, also an instrument-maker, and Harry. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Wilfred Saunders, violin-maker, born September 1 1927; died August 4 2004</p>",
  "It seems Americans like nothing more than seeing the Queen on the throne, but when it comes to George Bush sitting on his, they are altogether more squeamish. <p>Whether it's the political climate within which they live - just under two weeks before election day - or whether Alison Jackson's art is just a little too close to the truth, one thing is clear; they might get the joke, but not all of them like it. </p> <p>Jackson's first US solo show, entitled Election Year 2004, opened in New York on Thursday night showing a selection of new, and some not-so-new images for which she has become known. The grainy pieces, reminiscent of snatched paparazzi photographs show politicians, royalty and celebrities usually in compromising positions, yet ones that are not so far removed from reality that at first glance they might be real. </p> <p>However, all is not what it seems: Jackson uses look-alikes to portray all the celebrities and public figures. </p> <p>Visitors to her show yesterday were treated to Elton John being given an enema, a rather bored looking Mick Jagger hanging lacy black underwear next to a toddler's outfit on a suburban washing line, and the Queen sitting on the toilet reading a newspaper. </p> <p>There were lots of pictures with a George Bush lookalike - in one he is using Tony Blair as a footstool to get on his horse, in another he practises his shooting skills on images of Osama Bin Laden and Michael Moore (the latter the more often hit target). </p> <p>Yet it was President Bush sitting on the toilet reading a comic that caused the most consternation. </p> <p>Owen Clements, 22, a gallery assistant from New York said that he walked past the gallery most days and had seen the picture of Bush getting on his horse; he thought it was real until he visited the exhibition. He was uncomfortable with the image of Mr Bush in the bathroom, yet found the similar one of the Queen amusing. His friend Haley Cohen suggested this was accounted for by his US-centric viewpoint. </p> <p>He replied: \"It's not funny but Americans are so offended by him that it's an image that's probably not so far from the truth which makes them more depressing.\" </p> <p>Jackson, whose images appear weekly in Guardian Weekend magazine, has created the occasional storm. Her controversial work first gained notoriety in 1999 when she gave us an insight into another dimension - Princess Diana was 'pictured' with a mixed-race child, next to Dodi Fayed. </p> <p>But the outrage was thin on the ground in New York, where the big concern seemed to be more about getting rid of Mr Bush rather than getting angry at satirical photographs of him. </p> <p>Josh C Nusbaum, 29, from Long Island City, said: \"I don't care about seeing any more anti-Bush art, I'd rather just get him out of the White House. Perhaps I'd have had a different view if I saw this earlier in the year.\" </p> <p>Outside New York it could be a different story, said Leslie Tonkonow, 45, a gallery owner: \"I don't think it's something that would offend people in New York, but if it was shown in other parts of the country then it certainly could.\" </p> <p>After the exhibition Jackson was pleased with the response to her photographs. \"People really seemed to enjoy the work,\" she said. \"It was very bizarre to see people's reactions. One woman was laughing so hard she was almost on the floor, but maybe that's because Americans are more outspoken than British. You just wouldn't see that at a show in Britain.\" </p> <p>She was also surprised by how open-minded they were and explained how a group of elderly women had attended a preview. \"They were really having a good laugh ... they seemed to love the filthiness.\" </p>",
  "<p>It is cold in Leamington Spa. More of it enters the foyer of the Royal Spa Centre every time the doors open. I turn round just in time to see his back disappearing. He is wearing a blue mac and a dark trilby, and he takes the steps in the grudging way that old men do. Welcome to the Ken Dodd Happiness Tour. </p> <p>A famous place to die, Leamington. You will remember Betjeman's old lady, who died \"as the calm of a Leamington ev'ning drifted into the place\". But Ken Dodd doesn't die: an hour later, he strides on stage and takes Leamington by storm, just like he's taken, and will take, Stockport, Dudley, Mold, Birmingham, Blackpool, Tunbridge Wells and all the other towns and cities this year and the past 50 years. </p> <p>It is, though, a slow storm. Old Dodd doesn't die: he just goes on; and on. Tonight, as always, he will be on stage, by himself, for something like four hours. His audience will not see this Leamington evening again; it will be nearly 1am by the time they get out. </p> <p>And even then he doesn't want to let them go. He is still smiling, mugging, being winning: \"Happiness, happiness, the greatest gift that we possess ...\" The familiar anthem ends with his cry, \"Happiness - for you!\" and the third curtain finally extinguishes the smile. \"Half an hour longer than last year,\" says the manager. \"We don't keep it open this late for anyone else, but there'll never be another one like him, will there?\" </p> <p>All very puzzling. Surely variety is dead, killed by the couch and choice? Certainly none of the other attractions in Leamington - All Star Wrestling, 60s Night Out - has quite the Dodd cachet. The 60s night features the Fortunes (You've Got Your Troubles) and the Ivy League (Tossing And Turning), and promises \"a great night - just like it used to be\". But, at 76 going on 77, Ken predates just like it used to be. Ken wears funny hats and long coats, makes funny faces, tells jokes that depend on double entendre and sings songs that depend on the substitution of another word for \"bum\". Bum! How rude can you get? </p> <p>So what is Ken? The Last Great Something, for sure, but The Last Great What? After all, music hall was just about all up by the time he got started, 50 years ago this year. And there must be as many stand-up comics as ever. So what does he think he's doing, standing up here and there all these nights, putting his tickling stick between his legs when he's 76, telling jokes about his grandfather, who's supposed to be 83? Shouldn't he be at home in Knotty Ash with his scrapbook? And who's in the audience? Where do they come from? Why? </p> <p>Some of these questions are easier to answer than others. Dodd still sells out wherever he goes to an audience in which anybody under 50 stands out. They are people who've grown up with him and the idea of him, on stage, radio and television,people he affectionately accuses of all waiting for hip operations (the woman next to me has already had hers). He calls them silvertops, and men who wear beige trousers are called daring, a reference only they would understand. </p> <p>And the remarkable thing about these audiences is their stamina: a generational thing, more disciplined and biddable. Hardly anybody left in the interval, which came at 10.20pm, apart from one woman who was telling her mother, \"It's no good sitting there if they haven't got a loop, I can't keep repeating what he says.\" Ask people at the end if it hasn't gone on a bit long, and they look at you as if you're barmy. </p> <p>Why do they go? Well, nostalgia: some of Dodd's gags are like very old friends. There's a splendid one about men's legs getting lonely spending all day in the dark in trousers, which was noticed by Michael Billington in 1973, and the one about the woman who falls called Eileen Dover goes back to 1954, if not 1854. </p> <p>And there's more to it than the gags. Dodd conjures up times when sex was something comics could have all manner of fun hinting and winking at. So the old can escape back to the comfort of the old uncertainties, and the marginally younger, like me, can marvel at the skill, wit and sheer bravura of the double takes and entendres with which he skirts and nudges and indulges his almost extinct art in a world in which men and women live seaside-postcard lives of armed truce. </p> <p>But no leering. Dodd has an innocence entirely absent from Max Miller or John Osborne's dead-eyed archetype, Archie Rice. There are some who find the idea of him \"slightly creepy\", in a Benny Hill kind of way, but I can't see it, and neither can his audience. Dodd makes them laugh by calling himself Ken \"Chubby\" Dodd and promising to talk dirty: \"Sooty cobwebs!\" He can go on for five minutes about this man who's considering getting an artificial penis, and not once will he need anything so crass as a euphemism; and only in Dodd's world would the man come back from discussing it with his wife and announce they've decided on a new kitchen instead. </p> <p>Surely no other comic could hold an audience in thrall after midnight singing a lullaby to his ventriloquist's dummy. No leering, but every other expression available to the human face, including a giant smile that manages to draw focus to his eyes rather than his trademark teeth. It's a smile that shares the joke, the essential one about who's more daft, him up there doing all this or you down there watching it. </p> <p>It's the smile of a certain style of comic and it goes right back through the music halls to the jester and the mummer. Which Dodd knows all about, as he is a legendary student of comedy - the man with ledgers full of gags. Dodd can quote Bergson's theory that comedy is the perception of incongruity, or Leacock's that it is based on aggression and superiority, or Freud's that a laugh is a conservation of psychic humour; though, as he usually adds, none of them had to play the Glasgow Empire. (They asked Max Miller to play the Glasgow Empire: \"I'm a comic,\" he said, \"not a missionary.\") </p> <p>It has always seemed to me a little unrealistic to expect comics to behave in a conventional fashion, although the list of those vilified for not doing so is long and currently ends most notably with Michael Barrymore. Dodd does have form, his share of the comic clich\u00e9s of insecurity, of living in some private and other world; of coming alive only on stage. All of which was revealed when the worlds collided - when, in 1989, he faced tax fraud charges at Liverpool crown court involving several hundred thousand pounds stored in the attic, under the bed, in suitcases and offshore accounts. </p> <p>Dodd knew enough about the other world to insist on the services of George Carman. Enough, but not quite enough. He was acquitted, but not before Carman had laid out all the little quirks and privacies that would stress Dodd's detachment from the everyday and confirm that he was innocent in every sense. </p> <p>And so it became common knowledge that he still lived in his childhood home, from where his father had worked as a coalman when he wasn't losing bets and from where Dodd started selling door-to-door before selling stage-to-stage; that despite all the cash floating about, he was careful with it; that the house was packed with piles of old jokes, scripts, props, and the back garden \"like something out of Steptoe &amp; Son\". And that he had been trying, unsuccessfully, to have children with his long-time fiancee. </p> <p>There had been, too, the appearance on Radio 4's In The Psychiatrist's Chair two years earlier, when he'd claimed to have been \"too busy\" to marry his previous long-time fiancee or to have children. Reading all this odd Doddness again, I began to understand why he had become less keen on interviews. But I left a message anyway, and while I was going through some more stuff about the rarity and difficulty of interviewing Ken Dodd, the telephone rang. It was Ken Dodd. </p> <p>His voice was much deeper than it is on stage. He was amiable and talkative. An interview was possible, though there were a few things to sort out first. \"I don't do personal stuff,\" he warned. \"Why should that be of interest? I'm not interested in whether I wear my socks in bed, so why should anybody else be?\" </p> <p>But he did like biographies, he said. He'd just been reading Danny Kaye's. He was interested because he wanted to know how it worked, how Danny Kaye, why Danny Kaye, that was what comics wanted to know. \"It was a lot of rubbish, really, but one thing stuck out, those comic songs, that's Gilbert, isn't it? Gilbert and Sullivan. What a tremendous man Gilbert was ... \" And then, somehow, on to Lyons' Corner Houses and their waitresses, the Nippies. I said they'd brought them back a few years ago, and he said yes, but then the accountants decided it didn't make financial sense. (Accountants and tax: Dodd's obsession, referred to time and again on stage: \"Let me introduce myself. I'm Kenneth Arthur Dodd, artists' model and failed accountant.\") </p> <p>Then he told me I could get back in touch about the interview, gave me his number, and said goodbye. Only later did I realise there hadn't been one giggle. And, sadly, that it had been far too good to be true. All further messages went unanswered until someone else called to say that Dodd wouldn't do an interview without a veto on the piece. </p> <p>What did I miss, not talking to him? Well, I'd dearly like to know what The Last Great What he thinks he is; perhaps, too, I'd have got some of the vulnerability of the comic, still there, the joke prompts scribbled on the palm. And I might have got some more of the other Dodd, as with this, on the trial, to one of his last interviewers, Robert Chalmers of the Mail On Sunday, in 2001: \"It took three months of my life. Two years, if I'm truthful, worrying about it. And now it is so boring. It is so fucking boring.\" Ah, the swearing. Another fascinating thing about Ken \"Chubby\" Dodd is that he swears like an alternative comedian, but only offstage. </p> <p>It is cold in Rhyl. The rain is whipping in from the sea, at the back of the new Pavilion Theatre. The promenade is deserted. My thoughts go back to Oliver Hardy, on his last tour of Britain, in 1954, staring out of his hotel window in Cleethorpes and saying to Stan, \"What are we doing in a goddamn place like this?\" </p> <p>They pulled down the old Pavilion. The new one reminds me of something, but I can't quite place it. In the bar at the back, with a view down to the stage door, two women are waiting. A small convoy arrives. \"That's the Diddymen,\" says one of the women. Dodd's child performers, the ones whose routines would make WC Fields reach for a gun, a bottle, or both, but who are treated by Dodd without any nods or winks to the audience, except just after they've gone off, when he mock-whispers a gag they would have heard in the playground at least five years ago. </p> <p>But then, this is a comic who has always practised high sentiment without the safety net of irony. There's that lullaby to his dummy - clearly the child he has never had - and the songs, with the catch in the voice, such as Absent Friends: \"Before we close, let's think of those we've loved who can't be here ...\" You might not like it, but it's very brave, the mark of the artist. The Last Sentimentalist, then; or, in the kindest, strictest sense, The Last Sentimental Old Fool. </p> <p>A silver, Y-registered people carrier has parked at the stage door. \"That's a new one,\" one of the women says. \"His old one was red.\" A tall woman gets out and begins unpacking gear in a slightly harassed way. \"That's Anne,\" say the women. Anne Jones, Dodd's fiancee, factotum and support act; \"Miss Sibby Jones\" plays the piano and guitar and sings, bewigged and becostumed, almost as transformed as Dodd, who has climbed gingerly out of the people carrier and is walking to the door in the trilby and mac. </p> <p>\"We always come when he's here,\" says one of the women. \"For years.\" What is it she likes? \"He makes me cry. He doesn't make me laugh, he makes me cry. I've loved him ever since I first heard his records.\" How much longer does she think he will go on? \"He won't stop. He'll go on stage, like Tommy Cooper, and I wouldn't want to miss it,\" she says with a merry laugh. </p> <p>Make of that what you will - last year, a 35-year-old woman who fancied herself in love with Dodd was detained under the Mental Health Act after pushing burning rags through his letterbox and sending him a dead rat sprayed with perfume because she felt \"insulted and rejected\" by him. Not so funny; and no wonder comics can be a little strange. </p> <p>Curtain up. Backstage, apparently, Dodd had spent the previous hour grumbling, cursing and applying make-up so thick he calls it Fenceguard. Now, he bounced on, fluorescent with friendliness, quivering the tickling sticks, giving, coaxing, taking, doing what he calls his double act, going back to his days on the doorstep, now him and the audience, constantly addressed, women as \"Mrs\", men as \"Sir\", constantly warned about how long they'll be there, constantly joshed: \"When I first came on, I thought I was in outpatients ... Are you all right, Sir, you look like you're practising for jury service ... can someone hold a mirror to his mouth ... there's a word for what I'm doing now, struggling\" - until he's got them and doesn't let them go until, right at the end, he asks, \"Give in?\" </p> <p>The routine was much the same as in Leamington. There, in nearly four hours, he told the same gag twice just the once. Tonight, he doesn't. I watched a video of his performances from 1996, on sale in the foyer with the tickling sticks. Maybe there was slightly more energy then, and the wild hair has grown thinner, but it's clear he has enough material for twice as long, at least. Tonight he had a very good observational bit about the new health centres you get everywhere, how they disturb him, what with all that pine and brass handles on everything. And he has the description for the New Pavilion I couldn't quite come up with: \"Early Portakabin with a dash of mock Wimpey.\" </p> <p>But his grandad is still 83. And he was still coughing his way through just as he had in Leamington. A long-standing condition, never mentioned, unlike George Formby Sr, father of the more famous son, who used to tell the audience: \"I'm coughing better tonight!\" and they would laugh like drains, even though he was dying of tuberculosis. Comedy, eh? </p> <p>There was the same reluctant end, too, and the same puzzled looks from my neighbours when I wondered about the length. \"He's five minutes later than last year,\" said an usherette, \"but the interval ran over a bit.\" A reminder of the control beneath the apparent mayhem, Dodd's control: production, props, souvenirs, programmes, publicity. His two lugubrious, elderly musicians - \"All that's left of the Knotty Ash Philharmonic\" - have occasional effects to add, for example, but are always back on stage to add them in the middle of what seems an ad-libbed ramble. </p> <p>\"Nothing seems to have moved out of place in the six months since I first saw him at the Palladium,\" wrote Jonathan Miller 40 years ago. \"Every trip, pause and syncopation still comes exactly as it did. An iridescent show of artful dodging.\" Well, yes, but Billington's response was that technique can also thrill. </p> <p>Afterwards, I watched as Anne Jones repacked the people carrier in a slightly harassed way. In went the new poodle, replacement for the beloved but outlived Doodle. There was no one waiting. The show ended at 12.50am; at 2.15, Ken Dodd came out, walking slowly, in coat but without hat, and climbed gingerly back in. For a moment, I felt I was in one of those fairytales where someone watches something they're not meant to see, like who is really the Wizard of Oz. But it was probably overexposure to Diddymen, or the sea air. </p> <p>The people carrier pulled away again. It's 50 years since the start at the Nottingham Playhouse. Nothing special planned, just Blackpool, Ashton-under-Lyne, Crewe, Birmingham, Ipswich, Southport ... Happiness - for you!</p>",
  "<p>There is sparkle and wit in every element of a Forkbeard Fantasy production. Before the play begins, members of the audience drool over the playful foldout programmes and smile at the bizarre announcements encouraging us to take our seats. </p> <p>When we do, we enter Forkbeard's trademark territory, somewhere between theatre and film, pantomime and revered dramatic texts. This time it's Shakespeare: specifically, the old-time fad of filming silent adaptations of his work for the fledgling big screen. The Old Queen Theatre, ineffectually managed by Desmond Fairybreath (Tim Britton), is foundering as its audience forsakes live drama for the moving image. How live the drama has been is questionable: Dame Theodora Liverwort (Chris Britton) has been playing young Miranda in The Tempest for 53 years. </p> <p>So Fairybreath embraces film and the challenge of a silent Tempest. What follows is a madcap and inventive farce, self-referentially smart and highly silly. Characters move effortlessly between the realms of stage and screen in this darkly gothic tale that begins with a murder mystery and includes the theft of the Dame's voice. </p> <p>The richly textured production thoughtfully contemplates the battle between theatre and the young upstart that is cinema, but, in the second act, it simply revels in the visual possibilities of melding the two. The Tempest goes ahead, with celluloid and scenery merging so that you can't see where one ends and the other begins. Spellbound, you no longer care. It's still funny - the speedy tying-up of loose ends in Shakespeare is much lampooned - but the dreamy beauty of where two representational worlds meet is what stays with you long after. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ends tonight.

  "For a generation or more, it has been an article of faith, at least in Europe, that the nation state is in profound decline. The rise of globalisation, growing economic interdependence, the spread of new international organisations and the power of multinationals, not to mention the European Union itself, suggested that the future lay in new forms of global and regional governance. This was a delusion. The opposite is happening. Nation states will be the decisive players in global affairs over the next few decades. <p>So much is already clear with the United States. During the cold war, it behaved as a superpower constrained by its allies. Since 9/11 it has acted as Prometheus unbound, a nation state answerable to nobody but itself. Even if John Kerry is elected president, the US will not revert to its pre-9/11 behaviour. Kerry may emphasise the importance of allies, but the unilateralist instincts of the sole superpower will not be put back in the bottle. </p> <p>The weakness of Europe as a global player is also a reminder of the efficacy of the nation state. Economically, the EU remains a formidable force, rivalling the American economy. As a political player, though, it pales into insignificance in comparison. Unable to act with any decision even in the Balkans, its impotence has been all too transparent over Iraq, where the EU has essentially been reduced to its component parts, most graphically illustrated by the divergent roles of Britain and France. </p> <p>Whatever the lament about the dangers of a European superstate, it is inconceivable that this will change in the foreseeable future. Europe cannot act in concert outside of itself because it is divided into nation states whose interests remain distinct and divergent. The recently expanded union will serve only to make this more true, with the consequence that Europe will continue to be a weak and marginal player in global affairs. </p> <p>Even Iraq is a reminder of the importance of the nation state. Before the invasion, liberal imperialists liked to emphasise the limits of sovereignty, and to extol the virtues of imperial power acting to promote human rights and democracy, intervening in order to \"civilise the uncivilised\". They have gone a little quiet recently, for two reasons I would guess. Firstly, the US has behaved in the way that imperial powers always behave; it is an illusion to believe that it has ever seriously or systematically promoted democracy or human rights outside its own territory. And secondly, Iraq's resistance movement has reminded the world of the power of self-determination, of the resentment felt against rule by an overweening power from an alien culture and race. This was the lesson of the anti-colonial struggle, which somehow had been conveniently forgotten. National sovereignty and independent nation states matter, not just for countries such as Britain that have enjoyed this condition for centuries, but no less for those for which this is a historically novel experience. </p> <p>There is another sense, though, in which we are likely to see the resurgence of the nation state. The last century was dominated in its first half by medium-sized European nation states, and then subsequently by the rather larger US and Soviet Union. Of the world's presently five most populous countries - China, India, the US, Indonesia and Brazil (in descending order) - only the US has been a major global power during the course of the last half-century. This picture, however, is about to change; indeed, given the rise of China, it is already changing. </p> <p>Over the next half-century, the world is likely to assume a rather different shape. For the first time in the modern era, the world's two most populous countries (by a huge margin) will become major global players in their own right. It will mark the biggest watershed in global affairs since the birth of the modern nation state system. </p> <p>China and India, with well over a third of the world's population, will become major arbiters of all our futures. Compare that with the late 19th century, when Germany, France and Britain were the dominant powers, while accounting for only around 7% of the world's population (excluding their colonies, of course): or the US and the Soviet Union, which, by the end of the cold war, contained slightly over 10% of the world's population. The emergence of China and India as global powers will, in contrast to any previous period in modern history, introduce a rough and ready democracy to global affairs: the west, still the overwhelmingly dominant power in the world, represents only 17% of humanity, even on the most generous definition of the term. </p> <p>The arrival of China and India on the world scene will reinforce the importance of the nation state. They will dominate east Asia and south Asia respectively, which between them have well over half the world's population. Any trend in those regions towards the pooling of sovereignty along the lines of the EU, as in the case of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, will be secondary rather than predominant tendencies. The same can be said globally. India and China are, and will be, very different kinds of nation states from those that we are familiar with in the west. Not only are they far more populous - a novelty in its own right - they are also products of very different histories, cultures and races. </p> <p>Perhaps China provides the starkest illustration of the emergence of a new kind of nation state. Populous countries are often prone to fissure, the most recent example being the Soviet Union, while Indonesia is undoubtedly the least stable of the present top five. After Tiananmen Square in 1989, it was widely assumed in the west that the communist regime would fall, as it had in the Soviet Union, and that the country might even split. Neither happened. A crucial difference was that while the USSR was very multiracial, the Han account for the vast majority of Chinese. </p> <p>As Jared Diamond puts it in Guns, Germs and Steel: while five of the world's six most populous countries are creations of the past 200 years or so, China, is more than 2,000 years old. This is a nation state possessed of an extraordinary centripetal unity, its cohesion born of history and ethnicity. The fact that its population is almost twice that of North America and the EU combined provides an insight into its novelty as a nation state. </p> <p>None of this is to deny the importance of growing global integration, of which the EU is one example. Similarly, the accretion of a body of international law and the mushrooming of international institutions, such as the World Trade Organisation and the international criminal court (ICC), are intimations of a nascent sense of global community. But these tendencies have lulled many commentators into underestimating the continuing strength and importance of the nation state. </p> <p>The emergence of the US as a unilateral superpower was a rude reminder of where power is really located: indeed, it has sought to withdraw from, boycott or ignore the Kyoto treaty, the ICC and other bodies. The arrival of China as a superpower, and probably India a little further down the historical road, will only reinforce the underlying importance of the nation state. Nation states, not multilateral institutions, will be the decisive players of the 21st century. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Martin Jacques is a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics Asia Research Centre </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martinjacques1@aol.com\">martinjacques1@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<b> Drugs that don't rock Amadeus</b> <br> <p> The use of performance-enhancing drugs is not only a problem in athletics, according to Blair Tindall in the <b> New York Times</b> (October 17). The prevalence of beta blockers in the classical music world is also causing concern, she claimed. A form of cardiac medication, beta blockers are currently banned from some Olympic events, including shooting, because they prevent rapid heartbeat. Although legal, they have become controversial since Ruth Ann McClain lost her job teaching the flute at an adult college in Memphis after she recommended that nervous students who suffer from stage fright take them. </p> <p>\"The little secret in the classical music world - dirty or not - is that the drugs have become nearly ubiquitous,\" said Tindall. As the practice has spread, ethical questions have been raised: \"Are the drugs a godsend or a crutch? Is there something artificial about the music they help produce? Isn't anxiety a natural part of performance?\" </p> <p>Even though the use of beta blockers may be widespread, it is still \"largely secretive\". An unnamed woodwind player at a major orchestra told Tindall that beta blockers are \"like Viagra\" - \"no one admits to using it because of the implication of weakness\". </p> <p><b> The need for poetic licence</b><br> </p> <p> Last September, the US office of foreign assets control ruled that manuscripts from countries with which Washington has a trade embargo, such as Iran, cannot be edited, translated or published. \"This put Niloufar Talebi ... in an awkward position,\" wrote Jordan E Rosenfeld at <b> Alternet.org</b> (October 21), \"as her work is expressly designed around translating, editing and publishing Iranian poetry.\" </p> <p>Ms Talebi is director of the Translation Project, which endeavours \"to track the rich tradition of Persian poetry in diaspora since the 1979 revolution, now that so many Iranians reside outside of their home country\". The San Francisco resident said that she had become drawn to particular themes. \"I don't look for poetry of exile, but poetry in exile. I'm always searching for poetry that's more personal and has fresh themes or new ways of describing the day-to-day life of being a person who doesn'tnecessarily belong where he or she lives,\" said Ms Talebi. </p> <p>For her, the OFAC ruling undermines efforts to broaden Americans' horizons. \"In the post 9/11 climate leading to the US-Iraq war, Middle Eastern and central Asian countries have been mushed into one murky, Arabic-speaking, terrorist-threat-to-the-free-world zone,\" said Ms Talebi. \"Most Americans, even educated ones, are not aware of the vast differences in language, religion and government between Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan - a shortcoming that can be corrected by introducing literature in translation into the American culture.\" </p> <p><b> Putting the flair back in Mayfair</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Country Life</b> (October 21) went to town this week, with a special London issue. Its No 1 destination was Mayfair, which \"has become fashionable again\", said Mary Miers. After the second world war, \"grand drawing-rooms became boardrooms, and by 1960 about a third of Mayfair's total floor space was in offices\"; that trend has now reversed. Hefty price tags remain, but buildings that \"were once the homes of migrating aristocrats and the upper classes are now opening their doors to lawyers, bankers, Harley Street doctors, gallery owners, property developers and journalists - a close-knit community of middle-class professionals which, although still a minority, is rejuvenating the atmosphere of this West End enclave.\" </p> <p>Mayfair might have regained the air of a village, but it doesn't quite have your typical high street: \"The rarefied shopping parades of South Audley Street and Mount Street are home to such bespoke purveyors as Thomas Goode &amp; Co and Purdey, as well as ... art galleries, and London's finest tobaconnist.\" No Tesco? Relax: \"The lack of supermarkets and grocers is made up for by the proximity of Fortnum's and Selfridges.\"</p>",
  "When South Africa's worst mass murderer, Louis van Schoor, is released on parole from Fort Glamorgan prison on Friday, his 23-year-old daughter, Sabrina - who hired a hitman to slit her mother's throat - will remain in her cell in the same jail. She will be nearly middle-aged by the time she is reunited with her baby daughter. <p>The two Eastern Cape cases titled State v Van Schoor both turn on racism and violence, the enduring fault lines in South African life a decade after the country's first democratic election. Louis, a former policeman turned security guard, is thought to have shot 101 black people, killing 39 of them, in East London shortly before apartheid imploded in 1990. Eleven years later, Sabrina planned the murder of her mother, a prominent businesswoman in nearby Queenstown, on the grounds that Beverley van Schoor was a racist. </p> <p>When he was finally arrested, three and a half years after killing his first victim, van Schoor was hailed a hero by his community for protecting whites against black criminals. His supporters, who packed East London's high court for the trial in 1992, drove cars with bumper stickers of a heart pierced by two bullet holes and blood dripping from the wounds, and the words \"I Love Louis\". At her trial in June 2002, Sabrina's admirers - the same South Africans who had lived in fear of her father - crowded into the public gallery to commend her for striking a blow against racism by murdering her mother. Her lawyer, a black man, compared Sabrina's need to free herself from her mother's oppression to the plight of South Africa's freedom fighters under apartheid. </p> <p>The run-down port of East London, the scene of Louis van Schoor's carnage, is in the poorest and most politicised province of the country. It was here that Sabrina was born, the only daughter of Beverley, who had three sons from a previous marriage. The family lived on a smallholding on the outskirts of the city, but the marriage, stormy from the start, did not last. By the time Sabrina was four, her mother had fled to Queenstown, about 100 miles away, leaving the little girl to live with her maternal grandmother in East London while the boys went to a boarding school, so that Beverley could concentrate on establishing a new life. </p> <p>Sabrina saw her mother and father quite often until she was six, when her grandmother died and she moved to Beverley's suburban Queenstown home. Unusually tall and big-boned, like the father she idolised, and inclined to imitate van Schoor's macho manners, Sabrina was never close to her mother. Beverley, who made porcelain dolls as a hobby and, according to her sister, would have preferred a petite, pretty daughter, was by now a respected businesswoman. Focusing her energies on making money, she spent little time with Sabrina. It was to the family's black maid, Gladys Nontombi, that Sabrina turned for comfort. Although she went to stay with Louis and his third wife occasionally, the visits were ended by Beverley after Louis stopped sending child-support cheques. </p> <p>Sabrina, an ungainly 11-year-old when her father was arrested in 1991, was among the first children to attend newly racially integrated state schools. While many whites in East London at the time of van Schoor's trial believed he was a scapegoat for apartheid, few realised that his daughter was also being punished for his sins at Queenstown Girls' High. \"Black kids began to tease me, calling my dad 'kaffir killer'. I used to cry and didn't want to go to school,\" she told me when I visited her in Fort Glamorgan prison. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Sabrina - who as a child preferred to play in Gladys's dingy maid's quarters in the back yard of the van Schoors' home, rather than in Beverley's luxurious bedroom - chose mainly mixed-race friends in the classroom. But once Beverley, a pillar of Queenstown's white community, realised that Sabrina's boyfriends were also likely to be black or \"coloured\" (mixed race), she kept the teenager a virtual prisoner to prevent her socialising across the colour divide. \"She was just doing exactly what Mr Mandela said - making friends with people of different colours,\" said one of Sabrina's supporters at her trial. </p> <p>According to Sabrina's court testimony, the people who befriended her were hardly ever whites. She said she was molested during her childhood on three occasions by white men, one of them a boyfriend of Beverley's. When she told her family about the sexual abuse, they laughed and accused her of lying. A \"coloured\" man listened, however. This marked the start of a double life that was incomprehensible to the whites of Queenstown, a get-rich-quick outpost on the edge of the barren rural region known as the \"homelands\", where apartheid had tried to confine the black majority. </p> <p>After Sabrina had left school, she went to work for her mother's estate agency. At 20, she became pregnant by a non-white boyfriend. Beverley was horrified and stepped up the persecution. Having always felt unloved by her mother, Sabrina was now shunned by her half-brothers, too. \"They called me to a meeting and told me it was my last chance to have an abortion,\" Sabrina recalled in prison. \"They said if I went ahead and had the baby, my child would never play with theirs.\" </p> <p>Quarrelling daily with her mother, Sabrina took to locking herself in her bedroom and poring over the old press clippings of her father's trial. These featured gruesome inquest photographs of her father pointing to the sites of some of his murders, but they were the only pictures Sabrina had of him. Having convinced herself that her father was just doing his job when he murdered so many people, she never lost hope that he would be a good father to her. </p> <p>Sabrina wanted to leave Beverley's house and set up home alone with her baby. But she worked for - and was financially dependent upon - her mother, who threatened to fire her if she left and to gain custody of the six-month-old child on the grounds of maternal neglect. According to the psychologist who wrote a criminal profile on Sabrina for the judge at her trial, she consulted a social worker to check what rights Beverley had over her baby. </p> <p>As the mother/daughter relationship continued to deteriorate, Sabrina approached a 24-year-old man with a criminal record, Feza Mdutshane, and offered him 100,000 rands (around \u00a38,500) to kill her mother. Three weeks later, according to her confession, Sabrina let Mdutshane into the house, early on the morning of March 22 2002, took her baby from her mother and waited in her room as the killer attacked Beverley with a bread knife. In Mdutshane's account, Sabrina's only comment after the murder was, \"Are you sure she's dead?\" He told the judge at his trial that Sabrina returned to the room where her mother lay, stood over the body and found Beverley's mobile under the bed by calling it from her own phone. </p> <p>The killing led to a great deal of heart-searching. There was no case on record of premeditated matricide, even in crime-ravaged South Africa. Did the daughter simply copy her father's cold-blooded methods of achieving his ends? Or were Sabrina's attempts to escape racism through violence a symptom of South Africa's deepest problems? </p> <p>In the summer of 2002, Sabrina began her 25-year sentence at Fort Glamorgan. Her father, who had been convicted of seven murders and two attempted murders, had served 10 years of his sentence and, as it would turn out, had only two more years before his release. </p> <p>At his trial, van Schoor had claimed self-defence, despite the fact that most of his victims were unarmed and some were shot in the back. The murderer had evaded arrest for more than three years because apartheid's police, magistrates and inquest judges turned a blind eye to his killings. Even now, on the eve of his release, van Schoor is held in awe by many white East Londoners, who continue to see him as the man who protected them against criminals 12 years ago. </p> <p>It was left to two young journalists, who were initially unable to convince even their editors of van Schoor's guilt, to stick to their story until the society that had created van Schoor and supported his murders was finally forced to confront him. </p> <p>Patrick Goodenough, 24, of the Daily Dispatch, thought the allegations against van Schoor too outlandish to be true when he first heard them in 1989. The story had come to him from a local estate agent, who had overheard a burglar alarm salesman extolling the talents of one of his company's security guards. Explaining that the alarm system he was selling went off without the knowledge of intruders inside the premises, the salesman had boasted, \"Louis van Schoor has killed or wounded up to 100 burglars.\" </p> <p>A few weeks later, Goodenough read a report that two suspected burglars had been shot dead by an unidentified factory security guard. The journalist called the owner of the premises where the shootings had occurred and asked for the guard's name: it was Louis van Schoor. He still did not know how much of the estate agent's story to believe, but Goodenough had established that van Schoor had killed two men, although this was not unusual in his line of work. </p> <p>Ten days later, the trial of two housebreaking suspects gave Goodenough further evidence of van Schoor's licence to kill. The state alleged that the two - Thanduxolo Tshana, 28, and Simpiwe Tom, 16 - had been caught breaking into a clothing shop. Tom testified that he had been asleep on the pavement outside a bakery when van Schoor woke him and offered him a job. He accepted and they drove down East London's Oxford Street to Budget Buys. Inside the store, Tom told the magistrate, the guard shot him in the chest. When he fell, van Schoor fired three more shots straight at him. </p> <p>Tshana told the court that he was on his way to work at a beach-front hotel when van Schoor suddenly came out of an alley and opened fire. He collapsed and the guard hauled him into the courtyard behind the building. When van Schoor disappeared, Tshana dragged himself into an outdoor toilet. On his return, van Schoor tried to kick down the door, and then fired two shots through it. </p> <p>Tom and Tshana protested their innocence, but the magistrate dismissed them as liars and sent them to prison. However, an encounter between a young woman reporter and van Schoor during the tea break shortly before sentencing left Goodenough in no doubt that he was on to an important story. The reporter, Sally Shaw, related how she had decided to act girlie when she spoke to van Schoor outside the court: \"Your job must be quite dangerous. You must have shot quite a few people,\" she ventured. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" answered van Schoor, revealing his arrogance. \"Off the record, it must be about 100 now.\" </p> <p>The following day, Goodenough combed through the Dispatch's crime reports and found three more violent incidents involving van Schoor. Intrigued, he rang the police media officer, who declined to confirm van Schoor's involvement, but asked, \"Why are you after this guy? He does a lot of good work.\" </p> <p>Unable to confirm that the former policeman had killed at least three people and wounded four more, Goodenough discussed his suspicions about van Schoor with several security officials around the country, all of whom agreed that it was unusual for a guard to shoot that often over a short period. The reporter then wrote a story expressing concern about a local security guard with too many notches on his gun belt. Included in his piece was the claim van Schoor had made to Shaw. The Dispatch's editors spiked it. </p> <p>The next suspicious pointer was a call to Goodenough from an agitated local resident. He said he was calling the Dispatch as a last resort after failing to get the police to allow his domestic worker, Grace Sipolo, into the mortuary to confirm whether or not an 18-year-old who had been shot dead two nights earlier at Mike's Tavern was her missing son. Goodenough again telephoned the police media officer, who confirmed that there had been a shooting at the beach-front restaurant in which a security guard had killed two people. The spokesman refused to name the guard. Goodenough immediately called the restaurant's security company and asked to speak to van Schoor. </p> <p>Van Schoor returned the call a few minutes later, sounding cheerful when he admitted his involvement, but telling the journalist that any further comment would have to come from the police. Goodenough called Cambridge Road police station to find out how he could gain entry to its mortuary. The duty officer told him that, because it was a public holiday, his request would have to wait. He then let slip the fact that three people had been shot at Mike's Tavern, not two, the third having been wounded. </p> <p>After work that evening, Goodenough went to Frere Hospital and searched the wards for a gunshot victim. He found Siyabonga Tom - who had been admitted on the night of the shooting at Mike's Tavern - wired to life support machines in the intensive-care unit, too ill to receive visitors. In the meantime, Grace Sipolo was finally admitted to the mortuary where she found her son, Steki, who had died from bullet wounds to the upper arm and chest. </p> <p>Goodenough eventually interviewed Siyabonga in a general ward. He and two friends, Steki Sipolo and a youth he knew only as Patrick, had been looking for food in rubbish bins outside Mike's Tavern. Patrick kept watch while Sipolo, who had found the back door unlocked, went into the kitchen. Suddenly, a gunshot rang out. The two ducked and scurried into hiding places. Siyabonga saw a tall white man with a long beard coming over the wall with a torch in one hand and a pistol in the other. </p> <p>Van Schoor found Sipolo hiding behind the fridge and dragged the screaming youth out by his leg. \"I apologise, my baas, please don't shoot me, rather call the police,\" Sipolo begged. Two shots rang out. Sipolo fell silent. Van Schoor swung round and saw Siyabonga inside a large rubbish bin, also begging not to be shot. The security guard grabbed him and shot him in the back at point-blank range. As he fell, Siyabonga saw van Schoor climbing back over the wall, speaking into his walkie-talkie. </p> <p>Goodenough was about to write a story based on his interview at Siyabonga's hospital bedside. He was interrupted by his news editor, who informed him that the youth had been charged with housebreaking. The case was now sub judice, meaning the newspaper could not report Siyabonga's claims until he repeated them in court. Frustrated and annoyed, the journalist decided to approach a human rights organisation, the Black Sash, for a lawyer to represent Siyabonga. </p> <p>The victims were piling up: at least five dead and seven wounded in the six weeks since Goodenough had embarked on his investigation. He tried again to get the story published, but his editors again spiked it. When Goodenough showed them the charges of attempted murder filed against van Schoor by the lawyer working with the Black Sash, they referred to the sub judice rule again. The next day, Goodenough wrote a brief factual report stating that police had confirmed that they were investigating two charges of attempted murder against a security guard named Sybrand \"Louis\" van Schoor. To his fury, even this bland story was rejected by his newspaper at a time when van Schoor was boasting on the phone to him: \"I'm in full production ... full production.\" </p> <p>A week later, Goodenough was tipped off by a court interpreter that van Schoor was about to appear before an inquest into the death of a child, Liefie Peters, who had been shot dead at the Esplanade Wimpy Bar in 1988. He rushed to the court to find that van Schoor had just left and the case had been postponed. In the inquest docket, he found a statement by a youth called John Swartbooi. The teenager said that he and Peters had broken into the Wimpy to steal money. After entering through a smashed window, they saw a white man answering van Schoor's description peering through the front window. They ran to hide in a toilet. Huddled together, barely breathing, they watched the huge figure loom through the broken glass, his greasy hair and wild beard visible in the dim glow of a street lamp. Then he spotted them and fired. Seven shots. Then van Schoor calmly radioed the police. </p> <p>Goodenough, knowing that six people had been killed and nine wounded by van Schoor, was losing patience with the Daily Dispatch - ironically the newspaper that had been hailed all over the world during the 1970s for fearlessly championing black consciousness activist Steve Biko. Goodenough approached a colleague, 21-year-old Dominic Jones, to help him discover if van Schoor had killed as many people as he claimed. \"There was only one way to find out,\" says Jones. \"I went to the courts and, after the usual stonewalling from officials, started going through the inquest files.\" Many hours later, he left with the names of 22 people who had been killed by van Schoor. \"The evidence of van Schoor's bloody reign had been there all the time, gathering dust,\" he says. \"It seemed incredible that so many were dead and yet no one had ever raised the alarm.\" </p> <p>When Jones gave him the list of inquest victims, Goodenough made a final attempt to publish details of van Schoor's murders in the Dispatch. His report was rejected. That weekend, the Natal-based Sunday Tribune ran the story on its front page, alongside dramatic pictures of van Schoor copied from the inquest files. </p> <p>The public had at last been informed of van Schoor's death patrols. Police officers nationwide were suddenly bombarded with outraged inquiries. The story sparked what police headquarters in Pretoria called \"a general polemic\". An opposition MP demanded to know from the minister of justice how it was possible for the inquest magistrates in East London summarily to close 35 cases in which one man had been implicated in each killing, without a single hearing taking place. </p> <p>Van Schoor's actions became the subject of intense public and media interest, both at home and abroad. Lawyers called for a revision of Section 49 of the Criminal Procedures Act which, in effect, permitted the killing of a child running away with a stolen apple. At a time when the police spokesman on the matter was still referring to van Schoor as \"just a bloody efficient security guard\", the disclosures put under the spotlight the criminal justice system and its attempts to protect van Schoor. </p> <p>The Black Sash's East London office was inundated with information, mainly from township dwellers relating near-death experiences with van Schoor, but also from doctors, policemen and members of the van Schoor family. A massive dossier began to accumulate against the killer who ran across roofs and entered dark buildings with his 9mm Parabellum clasped in both hands, and casually admitted in court documents that he had fired seven, eight, even 10 shots at a time. </p> <p>To everyone's surprise, van Schoor himself contributed to the dragnet that was closing in around him after he heard on the radio that investigators believed he had killed at least 34 people. At around midnight, three days after shooting dead his latest - and last - victim, van Schoor telephoned Jones to set the record straight. \"Number 39, pal,\" was all he said to the reporter. </p> <p>The public prosecutors who eventually prepared the case against van Schoor launched the biggest investigation the country had ever seen. But the criminal justice system, having colluded with van Schoor, had covered his tracks, so prosecutors found evidence to charge him with only 19 counts of murder and 21 of attempted murder. </p> <p>In April 1992, Mr Justice Lionel Melunsky found van Schoor guilty of seven murders and two attempted murders. Sentencing him to a total of 91 years - various sentences to run concurrently so that he was expected to serve at most 20 years - the judge said that van Schoor had been given the benefit of the doubt, even when the court was not convinced that he was telling the truth, and that he was lucky to get off so lightly. </p> <p>A model prisoner, according to his warders at Fort Glamorgan, van Schoor is coming out on parole after serving only 12 years. He owes his good fortune partly to a sentence reduction given to prisoners nationwide by then-president Nelson Mandela on his 80th birthday. Deflecting questions about his murders on East London's streets, he explains that he has found God in prison and is now a reformed character. </p> <p>The sense of physical power you get on meeting van Schoor is scary. He shakes hands with such force that you feel your teeth might chatter. He is imposing at 6ft 2in, and incongruously confident in the slightly ridiculous orange pyjama-like prison outfit. \"I have achieved everything I ever wanted to achieve in life,\" he says enigmatically. \"I have nothing left to prove.\" </p> <p>Brought to Sabrina's trial in shackles two years ago to assist in her defence, van Schoor chose instead to plead his own case for parole. He claimed he needed to be freed to look after Sabrina's baby while she was in prison serving at least two-thirds of her 25-year sentence. Sabrina spoke in support of her father's plea to adopt her daughter. She said that even if evidence were produced to prove that her father had assaulted her mother during their marriage, she would still be happy if he looked after her baby. \"I don't believe he would assault my child,\" Sabrina told the judge. \"She is his first grandchild.\" </p> <p>As van Schoor prepares for his release next week, one of his last tasks in prison may be to break the news to Sabrina that he plans to live in faraway Cape Town after he marries his fiancee, a lawyer, who will be his fifth wife. Although Sabrina has been permitted fortnightly visits from her father, she continues to believe that he intends to settle in East London in order to bring her daughter to visit her every week during the remainder of her sentence. </p> <p>Dressed in prison-issue denim with her hair in stylish braids, Sabrina says she is praying that her father will be able to adopt her child. Although the foster mother brings the pretty three-year-old to Fort Glamorgan to visit her biological mother from time to time, Sabrina says: \"I know [the child] is happy where she is, but she belongs with us. Family is family.\" </p> <p>It is unlikely that the state, which gained custody of the child after Sabrina's half-brothers rejected her baby, would allow van Schoor to adopt his \"coloured\" granddaughter, even if he could prove that he sincerely wished to do so. \"The idea is grotesque,\" says a social worker who does not want to be named. The little girl lives happily in an idyllic mountain hamlet not far from the sites of her grandfather's multiple murders and her mother's matricide. Adored by the foster mother she calls Mummy, the youngest van Schoor is growing up in a community that has embraced her as neither black nor white </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Heidi Holland is currently writing a book about Sabrina van Schoor's life.</p>",

A slightly schmaltzy mix of ET and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.</p> <p><strong>Unhook The Stars</strong> (Nick Cassavetes, 1996) <br>10.10pm, BBC2</p> <p>Cassavetes, son of the great John, has mum on his side in his impressive directing and writing debut. She is Gena Rowlands, who stars as Mildred, an elderly woman whose life takes an unexpected turn when she meets drunken Monica (Marisa Tomei) and her six-year-old son JJ (Jake Lloyd). Gerard Depardieu as a big ol' Canadian trucker is a slightly peculiar presence, but it's a sensitive and moving portrait.</p> <p><strong>Michael Collins</strong> (Neil Jordan, 1996) <br>1am, ITV1</p> <p>This stirring account of the Republican hero spans the period from the 1916 Easter uprising to his assassination in 1922, impressively melding emotional and political imperatives along the way. It's a vivid but balanced picture of a country in painful ferment, superbly photographed by Chris Menges, and full of excellent performances, including Liam Neeson as Collins, Alan Rickman as De Valera, Stephen Rea the dubious Ned Broy and Julia Roberts as Kitty Kiernan.</p> <p><strong>Scum</strong> (Alan Clarke, 1979) <br>1.30am, C4</p> <p>This grim picture of borstal life - which started out as a TV play until the BBC turned it down - packs a real punch. And kick, and head-butt. Roy Minton's story of a young offender brutally fighting his way to supremacy inside makes an angry case for reform, and there are uncompromising turns from Ray Winstone and Phil Daniels.</p> <p><strong>Sunday October 24</strong> </p> <p><strong>Red River</strong> (Howard Hawks, 1948) <br>2.15pm, ITV1</p> <p>One of the great westerns, an epic, oedipal tale acted out on the cattle trail. John Wayne's Dunson is an old westerner clinging to harsh, outmoded values; only a final, inevitable confrontation with his adopted son, Matt (Montgomery Clift) offers hope of redemption.</p> <p><strong>Star Trek: Insurrection</strong> (Jonathan Frakes, 1998) <br>7.10pm, Five</p> <p>After the dark pleasures of First Contact this ninth outing for the bold Trekkers seems a little tame. On a planet of eternal youth, Patrick Stewart's Captain Picard is forced to disobey Federation rules in order to save the peace-loving Ba'kus from ethnic cleansing by F Murray Abraham's oppressive So'na race. The thin plot barely makes warp-factor two, but it's an enjoyable voyage.</p> <p><strong>What's Love Got To Do With It?</strong> (Brian Gibson, 1993) <br>10.55pm, BBC1</p> <p>A gutsy biopic of Tina Turner, played with belting power by Angela Bassett. It's based on the soul singer's autobiography and she was on hand throughout the shooting, so it's very Tina-friendly. Having said that, there's much to admire in her rise to the top, weathering the storm that was her abusive husband Ike (Laurence Fishburne) along the way; and it pulls no punches with the domestic violence. Great songs too.</p> <p><strong>Predator</strong> (John McTiernan, 1987) <br>9pm, Five</p> <p>Gruesome but effective sci-fi adventure with Schwarzenegger leading a platoon of highly trained, highly unlikable fighters on a rescue mission in a South American jungle. But soon it is they who need rescuing, when they encounter an invisible alien who proceeds to slaughter them horribly, one by one, until the creature (Kevin Peter Hall) is goaded into showing itself and challenging Arnie to single combat: big mistake. The Predator, of course, is on the big screen now in Predator Vs Alien - hence this creative bit of scheduling ...</p> <p><strong>Alien 3</strong> (David Fincher, 1992) <br>11.10pm, Five</p> <p>Once more into those dark tunnels for Sigourney Weaver in this exceptionally gloomy chapter of the great SF horror saga. Her battle-weary Ripley crashlands on a planet colonised by convicts. Her surrogate family, and with them hope, are dead, but one creature is very much alive and stirring in her belly. Charles Dance as the resident doctor offers a little TLC until, her head shaven as if in preparation for execution, she rises to the final challenge. Attagirl, Ripley.</p> <p><strong>Monday October 25</strong></p> <p><strong>The Old Dark House</strong> (James Whale, 1932) <br>11.20pm, BBC2</p> <p>A classic comedy of horrors: the plot, from a JB Priestley novel and concerning a group of travellers obliged to spend the night with the menacing denizens of a creaky old mansion, has reappeared endlessly since. And Whale gathered a cast to die for: Boris Karloff, Charles Laughton and Raymond Massey.</p> <p><strong>The Lightship</strong> (Jerzy Skolimowski, 1985) <br>12.05am, BBC1</p> <p>Psychotic Robert Duvall and his ugly escapee henchmen hijack a lightship off the Norfolk, Virginia coast, but the captain is impassive Klaus Maria Brandauer and the baddies have run their flag up the wrong pole. Good, glowering performances and a suspenseful clash of good and evil.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday October 26</strong></p> <p><strong>Sleep, My Love</strong> (Douglas Sirk, 1948) <br>1.25pm, BBC2</p> <p>From the opening scene in which Claudette Colbert awakes on a New York-to-Boston train, not knowing how she got there, this is a tense and unsettling thriller that rarely loses the pace. The sad fact is, she's being drugged into mental breakdown by her no-good husband Don Ameche, so he can grab her money and run.</p> <p><strong>New York, New York</strong> (Martin Scorsese, 1977) <br>11pm, ITV1</p> <p>Scorsese goes on the town with a fine updating of MGM musical myths. So instead of debonair Gene Kelly you get Robert De Niro's charming, angsty saxophonist in harrowing love with singer Liza Minnelli. It looks and sounds great, with jazzy George Auld dubbing for De Niro; and it carries a real emotional charge.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday October 27</strong></p> <p><strong>The Way To The Stars</strong> (Anthony Asquith, 1945) <br>1.15pm, C4</p> <p>Second world war drama from the school of modest heroism, a detailed, low-key account of crew and groundstaff at an RAF bomber station in the midlands. The acute screenplay encompasses the ordinary and the tragic, and there are sterling, stiff-upper-lipped performances all round.</p> <p><strong>Die Another Day</strong> (Lee Tamahori, 2002) <br>9pm, ITV1</p> <p>Director Tamahori brings a muscly conviction to this 20th Bond adventure, even if the familiarly preposterous plot (involving North Koreans and Toby Stephens' abrasive megalomaniac, Gustav Graves) is much the same as the previous 19. Pierce Brosnan brings a steeliness to 007 unseen since the days of Connery, and Halle Berry as his tough and sexy sidekick Jinx deserves a movie of her own.</p> <p><strong>The Bodyguard</strong> (Mick Jackson, 1992) <br>9pm, Five</p> <p>Glossy, well-produced romantic thriller in which only the turgid theme song lingers - unwanted - in the mind. Kevin Costner plays a minder, ex-CIA, looking out for pop star Whitney Houston. The formulaic plot has the couple falling in love and hiding out in a rural retreat where he can lay down honest country values. Watchable, undemanding stuff.</p> <p><strong>Thursday October 28</strong></p> <p><strong>Carrington VC</strong> (Anthony Asquith, 1954) <br>1.15pm, C4</p> <p>The courtmartial of an army major on a trumped-up fraud charge. David Niven is his usual charming self as the unhappy Carrington, betrayed by neurotic wife, Margaret Leighton, and shifty superior Allan Cuthbertson, in an engrossing drama.</p> <p><strong>Six Days, Seven Nights</strong> (Ivan Reitman, 1998) <br>8pm, Five</p> <p>Harrison Ford stars in light comedy mode as a drunken pilot who crashlands on a remote South Pacific island with Manhattan magazine editor Anne Heche. So far, so contrived; and while their respective partners (Jacqueline Obradors, David Schwimmer) find solace together, Reitman has the marooned pair dunked in a sub-Romancing The Stone adventure. Despite the age gap, however, Ford and Heche make a winning couple.</p> <p><strong>8mm</strong> (Joel Schumacher, 1999) <br>10pm, C4</p> <p>A low-life wallow from Schumacher, with Nicolas Cage in world-weary private investigator mode, hired by a widow to find out whether the snuff movie found among her dead husband's possessions is the real thing. The trail through the gutter of LA's underworld is long and sludgy.</p> <p><strong>Friday October 29</strong></p> <p><strong>The Invisible Man</strong> (James Whale, 1933) <br>11.20am, BBC2</p> <p>Another intelligent, creepy horror story from the director of the classic Frankenstein. Claude Rains makes a singular debut - we don't glimpse his face until the very end - as the scientist whose self-experimentation makes him first invisible, then a mad murderer.</p> <p><strong>South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut</strong> (Trey Parker, 1999) <br>10.40pm, C4</p> <p>Fans of Trey Parker and Matt Stone's cheerfully offensive TV cartoon series will love this big-screen spin-off. The kids - Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman - sneak into a showing of the adult movie Asses Of Fire and come out with an extended vocabulary which they naturally pass on to their friends. Soon parents are united in moral outrage, and a war with Canada is on the cards. With a topical subplot involving Satan and Saddam Hussein, this is an outrageous, often hilarious satirical attack on censorship.</p> <p><strong>Crimes And Misdemeanours</strong> (Woody Allen, 1989) <br>2.35am, Five</p> <p>A film of two loosely-linked halves. Martin Landau plays an eye surgeon who coldly hires a hitman to deal with his troublesome mistress (Anjelica Huston); then Allen plays a TV producer who, for the love of Mia Farrow (those were the days) agrees to make a film about his insufferably successful brother-in-law and purveyor of sitcoms (Alan Alda, excruciatingly good). Intelligent and well acted, it seems finally over-ambitious.</p>",
  "A teenager accused of murdering a 10-year-old girl at a Christmas party denied killing her when he gave evidence for the first time yesterday. <p>Paul Smith, 18, was challenged several times by the prosecution at Nottingham crown court.</p> <p>He admitted he had been in the bedroom of the family house in Normanton, Nottinghamshire, where Rosie May Storrie was later discovered. He said he had been to look at a CD earlier in the evening but denied holding down and suffocating the girl, a keen ballet dancer.</p> <p>The prosecution alleges that Rosie May, who had gone to the party with her parents on December 28 last year, was suffocated and stripped half naked by Mr Smith after a playful chase turned to tragedy.</p> <p>Mr Smith told the jury that he might have left a can of Guinness in the room where she was found, but he was not with her when she died.</p> <p>The court has been told that Rosie May, of Bottesford, Leicestershire, was killed in an upstairs bedroom while adults chatted down below.</p> <p>Paul Mann QC, prosecuting, asked Mr Smith if he was worried when he realised he had left the Guinness can behind in the room.</p> <p>\"You were worried because you knew that you had smothered Rosie May,\" Mr Mann said.</p> <p>\"No,\" the teenager replied.</p> <p>\"She had made fun of you, hadn't she?\"</p> <p>\"No.\"</p> <p>\"You can't cope with people making fun of you?\" said Mr Mann.</p> <p>He replied: \"I can. I have done it for 11 years at school.\"</p> <p>Challenging him once more, Mr Mann said: \"You lost control, didn't you? You lost your temper with Rosie May and all of a sudden you realised you had left something behind that might link you to the crime, don't you?\"</p> <p>Mr Smith replied: \"No, sir.\"</p> <p>The jury has heard evidence from an 11-year-old boy who said he had seen Mr Smith on the landing with Rosie May moments before she was killed.</p> <p>\"He saw you on the landing?\" Mr Mann asked.</p> <p>\"He didn't, no, and he has already said that he lied,\" said Mr Smith. \"I was never there and I was never drinking Guinness.</p> <p>Mr Mann asked: \"Rosie had taken that can out of your hand and was running along the landing with it, wasn't she?\"</p> <p>He replied: \"I would not give alcohol to a young child of that age.\"</p> <p>Mr Mann continued: \"What I am suggesting is that she, rather cheekily, took it from you and it was the sound of you and Rosie mucking around on the landing that drew [the 11-year-old boy] out of his bedroom. You chased her to the bedroom, didn't you?\"</p> <p>\"No, sir.\"</p> <p>Mr Smith also denied making a sexual comment earlier that evening while sitting next to Rosie May on the computer downstairs. He said: \"I do not feel sexually aroused, if that is your question, by young girls.\"</p> <p>He told the court DNA found under his fingernails matching that of the dead girl must have come from his mother, who tried to resuscitate her.</p> <p>Frances Oldham QC, defending Mr Smith, told the jury: \"When you hear from him and listen to him, you may notice an unusual demeanour.</p> <p>\"You may perceive a monotone and an apparent lack of emotion. What you have to bear in mind is that Paul Smith suffers from a condition known as Asperger's Syndrome and it is a form of autism. It forms no part of his defence to the charge, which is 'whoever was responsible for the death of Rosie Storrie, it was not me'. But his condition does affect the way in which he presents himself.\"</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "I broke up with my partner of 10 years when I was 36, and realised last week that the second anniversary of our divorce had passed by without my noticing. It's testament to what a positive and liberating experience being single in my late 30s has been, though it didn't feel that way at first. <p>Break up with someone in your 20s and people say things such as \"plenty more fish in the sea\" or, more helpfully, \"I never liked him anyway, let's get drunk.\" The prevailing attitude is that you'll be fine, someone better will come along, and until they do, let's party. But break up with someone in your 30s or 40s and there's a great deal of anxious gritting of teeth. </p> <p>\"I'm so sorry,\" people kept saying, in much the same tone they use when someone's just died. The boozy night out with the girls to drown my sorrows involved talking about child care and decorating, rather than boys and dating, before finishing at 10pm because their babysitters needed a lift home. More to the point, I hadn't so much as snogged a virtual stranger, let alone bared my body to them, for at least 10 years, so let's just say I didn't leap straight back on the dating bandwagon. </p> <p>Instead, I spent time reflecting on what I wanted next, from every aspect of my life - career as well as relationships. I've quit my day job and am working on that book I've always talked about. Where, in my 20s, I moved on to new relationships without thinking about much beyond how cute he was, now I'm thinking seriously about the kind of man who makes me happy - creative, adventurous and gregarious, if you're thinking of applying. </p> <p>I've re-evaluated how I behave in a relationship, too, and have found that I can give the man in my life more space but share more of myself at the same time. I don't feel threatened when he's away and am happy to lay my heart on the line when the moment takes me. It's less about defending the relationship and more about enjoying it. </p> <p>Being older also means that, after the odd hissy argument in public places when we first split, my ex and I are still good friends. Having been together for 10 years, he understands me better than most and still celebrates my successes and consoles me if I fail. He's discovering new passions, too. The rare occasions he cooked used to lead to a massive mess and relationship-busting stress. Now that I'm no longer lording over his kitchen, he grows herbs on his windowsill, buys recipe books and has cooked me more meals than he ever did when we were together. </p> <p>I'd never lived alone before we split up so moving into my own place was exciting and scary. It's a clich\u00e9, but the first time I found a huge spider in the bath, the options were: call work and tell them I won't be in because I'm waiting for pest control; ask the guy upstairs to sort it out; call my ex and explain it's part of the divorce settlement that he sort it out; and, finally, sort it out myself. Which is what I did. </p> <p>That's not to say there haven't been difficult times when being single feels more like EastEnders than Friends. It's true, breaking up is hard to do. But if it happens to you and your friends get all funereal, tell them to lighten up. It might just be the start of something great - and in the meantime, let's party.</p>",
  "<p>A friend, the Canadian writer Jonathan Goldstein, used to work in telemarketing. \"As soon as we hung up,\" he says, \"the computer would automatically dial the next number: 'Hi, my name is Jonathan. I wanted to know if you're interested in ... '\" He did this job for 10 years: 200 calls a day. A few weeks ago, he got home and found a message on his answerphone. He plays it to me. \"Hello?\" says a man's voice. There are a few seconds of silence. You can hear the background buzz of a busy telemarketing office. Then the man inhales and he hangs up. \"When the telemarketer realised there was no one to pitch to,\" Jonathan explains, \"he stopped himself. But listen to that pause between the 'hello' and the hang-up. I recognise that pause. He's stealing a moment. He's taking shelter in those few seconds before he hits the hang-up button and the onslaught of automatically dialled numbers begins anew.\" </p> <p>Yesterday, I got a call from an O2 telemarketer. \"I've got some urgent information to tell you about your account,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Is this really urgent,\" I replied brusquely, \"or are you just reeling me in to sell me something?\" </p> <p>There was a short silence. \"It is really urgent,\" he said unsurely. \"What is your mother's maiden name?\" I told him. \"Congratulations!\" he said. \"You are entitled to a free phone upgrade.\" </p> <p>\"You misled me!\" I said. He sounded startled. Then I added, my words dripping with sarcasm, \"I will accept your congratulations and I will hang up now.\" </p> <p>\"But ...\" he said. </p> <p>\"I know there's a catch,\" I said bitterly. I hung up. </p> <p>Today, a new phone arrives. It has a camera and a colour screen. There are no strings attached. I have no idea who I should apologise to.</p>",
  "<p>I am at a red light, idling in neutral, when I start to feel the uncomfortable sensation of being watched. The people in the car next to me are looking and pointing. As pedestrians cross the road in front, some are staring so intently that they stumble and barge headlong into lamp-posts and other shoppers. On the pavements either side, small knots of people gather to watch and pass comment, nudging each other and exchanging views on the intriguing spectacle before them. </p> <p>Just as any other middlingly neurotic person would do in similar circumstances, my first instinct is to check in the mirror for stray nasal secretions. Then my hair - do I look more than averagely mad today? Have I left bags of groceries on the roof of the car, got my skirt snarled up in the door, or inadvertently run over a small animal/child/old person and been driving along unaware of the mess spattered all over the radiator? </p> <p>I am just about to get out and check for anything that might justify this amount of attention when I remember, with some regret, that I am not driving my usual anonymous old wreck. Today, I am behind the wheel of our other car, which has, during the two years we have owned it, turned out to be easily the most conspicuous vehicle in the whole of East Anglia, if not the UK, and even, I would venture, the world. When we took delivery of our shiny new Renault Avantime, it appeared, at the time, no more outlandishly different than, say, a Fiat Multipla. Granted, as a considerably bulked-up version of a M\u00e9gane, its backside looked preposterously big - an effect possibly exaggerated by its vivid electric blue and silver paint job - but, we reasoned, just as the Multipla would eventually stop being derided as an ill-conceived cross-fertilisation of airport shuttle-bus and cosmetically challenged dolphin, so our Avantime would, in time, blend in and become accepted as just another roomy, serviceable family car. </p> <p>But acceptance comes only with familiarity, and where the Multipla sold well and is now a common sight on the roads, these days prompting only minor hilarity rather than full-blown scorn, the Avantime didn't shift at all. It turned out to be the difficult middle sibling in the nicely spoken Renault family, the mad one, the freak, the one that upsets the relatives and refuses to toe the crowd-pleasing line like the rest of the gang. Its crime? The existence of just two doors. </p> <p>To us, the two-door thing has not proved much of an inconvenience, but I do not speak for the majority of the car-buying public. I can only imagine the gasps of disbelief that reverberated through the people carrier market when they were told about the Avantime's eccentricity on the door front. These are people for whom, after boot space and somewhere to put cups, the right number of doors really matters. </p> <p>Anyway, it was the dearth of doors in a car priced at this level and pitched at the family market that, among other setbacks, sealed the Avantime's fate, leading to its swift decommission and leaving just 200-plus in the country. That we own one of these futuristic oddities - part milk float, part space shuttle, part five-year-old's drawing of what a 22nd-century car/boat/plane hybrid might look like - is something of which we are reminded on a daily basis. It literally stops people in their tracks. And not just here in our sleepy Suffolk village, where the last noteworthy thing to travel down the main road was a hay wagon circa 1465. </p> <p>Broadly speaking, children are enthralled by it and adults are suspicious, dismissive or incredulous, with the exception of the steward on our Eurotunnel crossing last summer, who was unreservedly complimentary and, he gushed, honoured to have our car in his custody. But honoured is one thing, titillated is another entirely. When he started stroking it and talking in a faintly disturbing manner about its fabulous rear end, Calais terminal couldn't come into view soon enough. </p> <p>Of course, all this attention is very welcome if you're a vehicular exhibitionist, but I am not. I drive the Avantime only under duress, or if I've run out of petrol. For all sorts of reasons to do with bad hair, erratic driving, episodic road rage and general misanthropy, I feel it is preferable to patrol the streets unnoticed. But there is no hiding in the Avantime. Even the shortest, most routine trip out turns into an event. The chances of popping into town cloaked in invisibility are virtually nil. Instead of blending into the crowd, I may as well be Britney Spears driving topless down the high street in a pink Mr Whippy van. </p> <p>But that isn't to say I won't defend the car against its many critics. When people say it's ugly, I am as loyal as a doting new mother defending the wrinkled pink potato-head she cradles in her arms. I have also developed a nerdish, and frankly worrying, desire to track down and bond with other Avantime owners, with a view, perhaps, to starting some sort of club. I concede that this is hardly the behaviour of one who craves anonymity, but perhaps some of that electric-blue showmanship is beginning to rub off.</p>",

  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I was brought up in Argentina and have been to Patagonia twice (well, to part of it since it is huge). It's hard to reply to your questions because it will depend on where you want to start your journey. I assume you are planning to ride on the Andes side of Patagonia. There are some areas that are much more populated than others. With regards to fishing, most of the places you will ride through are National Parks. This means that most species of fish in the lakes are protected. You can only legally fish trout, and not with live bait. Hence, it is really hard to catch any! But if you choose to ride in the area of El Bolson, Esquel, Bariloche and Villa la Angostura, you are likely to come across country shops where you'll be able to get supplies. </p> <p>The best time of the year to do your trip is between November and March. Before or after that you risk extremely cold nights (and snow, from April to September). Why not check out <a href=\"http://www.gatomancha.com\">gatomancha.com</a> and ask if horses can be hired? I think it would be much simpler to do this than to buy them. Have a great time, Patagonia is awesome.<br>John </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I've never been horse-riding but I am Argentinian and will be glad to give you a hand for your coming visit to Patagonia. Here are a few websites you may find interesting; the third one is specifically devoted to horse-riding: <a href=\"http:// www.patagonia.com.ar/actividades/cabalgatas.php\">patagonia.com</a>; <a href=\"http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/e/andina/bolson/radal.htm\">patagonia-argentina.com</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.quipiren.com.ar/espanol/patagonia.html\">quipiren.com</a>.</p> <p>Patagonia is a huge region and there are many interesting places. The west has forests and lakes (for example from San Mart\u00edn de los Andes to El Calafate) while the east is mainly a treeless plain with some charming little valleys (like the one of the Chubut river, in which you'll find the descendants of Welsh settlers of the late 19th century). Then you have Tierra del Fuego in the far, far south. As you'll see, there is plenty to choose from.<br>Patricio Cabrera</p>",
  "<p>The chandeliers and gilding in the Ristorante Del Cambio in Turin combine to produce a misty glow. The entrance carpet looks like a Herm\u00e8s scarf. The staff glide around as if on casters and conversation is carried out at the pitch of an idling and expensive motorcar. In the lobby there's an oil painting of Count Cavour - architect of the Risorgimento, and once a regular. They have been serving meals here since 1757 and on the menu today, if you're lucky, is chicken Marengo, the dish invented for Napoleon after an early triumph over the Austrians in the hills to the north. </p> <p>At Lingotto, once the Fiat factory and now a hotel, conference and shopping centre, they are currently holding the biennial Salone del Gusto, an international culinary fair organised by the Slow Food movement which has its headquarters at Bra, 20 or so miles outside of the city. </p> <p>As its name implies, Slow Food is a kind of anti-McDonald's. Started by a Piedmontese food writer, Carlo Petrini, the organisation campaigns for a return to traditional farming and production methods, the use of local ingredients and recipes, the preservation of indigenous varieties of fruit and vegetables and breeds of livestock. Like many campaigning gastronomic movements (Camra, for example), Slow Food is at once radical and conservative, forward thinking and backward looking. </p> <p>At Del Cambio the food is not so much slow as timeless. As such it fulfils many of the demands of Petrini and his followers. The menu di tradizione (which will set you back a handsome \u20ac66 without drinks) includes tajarin - the local egg-rich pasta - with zucchini; veal and wild mushroom stew and a cheeseboard freighted with rare Piedmontese specialities such as the earthy bettelmatt and saras del fen, a creamy ricotta that comes ravelled in fine hay. The wine list leans heavily on the meaty reds from the Langhe valley - barolo (invariably styled \"The king of wines and the wine of kings\") and barbaresco (lighter than barolo and consequently often described as its \"little brother\"). </p> <p> The restaurant dubbed the \"Old Lady\" (a title it shares with Juventus, the city's famous football club) is not alone in preserving Piedmontese culinary heritage. Even Turin's more innovative kitchens honour local culinary tradition rather than simply burying it. Beneath the vaulted brick ceiling of Al Garamond, among the timbales and sturgeon carpaccio, you'll also find a hearty dish of brill in a potato crust and the Piedmontese answer to ravioli, the semicircular agnolotti, stuffed with goats cheese. </p> <p>At the trendy Vintage 1997, meanwhile, the mosaics of tiny vegetables and fusion flourishes have not elbowed aside veal braised in barbaresco, or agnolotti (this time filled with roast pumpkin and rosemary) while the ubiquitous gianduja (a creamy mix of chocolate and toasted hazelnuts that more or less defines the phrase \"Oh I really mustn't have any more, but ...\") comes in a mousse with vanilla sauce. </p> <p> The passion for local ingredients is not only to be found at the ritzier end of the ladder. The vast and sprawling market at the Piazza della Repubblica is the sort of place where the must-have accessory is a wheeled, tartan shopping basket (preferably held together with knotted orange twine) and all business is transacted at a volume sufficient to be heard above the yelling of the traders, the rumble of trams and the crazed twittering of caged songbirds. </p> <p> Here old ladies in headscarves weigh pear-shaped aubergines in the palms of their hands, men with the complexions of tree-stumps shovel finger-sized courgettes complete with the flowers into brown paper bags and diminutive nuns stare intently at the dead eyes of fen-bred carp. There are sweet chestnuts from the Valle di Susa, cherries from Pecetto, boxes of blanched cardoons that look like dead Triffids and piles of the sort of knobbly tomatoes that in Britain can generally only be grown by your Uncle Eric. </p> <p> Turin's central role in the Risorgimento has led to it being styled \"The birthplace of Italy\". The city has also been the natal ward for a good deal of culinary invention. Grissini (breadsticks) is the Torinese gift to peckish diners and the parents of hungry toddlers the world over; Nutella comes from here; so too the choc ice (known as a pinguino, you can still eat them at the gelateria that first created them, Pepino, a few doors along from del Cambio). </p> <p> Piazza Castello, full of snogging students, tumbling fountains and beds of acid-yellow marguerites, is the birthplace of vermouth, or the commercial variety at least. In 1786, Antonio Benedetto Carpano concocted a mix of dry white wine and aromatic herbs, sweetened with spirit, which he believed would be a more suitable beverage for ladies than the local red wines. Carpano was by all accounts a cultured man with a passion for the poetry of Goethe and reputedly named his new drink after the German word for absinthe, \"Wermut\". It proved so popular that soon his shop was open 24 hours a day. Ninety years later, a customer from the nearby Borsa came up with the drink for which Carpano is now best known when he marched in and, in the argot of the stock market demanded a \"Punt e Mes\", a mix of one-and-a-half \"points\" of dark bitters to the usual bianco vermouth. </p> <p> Bombing in 1943 destroyed Carpano's original shop, but you can still drink Punt e Mes across Turin. Ordering one during the aperitivo slot (roughly between 6pm and 8pm) will give you access to a free finger buffet, one of the best of which is found at Caffe Platti. Platti is housed in a building the colour of glazed pastry. The window is decorated with little silver bowls of crystallised violet and rose petals, apple pies with lattice crust, bottles of Bicerin liquor, chocolate tarts and enough boxes of madeleines to send Marcel Proust back into a previous life. It's the sort of place where elderly ladies in mink stoles stride through the door and demand a negroni (a fierce mix of vermouth, campari and gin) and a bowl of water for their dachshund. </p> <p> Baroque is a style of architecture which anyone who cares about food knows is synonymous with calories. Austria, Belgium, these are not countries that practise calorific minimalism. For the cooks of these countries more is more. Turin is one of Europe's great baroque cities and it shares an approach to portion control that anyone who has spent time in Brussels or Vienna will recognise. </p> <p> In Gelateria Fiori the massive ceiling light looks like the sort of thing Esther Williams might have swum in. The marble counter is the colour of hokey pokey ice-cream. The waiter wears a white jacket with gold epaulettes and buttons and a vague nautical air. He has slicked back greying hair and a large chin and his trousers taper dramatically at the ankle exposing feet the size of shoeboxes. </p> <p> He approaches tables swiftly and at an angle like a sailor rolling with the swell and when he discovers that his guests have not yet made up their minds he yaws away with an expression on his face that recalls Tommy Cooper when a trick backfired. The house speciality combines vanilla ice cream, big gloops of gianduja, whipped cream and marsala soaked amaretti biscuits, in a manner that any fan of trifle will wholeheartedly applaud. </p> <p>A few hours later, the Caffe San Carlo. The service is so efficient you have to be on your toes or the staff will order your food for you. After rich cheese risotto (the Po valley is the centre of Italian rice growing) and a plate of cold roast veal with mayonnaise, tuna and capers, I feel that if I eat any more the bomb squad will have to carry out a controlled explosion, but the waiter waves aside my protest. \"You can manage something small,\" he says. \"I'll bring you something. A little thing.\" It proves to be six candied sweet chestnuts and a mound of whipped cream. Afterwards, I walk away gingerly feeling that if I hit a bump my suspension will collapse. </p> <p> In the Via Po, I come across a small market of local organic producers that has been organised and promoted by the regional council. I buy a big slice of toma della Valchiusella cheese from a man whose faded denim shirt and wild mane of greying hair, and scrubby beard gives him the look of a refugee from a 1970s' rock band.</p> <p> Made with unpasteurised milk, it gives off the sweet, warm odour of cows in hay and has a salty tang that sends your saliva ducts into overdrive. It recalls the assessment of another Piedmontese cheese, toma veja, which it is said has threefold benefits, \"It stems your hunger, quenches your thirst and cleans your teeth\". </p> <p> As well as the cheeseman, there are producers selling big jars of chestnut flower honey, fresh salami studded with fennel seeds, peaches in chocolate sauce. There are organic wines, too. Nebbiolo, barbera, dolcetto and asti spumante, a sweet sparkling wine that will suffer forever in Britain by its association with 1970s wedding receptions, but which at its best is really, well, not as bad as you remember, especially if you are eating a rich dessert such as dolce torinese, one of the city's many delicious variations on the theme of chocolate and nuts. </p> <p>The most sought after of all Piedmont's raw ingredients are also on display: white truffles. Unearthed by specially trained dogs (there was once a university of sorts for truffle hounds at Roddi) from between the roots of oaks, chestnuts, willows, hazels and poplar trees, the truffle is a sensitive beast, particularly when it comes to altitude. It is only to be found between 1,300 and 1,950ft. The white truffle has been described as \"the poetic mystery of the gastronomic world\", but there is really nothing mysterious about it. It is a parasitic fungus that attaches itself to the root system of trees - the arboreal equivalent of athlete's foot. </p> <p>The truffle is served with veal, chicken and in risotto, but perhaps most typically in fonduta, the Piedmontese version of the Alpine cheese fondue, which is here made using cream and egg yolks rather than the white wine and kirsch they favour across the border in France and Switzerland. The cheese used is fontina, which has been made in the Valle D'Aosta since the middle ages (the first written reference to it is in Pantaleone da Confienza's Encyclopaedia Of Dairy Products which dates from 1477). </p> <p> Fontina comes in big yellow roundels and gives fonduta its delicate, creamy taste. I bought a jar of it from the stall of one of the producers in via Po. At home, we ate it with grissini. My eight-year-old daughter pronounced it delicious, adding enthusiastically: \"It's like a Dairylea Dunker!\" </p> <p>Though it may be winning the battle in Turin, the Slow Food movement still has work to do. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p> <strong> Getting there </strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">Ryanair</a> (0871 2460 000) flies to Turin from \u00a325.42 rtn inc taxes. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.hotelbostontorino.it\">Hotel Boston</a> (+011 500 359).

  "<p><strong> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday November 1 2004</strong></p> <p>The article below describes the Actuarial Profession as an \"insurers' trade body\". It is actually the umbrella organisation for two professional associations, the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries, to which British actuaries belong. </p> <p> </p> <p>The stories seem to crop up every day. In the last fortnight alone a healthy woman has attempted to sue the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme for the sore feet she suffered after a 50-mile trek and a former pupil has taken her school to court for a gym accident that happened more than 10 years ago. </p> <p>These examples may be at the extreme end of the spectrum but the Actuarial Profession, an insurers' trade body, estimates that the compensation culture is costing Britain \u00a310bn a year, equivalent to \u00a3500 for every household. </p> <p>One factor behind the growth in claims, some critics believe, is the string of companies providing no-win no-fee legal representation. Advertisements for their services can be seen on the back of buses, on billboards and television, even in hospital casualty wards, offering the chance to obtain thousands of pounds for a broken bone, sprained ankle or torn ligament. </p> <p>As judges, politicians and councils warn of the financial and social cost of the burgeoning compensation culture, the Guardian decided to put to the test just how easy it is to launch a claim. </p> <p>The situation could not have been more outlandish. In letters to 19 claims companies, we wrote: </p> <p>\"Dear sir, I was recently walking down a road near to my home when I stepped aside to avoid a boisterous young puppy. In doing so I tripped over an unlaid paving stone. Unfortunately I then fell forward towards the road, instinctively putting my hand out to break my fall. Out of nowhere a cyclist appeared and rode straight over my hand, breaking my wrist in two places and incurring severe bruising to my fingers. </p> <p>Can you help me, please?\" </p> <p>To our surprise many could. Despite the complication of several potential defendants, some firms were so interested in pursuing our claim they sent repeated text and answerphone messages and several letters marked urgent. Nine out of the 19 companies agreed to take the case on, five did not respond and five refused to take the case. </p> <p>Despite the unusual nature of our mishap, Safeclaims Ltd, said they specialised in this type of accident and could help us secure financial compensation. </p> <p>Accident Angels, wrote to assure us that we had a \"strong case for compensation\". Lawcall said they might be able to obtain compensation and guaranteed that we would receive 100% of the money. In most cases the first telephone contact with the claims companies was with call centre staff, who despite a lack of legal qualifications, displayed a remarkable ability to make swift and conclusive legal judgments. </p> <p>Accidents Direct were sympathetic when they spoke to a Guardian reporter about her plight. \"Hello, I understand you've had a bit of a trip and a slip,\" a member of staff said. </p> <p>Pausing to listen to advice in the background, she added: \"Now let me explain to you how personal injury works, ok? There's two elements that need to be satisfied, the first of which is liability and that is who is to blame and how we can prove that. The second element is quantum and that is the extent and severity of the injury. Ok?\" </p> <p>The conversation continued: </p> <p>AD: \"Have we got details of ...I mean ... have we got photographs of the actual paving ... </p> <p>Guardian: \"I didn't take any photographs because I didn't ... </p> <p>AD: \"Well is it still like that?\" </p> <p>Guardian: \"I don't know. I haven't been back. I mean I can go and look.\" </p> <p>AD: \"Yes, if you could just take a look and see if the defect ... if it's still like that, that would be brilliant and also we need to know how long the defect had been there for. Now in order to make a claim the defect needs to have been there for at least six months or over. </p> <p>Guardian: \"Um, what do you mean the defect.\" </p> <p>AD: \"Um, the paving slab ... it needs to be like that for six months. Now the council, they do check, they do spot checks in all the roads and all the pavements twice a year and obviously if it's been like that for over six months it basically shows that they haven't done their job and we will be able to hold them responsible. </p> <p>Guardian: \"Ok </p> <p>AD: \"Do you see? </p> <p>Guardian: Yes, um, are you actually lawyers yourselves? </p> <p>Guardian: \"Um, no, we are [long pause], we are specialists, we are personal injury specialists.\" </p> <p>After telling our reporter she was likely to receive \"at least \u00a31,500\", Accidents Direct told her to return to the scene, take photographs of the \"defect\" or if the slabs had been relaid, knock on the doors to find out how long the pavement had been in a state of disrepair. Should all of this fail, the \"personal injury specialist\" gave her considered opinion: \"Unfortunately, then you won't have no evidence (sic).\" </p> <p>The specialist from Claims Simplicity, who also agreed to take the claim through to the next stage, laughed as she remarked: \"It was quite an event, I can see.\" </p> <p>She went on: \"What we may be able to do then is we may be able to claim against the council. They were the people carrying out the roadworks, if they had the paving there ready to lay but they hadn't sort of fenced it off and there were no warning signs or anything at all, they have been negligent in doing that. I mean they really should put a sign to say ... sort of ... because it is uneven, isn't it?\" </p> <p>Advised that the victim had tripped over stacked paving stones, Claims Simplicity said: \"That makes them even more liable to be honest because they shouldn't be left there without being fenced off.\" </p> <p>A lawyer from Child and Child solicitors said: \"If this is a direct result of the fall then there is a claim.\" </p> <p>Reassured that the wrist was broken in the fall, rather than by the cyclist, he advised the reporter to get an orthopaedic specialist to say the injuries to the wrist were consistent with someone hitting a pavement, then make an appointment with him to go over the story and put in the claim. Asked whether the level of damages would be substantial, he replied: \"Well, if you suffered a fracture or broken bones, yes you are talking about several thousand pounds.\" </p> <p>While all these companies certainly went through the right legal hoops to satisfy the law, others took a less positive view. Russell Jones Walker solicitors refused to take the case after describing the complex law in relation to animals, the need to prove the dog owner knew her puppy had a \"propensity to cause damage\" and the problems with suing the local authority and the cyclist. They were sorry, but \"given the whole unfortunate sequence of events that might actually be quite difficult\". </p> <p>Anderson's Litigation Solicitors, who also refused our case, had perhaps seen it all before. \"We are sorry to hear about your accident,\" they wrote. \"You do appear to have been extraordinarily unlucky.\" </p> <p><strong> Recent decisions suggest judges are attempting to rein back the compensation culture</strong> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ula Heywood, 21, sued the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme after suffering from sore feet following a 50-mile trek in the Lake District. District judge Peter Bullock, threw the claim out at Newcastle county court this week. \"This was intended to be a test of physical strength,\" he said. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A senior judge threw out a claim for damages by a girl who broke her arm at a primary school gym nearly 10 years ago. Despite recovering and continuing to succeed at women's football, Lauren Babbings, now 17, was given legal aid to sue her local authority. </p> <p>Lord Justice Brooke said: \"How boring it would be if there were no risk.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A coroner last week refused to find fault with Sainsbury's after hearing how Alfred Neave, a retired architect, had died last August after tripping over a box left on the floor. </p> <p>Dr Paul Knapman, sitting at Westminster coroner's court, said he did not wish to further restrict our \"over-ordered\" society. Recording a verdict of accidental death, he added: \"Accidents happen. When all is said and done, it is up to each individual to keep a lookout.\"</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,1332853,00.html\">Read part two of How I did it</a></p> <p>Philip Green is a man whose reputation precedes him like a particularly clamorous one-man band, heavy on the cymbals and trombone slides. It's as though he burst out of a side street three years ago, marched himself along the main drag colonising the marketplace, then stopped, turned round and strutted back trailing gaudy evidence of his conspicuous spoils. First, he took over Bhs, then the entire Arcadia Group, which owns the rag-trade high street middle ground - Topshop, Topman, Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge, to name the most prominent - doubling profits on a gentle upward annual trajectory while all about him are dropping off. Meanwhile, we stand on the sidelines wearing his garments, our British puritanical sensibilities outraged, giving him a slow handclap. Boo, we say, who is this vulgarian from the wrong side of the tracks? How did he come to win the real-life Monopoly game while our backs were turned? </p> <p>We don't like this sort of thing. We think there is something faintly obscene about a man who is so full of himself he spends \u00a35m on his own birthday party, particularly if he calls it a \"toga\" party, holds it in Cyprus and welcomes such as Michael Winner to it. Imagine! All done up in sheets like Roman emperors. Who do they think they are? And his wife bought him a solid gold Monopoly set, featuring his very own acquisitions. How bling-bling can you get? And a \u00a37m yacht to swan about in. Can't be right. How rewarded we were when he came a cropper with his bid for Marks &amp; Spencer back in the summer and the big-store establishment told him what he could do with his \u00a39bn bid. He'd have swept the board. Had us over a barrel. There were tantalising tales of fisticuffs among the retail hierarchy and a particularly delicious episode where Green is alleged to have not only landed one on his arch-rival Stuart Rose, but to have subsequently handed him his mobile phone so that his wife could give him a piece of her mind into the bargain. He's a spiv, bawled the media. A former barrow boy, a mock gangster, a rough diamond, a bully boy. He's not like proper City businessmen. I can attest to this last. He isn't. </p> <p>For one thing, he doesn't keep you waiting. None of that usual plutocratic, my-time-is-priceless-your-time-is-worthless exhibitionism applies in Arcadia headquarters. You get about two minutes to register how palatial are the premises, how pretty are the young women, how scrupulously buttoned up inside their suits are the young men and how peacefully reverential are their references to Him and He: then the show is on the road. </p> <p>\"Let's give it a whirl,\" said Philip Green, taking off his jacket, folding back gleaming white cuffs to reveal a watch with which you could circumnavigate the world. You don't get to be a multibillionaire Bonaparte of the retail establishment and control more of London's prime real estate than the Duke of Westminster by sitting dutifully answering questions. And he doesn't. He goes to it at a mile a minute. In short, sharp, staccato bites, he does it his way. Tells you. His way. How he did it. His way. If a modest interjection amuses him, he'll take it up before tossing it aside. Otherwise, he goes silent for a count of about four seconds, then continues as though nothing happened. At one point he rudely interrupted himself. \" Gemma! \" he bawled. \"Can you bring me a cup of tea, darling\" - then, as an afterthought, \"D'you want anything? No? Right, cheap round.\" He doesn't have to do this, he wants you to know. Just last week he turned the entire Channel 4 news team out of this very office. Jon Snow came on all aggressive, pointed his finger at him. He's not having that. Why should he? Still, he's a man of his word. </p> <p>He rattled through the early stuff. Born 1952. Croydon (in case his accent doesn't give him away). Went to boarding school in Berkshire, aged eight. Nothing wrong with that; gives a boy independence and, no, he wouldn't send his own kids away to school. Because he wants them at home, that's why. Left at 15. Parents in business. Garages, electrical shops, property. His heart wasn't in it till he got to the bit about half a crown. When he was 12, his father died. His mum carried on the businesses. \"She's a go-getter,\" he said. \"Still is. Ring her up and she's on the other line to her solicitor, telling him do this, do that. She's still got the properties she had 45 years ago. Still does all her own books at 85 years of age.\" Anyway, back then, she let him help out in the shops and garages. She opened a self-service petrol station and he'd work in the forecourt on weekends and school holidays. Wipe windscreens, change oil, that sort of thing. The punters would tip him, sixpence, two bob, half a crown. \"Half a crown,\" he said with a nostalgic smile. \"Remember them? Nice heavy coin, that.\" Saturdays he could knock up as much as five pounds. Pocket money? What's pocket money? Having money given to you? No way. He earned what he got. At school there were two sorts of boys: those who wanted to stay on and those who wanted to get away. Simple as. He was the second kind. Things have changed, we're in different times now, light years away. Education's high up on the agenda, you know? Everybody pushing to get their kids in university. Living standards have changed, values have changed, the value of money has changed. \"You look round and say to yourself, whoooosh, the last 10 years just flashed by. And you remember what half a crown used to mean.\" </p> <p>Philip Green got his wish and went out to work when he was 16. \"Obviously,\" he said, \"I was never going to be a scholar.\" He laid an emphasis on the \"obviously\" that is both pre-emptive and pragmatic. It tells you he finds nothing wrong with book-learning, but it was not for him, and if you imagine that makes him a dunce, you've got another think coming. While others chose to sit in classrooms being told what to think and how to pass exams, he was out in the real world with the grown-ups, observing how many beans make five. For five formative years he learned the ropes of shoe retailing, importing and so forth, starting with filing and warehouse work and trotting samples to salesmen, until what he didn't know about shoes wasn't worth knowing. </p> <p>\"They were what you might call old money shoes. One-ninety nine, two-ninety nine, mostly imported from China and Taiwan. We were one of the first to do business in the far east. Eventually, after about four years, I was allowed to sell. Talk about how things have changed! In those days, they used to set up in hotels. This was in the Mount Royal Hotel, above the Cumberland. All the importers and buyers would check in for the annual shoe exhibitions. I was standing there and this guy came in and picked up one of our shoes. Well, it was a clog, really, like a Scholl with a bit of a heel and a leather strip over the top. Liked it. How much is it? I said one ninety-nine. What's the price of 40,000 pairs? I said I'd look into it, belted over to the boss. Which is he? I pointed him out. No, he said, he's got long hair, he can't be serious. I knew the guy came from a big group so I said, right, I'm going to get that order. He bet me five pounds that I couldn't and gave me a deadline. So off I went. They wanted them wrapped in a special way, special box, special this, special that, what didn't they want. I said yes, yes, I'd see to all that, and the weeks went by and the deadline was coming up, so I'm chasing, chasing, dadadada, and I get the order, on the nail. I ran all the way up the five flights, up to the top of our building, slapped it down, said there's your order. And he got this old-fashioned leather wallet out of his back pocket, and every note was like it had been ironed. Got the note out, feeling it to make sure it was just the one and handed me the five quid. That was my first order. Anyway, eight weeks later there had been so much aggravation about what they wanted and didn't want, the whole thing got cancelled. So he called me and said, when you're passing, call in and give me my fiver back. Still, he trained me up ...\" </p> <p>By the time Green was 23, he reckoned he was ready to strike out on his own. He took himself to Hong Kong and got the lie of the land. The principle, he reasoned, was the same - he would just deal in jeans instead of shoes. \"That's how I started,\" he said, somewhat portentously. \"Importing jeans.\" </p> <p>It was risky, but I thought it was time to speak up for the wet liberals of this world. \"Sweat shops,\" I ventured. \"Exploiting the poor,\" and waited to be thrown out on to Oxford Street. </p> <p>He paused a couple of seconds. \"Have you ever been to Hong Kong?\" he said. \"No, I didn't think so. It's very fast moving, Hong Kong. Very fast. Very quick. Nobody goes to sleep. They work 17 hours a day and nobody's tired. Hong Kong. Very built up. You wouldn't imagine it. Every inch built up, cram full of people. All working. What's your definition of exploitation? Would you go out and pay twice as much for something you could get three doors away at half the price? What Hong Kong and Taiwan were then, the whole of China is today, and China is the fastest growing country in the world. They've got the endeavour. That's why. Is that exploitation, using the workforce of a billion people who want to make produce for the rest of the world? Now we have Vietnam and eastern Europe. I've just helped one of my suppliers build a factory in Vietnam. So what are we doing, are we providing the expertise in these places to help people work or are we exploiting them? It's a marketplace,\" he said, emphatically, as though I had thought it was a holiday camp, \"and I'm concerned to buy the best products I can in the marketplace we're in. We're not looking to exploit, but we are looking to be quick on our feet.\" He looked about himself for inspiration to clinch his argument, picked up a small bottle of mineral water (in Arcadia, everyone seems to be sip-sip-sipping mineral water all day long) and declared, \"If someone offered me 50,000 bottles of this at the right price, I'd buy them. I'd buy anything. Old stocks, discontinued lines, cancelled orders. At the right price. Now let's get on or we'll be here all day.\" </p> <p>Which brings us to 1979, 25 years ago this very month. Green heard tell of 10 designer gear outlets going out of business. The stock was up for grabs. Thirty-five grand's worth at retail. In like Flynn. \"I'll give you Xp in the pound,\" he said. \"Deliver it to my warehouse.\" Then he went to have a look at it. \"It didn't look all that bad to me,\" he said, \"so I sent it all to the dry cleaners, got it put on nice satin hangers and polythened it up so it looked brand new. Then I thought, why sell it on for a few quid more? Sammy Stewart was retiring, I heard, so I bought his place off him. 41 Conduit Street. Did rather well ...\" </p> <p>Now it's 1981. He bought the place in Bond Street. \"I buy companies like this,\" he said. And spares no detail. \"I went to see this guy, Friday afternoon. Said I understand you want to sell your shop. He said, er, well, yes. I said what you want for it? He said 75 grand. I said Monday morning. Boom-boom - 75 for his lease, 75 for his stock, sight unseen. Go round Monday afternoon, exchange contracts. Then the phone rings. Guy says he understands my shop's for sale. I say he's made a mistake. Then some other guy phones up. I said not interested. Keeps ringing. Right? Seven and a half grand deposit at this point. I say, 'You want to give me 250 grand for it tomorrow afternoon, you can buy it. Take your client round to my lawyer.' So he did, he bought it. But, I said, you can't have it for six weeks. Done. Boom-boom. </p> <p>\"Next morning we're up and running. I only opened the shop in the evenings. Five till eight. By appointment. When people think ... hmmm? They come along. I got my money back within a week. Sold the lot. So I phoned this bloke I bought it off - nice man - and said, have you got any more stock? And he said come to Milan. So I chartered a plane. Leather goods. Some of these designers, they've got stock for years. Warehouses big as old aeroplane hangars, full of it. I said how many pieces are there. He said 20,000. I bought the lot. Must have shipped four, five trailers. We filled this shop, floor to ceiling, put up these great big posters and had them queueing all down Bond Street. Wasn't popular with the rest of the street, but what could they do?\" </p> <p>But this was small beer. The preface to a major hurricane. The tension is building for the big one. Philip Green extracts another long, thin fag from the packet marked Fumer Tue and prepares to enjoy himself. How he made his first million. </p> <p>\"Guy comes to see me, Thursday morning. He's got an import business. Jeans. Gone broke, receivers in, dadadada. He's owed a million quid. Got about 400,000 pairs of jeans. Wants 935 grand. I called my bank, said it's got to be done tomorrow night. Next day they say OK. I say good, we've got to get to Bristol, pick you up at four. Chartered a helicopter. Off we go, banker, lawyer and me. Spend all night negotiating to buy this company. Five in the morning, one point one million, all done. Not allowed to start the helicopter up after that. Too noisy that time of the morning. Middle of nowhere, pitch black, police car comes by, gives us a lift to the train station, quick kip on a bench, caught the milk train back to London. </p> <p>\"Monday morning we're up and running. We'd bought various people who owed money, so we go and see one of them. In Devon, it was. Said we'd like to collect our 250,000 quid. We had a little debate and he signed 10 postdated cheques. As we're leaving, he said, just en passant, he wished he could sell his business in three days flat. I didn't even know what he did. Found out, called him up next morning. Said was that a joke? Went to see him in Slough. Big building. He had 65 shops, concessions at Debenhams. He wanted four million quid. Have a look at his books. Didn't seem to add up right. Got my accountant to do a bit of a recce. Turned out he owed the bank three and a half million and his suppliers three and a half million. He's bankrupt. They're losing 70,000 a week. Can't pay the staff. Call him up on the Tuesday, say there's good news and there's bad news. The good news is I'll buy it. The bad news is you're broke. Said I'd take an option for 65,000 followed by another 435 if I get round the bend in six months. He said we're done,\" and Green is barely pausing for breath. </p> <p>\"I went to see the bank, said the business is broke but I think I can fix it. I'll give you 100,000 as a gesture of goodwill towards your three and a half million if you freeze the debt for six months. Done. Then I had a look at the business. I could see what had happened. The usual. Same issues you see today. Bad buying, no discipline, no control, old stock, indecision, time-wasting, corporate thinking. I flew to Paris, shopped the shops, three suitcases of merchandise, went to Hong Kong, got it all copied, flew in, restocked the shops, got all the creditors reflowed, and got the business back to breaking even in four months. </p> <p>\"Out of the sky the phone rings. These people want to buy me up. I said no, I just bought it. Don't want to sell. They went on. And on. I said all right, come and see me. Said look, I want 10 million for it. They said how d'you make that out? I said, well, basically I don't want to sell, so if you pay me what it's not worth I'll sell it. Now I've got a deadline with the bank for February 26 1985 and I end up selling the business on the 25th. For seven million. Went down to the bank in Curzon Street, said what do I owe you? They said dunno, er, 3 million 430 thousand pounds, I said right, there's your cheque. Slapped it down. Done.\" He cracked his palms together, his eyes bright with remembered relish. \"So,\" he said. \"Can be done is my motto!\" </p> <p>He wanted my tape off then, which was just as well, since I had become somewhat slack-jawed listening to all this. He set out a few ground rules. No, he will not pick over old sores. He will not bad-mouth the competition, the press, the City or remark upon the lamentable plight of high-street behemoths not in his control. Nothing in it for him. You've got to enjoy life, he said. He lives in Monte Carlo. Full time. He commutes to work. He has transport - a nice business jet that seats 12. A Gulf Stream, if I must know. He takes 10 weeks off a year and it's not a bad formula, that. He relaxes with the wife and kids. Swimming, cycling, tennis, ping-pong, sailing, whatever. Yes, they've got a yacht. They're keen boaters. And ping-pong's a favourite. He plays to win, none of that nonsense about letting the kiddies win. As with everything he does, he does his best and he likes to come off best. Winning's better than losing. Happy's better than sad. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,1332853,00.html\">Read part two here ...</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Additional research: <strong>Helen Oldfield</strong></p>",
  "<p>Carl Hiaasen has spent the past two months in the eye of the storm, the stance for which he is best known. As the unofficial voice of Florida, Hiaasen, renowned for his satirical novels and newspaper columns, has written frequently about the hurricanes that regularly batter his beloved home state. In particular, he focuses his angry gaze on local government \"shoddiness\", and corrupt building inspectors and developers. In his 1993 novel Stormy Weather, the inspectors sacrifice animals in the hope of escaping prison, while tourists get out their video cameras when they see hurricane victims dying in the street. </p> <p>In 1994, he devoted one of his columns in the Miami Herald to criticising the paper for accepting advertising from a construction company responsible for homes that he alleged \"splintered like popsicle sticks\" in a storm. The Herald lost a major advertiser, but supported their hugely popular columnist. Hiaasen's own home and family were unharmed by the most recent hurricanes. </p> <p>Meanwhile another storm is blowing up - the US presidential election. Florida looks set to prove as crucial to this election as it was to the last one. In 2000, the combination of \"hanging chads\" and the controversial tactics of Katherine Harris, Florida's then secretary of state, who managed to wipe hundreds of Democrat voters off Florida's electoral roll, became national scandals and, many believe, altered the outcome of that election. This time, all eyes are on this politi cally divided and vital swing state. As a native Floridian well known for his liberal politics, Hiaasen's views are canvassed keenly and read widely. While he criticises what he sees as the Democrats' insufficiently aggressive campaigning, he reserves much of his ire for Ralph Nader, whom he calls a \"petulant spoiler\", and a \"hypocrite\" for letting the well-monied Republican machine, which he professes to deplore, support his \"sham campaign\" (Florida's Republican party administration, headed by Governor Jeb Bush, ensured that Nader appeared on the ballot for next month's election, against the protests of the Democrats). Nader won 97,000 votes in Florida four years ago as the Green party candidate, when Bush clinched the election by a margin of only 537, but Hiaasen says he has nothing against the Green party. \"The re-election of Bush would be a disaster only for those Americans who want clean air, clean water, a balanced budget, a sane energy policy and an end to the bloody mess in Iraq,\" he adds with deadpan irony. </p> <p>Despite the fact that he is an outspoken Democrat, Hiaasen's fans span the political spectrum. Bill Clinton regularly requests early copies of his novels and George Bush Sr recently wrote asking for some signed bookplates for his wife. Bush Jr has yet to ask for an autograph but \"I'd be thrilled if he did because it would suggest he has a sense of humour - which would suggest that he has intelligence... But I'd bet the only fiction that boy reads is memos from Cheney.\" </p> <p>PJ O'Rourke, the conservative com mentator, puts Hiaasen's cross-party appeal down to his \"eye for what is obviously wrong without getting carried away on the argument, whether he's writing about national politics or local ecology. Anyone who goes to south Florida can see there is clearly a problem, so it's not too hard to listen to this Jeremiah hollering in the wilderness.\" </p> <p>\"He's just really, really funny,\" adds Dave Barry, a Pulitzer prize-winning columnist who works with Hiaasen at the Miami Herald. \"Even when I don't agree with his point, I love the way he writes it. He presents his rage in an entertaining way. Carl is a literary Eeyore with his air of gloom. Which is funny because he's this extremely good-looking guy with a beautiful wife, a house on the Key, he's extremely successful.\" The Wall Street Journal described Hiaasen's style as a combination of the \"scrutiny of Tom Wolfe and the twisted imagination of Hunter S Thompson\". </p> <p>But rage can be monotonous and some critics have complained that Hiaasen's novels harp on a predictable string, a complaint unwittingly underlined by his former UK publisher, Pan Macmillan, with the repetitive design of his book jackets (he has recently transferred to Transworld), as well as the insistence of his American publishers on the thumping two-word titles ( Tourist Season, Lucky You, Basket Case), \"for the sake of branding\", Hiaasen explains with a touch of wryness. </p> <p>Carl Hiaasen was born in 1953 in Plantation, Florida, a small suburb of Fort Lauderdale, the eldest of four children. His grandfather and namesake, \"a big stubborn Norwegian farmboy\", had moved to Florida from North Dakota in 1922. He started up a law firm, later joined by Hiaasen's father Odel, which earned much of its business from property development, exactly the form of business against which Hiaasen rails in his books. Despite the recurrence in his novels of sons who are disappointed with their fathers' careers, Hiaasen insists he never resented his father for doing this work. His mother, Patricia, who still lives in the house where Hiaasen grew up, was a teacher. His sister Barbara works in conservation, \"but she has the more scientific approach whereas I'm just the pissed-off guy boxing in the shadows.\" </p> <p>When Hiaasen was growing up, Plantation was fringed with swamps and scrubs, and his voice rises as he recounts his childhood adventures. Much of this area was later obliterated. The dirt road on which he and his two best friends, Bob Branham and Clyde Ingalls, would ride their bikes, is now an eight-lane motorway dotted with nine shopping malls: \"It is a very difficult thing for a kid to watch that unfettered part of your childhood being paved before your eyes,\" he says. Branham, still Hiaasen's close friend, adds: \"Carl always felt strongly about the destruction of the wildlife around him, and now he's got a pulpit.\" </p> <p>Hiaasen's outlook was also shaped by the wider political crises of the 1960s. \"I was tremendously affected by the assassinations of the 60s, especially John F Kennedy, then Bobby [Kennedy] and Martin [Luther King],\" he remembers. \"It just seemed like all the stitching of the country was coming undone in such a violent way.\" </p> <p>In high school, he started a satirical newspaper, More Trash, that he wrote himself, and discovered that humour was a more effective method for making people listen to an opposing voice than \"proselytising and ranting\": \"The cool kids who never spoke to me would stop me in the halls and tell me how much they liked More Trash so I realised then that people really like to laugh,\" he remembers. </p> <p>A few months shy of their high-school graduation, Hiaasen's friend Clyde Ingalls committed suicide. \"Clyde was this gangly, curly-haired guy, not very smooth with the ladies, very troubled,\" says Branham. Hiaasen immortalised his friend in his books in the character of Skink, a wild-eyed woodsman who lives to protect the Everglades from developers. \"People like to put some political spin on poor Skink, but he has always just been my idea of what would have happened to Clyde if he had grown up,\" says Hiaasen. </p> <p>Soon after Clyde's death, Hiaasen, then 17, married his high-school girlfriend, Connie Lyford, and went to Emroy College. Their son Scott, who now works as a journalist, was born the following year. \"I never resented the responsibility, but then I wasn't exactly a party guy. I certainly can't remember going home in the evening and thinking, 'man, I wish I was a surfer',\" Hiaasen laughs. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Florida to study journalism and after graduation worked as a reporter and then feature writer for a local paper based in the rural town of Cocoa. Two years after that, Hiaasen's father died, aged 49. When Hiaasen was offered a job by the Miami Herald he accepted in order to be closer to his mother, and reluctantly moved back to Plantation, commuting to Miami. </p> <p>Hiaasen says he learned to read, aged four, by poring over the Miami Herald sports pages. But his decision to work in journalism was a mixture of pragmatism and idealism. \"I knew I'd become a writer eventually, but my focus then had to be the newsroom and bringing home a pay cheque for the family,\" he says. \"It was a hell of a time to go into journalism because you felt so inspired by what the New York Times and Washington Post were doing [about Watergate],\" he remembers. \"There was this feeling that there was a great wrong, and the wrongdoers were running the country.\" </p> <p>Hiaasen's vivid sense of right and wrong still informs his journalism today, particularly with regard to the war in Iraq (\"Vietnam without the mosquitoes\"), of which he has been a vociferous critic in the Miami Herald. \"People say sometimes, gosh, that was brave of you to write such-and-such last week. 'Brave?' What do they mean 'brave?' It's right! How could you not write it? Sure, it would be easier to write a funny story about something the dog dug up in the garden, and there are those columnists who do that. But I told my editor, the day I do that, put a bullet in my brain because it's over.\" </p> <p>Hiaasen arrived at the Miami Herald in 1976 and within three years had worked his way up to the investigations team. \"It was clear from the start that Carl had a very fine sense in finding a story,\" says his former editor James Savage. \"He can build a story, like a craftsman builds a house. He could see from the start what one quote, what illustrative anecdote the story would need, whereas the rest of us would be gassing about for weeks.\" </p> <p>Hiaasen's work on the investigations team was exactly what he had dreamed of doing as a child, and he makes references to those days fondly and frequently in conversation and his books. His narrators wax sentimental about the grubby old days of journalism, when newspaper offices reeked of coffee and cigarettes and stale pizza. \"You'd hear the wire machines chittering and the police scanners gabbling and the paste-up guys snorting at dirty jokes... These days we buy the loyalty of our readers with giveaways and grocery coupons, not content,\" he writes in Basket Case (2002). \"Not to make a dinosaur out of myself, they really are very different from when I was young. Newspapers have dramatically slimmed down and are just not as fun, which is why I don't regret not doing the investigation stuff anymore. Those days are gone,\" he says. </p> <p>It was at the Herald that he met Bill Montalbano, who suggested the two of them write a thriller based on a news story Hiaasen had recently covered about a Columbian assassin. (\"There was a lot of violence in Miami then. It was before Don Johnson showed up in his Armanis.\") They wrote three books together - Powder Burn, Trap Line and A Death in China - straight-up thrillers in which men use few words and women wait for them in bed with sassy rejoinders and seductive smiles. \"Those books were much more in Bill's voice than Carl's,\" says Hiaasen's longtime agent Esther Newberg. \"Carl was then just in his 20s and Bill, being much older and experienced, was a real mentor to him.\" After the third book, Montalbano was transferred to China as a foreign correspondent and Hiaasen decided to write on his own. </p> <p>In Tourist Season (1986), his first solo venture, Hiaasen found his own style - fast-paced, tongue-in-cheek - and his subject matter. The novel tells the story of an egomaniacal newspaper columnist, Skip Wiley, who becomes so enraged by the overdevelopment of Florida that he resorts to terrorism. Hiaasen points out that he wasn't actually made a columnist until after he had written the book, but his readers are inevitably curious about the relationship between the author and his characters. Autobiographical details are scattered among his protagonists, including one who keeps pet snakes (Hiaasen recently released his because \"the quantity of rats they consumed required many trips to the local pet store, and my wife wasn't keen on travelling with a carful of rodents\"). </p> <p>\"In each of the books I want there to be a character who gets away with stuff I wish I could,\" Hiaasen says, with a grin. There is, he adds, quoting Skink in Sick Puppy (2000), \"a fine line between good crazy and bad crazy\". Although the names change, the main character in all his novels is a hard-living bachelor, a renegade outsider and often one who left journalism due to some kind of scandal. \"That protagonist, that louche outsider, is Carl's self-idealisation. It's like his alter-ego,\" says Branham. \"But I see it as him exaggerating himself.\" </p> <p>He is not quite the outsider, however. On the rare occasions that Hiaasen visits the Miami Herald's office these days, \"there is a receiving line of people waiting to greet him like a long lost son\", says his editor Bob Radziewicz. In the columns he has written for the Herald since 1985, Hiaasen is known for being fearlessly direct. In one, he described as \"boneheaded\" the decision of a city commission to withhold funding for a convention out of fear that communists might attend. When the commission demanded a clarification to this \"false and misleading statement\", Hiaasen replied that because the column was neither false nor misleading he couldn't so much as add \"a cheerfully instructive footnote\". </p> <p>Double Whammy (1987) and Skin Tight (1989) soon followed Tourist Season, coinciding with his gradual move away from the newspaper office to writing from home. Yet the influence of his journalism is always apparent in his novels. Contemporary news stories, or ones he worked on as an investigative reporter, often find their way into the books. He was inspired to write Lucky You (1997) by the case of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. He held up to ridicule the growing white supremacy movement and simultaneously showed how it was a product of America's blinkered refusal to look at problems within: \"There's so much hate that we direct externally that we forget we have our own psychos. But that's the role of the satirist - you have to examine your own country and say, look!\" He is a vocal supporter of the death penalty for those, such as McVeigh, who \"richly deserve it\": \"Bye bye, Tim! That's what I say and I'm a liberal.\" </p> <p>He researches his novels just as he did his investigations. Strip Tease (1993), set in an erotic dancing club, is full of journalistic observational detail, such as the \"studious and impassive expressions [of the clients], like judges at a cattle auction\". \"When Carl was doing Strip Tease , he wanted to go to strip joints, which is the last place you'd usually find him,\" James Savage recalls. \"So he called up my wife and asked her if she'd mind if I accompanied him, and off we went. Of course, Carl being Carl, he spent most of the time talking to the girls about problems they had with child care.\" </p> <p>But it is his wildly comic plotting that has secured Hiaasen his popularity with readers. \"You can see elements in the books that he can't use in his journalism: his descriptions, dialogue, characters -they are all so wonderful and funny as hell,\" says Barry. \"And there's always this weird twist, like that guy with a WeedWhacker [a kind of strimmer] for an arm in Skin Tight. It makes you wonder what's going on in his brain. I'm glad he writes because if he didn't he'd probably be out there killing people.\" </p> <p>In Hiaasen's fiction, almost all actions are revealed to be self-serving. Seemingly altruistic gestures by a politician turn out to have mercenary motives; any declaration of intent will prove to be pretence. But he writes from the villain's point of view with obvious glee, and Barry says that while he is cynical, \"he's not bitter, and I think that's because he uses his writing as a vent - Carl doesn't keep his feelings in, that's for sure\". </p> <p>Despite the cynicism, Hiaasen the novelist tends towards happy endings. In Hoot (2002), in order to stop the construction company, the three children play around with the surveyors' stakes, just as Hiaasen, Branham and Ingalls used to do. But unlike them, the fictional children are successful. \"That,\" he says, \"is wishful thinking overcoming my Norwegian pessimism.\" </p> <p>As he has increasingly spent more time on his books and less on his journalism (since he began as a columnist for the Miami Herald he has cut down from three columns a week to one), the former have become more subtle and confident. Starting with Strip Tease, which was unsuccessfully adapted into a film starring Demi Moore, and continuing with his latest book, Skinny Dip, he has increasingly written from women's points of view and his first foray into children's literature, Hoot, won the prestigious Newbery Award two years ago. </p> <p>Although he still uses his books to do what he originally loved about journalism - \"righting wrongs and pointing out the crap\" - he has given increasing attention to the demands of fiction. Andrew Billen in the Evening Standard wrote in 2002: \"When it comes to women, his novels remain hormonally challenged.\" But in Skinny Dip , he has created a female character who is neither idealised nor demonised, but believably fallible, albeit a persona who, like all of Hiaasen's female characters, provides salvation to the hapless male character. </p> <p>In the early 90s, Hiaasen and Connie separated and he moved down to the Keys on his own. In the evenings, he would go to a local restaurant for a bite and a leisurely read. The manager of the restaurant, Fenia Clizer, noticed him and \"thought this was peculiar behaviour, seeing as drinking and partying are the main recreations around here\", says Hiaasen. They recently celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary. Anecdotes about their four-year-old son, Quinn (\"That was the one name I could think of that didn't remind me of someone who I didn't like, and, of course, he is The Mighty Quinn\"), and 13-year-old stepson Ryan are related with the pride of the second-time-around father. Both boys, he adds, are big classic rock fans; Quinn knows all the lyrics to \"Stairway to Heaven\". </p> <p>As well as journalism, 60s and 70s rock music looms large in Hiaasen's novels. Good characters like it and bad or dumb ones get the lyrics wrong. In his study, an old poster of the Rolling Stones is lovingly framed; a shiny acoustic guitar rests on the floor. \"Playing guitar is the one thing Carl can't do well,\" says Barry with a laugh. \"I'm in a band with Amy Tan and Stephen King [The Rock Bottom Remainders] and Carl plays with us occasionally. I remember one time we were playing and Carl brought his guitar teacher along and the two of them were at the back and you could hear in every song the teacher yelling, 'C, Carl! Now A!'\" </p> <p>Whenever he feels blocked, he \"bangs the hell out of the guitar\" until he feels right again. The musician Warren Zevon, who died last year of lung cancer, was a particularly close friend, and the two bonded over a shared \"dark, visceral kind of humour\". Zevon was one of the few people who was allowed to read Hiaasen's novels in progress. Hiaasen sent him the manuscript of Skinny Dip chapter by chapter, and it was Zevon who suggested the title. The last conversation Hiaasen had with him was on a Friday when Zevon requested the final chapters. But Hiaasen wanted still to tweak them so he hesitated before posting them. Zevon died on the Sunday. The chapters arrived on Monday. \"As a fellow perfectionist,\" Hiaasen says, \"Warren would have understood.\" </p> <p>Some have suggested that, after a lifetime of being angry, maturity and a second marriage have mellowed him. He is, he says, \"probably more of a novelist than a journalist these days\", if only because he spends much more time on the former. </p> <p>\"I think he's less interested in shocking people,\" says Barry. \"I don't want to say his humour has softened but he's become more patient in his novels about letting you find the characters and the humour.\" This has given his novels a warmer glow than the tangy sharpness of his earlier work. Skinny Dip has been greeted in the US with adulatory reviews. Writing in the New York Times, critic Janet Maslin described it as \"a screwball delight so full of bright, deft, beautifully honed humour that it places Mr Hiaasen in the company of Preston Sturges, Woody Allen and SJ Perelman\". </p> <p>He rarely leaves the island these days - the thought of traffic is a sufficient deterrent - making only the rare exception for his sons and the occasional rock concert. Instead, he spends his days in his white house with his young family, taking the boat out on the Bay. From his doorstep he can see more and more housing developments approaching. When the children are at school, he holes up in his office, which faces, not the ocean, but the main road with the passing traffic that gets louder every day: if it looked out on the water, he explains, he'd never do any work, he'd spend all day staring at the herons and the seacows. </p> <p>But Hiaasen insists he is as angry as he ever was. He is angry about the war, angry about political failures, angry about the upcoming election and, most of all, as ever, angry about the destruction of Florida. He still sees it as his \"responsibility\" to tell people about this stuff. \"I do believe the system will out the bastards.\" But, he adds, in a stern voice that comes wrapped inside a calm smile, \"you gotta stay mad. As frightening as this may sound, what you see in the books is the way I see the world. And so far I haven't seen anything, either in Florida or elsewhere, to dissuade me from it.\" </p> <p><strong> Carl Andrew Hiaasen</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Born: </strong> March 12 1953, Florida. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> 1970-72 Emory University; '72-74 University of Florida. </p> <p><strong> Married:</strong> 1970 Connie Lyford, '96 divorced (one son); '99 Fenia Clizer, (one son, one stepson). </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> 1974-76<strong> </strong> Reporter for Cocoa Today, Florida; '76-79 reporter, Miami Herald; '79-85 investigative reporter, Miami Herald; '85- weekly columnist, Miami Herald. </p> <p><strong> Some books:</strong> 1986 Tourist Season; '87 Double Whammy; '89 Skin Tight; '91 Native Tongue; '93 Strip Tease, Stormy Weather; '97 Lucky You; '98 Team Rodent: How Disney Devours the World; 2000 Sick Puppy; '02 Basket Case, Hoot; '04 Skinny Dip. </p> <p>With William Montalbano: 1981 Trap Line, Powder Burn; '86 A Death in China. </p> <p><strong> Some awards:</strong> 2003 Newbery Award; '03 Damon Runyon Award for services to journalism. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Skinny Dip by Carl Hiaasen is published by Transworld at \u00a312.99.</p>",

  "<b> I am expecting a baby at the end of November and am currently on maternity leave. My employer has just announced a round of redundancies at the end of this year, and I have been told my job is at risk. I do not think I am being targeted because I am pregnant, but I am concerned about my future. What rights do I have?</b> <p>If you have been employed for at least a year, then you have the right not to be unfairly dismissed. To avoid dismissing you unfairly, your employer has to ensure that this is a genuine redundancy situation, that it has selected you for redundancy by applying objective selection criteria fairly, that it engages in meaningful consul tation with you before making a final decision, and that it considers if there is any suitable alternative employment. </p> <p>If your employer goes ahead the with redundancy plans, then you have the right to receive proper notice of termination of your employment, as provided in your contract. </p> <p>Because you are on maternity leave, you have a number of additional rights. First, if there is a suitable available vacancy, you have an absolute right to be offered that job (on appropriate terms) as an alternative to redundancy. </p> <p>If your employer fails to do this, your dismissal will be automatically unfair. Second, if your redundancy is confirmed, you have a right to a written statement of the reasons for your dismissal without having to ask for this. Finally, given the timing of your dismissal, your employer will have to continue paying you statutory maternity pay notwithstanding that your employment has ended, unless, of course, you start a new job. </p> <p><b>As an employer, we have recently made a member of staff's role redundant. We have paid him statutory redundancy pay and all other payments owed under his written contract. However, he claims we are obliged to pay him an 'enhanced redundancy sum' that other colleagues received in the past. There is nothing about enhanced redundancy payments in written contract. Do we have to pay him?</b> </p> <p>The terms of an employee's contract of employment may be express, implied or incorporated. Express terms include those in a written document and those verbally agreed between the parties. Other terms may be implied in a contract to give it business efficacy, if they are customary in the trade or if they form the normal practice of the employer. If there is nothing in the contract and no express agreement with the employee in question, it will only be a contractual term if it is an implied term. </p> <p>A term may be implied by 'custom and practice' if it forms the usual practice of the employer and is 'reasonable, notorious and certain'. Check exactly how often your company has made enhanced redundancy payments in the past, to whom and on what terms. Again, if such payments can be said to be 'reasonable, notorious and certain', then the payment may be an implied contractual term and the company will be obliged to pay the enhancement to the employee. </p> <p>However, if the company has not made such enhanced redundancy payments regularly in the past it is unlikely that such payment will be an implied contractual term and there will be no obligation to pay. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Meriel Schindler is head of the employment group at solicitors Withers LLP.

  "<p>In the run-up to Christmas, the festive spirit will prompt many of us to give money to good causes, whether in response to major charity appeals or to collection boxes in pubs, shopping centres, schools and churches. But it's worth stopping to think about whether you are donating your money in the most effective way. </p> <p>As a nation, we Brits aren't bad at charitable giving. Following a dip in individual giving during the recession of the early to mid 90s, charitable donations have picked up and are now back at the giving levels of 10 years ago. </p> <p>Around 68% of us each year give to charity and last year, collectively, we gave \u00a37.3bn, either through regular donations or in response to specific appeals. </p> <p>That's not to say we couldn't do a lot better. A new survey from independent charity Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) reveals that more than half the population say they could afford to give more and around 40% of adults say they could actually double the amount of money they give to charity each week. </p> <p>\"Ultimately if everyone who said they could double their giving actually did, an extra \u00a355m would be going to charity every week,\" says Cathy Pharoah, director of research at CAF. </p> <p>But, while we should consider giving more, we should also be looking carefully at how we give the money. The fact is that only one in three charitable donations is tax-efficient. As a result, both donors and charities are missing out on millions of pounds in generous tax reliefs. </p> <p>\"Most people who give to charity could be giving more than a quarter more to their chosen causes without it costing them another penny simply by giving tax-efficiently,\" Ms Pharoah says. </p> <p>The most popular way to boost the value of your charitable donations is to Gift Aid them. If you give \u00a31 in the normal way, by putting it into a collection box for example, the charity will receive \u00a31. But if you give \u00a31 under the government's Gift Aid scheme, the charity will receive \u00a31.28 - in other words increasing the value of your gift by 28% - by claiming 28p in tax back from the Inland Revenue. </p> <p>If you are a higher rate taxpayer you can also reclaim tax worth 23p for every pound you donate, either as a personal benefit or you can choose to give it to charity. The way the scheme works means, for example, that it costs a basic rate taxpayer \u00a3100 to make a donation of \u00a3128 to a charity, while making the same donation of \u00a3128 will cost a higher rate taxpayer just \u00a377. </p> <p>Any taxpayer who has paid enough income tax or capital gains tax in the current financial year to cover the amount reclaimed by the charity can use Gift Aid. All you need to do is complete a simple declaration, giving the charity your name and address and confirming that you are aware of the requirement to have paid enough tax. This can be done in writing, over the phone or online. </p> <p>Once you have made a Gift Aid declaration, it can cover all gifts you've made to that charity in the past and all those you make in the future until you notify them otherwise. Only \u00a32.3bn of last year's \u00a37.3bn was Gift-Aided. CAF estimates that if half the remaining \u00a35bn given to charity non-tax-efficiently was converted under Gift Aid, it would attract a possible \u00a3500m in tax relief. It's not easy or even possible to Gift Aid all donations. Obvious gifts that may escape the Gift Aid net for practical reasons include, for example, money put into school, pub and church collection boxes. </p> <p>But Ms Pharoah says: \"Charities which make door-to-door collections or those which sign people up on the high street for regular direct debit donations are often reluctant to present donors with Gift Aid forms because many people find this intrusive and don't want to give their personal details. This is a pity. People wouldn't mind giving these details if they realised how much it could benefit the charities to which they are donating.\" </p> <p>One way round this is to ask collectors if your donation can be converted under the Gift Aid scheme. If not, think twice about donating in this way and ask if there is another method you could use which will allow you to boost your gift using the scheme. </p> <p>One way of ensuring all your gifts are tax-effective for receiving charities, however you make a donation - whether in person, by phone, post or online - is to open a CAF Charity Account. </p> <p>Acting like a current account, the Charity Account provides you with a CharityCard similar to a debit card, a chequebook if you require one, and regular statements, covering all your giving options from regular amounts to one-off cheques for doorstep appeals. </p> <p>You donate money into the account and CAF reclaims tax at 28p in the pound and adds it to your balance. You are then free to make payments from the account as and when you please. CAF will check that any charity you decide to donate to is registered and above board. </p> <p>You can fund your account in several ways: with one-off gifts at any time by credit or debit card; with regular donations by setting up a direct debit; through donations from your gross salary if your employer or pension provider operates a payroll giving scheme; or even by making gifts of stocks and shares. The latter method involves gifting your shares to CAF, which then sells them. This attracts a double tax benefit - capital gains tax exemption and income tax relief on the market value. </p> <p>CAF charges an administrative fee of 4% of your gross donations to run the account and reclaim the tax - probably equivalent to the amount it costs charities in admin to reclaim tax on individual gifts. This means that for every \u00a3100 you put in to your account, you end up with \u00a3123 to give to charities after the tax has been reclaimed and the admin fee deducted. </p> <p>For more information on methods of tax-efficient charitable giving, visit <a href=\"www. allaboutgiving.org.uk\">www.allaboutgiving.org.uk</a> </p> <p>If Jobs &amp; Money readers open a CAF Charity Account with a minimum of \u00a3100 or sign a direct debit for a minimum of \u00a310 a month, CAF will add a further \u00a315 which the account holder can donate at a later date.

  "An Egyptian government delegation will fly to Tel Aviv next month with proposals to help Israel's planned pullout from the Gaza Strip next year, including the deployment of two Egyptian battalions along the border. <p>The 750 border guards, part of Cairo's military elite and equipped with armoured vehicles, would replace Israeli troops along the Egypt-Gaza frontier to try to stop Palestinians smuggling arms. </p> <p>They would take up position in January. </p> <p>The delegation, led by the head of intelligence, Omar Suleiman, and the foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, will also offer to station about 80 military advisers in the Strip, initially for six months, to help the Palestinian Authority maintain calm after the Israelis go. </p> <p>Ariel Sharon, Israel's prime minister, is proposing to pull 7,500 Jewish settlers out of the Gaza Strip next year and to withdraw the thousands of soldiers there to protect them. </p> <p>The plan has caused deep divisions in Israel, where the Knesset is due to vote on it next week. </p> <p>Egypt's offer brings a new element to the attempts to resurrect the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. </p> <p>With Mr Sharon refusing to speak to the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, Mr Suleiman has been acting as a go-between for the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli and US governments. </p> <p>Mr Suleiman and Mr Gheit are due to meet Mr Sharon and his foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, on November 11. </p> <p>Cairo wants Israel to pull its soldiers out of the Philadelphi road, the eight-mile buffer zone on the border, and let them be replaced by the Egyptian force. </p> <p>The Israeli army does not want to withdraw from the zone, arguing that it would open the way for increased smuggling through tunnels at Rafah. But an Israeli foreign ministry official said the final decision would be made by politicians, not the army. </p> <p>The official said that Israel wanted a big enough Egyptian force to prevent smuggling, but not big enough to pose a threat to Israel. </p> <p>The 1979 Camp David treaty between Israel and Egypt prevents the latter from stationing anything more than a small police force there. Egypt is proposing an exchange of letters with Israel, rather than a rewriting of the treaty, to circumvent this. </p> <p>As well as dealing with external security, Cairo is seeking to ensure that the Gaza Strip will be relatively quiet after an Israeli withdrawal, and that Hamas and other Palestinian factions do not continue to fire Qassam rockets into Israel. </p> <p>The Egyptians say they have promises from Hamas, Islamic Jihad, al-Aqsa Brigade and another 10 Palestinian factions that they are willing to go to Cairo to sign one-year ceasefire agreements with Israel. </p> <p>As well as proposing to provide military advisers, the Egyptians are already training about 50 Palestinian security officers in Egypt. </p> <p>They have also asked the Israelis - so far without success - to promise that their army will not attack the Gaza Strip while Egyptian military advisers are present. </p> <p>In the longer term the Egyptians are trying to ensure that the Israeli pullout plans do not stop at the Gaza Strip but eventually include the West Bank, so that a viable Palestinian state can be created. </p> <p>Among the ideas being floated in the negotiations is for a new railway line to connect the Strip and the West Bank. </p> <p>The Egyptians are also trying to persuade the Israelis to restore the Palestinians' access to their own port and airport in the Strip. </p> <p>An Egyptian foreign ministry official proposed that these facilities should be under Palestinian control but overseen by international monitors acceptable to the Israelis - possibly from Europe or Canada, but not Nato. </p> <p>The Egyptians and Israelis are also discussing what will happen to the Jewish settlers' homes when the Israelis withdraw. </p> <p>Although the negotiations have not been completed, the intention of both sides at present is that the Israelis will dismantle the houses but leave the infrastructure in place.</p>",
  "Police and the Home Office yesterday hailed a small victory in the battle to eliminate football hooliganism with the announcement of a 10% decline in arrests for football-related disorder in England and Wales during the 2003-04 season. <p>Arrests at league, cup and internationals matches involving teams from England and Wales were down from 4,413 in 2002-03 to 3,982 last year. With more than 36m supporters attending games the figures show an arrest rate of 0.01%, or 1.6 arrests per match. </p> <p>The majority of matches last season were trouble-free, with 50% of Premiership, 72% of first division, 82% of second division and 89% of third division matches passing off with one arrest or less. A quarter of all games took place without a police presence. </p> <p>Most trouble now occurs away from matches, with 87% of the arrests for violent disorder and 57% of total arrests occurring outside grounds. </p> <p>The reduction in arrests coincides with a 45% increase in the number of banning orders issued to known or suspected hooligans, a rise seen as central to the reduction in disorder at and around matches. </p> <p>There are 2,596 people subject to banning orders, which prevent them from attending English or Welsh league grounds and from travelling to games outside the UK, either to follow national teams or club sides. Last August there were just 1,794. </p> <p>The increase in banning orders has been welcomed by police, who in the past felt magistrates courts were reluctant to use the full powers of the Football Disorder Act and exclude individuals who came before them on football-related charges. </p> <p>The figures also reflect the increase in intelligence-led anti-hooligan operations in the past 12 months, funded by a \u00a35m investment from the Home Office. </p> <p>Many forces have also made efforts to improve communications with supporters groups at local level, encouraging self-policing and establishing relationships with law-abiding fans that have helped them operate more effectively. </p> <p>The figures bear out the anecdotal evidence of a largely peaceful English presence at Euro 2004 in Portugal. There were only 76 England fans arrested in 2003-04, a reduction from 261 the previous season. Given that England took part in a major tournament, this is the most striking aspect. </p> <p>David Swift, deputy chief constable of Staffordshire police, who as the Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on footballing issues led the successful Euro 2004 operation, said effective policing was behind the decrease in arrests. </p> <p>\"Whilst I am pleased with the statistics we should not assume violence and disorder has gone away,\" he said. \"There has not been a massive reformation of trouble makers, rather rigorous controls and investigations by the police are having a positive effect. </p> <p>\"The last 12 months has seen a concerted effort by the police service to control behaviour at and around football games and to ban the maximum number of hooligans from attending future events. More than 1,200 new bans with most matches now trouble free, shows the tactics are working and they will be continued throughout this season.\" </p> <p>Caroline Flint, the Home Office minister responsible for anti-hooligan operations, welcomed the findings: \"These statistics paint a very encouraging picture ... It is also pleasing to see a fall in the number of arrests at England internationals reflecting the exemplary behaviour of the vast majority of fans in the run up to and during Euro 2004. </p> <p>\"However, the statistics reflect a lingering, if small, domestic disorder problem and we are not complacent. We will continue to ensure maximum use of the banning order legislation by providing ring-fenced funding to the police to proactively target known hooligans and maintain close international cooperation when England play away.\"</p>",
  "I was a fabulously naive 17-year-old, but even I could guess that when the Cambridge admissions tutor asks, \"Does your school realise this university has rather high standards?\" the interview is not going well. <p>My O-level grades weren't the best, but I'd won a national essay prize - \u00a3100 from the history dons of Peterhouse - so we both knew this comprehensive kid was some way off thick. </p> <p>He tapped his pencil against my application form. \"Father's occupation: unemployed.\" He regarded me over his specs. \"What business was he in?\" </p> <p>\"He was a school caretaker,\" I said. He smiled. \"I think we can consider this interview over. Don't you?\" </p> <p>I said: \"You let Raymond Williams in and his dad was a signalman.\" In my dreams. I wish I had. </p> <p>Running away down Jesus Lane I gulped back tears and thought: \"They can keep their bloody architecture.\" Then I remembered: back at the college was my coat, my wallet, my ticket home. I trudged back, gathered it up - and passed another office where at that moment I was supposed to be having my second interview, with the history don. I couldn't tell my teachers that I'd skipped it. </p> <p>The history man said he hadn't read my form; he didn't like to be swayed by preconceptions. He asked me about Henry Bolingbroke and Quentin Skinner and some other stuff that excited me back then. He didn't seem remotely interested in my dad. </p> <p>They let me in. </p> <p>I met few students from my kind of background - all of us white, by the way. Two fled and came back another year. One disappeared for good. I don't think it was the work that scared them off. The culture, maybe. Those drunken boys from first-rate schools who'd yell, \"Get your kit off!\" at the women, and \"debag\" the men, stripping them naked and pegging them to the croquet lawn. That kind of the thing. </p> <p>After I was elected college students' president on a platform of softer loo paper and more state school students, we lobbied the dons to let us produce a new prospectus aimed directly at state schools. </p> <p>One older fellow drawled: \"Come on, it's not as if we want to encourage applications from the children of dustmen.\" But we got our prospectus with help from more liberal dons, who then broadened its scope so as not to upset the prestige contacts. </p> <p>When we suggested they run summer schools for bright working-class kids, they laughed. They had no enthusiasm for the cause. And why would they? Many fellows considered undergraduates a distraction from the proper business of Cambridge, which was research. Requests that had to do with broadening access were met with the reply that \"social engineering\" wasn't their game. </p> <p>On Monday, the shadow minister for education, Tim Collins, will introduce a Commons debate on \"political interference in university admissions\". He'll make his usual complaint that universities are \"at the mercy of the government's attempts at social engineering\". </p> <p>He'll be echoing his former colleague Chris Patten, now chancellor of Oxford, who says the government's views on social engineering force universities to take students they don't want, and the rightwing De Montfort University don, Gary Day, who scorns \"social engineering\" and praises top-up fees as \"one Keep Out sign that really does work\" against the \"burger-munching multitude\". He'll also be echoing Michael Beloff, president of Trinity College, Oxford, who asserts that universities are \"not laboratories for social engineering\". </p> <p>\"Raw intelligence,\" Beloff says, \"is not enough for an Oxford course. It has to be developed to a particular point.\" </p> <p>Back in my college days, 20 years ago, the term \"social engineering\" struck my untuned ear as exactly what Cambridge was doing: encouraging rich parents to buy children of sometimes modest talents an unfair advantage in the world. </p> <p> Of course, the brightest public school kids were brilliant, as were the brightest kids from state schools. But the social ease, the assumed superiority that public schools teach, the veneer of cleverness they apply, helped to disguise less able students' banality. </p> <p>Bright kids pop up in all sorts of places - city comps, sink estates, every ethnic group. They don't all achieve perfect grades as teenagers. That doesn't mean they won't get a first class degree at 21. And if some working-class kids have Mr Beloff's \"raw intelligence\" but lack grooming, then I suggest he invites them on summer courses and sees how well they do. </p> <p>Around the time of my interview, a boy from Gordonstoun, called Edward, got a place with A-level grades that might qualify him for Stafford Poly, via the pool. Among the hobbies on his application he listed drama, skiing, and flying, too. Under \"parents' occupations\" he was able to write: \"Queen and Consort.\" </p> <p>Was this social engineering? I think so. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Clare Sambrook's first novel, Hide &amp; Seek, is published by Canongate in May 2005</p>",
  "Jack Straw yesterday moved to reassure Labour MPs and trade unions that he actively supports government plans to strengthen the law on corporate manslaughter, but is determined that change must be effective. <p>The foreign secretary acted after yesterday's Guardian reported him as trying to block the proposed draft bill because of \"serious problems\" which might make it better to maintain the status quo, despite concern that culpable corporate negligence has rarely been punished severely. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Straw telephoned Tony Dubbins, the TUC's point man on the issue, to assure him that he was \"committed\". The discussion was cordial, officials said. </p> <p>It emerged yesterday that Mr Straw, a barrister who wrote a paper in favour of reform when home secretary in 2000, is concerned in his current role that diplomats could become liable, under badly drafted legislation, for claims from overseas about foreign office advice that went wrong. </p> <p>Though officials offered no specific example, Mr Straw may have drawn lessons from the heavy criticism of the Foreign Office website's travel advisory note on Bali shortly before the 2002 nightclub bombings by Islamist terrorists. </p> <p>No 10 refused all comment but there was no attempt in Whitehall to deny that, as reported, Mr Straw had written to John Prescott, voicing practical doubts on behalf of his department. </p> <p>Suggestions that Mr Straw was acting in tandem with Gordon Brown were sharply rejected by both departments yesterday. Labour promised reform on the concept of corporate manslaughter in two manifestos and in its July deal with the unions at Warwick. </p> <p>The plan is for a draft bill to be produced for wider examination after the November 23 Queen's Speech. One idea being floated to protect public officials from legal attack is to distinguish between policy advice and factual advice - only faulty factual advice would leave them liable.</p>",
  "Some were shocked this week when two leading American neo-conservative thinkers, Irwin Stelzer and William Kristol, called our prime minister a \"neocon\"; but we shouldn't be. Tony Blair's pedigree as a neo-conservative has a long history. <p>On Radio 4 on Monday Irwin Stelzer defined neo-conservatism. On the domestic front, it supports a free market, but acknowledges a role for the welfare state. It is socially liberal. Blair, then, is a neocon at home. </p> <p>The controversial part, though, is the role it envisages for a government on the world stage. The argument goes that democracies don't fight one another, and that if powerful nations can increase the number of democratic regimes in the world, then they should. </p> <p>Up until 9/11 Blair's principal criticism of US foreign policy was that it wasn't engaged enough. When Bill Clinton prevaricated over ground troops for Kosovo in 1999, Blair complained: \"Americans are too ready to see no need to get involved in affairs of the rest of the world.\" </p> <p>George Bush did not share the neocon agenda when he took office. He proclaimed on the campaign trail that under him \"America doesn't do nation-building\". Since 9/11 it has been a different story. In his first major post-9/11 speech, at West Point in 2002, Bush declared: \"Our nation's cause has always been larger than our nation's defence.\" </p> <p>In almost identical terms to Bush's West Point speech, Blair was speaking of Britain's gift of values to the world, back in 1997 in his speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet: \"In the end I am, simply, a patriot. I believe in Britain ... because, at its best, it does stand for the right values and can give something to the world.\" </p> <p>It is the emphasis on \"values\" that links him to the neocons. Blair's formulation that, since the cold war, \"our actions are guided by ... mutual self-interest and moral purpose in defending the values we cherish. In the end values and interests merge\" is one that would be strongly supported by the neocons. </p> <p>The distinction between values and interests is crucial. Interests are usually defended, values are promoted. Interests are material and can be defined, values are hard to pin down and know no limit. If we take the government's oft repeated mantra that \"the best defence of our security lies in the spread of our values\", British foreign policy at once becomes diffuse: our priorities are everywhere and nowhere. </p> <p>What are these values? It is hard to disagree with Blair when he says: \"Nations that are free, democratic and benefiting from economic progress tend to be stable and solid partners in the advance of humankind.\" The problem occurs when British security is linked to the spread of those values, and when we wage war in their name. British national interest is explicitly located in the internal affairs of other countries, violating international traditions of non-interference, and destabilising governments. No wonder countries in the Middle East are nervous. </p> <p>I was studying in Chicago in 1999 when Blair argued for a \"doctrine of the international community\" legitimising humanitarian intervention in certain circumstances. The speech was well-received by leftwing fans of humanitarian intervention. But it was also seen as a seminal text by the rightwing interventionists at the University of Chicago and by neocons today. </p> <p>The speech contained five tests for intervention. Are we sure of the case? Have we exhausted all diplomatic options? Is the military option practical? Are we in it for the long term? Are national interests involved? It was seen at the time as a defence of humanitarian intervention against the background of Kosovo. But when even the second war on Iraq can be justified retrospectively as \"humanitarian\", it looks more like an argument for using force to make the world a \"better place\", wherever politically and financially possible. </p> <p>Where Blair departs from liberal interventionists and joins the neocons is the scope of his ambition. Humanitarian interest in military action stops at the achievement of the goal in question, whether stopping genocide in Serbia or removing Saddam. Blair's agenda is broader, almost imperial in scope. It is about using force to set examples. </p> <p>Speaking of Kosovo in the Chicago speech, he said: \"One of the reasons why it is now so important to win the conflict is to ensure that others do not make the same mistake in future ... we have to establish a new framework.\" This is the neocon philosophy in its purest form: war as the ultimate lever of change. The purpose of the war was to use force to establish the supremacy of our values. The same can be said of the war in Iraq. As one former US ambassador told me: \"The reason for the war in Iraq was to have a war.\" And the prime minister seems to agree. </p> <p>In Blair's words, what began as a unilateral war to enforce UN resolutions and disarm Saddam of WMD has been quietly transformed into \"the battle of seminal importance for the early 21st century\". According to Blair it is so important because this conflict \"will define relations between the Muslim world and the west\". </p> <p>Blair says that the terrorists in Iraq agree with him about the importance of the battle. A coalition victory would mean \"the death of the poisonous propaganda monster about America ... Lose the battle in Iraq and they lose the ability to present the Muslim world as victims and they as their champions\". If losing would mean giving the terrorists the upper hand in the battle for hearts and minds in the Muslim world, then this war really was, as the US National Security Strategy puts it, a clash \"inside a civilisation: a battle for the future of the Muslim world\". </p> <p>The neo-conservative thesis was always that the war on Iraq was part of the war on terror, that Afghanistan was not enough of a shock to shatter the confidence of states that would disobey the west. If we believe Blair's speeches after the war, paradigm change was part of the plan all along. To be clear, that means using military action as an instrument of foreign policy, not as a last resort. </p> <p>The slide into \"values\" as the determinant of foreign policy unequivocally allies the UK to the US. The prime minister said in 2002 that the price for US engagement in the world is that \"we don't shirk our responsibility. It means that when America is fighting for those values, then, however tough, we fight with her\". </p> <p>On this reading of UK policy, Blair would have sent troops into Vietnam. And based on this policy, the decision on whether or not the UK would wage war against Syria or Iran rests with the White House. </p> <p>Depending on your point of view, this may or may not be a good thing for the UK. But in the words of Blair himself: \"In the end, believe your political leaders or not, as you will. But do so at least having understood their minds.\" </p> <p>Blair is the original neocon. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ben Rawlence was foreign policy adviser to the Liberal Democrats 2002-2004.

  "Your report asserts that the foreign secretary doubts the need for a law to support the prosecution of negligent companies or employers (Straw tries to block law on death at work, October 22). If this is the case, Straw appears to be in conflict with Labour's Warwick agreement in July, and with his prime minister, who committed himself in his party conference speech to introduce a new law on corporate manslaughter. He is also at odds with the grieving relatives of the 1,500 and more people who have been killed at work since Labour's 1997 pledge to change the law. <p>In 1996 the Law Commission recommended that an offence of corporate killing should be enacted. In 1997, the government pledged to improve safety by ensuring that companies and directors can be held to account more easily for negligent or reckless conduct. </p> <p>Seven years on, the Health and Safety Executive estimates that up to 40% of workplace deaths have been as a result of serious management failures. The unions estimate that about 350 companies and organisations may have escaped prosecution by the failure to legislate. The Tories would certainly not act to bring in corporate killing laws, if they should ever make it back into government. The time has come for Labour to carry out its pledge and dispel the impression that the corporate world is somehow above justice. <br> <b>Tony Woodley</b> <br> General secretary, TGWU </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>In 1997, when I was a Labour parliamentary candidate, the Labour Party manifesto gave a commitment to create a new crime of corporate manslaughter. This was repeated by the home secretary at the recent party conference. British workers are denied the rights accorded to workers across the European Union. They are now asked to pay the continuing blood price for competitiveness. <br> <b>Prof Richard Ennals</b> <br> Kingston Business School </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>We yesterday launched a pilot project, Constructing Better Health, funded by the construction industry and government to improve the health of building workers. You can imagine our disappointment at doing so in the context of your story that the government may renege on its promise of a new law on corporate killing. </p> <p>Last year 71 people died in accidents on building sites, and over 700 died from asbestos-related diseases. Many employers work hard to create and maintain safe and healthy workplaces, but for those who don't the current law is inadequate. </p> <p>Let's see the draft corporate killing bill this autumn, as David Blunkett stated in his party conference speech just a couple of weeks ago. <br> <b>Lawrence Waterman</b> <br> President-elect, Institution of Occupational Safety and Health </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>When Jack Straw was home secretary in 2000, he published a consultation document proposing a new offence of corporate killing. Indeed, the consultation document he published was concerned with the accountability not only of companies, but also of their directors, and suggested reforms the current home secretary has now abandoned. </p> <p>It is also important to note that whether or not crown immunity should be lifted does not effect individual civil servants, since under existing law individual civil servants have no criminal immunity and they can be prosecuted for manslaughter if sufficient evidence exists. </p> <p>The issue of crown immunity is about whether or not crown bodies - such as government departments or other organisations controlled by the government - should be prosecuted. And on this, it is difficult to see why, for example, a private prison should be able to be prosecuted over a death of a prisoner, but not the prison service. <br> <b>David Bergman </b><br> Centre for Corporate Accountability  <b>Deborah Coles</b><br> Inquest</p>",
  "Britons will be asked whether tobacco companies should be forced to put shocking pictures on cigarette packets to illustrate the dire consequences of smoking-related diseases. <p>Images of smoke-damaged organs, clogged arteries, gangrenous legs and, more amusingly, a drooping cigarette to link the habit to impotence, were among 42 images published by the European commission yesterday as it launched the latest battle in the long war against smoking. </p> <p>Ireland, which has already banned smoking in public places, and Belgium are planning to introduce the measures, and British health ministers have indicated enthusiasm for the measure, which will be voluntary across the 25 member states. </p> <p>But the Department of Health said it was waiting for the commission to finally approve the list, probably by the end of the year. \"When that process is completed we will start on a consultation to see whether the pictures are a good idea and which ones are the most effective\", said a spokeswoman. Regulations would have to be laid before parliament. </p> <p>It is nearly two years since Alan Milburn, then health secretary, and his officials first signalled strong interest in the idea based on campaigns in Canada. The government moved more quickly than some EU countries on insisting on larger warning messages on packs and has financially supported graphic television and poster campaigns. </p> <p>Announcing a four-year \u20ac72m (\u00a350m) EU media campaign against smoking, David Byrne, the EU's health and consumer protection commissioner, said tobacco caused 650,000 deaths or one a minute in the EU. </p> <p>\"People need to be shocked out of their complacency about tobacco. I make no apology for some of the pictures we are using. The true face of smoking is disease, death and horror - not the glamour and sophistication the pushers in the tobacco industry try to portray.\" </p> <p>Mr Byrne, who leaves Brussels at the end of next week to become a World Health Organisation special envoy, said \"I would very strongly urge all 25 countries to use these as early as possible.\" </p> <p>Chris Davies, Lib Dem MEP, who successfully moved amendments to the 2001 tobacco products directive adopting the idea of using photos, said: \"A picture tells a thousand words. The images will evoke fear and disgust but the evidence from Canada suggests they will make a difference.\" </p> <p>Mr Byrne said a third of adults in the EU smoked compared with 22% in the US. \"The trends here are going downwards but not as much as I would like; we have to match and then surpass the achievements in the US.\" </p> <p>Ann McNeil, a senior research fellow at University College, London, part of a team of health experts that drew up a review of EU tobacco-control policy, said the annual cost of tobacco-related disease in the EU was a \"conservative\" \u20ac100bn (\u00a370bn), with 13 million suffering chronic disease. </p> <p>The team urged the EU to raise tobacco taxation significantly. Cigarettes, which cost as little as \u00a32 a pack in Luxembourg, are easily affordable for most EU consumers. </p> <p>Mr Byrne said the commission was considering plans to exclude tobacco from consumer price indexes which measure inflation because of its distorting effect. Finance ministers were reluctant to raise taxes and, hence, cigarette prices because of their inflationary impact. He backed calls by the expert panel for tougher controls on the \"ruthless\" tobacco industry. </p> <p>Chris Ogden, director for trade and industry affairs at the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association, said the picture blitz was \"somewhat unnecessary bearing in mind the population ... is well aware of the health risks of smoking and for the last two years there have been large written warnings on packs.\" Images normally confined to medical journals \"are not the way forward\", he said. </p> <p>Forest, the smokers' lobby group, predicted smokers would get \"warning fatigue\". Simon Clark, its director, said: \"These images are gratuitously offensive ... What about fatty foods, dairy products or alcohol? If they're going to target tobacco, there should be graphic warnings on other products too.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lady Young takes her environmental responsibilities pretty personally. She buys organic food, her garden in Bedfordshire has a composter as \"big as the moon\" and she travelled 55,000 miles last year by train to avoid more polluting air travel. </p> <p>But even the straight-talking chief executive of the Environment Agency is forced to compromise occasionally. To satisfy her own weakness for ornithology, the former head of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds flew on holiday to Papua New Guinea. \"You can't see birds of paradise in Cornwall,\" she explains. </p> <p>Young has few other such weaknesses, one suspects. The hard-driven Scot has cleaned up the Environment Agency's own nest and hugely increased its external profile. The \"non-departmental public body\" - with its 11,500 staff and an annual budget of \u00a3850m - will be back in the spotlight on Tuesday as it opens its third annual conference in Birmingham. </p> <p>Young has already guaranteed a lively level of debate by biting a lump out of some of the UK's bluest-chip companies, such as British Energy, Rolls-Royce and Thames Water. </p> <p>The agency comprehensively named and shamed them for their environmental shortcomings in a controversial summer report. In return, employers' body the CBI claimed that \"poor design and heavy-handed enforcement\" of environmental regulations was costing British business \u00a34bn a year. </p> <p>Immaculately decked out in autumnal colours - all nutty-brown suit and flashes of gold jewellery - the cross-bench peer defends her actions at the agency's Millbank offices high above the Thames. </p> <p><strong> No deterrent</strong><br> </p> <p>\"We call it fame, name and shame. We celebrate where the sectors are improving overall and within each sector we have got the companies that are doing very well - we name them - and those that are doing badly, we name them as well.\" </p> <p>The chemicals sector is picked out for praise but she is happy to run through the stragglers again: \"The agricultural sector - there is still some way to go. We are disappointed by the water sector. They are doing lots of good stuff - cleaning up water, that's what they are about - but there are still too many pollution incidents, and the construction sector - we really have work to do there.\" </p> <p>As for the \u00a34bn figure, she argues that the CBI should be triumphant because it shows that Britain has the cheapest price for environmental law implementation across Europe. </p> <p>\"It was not a great [CBI] report. They got their figures round their neck on several points, which I think they would admit now,\" the chief executive explains. </p> <p>But it is far from all-out war between the two sides. The CBI privately admits to grudging respect for Young, while she believes the world of commerce is more content than it lets on. \"I have this thing called my gripe-ometer, my gripe-ogram, which basically lists all the things that businesses say they are unhappy about, and we have done some analysis to see what the causes of that are. </p> <p>\"Some of it will be about the way we do our work, but much of it is about the way in which environmental regulation comes from Europe and is implemented in the UK.\" </p> <p>Young also has the respect of green groups but some still feel that business is being let off too lightly. Companies might be named or shamed but what, they ask, is a fine of \u00a310,000 to Rolls-Royce? </p> <p>\"No deterrent whatsoever,\" Young agrees. \"We are doing a bit of work as part of the Hampton review [on the enforcement of regulations] and also generally to see if we can persuade people that there should be a more flexible range of fines, not just related to criminal offences. </p> <p>\"At the moment the only thing you can do in terms of a company is fine it - it is the only remedy. What we would like to see is some administrative and civil penalties applied much more quickly. </p> <p>\"The problem with the Spotlight [naming and shaming] report is that it's often a couple of years between the time of the offence, the investigation, the prosecution and the report; by which time managers have moved on, companies might have been bought and sold, and it does not feel like a swift process - that if you get it wrong you take your medicine.\" </p> <p>Young has been looking at alternative solutions following visits to the United States. She is particularly interested in the way companies over there have to make up for lapses through environmental remedy and improvement. </p> <p>This helps to rebuild the reputation of companies as well as \"heal\" problems caused to local communities, she believes. </p> <p>But there have been complaints from the environmental lobby in Britain that the agency has not got the resources to enforce its own rules. Does she agree? </p> <p>\"Clearly no public body has got all the money it would like,\" says Young, but she accepts that government funding will continue to be squeezed and is looking at other ways to raise cash. </p> <p><strong> Business mythology</strong><br> </p> <p>A tax on landfill sites currently goes back to companies to help them comply with regulations but Young would like some of that money to go back to her agency. </p> <p>Another way of dealing with money shortage is to make her own organisation more efficient. She is already proud of saving \u00a3118m under a three-year productivity drive and has another three-year programme that is almost as large. </p> <p>Despite her stints as BBC vice-chairwoman and a non-executive on the board of Anglian Water, some businessmen feel she might not have the hard commercial experience to really improve the agency or understand companies properly. She, naturally, demurs. </p> <p>\"Charities are in the not-for-profit sector but my god they have to make their money. We doubled the size of the RSPB and tripled the income. You have got to understand what profit looks like. </p> <p>\"And of course I did 20 years of cost-reduction in the National Health Service. There is a kind of mythology that unless you are from business you can't understand what business wants. </p> <p>\"I don't think that's the case. About 25% of our staff come from a business background.\" </p> <p><strong> Renewables v nuclear</strong><br> </p> <p>The agency might need more cash as it pushes into important new areas. These include public health issues in poorer communities, such as \"diffuse\" pollution in air, soil and water. </p> <p>Working closely with local authorities could come soon, as well as tackling controversial areas such as aviation, road and rail, plus more obvious ones connected with global warming, such as flooding. </p> <p>Young has already visited Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast, where the local river blasted a huge hole in its banks, triggering dire warnings that the east coast town would soon be under water. </p> <p>\"John Gummer [the local MP] is over-egging it,\" she argues, but accepts that the problems raised are serious. \"The options for Aldeburgh are being discussed and I don't honestly believe we won't be protecting Aldeburgh. </p> <p>\"There is no way it would be just let go. But there will be other bits, which are primarily rural and agricultural, where there is not going to be the cost benefit to make it a sensible proposition. </p> <p>\"On top of that, I don't think anyone wants the whole of the east coast to be behind a bloody great wall.\" </p> <p>There are chunks of the east coast that are going to have to be defended, says Young, who does not want to see Suffolk's coastal nuclear power station, Sizewell, \"go bang in a big way\". </p> <p>The agency has more than a passing interest in atomic power: it is the regulator of nuclear waste. </p> <p>But Young has watched with horror as the nuclear lobby has begun to flex its muscles amid fears of a future energy shortage. \"If everyone has the idea in the back of their mind that nuclear is going to come back in the frame, there will never be enough welly behind renewables. </p> <p>\"The market is going to be tremendously difficult to promote and prompt. If there is the slightest hint it might get the rug pulled out from under it, it will just never happen.\" </p> <p>With fears growing about a looming energy crunch, the atomic power lobby is on the warpath, pushing its case for modernisation and expansion. But it will clearly find itself with a certain battling baroness to contend with. </p> <p>\"In the 10 to 15 years when it will be a bit thought-provoking to be as reliant on imported gas as we'll be, then I think losing our nerve and plumping for the nuclear option is not a sensible proposition.\"</p>",
  "The Russian parliament yesterday voted to ratify the Kyoto treaty, bringing the international climate change protocol to within months of coming into effect. <p>The lower house of the parliament, or duma, yesterday voted 334-73 to approve the treaty. This means that the protocol's 126 signatories have eight years to cut their emissions of six greenhouse gases to 5.2% below their 1990 levels. </p> <p>The treaty needs 55 industrialised nations, representing 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, to sign it before it can come into effect. </p> <p>The United States, responsible for 36% of emissions in 1990, and Australia, have already refused to sign up to the measure, meaning Russia had to ratify the treaty to save it from collapse. The move will be seen as a sign that Moscow is keen to curry favour with Brussels after the bruising attacks on human rights abuses by the EU in recent months. </p> <p>The bill now has to pass through the more pliant upper house of parliament, the federation council, and then be signed into law by President Vladimir Putin, the bill's main advocate. The parliament, where the pro-Putin United Russia party commands a two-thirds majority, was perhaps the only possible impediment to the bill becoming law. The treaty will come into effect 90 days after it is ratified by Russia. </p> <p>Mr Putin prevaricated over the bill, saying that Russia would only sign it if it was in the national interest and suggesting it would need modifying. His key adviser on the issue, Andrei Illarionov, made Russia's vital ratification of the pact seem unlikely when he described it as an \"economic Auschwitz\", insisting it would cripple Russian economic development. </p> <p>However Mr Putin publicly announced he would ratify the treaty after a meeting with EU officials in May, on the same day as the EU dropped its objections to Russia joining the World Trade Organisation. </p> <p>Mr Putin said at the time: \"The fact that the European Union has met us halfway at the negotiations on membership in the WTO cannot but influence Moscow's positive attitude towards ratification of the Kyoto protocol.\" </p> <p>Mikhail Delyagin, head of the Institute for Globalisation Problems and a former government economic adviser, said the move was \"a purely political step\". He said the EU's emphasis on human rights could have led to a \"storm of criticism in Europe\" over Mr Putin's recent political reforms, enabling him to appoint regional governors and further increasing his strength in parliament. </p> <p>\"Signing Kyoto is a bone thrown to Europe to make them shut up,\" he said. </p> <p>He added that Russia had a chance to receive \"serious economic advantages\" from the treaty. Russia's industry does not produce the carbon emissions it did in the early 90s, and the government will be able to sell on to other countries its \"carbon credits\" under the treaty's limits because of these reduced emissions. </p> <p>But he said Russian governmental incompetence meant the market had been created without taking into account Russia's interests. \"Western Europe will now first buy from eastern European countries, and then Ukraine, with Russia last. There will be very few benefits to Russia.\"</p> <p><b>Terms and conditions</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The protocol obliges industrialised countries to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by an average 5.2% from 1990 levels by 2012<br><br><b>\u00b7</b> To take effect, the accord must be ratified by 55 countries responsible for 55% of greenhouse gas emissions<br><br> <b>\u00b7</b> The US rejected the protocol in 2001, saying it would harm its economy and unfairly favoured developing countries.

  "<p>Marc Antony knew a thing or two about human nature. As he said, with a little help from Shakespeare, in Julius Ceasar: \"The evil that men do lives after them; but the good is oft interred with their bones.\" </p> <p>Now, until the end of next month, some 2,000 solicitors are offering us a chance to make sure that the \"good\" will live on after we are gone. Instead of charging their normal fee for drawing up a basic will participating solicitors have agreed to waive their normal charges to support Will Aid, a fundraising campaign that supports leading UK charities. Rather, your solicitor will suggest a donation of \u00a365 for a single will, \u00a395 for a pair of wills or \u00a335 for a codicil to an existing will. </p> <p>The idea is to raise funds for the nine nominated charities that include the NSPCC the British Red Cross, Christian Aid, Help the Aged, Save the Children UK and Sight Savers International. </p> <p>TV star Graham Norton, who is backing the Will Aid campaign, says: \"None of us like to think about the Grim Reaper but eventually he calls on us all, and that's why everyone should have a proper will. It's the only way of ensuring that the people you love are provided for and that your hard earned assets don't go to some unpleasant distant relative or worse, the taxman. </p> <p>\"Cohabiting couples have precious few inheritance rights and if one partner dies without a will, the other may be left with nothing - not even the shared home. So in their case it is doubly important to have a professionally drawn will. By making your will you are not only caring for your loved ones and making sure you don't leave them in the lurch, but you are also ensuring a better life for people who depend on the Will Aid charities.\" </p> <p> A recent survey of nearly 34,000 adults aged between 25 and 64 showed that only 24% of people aged 25-44 have an up-to date will. Almost 50% of women and men aged 45-64 have not bothered to update their wills. Moreover among this age group, 64% of women and 72% of men are married and 79% are homeowners with over 50% of them having dependent children and/or stepchildren living at home. </p> <p>With an eye on the civil partnership bill, Will Aid asked respondents for their views on changes to the law and how inheritance issues might be affected. The civil partnership bill creates a new legal status that would allow adult same-sex couples to gain formal recognition of their relationship. </p> <p>The overwhelming response among the people polled by Will Aid is that all couples in long-term relationships should share the rights of married couples (72%) and 64% of those polled said that people should not have to marry to enjoy those rights. </p> <p>Most cohabiting people know that their partner will not automatically inherit should they die without a will and yet only 22% of those living with a partner have an up-to-date will. </p> <p>Even where couples are married, life after death for the surviving spouse is not that simple. Most married people assume that their spouse would inherit all their assets if they died without leaving a will. </p> <p>In fact, there are limits on what husbands and wives can inherit from each other, depending on whether or not there are children and other surviving relatives. As things stand the surviving spouse may only inherit up to \u00a3125,000 in England and Wales and in some cases may have to sell the family home to pay off other relatives. </p> <p>It is important to remember that under current tax regime, inheritance tax (IHT) is payable at 40% on estates over \u00a3263,000. A properly drawn will, together with professional tax advice, are the key factors in ensuring that you do not overpay on IHT. </p> <p>The dramatic increase in property prices means that more and more people have assets that take them over the IHT threshold. </p> <p>According to estimates from Halifax Financial Services, the number of properties in the UK valued at more than the IHT threshold increased by almost 500,000 in the first half of 2004, with an estimated 2.4m homeowners potentially liable to IHT as a result. Add to this amount other savings or investments, including life insurance policies, and many more people will go over the threshold. Do remember though, that you are only liable for tax on the balance above \u00a3263,000, not the entire estate. </p> <p>Of course you do not have to use a lawyer to draw up a will. You can pop into your local stationers where you can buy a DIY will pack for around a tenner. </p> <p>If the will is signed and witnessed by two people who are not themselves beneficiaries, it should be legally valid. However Which, the consumers' rights publication, recommends that you take professional legal advice if you have remarried or have children from previous marriage, or have assets abroad. Legal advice is crucial if you are responsible for looking after someone with disabilities or the sum of your estate exceeds the IHT threshold. </p> <p>For a free Will Aid pack with a list of participating solicitors call <strong>0870 606 0239</strong> or go to <a href=\"http://www.willaid.org.uk  \">www.willaid.org.uk </a></p>",
  "<p>The great thing about the NiteMates Lighted slippers wasn't so much that they had hi-tech, contoured lenses for maximum illumination - although those obviously represented a remarkable technological advance over previous slippers. No, it was that they were upholstered in a plush terry-cloth material for your comfort.</p> <p>\"I've still got a pair in a box somewhere,\" says Nick Biggs, the copywriter who supplied the Innovations catalogue with its masterly product blurbs. \"They're very well-made. Really comfy.\" Plus they help you see in front of your feet in the dark, a boon in the admittedly unlikely event that you can't find a light switch or torch. \"That's right,\" says Biggs. Has he ever used them? \"Only once. I lost my torch and I needed to go into the loft, so I held one of them in my hand. Very useful. Never really used them as they were intended, though.\"</p> <p>Biggs's hi-tech, open-toed slippers appear on the cover of a new book entitled The Very Best Of The Innovations Catalogue, a homage to those heady days when glow-in-the-dark golf balls and LavaBuns (the eight-hour heated cushion, only \u00a337.50, great for hitherto numb-bummed fishermen) were must-haves for many delightfully misguided Britons.</p> <p>In fact, there were two types of full-beam slippers: the open-toed, backless ones favoured by Biggs, and the car-shaped ones made of plush red Dacron (80%) and cotton (20%), with nonslip PVC soles, favoured by small boys. Of the latter, the catalogue entry points out: \"When you step into them, those powerful headlights are automatically switched on, safely lighting your way in the dark.\" Sweet.</p> <p>That was one of the extraordinary, if utterly decadent, things the Innovations catalogue did in its pomp: it created irrepressible desires for things that you didn't hitherto know that you needed; desires that would be stilled only when you had shelled out the wherewithal for them. Just before the goods arrived, it is true, you might have realised the error of your purchase, but it would be, in a very real sense, too late.</p> <p>The car-shaped slippers were a snip at \u00a319.95. Only one problem: there was no facility to dip your slipper headlights when you passed other slipper drivers on the landing. Did no one think of the consequences? For a start there would be nasty shag pile-ups (with the attendant risks of carpet burn) and potentially blinding nocturnal dazzle. Horrible when you think about it.</p> <p>In today's more judgmental age, Trinny and Susannah might well counsel that you shouldn't wear fullbeam open-toed slippers at all (still less with argyle socks underneath), but who cares? The heyday of the Innovations catalogue, which was roughly from 1990 to 2003 (when the magazine was briefly withdrawn, only to resurface as a website under new management, at the end of last year), was a time when some of us bought things that married extraordinary comfort to equally amazing ingenuity, and to hell with the opprobrium of fashionistas. Happier times, really.</p> <p>That's why people bought things such as the Trouser Robe (\u00a339.99), whose jumpsuit styling meant that it didn't gape open lewdly or let in draughts like those rubbish bathrobes you might steal from hotels. \"Much more respectable when guests arrive unexpectedly!\" pronounced the catalogue wisely. The machine-washable, super-thick cotton towelling robes came with a roll-up collar that could double as a hood to dry hair, which you have to admit is quite brilliant.</p> <p>But nothing, so far as I can judge, could explain the purchase of the so-called Glamour Suspender Stockings (three-pair pack, \u00a39.95). The catalogue described them thus: \"Fashionable, hygienic and sensual - the new stockings with built-in suspenders that you put on and take off like tights.\" Sensual? Hygienic?</p> <p>That was the thing about the Innovations catalogue: the input of brainpower into product design was in inverse proportion to the justifiableness of said product, at a time when you might think big-brained inventors should - just a thought - be curing cancer, creating commercially viable alternatives to fossil fuel, and so on. Instead, they were being used to devise such things as the Ribetting Frog Phone (\u00a344.99). This was a plastic frog who sat on a plastic rock waiting for your call. \"And when it comes he informs you with a hilarious electronic 'Ribet! Ribet!'\" That's right, \"hilarious\". Got a problem with that?</p> <p>Biggs, 49, spent 13 years making these products come to life in his captions. He made it seem essential that you buy a phone that allowed you to reply with one of a range of 16 voices (man, woman, Alex Ferguson - only joking about the last one). He was the man who convinced us that if you had a sagging chin, you could work it off in the Chin Gym (\u00a339.95). He was the man who made us order the Securi-Gnome for \u00a379.95, because he convinced us that when the 18in high plastic monstrosity (with its cunningly disguised PIR body heat censor, whatever that is) was on duty in your front garden, you could sleep easily.</p> <p>Did this work drive him just a little bit bonkers? \"Not really,\" replies Biggs evenly. \"I'm emphatically a gadget nut, you see. I was quite proud to be working on the catalogue, because the gadgets were really cool.\" Even the electronic pillbox that came with its own supply of water? \"Yes, even that.\" And the levitating pen? \"Right.\"</p> <p>Clearly Biggs had fun writing the captions. One has the following headline: \"Any pen can write. This one talks, too ...\" How could you not read on? \"Why do the most brilliant ideas always seem to occur when you're away from your desk? The Pencorder is the world's first writing instrument with a built-in digital recorder. Using advanced customised semi-conductor chips, it holds up to 40 seconds of speech - and plays it back with telephone clarity via a miniature loudspeaker.\" A steal at \u00a399.95.</p> <p>But sometimes Biggs went too far. \"Sleeve Holders are back!\" he wrote in one giddy moment, and carried on in the same vein. \"Sleeve Holders have come right back into fashion - and they're still the most practical way to keep your sleeves up! These attractive gold and silver coloured metal Sleeve Holders look great with any shirt, blouse, or jacket, and are especially useful with today's baggy sweaters.\" Barmy. Mind you, only \u00a37.95 for two pairs.</p> <p>And yet, at his best, Biggs prodded our secret anxieties with cunningly manipulative prose. \"Ever had the sneaking suspicion that your breath isn't quite as fresh as you'd want?\" he wrote. \"Then this little device is a discreet way to check. Simply breathe on to the tiny glass censor, and after five seconds the BreathAlert gives a guide in four grades (from None to Strong) so you can take action if necessary. Small enough for pocket or purse.\" Only \u00a319.99 (batteries supplied). You want one, don't you?</p> <p>But arguably the best product that ever appeared in the Innovations catalogue was the one Biggs wrote up as \"The bin that's almost too good for rubbish!\" He went on: \"\u00a389.99 for a waste bin? Sounds a lot, but then this is far from an ordinary bin. For a start, it's made entirely from solid mahogany.\" It measured 13in x 11in x 8in, which is big, certainly big enough for all the stuff I'm getting rid of - frog phone, chin gym, several pairs of \"glamour stockings\". But not, of course, the one-touch electric pepper grinder (\u00a319.99) with a built in light that illuminates your plate so you don't dispense too much.

  "<p>This is the final selection of recipes from Casa Moro, the new cookbook by Sam and Sam Clark, in which they explore the cooking of Spain, Morocco and Lebanon, bringing the flavours of those linked but very different cultures within easy reach of the domestic cook. Wonderful though these recipes are, they are only a taster for the dishes in the book, which are full of rich flavours, warmth and pleasure. As the Clarks say, \"We are interested in a sense of place with our food, that place being the street or home. This book therefore prefers to be at home, for there is no substitute for the love and care of the home cook.\" </p> <p><strong>Besugo al horno</strong><br> Baked bream with potatoes and tomatoes - bream cooked this way is a traditional Spanish Christmas dish. It's easy to make and a treat to eat. The method also works well with cod or hake steaks or filleted sea bass - these take about 15 minutes less to cook, so roast the other ingredients for 15-20 minutes before you cook the fish. Serves four. </p> <p>2 bream (red, golden or black), each big enough for two (ie around 500g), scaled and gutted<br> Sea salt and black pepper<br> 4 large Cyprus potatoes (about 1kg), sliced into rounds 3mm thick<br> 2 medium red onions, thinly sliced<br> 6 medium sweet tomatoes (or 12-18 cherry tomatoes), sliced into rounds about 5mm thick<br> 2 garlic cloves, crushed to a paste with salt<br> 2 bayleaves (preferably fresh), halved<br> 6 tbsp olive oil<br> A few parsley stalks<br> 4 slices lemon<br> half fennel bulb, finely chopped (or half tbsp fennel seeds)<br> </p> <p>To serve </p> <p>2 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped<br> 1 lemon, quartered<br> </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Season the fish inside and out. Lightly salt the potatoes. Put the onions, potatoes, tomatoes, garlic and bayleaves in a mixing bowl. Pour on half the olive oil, season well and toss together. Stuff the cavity of each fish with parsley stalks, lemon and fennel. Cover the base of a very large, roomy roasting tray with half the onion, potato and tomato mixture. Place the bream on top, then cover with the rest of the vegetables. Drizzle over the remaining oil, and roast in the middle of the oven for 35 minutes, or until cooked. Scatter with parsley and serve with lemon quarters and a salad. </p> <p><strong>Lamb mechoui with cumin and paprika salt</strong><br> </p> <p>The last time we were in Marrakech, we visited a market 15km outside the city. Against a backdrop of the snow-covered Atlas mountains, we wandered around with our guide, Khalid, for what seemed like hours. When we stopped for lunch, we were given a bowl of steaming chickpeas with calf's feet by a friend of his who ran the oldest 'restaurant' in the market. While we were scooping up this gelatinous stew with bread, we noticed a man ask the owner to grill him some chops he'd just bought from a butcher. Simply sprinkled with cumin, salt and paprika, they were grilled over charcoal and served with a small pile of extra cumin salt on the side, and bread. 'This is real mechoui,' Khalid said. He was referring to the famous mechoui of whole lambs spit-roasted over the embers of an open fire, basted with a mixture of butter, saffron, cumin, salt and paprika. Still feeling a little hungry ourselves, we, too, went off to buy some chops for him to grill for us. Serves four. </p> <p>2 tbsp cumin seeds, freshly ground<br> 1 tsp sweet paprika<br> half tsp hot paprika<br> 1 tbsp sea salt, roughly crumbled<br> 12-16 lamb chops, depending on size<br> 40g butter, melted<br> </p> <p>In a bowl, mix together the spices and salt. Just before you are ready to cook the chops, brush them with melted butter, sprinkle with half the cumin mixture and grill or griddle for five to eight minutes on each side. Serve immediately with the remaining cumin salt on the side. This is delicious on its own with bread and/or a Moroccan salad. </p> <p>Variation: instead of chops, you could cover a whole shoulder of lamb with the spice mix and roast it at 160C/325F/gas mark 3 for four to five hours, until the meat is falling off the bone. Keep basting the meat with the buttery, spicy juices. Serve with extra cumin salt on the side. </p> <p><strong>Chicken fattee with rice, crispbread and yogurt</strong><br> </p> <p>This is a glorious layered dish from Lebanon, ideally suited to sharing at home with family and friends. As there are so many simple components in this dish, one chicken goes a long way. In Lebanon, the bird is poached rather than roasted. Serves eight. </p> <p>For the chicken </p> <p>1 medium organic or free-range chicken, about 1.5kg<br> 3 tbsp olive oil<br> Sea salt and black pepper<br> Quarter tsp cloves, ground<br> </p> <p>For the tomato sauce </p> <p>5 tbsp olive oil<br> 5 garlic cloves, sliced<br> 4cm cinnamon stick<br> 2x400g tins plum tomatoes, drained and the tomatoes squashed well<br> </p> <p>For the rice </p> <p>300g basmati rice, unwashed<br> Sea salt<br> 75g butter<br> 4cm cinnamon stick<br> half a large onion, halved and thinly sliced<br> 485ml water or chicken stock<br> 400g tin cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed<br> </p> <p>For the crispbread </p> <p>25g butter<br> 2 pitta breads<br> </p> <p>For the fried aubergine </p> <p>2 medium aubergines, cut into 3cm cubes and tossed with 1 tsp salt<br> 8 tbsp olive oil<br> </p> <p>To finish </p> <p>500g Greek yogurt, mixed with a clove of garlic crushed with salt<br> 8 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped<br> 75g pine nuts, very lightly toasted or fried in olive oil until golden<br> </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Rub two tablespoons of olive oil all over the chicken, season with salt and pepper, and sprinkle the ground cloves on top. Oil a baking tray with the remaining oil, then add the chicken and roast for about an hour and a quarter, basting every now and then, until the juices run clear (check after an hour, then every 15 minutes or so, as you don't want to overcook it). Transfer the bird to a board to rest for 10 minutes, loosely covered with foil. Meanwhile, deglaze the roasting tray - pour off most of the oil, place the tray over medium heat, add 150ml water and bring to a gentle simmer. Tip in the juices from the cavity of the chicken, then scrape up any caramelised bits on the base of the tray and check for seasoning. Add more water if the gravy is too strong. </p> <p>When the chicken is cool enough to handle, take the meat off the bone and slice into manageable pieces. Keep warm until you are ready to serve. </p> <p>Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the garlic until light brown. Add the cinnamon and tomatoes, simmer for half an hour, then season well. Keep the sauce warm. </p> <p>Rub the rice in three changes of cold water to wash off the starch. Cover with warm water, stir in the salt and soak for 30-60 minutes. Melt the butter over a medium heat and add the cinnamon and onion. Fry for 10-15 minutes until golden brown, stirring every now and then. Remove from the heat and set aside. </p> <p>To make the crispbread, melt the butter over a low heat. Heat the pittas in the oven for a couple of minutes, then split them in half lengthways and brush on both sides with melted butter. Place on a board and slice each half in half again lengthways, then cut each piece into four or five triangles. Place on a rack and bake in the middle of the oven for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown and crisp. </p> <p>About 15 minutes before you are ready to eat, place the onion pan over a high heat, drain the rice and stir into the onions. Fry, stirring, for a minute. Add the water (or stock) and the chickpeas. Add salt (about half a teaspoon) and cover with either baking parchment or foil followed by a lid. Boil fast for five minutes, then turn the heat to low-medium for a further five minutes. At this point, the rice should be cooked, but it will sit happily for 15 minutes. </p> <p>Rinse the salt off the aubergines, then dry with kitchen paper. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan or wok over a medium to high heat, then fry the aubergine until soft and brown. Cover and keep warm. </p> <p>Now you just have to layer things up on one or more big platters or serving dishes. Everything needs to be hot apart from the crispbread and yogurt. The order to layer your plate is first the crispbread, then the rice, then the chicken and its gravy (about four to five tablespoons), then the aubergine, then a scattering of tomato sauce, then a little yogurt and finally lots of chopped parsley and the pine nuts.

  "<p>Where have all the leaders gone? Awol is the answer, according to a study this week which shows that most of us despair of meeting a manager who also qualifies as a leader. </p> <p>The study by the Chartered Management Institute argues that a lack of inspiration stifles UK businesses. It says workers and line managers are calling out for corporate leaders who inspire their staff. But a survey by the institute shows that fewer than four employees in 10 claim to see any evidence of inspiring leadership at work. </p> <p>The report, Inspired Leadership, An Insight Into People Who Inspire Exceptional Performance, identifies the three main characteristics that employees long to see. Genuine shared vision from executives mattered to 79% of the workers polled, with 77% saying that they would like to see their leaders showing confidence and trust in staff teams. Some 73% of the respondents were seeking respect from line managers and customers. </p> <p>The single most important factor that a majority of employees would like to see in their leader is \"inspiration\". However, only one in 10 respondents felt that they witnessed this elusive quality at work. </p> <p>Six out of 10 employees in the study, which was commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), reported that their managing director or chief executive was out of touch with how staff feel. Only 40% said the head of their organisation chatted to employees and fewer than one-fifth (19%) experienced an open-door policy. </p> <p>Nigel Crouch, a consultant working in the DTI's innovation unit, says: \"In the incredibly fast-changing world in which we all operate today, the really successful organisations are those that innovate most effectively. And the key to effective innovation is genuinely involving as many of your people as possible in how you take the business forward together, which requires truly inspirational leadership from the top team down.\" </p> <p>Among the corporate leaders identified by the DTI is Mark Constantine, chief executive and co-founder of Lush, the natural cosmetics business. The hand-made beauty products chain opened its first shop in Poole, Dorset, in 1994, with a second one in London soon after. Today Lush has more than 100 outlets and mail order operations in Canada, Australia, Italy and Japan. </p> <p>Mr Constantine says: \"At Lush everyone is allowed to have ideas, not just the senior management team. I ask everyone on the shop floor to tell us how to do things better, and respect what they have to say. Then I provide the resources to ensure that the solutions are delivered. </p> <p>\"My idea is to give our people the freedom and support to get on with their job. For example, store managers control their own budgets and all staff have the freedom to test new ideas and ways of working. This may sound like a load of soft soap but I believe that the challenge for today's business leaders is to provide a working environment where people can realise their full potential.\" </p> <p><strong>&amp;#183</strong>Achieving Best Practice Inspirational Leadership Guide is available free from the DTI if you call <strong>0870-150-2500</strong> quoting ref URN 04/1085.

  "<p>Treasury select committee member Norman Lamb is to organise crisis meetings with regulators over the lack of help for most precipice bond victims. </p> <p>His decision follows this week's \u00a3300,000 fine by watchdog the Financial Services Authority (FSA), on financial advice group Capita Trust Company for mis-selling precipice bonds. Capita, part of the group that administers London's congestion charge, will also pay \u00a33.5m compensation to 500 victims - an average \u00a37,000 per head. </p> <p>Precipice bonds paid fixed and guaranteed income - typically a high and well flagged 10% - for three or five years. But the return of savers' capital depended on complicated share market index calculations. Many bonds lost all or some of the original cash. </p> <p>Mr Lamb says: \"I have been heartened by this week's FSA fine on Capita. And it is good to see at least one more firm holding up its hands and admitting to past mis-selling. It is more evidence of the tough stance the regulator is now taking,\" says the Liberal Democrat MP. </p> <p>But there are many hundreds of thousands more who deserve compensation, according to Mr Lamb. </p> <p>\"The Capita decision, and the far bigger \u00a3100m package of fines and compensation imposed on Lloyds TSB late last year, were both to do with face to face advice. Yet the bulk of precipice bonds were sold by mailshot. And the losers here have generally been ignored,\" he says. </p> <p>As the case of Katherine Kirk (see right) makes clear, many complaints are turned down because there was no face to face discussion and hence, according to the FSA and the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), buyers purchased without advice - known as \"execution only\". </p> <p>But in most cases, victims received literature which highlighted the high income but downplayed the risk of capital loss. To claim mis-selling, victims had to show the sales material was misleading - this was proven in the case of some material from bust advice firm David M Aaron. But complaints about many other IFA firms have been rejected. </p> <p>\"Taken in isolation, these complaints often fail on an apparent lack of advice. It suggests they were bought with less marketing effort by the IFA than a supermarket gives to the selling of a tin of baked beans. But the precipice bond product was fundamentally flawed for the target audience of largely retired people,\" Mr Lamb says. </p> <p>He will hold meetings with the leader of the FSA's continuing investigation into precipice bond sales, and with FOS chief Walter Merricks. \"My main hope is to persuade the FSA to get really tough. Without that, the FOS will continue to reject complaints in the way Ms Kirk's has already been turned down,\" he adds. </p> <p>Ms Kirk recently visited Mr Lamb at the House of Commons. She says the amount she has lost is relatively small and \"not life threatening\". </p> <p>\"I'm putting my head above the parapet because so many other people have lost either sums they cannot afford or really big amounts in the tens or even hundreds of thousands or sometimes all their savings. I want to highlight this disgraceful mis-selling of an unfit investment product,\" she says. </p> <p>\"It's a matter of principle. My last FOS rejection letter did little other than repeat what the IFA had said. It copied out great chunks of the literature. It ignored why I had complained completely,\" she adds. </p> <p>Capita Trust, which will have to lay out \u00a33.8m in fines and compensation, was previously known as Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Trust. R&amp;SA Trust, bought by Capita in May 2001, specialised in advising former R&amp;SA employees. </p> <p>It advised 500 customers to invest in 50 different precipice bonds. In the sample 60 files examined by the FSA, all showed the firm had \"failed to take reasonable steps to ensure its customers understood the nature of the risks in the product.\" </p> <p>But even though the FSA told the firm in August 2001 that there were serious deficiencies in its sale processes, it continued to sell bonds for a further year without changing its processes. </p> <p>\"It is essential higher risk products be promoted with great care and the risks must be clearly and unambiguously explained to customers,\" says FSA enforcement director Andrew Procter. </p> <p>\"I shall suggest to the FSA that Mr Procter's statement should apply to firms which sold by mailshot as well as those which gave face to face advice,\" says Mr Lamb. </p> <p><strong>Case study: They shouldn't be allowed</strong></p> <p>In September 2000, Katherine Kirk met an adviser from IFA Chase de Vere. He conducted a full financial assessment at her Southend home, then told her that her existing investment portfolio was suitable and no change was needed. </p> <p>So when a mailshot from Chase de Vere pushing a GE Life High Income and Growth Plan arrived in April 2001, she assumed it was a recommendation based on her previous dealings with the IFA firm. </p> <p>\"It said Chase de Vere was independent so I thought that meant they were acting for me, recommending products that were genuinely suitable for me. It was personalised - it was not like an advert,\" she says. </p> <p>When she realised the bond would lose nearly all her investment, she complained to GE Life and to Chase de Vere. Both rejected her, saying she bore sole responsibility for buying the bond. \"Even if you accept this, and I don't, these bonds should not have been allowed by regulators. </p> <p>\"The balance of risk is so skewed. If the market falls, you lose. If it rises, you do not gain. But you have to be a financial expert to work that out,\" she says. </p> <p>The ombudsman's adjudicator took seven closely typed pages to reject her complaint. \"How is anyone supposed to understand these fine points of financial law?\" she asks.</p>",

  "<p>If you want to get people angry at work, talk about management bonuses. This usually comes with the phrase 'fat cat' attached, just so there's no mistaking the pungency of the ill-feeling. </p> <p>Bonus payments remain one of the great \"them and us\" issues, with people at the top end of the pay scale outraging their workforce by appearing to be helping themselves to disproportionately large amounts of extra cash. </p> <p>On the other side of the fence, the senior managers who lay claim to these additional payments shrug their shoulders and argue that this was all part of the package that made them sign up and no more than the going rate for a tough job. If it's offered, who isn't going to take it? </p> <p>But is this a good way of handling rewards? If this is pay for performance, shouldn't the whole staff be sharing the benefits? And why should well-paid managers be given extra for doing their job? </p> <p>Bonuses can be highly divisive - and where there is already a troubled history of labour relations, it can sow the seeds for future disputes. </p> <p>Earlier this month, a \u00a3100,000 bonus for the chief executive of one of the London underground lines prompted threats from the rail unions that they would be seeking similar generosity when it came to their own pay negotiations. </p> <p>\"This won't be forgotten when it comes to putting in the next pay claim,\" warns a spokesperson for the RMT railway union, saying that tube workers were \"incredulous and angry\" at the scale of the bonus. </p> <p>\"It's our people who get their hands dirty and keep the system running,\" he says, accusing the tube bosses of helping themselves, while it was the considerably less well-paid staff who were actually helping the public. </p> <p>\"If there is extra money because a company is doing well, it should be shared by the people who have contributed, and it should be done in a way that is seen to be fair,\" says the spokesperson. </p> <p>Such payments can really raise the hackles - with the RMT saying that members are infuriated by a bonus which is several times the amount that frontline tube workers are expected to live on for a whole year. This is not the first time - and is unlikely to be the last - that bonuses are the subject of mutual incomprehension between managers and the managed. </p> <p>While performance pay is seen as a motivational tool, it also runs the risk of demotivating those who aren't on the receiving end. \"Organisations must take a reality check to see the impact of bonuses on the rest of the company, when staff down below are told to tighten their belts,\" says Charles Cotton, reward adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. </p> <p>And when top managers are living in the rarefied air of very high salaries, they need to look down to earth at what the rest of their staff are earning, rather than only glancing at the bonuses being collected by other rival senior executives. </p> <p>Another problem with the allocation of performance bonuses is that companies can be \"very hazy about what 'performance' means,\" he says. It also shouldn't be assumed that rewarding \"performance\" is inevitably going to produce desirable results. </p> <p>Stephen Bevan, research director at the Work Foundation thinktank, says that badly handled bonus payments can \"fuel a sense of injustice\" and become a \"PR disaster\". But he says that bonuses can be used more creatively and in a way that can increase a sense of common purpose rather than division. </p> <p>This can include \"team bonuses\", where groups of workers are rewarded collectively for achieving targets - and says that government departments are beginning to experiment with this. </p> <p>There can also be profit-share schemes in which there are extra payments explicitly linked to the success of a company, so that everyone can benefit. This also means that workers have to accept \"risk share\" as well as profit share, in which they will lose out if businesses are doing badly. </p> <p>But too many companies \"lack imagination\" when it comes to pay policy, he says. And what often happens is that lower ranking staff are told that their pay is set in relation to inflation - which means not much movement or flexibility - while senior managers are told that their pay has an added dimension of reward for performance. </p> <p>This basic split - carrot for the top earners, stick for the lower earners - builds in a sense of division, which he says will send a message to the majority of staff that they are not valued. </p> <p>Mr Bevan says that in researching attitudes towards pay, he has found a deep-seated reluctance from senior managers to be more creative about staff pay. </p> <p>\"Pay can be a powerful tool and lever for performance, but there is a lack of imagination. It's as though they have a fear of opening the floodgates, or that employees will somehow take advantage of them.\" </p> <p>Recent figures on boardroom pay suggests that there is no such reticence when executives are considering their own pay. Figures from Incomes Data Services showed bonuses had helped to give directors of FTSE 350 firms an inflation-busting 16.1% average annual pay rise - further widening the gap between the top and bottom of the pay scale. And will those extra payments carry on antagonising the rest of the staff? No bonuses for answering. </p> <p><strong>Incentives for staff - and employers</strong></p> <p>Workplace incentive schemes come in many guises; at their most seductive, bonuses are simply cash pay-outs on top of normal salary. </p> <p>Employers often move from one type of bonus scheme to another. Take traditional piecework, where a fixed price is paid for each unit of output. In a sense there is a bonus incentive - the more a worker does, the more they make. </p> <p>But work that once earned a bonus often gets incorporated into normal pay. So as soon as the workers begin to chalk up hefty bonuses, the employer will often shift the goal posts. </p> <p>Performance-related rewards have been around since the 80s, but have developed rapidly. Usually they are based on an assessment of an individual employee's or a team's performance against pre-set objectives. </p> <p>For example, the Royal Mail rewards workers who do not take any time off sick: they are entered in a draw for one of 34 Ford Focus cars or 68 prizes of holiday vouchers worth around \u00a32,000 each. This move was thrust upon the state-owned company, which suffers from chronic absenteeism. </p> <p>Staff bonuses are also good for the company coffers as a way of curbing payroll costs, because the additional cash payments are not consolidated into annual salaries. </p> <p>What's more, with low inflation, significant wage rises are expensive. But one-off lump sum bonuses provide good PR and are an effective incentive without building in automatic upward drift in future payroll costs.</p>",
  "<p>A year ago, Abbey National UK Growth was probably the most hated fund in Britain. Variously described as a \"dog fund\", a \"sinking supertanker\" and \"even worse than an endowment policy\", it languished at rock-bottom in the performance tables. </p> <p>But are there now signs of a turnaround? In recent months, the \u00a31.25bn fund - used by many Abbey National mortgage holders as a vehicle for paying off their home loans - has started to show some better figures. While encouraging, it is probably a case of one cheer rather than two - and certainly not three. </p> <p>The fund, launched in 1995, invests in a broad mix of big UK shares and was sold by Abbey as an alternative to endowments, enabling borrowers to build up a tidy nest-egg with which they could repay their mortgages. </p> <p>But by dripping money into the fund, mortgage holders were flushing their cash down the drain. At first, it wasn't too bad - in the first four years it managed average performance, and at one point grew to \u00a32bn in size. Then in 1999, it began a catastrophic decline. By October last year it was ranked 331st out of 332 funds in the UK equity sector. </p> <p>What went wrong? A slavish adherence to growth stocks such as telecoms, technology and media companies was largely to blame. Abbey hung on in when others baled out after the end of the dotcom boom, while a switch into more defensive stocks came too late. </p> <p>In October last year, Abbey finally pulled the plug on the fund manager running the trust. They parcelled the \u00a31.2bn that was left into three portions, giving State Street Global Advisors 50%, JP Morgan Fleming 25% and Barclays Global Advisors 25%. </p> <p>How have they got on? Well, over the year the fund is up 12.5%, a shade below the average for UK growth funds of 13%. But over six months it is up 3.5% compared with the average of 2.8%, and over three months is ahead 2.6% compared with the market's 1.5%. </p> <p>Abbey's John Kelly says: \"It's not one big event; rather a number of factors. The combination has worked well - when one has slowed, the other has come through.\" </p> <p>But financial advisers who specialise in investment funds are unimpressed. Phil Clements, investment director of Towry Law, says: \"This is classic marketing department stuff. The recent rebound in the market has been concentrated in a few shares at the top end of the index, where the Abbey National fund has always been focused. </p> <p>\"For example, it has always held a lot of BP, which has done well because of the rise in oil prices. It would have been extraordinary if this fund hadn't done well over the past few months.\" </p> <p>He says since the FT All Share came off its lows in March 2003, the Abbey fund is only up 29.5%, compared with 40% for the market as a whole and 70% for Invesco's UK Growth fund. He says growth investors would do better switching to funds such as HSBC Growth &amp; Income, and Lazard UK Alpha, while long-term investors might switch to Invesco Perpetual Income or Framlington Equity Income.</p>",
  "<p>Science and engineering degrees have traditionally been viewed as a less sexy option than choosing arts and humanities - well, in the UK at least. Yet graduates in these disciplines are the driving force behind some of the country's key industries - from pharmaceuticals and defence to energy and construction.</p> <p>Science and engineering graduates can look forward to some of the most creative, innovative careers on offer, so we asked employers attending next Thursday's Science, Engineering and Technology Fair (see below) at Manchester's G-Mex Centre what they're looking for:</p> <p><strong>How has the market for science and engineering graduates changed?</strong></p> <p>\"The number of jobs in science and engineering has fallen so graduates keen to continue developing in technical roles are discovering opportunities harder to find,\" says Mathew Westcott, graduate programme manager at BAE Systems.</p> <p>With more students graduating each year, plus EU expansion, competition for graduate trainee positions is intense, says Rachel David, senior graduate recruitment officer at Corus. \"The key is to focus on what you are looking for and target applications carefully.</p> <p>\"Certain graduates are still in short supply - electrical engineers and metallurgists being two particular areas. Upturns in manufacturing, construction and utilities sectors - in some cases tied to growth in China and the US - mean that exciting opportunities are available that enable students to put the technical, commercial and management theories learned at university into practice.\"</p> <p><strong>What are the skills, degrees, talents and aptitudes employers seek in science and engineering graduates?</strong></p> <p>As well as strong qualifications, British Nuclear Group (formerly known as BNFL) says it also looks for graduates who have a strong commercial focus. \"We look for graduates who are able to work as part of team, who are ambitious and want to develop themselves to become the best that they can be,\" says graduate recruitment manager Helen Newton.</p> <p>\"At Corus we look not only for good technical skills but also good interpersonal skills,\" says Rachel David. \"Whatever function graduates join us in, be it engineering, R&amp;D, commercial or any other area, they need to be innovative and creative, be able to sell their ideas to others, thrive on change as well as be enthusiastic, motivated and resilient.\"</p> <p>\"We also look for innovators and problem-solvers - those graduates who will bring new thinking into our business and will be confident enough to challenge the status quo,\" says BAE Systems' Matthew Westcott.</p> <p><strong>What can employers offer science and engineering graduates?</strong></p> <p>\"We realise that we are not only competing with other engineering or industrial firms to attract science and engineering graduates but also with investment banks, financial services and management consultancy firms,\" says Rachel David of Corus.</p> <p>\"Where possible we would like the graduates to stay in engineering and use the technical skills they have gained during their degree course. The onus is on us to show the broad range of opportunities that are available, the exciting projects we are involved in worldwide and highlight the fact that graduates can have the best of both worlds by combining on-site, hands-on work within a business context. We recognise that attaining chartership with the relevant institution is a high priority for graduates.\" This year Corus has launched a new five-year training and development programme. \"It provides key milestones but is also flexible enough to recognise and meet individual personal development requirements.\"</p> <p>At British Nuclear Group, graduates on the Elements development programme are paid a basic annual salary of between \u00a321,000 and \u00a322,000 plus a \u00a31,500 tax-free welcome bonus. They can also sign up for a final salary pension scheme - a rarity among employers these days.</p> <p>\"Graduates who join the scheme receive real life job experience from day one, along with structured development and support from all areas of the business,\" says Helen Newton.</p> <p><strong>What can science and engineering graduates do to give themselves the best chance of getting a job?</strong></p> <p>Know yourself and know the company is the advice of Rachel David at Corus. \"Begin by thinking about what things give you a buzz and that you enjoy doing now; then try and find a role and a company that can offer you some or all of those elements. Showing evidence of having done some research - knowledge about the company, its recent performance, current issues affecting the market it operates in, coupled with enthusiasm and motivation for the company and the role - is a good start.\"</p> <p>Check you meet the minimum criteria before making an application, advises Matthew Westcott of BAE Systems. \"Use the application form to sell your skills and abilities, academic and otherwise,\" he says. \"We sift candidates out of our recruitment process if they do not exhibit the competencies we are looking for, such as customer focus, working with others or technical ability.\"</p> <p>\"Perhaps the most important thing is to apply early,\" says Helen Newton. \"As many employers like us recruit into real vacancies, all applications are treated on a first come first served basis so pre-Christmas applications are strongly advised.\"</p> <p><strong>Fair progress</strong></p> <p>A wide range of private and public sector employers will be offering thousands of career opportunities next week at Manchester's G-Mex Centre - from graduate positions and work experience to placements and postgraduate study.</p> <p>The Finance, Business and Management Consultancy Fair on Wednesday, October 27 and the Science, Engineering and Technology Fair on Thursday, October 28 will showcase more than120 employers looking to recruit top talent.

  "<p>It might seem odd that a person who spent four years working in medical research would want to leave that and go to work for a museum, but for me it's been very freeing.</p> <p>As a museum-cum-science complex, At-Bristol aims to bring science, nature and art to life in its city waterside setting.</p> <p>Among others, there are various displays on how the body works, and my particular specialty, the brain, is very well represented. We now house the largest brain exhibition in Europe with around 70 exhibits explaining how the brain works.</p> <p>Visitors can see a series of brains starting with an unborn baby in the womb, right through to old age. There are also a series of interactive games to test your brainpower. Visitors can test themselves to see how good a witness they would be in a court case -there are lots of fun exhibits, as well as the more serious.</p> <p>My background was very much in academia. I spent four years doing a PhD at Cambridge specialising in treatment for those with spinal injuries. It was very laboratory-based work - I focused on the healing properties of scar tissue. At times I was working at the cutting edge of a very important bit of medical research.</p> <p>As part of the research I presented papers and gave talks. After a while I found that increasingly liked the idea of communicating science to a wider public. As soon as I found out that At-Bristol was being built I was intrigued by the project. A few months later I found myself chatting to the head of science and a year later I was interviewed and offered a job.</p> <p>I joined At-Bristol a year and a half before it opened which gave me a chance to be involved in the exhibits and since then we have been awarded more funding. My job sees me constantly thinking how we can change the exhibits to keep our regular visitors engaged.</p> <p>The thing I like about the role is the fact that it is ever changing and it is equally rewarding. I do occasionally miss the research, but the problem with postgrad study is that it is no guarantee of earning power. Even with a PhD, I started here on only \u00a313,000 - I'm earning much more than that now.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:miles.brignall@tiscali.fr\">miles.brignall@tiscali.fr</a></p>",
  "<p>If you have always wondered why some technological innovations just simply never take off, and you have a background in either computing or sociology, we may have a postgrad course that's right up your street. The Digital World Research Centre (DWRC) at the University of Surrey in Guildford, has just started offering a new inter-disciplinary postgrad course - a masters in digital technology that examines how it fits with its users.</p> <p>Under the umbrella of the DWRC, lecturers from both the sociology and computing departments have joined together to deliver the syllabus. According to DWRC's Lynne Hamill, it will provide students with the skills required for a range of jobs involving digital technologies in the IT industry.</p> <p>\"The course is designed to equip students with the social scientific resources to investigate the role of digital technologies in society, and the technical resources to contribute towards their ongoing development.\"</p> <p>She says the course is suitable for those who have either a first degree in a social science or a first degree in computer science, or the equivalent, and who have an ambition to make significant contributions to the development and use of digital technologies. The university wants those who have practical experience as well as those coming straight from a first degree.</p> <p>\"History is littered with examples of technological breakthroughs that were never adopted by the general public. One of the reasons is that lots of companies creating this stuff are packed full of engineers who don't have a sufficient understanding of how the technology will impact on the user. We aim to produce people that have the skills to help organisations make sure they don't make the same mistakes.</p> <p>Lynne says Microsoft software packages are a perfect case in point. \"Most of us use less than 10% of its functions - you have to ask why the other 90% is there? Our aim is to give people with technological backgrounds a chance to learn some softer skills, and those with the social skills a solid grounding in the technology.</p> <p>In the autumn and spring semesters, there is one central course: the design and use of digital technologies, in which students participate in small group projects, collaborative presentations and discussions. In the spring semester, students take one specialised elective. These modules are assessed by a mixture of essays, practical exercises and short examinations.</p> <p>Lynne says students will be encouraged to spend three weeks at Easter working on a placement in a range of organisations offering work in the field. Throughout the year, there will a series of visiting speakers from the mobile phone and other industries Lynne expects those on the full-time course to go into. Applications for the 12 or so places are considered from January for admission in late September and fees for home students are around \u00a33,000.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:miles.brignall@tiscal.fr\">mailto:miles.brignall@tiscal.fr</a></p>",
  "<p>Hollywood mansion? Renee, Nicole and Jude popping round for drinks? Groupies gathering on the lawn? You'll be lucky - there are thousands of young film-makers desperately trying to get their first break in the industry, with intense competition even to make the tea.</p> <p>Animation isn't any cosier. Wallace and Gromit might be snuggling up by the fire with a nice chunk of Wensleydale, but, in bedrooms across the country, computers are being fired up, plasticine prodded, and the latest batch of CVs stuffed into envelopes. </p> <p>But if you have the talent, it is possible to get the break.

The latest Big Jeff short will be screened at the Brief Encounters festival next month.</p> <p>\"I went to art college in Bristol and didn't really know anything about animation. It was just being in Aardman that convinced me that I would like to do it,\" Tom says. \"I made a short film, Big Jeff, in my bedroom in a couple of weeks and did all the voices myself. The moment I finished it, I saw an ad for DecpicT!, entered and came runner up in the competition.</p> <p>\"Now we're hoping to turn Big Jeff into a series as an Aardman project.

  "<p>Tracey Emin has made her bed and now she's got to lie in it: this seems to be the view of the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), which has insisted that the artist's debut film, Top Spot, must have an 18 certificate because it includes a single scene of teenage suicide. </p> <p>Tracey has complained - she sees the piece as a morality tale for young people - but her executive producer, Michael Winterbottom, must be even more confused; his own film, Nine Songs, was this week granted an 18 certificate although it consists almost entirely of unsimulated sex acts between a young couple. </p> <p>These coincidental rulings seem contradictory: Emin meeting the censors at their most draconian, Winterbottom benefiting from liberalism. But on examination, the two decisions suggest a coherent view of what should be viewed at what age. </p> <p>At its simplest, the certification system exists to protect a putative movie-goer from psychic damage or imitative behaviour: a five-year-old from having nightmares, a 12-year-old from being encouraged to get a gun or knife to settle scores. Beyond this, there has been a (broadly rightwing) social desire to prevent under-18s from witnessing certain sexual language or acts and a (broadly leftwing) wish to protect workers in the movie industry from exploitation. A combination of prurience and human sympathy has prevented the approval of hard-core pornography. </p> <p>Nine Songs represents a difficult test for censors because it qualifies as pornography in at least two ways: it is likely to cause arousal (and could be employed solely for this purpose) and - unusually in mainstream movies - the sex is not pretend. This reality is an issue because the BBFC had in the past seemed to distinguish between acting and action, the extreme case being \"snuff\" movies. But, with digital manipulation and verite techniques, it's increasingly hard to know if what's on screen is real, so the board seems to have conceded a reasonable enough distinction between actual sex and actual homicide. </p> <p>For me, what separates Nine Songs from porn is that the performers do not seem (from their accounts) to have been exploited, nor has their health been put at unreasonable risk. The BBFC seems also to have granted the film the distinction of being art - commending the \"context\" and narrative development - but this is a problematic precedent. Most porn films have some kind of plot - guy becomes only male teacher in convent school, bloke gets gigantic dick in transplant mix-up - and Winterbottom's set-up is notably perfunctory: boy meets girl. </p> <p>In fact, by restricting the film's content to alternating sex and songs, the director seemed to me to be deliberately refusing the excuse of context: he wished to make a movie about screwing and so dispensed with the elaborate narrative apparatus of the previously most explicit British movie: Intimacy, by Patrice Chereau. </p> <p>It's true that the emotional arc of Nine Songs goes beyond pornography: each encounter is subtly different, marking a stage between meeting and leaving. But the BBFC's judgment risks encouraging the prejudice that porn will pass as long as it's dressed up as art. </p> <p>A stronger justification for giving Nine Songs a mainstream release is that it easily passes the copycat test: the one really important reason for cinema certification. Because Nine Songs shows tender, mutually respectful, protected sex, only those opposed to contraception or non-marital sex could really complain if people of 18 and over were to copy the behaviour in the film. </p> <p>That judgment is crucial to understanding why Top Spot has also been granted an 18 certificate. Although the subject is sex, the material is never visually explicit and it certainly passes as an art film (if a movie by an artist isn't, then what is?), but it stumbles on the question of the behaviour of the characters being duplicated. The risk of a 15-year-old being moved to copy an artily depicted wrist-slitting might be small but the consequences would be far greater than if Nine Songs were to make a movie-goer of voting age feel horny. </p> <p>It's understandable that this feels unfair to Emin, especially as her film is firmly moralistic while Winterbottom's is morally neutral. But the censor's position is logical. Adults are being trusted to make up their own minds about sex; younger teenagers are being protected from the possible glamour of suicide. There are problems in film certification - such as an anachronistic attitude to swearing - but Emin's X certificate isn't one. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It was no surprise that two people in Fanelli's Bar and Grill were reading Philip Roth's new novel, The Plot Against America. Fanelli's is the left epicentre of Soho, a manufacturing district in lower Manhattan that became home to artists and galleries in the 1970s and now is filled with Euro-shoppers. Tourists avoid Fanelli's - grimy, badly lit, air-conditioned down almost to absolute zero - leaving in peace the elderly union organisers, greying sculptors and the odd younger family feeding enormous Italian meatballs to children in prams. </p> <p>Roth's novel, a fantasy of fascism overwhelming America at the beginning of the second world war, is a story that people in my local worry might become fact. In Roth's novel, the charming, empty-headed airman Charles Lindbergh comes to power in 1940, manipulated by a vicious vice-president. The outside world frightened Americans; domestic purges of Jewish-Communist-terrorists reassured them. The novel has a pedigree; in the 1930s Nathaniel West wrote A Cool Million and Sinclair Lewis It Can't Happen Here , both horror stories of Americans embracing right-wing despots out of innocence and fear. Like his ancestors, Roth is far too gifted to write a piece of crude agit-prop. He relies on the news to make the modern connections for him. </p> <p>My first day back from London, labouring over a Fanelli cheeseburger cooked to the consistency of leather, the television was tuned to a discussion of the Patriot Act. </p> <p>In its first version, passed shortly after the terrorist destruction of the World Trade Centre in 2001, the act gave the government new surveillance powers (called \"data mining\") over individual citizens, while cloaking the government's own operations in greater secrecy. Patriot Act II, a draft of which was first leaked in February 2003, proposed to go much further. For instance, US citizens could be stripped of their citizenship if the government believed they belonged to a terrorist organisation; this would be purely an administrative decision, as would be the deportation of non-nationals who threaten America's \"national defence, foreign policy, or economic interests\", in the words of the draft. </p> <p>In the bar, people watched in stunned silence a dispassionate, juridical discussion of these proposals on the tube, occasionally glancing through the dirty windows to the crowd surging outside, who seemed somewhere else, far away. The scene in the bar sums up my strongest impression, in the weeks since I've returned, of the American intelligentsia - an honourable word here. Bushism has made intellectuals afraid of their own country. </p> <p>Four blocks from Fanelli's, the cartoonist Art Spiegelman presented his new book In the Shadow of No Towers a few weeks ago at the Cooper Union, New York's version of Toynbee Hall. At first no establishment publisher would touch this story in pictures of how Spiegelman's family lived through the attack of September 11 and its aftermath; he was too \"political\" in asserting the bombing had been high-jacked by politicians. At Cooper Union, the street-smart, chain-smoking Spiegelman reliably provoked laughter as he jibed at President George W Bush, silence when he compared the scenes in his new book with those of Maus, his comic-strip novel about Nazis. Had he gone too far? Spiegelman kept going. He turned the knife by remarking that the only Americans who were not afraid now were the New Yorkers who lived through the attack. The knife twist reminded me of a question put to me last Christmas by a British soldier: how long would Americans have endured the Blitz? </p> <p>\"Fascism\" is both a strong and an opaque word. Discussions here about whether America is threatened by fascism have been focused this autumn by the appearance of Robert Paxton's The Anatomy of Fascism. An historian of Vichy France at Columbia University, Paxton calmly explores rather than rants about fascism as \"democracy gone wrong\" in Europe from 1919 to 1939. Yet its final chapter has roused debate because Paxton argues that democracy can go wrong whenever far-right beliefs intersect with conservative economic and political institutions, and that the longing for an iron grip is much more than historical accident. Light references to Israel and the United States evince Paxton's prudence yet his readers have not taken these suggestions lightly. </p> <p>We could think of fascism itself as either hard or soft. Hard fascism rams home to the citizen that he or she is held in that iron grip, as in Mussolini's theatre of force or George Orwell's nightmare Nineteen Eighty-four. Soft fascism is not so much a velvet glove as an invisible hand, the operations of control hidden from scrutiny as Patriot Act II, and more, internal repression presented to the public as merely preventive action against threats that have yet to materialise. The Bush administration acted in this preventive way, for instance, by shutting three of the larger Muslim charities in America, not for anything they had done, but for what might happen, some time, somewhere. In hard fascism the state exploits concrete fear, in soft fascism the state exploits diffuse anxiety. </p> <p>\"Security\" takes on a peculiar meaning in soft fascism. Perhaps the most disturbing book to appear this year, Jeffrey Rosen's The Naked Crowd, illuminates the twisted experience of security. In Rosen's view, reality TV and its like have made invasion of privacy into popular entertainment. The pleasure of stripping away privacy fits into an economy where high-tech firms such as Oracle make large profits from developing personal data bases, listening devices, and auditing software for business. Government destruction of private rights thus become \"naturalised\": the public already enjoys the act of stripping people naked, and this intrusion is just an extension of how business gets done in the computer age. </p> <p>Diffuse anxieties only add further fuel to this \"naturalised\" process. Insecurity about what might happen, some time, somewhere, becomes an ongoing state of mind; it co-habits with preventive measures, but these draconian measures do not erase unease. Indeed, as the state machine acts stealthily to prevent things happening, as its technologies become built into the fabric of everyday business practice, there can be no defining moment when an ordinary citizen could declare, \"now I am more secure\". </p> <p>Is America menaced by soft fascism, as many intellectuals fear? As the autumn has progressed, the iron grip of Bushism has loosened, due to the regime's practical failures abroad. To his credit, Senator John Kerry has recognised something more is at stake; though chastised by the left as weak, the language he speaks aims to be reassuring. Even if Bush is voted out, though, the half of the nation for which he speaks will not lose its anxiety. The answer to my question lies in the domestic circumstances of America for which terrorism has become a talisman of unease at home. </p> <p>It's become a journalistic cliche to divide America into red and blue states. The red states: southern and western, Republican, godly, abortion, gay and feminist unfriendly, militaristic. The blue states: eastern or coastal, Democratic, secular, identity-friendly, diplomatic. The country thus appears divided exactly in half. What these clich\u00e9s don't get at is something red and blue share, America's confused, fear-inducing experience of class. </p> <p>In a book that has come into its own this autumn, What's the Matter with Kansas?, Thomas Frank ponders how poor people in that heartland state, threatened with loss of work, lack of health insurance, or mounting family debt, address these woes. Preventing abortion or gay marriage seems some sort of solution; economics gets translated into culture. Like the retired union organisers in Fanelli's who yearn for the working-class politics of New York in the years after the Great Depression, Frank invokes \"false consciousness\" to explain what's happening now. </p> <p>Translating economic into cultural insecurity is nothing new. Nearly 40 years ago, when we researched The Hidden Injuries of Class , Jonathan Cobb and I found white workers in Boston blaming drop-out hippies and black ghetto culture for their own, unrelated labour and communal problems. And as an ideal, the cultural conservatism of the working classes idea stretches back into the 19th century and across the ocean, as in Disraeli's famous image of \"angels in marble\", the working classes whose everyday solidity awaits the sculpting hand of conservative leadership. </p> <p>What is new is the class map. Ironically, the British conservative Ferdinand Mount has drawn it in his new book, Mind the Gap. In the last generation, large numbers of people have come to feel excluded from the \"skills society\" or \"meritocracy\" of Blair's Britain and Clinton's America. These are people whose beliefs in self-discipline, hard work and family sacrifice do not yield much control over their own lives. As Mount points out, they feel left out and treated by the more agile with - at best - indifference. At Spiegelman's talk, he got a good laugh by saying he didn't know anybody in the American heartland. </p> <p>Loss of control is an economic fact, but a subtle one. More than in Britain, the wealth of America's middle classes has stagnated as the upper 10th has dramatically improved. To counter this stagnation, the middle class has taken on consumer debt it can barely manage, as Robert Manning has recently documented in Credit Card Nation. People have tried to spend their way into status, and now the bills are coming due, as personal bankruptcies have taken off. </p> <p>The same loss of control appears, famously, in the shrinking number of jobs. The familiar villain is outsourcing of work to Mexico, China or India, but the familiar villain misleads. Auto-mation has finally arrived in America, shrinking white-collar service jobs and manufacturing alike. In the past 20 years, for instance, the US steel industry increased its productivity by four per cent while cutting its labour force from about 212,000 to 79,000 - a transformation due mostly to automation. Again, young people now leaving university find themselves offered jobs that formerly went to secondary-school graduates. As in Britain, low-wage immigrants in America flourish in the cracks of the formal economy, but their children and grandchildren increasingly do not. </p> <p>Is it \"false consciousness\" to counter these changes by prohibiting abortion or gay marriage? Translating economics into culture is both irrational and logical. In the wealthiest country on Earth, the economic engine rouses Ricardo's ancient spectre of uselessness; the class map is shrinking the number of people who matter, who are included. The new class map breeds fear, and the counter to fear is to assert that the old values matter. By shifting the centre of gravity, you assert your own value when confronted with conditions you can do nothing about. </p> <p>How this translation works is exemplified by perhaps the most controversial book to appear in America this season, Samuel Huntington's Who are We? He is well known to Brits for his previous book, The Clash of Civilizations , which argued an inevitable global conflict between Islam and the west; this new book minia turises the same argument within America. Now Mexicans appear as local Muslims, an alien, unmelting presence refusing to play by American rules. The book is less remarkable for its ethnic prejudices than for its invocation of \"traditional\" American values, wrapped up in a Protestant non-conformist, small-town, package; Huntington proudly asserts he is \"anti-cosmopolitan\", world-travelled Harvard professor that he is. Though most Mexican immigrants happen to live in abject poverty, that is not the point; he is \"defending America\". </p> <p>This is indeed an apology for soft fascism. Fearful of the present, the outside, the alien, the defender of America looks backward to a mythical golden age in Puritan New England. But now the white anglo-saxon Protestant is armoured with a computer. The culture of soft fascism cannot be reduced to the traditional bogeymen of the American left: even in its liberal years, the United States was an ardently religious country; Americans were ardent nationalists even when they fought for Europe in the two world wars. Nor is the appeal of soft fascism to be treated with simple contempt. The terror attack tripped a domestic switch about experiences of marginality that people have trouble naming and about which they can do little. Abroad, Bushism registers a wounded national honour; at home, confusion about living honourably. </p> <p>In the years I've lived in London, I've often been asked why American intellectuals were so slow to respond to the threats of soft fascism. In a way this criticism is unfair; while the New York Times temporarily lost its nerve, the New York Review of Books didn't. It's certainly true that individuals like Susan Sontag were attacked for being disloyal for saying things about American imperialism that are commonplace in London. (She also didn't lose her nerve.) And until this year - and perhaps too late - policy-makers and thinkers in the Democratic party were on the defensive. </p> <p>A kind of archaic residue from the McCarthy era is one explanation. Though most 20th-century wars were fought under Democratic presidents, liberals have had to prove their patriotism as conservatives have not. But the denizens of my local - myself included - provide more of an answer. </p> <p>For a long time the American intellectual left has been out of touch with the American people. It has spoken in the name of the people but not to them. Now, in the reconfigured landscape of economics, class and culture, however, the educated, cosmopolitan liberal is a social victor. Even the sculptor in Fanelli's struggling to make ends meet is a social victor; nobody can rob him of his work and worth. </p> <p>The right has perhaps understood that victory better than the victors themselves, in giving fresh life to the taunts of \"cultural elitism\" aimed at the intellectual left. The attack embodies a classic dilemma: when a young man with a good degree and an expensive lap-top attacks injustice, the ordinary person feels patronised. </p> <p>For the past four years, the rich and powerful in America have capitalised on just this social distance, between the cultural elite and people beset by anxieties about personal insufficiency and mutual respect. The victors have defended themselves by saying, but we are just like you, loyal Americans; the defence rings false because they aren't domestically the same. Those bewildered glances out of Fanelli's window, the knowing sniggers at Cooper Union, are signs of an inequality as ambiguous as the word \"American\". </p> <p>The books I've touched on evoke what could happen as a result of the anxieties besetting the country now, their exploitation on the right, and indifference, bewilderment, or paternalism on the left. The solution to soft fascism may, however, lie far beyond party politics. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Richard Sennett teaches sociology at the London School of Economics.

  "<p>There is an image of Jonny Wilkinson hanging high on hoardings that seems to say so much about Wilkinson and Englishness. It is an advert for Hackett clothes - blazers, shirts, ties, very formal, very smart. Wilkinson is appealing to a specific type of person. He looks successful, regimented, invincible, and stuffed with certainties. It fulfils a stereotype of the classic English Man, the rugger bugger. </p> <p>And, at first sight, Wilkinson is the classic rugger bugger. Actually, he is more than that - he's rugby union's real-life Boy's Own hero. He won his first England cap when he was 18 (the youngest player to represent the country since the first world war), he broke the points-scoring record set by his mentor, Rob Andrew, when he was just 21, he became the world's best fly half (a team's play-maker) and he scored more points than any other player in the 2003 World Cup finals. What makes him unique, apart from the phenomenal scoring, is that he is also a great defender who loves to tackle. It is this that makes him so susceptible to injury and is why so many experts believe that the Jonny Wilkinson who returns to the England side as captain next month will not be the same player. To top it off, he scored the supreme drop goal that won the final in the last seconds of extra time in Australia, against Australia. He was still only 24. There were two dominant sporting images in 2003 - Wilkinson cupping his hands, as if in prayer, before scoring yet another penalty goal, and Wilkinson kicking the winning points from his hands. Of course, he won sports personality of the year. </p> <p>Things could only go downhill from there. And they did. Rapidly. He suffered a shoulder injury that kept him out of the game for almost a year and could well have cost him his career. He had an operation that stood a tiny chance of leaving him permanently paralysed. Meanwhile, in his absence, there were ructions in the England rugby team - players retired, inspirational coach Clive Woodward announced he was quitting to pursue a career in the more lucrative sphere of football, and the shambolic world champions lost game after game. </p> <p>But, as you'd expect of Wilkinson, he has fought back. Now sporting a neat post-operative scar down the back of his neck like a number 1, he is again playing rugby for his club team, the Newcastle Falcons. There has been widespread criticism of his form, and the Cassandras of the rugby world are already forecasting that he will never be the player he once was. Yet he has not only been recalled to the England team, he has been made captain. </p> <p>At the Falcons ground there are painters and decorators galore, drilling workmen, club secretaries and a press officer, but no sign of Wilkinson. Despite the hefty investment by football magnate Sir John Hall, and despite Wilkinson's presence, the Falcons are still an unfashionable club in a city where football reigns supreme. Rugby fans often wonder what Wilkinson is doing in Newcastle, rather than living it up with top clubs such as Leicester or Sale. </p> <p>The club press officer asks what we are doing here. We explain that we are waiting for Wilkinson. Well, he'll leave us to it, he says indifferently. \"If it's been organised by his agent, I'm not running around looking for players.\" Wilkinson doesn't get the prima donna treatment at Newcastle. The secretary tells us that he is out training with the lads - extra training, I presume, after the club's recent poor run. </p> <p>Wilkinson eventually walks in, apologising as he takes off his boots - size eights. He wears them as tight as possible to boost his phenomenally accurate kicking. He throws his bag on the floor, his car keys to the side, and changes his trainers. He is wearing a T-shirt and jogging pants. He looks different from the clothes adverts - scruffier, less formal, warmer. </p> <p>I ask him what he had for breakfast. \"Why d'you ask?\" he grins. Because I want to know how many eggs you had? \"Eight this morning.\" Eight? \"Yeah, eight. Only egg whites. We take the yolks out.\" What's all that about, the yolks are the best bit? \"Yeah, but unfortunately they're the unhealthy part. It's the same with all food, isn't it? The bit that makes it fantastic is the bit that's bad for you.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson, aged 25, is famously obsessive about his diet and his training. He practises his kicking at least six days a week for up to eight hours. He completes each session with six kicks at goal from different positions, and won't stop until he has scored every one in the sequence - it once took him five hours. \"I can't rest until I have tamed the devil in my head,\" he says. He trains to the point at which \"my body is screaming at me and I feel like I'm going to be sick\". At times, Rob Andrew, the Newcastle Falcons director of rugby, has had to hide the balls from him. In the evening he comes home and eats up to 13 fillets of chicken. He refuses to go into a fast-food outlet even to use the toilet. </p> <p>I ask him what's his first memory of rugby. \"Being three years old and having a tiny green jacket and wellington boots on the side of the rugby field with my dad passing a little orange plastic ball around. My brother Mark was playing, he was four, and I was on the sidelines, just running up and down, chucking this little ball around. At the age of four I got pretty much into it.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson grew up in Surrey. His family took sport seriously. Does he think the competitive thing came from his mother or father? \"Both. My mum played squash for the county. My dad was a very good cricketer, a lovely player. He's got incredible pride. He's very motivated.\" As kids, didn't you and Mark ever think you were just a bit over-competitive, a tiny bit odd? No, he says, they were too busy competing to think about stuff like that. \"We just couldn't do it without actually giving it everything. We used to hate swimming, but we'd be in the swimming tournaments at school and it would be like, 'I really hate this, I wish we weren't doing this', then, as soon as you dive in the water, it's just, like, go for broke.\" </p> <p>He and Mark, 17 months older, decided from a young age that it was unhealthy to compete against each other. Was Wilkinson as competitive about, say, geography? \"No, I wasn't academically motivated.\" But even as he's saying it, he's having a rethink. \"I hated geography and history, but I couldn't bear getting bad marks.\" He left his private school with A-levels in biology, chemistry and French - an A and two Bs - and was preparing to read sports in the community at Durham University. But his games master from school, Steve Bates, moved to the north-east to coach Newcastle rugby team, asked him if he fancied turning professional, and that was it. </p> <p>Alongside the competitiveness existed an equally intense nervousness. As a boy, he was often sick in the car when his father took him to matches. If he lost or played badly, he became morose and impossible to comfort. \"From the earliest time I can remember, I've been a very nervous individual - not nervous because of being scared, not physically scared, just frightened of letting myself down or letting other people down or just losing. It just causes that kind of anxiety.\" It's all of a piece; the nerves are umbilically linked to the desire to do well and his pride in performance. </p> <p>There are certain words, such as \"pride\" and \"humble\", that Wilkinson returns to time and again. \"It's very much a pride thing,\" he says about his nerves. \"I know what it's like to lose and be disappointed, and the feeling for me is so intensely bad that I just don't want to go through it, and it's all mixed into one with wanting to achieve things and be successful. You chuck it all on one day, one opportunity, and it just causes that kind of anxiety.\" </p> <p>He seems so different from the Hackett Jacket man in the adverts - yes, certain in his goals, but in so many ways uncertain in himself. He is sheepish about his obsessions, but open and eloquent about them. Wilkinson talks quietly, with a diffident, melancholy streak. He smiles a lot - mainly when addressing his many weird habits. He's just written an autobiography, My World. It's one of those books designed for people who don't like reading - lots of handsome pictures and few words. Even so, he describes movingly his fear, the way he can be half-paralysed with fear. </p> <p>I tell him it made me want to hug him and that he may be the world's best, but surely it can't be worth all this pain? He smiles. \"It's a bit of a 'I can't live with it and can't live without it' thing. Every week you go through those feelings, you get through one weekend and you know the next one is just around the corner, but at the same time, when I was injured, it was the thing I missed the most. Getting through those periods and succeeding in those times are what I'm sure I will remember clearest and longest. To be honest, I'm more worried about what I'm going to do when I do give it up, to find a substitute for that kind of buzz - to go out and know that everything is on the line.\" </p> <p>He tells me about a Peanuts cartoon he used to have on his wall where Charlie Brown walks around saying he is really worried because he has nothing to worry about. The strange thing is that, on the pitch, Wilkinson is known for his unflappability, his karma. Even his approach to penalty kicks is based on the yoga technique of centring, channelling all his inner energy from a core point behind his navel. He doesn't quite know how or why, but he says somehow his hands just evolved into that prayer position. </p> <p>In many ways he lives the life of an ascetic. But the sacrifices he's made have mostly been easy, he says - egg yolks, for example. \"The things I wonder about more are the things I never did, not the things I gave up. University, for example. I wonder now whether I would have a bigger circle of friends that I could maybe look towards when times get very intense; if I could go to people that are not involved in rugby and don't think of me as rugby, if I could have experienced more things.\" Mark (6ft 3in, 17 stone and known as Sparks to his friends) went to university, then worked at a leisure centre before turning professional. Wilkinson (5ft 10in, barrel-chested and 14 stone) is sure his brother benefited from having a wider circle and having lived a bit. </p> <p>Does he think he would have done all the laddish things young men do if he'd gone to university? \"Erm, no,\" he says with a grin. Wilkinson has been going out with his girlfriend, Diana Stewart, for two years. She works for Sky Sports and lives in London. </p> <p>It's strange he's found himself a hero of this sport. Most of the anecdotes in his book feature colleagues flashing their willies or pulling down their trousers (not him, of course - he refuses to be photographed without his shirt on). \"Yeah, right! Tell me about it!\" he giggles. So I do: I have a theory - it's useful for him to have the excuse of looking after his body, because being blokey and getting pissed and flashing his willy would be unbearable for him. \"Yeah, right!\" he says again. \"Well, God, I haven't been for a night out for coming up to a year and a half now. I haven't drunk for a year and a half. It's not something I miss because it's not something I perceive as important to my life. My life is about being healthy and getting the most out of the opportunities I've been given.\" </p> <p>He can be fabulously puritanical (about alcohol, about wasters who fail to fulfil their potential, about players who allow themselves to be photographed topless), but more than a desire to impose his own values, it is, perhaps, a means of masking his own shyness. I can't help thinking of the bus journey through the crowds in London after the World Cup victory - whereas the others drank in the atmosphere and had a thoroughly good time, Wilkinson shrank into the background, crippled with shyness. </p> <p>Did it stop him enjoying it? \"Yeah, it's just not ... \" He trails off, and starts again. \"I did enjoy it. Deep down I really enjoyed it.\" But he didn't look as if he did. Soon after returning home, he said that he couldn't cope with the attention he was receiving; that while he was grateful for the support, it was making him \"uptight, angry and depressed\". </p> <p>True heroes, he says, are world leaders such as Nelson Mandela, or legendary sportsmen such as American footballer Walter Payton or basketball player Michael Jordan. But don't you see that is just how your fans regard you? \"No,\" he says, and he develops a semi-stutter. \"What I do is, I cannot, I cannot understand it enough and therefore it's confusing to me and I feel like a bit of a fraud.\" </p> <p>He says it's unfair that he gets the bulk of the attention. Take Mark, for instance - his brother is in the Newcastle squad but is not a first-team regular - \"I look at someone like my brother, who works as hard as he does with the rugby here, but also does more unselfish things. My brother does his kicking day in, day out, and because of the way I am, I'll be be out there for another hour and a half and he'll just stand by the post, catch balls and kick them back to me. He doesn't say a word; he doesn't say, 'Oh, for Christ's sake, I'm bored stiff here, can we go?' He just stands there and does it until I'm happy, and you think, nobody comes up to him and says thanks for that.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson talks of Mark with such love, I wonder whether it has been hard for both of them that he is much the better player. For the only time, he shakes his head and disagrees sharply. But you have been more successful, haven't you? \"I'd probably say better known and more fortunate. But I go out and train and watch him kick the ball 30 yards further than me time and time again, and I think he's pretty special. I like to work at myself to try to make sure I have every ability, but it doesn't mean that I can be as naturally gifted as him in the way he kicks a ball as far as he does or the way he passes.\" </p> <p>He and Mark share a house outside Newcastle in the Northumbrian countryside. His parents followed from Surrey and now his father, a former financial adviser, acts as his manager. Wilkinson says one of the most important goals left for him to achieve is to help Mark realise his potential as a player. \"It's more a case of paying back. He helps me every day, so unfortunately his support and my family's support and my friends' support have put me at a level, not a level, a place, where with international commitments, I don't actually have very much time left, but I want to make sure that, the time I do have left, I pay it back as much as I can to make sure he goes to the level he wants to. Otherwise, you finish with a lot of take from me and not a lot of give. I don't want him to sacrifice his opportunities for me.\" </p> <p>Is there anything he'd swap with his brother? Oh yes, he says, with relish, he would love his social ease, his ability to relax and put things in perspective. In a way, Wilkinson says, he is more relaxed with strangers these days, addressing a large audience - something Mark would run a million miles from. \"Yet in terms of being able to be around people he knows and be funny and tell jokes and mess around, he's a lot better than me. If we're in a group, I'm likely to be fairly quiet.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson isn't a religious man, but he could easily be mistaken for one. He likes to imagine he lives his life in front of a 24-hour camera (ironic, considering his desire for privacy) and that at the end of each day he can rest assured he's not let anyone down. \"It's a kind of religion, a set of standards that you live by. And it's having the pride not to drop below them, regardless of what outside pressures creep in. To say this is the way I am, this is the way I want to be, and to try to stand strong through whatever else happens. There are certain vows you make and you stick to them.\" </p> <p>Is that a moral code? \"Yeah, I think so, yeah. It's a moral code and a professional code. In sport it's professional, in life it's moral. It is about how you treat people. Like when I'm on the way to a game and I know I can't sign things, so I say to them, 'Look, I'll be around after the game, and I'll do as many then' - that to me is a way of doing it. And you don't say that and then sneak out of the back door.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson has to go off to a team meeting. He says he'll be back in half an hour, but he takes longer. To pass the time, I sneak a look at some papers he's left on the table - speeches for various kids' charities he supports. He's a bit terse when he returns. They've not dropped you, have they, I say. \"Not that I know of.\" He smiles. </p> <p>I ask if he was hard as a kid. No, he says, he never fought - he found that kind of thing intimidating. He was simply very sporty. But surely you need to be aggressive to play rugby? He nods. \"You have to lose a bit of yourself. You can't expect to come out of games completely unhurt. You need to have a sort of reckless side where you can throw yourself into a situation.\" </p> <p>He looks remarkably unscarred for a man who has spent his life belting and being belted. He's never broken his nose. There's a scar on his head, the post-operative zip on his neck, he's had loads on his lips and eyes, and his ears have been ripped and stitched five or six times. Are you allowed to scream \"ouch\" on the pitch, or is that regarded as unseemly? No, he says, it's fine to, \"so long as it's not a cowering ouch!\" </p> <p>After the World Cup, everyone wanted Wilkinson's endorsement. He turned down everything he didn't actively like; even so, it's hard to get away from one image or another of Jonny Wilkinson. Does he think he is in danger of invading his own privacy? Yes, he concedes, he has worried about it, but ultimately he doesn't seek out or use the paparazzi, so he thinks it's fair that they respect his desire to be left alone. </p> <p>A poll recently voted him the most shaggable man in Britain, I mention. He doesn't know where to look. He really is flustered. When he finally manages to get his words out, he says, \"You see that automatically causes feelings of repulsion in me.\" And he does look as if he could be sick. \"I just can't stand the idea of it. Ugh ! Mad, absolutely mad.\" Look, I say, enjoy it. But he can't. He's not insulted, he just can't imagine it. \"If people knew ... what people see of me, I compare with the fact that I spend Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday leaving home, going to the club, training, kicking balls, going to the gym, maybe pop to the cinema, maybe pop out for a meal, eating loads of food, sitting at home relaxing, then one day a week suddenly you're thrust into that environment where you're playing that sport in front of thousands of people.\" In short, he seems to be arguing, he's too dull to be a sex symbol. </p> <p>After the World Cup, he feared his world would never turn normally again. Being stopped constantly by supporters left him grateful, but anxious and depressed. He also thinks the media have changed in their attitude to him - sports commentators, he says, are less sympathetic. \"I've always maintained that my expectations of my own performance will be way, way higher than anybody else's, but people's expectations are so high now. Your game is going to be pulled apart, regardless of how everyone else plays.\" He's right. The critics have been merciless. I listened to a panel of experts on telly saying he wasn't good enough for England any more. \"Exactly, that's where everything has changed.\" They said you're not as fearless as you were ... \"That is just rubbish.\" </p> <p>Did he hear that himself? \"No, that is why I don't watch these things - all that is important to me is making sure I am accountable to my close friends and my family and my team-mates and the coaches.\" He pauses. \"It's not a brilliant feeling to understand that people are saying this,\" he says quietly. </p> <p>Both the injury and the comeback have forced him to reassess his career. After seven years of professional rugby and the World Cup triumph, he thought he'd seen it all, but now he says he's faced with different and difficult challenges every day - and new fears, of course. He says he can't wait to captain England, and reminisces that since childhood both he and Mark have loved to lead. </p> <p>Is he a shouter on the pitch? \"Yeah, definitely. That's what the will to win is.\" You sound so different when you're playing? \"I am a different person. It's like a split personality. Throughout the week I have one side of me that does all the preparation and resting and eating well and training, then it hands all that over to the second individual, and that other individual is a hugely competitive, instinctive one who is just desperate to win. He is a bit of a monster, actually.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson puts his rugby boots back on. He's off for another training session. On the way out we talk about obsessions. His latest is playing his guitar. He started playing in the hope of finding a hobby, a distraction, and now it's already another obsession. </p> <p>Does he think all great sportsmen are obsessive? \"I think you have to be. Being healthily obsessive is not a bad thing. I used to be scared of saying to people I am obsessive, but I am not now because that's the way it is for me - it's an obsession.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> My World, by Jonny Wilkinson, is published by Headline at \u00a320.

  "<p>For nearly 15 years I wrote hundreds of letters that weren't from me. They ranged from perfunctory thank-you notes and expressions of condolence, to extensive correspondence with the great and the good: politicians, newspaper editors, bishops, members of the House of Lords. The procedure I followed with a more intimate letter was to type it up, double-spaced in large font, and print it out. My employer - the sender of the letter - would then copy it painstakingly on to embossed notepaper using a Mont Blanc pen and blotting paper, signing it with a flourish at the bottom. </p> <p>Aside from the correspondence, I wrote a great many newspaper articles, speeches, the occasional poem, and several books. The books generated many reviews and profiles of the man whose name appeared on the cover. A number of literati entered into correspondence with the \"author\", unaware that the replies also came from a hired hand. We make a great team, the author often said. And we did. </p> <p>Ghost-writing is not new. It might almost qualify as the oldest profession if prostitution had not laid prior claim. And there is more than a random connection between the two: they both operate in rather murky worlds, a fee is agreed in advance and given \"for services rendered\", and those who admit to being involved, either as client or service-provider, can expect negative reactions - anything from mild shock and disapproval to outright revulsion. A professor at my old university, a distinguished classicist with feminist leanings, was appalled when she heard what I did for a living and pronounced me \"no better than a common whore\". This - the whiff of whoredom - is perhaps the main reason why people opt for absolute discretion. </p> <p>Over the years I learned a great deal about vanity, the desire to belong, the lengths a man will go to in pretending to be something other than he is. And the lengths a woman will go to in colluding with the pretence. </p> <p>I had never met anyone so strange and flamboyant - like a rare and tropical bird. His plumage was a wonder to behold; when he flapped his wings the lining of his jacket dazzled and glinted like a prism. He wore a large sapphire in his lapel, a vivid silk tie, one pink sock, one green. There were two gold watches on his right wrist and a platinum one on his left, and on his fingers a collection of jewels - rubies, emeralds, diamonds. </p> <p>\"You are going to enjoy working for me. I have a good feeling about it,\" he said. \"My motto is when we work, we work, and when we play, we play. That way everybody is happy, isn't it?\" </p> <p>His office was a spacious penthouse overlooking the heart of Soho. The first thing I noticed were the pictures on the walls - an assortment of naked or semi-naked women and several large cats clawing their way out of gilt-edged frames. But the centrepiece, mounted on the wall behind the leather-topped desk, was not a painting at all: it was a huge tiger skin complete with head. Apart from the fact that it was dead, it seemed very alive, its bold orange and black stripes setting the wall ablaze. </p> <p>\"I identify with the tiger,\" he said, without a hint of abashment. \"The tiger eats everything, but nothing eats him. He will even eat a crocodile if he wants to! He is King of the Mountain, King of the Forest, King of the World.\" He drew himself up, regally, in his chair. The tiger's head was just above the talking head, its eyes shining brightly, curiously round and manlike. For just a second, in that little corner where fantasy and reality collide, the two heads merged and became one. </p> <p>\"What would you like me to call you?\" I asked as we shook hands on parting. </p> <p>\"You can call me what you like,\" he said. \"I shall call you Beloved - all the girls who work for me are Beloved - but you can call me whatever you want.\" </p> <p>\"In that case,\" I said, \"I shall call you Tiger.\" </p> <p>\"I like it,\" he said, and kissed my hand. </p> <p>Arriving in Tiger's publishing house for the first time was like turning up in someone else's dream. It seemed a very long way down the rabbit hole. It felt high-voltage and slightly dangerous. There were abnormally high levels of emotion - lots of spirited laughter, shrieking and embracing. The atmosphere seemed to teeter on the edge of hysteria, and it was hard to work out the sounds. Were they angry, or were they just loud? I suppose I had the mistaken idea that only clever, serious people worked with books, and that they probably operated in a quiet, meticulous and, well, bookish manner. I had pictured earnest men of letters, old-fashioned gentlemen, slightly tweedy and with pale skin that was seldom exposed to natural light. </p> <p>In fact, the building sizzled with youthful vigour, in the shape of stunning, sophisticated young women. They had patrician accents, exceptional poise and uncommonly long legs. Their skin was not pale but healthy and bronzed. And there wasn't a man in sight. Here in this office, in 1981, women ruled. Yet there were no bluestockings, only silk stockings. The offices covered four floors, with staircases slightly aslant and walls off-centre. The furnishings were quite shabby and a layer of black London dust rested on the surfaces. Everywhere there were piles of books and high-rise manuscripts. And, curiously for a publishing house, there were clothes suspended in doorways and draped from light fittings, as if the premises might actually be shared with a dressmaker. Boas and belts hung on the backs of chairs, and on several doors there were coat-hangers bearing evening gowns and stylish jackets. In the loo I found underwear, tights and nail varnish. </p> <p>Tiger had a conglomerate of companies connected with publishing, fashion, films and theatre. He had been dubbed \"a cultural tycoon\" by the Times and he lived up to this dubbing assiduously. The ethos in the empire was not one of profit and loss, but of name and fame. Like its proprietor, the publishing house was sui generis, and it had a reputation quite disproportionate to its size. It was known to be radical and risk-taking. Tiger took chances with books and seemed to act mostly on impulse. He would meet people at parties and sign them on the spot. Sudden ideas were converted into improbable publishing ventures, and books were invented that ought never to have existed. He acted speedily and never flinched from taking a decision. He loved controversy, courted it indeed, and any whiff of scandal merely strengthened his resolve to publish. \"Let them sue! Let them sue!\" he would say, rubbing his hands together. \"But I am a fighter, and I fight to win!\" Tiger basked in this image, and we basked in it too. By association, we felt as if we were also fighters, that we too would win, and although at editorial meetings there was hardly ever a discernible rational plan, the atmosphere was highly charged and there was a lot of heady talk about noble ideals. </p> <p>\"Do you like my girls?\" Tiger asked not long after I had started my new job. \"They are amazing, isn't it?\" His girls were scarcely ever out of the gossip columns and they always knew somebody who knew somebody. Their most important work, as Tiger himself affirmed, was done out of office hours - at dinner parties, first nights, charity events, gallery openings, fashion shoots and hunt balls - for they ensured that news of his latest exploits was trawled through London's most fashionable hotspots. The smart outfits hanging from the office doors began to make sense. I was introduced to Cosima, Selina, Lucinda, Davina, Samantha and two Sophias. There seemed to be a conspicuous homogeneity of Christian names. Surely there ought to be a collective noun for this phenomenon, I thought, this concentration of cognates. An assonance perhaps? An artillery? I then met Andrea (a Baroness) and Sabrina (an heiress), and in due course, Alethea, Nigella, Eliza, Candida, Mariella, Zelfa, Georgia, Henrietta and Arabella. It was a lot to take in, the sort of list I would have been made to learn by rote at school, like books of the Bible or irregular Latin verbs. </p> <p>It was clear that I did not belong in this world. I was looked upon, with some justification, as one of Tiger's whims; I lived in Scotland, worked largely from home, and turned up in London only for editorial meetings, staying for just a few days at any one time. I didn't know anyone. Not even anyone who knew anyone. At home in Scotland, there were two small children and a baby, the centre of my universe. But in the London office I never mentioned the fact that I was a mother. I was at pains to fit in, and I sensed that talk about children would not be wise. I therefore pretended to be someone else, someone I was not. </p> <p>My initial work as a translator fed into this pretence. To be any good as a translator you have to do a kind of disappearing act. As the years passed, I moved sideways and took another sort of invisible presence, one that also tried to catch the voice of the author and be a conduit for his creation. I became Tiger's ghost. </p> <p>Our partnership produced lots of newspaper articles, interviews with well-known figures and several non-fiction books. But although they brought Tiger a sense of fulfilment, there was no lasting contentment. Eventually he became convinced that the way ahead for us lay in a different sort of publication. The real test was the novel. </p> <p>\"We need to evolve,\" he said. </p> <p>I did not demur. </p> <p>It is 1994 and we are in Tiger's house in France. Tiger believes that France is the best place in the world to create a work of art. \"We will have everything we need - the best food, the finest wine, a high-tech music system, a studio to work in, the fresh Dordogne air.\" </p> <p>How to write a novel? How to write someone else's novel? These two questions seem absolutely central. \"What sort of novel are we thinking about?\" I ask. </p> <p>\"We are thinking about a beautiful novel, very beautiful,\" he says, and he looks somewhere into the middle distance, smiling rapturously, already transported by the sheer imagined beauty of it. \"And it will have a beautiful cover. We will make sure of that.\" He taps out the last six words on the table. </p> <p>\"But what genre are we talking about? Are we thinking of a romantic novel? A thriller?\" </p> <p>(These conversations are always conducted in the first person plural.) </p> <p>\"It will be thrilling, oh yes. And also romantic. Very romantic. </p> <p>\"Oh, yes.\" </p> <p>\"So, a love story then?\" </p> <p>\"But of course! It has to be a love story. People associate me with love. I am famous for love.\" </p> <p>\"What sort of love story do we have in mind?\" I ask, as if we are discussing wallpaper or home furnishings and he has to pick one from a limited range. \"Is the love requited or unrequited?\" </p> <p>\"Definitely requited. Oh yes, very requited.\" </p> <p>\"And who are the characters?\" </p> <p>Even by our standards this is becoming an odd exchange. </p> <p>\"Sweetie,\" he says, his tone long-suffering as if humouring an imbecile. \"It has to be the love between a man and a woman. Do you think I could write about poofters? No, it has to be a man and a woman - a beautiful woman and very sexy. There will be lots of sex, but very distinguished. We will do the sex beautifully. Isn't it?\" </p> <p>\"And do we have a storyline? Do we have any idea of what it is about?\" </p> <p>\"Of course, Beloved! I have thought of everything.\" He squeals the last word in a spasm of exuberance. \"Let me tell you the idea. It is very simple. There is a man ... he is like me somewhat ... he is married ... he falls in love with a woman ... there is a huge passion and then well, we will see what happens after that, isn't it?\" </p> <p>How to proceed? Write what you know, they always say. But what did I know? Suddenly I knew nothing. In a bid to avert panic I decided to make a list of things in my favour. The list was not long but it was a start: </p> <p>1. I have written a lot already (just not a novel). </p> <p>2. I have read lots of novels. </p> <p>For the first of these to count as an advantage you have to believe that all writing comes from the same place. I'm not sure that I do believe that. Writing prose is not writing fiction. The most I could hope for was that the experience of writing journalism, literary pieces, book reviews, and so on would act as some sort of training ground for writing a novel. As for reading a lot, there is, sadly, no causal connection between the fact of having read fiction and the ability to write fiction. I know this at an instinctive level, and I think perhaps I have always known it, but this did not prevent me gathering together dozens of novels and taking them to France in my suitcase. I did this partly in the hope of discovering how to write a novel, and partly because I thought the systematic approach might compensate for lack of inspiration. The next two days were spent dipping into books by Penelope Fitzgerald, Anne Tyler, Carol Shields, Beryl Bainbridge, Alison Lurie, Anne Fine, Jennifer Johnston. At the end of the second day I realised that I had been reading only women writers, surely a foolish exercise if I was to learn to write like a man. For the next two days, fighting off a slight feeling of frenzy, I read William Trevor, John Updike, Ian McEwan, Tim Parks, John Banville. </p> <p>What I discovered was that when time changes are handled well, you scarcely notice them; as a reader, you are perfectly happy to move through days and weeks and years, in either direction, provided your author has a safe pair of hands. The devices are subtle - the judicious use of a pluperfect tense, for instance, or the foreshortening of a character's history. The same applies to point of view: the narrator - even when the story is told in the first person - has various tricks up his sleeve to allow the reader to know what the other characters are thinking and feeling. And the handling of dialogue was a revelation. Critics are fond of saying, \"The dialogue doesn't work,\" but when it works well, it is, paradoxically, a kind of dialogue that people believe is spoken, or feel comfortable with, not what actually is spoken, which would not work at all. Often the very best dialogue is not in the least authentic. </p> <p>Who was to be \"our hero\", and the woman with whom he was to fall in love? The man, according to Tiger, was married, so perhaps his wife would also play a part in the story? Which made a total of three. From one or two remarks Tiger had made, I had a hunch that he already identified with the main character in the book. Confirmation came from an unexpected source, an interview with Tiger that appeared in the Scotsman newspaper around that time. </p> <p>\"... His whole demeanour suggests passion constrained. He cannot sit still for long. He talks quickly, almost imploringly, and the words tumble over each other ... From now on he is going to be a novelist. This is what is fresh. This is what is now. 'It is not going to be a beeg novel ... It will be more a philosophical and a literary book. It's about my love of women and what would happen - what the consequences would be of such a love if ... well, anyway, it's about a man who loves two women.'\" </p> <p>\"My love of women.\" There, I knew it. A dead giveaway. If it was a slip, it was surely a telling slip. There was now little doubt in my mind that Tiger saw himself as the protagonist. In some ways this simplified things - at least there was an abundance of source material to work on. But I soon realised that the fictional version of Tiger would have to be based on his own self-image. He could not be, like the most interesting characters in fiction, seriously flawed. No, our hero would have to be sensitive, compassionate, successful in business, of strong moral fibre, devout, impassioned and wise. He would probably also be something of a self-styled philosopher and he would have to have a great capacity for love. And so, to work. I sketched out a plan in which the main character would be a wealthy businessman whose ordered life would be turned upside-down by an extramarital affair. This would arrive like a bolt from the blue and would coincide with a crisis in his life - the death of his beloved mother. I tried this out on Tiger. He pulled a face. Something wasn't right. It wasn't immediately clear what it was. </p> <p>\"Darleeng, PLEEEase, do we have to have the death?\" He spoke imploringly, drawing out each word. </p> <p>\"You don't like the death?\" </p> <p>\"I don't like the death.\" </p> <p>\"Well,\" I said, caught a little off-guard, \"I do think we need to have some sort of crisis, and a funeral is always quite a good focal point in a novel.\" Then, gaining in confidence, \"Also, the emotional upheaval associated with bereavement would be a neat way of allowing the affair to take place. It would make it more understandable in a way.\" Now the coup de grace: \"I mean, we don't want to make him an uncaring bastard who cheats on his wife, do we?\" </p> <p>The mention of an uncaring bastard would surely be enough to win him round, but instead he pulled another face. I wasn't sure what was bothering him. He stroked his lower jaw and made a prolonged moaning noise. Eventually he said, \"It's no good. We have to find another crisis. You see, my mother is still alive and, well, I don't want to upset her.\" </p> <p>Gently but firmly, I suggested that it was important that the life of the main character was not matched in every single aspect with his own, indeed, it was essential that it wasn't; that the proposed book should be, in essence, a work of imagination; that it would be a pity if the critics dismissed it simply as a replica of his own life rather than a serious literary endeavour; and that it could quite properly reflect his own concerns while at the same time retaining its own artistic integrity. After which, he agreed - albeit somewhat ungraciously - to the death of his mother. </p> <p>For the next week or so, I tried to free up the flow by telling myself that it was just another job that had to be done, that none of this mattered, that I was free to write anything that came into my head. But the fact that I was writing with a mask on bedevilled the whole process. </p> <p>I decided to call the main character Carlo and make him a successful advertising executive living in London. The novel would begin with Carlo's return to his native Italy to attend his mother's funeral. The reason for giving him dual nationality was twofold: it fitted very generally with Tiger's own background, and it would act as a metaphor for further conflict and dichotomy. The trip to Italy was surely a stroke of genius: it would allow for our hero's journey in all senses - physical, mental, spiritual and emotional. It would also enable the affair to take place in the hot and steamy Mediterranean climate and, finally, it would conveniently provide the backdrop of Catholicism - Tiger's professed faith - which would in turn introduce the familiar tensions between faith and reason and passion. I warmed to my theme. </p> <p>I tried to think myself into what I imagined Tiger's style might be, but the more I searched for his voice, the more I caught my own breaking through; the more I tried to realise his literary aspirations, the more my own seemed to intrude. The novel did not grow organically; it was force-fed and boosted with steroids. Set pieces and ruminations on the human condition were thrown about like salt. It became a stilted, studied thing. I was consumed by doubt. The characters were not \"real\"; they were mouthpieces for various ideas, which shoved them around and kicked them to the ground. Andr\u00e9 Gide said something to the effect that the true novelist listens to his characters and watches how they behave, whereas the bad novelist simply constructs them and controls them. Without a doubt, I was constructing and controlling. </p> <p>Almost the one thing I didn't mind was that it was to be a love story. After all, what else is there? It's only half a life without love. And a novel would be surely nothing without it. The prospect of writing about love was even faintly appealing. It is one of those eternal themes that can be endlessly reworked. But every silver lining has a cloud; as I had feared it might, love was coming perilously close to denoting sex. </p> <p>Tiger was obsessively concerned with its place in the novel. Each day when I returned from the studio he would ask, \"Have we done the fucky-fucky yet?\" I counselled against it, as anyone in my place would have done, suggesting that discretion was the better part of ardour. But he pooh-poohed and said that a novel by him would be unimaginable without sex. </p> <p>\"Beloved, we need the jig-jig! Don't you see?\" </p> <p>He laughed and clapped his hands, willing me to share his enthusiasm. But I didn't see. I held out for a long time, pointing out that countless authors had believed they could \"do\" sex in a novel and had ended up falling into a terrible black hole. I reminded him of the Literary Review's Bad Sex Prize, awarded annually by Auberon Waugh, a friend of Tiger's and a man who had made it his mission to discourage the tasteless and perfunctory use of sexual description in the modern novel. Surely he agreed with Bron? I argued that sex in the novel was nearly always bad sex, and that it was best avoided. \"You are talking like a nun!\" he said. \"What's got into you? Trust me, Beloved, we will do the sex beautifully! It will be very distinguished.\" </p> <p>The literary treatment of sex is beset with vexed questions. First there is the problem of getting the characters to take their clothes off - buttons and zips and hooks can be so awkward, and you couldn't ever allow a man to keep his socks on. Then there are the body parts, which either have to be named (very unwise) or else replaced with dubious symbolism. And what about the verbs, the doing words? How can you choose to make people enter, writhe, thrash, smoulder, grind, merge, thrust - and still hope to salvage a smidgen of self-respect? The sound effects are even worse: squealing, screaming, the shriek of coitus. No, the English language does not lend itself to realistic descriptions of sex. We are too used to irony. What to do? What to do? Then, a sudden flash of brilliance, and I knew what to do. Tiger had an abhorrence of bodily fluids. His hatred of people who coughed or sniffed or spluttered was legendary. Provided that the sex scenes could be made sufficiently liquid, he might decide to abandon them altogether. Nil desperandum. Bodily fluids would be my deliverance. I set about my purpose with a devil-may-care recklessness. </p> <p>\"Strong and gentle as the waves, he swells and moves towards her like the sea to the shore. He dips and dives, eagerly but hesitantly, still fearing rebuff, until that moment of absolute clarification, when her ardour too is confirmed beyond doubt. Her lissom limbs quiver and enfold him into the sticky deliciousness of her sex.\" </p> <p>Of course, one thing led to another, and it was hard not to get carried away. Tiger, far from feeling squeamish, seemed relieved that at last the lovers had got down to the business. I pressed on, telling myself it was a means to an end. He would soon change his mind. Every new splash or splosh was a fresh hell. But still Tiger held out. There was no capitulation. In fact he was exultant. He opened a bottle of Chteau Margaux and we drank to sex. \"Bravo!\" he said - his highest accolade. This wasn't working out as planned. I would try one more act of sabotage. I had to make certain this time. Go for broke: </p> <p>\"They play with each other like wet seal pups, their bodies making succulent, slipping sounds. With his tongue he caresses her and spins a silver spider's web from the threads of her wetness. The pathway to heaven pouts like the calyx of a flower turned to the sun, the inner petals drenched in nectar. Her beautiful mound rises and falls as she rubs herself against his chin. </p> <p>\"As she trembles and gasps and comes, he feels a surge of happiness and an infusion, of supreme power. Her juices trickle down like a cluster of stars from the firmament. He can do anything now. He is God in one of his incarnations, spreading love and joy. Her amber thighs rear on either side like the waters parted for Moses. He rises and enters her.\" </p> <p>At least four things happened as a result of all this incontinence. Tiger was overjoyed; he raised my salary; the Sunday Times described the novel as \"a strong contender\" for the Literary Review's Bad Sex Prize; and my teenaged children were mortified. The novel was launched in the spring of 1995. It was a glittering occasion with all the usual suspects, beautiful creatures plucked from London's fashionable set. Tiger had a well-deserved reputation for throwing the best parties in town. Lots of glamour and glitz and permanent tans. People asked if I knew Tiger and if I had read his novel. On the whole, the critics were kind; there was scarcely any venom, and derision was reserved for the sex scenes. According to the TLS reviewer, \"It is only in these scenes that the author comes close to losing control of his spare, precise prose.\" The Sunday Telegraph reviewer wrote, \"I prefer to forget those brief, explicit embarrassments,\" while another review was entitled simply: \"Less sex please.\" </p> <p>This is an edited extract from Ghosting: A Memoir, by Jennie Erdal published by Canongate price \u00a314.99.</p>",
  "<p>On Wednesday, April 24 1895, after Oscar Wilde's arrest three weeks earlier, an auction was held at his Tite Street home. In prison, awaiting trial and facing bankruptcy, he had no choice but to submit to the dismantling of the House Beautiful. </p> <p>Up for sale with his books and furniture and - poignantly - his children's toys, was the blue and white china which, he had quipped at Oxford, he had such difficulty living up to. The frivolity of that comment had inspired, presumably to Wilde's delight, a moralistic sermon in the University Church. Nearly 20 years on, his provocative behaviour had succeeded in making him more notorious than his undergraduate self could ever have envisaged. </p> <p>Like so much else in Wilde's life, the sale of his household effects, forced by his creditors, was a spectacle. People who had no intention of buying anything crowded into the chaotic rooms just to nose around. The inevitable thefts took place; some items were simply scattered all over the floor; and the sale failed to raise sufficient money to pay off Wilde's debts, which amounted to about \u00a33,600. </p> <p>Next week, a copy of the original catalogue for the Tite Street sale will be auctioned at Sotheby's and is expected to fetch between \u00a330,000 and \u00a340,000. The ignominy Wilde faced in 1895 has been replaced by reverence, and his reputation - bound up, it has to be said, with his life more than his works - has reached a new zenith. As an icon, he has been given the honour of a memorial window in a Westminster Abbey; sculptures of him have been erected in Merrion Square in Dublin and in central London; in the 1997 biopic, Stephen Fry played him as a sentimental hero, with Jude Law as an uncanny Bosie lookalike. For some, he is a gay martyr, for others, a symbol of Irish Nationalist resistance; others still prefer to cast him as a highbrow philosopher in the Nietzschean mode. Last week, a new musical of his life story opened at the Shaw Theatre in Euston, London, written and directed by the former Radio 1 DJ Mike Read. </p> <p>Such proliferation of versions of Wilde is nothing new. He was, of course, a man who calculatedly made it his business to become famous, effortfully attaching himself at the start of his career to the already famous, such as Sarah Bernhardt, as a means to this end. His image began replicating itself through culture even before he left Oxford, and from the start he seems to have impressed on others a persona more fictional than real. In 1877, he spent a university vacation travelling in Italy, where a brief encounter with a novelist, Julia Constance Fletcher, yielded an instant portrait of him as the languid poet \"Claude Davenant\" in her book Mirage . He would subsequently appear in the fiction of countless other writers. His ex-friend Andr\u00e9 Raffalovich turned him into poet \"Cyprian Broome\" in The Willing Exile after they fell out (the rift occurring when the rich Russian invited Wilde to dinner and overheard him saying to the butler when he arrived with some cronies, \"I'll have a table for six, please\"). In our own generation, we have, among others, Peter Ackroyd's extraordinary act of ventriloquism, The Last Testament of Oscar Wilde . </p> <p>In addition to the fictional Wildes there are also, of course, the competing versions of the factual one provided by his biographers. His career coincided with - and was subsequently helped by - the rise of mass journalism, and in his own lifetime he was the subject of numerous profiles and interviews, actively participating in the construction of his public image (the Biograph magazine, for example, was fed the snobbish lie that he had been privately tutored at home rather than attending the unglamorous Portora Royal School in Enniskillen). </p> <p>After his death, memoirs of Wilde's life and personality by his own acquaintances began to appear, with friends jostling to prove their closeness to the man whose pariah status inspired their protective tendencies. According to Wilde's grandson, the scholar Merlin Holland, these \"public squabbles about the 'truth' of his life... assumed all the elements of a sort of boulevard theatre\". Nevertheless, these friends usually provided sympathetic accounts at a time when Wilde's name remained almost unspeakable in polite company (in the 20s, the young Mitford sisters would try to shock and embarrass adults by asking what it was that the criminal Oscar had actually done). The one exception was Lord Alfred Douglas. </p> <p>Following Wilde's death, Bosie had been married (briefly) and converted to Catholicism. He had also developed a bitter hatred for his erstwhile lover's memory, plus a paranoid addiction to conspiracy theories worthy of his infamous father, the Marquess of Queensbury. Included in the Sotheby's sale is a copy of his tirade, The Wilde Myth , a text so rare, there are only two extant copies in the world. Typeset in 1916 but never published - it libelled the home secretary Herbert Asquith - this extraordinary rant describes Wilde as \"one of the most powerful forces for evil that has happened in Europe for the last three hundred years\", and warns the young not be be taken in by his wicked illusions. \"I do not know of any man,\" Douglas goes on, \"who more truly and literally sold himself to the devil than he did.\" </p> <p>Douglas's diatribe certainly tells us more about him than it does about Wilde, and tends to corroborate the emotional truth of Wilde's post-prison autobiography, De Profundis , from which the young aristocrat emerges as an unstable and destructive personality. Yet despite a century of posthumous biographical activity - including Richard Ellmann's magisterial though not unflawed 1987 account, and Neil McKenna's recent investigation into his subject's gay sex life - the personality of Wilde himself seems as hard to pin down as ever. Instead of trying to imprison him in a definitive box, perhaps we should try, in the words of Merlin Holland, to \"accept that our view of Wilde must always be a multicoloured kaleidoscope of apparent contradictions in need not of resolution but of appreciation\".</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Divine Comedy, by Dante (13hrs 50mins, Naxos, \u00a349.99 CD)</strong> </p> <p>Considering its towering place in western literature, few people have actually read Dante's Divine Comedy. They may quote its most famous line - \"abandon hope all ye who enter here\", written above the entrance to Hell - but that's about it. So why would anyone bother to read an incredibly long medieval Italian classic with frankly not much plot and far fewer interesting characters than Pilgrim's Progress, Paradise Lost or similar morality narratives? Because it is important and because on audio it is infinitely more digestible than in print. </p> <p>As usual, Naxos has put together a quality package containing everything the novice classical scholar needs to get the most from his subject, including a comprehensive crib explaining the more arcane references to Greek mythology and medieval popes, a short biography of the author and moody music to introduce each canto. Of the three books - L'Inferno, Il Purgatorio and Il Paradiso - the first, as you'd expect given that the Devil has all the best tunes, is the most entertaining. Tarantino fans will relish the lengthy descriptions of sinners being slowly roasted upside down or hurled into the ravine of tears, a ghastly reservoir of boiling tar tended by devils with pitchforks. I'm not sure about Benedict Flynn's translation. Did Dante really have one of the damned raising his hands, cocking two V-signs and shouting \"up yours God - so much for you\"? Purgatory seems uncannily like Philip Pullman's Spirit World, and Paradise is frankly OTT with radiance and rapture, but Heathcote Williams's enthusiastic reading keeps you going if only because you reckon that if he can do it, so can you. </p> <p><strong> Homer's Odyssey (3hrs, BBC, \u00a315.95 CD)</strong> </p> <p>This dramatisation of Homer's heroic epic does not need a crib. It opens with the Olympian equivalent of a coffee morning where the gods conveniently fill you in on past events, present circs and what might constitute the best tactics for returning Odysseus, king of Ithaca, to his faithful if beleaguered wife Penelope, who last saw him 20 years earlier when he set out to lay siege to Troy. No one does heroic epics better than the Beeb. The only trouble with distinguished actors is that their voices are so familiar that it's hard to suspend one's disbelief. Mary Wimbush is a terrific Eurycleia, but to me she will always be Elizabeth Pargetter's appalling mother-in-law in The Archers.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Lucrezia Borgia: Life, Love and Death in Renaissance Italy</strong> <br>by Sarah Bradford <br>368pp, Penguin, \u00a325 </p> <p>It says something about the reputation of the Borgia family that when, one hot day in 1503, two of them went down with violent nausea, everyone immediately assumed that they had somehow managed to poison one another by mistake. In fact, on this occasion it looks as though Pope Alexander VI and his son Cesare may simply have been the victim of some bad seafood or a nasty bout of malaria, but the point was that, as far as the talking, writing, worrying classes of Renaissance Italy were concerned, the Borgias were a byword for the dark arts of realpolitik. </p> <p>No one's reputation has been damaged more by belonging to this first family of pantomime evil than Lucrezia Borgia, daughter of Pope Alexander and sister of Cesare. Her casual reputation has been that of a murderous vamp who had only to sleep with someone before slipping something nasty into their post-coital wine. She was whispered to have had non-fraternal relations with her brother, which was the cause, 300 years later, of Lord Byron developing a perverse crush on her (he, too, was hazy about how far you could go with your own flesh and blood). Byron's thrill-seeking - he stole some of Lucrezia's golden hairs from a locket she had sent to her lover - was part of the 19th century's more general desire to turn Lucrezia into the embodiment of every kind of female transgression. By the time Victor Hugo and Donizetti had finished with her, Lucrezia Borgia could barely stand for the burden of evil that was slung around her fiendishly beautiful shoulders. </p> <p>Sarah Bradford's job, then, is to dust down Lucrezia and help us to see her for what she really was - a young woman (she died at 39) who was trying to play the best game she could with the uneven hand she had been dealt. The first dud card, of course, was the business of being born a girl, which meant that from the age of 13 she was being handed round like a parcel to suit her father's political game. Divorced at 17, remarried and widowed soon after (Cesare, her brother, stepped in to strangle the second husband), Lucrezia was 20 when she took up the job that was to be the making of her. As the wife of Alfonso d'Este, heir to the Duke of Ferrara, she became an accomplished stateswoman, deftly running a green and golden wedge of Adriatic Italy during her husband's many absences. </p> <p>Bradford's problem is that of all biographers working in the early modern period: the stories may be there, but the characters aren't. Personal letters, which to us are carriers of private thought and feeling, were to the Borgias public documents, to be dictated to scribes. Contemporary chron iclers, meanwhile, were interested in the what and where of the story rather than the why. Even those witnesses who wrote apparently for their own eyes, such as the diarist Johannes Burchard, the Pope's master of ceremonies, seem to have thought in terms of spectacular set pieces rather than deep structure. His account of the \"Chestnut Orgy\" in the Vatican - where naked courtesans scrabbled for chestnuts and prizes were offered to the man who could have sex with the most women - has probably done more to blacken Lucrezia's reputation than any other event. But did Lucrezia laugh at these ghastly sights, did she squirm, or turn away, or was she at the party simply for the dancing, which she loved? None of these Burchard sees fit to tell us, so neither, alas, can Bradford. </p> <p>In many places these public narratives deliver delicious detail, which Bradford makes the most of. One of Lucrezia's main duties as a Renaissance princess was to cut a bella figura wherever she went, sending a loud message about her menfolk's worth and status. Getting dressed was both a competitive sport and a political act, and the chroniclers linger with disbelieving pleasure over Lucrezia's cloak of crimson satin lined with ermine, or her sleeves of cloth of gold which hung to the floor. Even her mule would not appear in public without a wide cloth of mulberry velvet and a harness of beaten gold. </p> <p>The political background to Bradford's book is a cat's cradle of intrigue and quickly shifting alliances that requires you to keep your historical wits about you at all times. Whether the end result - the conclusion that Lucrezia was quite nice really - is sufficiently new or startling to justify keeping faith with nearly 400 dense pages of plotting is unclear. The problem does not lie in Bradford's treatment or research, which is immaculate, but is part of the larger problem of how to deal with biographical subjects who lived at a time when to be a sentient human being meant something very different from what it does today. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Kathryn Hughes is writing a biography of Mrs Beeton.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain Vol II 1649-1815</strong> <br>by NAM Rodger <br>907pp, Allen Lane, \u00a330 </p> <p><strong> The British Seaborne Empire</strong> <br>by Jeremy Black <br>420pp, Yale, \u00a325</p> <p>When we can eat Australian blueberries in the depths of winter, courtesy of air cargo, ships may seem redundant to some except for pleasure, their history an irrelevance. But we will always be an island, and 90 per cent of all our trade still comes and goes across the almost three-quarters of the Earth's surface that consists of salt water. This is a compelling reason for the study of naval history, as long as it has been written not to glorify the past, but simply to explain a great deal of it and its consequences. </p> <p>Long the preserve of imperial historians such as William Laird Clowes and Julian S Corbett, a change in attitude to the subject can be detected from the moment the Society for Nautical Research was founded in 1910, with its dispassionately international approach. Ever since, through many long and increasingly unfashionable decades, British naval history has been in the hands of more detached (if not totally disinterested) scholars, of whom NAM Rodger is now by far the most exciting and original. The first part of his monumental naval history appeared in 1997 and a publisher's blurb has never been more amply justified: here at last is the \"long-awaited\" second volume. </p> <p>Its predecessor began with the Dark Ages and finished with the execution of Charles I, and now Rodger takes the story on to the end of Napoleon's time, 10 years after Trafalgar. His approach is the same as before, based upon his conviction that our naval history has been \"a national endeavour, involving many, and in some ways all, aspects of government and society\", presented by him as such and not simply as an account of warfare at sea and the Royal Navy's preparations for it. Almost half of The Command of the Ocean , in fact, consists of background to events involving British men o'war, so as to place these in the widest possible context. Rodger thus dwells at length on the inherent problems of naval victualling, not simply to point out that the navy was the biggest purchaser of foodstuffs in the 18th-century London markets, but to demonstrate that its requirements actually encouraged and led to a commercial and agricultural revolution, \"which made the British economy the most sophisticated in the world\". </p> <p>As before, his scholarship is formidably eclectic, typified by a table of sea battles and the various names by which they were known in different countries, which is \"offered as a modest contribution to the reduction of confusion\". It helps that he can evidently read the sources in several languages, which has enabled him to explore the intricacies of Dutch politics to explain the Anglo-Dutch wars of the 17th century. Here is that rarest of all historians, the expert with the generalist's approach to his speciality, though his academic instinct is sharp enough for him to criticise colleagues who in his view have got things seriously wrong. </p> <p>There is wit here, as well as illumination. It's recalled that Sir Cloudesley Shovell, the much-loved admiral who was lost when three of his ships foundered on the Scilly Isles in 1707, had once said: \"There is no storm as bad as one from the House of Commons.\" One of the themes running through the book is the constant tension between the politicians and the sailors, never greater than after the glorious revolution of 1689, when Parliament was packed with congenital landlubbers whose constant sniping reduced naval morale so much that some officers subsequently lost their nerve under fire. Rodger comes very close to claiming later that the American colonies were lost because the navy was not used more sensibly by the politicians in the events leading up to 1776. </p> <p>Anyone with a military background or sympathies viewed the navy with suspicion, and it was eventually true that in popular esteem the sailors became \"an expression of the liberty of the people, where the army was an expression of the power of the crown\". </p> <p>Yet it was the fleet that had brought Charles II home from exile in triumph - having first carefully replaced all its republican emblems with the royal insignia in mid-Channel - and it was Charles II who reinvigorated a navy that had first prospered and then declined during the Commonwealth, when one ship's company went without pay for four years. Far from being the lazy cynic of popular reputation, Charles attended meetings of the Navy Board more regularly than any official and he had a passion for the sea, which he enjoyed as the first patron of yacht-racing. He and his brother James II, in Rodger's view, understood naval technicalities better than any other sovereign \"before or since\". George III's knowledge was probably limited to what he learned from his son William, who was put into the navy in 1779, after which \"his vast repertoire of dirty stories made him the terror of every genteel drawing room\". </p> <p>Other characters in an enormous cast are neatly sketched: the Dutch admiral Cornelis Tromp, a brave but nasty piece of work who tried to have his mild-mannered superior De Ruyter murdered; Samuel Pepys, linch-pin of the Navy Board, who profoundly disliked the gentlemen officers then being challenged by the \"tarpaulins\", the men with less breeding but much more maritime know-how; Lord St Vincent, the martinet who was on his quarter-deck before dawn each day to check up on the captains in his squadron who did not turn-to at first light; vice-admiral Collingwood, who burst into tears when his ship was decommissioned, which meant dispersing his crew; William Bligh and Fletcher Christian, the one an outstanding seaman with a bad temper, the other \"a weak and unstable young man who could not stand being shouted at\". </p> <p>Horatio Nelson gets his due, as a commander who succeeded brilliantly because he secured the affection of his men, even though he was not by any means the greatest seaman around. Rodger summarises the gunnery at Trafalgar in some detail but, because he does not deal in clich\u00e9s, we are spared yet another account of the death scene aboard Victory. Instead, it is pointed out that women sailed in English men o'war of the period quite frequently, and that a child was born aboard HMS Goliath during the Battle of the Nile. </p> <p>Rodger does not cut corners either, so this is his second long book, made more so by a wealth of highly instructive appendices. He gives us interrelated naval, political, social, administrative, diplomatic, economic and religious history of a very high order, and anyone who reads it will hope we don't have to wait another seven years for the completion of the trilogy. </p> <p>Jeremy Black has also approached his subject with wide terms of reference, his basic premise being that \"Sea power made the empire what it was: without sea power there would have been no empire... in the form it actually took.\" This may seem self-evident to some, but as Black, too, occupies a chair in history, he is doubtless more aware of widespread ignorance than those of us of who were the last children of the British empire. He logs both the acquisition and the decline, noting the effect of both on the rulers and the ruled, and there are many intriguing glimpses of the evolution of the Pax Britannica (it was in 1831, for instance, that atlases first began to show British possessions in red, though foreign cartographers preferred different colour schemes). The naval element is carefully tracked, but this is essentially one for those who are puzzled by the concept or nostalgic for the experience of empire. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Geoffrey Moorhouse's book on Henry VIII's navy will be published by Weidenfeld next year.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Blood &amp; Roses: The Paston Family in the Fifteenth Century</strong><br> by Helen Castor<br> 347pp, Faber, \u00a320 <br> </p> <p>In 1735, a parson named Francis Blomefield was called to a tumbledown house at Oxnead in Norfolk to pass judgment on some old papers that had belonged to William Paston, the late Earl of Yarmouth. He found a heap of family letters, many going back to the Wars of the Roses three centuries earlier, and, as he wrote to the late Earl's executors, \"of good consequence in history\". </p> <p>The letters, published by John Fenn of East Dereham in 1787, were a literary sensation. \"I did not know there was so much as a private letter extant of that very turbulent period,\" wrote Horace Walpole. In more than 1,000 documents covering more than 70 years, as Fenn put it, \"the family life of individuals is laid open\". Though not the only English family papers from the time, nor even the oldest, they are by far the most circumstantial. With patience and insight, which the Cambridge scholar Helen Castor possesses in superabundance, the Paston letters can be made to tell a family story of depth and subtlety. </p> <p>Of the founder of the Paston family little is known except that he was a farmer named Clement who took his name from the village of Paston near the northeast Norfolk coast. His only son, William, born in 1378, somehow got himself a schooling, rose rapidly through the law, and began buying land in the north of the county. From the reign of Henry VII, the Pastons were one of the most powerful families in East Anglia, but backed the royal cause in the civil war and lost their property. With the second earl's death, all but bankrupt and without male heirs, on Christmas Day 1732, the Pastons were extinguished. Their monuments are a group of sensationally beautiful 17th-century tombs, the ruins of Caister Castle outside Great Yarmouth, and the letters. </p> <p>From William, and his wife Agnes, there are just a handful of letters. Their son, John Paston the first, was born in 1421. He married Margaret, daughter of a squire at Mautby, near Yarmouth, and came through her family to be intimate with an old soldier named Sir John Fastolf. Fastolf - Shakespeare's Falstaff - had served through the French wars, made a large fortune and retired to his brand new castle at Caister. Today, even in ruins, amid drifts of fly-tipped refrigerators, Caister looks far too big and well-fortified a house for a mere knight. </p> <p>When Caister passed in 1459 under the terms of a contested will to John I, the Pastons found themselves in way over their heads. John I wore himself out trying to establish his claim, and his son, John II, fared little better. In 1469, the Duke of Norfolk besieged the castle and forced its garrison, under the second son John III, to surrender. It wasn't until 1476 that the Pastons recovered the castle. In 1487, John III was knighted at the battle of Stoke by Henry Tudor and their position in the Norfolk hierarchy became stable. </p> <p>The capital theme of Castor's story is of a new type of family trying to make its way through money and the law amid bully-boy neighbours whose sole language is violence. In addition to the attack on Caister, the manor at Gresham was seized by Lord Moleyns in 1448, and Hellesdon (now in the Norwich suburbs) was sacked by the Duke of Suffolk in 1465. With the menfolk lobbying the crown or the courts in London, or serving with the army at Calais, it was usually the women, and especially John I's wife Margaret, who bore the brunt of the violence. When Gresham was overrun by Lord Moleyns's men, John I told the king, they \"mined down the wall of the chamber wherein the wife of your said beseecher was, and bore her out of the gates, and cut asunder the posts of the houses and let them fall.\" </p> <p>For their neighbours and, despite the glaring evidence to the contrary ever since the upheaval of the black death, gentlemen were born, not made. The Pastons were tarred by their enemies with villeinage - that Clement was just a \"churl from Gimingham\" near Paston - which theoretically disbarred them from holding manors. When in the next generation Marjery Paston sought to marry Richard Calle, the family's estate manager, who was descended from shopkeepers in Suffolk, John III revealed the anxieties of the true arriviste: he would not have his sister \"sell candle and mustard in Framlingham\". </p> <p>In the backwater that was Norfolk, the turbulence of the century is only a distant roar. Both John II and John III fought on the Lancastrian side at Barnet in 1471, but that was presumably because the Duke of Norfolk was in the Yorkist camp. Castor's great skill is to show how the Pastons' fortunes were tipped this way and that by the balance of forces in the great world of the court and the feuding nobility. It is a tricky business and she takes her speculations to the limits of the evidence. Her battle scenes - Barnet, Towton and Bosworth field - are tremendous. She also has a very clear idea in her mind of what sort of women Agnes and Margaret were, and what sort of men Johns II and III, and that helps her through patches where the evidence is thin. </p> <p>Amid the relentless attention to landed property, Castor tries to make the most of the lighter scenes, as when John II, in trying to enlist the support over Caister of the pregnant Duchess of Norfolk at a chance meeting in Yarmouth, pays a leaden gallantry that goes hopelessly awry. \"They say,\" he wrote in mortification to John III, \"I said my lady was large and great ...\" The two love stories, between Margery Paston and Richard Calle in 1469, and John Paston III and Margery Brews in 1477, are beautifully told. The second of these gave rise to the famous Valentine letters, so-called because they were dated in February 1477 and Margery addresses John III as \"her weleblouyd volentyne\". </p> <p>What Castor doesn't do is criticise the letters as literature. English had only just come to replace French and Latin in business. Yet the Paston letters show how supple and expressive the English vernacular could be. In 1468, John II engaged four professional soldiers to help defend Caister: \"sad and well advised men\", he wrote to John III, \"saving one of them which is bald and called William Penny, which is as good a man as goes on the earth, saving a little he will, as I understand, be a little cupshotten\". For all bald Penny's fighting qualities, once he'd had his drink, John III in the end had to surrender \"for lack of victual, gunpowder, men's hearts, lack of surety of rescue\". </p> <p>In the second of the two \"Valentine letters\" of February 1477, Margery Brews wrote to John III to say that her father was sticking over the dowry. She said: \"My father will no more money part withal in that behalf but \u00a3100 and 50 mark. Wherefore if that ye could be content with that good, and my poor person, I would be the merriest maiden on ground.\" Castor helpfully reproduces the letter in colour and you can see that it was in fact written by a professional, presumably Sir Thomas Brews's confidential clerk. It is not a private letter. The Valentines, for all their Shakespearian sweetness, are business documents just like the others. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> James Buchan's novels include Heart's Journey in Winter (Harvill).</p>",
  "<p><strong> Stephen Fry's Incomplete &amp; Utter History of Classical Music, by Stephen Fry and Tim Lihoreau (Macmillan, \u00a316.99)</strong> </p> <p>Stephen Fry is a man of many talents and has written some good books. Here he has apparently decided, as a kind of perverse literary experiment, to try to push the digressive and facetious style to such an extreme that it resembles pathological lunacy. It's a smashing success. No groan-inducing pun is passed up for section and chapter headings: \"Pass the Purcell\", \"Ringfluential\", and worse. Many games are played with typography; there are pointlessly invented composers' diaries and wince-making Carry On-toned historical context setting. There are jokes - \"Mozart, now, is the greatest thing to happen to music since someone burnt the blueprints of the banjo\" - and a relentlessly camp style: \"He's currently in a rather bum-punchingly uncomfortable coach, en route from Vienna to Prague.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the publishers were terrified that if readers found themselves more than 10 words away from a bit of toilet humour, they would fall asleep - because, after all, this is about that terribly boring subject, classical music. It needs \"enlivening\". Not coincidentally, the book derives from Fry's own series on Classic FM. I'm sure it sounded great on the radio, with the tunes and everything. </p> <p><strong> How to Be a Bad Birdwatcher, by Simon Barnes (Short Books, \u00a39.99)</strong> </p> <p>It says something about the comedic depths that Fry's book has plumbed that, in comparison, Barnes's chapter title \"Let's fill the whole screen with tits\" seems terribly charming, in an I-know-it's-very-obvious-but-it's-still-quite-funny-isn't-it way. This is a very likable memoir-cum-manual, in which it is argued that you don't have to become a fanatical \"twitcher\" in order to enjoy looking at birds. (Shooting them, by contrast, is frowned upon.) </p> <p>Looking at birds, Barnes argues, is a very cheap way to \"add to the joys of daily existence\". And to learn the names of more birds, and eventually to learn to recognise them in a flash (through a mental faculty called, oddly, \"jizz\"), is to deepen and reinforce these joys. Certainly it does me good to look at a roast chicken on my plate and to know, through \"jizz\", that it's a chicken. </p> <p>About live birds, though, I was still a bit sceptical, but then he mentioned the carmine bee-eater, which is about the only bird I've ever known the name of while looking at it (apart from, you know, pigeons), and I thought he might be on to something after all.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Naked Woman: A Study of the Female Body</strong><br> by Desmond Morris<br> 400pp, Cape, \u00a317.99<br> </p> <p>I wonder how many specimens Desmond Morris inspected before deciding that \"every woman has a beautiful body\", the statement which launches this book. Not enough, anyway, or he would surely have come across at least one that had gone wonky or started falling apart. He says our bodies are beautiful because they are \"the brilliant end-point of millions of years of evolution\". But you could say that about a slug. </p> <p>Still, the admiration evinced throughout Morris's \"guided tour of the female body\" will make a nice change for women who have come to detest their unwieldy carcasses for not resembling the bodies of unusually thin pubescent girls, and fear the consequences should they ever stop attempting to disguise the general wear and tear that men find so nauseating in our sex. With a lack of restraint that verges, occasionally, on the reckless, Morris rhapsodises everything that takes his fancy. Most memorably, hair, which stirs reflections on men's \"quest for the softly flowing locks they dream of caressing\". Even a woman whose hair or face is nothing to boast about may well be in possession of a working back, highly commended as \"a brilliantly assembled set of muscle and bones with the twin functions of body support and spinal-cord protection\". Other humdrum body parts are special, he points out, in being superior to the male equivalent. Female hands are singled out for praise, having \"far greater finesse when it comes to the delicate handling of small objects\". And, on looking down, one finds that one's hands are, in fact, rather nicely designed. Thank you Desmond. If only more men had your respect for the precision grip. </p> <p>It may seem a poor return for all these nice compliments, but beyond sharing his affection for body parts with which many of us are wearily familiar, it is not clear what Morris wants to say. Even his ardour occasionally grates. He does not consider the diseases that are apt to afflict the most brilliant end-point of evolution, nor does he notice the tedious, commonplace complaints that can leave the female body something less than beautiful. Feet, for instance, are all very well on the ends of our legs, but it seems pushing it, rather, to go on about how \"wonderfully they perform\", how uncomplainingly they \"effortlessly serve us and steer us through our changing environment\". Plainly, the man has never seen a bunion. </p> <p>But perhaps seen-it-all adult women are not the ideal tourists for this particular trip. Perhaps, as with Morris's celebrated The Naked Ape (1967), The Naked Woman's natural audience is composed of inquisitive adolescent boys. It certainly has a very promising bottom on the cover; though even the most eager schoolboy may be disappointed by the amount of space devoted to things like ears, noses and cheeks - and all the other bits of standard female equipment that are not, give or take a few hairs, really so different from his own. </p> <p>With breasts, bottoms and so forth, Morris is obviously on safer ground. If British sex education is in the sorry state indicated by our teenage pregnancy figures, then the more boys who learn the whereabouts of the U-spot and the elusive Anterior Fornix Erogenous Zone the better (a map or diagram would have been a bonus). The boys will also be intrigued - supposing it does not have a Ruskin-like effect on more delicate students - to discover the international variations in women's pubic hair. In the Far East, Morris discloses, \"the straight black head-hair is matched by pubic hair that has been described as 'black, short, straight and not thick but rather sparse ... forming a somewhat narrow triangle with apex upwards.'\" Young admirers of the Guinness Book of Records may also relish the many curious facts Morris has crammed into his appreciation. The merkin (pubic wig), inevitably, gets a look in. But did you know that there was once a French woman with \"no fewer than five pairs of fully lactating breasts\"? Or that in 15th-century Venice a law was passed requiring prostitutes to expose their breasts? No notes substantiate such easily forgotten asides, but nonetheless: just fancy. </p> <p>The Naked Woman abounds in these factoids; some interesting, some freakish, some dubious - many most amazing for the importance Morris attaches to them. We are familiar, of course, with the idea of cabinets of curiosities, collections of shells, bone, fossils. But one pictures this eminent zoologist with his Kinsey Report and Guinness Book of Records conveniently to hand, poring over sheafs of yellowed cuttings gathered over the years, carefully recording the fact that, in 2003, a woman with a tongue stud was struck by lightning in Corfu; or alighting on the story of another woman, in Connecticut, who attacked her unfaithful husband with her nails: \"The injured man required 24 stitches to close the wound in his scrotum.\" </p> <p>Not all Morris's anecdotes have been so laboriously collated. Once he has dealt, briskly enough, with the adaptive significance, physiology and function of a body part, most of his chapters rapidly decline into pages of loosely themed remarks that might look feeble if you found them in a child's project. Hairstyles, he notes, are not permanent.\"When the hair grows out, new styles can be tried.\" When it has grown, \"a ponytail can be a useful device to control untidy hair, both in the workplace and in the home.\" Musing on breasts, he notes that \"the combination of 'bra and panties' remains with us to this day as the favoured form of female underwear\". A lined forehead is \"a telltale sign that its owner is no longer young\". And so, some might say, is a book like this.</p>",
  "<p>Journalists were invited yesterday to inspect one of the new London Tube shelters, about which there have been many rumours, some of them rather extravagant. There are eight of these shelters, each with bunks for 8,000 people. They have been built under Tube stations, four on the north side of the Thames and the other four on the south.</p> <p>The shelters have all been built, with slight variations, to a common design which will enable them to become part of a new underground railway after the war. The basis of the design is two tunnels side by side, each of them 16 feet in diameter and divided by a concrete slab into an upper and lower deck, so that the height of each deck is some eight feet. This gives in effect four parallel tunnels, each about 1,200 feet long and provided with bunks for 2,000 people.</p> <p>Each of these four tunnels is divided into four sections by cross passages in which are the medical aid posts, lavatories, machinery control rooms, and so forth. In each of the tunnel sections there is a canteen or snack bar designed to serve hot drinks, sandwiches, and cakes, and, perhaps, hot pies. The bunks have been arranged in three tiers on both sides of the tunnels with a good deal of ingenuity; some of them fold up if required so as to form back rests for a lower tier of bunks and so provide comfortable benches for sitting during the early part of the evening.</p> <p>There are five entrances well distributed over the shelter. The biggest and easiest is a wide staircase from the Tube station above, which leads down to the central cross-passage of the shelter and so gives access to all parts. The other four entrances are from the ground outside, and each consists of a small emergency lift and a staircase descending side by side and finally reaching the upper decks of the tunnels at points midway between their ends and the central cross-passage.</p> <p>All parts of the shelter can be reached from all five entrances, so that even if four entrances are blocked by bombing none of the shelterers will be cut off from escape.</p> <p>There are altogether four medical aid posts, each of which, when the shelter is occupied, will be manned by a doctor, a sister in charge, and four nurses, all of them voluntary.</p> <p>The general running of the shelter will be in the hands of a staff of full-time wardens, assisted by part-timers and also, it is hoped, by volunteers from the shelterers themselves.</p> <p>The canteens in shelters south of the river will be run by the Women's Co-operative Guild, those north of the river by church organisations.</p> <p>When the Minister of Home Security does decide that circumstances warrant the opening of these new shelters the public will be informed and will be told at the same time which people are eligible to use them and what steps they should take. In the meantime no applications from anybody for tickets or admission to the shelters will be accepted.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article is drawn from the archive at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/newsroom\">Newsroom</a></p>",
  "<p>Some months ago I was trying to find out whether there had existed, in the 19th century, a printed handkerchief depicting the death of the poet Chatterton. I wanted to determine the meaning of the phrase used by John Clare, \"a pictured pocket handkerchief\". After much frustration, it occurred to me that I might try Google. I tapped in the words \"Chatterton\" and \"handkerchief\", and at once, so fast it somewhat scared me, the image of the object I was looking for came up on the screen.</p> <p>It then occurred to me that it might just be possible, among the ephemera for sale on eBay, to find, and even purchase, one of these handkerchiefs - perhaps the precise kind Clare described. This proved not to be the case, but in the course of the search I became acquainted with the world of the printed-handkerchief collector and its (perhaps limited) charms. And thus began an inquiry into the merits of eBay for the collector in general.</p> <p>Scarcely a day passes without some story of internet abuse, such as the recent nightmarish case of the teenager who, having defrauded his clients in order to finance stretch limos for his schoolfriends, contacted his victims to taunt them with accounts of his stylish life. But leaving aside the larger question of credit card fraud in general, and assuming that the reader is prepared to buy, say, a CD through Amazon, or a used book though Abebooks, what about - in theory - putting together a collection of something through eBay?</p> <p>The idea of devising an auction site which would attempt to be an honest or trustworthy society is in principle interesting. It reminds me of cock-fighting in the Philippines where, within the cockpit itself, honesty is a requirement. The placing of bets will only work, as a system, if the bets are honoured, and it is said that, by custom, if a man cheats in the cockpit, every member of the audience is entitled to give him one punch. The custom is enough to ensure honesty within the cockpit. Outside, in the barrio, all bets are off.</p> <p>The sanction on eBay is that any dissatisfied participant can leave a negative report on anyone with whom he or she has had dealings. When I consider bidding for anything, I can look at the vendor's record. Conversely, if I fail to pay for a purchase the vendor can give me negative feedback. People seem very sparing with the negatives in these feedback reports. The other day, checking a dealer's profile, I came across the remark (about a gold necklace): \"I think you might have gone easy on the words 'heavy' and 'diamond'\". And yet the purchaser was marking the deal with a positive.</p> <p>Over the days when an auction is taking place, one can see who is bidding, and by checking their sites one can form an impression of their interests. This makes an eBay auction quite unlike anything that takes place in the great houses. I know that I'm up against, say, \"sfgolfnut\" or \"purpleavenger\", and I can guess whether they are seriously interested in the item for sale, and (very important) whether they are likely to know its value. In an area of extreme specialisation - say, the coins of ancient Sogdiana - I would want to know (I would want to learn) what the going rate might be.</p> <p>A fellow eBayer contacts me and says: \"Watch out for that dealer you are buying from. His starting prices are too high, and he often has to sell on only one bid. What's more, he always cleans his coins, which I find offensive.\" Naturally I am glad of the warning, but I can check on the information he has given me, and form my own judgment. In this case, I detect some personal animus, and so I treat the warning itself with caution.</p> <p>\"Sniping\" is a frustration. An auction lasts, usually, for a week. During this time, my early bid stays unchallenged, but at the very last moment (a minute before end of sale) \"long-islandaardvark\" - or some such name - snatches my prize from under my nose. He sees I am about to get a bargain, and whisks it away. The only sure remedy for sniping is to leave a maximum bid which reflects your true sense of an object's worth to you. All bids are real, and if \"longislandaardvark\" wants to snipe me he can do so, but if I've left a high maximum bid he may well lose interest.</p> <p>Snipers are merely an aggressive form of \"bottom feeder\". The question is not whether an interesting collection (of anything) could be formed exclusively by bottom feeding. The question is whether a genuinely interesting collection could be formed, through eBay, out of items which, while individually cheap, collectively make something remarkable.</p> <p>Ephemera would fit the bill, but not just any ephemera. Ancient coins are chosen in this example as interesting ephemera. They are untypical, for ephemera, being made out of durable, indeed precious, metals. But unless they were collected, as coins or ornaments, they were and are, even today, melted down. At any one time there might be 6,000 or 7,000 ancient coins on eBay, most of them Roman. Very few from Sogdiana - which is not (of course) what I collect.</p>",
  "<p>The artist William Nicholson liked to give the impression of living and working outside history. Freezing his appearance in the dandified 1890s of his youth, his steady stream of landscapes, still lifes and portraits refused to fit into any of the grand narratives of early 20th-century art. While critics agreed - and continue to agree - that much of his work was fresh and even beautiful, they were disconcerted by the way it appeared to spring from a world that had not registered the presence of fauves and cubists, surrealists and constructivists. Given that Nicholson was sociable, money-driven and, in time, knighted, it has been all too easy to dismiss him as an old duffer who didn't so much lose the plot as fail to notice that there hadbeen one in the first place. </p> <p>But, as the new exhibition at the Royal Academy shows, to categorise William Nicholson's work as unthinkingly conventional would be to miss the point entirely. Although he refused to generate any kind of critical commentary on his output, that doesn't mean he wasn't a self-conscious artist, fascinated by the formal ambiguities that his own process threw up. His still lifes are deft examples of the genre, yet slyly subversive, too. Reflections bulge out from his favourite convex surfaces, shadows stand in for objects, compositions tumble out of the frame. In his portraiture, subjects refuse to face the canvas, society figures are dwarfed by anonymous settings and eye contact is always shy and shifting. Nicholson's landscapes, meanwhile, are full of games that challenge the viewer to remember that, while this may appear to be a view of deep space, it is actually a two-dimensional trick of paint on board. </p> <p>Nicholson started as a printmaker in the 1890s. Working with his brother-in-law James Pryde as the Beggarstaff Brothers, he produced the kind of cheap, bold images that were much in demand from the new advertising culture. Early successes making play posters led to the Beggarstaff Brothers producing a series of woodcuts for the publishers Heinemann, including the Alphabet Book and London Types. A Was an Artist (1897) is the first woodcut in the Alphabet series and shows a pavement artist collecting pennies for his work. The overall-clad figure is clearly Nicholson himself, and it speaks volumes about his anxiety as to whether he would be able to support his growing family through his work (his father, a Midlands iron master, was unlikely to prove a ready source of extra funding). Heavily influenced by prints from the early 19th century, the Beggarstaffs' woodcuts are stark and muscular, appearing to step out of history while remaining urgently contemporary. </p> <p>The print that really made Nicholson's name is that of Queen Victoria (1897). It shows the Queen as a virtual black triangle, her swollen bulk emphasised by the tinyness of the toy dog that trots beside her. Heinemann wouldn't touch it, worried that it seemed cheeky or even treasonous. The public, though, loved seeing its monarch as a favourite aunt, while responding to Nicholson's suggestion of Her Majesty's growing isolation and frailty. </p> <p>After several years of printmaking, Nicholson returned to his first love - painting. He still needed to make money, which is why he gravitated towards portraiture, taking commissions from aristocrats and academics. His best work, though, is drawn from people in his own circle, which was made up mainly of writers, including JM Barrie, Beerbohm and Kipling. In Max Beerbohm (1903), Nicholson gives us Beerbohm as we have never quite seen him before: dapper, but with his eyes apparently closed in deep weariness or even resignation. The full-length figure is set against a wall in Nicholson's favourite pale tawny, which at certain points becomes almost one with the canvas itself. </p> <p>The centrepiece of the Royal Academy's exhibition is The Canadian Headquarters Staff (1918), a group portrait of six officers standing informally in front of a large photograph of wartime bombing. Never seen before in Britain, this painting is a timely reminder that Nicholson was not simply a painter of the social and the everyday, but was able to take on big subjects (and, at 8ft by 9ft, it is easily his largest painting). In a typically Nicholsonian touch, the photograph of the shattered Cloth Hall at Ypres is painted in such a lush manner that it becomes less a record of desolation than a landscape of dreamy desire. But just to make sure that the viewer doesn't dissolve into it, Nicholson affixes a blank piece of paper to the photograph as a reminder that this, after all, is a mere representation. Meanwhile, the six Canadian officers who stand before the photograph may initially seem indistinguishable from one another with their crisp uniforms and tight little moustaches. Yet Nicholson cleverly grants them a range of body language and eyelines that effectively leads us through the painting, finally escorting us from the scene almost before we have realised what has happened. </p> <p>Within his own lifetime, Nicholson was best known for his portraiture, which eventually garnered him a knighthood in 1936. It is, however, on his still lifes that his posthumous reputation has tended to rest. It was here, in complete control of the image, that he was able to explore most fully his abiding interest in the use of high contrast to produce an effect bordering on optical illusion. The Lowestoft Bowl (1911) is, in one way, simply a picture of a dark bowl with a light interior standing on a large dark platter. However, the stark contrast between black and white allows the picture to be experienced both as a series of flat pools of colour, and as a three-dimensional likeness. What appears as a modest domestic painting becomes a sophisticated visual tease on careful viewing. </p> <p>Miss Simpson's Boots (1919) offers a different kind of challenge to the viewer. A pair of outdoor leather ankle boots sits side by side with some of kid-soft ivory silk. Alongside them is a gold pocket watch whose convex surface reflects the wall of blue. The textures are beguiling, yet the painting consistently refuses any attempt to impose a narrative upon it. We're not allowed to know who Miss Simpson is, nor why she has left her boots here. Instead, we are returned to what Nicholson really wants us to think about - the act of looking at the everyday details of someone's life and our instinct to turn them into a story. </p> <p>Nicholson's landscapes have that same ability to entice and resist the viewer's attempts at making meaning. Landscape at Harlech (1918) is a wonderful piece in which slate, shadows and sheep are muddled up in a series of choppy, oily brushstrokes. The only part of the picture that gives itself up immediately is the sky, painted in Nicholson's favourite cornflower blue. </p> <p>Even more graphic is Snow in the Horsehoe (1927), which uses the sharp contrast of pure white snow and deep shadow to create the impression of depth and distance, made even more startling by the tiny seated figure that magnifies the scale to make the landscape seem overwhelming. And yet, if you take half a step forward, the illusion dissolves into a series of fat stripes of flat colour. </p> <p>Nicholson's facility in so many genres did not help his reputation. It seemed, quite unfairly, to suggest a glibness, a lack of hard graft or serious thought at the centre of his work. He has suffered, too, by comparison with his eldest son, Ben Nicholson, whose output was so exquisitely alert to historical process and international influence. Ben's odd, Oedipally driven remark that the key to his father's work was that \"he merely wanted to paint\" was especially harmful, further reducing Nicholson to the status of enthusiastic amateur indifferent to wider contexts. </p> <p>In fact, as the RA's exhibition shows, William Nicholson's art was far more knowing and engaged than has previously been appreciated. If Nicholson only touched lightly on those fractures and stresses that other painters would work up into a whole programme or philosophy, it did not mean he hadn't noticed them or failed to understand their importance. It was simply that he had chosen another way. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>William Nicholson: British Painter and Printmaker is at the Royal Academy, London W1, from October 30 until January 23.

  "<p>Imagine your reaction if you saw two mullahs - long beards, flowing robes, white caps, the whole shebang - walking away from a church in Chipping Norton, talking about the Sunday service. Imagine hearing one muttering to another: \"All this Christ and resurrection stuff. Pfff. I am not impressed,\" and then concluding, with muted triumph, \"Preaching to the converted.\"</p> <p>It sounds ridiculous - and yet, this is the same attack that theatre has to endure week in, week out. \"Hah! Another play about social justice, humanity, and an individual's struggle to live in the world,\" say the newspaper, television and radio pundits. \"Pfff. Preaching to the converted.\"</p> <p>Who else do you preach to but the converted? Every public outlet plays to its own constituency. Most preaching is, and always has been, about bolstering the convicted. We need our preaching for affirmation and definition. We convert once, twice, in a lifetime. It's not preaching that does it. It's an odd reaction to the friction between our journey and the facts of the world.</p> <p>Theatre, meanwhile, does a pretty successful job of playing to every constituency. One of contemporary theatre's most popular writers, Tom Stoppard, is self-advertisingly right wing. The writers whose work still dominates the commercial theatre - Coward and Rattigan - aren't going to knock Trotsky off his perch. And we spend almost all our subsidy on Shakespeare, who certainly had an anarchist and a communist within him, but kept them well hidden beneath the petit-bourgeois, the royalist flatterer who ruled the roost. Yet every time a political play appears, the whole industry is smeared with the woolly liberal chattering-class jibe. And since there has been no shortage of political work recently, we have had no shortage of jibes.</p> <p>The present outbreak began before 9/11, when everyone woke from the End of History sleep of the 1990s to see Bush and Sharon hovering into view, looking far more Fu-Manchu than Fukuyama. Once 9/11 shocked us into a new reality, everyone felt a need to contribute some ounce of understanding. The theatre has to. The air that vibrates between actors and the audience is full of the dust of the moment, and if you ignore the particular nature of that dust, the theatre dies.</p> <p>The Tricycle Theatre led the way with its verbatim dramas: The Colour of Justice, The Hutton Inquiry, Guant\u00e1namo. My company, The Oxford Stage Company, produced a prophetic piece on American history by Eric Schlosser. And I have just directed, for the Tricycle, Sean O'Casey's masterpiece about oppression and terrorism, Shadow of a Gunman. The National has served up an electrifying talking point in David Hare's Stuff Happens. Why complain about living in a culture that is robust enough to challenge itself so regularly? Surely we should just be grateful.</p> <p>Hare has invented a new theatrical form - most akin to a Hogarthian lampoon, or those detailed political cartoons of the Victorian era, with paragraph-long punchlines underneath them. In a mobile theatrical framework, brilliantly performed vignettes follow fleetly one upon another, shifting dextrously from satire to opinion to information to debate. It is not a framework that can contain any great weight of heart, though Condoleezza Rice's rendition of Amazing Grace is disturbingly moving, and Colin Powell's indignation flares into life. It is also better suited to the sophisticated jackanapery of international diplomacy than to the tragedy of tens of thousands of Iraqi lives robbed of any future. Points are scored; hearts are not broken.</p> <p>Yet Hare's greatest achievement is one of content rather than form. He is the first playwright to convey the interconnectedness of international politics. In days of old, Sophocles would write of his city-state, Shakespeare of his nation-state. Now, there is little choice but to write of the world. Al-Qaida, oil and the internet have ensured that no man is, or will be, an island for a long time yet. Hare has brought that reality to the stage.</p> <p>This new form is one future for political theatre - a fertile one. But let's hope that not all future drama adheres so closely to its second cousin, journalism. Much recent political theatre is informed by the desire to be either a report or an essay. Getting the facts out there is good - putting them on stage gives them electricity they would otherwise lack - but it is not the same as a play. When Shakespeare wrote his great historical plays, he chucked everything in: nonsense about witchcraft, battle scenes, father-son stuff, pageants, philosophical introspection. History, the record of facts, was a release for the great heap of images inside him - not a clamp on his imagination.</p> <p>Theatre is a place of imagination, of compassion and of obsession. Much of the new journalism is too dry, too flatly written, too studiedly impersonal. Everybody leans on the authority of the everyday, rather than relying on the authority of the imagination.</p> <p>When they were first produced in the 1920s, Sean O'Casey's trilogy of plays about Ireland - of which Shadow of a Gunman was the first - had all the force of news. He wrote with a rich, wild extravagance about how a new sort of person was being forged in the crucible of the tenements. Yet his plays remained far distant from journalism. He found in the morass of compacted slum life a perfect mirror for the insanity of the Ireland of the time, where innocents were the prey of extremists, and where all actions became a display of political allegiance.</p> <p>For 70 years, these plays were owned by the problem that created them. Now, though, they can be seen as universal plays about oppression everywhere. Their relevance to the current situation in Iraq is unnerving. But once we have abandoned Iraq, and gone on to disgrace ourselves somewhere else, that relevance won't fade. The plays achieve a universality and a timelessness through their fully imagined life.</p> <p>It may be useful for dramatists to stop trying to ape journalism's task of making people understand. I think we are all sick of trying to understand the Iraq war. I am sure that nothing amuses George and Dick and Osama more than watching everyone burn all their energy up on understanding, while the three of them carry on merrily dynamiting the foundations of the crumbling palace of enlightenment. We need our theatre, and our art, to stop understanding, and to help us jump forward.</p> <p>Our greatest theatre, from Aeschylus through Shakespeare and Chekhov and O'Casey, has been about creating a new idea of the human. We need less opposition, less thrashing about in the open sea, arguing with the nearest body to hand, strangling and tugging each other under water. We need our artists to swim off in new directions, so that we can follow them. Hare, to his credit, posits this for Iraqis at the end of Stuff Happens. I don't think it's just the Iraqis who have to set their house in order.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Stuff Happens is in rep at the National Theatre, London SE1 (020-7452 3000), until November 6.

  "<p><strong> The Defender </strong><br> by Alan Gibbons<br> 192pp, Orion, \u00a34.99 <br> </p> <p>How do you get a young reader to take the time to consider some of the larger political or social issues of the day? Surely books dealing with topics such as global warming or homelessness could seem like a huge turn-off for many teenagers? Writers of teen fiction have always known, however, that if it's all wrapped up within a well-paced, imaginative story they can get their readers to mull over perhaps more than they themselves realise at the time. Alan Gibbons is one such writer extremely skilled in this surreptitious art. </p> <p>Gibbons was once better known for his computer-game/ alternate-universe fantasy The Legendeer, but his recent work has been aimed very squarely at tackling some of today's more contentious issues: racism in Caught in the Crossfire, domestic abuse in The Edge, and the problems of political asylum in The Dark Beneath. Eschewing fantasy metaphors and sci-fi imaginings, however, these books have made their point right here, right now, reading like modern thrillers. His latest, The Defender, is an unflinching account of the impact of growing up in Belfast during the Troubles, coupled with a fight-and-flight chase through the suburbs of a quiet English town. </p> <p>Fourteen-year-old Ian Moore returns home early from school one day to discover two forbidding Irishmen waiting on his doorstep claiming to be friends of his father and attempting to inveigle their way into the house. Ian is suspicious, then terrified when he spots the gun one of them carries. He runs, and the breathless chase that follows - through back gardens, shopping malls and even high up on the wind-whipped outside ledge of a tower block - makes up more than half of the narrative. </p> <p>While on the run, Ian slowly unravels the mystery of who these men are. It's revealed that his father was once a member of the Loyal Ulster Defenders, that he even assassinated a republican ring-leader, but took the decision to get out of Belfast when his young wife was killed owing to his involvement. The gunmen are his one-time associates looking for reckoning. Ian has to confront the fact that his father has a past he could never have guessed at. The battle in his mind between his love of his father and the resentment he feels at being forced to live in ignorance is as intense as the chase itself. </p> <p>Interwoven throughout these chapters are vignettes from the father's youth, explaining his upbringing, trying to discover how and why he swore an oath of allegiance to the Young Defenders. It may be the chase that keeps the reader gripped, with its cleverly placed cliffhangers, but it's through the father's memories that Gibbons explores what he wants to say about those caught up in the conflict. </p> <p>Sides are never taken; there is no specific condemnation of who did what to whom, because Gibbons is more interested in exploring the outside forces that contrive to make someone make certain irrevocable choices. One conclusion is that the Troubles feed off themselves: \"Violence and retribution hung around the place like a pair of vultures.\" Twice we are told to remember, \"there's always a man behind the gun\". Ian's father's choices are made through pride in his beliefs, outrage at what he sees around him and peer pressure. </p> <p>At a time when many writers for young people are determined to play down \"issues\" in their fiction, Gibbons seems to relish hitting them head on. His thrillers are guaranteed to keep the reader flipping the pages, but also to make them tackle subjects they may initially have shied away from. The Defender sees him continuing to plough his controversial, distinctive and personal furrow. Long may he do so. </p> <p>Keith Gray's Creepers is published by Red Fox.</p>",
  "<p>Orson Welles: The Stories of His Life, by Peter Conrad (Faber, \u00a39.99) </p> <p> \"Who would have dared to invent him?\" Peter Conrad asks of his overwhelming subject. Orson Welles is minutely scrutinised through the medium of his many roles - even the projects that never made it past the cutting-room floor. A self-styled Renaissance man, Welles is revealed as a master of propaganda, a shaman who turned the implausible into reality. Rather than a straightforward biography, Conrad presents, in a series of absorbing critical essays, a kaleidoscopic view of Welles's astonishing range of personas from Faust to Falstaff. Wisely refraining from offering a glib explanation as to why the creator of Citizen Kane degenerated into a washed-up gravelly voice advertising dog food, Conrad concludes that \"he lived the only way he could - ingeniously, recklessly and inconclusively\". The result is a brilliant testament to the allure of ego, delivered with a panache worthy of the great fabulist himself. <strong> CT</strong> </p> <p><strong> Library: An Unquiet History, by Matthew Battles (Vintage, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> A librarian himself, Battles manages to convey the unique excitement of discovering obscure, long-forgotten titles, even if, as he readily admits, \"most books are bad, very bad in fact. Worst of all, they're normal\", which is why \"we spend so much energy ferreting out the exceptional books\". A library, he reminds us, is \"a battleground of contesting ideologies\", especially in wartime. In 1914, a rich collection of incunabula and medieval manuscripts was lost for ever when German troops destroyed the Louvain library in Belgium. In fact, the 20th century was one of the most biblioclastic of all, from Nazi book-burnings to the bombing by Serbs of the Bosnian National and University Library in 1992. Having pondered these disasters - as well as the loss of many ancient libraries, not least those of Alexandria - Battles is led to one devastating conclusion: \"There is no library that does not ultimately disappear.\" <strong> IP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley, by Alanna Nash (Aurum, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> For once the word \"extraordinary\" doesn't seem out of place. Ostensibly a grinning southern good ol' boy in a cowboy hat, Presley's Svengali turns out to have been a figure a novelist would struggle to invent. Born Andreas van Kuijik in Holland, he slipped into America illegally, possibly fleeing a murder rap. After joining and deserting the army - his military title was later bought from a Louisiana governor - he found his true m\u00e9tier as a carnival hustler, with a sideline promoting country singers, which led him to Elvis. Superbly researched, Nash's biography sees Parker's early years as informing his indifference to Presley's artistic development and mental wellbeing. Ever the insecure fairground con man, he locked his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 into lucrative, but draining, movie deals and singing engagements that failed to stretch him - arguably, thereby, helping to destroy him. <strong>JD </strong></p> <p><strong> Bette Davis, by Laura Moser, (Haus, \u00a39.99)</strong> </p> <p> Bette Davis epitomised the bona fide star of Hollywood's golden age. An undeniable monster both on- and off-screen, her life was a perpetual battle for control with the requisite pushy mother, four husbands, a neglected daughter and, above all, with Warner Brothers, whose draconian contracts enslaved box-office draws such as Davis in the years before actors became self-regulating. Less conventionally beautiful than her contemporaries, she sought roles in which she could transform herself: at her peak, no one could match her powerful intensity. Laura Moser's efficient, compact biography neatly delineates the legend's life and times; stereotyped in later years into playing \"Hollywood's grande-dame ghoul\", Davis's waspish partnering with hated rival Joan Crawford in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane unravelled into a performance so grotesque it led her to admit that \"sometimes I even outdid myself - and it hurt\". <strong> CT</strong> </p> <p><strong> A History of Reading, by Steven Roger Fischer (Reaktion, \u00a39.95)</strong> </p> <p> This is a first-class account of an activity we largely take for granted. Fischer artfully keeps up the pace as he examines reading's many manifestations on stone, bark, tablet, scroll, book and computer screen. He reveals why reading in silence was revolutionary and explores the \"delightful practice\" of reading in bed. He explains how publishing became an industry and the book a mass-produced commodity. His analysis of the role of reading in religion is a model of its kind, in particular the veneration of the word among the Jews. Having celebrated the \"magic\" of reading - and paused to consider its neuro-psychological basis - he ends on a warning note: in the past decade \"a disquieting homogenisation of world literature has occurred\". US publishing is killing off local literatures and linguistic diversity, while the Harry Potter franchise signals the dystopian future of book publishing. We have been warned. <strong> IP</strong> </p> <p><strong> The Timewaster Letters, by Robin Cooper (Michael O'Mara, \u00a39.99)</strong> </p> <p> Aimed at the Christmas loo-book market, Cooper's comic offering is a re-run of William Donaldson's Henry Root Letters , but with trade bodies, obscure associations and small firms pestered by his fake persona, rather than the famous: sometimes a designer offering ludicrous ideas such as beef scarecrows or postmodernist mayoral maces, sometimes an enthusiast misinformed about an organisation's role. Touching testimony to the improbable survival of stoical British courtesy, the replies become less amiable or cease altogether only when follow-up letters are unmistakably deranged - and occasionally they continue even then. Despite jacket puffs from the likes of Ricky Gervais, the pranks are only fitfully successful, achieving their best results with oddly named societies such as the pottery-loving Friends of Blue (asked for a birthday message from the band). The editing should have been far more ruthless. JD</p>",
  "<p><strong>Adolescents, Envy of</strong><br> From the Shulamite of the Song Of Solomon, via the Beautiful Youth of ancient Greek poetry, to the 20th century, with its clean-limbed heroes, its gods of the playing field and coyly bountiful goddesses of the Parisian hat shop or Californian drive-in, and taking in every poetical and artistic venture between the two - the swoonful amours of Courtly Love, Juliet on her balcony, Donne's lethal love-bunnies, the intolerable posturing of the Romantics, big-chinned pouting Pre-Raphaelites and all the rest - a constant of our species has been its yearning envy of youth: the liminal land between childhood and the groaning yoke of adult life, when everything is possible. Everything, on the whole, meaning hope and passion. </p> <p>Not any more. </p> <p>The old envy was based on an ancient asymmetry: we gave you all this, and you repay the debt by being younger? By outliving us? By having opportunities which we have lost? </p> <p>But the bargain has been broken, the debt called in. Look at the world we have left to the hapless adolescents of the early 21st century. A world of food fads and neuroses, of exploitation through mass media. The affectless uniformity of the web. Danger lurking: perverts round every corner, terrorists in the shadows. A world where the sea kills fish, rain dissolves trees and sex means death. Of crumbling infrastructures, gridlock, collapsing health services. A world where only a few will be able to afford a house. A world of McJobs or no jobs or insane jobs which eat the whole of life. Where illusions are buried, childhood torn short, innocence drowned. A world of gendering and relativism, of spyware and databases, of political correctness. </p> <p>Hell of a world. As if adolescence weren't a hell of a world enough already. The Observer writer Euan Ferguson once drew a terrible picture of the Lynx-reeking, unspeakable-groined young male, hunched in its room, expressing itself in verse: </p> <p>Roses are red,<br> Violets are blue,<br> I hate my parents.<br> </p> <p>But the true horror is that they don't hate their parents, poor things. Most of them seem to quite like their parents, because their parents, realising the world they will inherit, don't envy them any more. Almost the reverse. The baby boomers know that nobody ever will have it so good again, young (as they were) in the magical times between the invention of the pill and the advent of Aids: a two-decade golden age, a Saturnalia, where the laws did not run. </p> <p>Poor adolescents. Bored by their music, stunned by their entertainment, living at home with parents who think of themselves as \"friends\", they are deprived of adventure, self-invention and the great treasure of being envied; and, worst of all, they are understood. </p> <p>Roses are red,<br> Violets are blue,<br> My parents are OK really.<br> </p> <p>And so the world goes to hell. </p> <p><strong>Ancients, Wisdom of the</strong><br> They were not. They were not wise. But one would have had to have lost one's wits entirely to believe that statement is enough; that one could say \"The Ancients were not wise\", and everyone would say, \"Gosh, I suppose you're right, we'd better shut up with all this pyramids nonsense, all this rubbish about magic and secrets and holism and, God help us, God.\" </p> <p>That is not the point of the Wisdom of the Ancients, which exists as a massive quasi-philosophical Lost Sock, or the memory of vanished love: that's to say, as something which we once had and, if we are very good and very careful, we might one day get back. </p> <p>The Ancients knew little and understood less. They scratched a living and died like dogs. Gripped by an uncomprehending egocentricity, they believed that the world had been made for them, and they believed that by a process of crude extrapolation: when they needed something, they made it. Finding themselves in a world which suited them to a remarkable degree, they assumed that it had been made for them; obviously, by someone much like them, but much bigger. Unable to understand any laws other than the law of will, they assumed that when something happened in nature, it happened because Nature commanded it. The river dried up because they had offended it; the volcano erupted because the Volcano Giants had not been placated; the harvest failed because someone - this is a bit of a leap of faith, but it leads eventually to Christianity, so it's all OK in the end - had not had his heart torn out and then been ripped limb from limb and his blood poured on to the soil. </p> <p>In short, the Ancients spent what thinking time they had trying to make phenomenological bricks without ontological straw. They were wrong about almost everything, hopelessly confused sequence and causation, left the scantiest record of their thinking, and croaked in short order. </p> <p>So why do people, even now, believe not only in the bits of the Wisdom of the Ancients that we know about (such as astrology) but also that there is a huge corpus of lost wisdom which, if only we could find it, would guarantee us a future of bliss, with no wars or sadness or cancer ever again, a world of birdsong and crystal and ... In our dreams. Specifically, in our dream that the world was created perfect, and has been drifting away from perfection ever since. \"The silver swan unlocks her silent throat\" - the initiates will spot Orlando Gibbons's great madrigal, the others get a pretty image, everyone's happy. </p> <p>Those who believe in the Wisdom of the Ancients disbelieve in any progress in human understanding. It is the intellectual equivalent of saying There's nothing worth watching on the telly any more or This so-called music the young people listen to, it's rubbish. In truth, it is not the Wisdom of the Ancients that we have lost; it's any fathoming of their true Ignorance. </p> <p><strong>Armchair, Favourite</strong><br> The true pleasures are in the little things. My grandfather had his Favourite Armchair and so did yours: green leather, uncut moquette, Naugahyde or Parker Knoll; adorned with an antimacassar or a brass ashtray on a leather strap; with or without a Smoker's Companion or a matching footstool: everyone had a favourite armchair. It was the guarantee of domesticity, the symbol of peace and power, the visible manifestation of order in the home. </p> <p>Admit to a favourite armchair now at your peril. The concept may be publicly lost. But \"publicly\" does not mean \"actually\". The favourite armchair was once a bastion against the outside world, a bulwark against time, an unchanging absolute in the face of fashion. Now you can buy a favourite armchair - pre-favoured, if you like - on the grounds that it is just like the one in Friends, on the TV. A La-Z-Boy Oasis recliner, to be precise, with a built-in beer fridge in one arm, a 99-number memory phone in the other, a heated back, and a 10-motor electric massager. It's so uncool it's cool. Not comfy, but ironic. Not favourite, but iconic. A style statement for the \"bloke\" with \u00a31,000 to spare. </p> <p>But its owners know the truth. It is as much a Favourite Armchair as anything your grandfather ever sat in. The only problem is this: can a single man have a favourite armchair? Probably not; because the whole point is that others must envy it, and want it, and plot to get it. The single man with a favourite armchair is like a child playing King of the Castle on his own: he may have gained the world, but he has lost his edge. </p> <p><strong>BO</strong><br> There once was a time when people smelled of people. Now we take one, two, or, in extreme cases, three baths or showers a day without thinking much about it, and apply deodorant afterwards; but there are plenty of people alive who can remember when \"bath night\" was a weekly occurrence, yet, strangely (if you believe the advertising), do not recall daily life as being unendurable because of the stench. </p> <p>Our modern habits of bathing would have been seen as extravagant and unnecessarily fastidious, or possibly even as evidence of an inner immorality. Taking too many baths was the mark of the irreligious, of those who had perverted a spiritual duty into a warm, slippery, fleshly indulgence, either for its own sake (dwelling too much on nakedness in the scented steam, who knows where the mind - or the fingers - might wander?) or as a precursor to more cooperative eroticism. </p> <p>Public bathing was no better. The great Thermae of ancient Rome were as notorious as houses of assignation and prostitution - the satirists Juvenal and Martial were particularly offended by this - where the aristocratic wife, stripped of the jewels and clothing that marked her rank, could fornicate with a muscular nobody or even a satirist (who could later walk home railing against the corruption in which he had so recently wallowed). The hammams of the Turks were associated with the unspeakable indulgences of odalisques or, if that was your fancy, boys. And we are still ambivalent; the squeaky-clean Scandinavian sauna has become shorthand for a commercial masturbatorium, in which a man who merely wanted to steam away his aches and pains would be regarded with suspicion. </p> <p>Reading texts written at a time when personal hygiene was what we would now call intolerable, and clothes were worn for months at a time without cleaning, our modern sensibilities are offended. \"By God,\" we say to ourselves, \"they must have stunk.\" </p> <p>Maybe they did. Maybe they didn't. But in what was the perfect paradigm of modern advertising, Lifebuoy soap once ran a radio commercial starring a foghorn which rasped \"BO\". The slogan: \"Your best friend won't tell you.\" Sheerest genius. Invent a problem and offer to sell the cure. We couldn't tell we smelt, do you see? And our best friend wouldn't tell us . The only answer: bathing every day with Lifebuoy. Soon, Lifebuoy was not enough; first came deodorants, then antiperspirants, and presently the horrors of the early-morning train and the 9am lift, overwhelmed by a cacophony of aftershaves and colognes and scented deodorants, until now an averagely well-groomed young urban woman can apply 400 chemicals (300 of which are synthetic) to her body every day of her life . </p> <p>BO may have gone, but so has the natural smell of humanity. Some, noting that California and Scandinavia led the USA and Europe respectively in both \"personal hygiene\" and divorce, have speculated that if we lose our smell, we lose our bonding ability. </p> <p>But what was that smell? How did it seem to the people who smelt it? What was it like then ? Did the Romans' clothes itch? Did medieval people shrink from kissing because of their foul teeth? Did our ancestors make love despite what we would consider their appalling hygiene, or did they simply not notice, or notice and like it? Travellers' accounts refer to the hugger-mugger arrangements in inns and lodging houses, three-in-a-bed and damp straw, but nobody refers to the smell. </p> <p>One of the rules of history is that people do not write about what is too obvious to mention. And so the information, having never been recorded, is now lost for ever. </p> <p><strong>Bachelors</strong><br> Stereotypes, of course. Holmes and Watson: Watson married, it's true, but he was still a bachelor. Rooms. Landlady. Fug. Habits. No; not habits; ways. You know how they get. Tobacco in the slipper, needle in the arm, bachelors . </p> <p>Or the Irish sort. Rooms; no, not rooms: digs. Then there's the Bachelor Feline, exemplified by Uncle William Boot in Scoop, dreaming of rooms - no, chambers - in Jermyn Street, morning saunters between bootmaker, tailor and club, feline prowlings after dark. The Bachelor Dissolute (Madeira, Bentley, first editions and showgirls), the Bachelor Advantageous (James Bond, The Saint, The Toff), the Bachelor Despondent, shabby, pale, penurious. The Bachelor Academic, cloistered, collegiate and absent-minded. The Bachelor Spiritual: Jesus and all his celibate followers. And, of course, the Bachelor Comic: Morecambe &amp; Wise, Matthau &amp; Lemmon, Vladimir &amp; Estragon. </p> <p>We won't be doing with bachelors now. We suspect them. A few generations ago, the bachelor, un-hamstrung by domesticity or the call of the bedsprings, was considered more of a man, freer to preach or fight or build or conquer. Now, he is less. So much less that we cannot acknowledge him as such. He is denied a status, merely accorded a state. He is ... single. And when he leaves the room, we glance at each other and the unspoken question hangs in the air. What, exactly, is he? He can't be just a bachelor. </p> <p><strong>Banks, Proper</strong><br> Never mind internet log-on and call centres, credit cards and direct debits and customer service hosts; let us recall Mr JG Harding, manager of the Midland Bank. He wore his Mister like a hard-won honorific, and JG could have been anything; Jehosophat Galitzine, possibly, though John Graham is perhaps more likely. </p> <p>Mr JG Harding seemed (though he might not have been) portly, a man of overwhelming substance, pinkly shaven, grim-suited, the epitome of gravitas as he steepled his fingers across his virgin blotter. To reach him - in response to a summons, in which he invariably expressed disappointment - you crossed the marble-floored, mahogany-countered, high-ceilinged, ecclesiastically hushed banking hall; were admitted through a locked, bolted door; walked along further corridors being eyed with speculative contempt by financial illuminati glancing up from their ledgers, and finally into the manager's office. </p> <p>This was proper banking, and all banks were like it. Not the phony gravity of modern parodies, the so-called \"premium bankers\" designed to make arrivistes feel important; these were not so much the cathedrals as the criminal courts of money, and we were not so much customers as defendants. Everyone eventually left school; but as long as you had a bank account, you would be a schoolboy for the rest of your life. </p> <p>Now, like parents, the banks want to pose as our friends; until, that is, we need to talk to a human being, at which point we realise that they have entirely resigned control to their computers, and all of them, all of them, are in the end helpless before the software. </p> <p>But then ... then, they were run by inhuman beings. Proper Banks. Banks which, unlike the claims of their sillier modern counterparts, liked to say \"No\". </p> <p><strong>Cash</strong><br> A rum thing, cash; its cover blown, its probity knackered, it now only excites suspicion or pity, depending on the sum. Deposit the dodgiest cheque (Luca Weasolio Enterprises (Cocaine) Ltd) and no questions asked; unpeel a fat roll of banknotes and there will be whispered conversations, messages passed to dyspeptic men in Compliance Divisions. Go into a supermarket and pay for your small order with cash, and eyebrows will be raised. Cash means you have no cards; no cards mean you have no credit; no credit means that you are on the margins, on the busk, a criminal, a bogus asylum-seeker, an underclass hoodlum, on drugs, a ticking bomb about to burst into tattoos and erupt at the checkout counter in a flurry of laaaaaaaager, swear words and screaming children. </p> <p>There was once an advert which claimed that the American Express card said \"more about you than cash ever can\", and so it does. Cash says nothing except \"Here is the money\", and we don't like that. Curiously obsessed with provenance, we find anonymity distressing. There is no added value to cash. All you can do with it is pay. Soon it will be confined to liminal transactions with hookers, crooks, Latvian navvies on the lump. The wedge of fifties is now a mark of failure, not just anonymous but, however big, finite. With a black AmEx, nobody can tell how much you have left. Cash cannot bullshit. Cash tells no lies. And so we no longer trust it, and so it must go. </p> <p><strong>Disney, Honeyed Meretricious Sentimentality of</strong><br> What happened to Disney? Surely Disney was once the articulator of childhood creativity, making manifest the gorgeous particoloured miracle of the unfettered imagination ... and then didn't it all go wrong, and the thing become corporate pap, a sort of cowardly, sentimental porridge, all complexity and ambiguity ruthlessly suppressed in the name of increased market share? Isn't that what happened? And then the corporate battles, and the septuagenarian Roy Disney, nephew of the great Walt - Walt was great, wasn't he? - locked in an embarrassingly public bout of fiduciary name-calling and hair-pulling with CEO Michael Eisner? Isn't that what happened? </p> <p>And shouldn't we be glad that it's happened, because Disney sprayed and deodorised and infantilised and pur\u00e9ed and blanded everything it touched, from the crypto-egalitarianism of The Jungle Book to the vicious peculiarity of Pocahontas? Shouldn't we rejoice that it's gone? </p> <p>Not as such. It was always more complex. Did we like Disney? Not really. Fantasia mystified and scared us by turns. Dumbo was just downright peculiar. Uncle Walt himself was a white-supremacist, commie-fearing, obsessional weirdo. And as for the damnable mouse ... when I was about four, my mother in hospital having trouble while expecting my sister, my father rented a Mickey Mouse film which he showed (after all the usual fuss with trying to find the screen, failing, pinning a sheet to the wall, getting the film on backwards, tripping over the projector flex) just before bedtime. </p> <p>Mickey had been left alone to mind the children, just like my father. There was trouble with the feeding bottle, during which Mickey got the teat stuck on his nose. He pulled and pulled and pulled; at last the teat came away, leaving him with a hideously extended snout like Pinocchio. </p> <p>Some time later that night, I woke screaming. </p> <p>\"Mickey!\" I howled. \"Mickey! Mickey Mouse with the long nose! Mickey with the long nose and he's under the bed !\" </p> <p>\"Don't be silly,\" said my father. \"There's nothing to be frightened of.\" </p> <p>\"Under the bed! Under the bed with the long nose!\" </p> <p>\"No,\" said my father, \"he's not. Look. I'll look for myself and that'll prove he's not\" - he bent down - \"under the Oh my God, Oh my God, it's Mickey with the long nose!\" </p> <p>Eventually I calmed down. But I never forgot. And many years later I reminded him. </p> <p>\"Oh, for God's sake,\" he said irritably. \"Look. You've got a four-year-old child who's having nightmares because he thinks Mickey Mouse is under the bed. It's the opportunity of a lifetime. What would you have done?\" </p> <p>I saw his point. And I think, too, that I saw Uncle Walt's point. The man was a genius. Not as an animator; not as a weaver of lovable coochie-coo butterscotch and twinkle; but as the inventor of a way of scaring the hell out of children without their parents having a clue. So on the grounds that one can forgive anything if it's done from genuine malice, let us forgive Disney his eponymous Land, the Mouse, Tinkerbell and all those terrible Fred MacMurray movies. Malice in Wonderland? What else is there? </p> <p><strong>Doctors, Proper</strong><br> You go along and you are, to be frank, worried sick. Worried and sick. And there's the doctor: someone you would ideally like to be a cross between God and an old-fashioned parson, but instead it's some disgruntled but caring person who has been on courses about empathy and body language and nonjudgmental ungendered relativism, and speaks with a soothing voice while sitting next to you instead of behind a desk like a proper doctor, and calls you by your first name, when you are feeling (vide supra) worried and sick and you want to be called Mister at the very least, possibly even Sir, or, if it's cancer, \"old chap\". \"Old chap\" will do very nicely, as in \"Well, old chap, I'm afraid your number's up. Can't say when, but my advice is, don't worry, but, equally, don't start any long books. Short stories and an early night - oh, and try to keep your bowels open.\" </p> <p>You won't get it. It's all about collaborative consensual patient-care programmes (or, probably, programs) and, above all, non-paternalistic. But still one yearns. Many years ago, the British Medical Association held a conference on The Doctor/Patient Relationship. At the end, the chairman, a patrician old chap called Elston Grey Turner - triple-breasted, five-piece suit, watch-chain, white moustache, stood up and said: \"Well, it's all been very interesting, particularly for those who are concerned about the doctor/patient relationship. For my own part, the doctor/patient relationship has never troubled me overmuch; I look across my desk and think, 'I'm the doctor, he's the patient.' \" </p> <p><strong>Finisterre</strong><br> Finisterre. Finis terrae: the end of the earth. Gone. It was there for ever, or so it seemed, introduced by the trite, comforting melancholy of \"Sailing By\". For cosy landlubbers rocked in the arms of the bedclothes or cradled in the seats of their warm cars, the Shipping Forecast is as glamorous and as soothing as the sound of a gale howling outside a warm bedroom: the marker of a world outside, dangerous and capricious, from which the listener was mercifully protected. </p> <p>It keeps curious, almost liturgical, company, not chanted but almost intoned in an ageless rhythm: Viking, North Utsire, South Utsire, Forties. Cromarty, Forth, Tyne. Dogger, Fisher, German Bight ... Humber, Thames, Dover; Wight, Portland. Plymouth, Biscay, Trafalgar, Sole; Lundy, Fastnet, Irish Sea. Shannon. Rockall; Malin; Hebrides, Bailey, Fair Isle, Faroes, South-east Iceland. </p> <p>While it may be Radio 4 - zippy, businesslike, modern - the rest of the time, on the Shipping Forecast, it is still the BBC Home Service, and Britain still a great maritime nation; the Lord is in his heaven, looking down upon a nation in handknitted jerseys, a pipe-smoking, Meccano-building, hobby-practising nation built upon decency and the cadences of the Book Of Common Prayer. And the Shipping Forecast a secular compline. </p> <p>So we move from the end of the Earth to our end on the Earth. But Finisterre, which once stood between Biscay and Sole, vanished in 2002, replaced by FitzRoy, just as Heligoland was driven out in 1956 to give way to German Bight. It is appropriate; Admiral FitzRoy introduced the first weather forecasts in the Times in 1860 and was a notable inventor of barometers. We cannot grudge FitzRoy his late, nocturnal celebrity; but it comes at a cost. In its sound as well as its meaning, Finisterre epitomised the sea, literally the end of the Earth. Now it is only commemorated in snuff, and in the last lines of Carol Ann Duffy's Prayer: </p> <p>Darkness outside. Inside, the radio's prayer - <br> Rockall. Malin. Dogger. Finisterre. </p> <p><strong>God</strong><br> \"God? Gone?\" you may cry in alarm. But it is true, at least partially. The greatest difficulty we face in understanding the past is the idea that religious faith of some sort was, intellectually at least, ineluctable. You had no option. Even apparent rationalists like Descartes or Newton got upset when they found their reasoning threatening to remove God from their picture of the world, because to remove God was to pull the ontological rug from beneath their own phenomenological feet. There was simply no alternative . Only recently - in the last blink of an eye, in terms of human history - have we had any way of dealing reasonably with a universe relieved of the awful presence of God. </p> <p>Now, though, we do have a satisfactory alternative, and, armed with the ideas of natural selection through random mutation, of complexity as something which can emerge from simple systems arising by the operation of normal probability, of the application of textual scholarship and historiography to \"sacred\" texts, and of an understanding of the physical underpinnings, if not of the entire cosmos, at least of our place in it, God has become optional. </p> <p>And an optional God is a weakened God, and a weakened God is no longer an omnipotent God. The spaces left which require God to fill them are now so small that we may see this once tremendous and ineffable creation of ours reduced to the status of an alternately chummy and capricious ghost. </p> <p>In a less developed world than ours, God's defenders would block their ears and minds, and hum loudly to drown out the noise of reason for fear that they might find it harsh and be driven to madness, and the greatest geopolitical power in history would stand with its religious finger in the rational dyke, suffering grief and monsters rather than rethink its first principles, while lesser powers would live in intellectual subjection and kill and die for their own tribal interpretations of the precise nature of the dethroned god. </p> <p>Finally liberated from the Great Succubus, though, we can at last be free to celebrate ourselves, our diversity and creativity, and the magnificent impersonal random luck that brought us here: to create great art and drama and literature and music to enrich our own and only lives. Can't we? Can't we? Can't we? Can't we ...? </p> <p><strong>Jantzens</strong><br> Imagine swimming trunks and bathing costumes made before swimming-trunk and bathing- costume technology arrived. Imagine them made from a sort of wool which absorbed 10 times its weight in water, so that when the wearer rose from the sea, he (if male) would be debagged by gravity and she (if female) would be sporting a gangsta knee-crotch and the belly of a dropsical Falstaff. And yet they were yearned for. They were so yearned for. </p> <p><strong>Opportunities, Lost, for Doing Something about Rock'n'roll</strong><br> \"It's much too late to do anything about rock'n'roll now,\" said Jerry Garcia. So it is. </p> <p><strong>Patchouli</strong><br> Synecdoche is a rhetorical term in which the container and the thing contained are used interchangeably, as in \"Pass the milk\" when we really mean \"Pass the bottle in which the milk is contained\". </p> <p>Patchouli is a sort of olfactory synecdoche, the scent of the 1960s, heavy, sweet/sharp, cloying, woody and all-pervasive. It was popular because it was said to act as a sort of containment device for the smell of hashish. And it may well have done. It was just of no significance, because the moment you smelt patchouli, you knew there was dope being smoked. </p> <p>It doesn't matter now. Who the hell cares? And so patchouli has fallen from favour. </p> <p><strong>Radio, Car, Removable</strong><br> A fine irony, barrelling along on a beautiful day with Joni Mitchell on the radio singing Don't it always seem to go That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone; They paved Paradise, put up a parking lot ... </p> <p>Which would be all very well, except they didn't. They promised to - that's where the parking charges were supposed to go, that's where the fines were supposed to go - but they didn't. Get to the other end and it's onstreet parking if you're lucky; and, what's more, you know all too damn well what you've got or how could you tell that it's gone? </p> <p>By the broken glass, if it was a car radio; by the wires sprouting out of the derelict empty hole; by Joni Mitchell, abruptly silenced. Eventually we got sick of it, and technology came to the rescue with the removable car radio, the only drawback being that you had to remember to remove it. </p> <p>And so the composer Michael Berkeley removed his radio and his mobile phone, did the necessary juggling with the keys and bits and pieces, let himself into his house, came back for the few bits and pieces he'd left by the kerb, and found that the artists' portfolio containing the notes, sketches and piano reductions for his opera Jane Eyre had gone. </p> <p>The brain tries to help in such circumstances, coming up, if possible, with a plausible story. The first terrible, lurching despair is followed by an equally terrible, lurching hope. Berkeley had been working on the score at his house in Wales; maybe that's where it still was. He hadn't packed it all up carefully! He hadn't put it in the car to bring back to London! He hadn't left it by the side of the car for 30 seconds! And no opportunistical ratbag slime-sucking thief had come and stolen it, no sir! </p> <p>Yes sir. </p> <p>So after the initial hideous shock, and rejecting the temptation to simply not do it at all, he squared his shoulders and executed the Carlyle Manoeuvre and started again, finding in the process a curious sense of liberation, and coming up in the end with a tighter, more disciplined work. </p> <p>Technology once again came pre-emptively to the rescue. Not in the sense that Berkeley switched over to working on his PowerBook, using the Sibelius program and backing up his work, thus benefiting from the computer's great gift to us all: the power of ubiquity, so that the same thing may be in many places at once. </p> <p>No; the real technological change was simply this: he instinctively went for the root causes of the trouble, and bought a fixed car radio. A retrograde step? No. And perhaps the car radio is a modern sin-eater or scapegoat; perhaps, like mugging-money, its real function is to be stolen, to take the bullet, to stand between us and greater harm. Not so much a hostage to fortune as a down payment on our luck. Don't it always seem to go ... </p> <p>Yes. It does. And that's the point of it </p> <p>\u00a9 Michael Bywater, 2004. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> These are edited extracts from Lost Worlds, What Have We Lost, &amp; Where Did It Go? by Michael Bywater, published by Granta next week at \u00a312.99.
