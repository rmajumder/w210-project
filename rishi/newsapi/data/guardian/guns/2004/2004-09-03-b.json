  "Senior ministers are trying to soften the impact of legislation paving the way for 24-hour drinking amid warnings it will fuel antisocial behaviour. <p>Although the Licensing Act was approved almost 14 months ago after lobbying from the drinks industry, it has yet to be brought in because of disagreements between government departments. </p> <p>Under pressure from chief constables, the Home Office feels that the legislation, promoted by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, runs the risk of further straining police resources. </p> <p>The Department of Health believes it could undermine the vaunted alcohol harm reduction strategy, launched by Tony Blair last March. </p> <p>A crucial element of the strategy is tackling drink-related disorder in town and city centres while improving treatment and support for people with alcohol problems. </p> <p>The act will transfer licensing from magistrates to councils, but regulations setting out how it will work have yet to be issued. Town halls can start receiving applications from February, with the powers fully implemented in November next year. </p> <p>Authorities have yet to be told what fees to charge for the licences. Although draft regulations suggested \u00a350, councils have warned they will have to be four times higher to pay for extra staff. </p> <p>\"The whole thing is a shambles,\" said one senior official. \"The Department for Culture miscalculated badly after lobbying by the industry.\" </p> <p>Andrew Bennett, the Labour chairman of the Commons local government committee, said the act had been dreamt up by the \"Islington set ... people not in the real world\". </p> <p>He said: \"The whole thing is crazy, with the prospect of creating more problems in town and city centres, and it is clear there is an argument in the government because of clear conflict between two policy issues.\" </p> <p>Insiders say John Prescott's local government and regions department, battling to keep council tax bills down in 2005 - a likely general election year - is pressing for \"realistic\" fees to avoid councils being left with multimillion pound deficits. </p> <p>Westminster city council, which will become the largest licensing authority as it embraces the West End, Soho, Leicester Square and much of Covent Garden, estimates the act will cost an extra \u00a32.5m. </p> <p>Simon Milton, the Tory council leader, has written to Mr Blair: \"I have told him this will go horrendously wrong and jeopardise the antisocial behaviour agenda.\" </p> <p>Jane Roberts, the Labour leader of neighbouring Camden, also told Mr Blair of her concern at a Downing Street summit on antisocial behaviour. </p> <p>\"I pointed out the problems to him and he replied, 'Have we got the balance wrong?' and I said, 'Yes, I think we have',\" she said. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Drinking alcohol frequently in your 40s and 50s is linked to mental impairment in old age, researchers have claimed. </p> <p>The study, by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and reported in the British Medical Journal, found that those who drank no alcohol also had an increased risk of mild mental difficulties in later life. </p> <p>The study followed more than 1,000 men and women for about 23 years.</p>",
  "The home secretary's commitment to end the routine use of prison to hold immigration detainees has been honoured and the practice ended in January 2002 (Asylum seekers still held in jail, September 1). It was made clear that exceptions would have to be made for reasons of security and control, ie an individual's behaviour posing a threat to the running of the centre. <p>The emergency requirement to transfer detainees from Harmondsworth was clearly an exceptional situation, brought about by the actions of the detainees in forcing the closure of Harmondsworth. Most will be moved back to the immigration removal estate. Those moved from Harmondsworth include failed asylum seekers and other immigration offenders. Most will have been found to have no legal right to remain. There is no reason why an immigration detainee cannot be removed from the UK direct from a prison.<br><b>Des Browne MP</b><br>Immigration minister</p>",
  "Universal sympathy with Russia over the hostage crisis was tempered yesterday by severe criticism of those responsible for dealing with it. <p>Russian security chiefs last night sought to deflect blame by saying the decision to storm the school was unplanned. Critics of the operation, including former SAS soldiers, said yesterday that that was precisely part of the problem. </p> <p>\"The FSB (Russian security service) had no plan; they were sitting there like puddings,\" said Hugh McManners, a former Royal Marine commando and now writer on special forces. </p> <p>What made a horrific situation worse was the lack of coordination between different elements of Russia's security and police, and the failure to cordon off a large area around the school. </p> <p>Anxious and nervous parents - some of them armed - were allowed to congregate near the school, while some hostage-takers were able to escape and take refuge in another building. </p> <p>There appeared to be a complete lack of command and control, observed Eddie Stone, a former sergeant in the SAS. </p> <p>John McAleese, part of the SAS team which broke the Iranian embassy siege in London, said the Russian authorities had carried out one of the worst hostage rescue attempts he had seen or heard about. </p> <p>He called the operation an embarrassment. \"There was no containment; people were walking about within 100m of the school, well within the range of the terrorists' rifles. </p> <p>He added that Russian military chiefs had failed in their basic planning. \"They should have made some plan in case it went wrong. When the shooting started, there was no military back-up. It was total chaos. Troops did not seem to have radios to communicate.\" </p> <p>Other former SAS soldiers expressed astonishment that the Russian authorities did not seal off two separate areas, one close to the school for the elite Alfa Brigade of Russia's special forces, with the outer cordon reserved for the police. </p> <p>Harry McCallion, a former SAS soldier turned barrister, expressed \"tremendous sympathy\" with the Russian special forces. He said their training was based on British principles. The first principle was not to launch an assault unless hostages were in danger. However, there should always be a clear plan, Mr McCallion and other former special forces soldiers said, precisely to cope with the unexpected. </p> <p>A carefully prepared \"immediate action plan\" should have been executed as soon as the terrorists started killing their victims, the former SAS soldiers say. However, they also concede that different tactics will have to be used against the types of hostage-takers Russia is having to confront over Chechnya. </p> <p>Such groups do not mind killing themselves as well as others, and had no \"exit strategy\", making the role of negotiators virtually redundant, said Mr McCallion. Yet this time, the hostages fled as soon as they could. </p> <p>\"[Russian special forces] should have planned an assault the first night and hit hard and fast,\" Mr McCallion added. The suggestion is that special forces in all countries, not just Russia, should rethink their tactics. </p> <p>The term spetsnaz covers the special operations units of various Russian bodies from the emergencies ministry to the tax police. The key counter-terrorist unit is the Alfa Brigade, believed to have 200 to 300 members. </p> <p>Set up in 1974 in response to the wave of terrorism in western Europe and the Middle East, the Alfa units, coming under the KGB and its successor, the FSB. They were modelled on the SAS, the American Delta forces and the Israeli Mossad units. </p> <p>While widely respected internationally, the Alfa units' record is mixed. Its troops played the key role in the de nouement of the Dubrovka theatre siege in Moscow almost two years ago, using gas to knock out Chechen suicide bombers. </p> <p>They then surfaced from the sewers and executed 18 unconscious female suicide bombers with shots to the head, according to a participant who recounted the exploits to a Moscow newspaper. </p> <p>The gas also killed 129 civilian hostages, for which Vladimir Putin was much criticised. Alfa would argue it was following orders and succeeded brilliantly. The political fallout was the Kremlin's problem. </p> <p>A notorious early Alfa operation was that used to launch the Soviet war in Afghanistan in December 1980 when the units stormed the presidential palace in Kabul and assassinated President Hafizullah Amin. Alfa was intimately engaged in the Afghan war and in Chechnya throughout the 1990s. </p> <p>A former Russian military intelligence officer, Stanislav Lunev, complained that the brigade was \"degraded\" and demoralised by the political manipulation it suffered in the political battles surrounding the collapse of the Soviet Union, with the KGB seeking to use it in the hardline 1991 plot against Mikhail Gorbachev, and the then Russian president Boris Yeltsin also using it as an instrument of power when shelling the Russian parliament in 1993.</p>",
  "It descended into blood, panic, violence and tragedy. None of the children, parents and teachers killed and wounded in Beslan deserved this barbarism. The children who set off for the first day of school on Wednesday, wearing their new clothes and holding their balloons, could not have been a more innocent target, the anguish of their teachers and parents more undeserved. <p>Beslan is an extreme example of what is rightly seen as a depraved military tactic. But the equally unpalatable truth is that hostage taking is also a rational tactic in the desperate context of asymmetrical warfare. Despite the likelihood of a bloody end to most hostage situations, they are likely to grow more, rather than less, frequent. </p> <p>At first sight the appeal of hostage taking is questionable: the hostage takers rarely achieve their stated objectives and often die in the attempt. There is nothing in Putin's record or in that of his security services to suggest that a peaceful solution in Beslan was likely - or that respect for the lives of the hostages would predominate over the political need to end the crisis quickly. Preserving lives takes time. Putin's interest, as it has been in Chechnya, is to create an impression of overwhelming force to pacify domestic anxiety. The hostage takers knew from the outset that they were likely to die. </p> <p>Hostage taking has not always been so unrewarding. In November 1986, an American hostage was released by an Iranian group that had held him captive for more than 17 months. His release had been bought by the Reagan administration with the transfer of military spare parts for Iran. Despite official denials, governments from Washington and Bogota to Paris have sometimes found it convenient to negotiate the quiet release of prisoners. In doing so they created a double bind. Negotiating improved both the life chances of the hostages and the leader's image: a return in triumph was better than a tragic outcome. But rewarding hostage-taking also raised the incentives: as long as something could be gained, the practice was risky, but in some sense profitable. </p> <p>Today's hostage-taking, though, from Iraq to Ossetia, is more savage, born of the spread of asymmetrical warfare that pits small, weak and irregular forces against powerful military machines. No insurgent lives long if he fights such overwhelming force directly. His tactical success has always been in surprise and in picking his target. If insurgent bullets cannot penetrate military armour, it makes little sense to shoot in that direction. Soft targets - the unprotected, the innocent, the uninvolved - become targets because they are available. If the hostage-takers in Beslan knew they were likely to die, they also knew they would die with the world's attention upon them. Had they died in a regular firefight with Russian forces, we would neither have known nor cared. </p> <p>In asymmetrical warfare everyone is involved and anyone is a potential victim. To promise that security in such conflicts will result from the deployment of large military machines is a sham. To fight asymmetrical war with tanks makes as much sense as trying to shoot mosquitoes with a machine gun. The result is counter-productive. </p> <p>As the drama of Beslan was entering its final hours, George Bush was bidding for re-election on the promise of security to the American people, a security premised on the willingness to use overwhelming military force. It was the same promise that Putin gave to the Russians and Ariel Sharon to the people of Israel. All three have used violence freely in pursuit of electoral reward: Sharon's provocative visit to the Temple of the Mount that triggered the second intifada, Putin's reckless adventurism in re-launching the Chechen war in 1999, and the Bush invasion of Iraq. None has produced the peace or security that was their justification; all have generated more violence and widened the circle of killing far beyond the formal engagement of armed men on both sides. Now the most likely victims are the poor and the helpless, as collateral damage, bombing casualties or hostages. </p> <p>In Iraq last week, the resources of the French state were, rightly, mobilised to try to save the lives of two French journalists who are now as familiar to everyone in France as Terry Waite was in Britain during his ordeal in Lebanon. But the names of the 12 Nepalese workers gruesomely murdered last Tuesday have not even been published in most of our newspapers. In hostage-taking, too, there is a hierarchy of importance. </p> <p>The Nepalis were victims twice over. They came from one of the world's poorest countries, which suffers the legacy of a rapacious aristocracy who built lavish palaces while denying even basic education to the majority. Today a tiny elite still dominates business and commerce while the mass of the people suffer the familiar catalogue of deprivation. To add to the country's misery, Nepal is in the grip of its own \"war on terror\". An increasingly successful Maoist rebellion now operates in 73 out of 75 districts in Nepal in an insurgency that has cost 10,000 lives in eight years. When the Maoists declared Kathmandu under siege, nothing moved. When they order foreign businesses to leave, they obey in increasing numbers. </p> <p>The government has responded with force, but there is no military solution in this war on terror, any more than in Iraq, Chechnya or Palestine. An outright victory by either side in Nepal could only come at appalling cost and would presage further suffering. If Nepal is to have a future, it must be a negotiated one - and one which addresses the Nepal's extremes of social injustice. </p> <p>For now, for Nepal's poor, the best chance of escape from this misery and violence is to find work abroad, legally or illegally. Women are trafficked into the sex trade, men recruited into international labour gangs that service the lifestyles of the well-off. The 12 victims of last week's atrocity were poor: cooks and cleaners, recruited by an agency in Kathmandu that told them they were going to Jordan. Once there, they were ordered to Iraq. </p> <p>The Nepalese government has no troops in Iraq and has banned its own citizens from going there. But the ban is gesture politics. The realities of Nepal are what counts. According to recent reports up to 15,000 Nepalis have gone to Iraq, some recruited by agencies in Kathmandu, others through Indian operators in Mumbai. In the final video, one of the men, a US flag pinned to his chest, read out a statement that accused the US of using deception to recruit them. \"We ask anyone who wants to come to Iraq not to be cheated by these high salary (sic) because they are false and America is lying,\" he said. </p> <p>Nepal has no troops in Iraq and the Nepalese government was given no chance to negotiate. The US was at one end of the long chain of lies that brought the men to Iraq, their miserable conditions at home at the other. The men who murdered them picked them not for their connection to the US, but because they were unprotected and their deaths would be a warning to others to stay away. In Nepal, it will probably work. For the hostage-takers, that is enough. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:isabel.hilton@theguardian.com\">isabel.hilton@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Grimly, but fittingly, legislation inspired by a series of rail disasters has been endlessly delayed. A new statute on corporate manslaughter - first suggested after the Southall crash and then accelerated by Hatfield three years later - has been shunted into various Westminster sidings but seemed to have been re-timetabled yesterday after the collapse of attempted prosecutions over the Hatfield crash. <p>The rewritten law would make it easier to stand at a boardroom door and shout: \"Officer, it was them!\" But, while most moral arguments favour a law of corporate killing, the difficulty is giving the pointing finger strength. </p> <p>The MRSA outbreak is a useful test case. Patient infections are clearly not the result of an act of God but of negligence at some level: standards of hygiene have slipped since Hattie Jacques ran NHS wards, and staff do not wash their hands as frequently. If a patient dies from MRSA, grieving relatives might have a case for institutional negligence or, in the newly mooted legal terms, corporate killing. </p> <p>Yet who is to blame? The dirty-fingered nurse or doctor who transferred bugs from one wound to another? The matron who failed to tell them to scrub up, or the administrator who failed to tell the matron? And, given that it was never the intention of staff to spread infection, is it right to criminalise tiredness and disorganisation, or even laziness? </p> <p>Then, if the penalty were financial, we would have a situation in which the state was reducing the money available to a state-funded body. Some campaigners sidestep this difficulty by suggesting that the law should apply only to private companies. There may be some logic in this - it feels worse to be killed by negligence driven by profit than by mistakes made by low-paid public-sector workers - but it seems wrong to indemnify the state and, in an age of public-private crossover, hard to enforce. </p> <p>And, even if such a law were forced through, the corporations would soon re-turf the playing field in their favour. While we hope that their response to negligence legislation would be to improve safety, cynicism and history suggest the first move would be to ratchet up their insurance and protection against damages. </p> <p>Then, in the traditional corporate reaction to the threat of change, they would threaten or enforce higher prices and lower wages or pay rolls, citing increased insurance costs. Soon, huge disclaimer signs would rise outside HQs and branches, and employees and customers would find themselves required to tick little boxes accepting responsibility for their own welfare. </p> <p>As the grieving Hatfield families and others have discovered, trying to pin the blame on a business makes the odds on needles in haystacks look attractive. Corporations are expert at deflection, and it's hard to see how a law could be worded that had an effect other than forcing the bereaved to pay lawyers higher fees for longer while actions congealed in the British and European courts of appeal. </p> <p>It's hinted that the sanctions under a new act would aim less for imprisonment of individuals than for fines and the stigmatisation of a company. But in the areas of medicine and rail, where inattention is most likely to cause death, much of the public is at the mercy of virtual monopoly providers. A stigmatised institution is one you may still have to use. </p> <p>There's also the question of whether the attempt to create an offence of corporate killing is part of an institutional refusal in the present generation to accept risk and death. The phrase \"stuff happens\" - Donald Rumsfeld's version for a rightwing Christian administration of the Vietnam motto \"shit happens\" - is gaining a new currency because David Hare has used it as the title of his play about the Iraq war. </p> <p>As it happens, Hare's last play, The Permanent Way, was about the journey from railway privatisation to train disasters, including Hatfield. It was a brilliant account of how ideology, compromise and inattention in an industry can lead to the funerals of its customers. </p> <p>And yet it is hard to believe that any of the politicians, directors or passengers in the play would have behaved differently simply because a law of corporate killing lay on the statute books. Hare might reasonably have called his railway play Stuff Happens. </p> <p>Corners are cut and backs are turned in business because it has proved to be the only way of maintaining the levels of price that consumers have decided they deserve. A social revolution would be necessary to change these attitudes, and, until it happens, it seems a poor solution to use the law against corporations who are notorious, among many things, for their employment of smart, expensive lawyers. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "When they come to write the history of early 21st century Beijing, it will probably not even merit a footnote, but last Thursday was a big day in the life of Cui Zengxu, the cycling barber. <p>After more than 40 years of clipping, cropping and trimming, the 75-year-old gave a final haircut on one of his prime spots: Jiaokou, the muddy, bumpy, anachronistic dirt-track that serves as the northern border of Chaoyang Park. </p> <p>Next week, that road will cease to exist and the last of his customers in the neighbourhood will have been moved out so that the land can be prepared for the least indigenous of Beijing's Olympic sports: beach volleyball. </p> <p>Jiaokou has always been one of Beijing's least salubrious areas. But now it is a wrecking zone. Streets of debris form the backdrop for Mr Cui's mobile, open-air salon. The few buildings left have \"chai\" (demolish) signs daubed on the walls. A nearby pond has been filled with rubbish. A plaster statue of a woman sits amid a row of smashed houses and gutted karaoke bars. </p> <p>Mr Cui appears to be cutting hair in a wasteland, but it does not seem to faze him. Although it is the last of countless fortnightly visits to the Jiaokou community, he pedals up as usual with a bag full of brushes, razors, clippers and mirrors, unfolds the chair that is his place of work and patiently waits for clients, who pay the equivalent of 20p for a 30-minute trim, regardless of age or style. </p> <p>There is not much time for nostalgia in Beijing, arguably the fastest changing city on earth. From experience, Mr Cui knows it is better simply to move with the times. </p> <p>He has seen fashions come and go. During the insanity of the cultural revolution, customers asked for half of their heads to be shaved. After that traumatic era, people preferred a steady short-back-and-sides. Since China opened up, his clients are more picky, requesting a variety of styles. </p> <p>But Mr Cui appears to have his own ideas. I've never seen any of his customers escape with anything less than a military crop. His last three customers - a small boy, a migrant worker and me - all left with the same style, no matter what request we gave to begin with. </p> <p>\"I know you said you like a bit of a quiff in the front,\" he said. \"But while I was cutting your hair, I realised it didn't look good, so I've done it all the same. It's a big improvement, don't you think?\" </p> <p>It was too late to grumble. In any case, a complaint would not have gone down well. Mr Cui is from a generation that endured the murderous famines of the \"great leap forward\", when much of Jiaokou was still farmland, and the anarchy of the cultural revolution, when this beautiful area was polluted by pharmaceutical plants, paper mills and a shooting range of the People's Liberation Army. </p> <p>Today, it is just a dirty tip as far as most Beijingers are concerned. Taxi drivers would rather endure the thick traffic of the fourth ring road than risk their suspension and their bodywork on the muddy, bumpy road. </p> <p>But all this will change in the next three months. Chaoyang Park is spreading north as part of the city's beautification campaign for the 2008 Olympics. The grey hovels that were home to Mr Cui's clients will be replaced by green parkland, the dusty roads will become a sandy sporting venue. </p> <p>Locals may grumble that they are being moved against their will into soulless high-rise blocks, but Mr Cui has a hairdresser's philosophy. Even if things don't turn out as you like, don't worry: it will grow back again. He is ready to move on. </p> <p>\"I'll find somewhere different to cut hair,\" he says. \"There are always people who need a trim.\"</p>",
  "Only tumbleweed is missing from Shindand, an abandoned Soviet-era military base far inside the deserts of western Afghanistan. Rusting tanks and pillaged jet fighters are scattered across the vast compound, bleaching under the baking sun. <p>Inside one of the deserted offices, an Afghan general and his American counterpart sat eating grapes. They exuded an air of quiet triumph. \"The situation around here is improving day by day,\" said General Aminullah Ptyani, reaching for the fruit bowl. \"The time for war is over.\" Beside him, Lieutenant Colonel Mike Dunn, a US \"mentor\", nodded in agreement. </p> <p>A fortnight ago, they were far less certain. A bloody battle boomed across Shindand. Fighters loyal to the powerful provincial governor, Ismail Khan, were slugging it out with his bitter rival, the warlord Amanullah Khan. As the death toll mounted, the conflict threatened to tip over into a full-scale war - a disastrous development just weeks before the presidential elections on October 9. </p> <p>Then, Gen Aminullah and the newly trained Afghan national army intervened. More than 1,000 troops, accompanied by American advisers and a handful of special forces, landed in Shindand. They seized control of the airstrip, established a 15km (9.3 mile) buffer zone between the belligerents, and imposed peace. </p> <p>Since then, the ANA, bolstered by the Americans, is flexing its muscles in Herat in an effort to erode the influence of one of Afghanistan's most powerful warlords. </p> <p>The intervention is good news for the interim president, Hamid Karzai, who has sought for years to wrest control of Herat province from its wily Tajik overlord, Ismail Khan. Mr Khan, a mujahideen leader who likes to be called \"emir\", has dominated the ancient city for 25 years. But now his grip is looking increasingly slippery. </p> <p>To the surprise of many, Amanullah's forces pushed the governor's militia back to within 18 miles of the city. Shockingly, it appeared as if Herat could fall. The proud emir was forced to accept ANA help to save his city. </p> <p>Now predictions are mounting that the end of his reign is near. \"He looks finished. This is not about military strength any more. It's about political negotiations and face-saving,\" said one western diplomat. </p> <p>Mr Khan is one of Afghanistan's most powerful - and colourful - warlords. His power stems from popular appeal, military might and a firm grip on the purse-strings of the country's most lucrative border crossing. Herat is Afghanistan's gateway to Iran, which, according to a UN official, accounts for 80% of Afghanistan's imports. It also earns Mr Khan customs duties estimated at between $250,000 (\u00a3140,000) and $1.5m a day. </p> <p>Much to the frustration of the cash-strapped national government, only a fraction of the money gets to the treasury. But, unlike other Afghan warlords, Mr Khan has returned at least some of the money to his people. </p> <p>Herat sparkles as a centre of commerce in one of the world's poorest countries. It boasts broad new asphalt roads, public parks, libraries and Afghanistan's only 24-hour electricity supply, sourced in Iran. There are even plans to revive the tourist authority. </p> <p>\"Unlike most of these guys with access to revenue streams, he has done something with it,\" said Victor Parekh of the International Crisis Group. </p> <p>Mr Khan's caliph-like reputation is cemented by his famous weekly \"court\". Every week hundreds of supplicants crowd into an ornately decorated hall in the city centre for a personal audience with the snowy-bearded governor, who dispenses money, advice, divorces and decisions on family disputes. A team of officials mops up the administrative side; armed soldiers guard the door. </p> <p>But last Thursday morning, the governor's desk was empty while he took some advice of his own. Mr Khan was in a back room, meeting 60 tribal leaders summoned from across the province. Afterwards they filed out, towards a plane bound for Kabul. \"We are going to see President Karzai, to tell him that Ismail Khan is our spiritual leader and our hero. We support the transitional government, but only through him,\" said Muhammad Saqzai, who claimed to represent 30,000 families. </p> <p>Mr Khan denies he is against the ropes. During a midnight interview at a richly decorated office, he admitted losing at least 90 soldiers to the fighting, with another 44 missing and presumed dead. He blamed his misfortune on enemies within the government, who, he said, helped coordinate the attacks. \"It was not President Karzai, but members of his cabinet that were involved,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Khan confirmed that he had agreed to take a ministerial position in Kabul after the election. But \"only if there is security\". In a country awash with guns, and under attack from Taliban insurgents, that is a major \"if\". </p> <p>Many city residents support him. Unusually for a warlord, Mr Khan has banned the poppy trade, favouring legitimate commerce instead. And he has encouraged education for women, and now boasts that 150,000 of the city's 400,000 students are girls. </p> <p>\"Ismail Khan is a good ruler. He has provided parks, power, security and services to this city,\" said Yahya, a merchant selling sequin dresses in the shadow of the old city palace. \"Many of us appreciate that.\" </p> <p>But the emir's benevolence has come at a price. There is little political opposition, critics are beaten up, and the free press shut. In the most striking demonstration of Mr Khan's contempt for human rights, his bodyguards publicly beat up a critical journalist at the opening of the city's human rights commission last year. </p> <p>In the old city marketplace, a trader named Abdullah detailed the alleged corruption of Mr Khan's rule. When a stranger sidled alongside to eavesdrop, he abruptly changed the conversation. </p> <p>The election will almost certainly decide Mr Khan's fate. But he has enjoyed charmed escapes from tight spots before. In 1997, he dramatically escaped from a Taliban prison, sprung by sympathetic officials. As his getaway vehicle sped across the desert, it hit a landmine, but he escaped to Iran with just a broken leg. </p> <p>This time, pre-election deal-making could provide a way out. He has concealed his choice for the poll, and denies that the proliferation of posters in Herat for Yunus Qanooni - Mr Karzai's biggest rival - indicated his preference. </p> <p>\"Campaigning has not started,\" he said, preparing for another meeting after his midnight interview. \"So I have not decided yet.\"</p>",

  "It was the murder that prompted retailers to pull the controversial computer game Manhunt from their shelves. <p>But as Warren Leblanc, 18, was given a life sentence yesterday for luring his 14-year-old friend to a park and killing him, Leicester crown court was told the murder was not a re-enactment of the game but the result of gang culture. </p> <p>Leblanc confessed to killing Stefan Pakeerah with a knife and claw hammer, but claimed he had planned only to rob him to repay a \u00a35 debt. The then 17-year-old, from Braunstone Firth, Leicester, had taken Stefan to Stokes Wood Park, where he attacked him on February 26.

She says Leblanc was obsessed with the game. </p> <p>\"To quote from the website that promotes it, it calls it a psychological experience, not a game, and it encourages brutal killing,\" she said. \"If he was obsessed with it, it could well be that the boundaries for him became quite hazy.\" </p> <p>Rockstar Games, the maker of Manhunt, has rejected any link between the game and the killing, saying it is clearly classified as an 18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification. </p> <p>Yesterday, Roderick Price, QC, defending, said his client had, instead, been motivated by fear of a gang to whom he owed a small amount of money. </p> <p>\"The reason he killed Stefan is rooted not in video games, but in fear - in desperation born of fear.\" </p> <p>Mr Price said Leblanc owed \u00a375 to a member of the Crusaders gang. </p> <p>\"Both Stefan and the defendant are victims of a gang culture that creates fear in the minds of young men and, in the case of this defendant, a young man who was not a gang member and who was out of the loop. </p> <p>\"He considers that he was in imminent danger of serious bodily harm, and it is against this background that he committed the offence that he did.\" </p> <p>Judge Michael Stokes, QC, ordered Leblanc to serve a minimum of 13 years in prison, saying he had committed a truly appalling crime, and that what happened was far beyond what was necessary for a robbery. </p> <p>\"You have taken the life of a 14-year-old boy in a most brutal fashion,\" he said. \"One thing is clear - you and you alone were responsible for this prolonged, vicious and murderous attack on someone who thought of you as a friend.\" </p> <p>Outside court, Stefan's father, Patrick, said the game Manhunt had been an \"instruction manual\" for his son's killer. </p> <p>\"It gave him an idea,\" he said. \"It gave him some idea of how to go about what he did. \"It has left an empty void in my life, I don't think any sentence would have been long enough for me.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sean Harrigan has made some powerful enemies. As president of Calpers, the largest public pension fund in the United States, he has become a thorn in the side of corporate America, taking on some of its best-known and biggest egos. </p> <p>Earlier this year the fund locked horns with Michael Eisner, the beleaguered boss of Walt Disney, leading the call for his resignation. Calpers also played a pivotal role in the ousting of former New York Stock Exchange chief Dick Grasso as he became embroiled in a bitter dispute over his eye-popping salary. </p> <p>In April, the fund pressed other investors to back its campaign against Sanford Weill, the boss of Citigroup, the biggest banking firm in the world. Weill, Calpers said, \"should be held accountable\" for the numerous Wall Street scandals in which the bank played a role. With profits returning and the Citigroup share price heading up, few others agreed. He remains chairman. </p> <p>Among other head-on collisions, Calpers has filed a suit against Time Warner alleging fraud, and even withheld votes for the re-election of Warren Buffett to the board of Coca-Cola, inviting the opprobrium of America's favourite investor. The list, a who's who of the US business community, goes on. </p> <p>Calpers, an acronym for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, has a long history of shareholder activism - taking an active role in the companies it invests in instead of the traditional passive approach. It cites studies that show active share ownership improves both performance and share prices in the long term. With $170bn (\u00a395bn) under management, it wields the kind of power that directors take note of, whether they be at the exchange or corporations. In the year to June 30, it earned a return of 16.7%. </p> <p>The fund started to engage company management two decades ago when it embarked on a campaign to rid corporate America of \"poison pills\", the clauses adopted by boards to prevent takeovers. </p> <p>More recently, though, Calpers has redoubled its efforts in response to the unprecedented wave of financial scandals in the US. Amid the accounting woes at the likes of Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and Adelphia, the fraud uncovered at mutual funds and the widespread sleaze at Wall Street's biggest banks, Calpers has emerged as corporate America's self-styled moral compass. </p> <p>\"I think we are probably the most active fund in the US; one of the most active in the world,\" Harrigan says. \"We believe very strongly that first of all it does enhance long-term value of our investments but secondly, if we don't do it, who will? We are the largest in the US and as a result of being the largest I think we have a responsibility.\" </p> <p><strong>Focus list</strong><br> </p> <p>As the firestorm raged last summer over the $188m compensation package paid to Grasso at the New York Stock Exchange, Calpers exercised that responsibility and waded in. Grasso had been resisting intense pressure to quit. Calpers held a press conference demanding that he step down and within 24 hours he was gone. </p> <p>Harrigan is still aghast. \"It was outrageous,\" he says. \"Here you have the largest stock exchange in the world that should set the absolute right example. Then you've got a guy like Dick Grasso who's got this $188m package. I said it as clearly as I could: it was an example of the pig being in the trough and our job was to get him out of the trough.\" </p> <p>The other tangible success for Calpers this year has been Disney. Led by Calpers, shareholders who were frustrated by the poor performance of the entertainment and media group withheld an unprecedented 43% of the vote for Eisner's re-election to the board. Disney, which had stubbornly defended Eisner, reacted swiftly, stripping him of the chairmanship although leaving him as chief executive. </p> <p>Harrigan says Calpers was pleased by the size of the withheld vote but still describes Disney as a work in progress. </p> <p>\"I was disappointed that the board would be naive enough to believe that splitting the role of chairman and chief executive would satisfy our concerns because we think that action will have no impact whatsoever on Disney's performance. Eisner is the problem, and there's only one way to correct that problem.\" </p> <p>The fund's attention more lately has turned to Royal Dutch/Shell, where Calpers is engaged in efforts to reform the board. Like Disney, Shell is on Calpers' annual \"focus list\", which identifies the biggest problem companies. The other two on this year's list are home appliance maker Maytag and engineering firm Emerson Electric. </p> <p>Shell was sent reeling earlier this year by a series of downgrades to its oil and gas reserves that led to the departure of several top executives. Calpers, however, is dissatisfied with the pace of change at the company and the transparency of its review process. It is putting pressure on Shell to follow through with proposals to simplify its complex dual-board structure. The company has not been \"particularly responsive\", Harrigan says. </p> <p>\"We aren't convinced of Shell's commitment to reform. We have some real concerns about Shell's performance but more importantly about its structure. It's hard to even figure out who you need to be talking to at Shell. We will continue to have a dialogue but they have a long way to go.\" </p> <p>As Calpers has pressed harder, though, corporate America has begun to push back. The resistance appears to be part of a wider business retreat from the rules and regulations put in place to improve standards of corporate governance in the wake of the Enron collapse. </p> <p>The Business Roundtable, a powerful coalition of US chief executives, and the national chamber of commerce have both launched bitter attacks on the Californian pension fund, arguing that the corporate governance movement is out of control. \"This is not about good corporate governance,\" the head of the Business Roundtable, John Castellani, recently said. \"This is hysteria being driven by union-dominated pension funds. They are wrapping themselves in the cloak of corporate governance to gain power and influence.\" </p> <p>The Californian Republican party has also gone on the offensive, accusing the Democrat-dominated Calpers board of political grandstanding. Most of the pension funds that have backed Calpers, including New York and New Jersey, are from Democratic states. </p> <p>Harrigan, a blunt-speaking union boss, appears resigned to the criticism. Detractors, he replies, are trying to \"protect the status quo\" by discrediting the fund. \"You have to try and assess the motives of the people who are making those observations,\" he says. \"If someone was to poll the average American on whether they believe executive compensation is totally out of line, recognising it was 40 times the average wage for a production worker in 1980 and 520 times that last year, I think the average American probably lines up with Calpers. </p> <p>\"Then you look at the fraud and what impact that has had on workers and pension funds and what has gone on in corporate boardrooms. What has happened over the past four years has been absolutely despicable and the criticism of Calpers comes predominantly from individuals who have benefited greatly as a result of the excesses and the lack of accountability that have taken place. </p> <p>\"I certainly understand their motivation. While I don't agree with it, I guess if I had enjoyed the sanctimony of the positions that they've enjoyed over the last 60 years I might be inclined to protect the status quo also.\" </p> <p>Critics have seized on Calpers' stance on auditors. The fund last year decided to withhold votes for re-election to the board for any members of audit committees that allowed accounting companies to provide other services, such as tax or management consulting, potentially compromising their independence. </p> <p>A key finding in the Enron and WorldCom scandals was that auditors were simply too much in the thrall of their clients. Calpers' analysis suggested that 29% of fees still come from consulting services. </p> <p>The problem was more pervasive than Calpers realised. It resulted in the fund withholding votes from directors at 90% of the companies it owns shares in, including Buffett at Coke and Steve Jobs at Apple, provoking widespread ridicule. Buffett described the vote as plain \"silly\". The Wall Street Journal said the \"withhold\" against Buffett was taking governance reform to \"absurd new lengths\". </p> <p>Harrigan responds: \"Buffet is a great investor, he really is. Is he a great advocate of proper levels of checks and balances in terms of corporate governance? I don't think that is his strong point. We weren't suggesting those members be removed from the board. We were making a statement about how important we think it is that you draw a bright line between audit and non-audit related services.\" </p> <p>The criticisms appear to have had an effect. Calpers is unlikely to continue the aggressive stance on auditors and will set out a more selective policy in October or November. \"Some people think we did the right thing, some people think we did the wrong thing. I don't know. I think we made a lot of noise. This is the first time we've done it. Maybe what we did was absolutely the right thing to do for the first proxy season. Maybe now we need to look at refining it.\" </p> <p><strong>Overseas targets</strong><br> </p> <p>The fund's next big focus will be executive compensation, an incendiary issue on both sides of the Atlantic. Calpers is planning a separate focus list of the most egregious cases of excessive pay which will be published later this year or early next. </p> <p>Harrigan says Calpers will also focus more efforts on shaking up poorly managed companies overseas, including Britain - it was part of the failed revolt against James Murdoch's accession at BSkyB. Calpers was a founding member in May of the International Forum for Active Shareowners to encourage more cross-border cooperation and holds about 25% of its equities outside the US. </p> <p>Harrigan judges the most important imminent issue for investors in the US to be the so-called access to the proxy. </p> <p>At present, US shareholders have no means of ousting directors. But, under a rule being considered by the securities and exchange commission, shareholders will be able to nominate an alternative for a board position if more than 35% of the vote is withheld from him or her in the previous year. Corporate America and, Harrigan suspects, the Bush administration are lobbying hard against the rule being adopted. </p> <p>Opponents argue it will be a Trojan horse, allowing special interest groups to find a way on to boards, something Harrigan describes as \"bunk\". </p> <p>\"This is huge,\" he says. \"It is the one issue that I believe has the potential of aligning interests of shareholders and management. It has the potential to create an environment in which we don't see the kind of fraud we saw at Enron and WorldCom and has the potential of making sure that executive compensation is reasonable and tied directly to performance. Without question, it is the issue that has the potential for creating the kind of environment that we think needs to be created in the boardrooms of American corporations.\" </p> <p>If it is passed, Eisner at least could face a genuine fight for survival next year. </p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 57<br> <strong>Education:</strong> Economics degree, Whitman College, Washington State<br> <strong>Career:</strong> 30 years' experience in the supermarket sector, including seven years at Safeway Supermarkets; joined Union of Food and Commercial Workers in mid-1970s, specialising in member recruitment, collective bargaining; director of field operations, coordinator of activities relating to 2000 national presidential election, UFCW; international vice president and executive director, UFCW; February 2003, president, Calpers board of administration<br> <strong>Family:</strong> Wife Kathy, children Kathleen and Ryan<br> <strong>Interests:</strong> Golf, sailing</p>",
  "A state supreme court judge has fined the city of New York for contempt after ordering the release of more than 550 protesters who he said had been detained illegally for up to two and a half days. <p>While George Bush was delivering his keynote speech, demonstrators trickled out, complaining of being held in a bus cleaning station beside the Hudson river without access to lawyers. </p> <p>Many of those held in what protesters have branded \"Guant\u00e1namo by the Hudson\", said they were not involved in anti-Bush demonstrations but had been swept up by overzealous police. </p> <p>They included the manager of a theatre who was coming out of a subway station with a friend on their way to celebrate his birthday, and two women who had been shopping. </p> <p>Tobi Starin, a teacher in Rockville, heard from a friend that her daughter, Liz, had been arrested while coming home from work. \"I kept thinking, 'She'll get out any hour now,'\" Ms Starin told the Washington Post. \"But it's 44 hours, and she's still in there.\" </p> <p>Police arrested 1,700 people during the week that was full of protests but devoid of the violence that many had predicted. </p> <p>Late on Wednesday night, Judge John Cataldo said the detentions violated state law. Early on Thursday afternoon he threatened to impose a fine on the city of $1,000 a day for each person kept in custody longer than 24 hours without being arraigned. By late on Thursday he was still not happy with progress. </p> <p>\"We're coming back again until this is settled,\" he told city officials. \"Once again, the order is, release these people.\" </p> <p>City officials say the sheer number of arrests caused a delay in processing. </p> <p>The deputy police commissioner, Paul Browne, blamed the demonstrators for overwhelming the police. \"It's a new, entitled, pampered class of demonstrators, who want to engage in civil disobedience but don't want to be inconvenienced by arrest processing,\" he said. \"There's a lot of reasons for a hold up. If you were in a group this morning, you are going to go through the process very quickly; if you were arrested with 200 people, it's going to take longer.\" </p> <p>Some protesters emerged from the facility holding their fists aloft and claiming victory. Others, who said they had been denied medicine for asthma and epilepsy, sat on blankets in a park across the street and sought attention from doctors who had been organised by activist groups. </p> <p>The doctors said they found several cases of rashes and skin infections, apparently as a result of cuts from overly tight handcuffs that were exposed to chemicals. </p> <p>They were asked to collect samples of clothing to test for exposure to toxic chemicals.</p>",
  "<b>New York Times</b> <br>Editorial, September 3 <p>\"When President George Bush accepted his party's nomination [on Thursday] night, he ... presented himself as the man who could keep America safe in a time of international terrorism.

  "<p>As ever, it's the economy, stupid. The presidential candidates' rhetoric may be primarily about Iraq, but Americans will vote according to their personal financial swingometers. Wall Street has cottoned on. Market moves are determined, day to day, by the latest slivers of information on the US electorate's domestic well-being. </p> <p>Trading in financial markets has become very mannered in recent months. The summer is usually a period of low activity levels. However, prices often fluctuate wildly during the holiday season - thin volumes exaggerating the effect of any news items. This year, though, volatility and volume have been extremely low - apart from at the times of set piece announcements of US economic statistics. </p> <p>As volumes have shrunk and asset prices tracked sideways, each economic release from the authorities has assumed increased importance. Foreign exchange traders, as an example, traditionally view their working weeks and months as determined by the calendar of forthcoming releases. Now trading might as well be suspended between these pinnacles of activity as the economic data currently has such an arm-lock on the FX market. </p> <p>This control has been established in part simply because a presidential election is approaching, but more importantly because both the outcome of that election and the direction of the American economy are in such doubt. As in 2000, a few votes either way (whether correctly or incorrectly counted) could determine the context. So, a few jobs created or lost in America's industrial heartlands could make all the difference. </p> <p>Michael Moore's screen polemic Fahrenheit 9/11 is chilling in many ways. The scene that stands out for me, though, is neither the sea of bloody images of war nor George Bush's gurning, but of military personnel trawling a Hicksville shopping mall car park for potential recruits. Here is the heart of many of America's social and economic problems. Here, also, were floating voters, if only the thought of voting ever crossed their minds. </p> <p>A Republican president may have a core vote of the well-off who trust their leader to protect them from the chronically unemployed and disadvantaged in that Hicksville mall. A Democrat challenger may strive to mobilise the votes of those disadvantaged people. In between there will always be those who feel weighed down by fear of what lies below and - in that classically American way - in thrall to the dream of self-improvement. </p> <p>Weekly jobless claims figures and monthly payroll data provide a numerical snapshot of the hopes and fears of these middle Americans. It is no coincidence that the monthly non-farm payrolls release, the benchmark employment statistic, has recently become by far and away the most important in the financial markets' calendar. </p> <p>This is, of course, a gross oversimplification of electoral dynamics, but it is one that the politicians themselves and their pollsters clearly subscribe to. One problem the candidates have is that neither can really lay a glove on the other on economic issues - largely because there is no black and white in this debate. So much easier to trade blows over war records (macro and individual) where there are at least substantive differences of fact, recollection and stance to dispute. </p> <p>Bush has presided over an adequate economy. It has grown solidly while inflation and interest rates have kept low. Growth has not really been sufficient to create swaths of new jobs so that, while the recovery has not been jobless, it has certainly been joyless. The geopolitical backdrop has not helped; 9/11 threatened recession, which triggered ultra-low interest rates, which in turn provided a stimulus that to industry always felt fragile - too fragile to warrant much job creation. </p> <p>The economic work was largely the Federal Reserve's. The monetary authority did just as good a job for Clinton as for Bush and there is nothing to suggest it would do anything less for John Kerry. President Bush's contribution was his much-criticised tax cuts for America's wealthiest. There is little evidence to suggest that these have alienated the swing voters as much as they have commentators. </p> <p>It seems incredible that there should be so much to play for economically with only two months until polling, but that does indeed appear to be the case. Over the summer the balance of economic news in the US has pointed to cooling growth rates. Consumer (for which read voter) confidence has fallen sharply. But after Labor Day America's economy traditionally fires back up. The economic data released in the final few weeks before polling will reveal just how strong this seasonal effect is this year. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve has one more opportunity to affect the election outcome, meeting to discuss the level of interest rates on September 21. Things are so finely balanced, though, that it is unclear whether the Republicans would prefer a rate rise, indicating a normal recovery, or none, promising continued stimulus. The answer lies in the butterflies of economic insecurity that beat in the gut of America's workforce. Only time will tell us how fast their wings are beating. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Edmond Warner is chief executive of IFX Group </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edmond.warner@theguardian.com\">edmond.warner@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "George W Bush emerged between two gigantic American flags, walked down a runway to the centre of a stage emblazoned with the seal of the presidency. The proscenium behind him resembled a Roman temple, engraved with large gold letters: \"The United States of America.\" <p>The overpowering evidence of his authority did not foster distance between him and the crowd; instead his elevation excited charismatic deference. Standing alone on the image of the American eagle, he was thrust on his podium physically both amid and above the rapturous delegates at the Republican convention. His solitary presence brought him closer to them in fulfilling their dream of leadership - the president as lone ranger. </p> <p>Bush has always benefited from what he calls in another context \"the soft bigotry of low expectations\". The dismissals of him as stupid, crude and impulsive allow the widest play for his well-planned and sophisticated shrewdness. The spoiled son of privilege, who gained admission to Yale as a favour of legacy to his family, sloughed off his military service, was indifferent to the intricacies of international affairs that compelled the career of his father, and a failure in business until salvaged by family friends, has in fact been a diligent student in one crucial area. </p> <p>The field in which he is expert is politics. Assimilating by osmosis its lessons in a political family, he was apprenticed, beginning in his early 20s, to the most talented and slyest southern political consultants who were the innovators of the post-civil rights southern strategy, becoming their equal. Part of his cleverness lies in hiding this true identity. </p> <p>Bush's acceptance speech was intended in part to present the gloss of a \"vision\" of domestic policy. Until this moment, he had avoided laying out any programme beyond his adherence to the social agenda of the religious right on gay marriage, stem cell research and abortion. </p> <p>His tax cuts have fostered a wildly burgeoning deficit that he steadfastly refuses to address for fear of repeating the nightmare of his father's rescinding of his principal promise: \"Read my lips - no new taxes.\" Bush's \"Leave No Child Behind\" education initiative, which was fashioned as the signature programme of his \"compassionate conservatism\", is crushing the schools and desperately unpopular, even in the most conservative states such as Utah. The policy demands adherence to certain standards of performance, but Bush has refused to provide the $27bn in necessary funding. His Medicare programme for prescription drugs for seniors, a partial privatisation, has older voters up in arms. </p> <p>In his speech, Bush seized upon shards of Clintonism about helping workers cope with the impact of globalisation to offer the bleached bones of old Republicanism - privatisation schemes on social security and Medicare. He attached no price tag to these plans that policy experts calculate will cost trillions of dollars and detonate further explosions in the deficit. But this portion of the speech was the tribute Bush had to pay to his blank page on domestic accomplishment, his bow to the many. </p> <p>For him, 9/11 is the casus belli of his presidency. It is the beginning, middle and end of the drama - the moment when the enemy enters and calls forth the hero. Fear and uncertainty demand his absolute conviction. The hero stands tall and defiant, doing whatever it takes. </p> <p>\"Nothing will hold us back,\" Bush said repeatedly. Every action is seen in the light of 9/11. \"Do I forget the lessons of September 11 and take the word of a madman?\" he asked the crowd, referring to Saddam Hussein. \"No!\" \"Or do I take action to defend our country?\" </p> <p>But even this defence of his strategy of pre-emption was not the most revelatory section of his speech. Now Bush described his \"flaws\": some have to \"correct my English\" and sometimes \"I come across as a little too blunt\". Plain-speaking and honest, he is a natural man. \"Some folks look at me,\" he said, \"and see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called 'walking'.\" </p> <p>With this Bush cast himself as the born cowboy. Suddenly the war on terrorism was folded into the myth of the frontier and its stories of captivity and battles with savages. The hero is the rescuer and avenger, an isolate caught in a moral landscape between civilisation and wilderness. In this primal struggle, the savages use cruel methods to terrorise the settlers, even taking hostages. Law and chaos rage in conflict. </p> <p>In the 19th century novels of James Fenimore Cooper, such as the Last of the Mohicans, Hawkeye, the frontier hero, knows the savages and their ways. Part of what makes him a hero is that he is an unassuming natural man, in touch with the primitive, who has lived among them, putting him beyond the rigid hierarchies of the town. Because of his intimate knowledge he can use the methods of the savages against them. </p> <p>In Western iconography, the lineage runs from Hawkeye to Buffalo Bill, from the Lone Ranger to George W Bush. But the danger for the Lone Ranger is that without friends like Tonto he may become General Custer. Instead of achieving a bonanza, he may find himself through rash judgment surrounded at Little Big Horn, or Mesopotamia. For now, though, with \"a certain swagger,\" Bush gets his convention bump. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal is a former senior adviser to Bill Clinton, and Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",

  "<p>When a 19-year-old Jennifer Beals was picked from 4,000 hopefuls to star as the welder-by-day/dancer-by-night in the 1983 smash hit Flashdance, the research wasn't too hard. She took some dance classes, she tried on some legwarmers, that kind of thing. Researching her current role was a much taller order.</p> <p>\"I thought there must be some secret to being a lesbian,\" she says down a crackly phone from her trailer in Vancouver, where she is already filming the second series of The L Word, dubbed \"the lesbian Sex And The City\". \"I thought the secret might be on the internet or something ...\"</p> <p>The secret turned out to revolve around a pair of leather trousers. \"This woman I was working with, she had this really cool pair of leather pants and I wanted them. She said I could have them if I went out with her to some dyke bars and I was like 'sure' ...\"</p> <p>Beals was kind of disappointed though by her big night out. \"We went to this New York club and there were girls on podiums, dancing and stuff, but it wasn't so different from any other place.\"</p> <p>She can't remember the exact name of the club. \"Pussy something? Clit? Labia?\"</p> <p>There are some yelps in the background from the bunch of real-life Ls congregated in my flat where I'm throwing an L Word party, although it isn't like TV version. Everything is glamorous in The L Word, where the gal pals congregate in a bar similar to Central Perk in Friends, and everyone is cute and shiny and drinks skinny lattes and has plenty of money and is not a psychopath, and I want to know where this place is. I tell her that most lesbian gatherings involve women in advanced stages of alcohol poisoning with loo-brush hairdos and flat shoes slipping around on soggy cigarette butts in bars where they think you're trying to be posh if you ask for ice in your drink.</p> <p>\"Well ...\" Beals hesitates. \"I guess it does take place in LA ...\"</p> <p>In many ways, of course, The L Word is a complete disgrace. In the first episode of Queer As Folk you got gay-boy sex within the first five minutes. Here, as well as lots of Ls, you also have lots of Ss (straights) and Bs (bisexuals) and the first show centres on a bi-try, played by Mia Kirshner, spying through the hedge of her LA home on two hot chicks making out in the pool next door (great scene), but then we immediately go into an overly-long sex scene between Kirshner and her boyfriend.</p> <p>Still, dykes are used to men trying to get in on the act. After a while you just ignore them and try and look at the bigger picture. And personally, I don't think The L Word's candy coat matters too much. Pushing lesbianism to the mainstream is all about Trojan horses, ie strategy. Dress up lesbianism in Victorian boots and corsets (see Tipping The Velvet) and you get primetime space on the BBC. Make the chicks in The L Word shave their legs and have some sensitive men hanging around and you can get yourself a second series. Once your horse has slipped through the paddock doors of \"the men upstairs\", ie the TV bods who decide what constitutes contemporary culture, then you can ask why non-airbrushed chicks are unacceptable - and, naturally, that's not only a lesbian issue.</p> <p>Meanwhile, back in my flat, the real-life Ls are baying for blood. \"Ask her if she did it with a woman yet!\" Lauren, the hard-drinking pilot from Ohio, demands. \"Ask her about the off-the-shoulder sweatshirt in Flashdance!\" Alison, the chef from Crystal Palace, slurs.</p> <p>Lesbians like sexy, bolshy underdogs and some of those Flashdance scenes have proved seminal: the dramatic removal of the welding helmet to reveal a frisky mane of hair, the stripper dance involving water poured over a hot sweaty body (copied by J-Lo in her I'm Glad video), the audition scene (the basis for Geri Halliwell's It's Raining Men video) where the feisty Beals dances for her life in front of a row of stern judges - including the repressed lesbian librarian type.</p> <p>Beals is happy to talk about pussy but gets waspish when you mention Flashdance. This slight prissiness comes over in her role as Bette, the hard-nosed, Saab-convertible-driving art dealer trying to be supportive to her long-term girlfriend, who's attempting to get pregnant by turkey baster. But then, Beals obviously thinks hard about things: after the phenomenal success of Flashdance she turned her back on Hollywood and went to Yale to read American literature. Her recent movies - Roger Dodger (2002) and The Anniversary Party (2001) - are independent productions where she plays, respectively, a feisty modern rock chick and an amateur photographer. She asserts that she accepted the The L Word role because \"the show will change the way people look at each other\".</p> <p>Beals, born in Chicago to an Irish-American mother and African-American father, might like playing bolshy characters (she has \"a fantasy about playing Buffy\"), but fundamentally she's a good girl. When asked if she prefers snogging men or women actors she fudges that \"it's not about gender, it's about trusting the other person\". She says, though, that women are more thoughtful in TV bed situations. \"Another woman can be good at hiding bits of your body for the camera. I mean if you've got a bunch of cellulite ...\"</p> <p>She is a bunch of contradictions. She talks about her cellulite yet insists she would never have plastic surgery because \"you rob yourself of the evidence of experience\". Also, anti-materialistic and un-LA though she claims to be (she talks a lot about running round in flip-flops in the 500 miles of \"wilderness\" in her LA desert home and for her recent 40th birthday she went horse-trekking with her second husband Ken through Patagonia), she still insisted on a (very La-La) no-nudity clause in her contract. She reckons her sex scenes are \"so hot\" that you won't even notice she's still clothed.</p> <p>Hot she may be, but the hottest of all is Katherine Moennig, who is utterly convincing as Shane, the tomboy stud muffin hairdresser (although the only out lesbian member of the cast is kd lang's ex, Leisha Hailey, who plays the bisexual journalist). One of my favourite things about The L Word is that its fantasy feel makes you feel relaxed and safe. Here, you can sleep with a guy if you want and not get excommunicated for it; you can have long hair and lipstick if you want; you can be a lesbian who wants to have babies and not be portrayed as a complete dullard.</p> <p>Unadulterated heterosexuality is the thing that looks dull these days and maybe that's why Beals can't resist telling her Shane story. \"I was in an elevator with Ken on the first day of shooting and in walks this amazing, crazy thing ...\" (Her voice has much richer tones than when she was talking about the horse-riding with Ken just now). \"And she puts out her hand and gives me this salutation ... kind of this Elvis vibe. It was so ... unbelievably cool.\" She adds, her voice growing perkier, that for the first two weeks of shooting, Shane made her feel like \"the most uncool person\".</p> <p>The Lesbian Avengers used to have a T-shirt motto that went, \"We Recruit\" and it will be interesting to see how much recruiting The L Word pulls off. That nervous flutter in Beals' voice sounds like a good start.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The L Word, Wed, 10pm, Living</p>",
  "<p>On September 11 2001, one reaction above all others became cliche almost before the twin towers had completed their grotesque descent. It was, people said, like something out of a movie. And they were right. We'd all seen American landmarks demolished before - flying saucers zapping the White House in Independence Day, meteorites knocking lumps out of New York in Armageddon - but this time, the drama on our screens, while scarcely any more believable, was actually happening. A gang of Allah-addled yahoos, armed with implements most of us could find in our kitchen drawers, really had perpetrated an assault on the United States as deadly and traumatic as Pearl Harbour. It was hardly the most pressing concern raised by that awful day, but for a while it seemed that, surely, nobody would ever again make apocalyptic blockbusters of the Independence Day or Armageddon ilk; Arnold Schwarzenegger's Collateral Damage was tactfully iced because the plot involved terrorists. It even appeared vaguely possible that there would be no more nauseating romantic comedies set in New York, hitherto the world capital of nauseating romantic comedies. The John Cusack/Kate Beckinsale bucket-filler Serendipity was hastily edited to excise shots of the World Trade Centre, as were Zoolander and People I Know.</p> <p>We were at war, we were told, and societies at war do not generally entertain themselves by scaring themselves further. People who endured the Blitz did not spend their leisure time watching films about British cities being bombed from the air. Any Sarajevo cinema proprietor who spent the mid-1990s screening films about civilians being slaughtered by genocidal hillbillies would have struggled for custom. Those members of the tinfoil-hat tendency who believe that the world is in imminent danger of invasion by little green men or annihilation by rogue meteorites would not have much appreciated Independence Day or Armageddon. But we are making, and watching, films and television dramas about terrorism and terrorists.</p> <p>Our enthusiastic consumption of these is, surely, an indication that we don't really take the threat they depict any more seriously than we do, say, the threat of being massacred with a chainsaw in Texas. The war on terror, launched three years ago this month by George W Bush in the ruins of downtown Manhattan, has swiftly become a staple of popular entertainment. It is difficult, on balance, not to conclude that we're all rather enjoying it.</p> <p>The Grid, the latest contribution to the genre of post-9/11 drama is, first and foremost, fantastically good television. Set in the near future, its compelling set-up pits a task force of British and American intelligence officers against a cell of Saudi, Egyptian and Chechen terrorists. The dialogue is sharp, with the minimum of the Janet-and-John exposition often inserted into current affairs-based dramas. It offers intriguing nuance, presenting conflicts within the opposing teams (the CIA, FBI and NSC squabble with each other, and with their British counterparts), and within the characters (one of the CIA guys is a Muslim of Arab descent, one of the Islamist terrorists a first-generation US citizen). The performances are terrific, notably Jemma Redgrave as an MI6 officer, as cold and hard as an ice pick, and Silas Carson as an Egyptian doctor-activist torn between urges to save life and take it. There are a couple of startling but plausible plot twists. There are quite a few explosions. Aside from its subscription to the ironclad casting law of transatlantic co-productions - that all Americans look like Julianna Margulies and Dylan McDermott, and most Brits look like unmade beds with tea-stained moustaches - The Grid is great stuff.</p> <p>What The Grid is not, however, is what its press release describes as \"a unique look at the world's gravest threat\". It is barely possible to turn on a television or walk into a cinema without being asked to digest yet another fictional or semi-fictional or info-taining insight into the war on terror, either explicitly (Michael Moore's fatuous rant Fahrenheit 9/11, last week's Channel 4 drama The Hamburg Cell) or implicitly (this week's BBC simulation Crisis Command, bio-terror shocker Smallpox 2002, the Panorama that mocked up reports of terrorist strikes on London, 24, The West Wing, Spooks, David Mamet's recent Spartan, the 2002 film of Tom Clancy's potboiler The Sum Of All Fears, in which Baltimore gets obliterated by a terrorist nuke). This is to say nothing of the dozens of similarly inspired theatrical productions, including Guantanamo: Honour Bound To Defend Freedom, David Hare's Stuff Happens and the National Theatre's (brilliant) remake of Henry V as a Gulf War II drama. We're eating this stuff up with mustard. A distant war, a vague threat, are as intoxicating for the viewing public as they are for the politician who gets to play at statesman, for the journalist who gets to write pompous articles claiming to know any better than anyone else. It makes us all feel like we live in important times, and are therefore ourselves important.</p> <p>The great unsayable truth of the war on terror, demonstrated by this spectacular eruption of post-9/11 entertainment, is that the chance of anything we're watching at the movies or on TV happening in our streets is, while certainly extant, small. Shocking though the tolls of New York, Bali, Madrid and others have been, our chances of being the victim of a terrorist attack are, on a day-to-day basis, approximately the same as our chances of being kicked to death by a llama in a top hat. Apologies if, in between this piece being written and being printed, Oxford Circus tube is choked by sarin, or if anyone in Britain is kicked to death by an unusually well-dressed South American ruminant, but it wouldn't alter the actuarial reality: terrorism is not that big a risk.</p> <p>This might be partly thanks to the work of the heroes of The Grid - the intelligence agencies who, claimed Australian Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock at a conference last month, have foiled more than 100 terrorist attacks since 9/11. However, it's impossible to know how true this is. Mr Ruddock represents a government which, like Britain's, took its country to war on the premise that Iraq possessed a fearsome arsenal of intercontinental megadeath, the fuses of which were perilously close to the glowing end of Saddam Hussein's cigar - as lurid a fiction as anything dreamt up by the makers of 24.</p> <p>It's much more likely, though, that our readiness to be amused by depictions of people plotting to destroy all that we hold dear is due to a general belief that the threat posed by Osama bin Laden's franchise of obscurantist crackpots has been somewhat overstated by our government and media. It is a reasonable conclusion to have reached. Our skies have not rained aeroplanes. British cities have not become re-runs of Beirut in the 1980s, or even of British cities in the 1980s. The much-feared \"Arab street\" has remained an entirely genial thoroughfare upon which the likeliest hazards for the visiting westerner are being roundly trounced at backgammon or overdosing on coffee poured by rug merchants. The victims of terrorism, though each a crime and a tragedy, represent a fraction of the toll claimed by conventional wars, preventable disease, drunk drivers. The fact that programmes like The Grid are being made should cheer us up on two levels. One, that we've got something this good to watch. Two, the very fact that The Grid, and others like it, all designed at least in part to terrify, are being made, and shown, at all. The time to start worrying is when our screens are suddenly filled with reassurances.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Grid, Tue-Thu, 9pm, BBC2</p>",
  "My father, the late Benny Rothman, would have been thrilled that, 72 years after he was jailed for his role in the Kinder mass trespass, \"walkers are ready to claim their right to roam\" (Report, August 31). He saw it as a human right built into our evolutionary design. I still recall his thrill at Mary Leakey's discovery in 1976 of 3.5m-year-old australopithicine fossil footprints - proof that our evolutionary ancestors were ramblers. He also believed that the current legislation was one step in a greater struggle, first to get people out of their cars and walking, and second to reclaim the land.

  "Children make it different. Like the tragedies of Columbine and Dunblane, the terror that stalks the classrooms of besieged Middle School 1 in Beslan, North Ossetia, is uniquely disturbing. <p>Who in these torrid days of random, global violence has not become accustomed, even inured, to the suicide bombings in Iraq or a host of other troublespots? Yet who, anywhere in the world, is not touched, angered or frightened - or all three - by the thought of young kids traumatised by masked killers wearing bomb-belts? </p> <p>When the victims are children, the sort of horror on show in Beslan, real or threatened, represents the adult world's ultimate betrayal of innocence, its final failure to nurture and protect. Here is a shared disgrace, borne of a universal grief. Here is an international crying shame, beseeching an urgent remedy. </p> <p>The Chechen conflict, in which the Ossetian siege is inextricably bound up, has become internationalised in many other ways since it reignited, in its modern incarnation, in the early 1990s. Like Czechoslovakia in a different time, the Caucasian lands of Chechnya, North and South Ossetia, Ingushetia and Dagestan cannot be dismissed as distant countries of which we know little and care less. What happens there matters here. </p> <p>\"Their suffering is our suffering,\" Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, said yesterday. \"The awesome responsibility of President Putin and his government is our responsibility, too.\" </p> <p>The mere fact of non-stop international media coverage makes Beslan school a shared reality around the world. The inescapable fact that the Chechen conflict once again pits Muslim peoples against Christians or plain non-believers, setting \"Islam\" against the \"west\", sounds an only too familiar post-9/11 global echo. </p> <p>Putin pins the blame for the escalating crisis, perhaps the gravest of his presidency, not on home-grown Chechen fighters but, primarily, on an international Islamist conspiracy linked to al-Qaida. </p> <p>The evidence for his contention is thin and often contradictory. But one thing is undoubtedly true. Since plunging recklessly back into Chechnya in 1994, Putin, his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, and the once proud Red Army have caused such untold misery, such rank injustice, such fury and despair that, like the Americans in Iraq, they created a breeding ground and magnet for the religious extremists they struggle to extirpate. </p> <p>In effect, it was Russian generals and their turncoat allies who internationalised a war that should never have begun and which could have been peaceably resolved long ago. For this foolishness, Russia's conscript soldiers still pay a terrible price. </p> <p>The risk of a spreading, regional conflagration grows with every outrage, every unanswered act of blood - and with every broken child. Since the time of the tsars, the mountain tribes of the Caucasus have fought for land, faith and just for the hell of it. In A Hero Of Our Time, novelist Mikhail Lermontov wrote admiringly in 1840 of the bravery of his opponents along Russia's lawless southern flank. </p> <p>But now Caucasian instability threatens ever more broadly. Neighbouring Georgia, home to last November's \"rose revolution\", is no model of stability. And by coincidence, the Beslan siege has forced the postponement of a presidential visit to Turkey, Russia's historic Ottoman rival. Putin wants to build up trade and other links. But primarily, he needs Turkey as a southern bulwark of stability and security in a region sliding dangerously beyond Moscow's control. </p> <p>Ten long years of destructive, on-off conflict, egregious human rights abuses, massive refugee displacements and blatant flouting of international law have also rendered Chechnya a matter of undeniable international concern. Organisations such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the OSCE have kept a brave and faithful tally of the human toll and political cost of Russia's heedless policy. Again and again, campaigners have lobbied western governments to draw a diplomatic line, to sponsor a political process, to honestly recognise Chechnya for what it ever more evidently is - a threat to international peace and security, as defined by the UN. Again and again, those same governments, including Britain's, have mostly preferred to look the other way. </p> <p>When Tony Blair talks of Britain's \"moral responsibility\" in Darfur and Iraq; when he speaks, as most famously in Chicago in 1999, of the criteria for intervention; when he sends troops dashing off to Kabul and Freetown, where in all this is there a thought for Chechnya? Ten years of conflict, tens of thousands dead and no end remotely in sight. </p> <p>When Straw yesterday spoke of the \"expanded range of issues\" on which the UN will now consider the use of outside force under chapter VII - including \"the overthrow of democratically elected government, terrorism, large-scale human rights violations, humanitarian catastrophe (and) refugee crises\" - can he credibly exclude Chechnya which, in truth, arguably qualifies in all categories? </p> <p>Russia has always maintained that the Chechen conflict is an internal matter, to be resolved internally. But now that Putin, by asking for international support, has for the first time effectively invited the security council to consider the issue, western leaders have a clear choice. </p> <p>Britain and others can hide behind the pretence that, as Putin maintains, violence in the Caucasus is just another front in the US-led \"war on terror\" - and close their eyes to causes and remedies. They can give Putin what he wants, which is carte blanche to do whatever he deems necessary. Or they can find the courage to change the habit of the past decade. They can dispense with the sort of mealy-mouthed, turpitudinous shuffling-about indulged in by France's Jacques Chirac and Germany's Gerhard Schr\u00f6der at their recent meeting with Putin. And they can insist instead that in return for active western support, Russia must finally accept the obvious: that Chechnya is a pressing, international problem requiring an agreed, collective, non-violent, international response. </p> <p>Is it so absurd to suggest that EU troops, or even forces organised through Nato, be deployed under a UN peacekeeping mandate? Is it practically impossible to set in train some form of externally mediated peace dialogue, currently absent? </p> <p>Chechnya offers a key test of how, if at all, new, much-discussed post-Iraq rules governing future humanitarian and security interventions can be made to work. Certainly Chechnya is a devilish hard case to crack. Certainly it would be a fraught undertaking. But it is surely worth it - if only for the sake of the children. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.tisdall@theguardian.com\">s.tisdall@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "It is etched on every face in the small town of Beslan. That helpless, gut-churning, flash of panic that seizes every parent when they turn around and suddenly their child is not there. Why here? Why now? Why my child? They cannot feed their children. They cannot water them. They can only endure the agony of waiting another day. To any Russian, already inured to a culture of catastrophe, the protracted scene of anguish outside Middle School 1 is horribly familiar. It has been the story of the last decade of no-holds barred conflict in Chechnya. The same hostage drama has been enacted inside a hospital in southern Russia, a theatre in Moscow and an entire village in Dagestan. Each time, a mass hostage-taking has only had one of two outcomes. National humiliation as the Chechen hostage-takers are set free to strike again another day. Or national trauma as Russia's crack Alpha special forces blow their way inside. Every Russian who has been held captive knows that to be liberated by Moscow's special forces can be as fatal as to be blown up by their captors. Vladimir Putin, a man who has built his reputation on being the hard man of the Kremlin, can afford neither outcome. <p>But two factors make this hostage taking different. Most are children, some only babies, some of whom are now out; second their parents are angry, anguished and armed. They come from a tiny Caucasian state called North Ossetia. It is here that Russia's biggest military base in the region is located in the garrison town of Mozdok. This is a largely Christian Orthodox and traditionally pro-Russian enclave, in the patch-work quilt of states which stretch from the Caspian to the Black Sea. Almost all these states have known war or armed incursions in their recent history. The North Ossetians are no stranger to war. They were involved in a bitter struggle with their Muslim Ingush neighbours 13 years ago and Russian Orthodox villagers in South Ossetia are in an armed stand-off with their Georgian neighbours. As the Chechen conflict has dragged on, the Ingush have only grown closer to their Chechen cousins, thousands of whom have eeked out a miserable existence as refugees in Ingushetia in the last decade of non-stop war. To incur the fury of North Ossetian parents by risking the lives of their young children, is not simply to inflame the feeling of a pro-Russian population which houses one of their most important military bases in the volatile North Caucasus. It is to risk retaliation by the North Ossetians on their Muslim neighbours. The delicate patchwork of multi-ethnic statelets on Russia's sensitive southern flank could rapidly unravel. </p> <p>Mr Putin has been cautious, pledging that his main task was to save the life of his hostages and getting his officials to put the word out that they had no plans to storm the school. But the same promises were made right up until the end of the Dubrovka theatre siege in Moscow two years ago, when 129 civilians died as a result of inhaling the knock-out gas used to disable the hostage-takers. If Chechen suicide-bombers start shooting their adult hostages, assault forces could soon be panicked into storming the building. Mr Putin has to weigh each decision he takes in the coming hours or days, in the light of what it will do for his strategy in ending the Chechen conflict. He knows that it has defied every military solution. It will not be solved by imposing ruthless placemen, or by splintering the rebel movement. A way out could be sought by opening channels to independent Chechen opposition figures and negotiating a ceasefire. It is alas only in major armed crises that peaceful strategies for ending the Chechen conflict come to the fore. But the cost is paid for, as ever, in the lives of ordinary folk, like the poor people of Beslan.</p>",

  "'Wow!\" exclaimed my grandson, \"You've got one of those. Cool!\" What I have is a turntable that plays vinyl records, stacked, along with the tape deck, CD and radio player, that make up my 12-year-old sound system. He is impressed. How does it work? I reveal the wonders of needle, grooved tracks and two sides of a recording to someone for whom all this is completely new. And cool - as is the collection of vinyl recordings in their cardboard covers, fraying at the corners. <p>This turntable plays not only at 33rpm but also 45 for my collection of seven-inch singles, wonderful songs from Peggy Lee, Edith Piaf and Kiri singing Gershwin. I'm only sad to have mislaid that small plastic disc for those seven-inch records that, oddly, had a two-inch hole in the centre. That means much of my Bob Dylan and the original music from The Magic Roundabout goes unplayed. Sad. </p> <p>It's even sadder the next day, when the man from Bang and Olufsen comes to check it all out. He has an entirely different take from my grandson: \"Oh, goodness, you still have one of those.\" (He, of course, is in the business of selling me a hugely expensive modern version.) He tells me it is now impossible to buy replacement needles, and that, when the company announced, years ago, that they would be discontinuing them, the price shot up amid the general scramble to stock up quickly before supplies ran out. Since I was unaware of all this, I am left with my single, cherished needle. </p> <p>We were taught about built-in obsolescence at school. It was the way economies were structured, so that technical innovation could make its way in the marketplace, drive out the old and decrepit goods that people clung to in their ignorance, and thus keep the wheels of productivity, with all its hangers-on of marketing, advertising and such, booming. But the fact is that new goods aren't always improved goods. I'm told that vinyl recordings are now valued and collected once again. I could, at moments of redecorating over the decades, so easily have chucked all mine away. How thankful I am that I didn't. And I treat that remaining needle with particular care. Now the word is that the CD is over. Not in my home it isn't. Beware people proclaiming new and improved ways of doing what was perfectly satisfactory already. They are usually trying to sell you something you don't need. </p> <p>My kitchen is another treasure trove of the supposedly out of date, including an old egg whisk, tatty and stained - the sort of thing a kitchen-themed pub would have on the wall - and the classic Victorian lemon squeezer. I defy any designer - and that includes Philippe Starck - to design a better way of getting juice out of a lemon than the old-fashioned glass dish and its ridged cone. Sometimes the best design comes first. So what shall I be wearing to this week's opening of the first Jean Muir shop? Will it be the two-year-old trousers and top, or the 15-year-old little blue dress? Neither will look out of fashion. Timeless elegance remains just that. It disproves the fashionistas' advice that says if you haven't worn it for a year, throw it out. I say, keep hold and you won't be sorry. </p> <p>Taking the issue beyond the trivia of my own life, I think it's time built-in obsolescence was rethought. With global problems of ecology and disparate wealth now so glaring, we need to hold on longer to what we have. Why throw away perfectly good and functioning possessions simply because the frenetic world of consumerism pressures you to do so? If every household held on to its white goods one year longer, the landfill problem would ease. If people delayed updating their car we might start to slow down the western world's accelerating drive to consume. Given that such decisions would save us money, we could then afford to buy better quality goods next time, which in turn would last longer. </p> <p>The rise of the car-boot sale, the trade in secondhand clothes, the flourishing of shops such as Curtain Exchange and Oxfam bear witness to the abundance of things discarded long before their use is ended. I know networks of families who regularly swap their children's clothes as they are outgrown by one and become just right for another. My mother, who would never buy antiques because \"you don't know where they've been\" - would not approve. But her thinking has gone, along with her generation. Now we can swap and hand-down, buy secondhand and used, without that furtive feeling of doing something not quite nice. Which reminds me: where did I put those Biba boots? My daughter might be interested.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:joan.bakewell@virgin.net\">joan.bakewell@virgin.net</a></p>",
  "<p>\"Gene Hackman was a good sheriff. OK, a little heavy-handed, but he doesn't deserve a gutful of blood. Or Clint Eastwood looming over him with a gun, ready to unload the other barrel.\" Howe Gelb, the singer-songwriter behind Giant Sand, is talking about the film Unforgiven. Eastwood is one of his heroes; so is Thelonious Monk. \"But as Clint says,\" - Gelb narrows his eyes and spits through his teeth - \"'Deserve's got nothing to do with it.'\" He slurps the top half-inch of ice out of his glass (\"Mojito: ice, rum, fresh mint, the perfect summer drink\") and raises an eyebrow. </p> <p>The moral of the story is pretty clear. What's less clear is if Gelb is on the side of the tormented gunman or the decent guy who has done the best job he could and is bleeding to death. Probably both. \"There's a bullet out there for each one of us,\" Gelb smiles. Right on cue the speaker in the hotel bar, previously silent, starts blaring out, in all its cheery horror, Let the Sunshine In. </p> <p>Conversation turns to gravity, manic mood-swings, Mott the Hoople, President Clinton, and peyote (this last one a poignant tale involving a banjo, an older woman, a van festooned with Christmas lights, Memphis, a chemically altered McDonald's chocolate milkshake, Furry Lewis and A Star Is Born). </p> <p>In fine Howe Gelb fashion, none of this has a jot to do with the record he's ostensibly in London to promote, which is It's All Over the Map, the new album of alt-country band Giant Sand. As opposed to the solo Gelb album, which Giant Sand's website is currently plugging; or the piano album Gelb released just a few months back; or the Band of Blacky Ranchette album Gelb recorded and released shortly before that; or the gospel choir album - \"not religious songs or God songs, just the spirit of the spirit, the overwhelming sound of the human voice\" - that he has just finished recording in Ottawa and which is ready for release at any time (though under what name it will appear is still undecided). </p> <p>Gelb's discography is of a length and breadth that would have all but the most committed fan whining quietly. Fortunately, Gelb/Giant Sand fans are committed - and the website has an offer: buy three albums and get one free. Not the usual approach to the music business, but then Gelb's take on both music and business has always been quixotic: decidedly tilted and unswervingly idealistic. The records he makes, in whatever incarnation and with whatever musicians, are equal parts dazzling, intriguing, beautiful, maddening, musical and perverse. V2, the major label that signed Giant Sand in 1996, employed two different words, however: \"Too indie\". The label dropped the band before releasing so much as one album. </p> <p>\"They said that the album we gave them [Chore of Enchantment] wasn't commercial. But there are enough people out there doing 'commercial' far better than I ever could, so why would they want us for that? Then four years later, a song from that album was used in a Coke ad, so suddenly it's so commercial it is a commercial.\" Gelb shakes his head in amazement. Particularly since the song the advertisers used, Shiver, was the first one he wrote after the death by brain cancer in 1997 of his best friend and former bandmate Rainer Ptacek - \"recorded, in fact, in the same studio that I'd been recording with Rainer in a few days before\". </p> <p>Though he denies any involvement in getting the ad, Gelb admits it was a \"blessing in disguise\". The band's brief major label experience had left him \"completely broke - because when you're on a major you can't do anything else, you can't record or put anything out\". On a positive note, it did give him the impetus to form his own record label, Ow Om. Among its releases, which are sold via the website, are any Gelb, Giant Sand and associated albums that Thrill Jockey (the US indie they normally go through) choose to pass on, official bootlegs, the odd \"cool\" unsigned band Gelb and associates like, or friends lacking a US record deal. </p> <p>Gelb, who has just slotted some sessions with Grandaddy into his busy schedule, is always collaborating with someone on something. He says it's because he likes \"nothing better than to be just another player in a band\". An \"extremely reluctant front-person\", he rhapsodises about how much more agreeable it was being \"just the keyboard player\" in his first band, back in 1978. Following a move from Pennsylvania, where Gelb was born and raised, to Tucson, Arizona, where he still lives, Gelb formed a band with Ptacek in 1979. \"He was the main guy. When he left, we had to divide up the chores and this is what I got. That took some getting used to.\" </p> <p>Gelb's way of dealing with it was to treat Giant Sand (not to be confused with his 1970s electro-rock band Giant Sandworms) as a loose, uncompetitive, mutually supportive musical collective, a place for friends to hang out and play. \"I just liked the idea of having this kind of removed world, this brotherhood - the idea of a band being something more than a front person or dealing with the throes of fame. Because survival is better than success. It hones the instinct.\" </p> <p>For almost two decades, his system seemed to work. But in recent years - in fact since Ptacek's death from brain cancer in 1997 - cracks started to appear in a corner of Giant Sand, and a more competitive, success-oriented spirit started to seep in. This corner was occupied by Giant Sand rhythm section John Convertino and Joey Burns. Or to be precise, ex-rhythm section: they do not appear on It's All Over the Map. </p> <p>Like Gelb, Burns and Convertino also engaged in numerous outside projects, but it was one side-band in particular - Calexico, now more widely known than Giant Sand - that caused the rift. Not because of its success, Gelb suggests, but because the ambition and competitiveness that got Calexico there are antithetical to his concept of what a band should be. </p> <p>\"There was a time a few years ago where the affiliations with Calexico actually began to work against Giant Sand and eat away at what the band was. It was really bizarre - we had people associated only with their label, their agency, people who had no interest in Giant Sand, only Calexico ... \" The sentence drifts off. \"A lot of people confuse Giant Sand with John and Joe, and maybe I'm the only guy on the planet that doesn't know those two guys as being joined at the hip. I met John years before I met Joe and then found Joe and brought him in and then things developed and then I dragged them both back to Tucson where they tripped on to the sound that became celebrated ... I really love those guys a lot, and they were great days, so the separation I think may be felt more by me than them. But, for whatever reason, it was time to let things go, time to reinvent, recognise when the amount of toxin is too great, exorcise the demons and get rid of them and celebrate the time you had. It's all evolution.\" </p> <p>Which, Gelb says, brings us to It's All Over the Map. Like his last solo album, and as the title suggests, it was made in various locations across the globe - in particular, Denmark, where Gelb's wife Sofie is from, and where the couple and their children spend the summer. Sofie sings backing vocals on the album, Howe's daughter from his first marriage, Indiosa, sings lead on a Sex Pistols cover (Anarchy in the UK), and guest musicians include Vic Chesnutt, John Parish and Scout Niblett. </p> <p>\"This record,\" says Gelb, \"makes the point of the new membership drive for the third decade. The Chore of Enchantment record was a bit heavy - Rainer had just died, and the boys began to disappear, the inner circle crumble; that was my mid-life soggy saga and I can hear it in the record, when I dare listen to it. Cover Magazine, the next Giant Sand record, was just a party to say goodbye; it didn't start out as a cover record, but none of the new songs trusted the crinkled line-up then. Then in the middle of the tour for my solo album I started writing a bunch of songs and I realised, this band is becoming what Giant Sand ever was. And there you have it.\" He smiles. \"Actual fun is being had again.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>It's All Over the Map is out on Thrill Jockey on September 13</p>",
  "President Jacques Chirac, and his ambitious young rival, the finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, have signed an unlikely ceasefire in their struggle for control of the French right. Most observers agreed yesterday, however, that the truce was temporary. <p>The Elys\u00e9e Palace announced late on Wednesday that, after a cordial two-hour meeting, Mr Chirac had agreed to support Mr Sarkozy's bid for the leadership of the president's ruling UMP party. The minister, the most popular politician in France, is thought likely to win by a landslide. </p> <p>As part of the carefully brokered compromise, Mr Sarkozy will surrender his cabinet portfolio after the UMP elections in November - an arrangement in keeping with Mr Chirac's ban on anyone combining the posts of government minister and party chief, but which will allow Mr Sarkozy to present an upbeat 2005 budget later this month. </p> <p>The agreement between the old lion of the French right and the young pretender, who has made no secret of his intention to take over at the Elys\u00e9e as early as the 2007 elections, was widely interpreted as a victory for Mr Sarkozy. </p> <p>\"Sarkozy has had the immense satisfaction of seeing his candidacy for the UMP announced and approved by the very person who has tried for so long to prevent it,\" said Herve Gettegno, a political analyst at Le Monde. </p> <p>\"Plus, if Sarkozy wins, which seems more or less certain, he will be taking control of a political party that was founded by and for his principal rivals. This whole affair shows Chirac's realisation that, for the moment at least, Sarkozy is unstoppable.\" </p> <p>Mr Chirac has a deep-seated dislike of Mr Sarkozy that dates back to the latter's fling with the president's daughter, and his decision to back a rival candidate in the 1995 presidential elections. </p> <p>But Mr Chirac knows that the media-savvy Mr Sarkozy, who was France's highly successful interior minister from 2002 to 2004, is the UMP's greatest electoral asset, and that any attempt to sideline him would be punished in the polls. </p> <p>After heavy defeats in regional and European elections this spring, the president and his centre-right UMP had to avert a damaging leadership battle to replace the party leader, Alain Jupp\u00e9, a longstanding and influential Chirac ally who quit the post last month to prepare his appeal against a corruption conviction. </p> <p>In France, leadership of a major party machine is considered vital for any serious tilt at the presidency. But the pro-Chirac camp within the UMP has been unable to come up with a credible alternative candidate for the party leadership. </p> <p>None of those initially canvassed - including the prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the health minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, and the social affairs minister, Jean-Louis Borloo - were thought likely to capture more than 30% of the party's vote, and none were eager to court near-certain defeat by Mr Sarkozy. </p> <p>Mr Sarkozy's aides said yesterday he would formally announce his candidacy at a UMP rally in the Alpine resort of Avoriaz this weekend. </p> <p>But there is uncertainty over Mr Chirac's longer-term plans. Most observers believe it unlikely that, having reluctantly endorsed Mr Sarkozy's candidacy for the party leadership, the president, 71, will also encourage his 49-year-old rival to seek the right's presidential nomination in 2007. </p> <p>\"It seems more likely that Chirac is grooming a successor of his choice and will count on Sarkozy's absence from government to dent his popularity between now and the presidential campaign,\" said one commentator, Alain Duhamel. </p> <p>Most analysts predict the aristocratic Dominique de Villepin, formerly France's foreign minister and now interior minister, will get the Elys\u00e9e's nod, possibly through a promotion to prime minister next year.</p>",
  "The senior representative in Sicily of Silvio Berlusconi's rightwing coalition has been charged with aiding and abetting the mafia. <p>A two-year investigation concluded that the island's governor, Salvatore Cuffaro, passed on secret information he knew would be of vital interest to an alleged Cosa Nostra don. </p> <p>Mr Cuffaro has denied the charges and his party said it was standing by him. </p> <p>A spokesman in Sicily for the party, the Union of Centre Democrats (UDC), said the governor had passed up an opportunity to acquire immunity by declining to stand as a candidate in this year's European assembly elections. </p> <p>Italy's biggest opposition group, the Democratic Left, said the governor should resign. </p> <p>The UDC is the third biggest of the four main parties in Mr Berlusconi's governing coalition. A leading member, Rocco Buttiglione, was named in July by Mr Berlusconi as Italy's new EU commissioner. </p> <p>Last month, the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, made Mr Buttiglione responsible for security, justice and freedom. </p> <p>The call for Mr Cuffaro's indictment emerged from an inquiry set up to trace the origin of leaks during an inquiry into a local doctor, Giuseppe Guttadauro, who is accused of being the boss of Cosa Nostra in its Palermo stronghold. </p> <p>Much of the evidence was gathered by police who listened to conversations at his home before he became aware that they were eavesdropping on him. The investigators concluded that Dr Guttadauro learned that his home was being \"bugged\" from another doctor. The colleague alleged that he, in turn, had been tipped off by Mr Cuffaro. </p> <p>Court papers show that before Dr Guttadauro discovered the eavesdropping, he was recorded apparently describing how the mafia had funded Mr Cuffaro's 2001 election campaign. According to a transcript, he told his brother-in-law that Mr Cuffaro was handed packages of cash \"in the least elegant, but most tangible way possible\".</p>",
  "The African National Congress has cemented its dominance of South African politics by recruiting local councillors from other parties under controversial legislation facilitating switches in allegiance. <p>The ANC seized control of important municipalities this week when dozens of councillors defected from the New National party, the heir to the movement that built apartheid but has now collapsed. </p> <p>The ANC holds more than two thirds of the seats in the national assembly, controls all 10 provincial assemblies, and has now tightened its grip on local government. </p> <p>Cape Town metropolitian council was one of those that fell to the ANC on Monday at the start of a 15-day period in which councillors can change parties without resigning and fighting byelections. </p> <p>The main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, consented to the constitutional amendment after calculating that it would also benefit. </p> <p>Most of the 100 councillors who are expected to switch are leaving the NNP. The party has withered, despite rebranding itself as multiracial. Its leaders threw in the towel last month and urged members to join the ANC. </p> <p>A big minority joined opposition parties, but most went to the ANC, bolstering what critics say is an unhealthy imbalance in a decade-old democracy.</p>",
  "Brian Whitaker raises the argument that non-violence can bring justice to the Palestinians (Israel bombings, September 1). At every checkpoint, in every town centre, in every neighbourhood, Palestinians use non-violence. When Palestinians are ordered by Israeli soldiers to strip naked, endure torture, participate in dehumanising rituals, they do not fight back; they refuse to have their spirits broken or to comply with the inhuman demands of the occupiers. <p>The problem of apartheid was not solved using purely non-violent resistance. Mahatma Gandhi resisted an empire in its twilight. But Israel is supported almost unconditionally by the only remaining superpower. Ariel Sharon believes in a vision of Eretz Israel - a greater Israel that includes the West Bank. He has shown himself more than willing to use violence to achieve this vision.

  "Soaking in a tub of piping-hot spring water is as much a part of Japanese life as karaoke, but several unscrupulous innkeepers in some of the country's best-known spa resorts are in hot water of their own after they admitted filling their baths from the hot tap. <p>At least seven of the 55 inns and public bath houses in the spa resort of Ikaho, about 80 miles north of Tokyo, said recently they had filled baths with tap water after mineral-rich springs started to run dry. Their admission prompted 4,000 cancellations from appalled tourists. </p> <p>Ikaho, a popular retreat for writers and artists, is known for its iron-rich waters, which were first piped to the surface 400 years ago. Tens of thousands of people visit the town every year seeking the purported therapeutic effects of the reddish-brown water. </p> <p>Several inns in the spa resort of Shirahone said they had added bath salts to give the waters their trademark milky-white hue. The waters, which are said to have medicinal qualities, reportedly started to lose their natural colour 10 years ago. </p> <p>After that, the trickle of embarrassing revelations became a deluge. Other inns owned up to misleading guests, angering Japan's millions of hot-spring enthusiasts and prompting calls for tighter regulations. </p> <p>The innkeepers have not broken any laws, however. Under a 1948 law, anyone who discovers a source of water 25C or hotter can open a bath house. They are required to register the bathing facilities when they open, but do not have to renew their licence. When the natural spring water runs dry, there is nothing, legally, to stop them using tap water. </p> <p>The lengths to which some will go to attract visitors reflects an urgent need to keep the waters flowing as the Japanese show no sign of abandoning the centuries-old tradition of stripping off and lowering themselves into piping hot water, often several times a day. </p> <p>There are now more than 22,000 registered inns and bath houses at 3,000 resorts across the country, almost double the number of 40 years ago. </p> <p>Yet according to Japan's Fair Trade Commission, only about a third of the country's hot springs use pure, undiluted spring water from natural sources. </p> <p>The industry was rocked two years ago when seven people died after contracting legionnaires' disease at a hot-spring resort. </p> <p>Another inn caused a public outcry when it refused to allow former leprosy patients to use its baths, fearing they would upset other guests. And the increasing use of chlorine has some bathers worried that a soak may cause skin complaints, not soothe them. </p> <p>The environment ministry, however, plans to question every spa operator in the country in an effort to discover the extent of the deception. </p> <p>The inns, though, are likely to survive the inquest: a newspaper poll published this week found that visitors were more concerned about the quality of the food on offer than the water.</p>",
  "At least 200 hostages were killed and over 700 injured as Russian troops today stormed the school seized by militants two days ago. <p>95 victims had been identified but health officials told the official Russian Interfax news agency that more than 200 people had been killed by fire from militants or died from their wounds as the hostage crisis in the North Ossetian town of Beslan, southern Russia moved towards a chaotic, bloody end. </p> <p>Russian officials said they had not planned to storm the building, but had gone in after an explosion was heard. One unconfirmed report suggested that a female militant wearing a suicide bomb belt had accidentally blown herself up, prompting the raid. </p> <p>Thirteen of the 17 male and female militants earlier shot their way out of the school, where they had held hundreds of children and adults hostage since Wednesday. Troops, backed by tanks, were pursuing them. </p> <p>An official tonight told the Interfax news agency that a total of 27 hostage-takers had been killed.</p> <p>The raid began at just after 10:00 BST, when dozens of young women and children, many wearing only underwear, were seen running from the school, some bleeding, after two loud explosions and heavy bursts of gunfire.</p> <p>Some of the militants were said to be holed up in a house in the area as others attempted to blend in with released hostages and crowds of locals, Itar-Tass said. Russian authorities claimed to have control of the school, but gunfire continued to ring out from both inside and outside.</p> <p>The sequence of events was unclear, with early reports suggesting the militants had agreed to allow Russian forces to retrieve the bodies of between 10 and 20 hostages who had been killed. A local politician, Azamat Kadykov, had told hostages' relatives that 20 men had been executed. </p> <p>Emergency personnel went in to get the bodies, and the militants began setting off bombs and opening fire on people around the school, Itar-Tass reported.</p> <p>Around 30 women and children broke out of the building, some bloodied and screaming, and commandos then launched the assault. Interfax said militants fired at children who ran from the building, and Itar-Tass reported that Russian commandos had blown a hole in the wall of the school in an attempt to help the hostages escape. </p> <p>Police said the hostage-takers had split into three groups during the storming. Some of the militants remained in the school, others apparently sought to escape into the town, and others tried to blend in with the hostages.</p> <p>An ITV cameraman said he had seen \"a large number of corpses lying on the smouldering floor\" of the school's gymnasium, according to the station's reporter, Julian Manyon. Manyon said it appeared explosive charges laid by the hostage-takers had been detonated, setting fire to the roof and bringing part of it down.</p> <p>The Guardian correspondent Nick Paton Walsh, speaking from the scene, said: \"It's very clear from the blood that we saw on the children who came out of the building that there have been casualties.\"</p> <p>Young children were seen gulping water after their escape, suggesting they had had little to drink during their ordeal. The hostage-takers had refused earlier offers for food and drink to be sent into the school.</p> <p>Women who escaping the building were seen fainting, while others, covered in blood, were carried away on stretchers. Sky News said there were around 25 ambulances at the scene. </p> <p>The militants, some with explosives strapped to their bodies, had reportedly threatened to blow up the building if security forces attempted to storm it.</p> <p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had said everything possible would be done to end the \"horrible\" crisis and save the lives of the children. Mr Putin was expected to address the Russian people later tonight. </p> <p>A regional leader today said that the militants had demanded that Russian troops pull out of Chechnya, in what was the first official information firmly linking the attack to the Chechen conflict. </p> <p>Alexander Dzasokhov, the president of the republic of North Ossetia, which borders Chechnya, made the statement after a meeting relatives of hostages before troops stormed the school.</p> <p>Officials yesterday said that 354 adults and children were being held by the 17 armed men and women who stormed the school on Wednesday. However, a report today, quoting a female teacher who was one of the 31 hostages released yesterday, said there were \"at least 1,500 hostages\".</p>",
  "The pleasure of interviewing the Hong Kong film star Jackie Chan begins before you meet him. It is provided by the wide-eyed reaction of your children when you tell them you are going to interview him. At the age of 50 Chan enjoys apopularity that straddles continents and generations. Children see him as a cartoon character, while film buffs remember that he used to be a stuntman in Bruce Lee movies and was one of the architects of the renaissance of Hong Kong action films after Lee's death. Ordinary filmgoers will have seen him cavorting on top of skyscrapers, leaping from lorry to lorry at breakneck speed and shaking off hordes of killers hot on his heels in one of the Hollywood productions that have confirmed his world-star status over the past seven years. <p>Chan was recently in Paris promoting the remake of Jules Verne's classic Around the World in 80 Days in which he appears as Passepartout, the part that in the 1956 version was played by the Mexican actor Cantinflas, whose image in Latin-America was similar to Chan's today in the far east. </p> <p>Chan saw the earlier film of the novel when he was still a boy learning singing, acrobatics, dance and martial arts at the China Drama Academy. Born of parents who were so poor that they thought of having him adopted, he spent the rest of his childhood at that school, after his family moved to Australia. Today Chan is a firm believer in family entertainment: \"I wanted to make a movie for families all over the world - not just for the British or the Americans, but for everyone. One shouldn't be afraid of travelling. One should show children the world.\" </p> <p>The world as seen in this version of Around the World in 80 Days is not quite the same as Verne's. In the film Berlin plays the role Paris did in the book. But when the Chinese countryside is shown, it is genuine: \"I'll always be Chinese,\" Chan says with a heavy accent. \"Directors know very well they can't get me to play an ABC [American-born Chinese].\" This explains the presence, in the middle of this very free adaptation of Verne's novel, of a martial arts mini-movie. </p> <p>As he has done ever since becoming a fully integrated Hollywood figure, Chan took control of that episode: \"I chose the village, the actors and the extras, and I coordinated the fight scenes.\" He got Sammo Hung, a fellow student at the China Drama Academy, to play Wong Fei-hung, a character taken from the great classics of Hong Kong cinema who pops up in a Verne story. Chan's co-producers of the movie had little choice but to agree. </p> <p>It took Chan two tries before he became successful in Hollywood. He was already a huge star in Asia when he had his first go in the 1980s: \"It didn't work, because the older directors wouldn't listen to me. To be quite frank, they were directing the movie, but they had no idea about how to shoot action sequences. Now everyone has learnt the Hong Kong style, but at the time no one listened to me. So I said: 'Goodbye Hollywood.' \" </p> <p>\"Then a new generation came along, people such as Brett Ratner [director of Rush Hour ] and Frank Coraci [ Around the World in 80 Days ], who never say 'I know everything, there's nothing you can teach me'.\" </p> <p>Chan has considerable experience of film-making. His theatrical training enabled him to get a job at the Hong Kong studios in their heyday. His extraordinary physical abilities made him a natural stuntman. He appeared in two Lee movies, Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon . \"I was a poor stuntman. I earned less than $10 a day. When I saw Lee, I said to myself that perhaps I could be like him one day.\" </p> <p>It was not until 1978 and Drunken Master , directed by Woo Ping-yuen (who coordinated the fight scenes of Kill Bill ), that Chan became a screen icon - as someone who combined slapstick with violence, elegance with ridicule. He was likened to the great comic stuntmen of silent cinema, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton. </p> <p>He has broken most of the bones in his body, but that has not made him any more cautious: \"Safety comes first in Hollywood, but after so many years in the business I'm trusted by the insurance companies - they know I'm crazy, but not stupid.\" </p> <p>The toll taken by his fractures has now been compounded by the passing years: \"I choreograph my fights. I know how high I can jump. I know I can't kick in the air the way I used to 20 years ago. So when, for example, there's a table between me and my opponent, instead of leaping over it I pause for a moment, then shove the table forwards. But I'm still pretty nifty.\" </p> <p>Chan is a nifty businessman too. He has launched two lines of clothes and set up a film company, Jackie Chan Empire. He has just shot New Police Story , a sequel to one of his biggest successes, Police Story , and produced a comedy in Singapore. Chan would now like to go over to more dramatic roles: \"I talked to the director Ang Lee about that, but at the time he was preparing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon . I also almost got a part in a Zhang Yimou film - but he said he wanted to shoot an action movie, just as I was thinking of taking up dramatic parts.\" </p> <p>If there is one topic that Chan likes to talk about, it is the return of Hong Kong to China and its benefits. He adopted such a forthright public stance on the issue that China's main television channel, CCTV, named him as an \"inspirational person\" of the year for his \"patriotic passion\". Chan describes Beijing's influence on the Hong Kong cinema as follows: \"They let us do what we want, but if the movie is too violent or too sexy it won't get released in China. And as it's well known that China is a huge market, we automatically cut out the violence and the sex - which is a good thing, as there's too much violence. It's getting worse and worse. China wants to prove that it can do better than the British, and there's more and more freedom in Hong Kong. But freedom has made people selfish.\"</p>",
  "<p>TV crews put their lives at risk today to provide dramatic reports from inside the Russian school siege in which more than 100 people were reported to have been killed and more than 400 injured.</p> <p>ITV, the BBC, Sky News and CNN all managed to get into the school grounds to provide close-up pictures of the chaotic scenes around the gym where bodies of the hostages were said to have been piled up.</p> <p>ITV cleared its schedule to cover the unfolding horror with a virtual non-stop running commentary from veteran Julian Manyon, who was crouched outside the gym for the entire hour and a half of the special bulletin.</p> <p>BBC correspondent Jonathan Charles and Sky News' Rachel Amatt also risked their lives to bring live reports from the scene. </p> <p>A BBC spokesman said Charles narrowly avoided being shot as a bullet whizzed past him live on air. News 24 claims to have beaten ITV into the school grounds by around 20 minutes.</p> <p>Manyon reported from outside the building, initially by videophone, and then managed to get into the school compound for a close-up account, as did Sky and the BBC.</p> <p>Amid chaotic scenes around the school, it appears the media have been ahead of the Russian authorities in estimating casualties, with ITN's Russian cameraman, Sacha Lomakin, reporting up to 100 bodies lying in the gymnasium.</p> <p>Lomakin managed to get into the gym and take two minutes of footage before he was thrown out by Russian troops still battling with the hostage takers.</p> <p>He reported that there were around 100 bodies on the \"charred and smouldering\" ground of the gym.</p> <p>The ITV editor-in-chief, David Mannion, said he had not yet transmitted pictures from within the gym because he wanted to vet them for taste and decency purposes.</p> <p>\"We have to be careful what we show. Obviously the pictures we have already seen are distressing with children naked or semi-naked,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I haven't seen the pictures from the gym yet, because the electricity has been cut over there, but we will see them later and decide what we can show.\"</p> <p>Mr Mannion said he was concerned about his reporter's safety but that Manyon had taken a decision just before the lunchtime news to \"take a calculated risk\" and get into the school grounds, as had the reporter from Sky News.</p> <p>\"It all happened so fast. Julian decided on the spot. They got inside the open air quadrangle around the school first and then the cameraman managed to climb inside the gym,\" said Mr Mannion.</p> <p>ITV's report that around 100 corpses lay in the gym was picked up by other news channels including Sky News, an unusual occurence.</p> <p>Pictures from the school showed the pandemonium as firefighters battled to put out a fire and special troops continued to end the seige, which could end up being the worst terrorist crisis suffered by Russia.</p> <p>During his non-stop reporting, Manyon reported that a Russian soldier was shot \"no more than 10 yards away from us\". He added there were \"still some live bullets whizzing past where we are\". </p> <p>A clearly concerned Nicholas Owen, in the studio, repeatedly told Manyon to take care of himself in the increasingly perilous situation.</p> <p>Manyon also reported that a news cameraman, presumed to be near to the gym, had been hit by gunfire.</p> <p>\"A news cameraman was hit about 30 minutes ago. I can't tell you who he was or which network he worked for but he was wounded and taken away,\" he said.</p> <p>Manyon was providing commentary from a vantage point about 20 yards from the gym, crouching behind a side building abutting the main school building to watch the crisis unfold.</p> <p>The scene was one of chaos with dozens of civilians milling round with no apparent crowd control by the authorities. </p> <p>All three networks were carrying the same pictures but Manyon appeared to have scooped everyone with his continuous eye witness account</p> <p>Owen repeatedly voiced concern for Manyon's safety. \"It sounds to me just that you have been horribly close to some of these bullets,\" he said, advising Manyon to \"take care\".</p> <p>Sky News also got within yards of the gym to provide dramatic pictures. </p> <p>International broadcasters including CNN, APTN and Reuters were also providing live pictures this morning.

  "<p>Director Jonathan Demme yesterday used the Venice film festival to criticise the current state of American politics. On the second day of the cinema event, and on the same day that George Bush officially became the Republican presidential candidate, the Silence of the Lambs creator said, \"As an American, I really feel my country is in a lot of trouble. I think our leaders have taken us in a really bad direction on so many levels.\"</p> <p>Demme, who is in town with a remake of the Cold War thriller The Manchurian Candidate, was asked whether there were parallels between his film and the current international climate, \"I feel that our leaders really want to own the world for two reasons. Firstly, there are endless profits from owning the entire world, and secondly because if you own and control the world, there is a relief from fear.\"</p> <p>The director went on to criticise the close ties between big business and US politicians, \"That is the big struggle of the moment, and it is coming to a head in a couple of months. We have untold millions who want to return to a richer sense of democracy.\"</p>",
  "<p>GCSE coursework is neither demanding nor stimulating, is rife with plagiarism and should be dropped, according to the head of the school with the best results in the country. </p> <p>Dr Martin Stephen, master of St Paul's school in Barnes, south west London, said some of his most able pupils were bored by coursework. </p> <p>He told EducationGuardian.co.uk: \"Coursework at GCSE has completely had its time and should be abolished as soon as possible. </p> <p>\"It's not demanding or stimulating. It's routine and very often appears to invite young people to go for length rather than quality. We are a selective school, so inevitably have highly selected students. The more able the student the more they will produce - not just coursework, but a full length book.\"</p> <p>Dr Stephen, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, which today published GCSE scores for its member schools, said the coursework element was rife with cheating - particularly for those who had access to the internet.</p> <p>\"It's almost impossible to control or contain the plagiarism now... It is also discriminatory; infinitely easier for young people with home internet access or, for that matter, in a house with books. The exams shouldn't measure that environment.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Coursework was a good idea but it hasn't worked.\"</p> <p>However, he did say the exams should be retained, despite the fact that other independent schools are opting to replace GCSEs and A-levels with the international baccalaureate. </p> <p>Some exams - including chemistry - were, he said, still \"quite demanding\", but he refused to name the ones he believed were not. </p> <p>At St Paul's, where boarding fees are \u00a319,131 a year and 165 candidates achieved an average of 81.9 points at GCSE - the equivalent of at least 10 A-stars - pupils are encouraged to sit up to 11 exams to give them the broadest possible education. The government has set a benchmark of students attaining five A-star to Cs as a desirable pass rate.</p> <p>A Department for Education and Skills spokeswoman said coursework formed an important part of GCSE exams and could be \"a valuable way of assessing achievement and skills that cannot readily be demonstrated in an examination, including practical and oral skills and the ability to tackle extended pieces of written work\".</p> <p>\"There are measures in place throughout the system to ensure that plagiarism is detected and dealt with. There are clear guidelines and procedures in place for dealing with cases of dishonesty, malpractice, and maladministration,\" she added.</p> <p>\"We have asked the working group on 14 to 19 reform to make recommendations on assessment arrangements, including coursework, as well as the overall amount of assessment manageable for teachers and learners alike.\"</p> <p>GCSEs were introduced in 1986 - bringing with them the first widespread use of coursework.</p> <p>The future of GCSEs and A-levels is currently being debated. The former Ofsted chief, Mike Tomlinson, is due to present a report on the future of assessment for 14 to 19-year-olds in the autumn, in which he will tackle the place coursework should have in an over-arching diploma that could eventually replace the two exams.</p>",
  "The European commission today launched legal action against the government over \"unacceptable\" failings in dealing with nuclear waste at Sellafield. <p>Government plans submitted to Brussels in June to improve waste monitoring were rejected as an inadequate response to long-standing commission complaints about breaches of EU nuclear safety rules.</p> <p>After the legal step was decided at talks in Brussels, the commission vice-president responsible for energy policy, Loyola de Palacio, said she had a duty to protect the interests of citizens.</p> <p>But she also made clear that the commission would call off the court action even at this stage if forthcoming talks with the British authorities produced a clear timetable for complying with nuclear safety legislation.</p> <p>The dispute is over verification of the safety of spent nuclear fuel which is currently stored in a \"pond\" at the Sellafield site, run by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) in Cumbria.</p> <p>The government has acknowledged the problems of accounting precisely for the waste, but ministers are annoyed that the commission is pursuing BNFL using rules designed to ensure nuclear waste does not get into the wrong hands. </p> <p>There is no suggestion that the waste has gone astray - just concern in Brussels that EU inspectors cannot comprehensively verify the state of the waste as required.</p> <p>The inspectors complain that they do not have sufficient physical access to the \"pond\" site at Sellafield, which they are meant to check to ensure nuclear material is not being diverted from peaceful uses.</p> <p>Ms De Palacio said of the legal action: \"The commission has to protect the general interest of EU citizens, which cannot be subordinated to political, technical or other considerations.\"</p> <p>She added: \"We will be holding discussions with the British authorities. If we can agree on a clear timetable which includes deadlines and financial commitments, then we can stop this action in the European court.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry disputed that the EU's responsibilities under the Euratom treaty extended to matters of health and safety.</p> <p>\"The Euratom treaty safeguards at issue here are neither safety nor environment-related controls,\" he said. </p> <p>\"They require the commission to satisfy itself that nuclear materials 'are not diverted from their intended uses as declared by their users'. </p> <p>\"Safety and environment-related controls fall within the remit of the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency.\"</p>",
  "<p>Senior Whitehall mandarin Nicholas Kroll is to be the BBC's first director of governance, the department being set up to provide independent advice to the chairman and board of governors. </p> <p>Mr Kroll, the chief operating officer at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, will take up the role on October 1, the BBC chairman, Michael Grade, said today.</p> <p>His appointment is part of Mr Grade's declared mission to separate the governors from management in the wake of the devastating Hutton inquiry that cost the jobs of both the director general and the chairman. It also means the end of the role of BBC secretary, who traditionally acted as the glue between the management and the board of governors. The role is being radically reshaped after the Hutton inquiry criticised the lack of detachment between the BBC executive and the board of governors.</p> <p>Mr Grade announced the changes to the corporation's governance in his Building Public Value manifesto.</p> <p>Under Mr Kroll's leadership the existing governance and accountability unit will be restructured. It will report solely to the chairman and board of governors, ending previous ties to the director general and BBC management.</p> <p>The new unit will also recruit experts from the fields of TV, journalism, business and the law in a bid to ensure that any advice provided to the board is as impartial and authoritative as possible.</p> <p>\"It's not just a question of changing the badge on the door. Under Nicholas Kroll it will become a new department,\" said one senior BBC insider. </p> <p>BBC insiders said Mr Kroll would begin recruiting expert advisers as soon as he arrived, although how many will be seconded to the governance unit is still up for grabs.</p> <p>\"It's for him to work out what the exact set-up will be, though I imagine that it will be similar in size to the current governance and accountability department,\" said one.</p> <p>Formally the BBC secretariat, the current department was created about 18 months ago under the auspices of the BBC secretary, Simon Milner. It employs about 18 people.</p> <p>Mr Milner will stay on until Mr Kroll's arrival but is expected to leave his post once the new governance director is up and running. </p> <p>\"Simon's job as secretary will not continue as it is, though it has some functions in it that Nicholas Kroll will want to look at,\" said the insider.</p> <p>\"There will have to be somebody who is looking at how the relationship between the two boards is managed and how their business plans are implemented.\"</p> <p>Mr Grade said that after a \"thorough and open\" recruitment process Mr Kroll was the board's \"unanimous choice\".</p> <p>\"His intellectual rigour, broadcasting and wider public policy experience, and proven independence and objectivity will prove invaluable in setting up and directing the new governance unit,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Kroll has been chief operating officer and deputy to the permanent secretary at DCMS for the last two years.</p> <p>Prior to that he served as the department's corporate services director. Between 1995 to 1996 Mr Kroll was head of the DCMS's broadcast and policy unit. </p> <p>An Oxford garduate, Mr Kroll began his civil service career at the Department of Environment and Transport before moving to the Treasury where he led the banking policy branch.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>For the first time, TV advertisers and broadcasters will be able to tell who exactly is watching specific programmes, after the ratings measurement body, the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (Barb), announced a major study into viewers' lifestyles, hobbies and interests. </p> <p>At the moment Barb classifies viewers according to their sex, their age and their socio-economic groups, but now advertisers say they need to know more about the viewers they need to reach.</p> <p>They want to know what type of car viewers drive, what supermarket they use and what they do with the rest of their leisure time when they are not watching TV.</p> <p>Agencies claim that these days there is little point targeting people using the demographic criteria that were popular in the 1980s, ranking the population in groupings such as ABC1 and C2, and prefer instead to focus on common interests, passions and beliefs. </p> <p>Using the new criteria, ratings data will be analysed against information about leisure time, travel, car ownership, home and shopping and other media consumption.</p> <p>The data should enable advertisers to pinpoint more accurately whether the shows in which they are advertising are hitting their target audience. </p> <p>For example, they will be able to tell whether viewers of a particular show spend more than average on gardening or DIY, whether they are frequent air travellers, what sort of car they drive, and so on. </p> <p>\"We expect this service to be of high value across the media industry - from advertisers and agencies to broadcasters and programme makers,\" said Barb's chief executive, Bjarne Thelin, who took the helm last year following the turbulent introduction of a new panel and rows over the accuracy of ratings. </p> <p>\"At a time when there is an increasing call for cross-media understanding, the additional panel classifications of 'lifestyle insights' will also add to the available information,\" he added.</p> <p>The information should also prove useful to advertisers attempting to gauge where to spend their money in other media. Using the new data they will be able to tell, for example, which newspapers are read by the viewers of a particular programme. </p> <p>It could even form a part of the BBC's case for charter renewal - if the corporation can prove its programmes are being watched by those with minority interests not catered for elsewhere, it will help its argument for the licence fee. </p> <p>The move will be seen as a reaction to criticism from some in the advertising industry over the depth of data provided by Barb, which is funded by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel Five, BSkyB and the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising. </p> <p>It measures the viewing of a panel of around 5,000 viewers automatically via a black box under their TV. When a viewer enters a room with the television on, they are required to press a button on a special remote control handset to register their presence.</p> <p>Earlier this week business channel CNBC announced it was to resign from Barb because it did not measure ratings outside the home, where most of its viewers watched the channel. </p> <p>It felt it needed an alternative system to reflect the high usage in hotel rooms, where other channels such as CNN and news channels also miss out on ratings charts.</p> <p>Sky sports and the terrestrial channels also have major gaps in the ratings during big football or rugby matches when vast portions opt for the atmosphere of a pub to watch.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>The government has been accused of \"conning\" hundreds of thousands of council tenants after it emerged it may renege on a promise to allow them to keep their cherished status as council tenants.</p> <p>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) has earmarked significant grants to repair council homes if tenants agree to switch the management of their homes to new arm's-length management organisations (Almos).</p> <p>With one notable exception in Camden, the initiative has proved popular with tenants because, although management of housing switches to the new organisation, the ownership of their homes stays with the council.</p> <p>This has generally helped to reassure council tenants that the extra rights they enjoy compared to housing association tenants will not be taken away by opting for Almos.</p> <p>However, a new paper from the ODPM proposes giving Almos complete ownership of council homes, perhaps as early as 2006, as one of a number of options for the future.</p> <p>Defend Council Housing, which campaigns against Almos and stock transfer to housing associations, said the plans were a \"betrayal\" of tenants who had been told Almos were not a first step to privatisation.</p> <p>Committee member Alan Walter said: \"It was always our argument that the government brought in Almos as stock transfer by the back door because they could not get tenants to agree to transfer in many areas. </p> <p>\"We always said it was a two-stage privatisation to get housing out of councils' hands completely. This confirms our predictions.\"</p> <p>While councils must get the support of tenants through a ballot for stock transfer, there is no such legal requirement for Almos, although some authorities like Camden have put the issue to the vote.</p> <p>\"An awful lot of tenants have been deliberately conned,\" he said. \"We will be demanding that ballots are held before ownership is transferred.\"</p> <p>A review body, comprising officials from the ODPM, the Treasury, the Audit Commission, Almo chief executives, council housing directors and tenants' representatives, will meet for the first time this month. </p> <p>The team will report to ministers in January on options for the future of Almos after they have met the government's target to bring all homes up to a decent standard by 2010. They will consider everything from Almos taking on ownership of stock to homes reverting to council control.</p> <p>Mike Owen, the chief executive of Carrick Housing, an Almo in Cornwall, said he was hoping the review would come up with some radical options. </p> <p>He called for consideration of allowing Almos greater borrowing flexibility while remaining under council ownership, as well as tenant-led transfers.</p> <p>\"Some Almos have almost reached the decent homes target and there needs to be consideration of the way forward,\" he said. \"They have been a great success. I don't think tenants who have lived under five or 10 years of improvement will be fearful of Almos so I do not see why we should be hostages to Defend Council Housing shouting privatisation.\"</p> <p>John Perry, a policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Housing, said the review could lead to a new housing sector, that of council-owned housing associations.</p> <p>\"There would have to be two main changes to the rules,\" he said. \"The government would have to treat publicly owned companies differently from direct spending by central and local government, as happens in the rest of Europe. And local authority owned associations would have to be permitted to register with the Housing Corporation. Obviously these are big changes.\"</p>",
  "Last November, in the final throes of the New England fall, my best friend Josephine Ross was driving her son to school in her Honda stickshift. (She always drives a manual rather than an automatic, to conserve fuel. In today's America, even the car you drive is a political statement.) The news came over the car radio. The Massachusetts supreme judicial court had made a majority ruling: \"We declare that barring an individual from the protections, benefits and obligations of civil marriage solely because that person would marry a member of the same sex violates the Massachusetts constitution.\" Within six months, Jo's home state would become the first in America to grant civil marriage licences to gay and lesbian couples. Jo, 46, and her son Sam, 13, whooped with joy. Jo, who has a celebratory disco song to belt out for every occasion, began, \"It started with a kiss. Never thought it would come to this ... \" and Sam joined in. <p>That evening, as Jo came down the stairs, her partner of 21 years, Christine Guilfoy, was waiting on her knees. \"Will you marry me?\" she asked. Jo replied, \"Yes, yes, yes, yes !\" So last month, I flew to America, and there I was, giving a blessing at their wedding. </p> <p>One hundred and fifty guests lined the long wooden pews of the Universalist church in the small fishing port of Gloucester. Jo is Jewish and Chris was raised a Catholic, so they were married under a huppah (the traditional Jewish wedding tent) with the taut and wiry Rabbi Karen Landy and the avuncular Reverend Wendy Fitting presiding, two clergy from central casting. (They couldn't marry in a synagogue not because they are women - liberal and reform synagogues premit same-sex marriages - but because Chris isn't Jewish.) </p> <p>When Massachusetts first recognised same-sex marriages, there was an unseemly rush up the aisle. Within a week, 1,800 marriage licences were issued to same-sex couples, the vast majority of them women. Long-term lesbian unions tend to be even more monogamous and enduring than straight marriages. Men, it seems, gay or straight, are simply far less eager to commit. </p> <p>Already Jo had been to the gay marriages of many of her friends, hurried through on a wave of enthusiasm and the underlying worry that the decision could be reversed (as it has in California, where last month 4,000 same-sex marriages were annulled). Many of these were conveyor-belt weddings, so that guests witnessed not only their friends' marriage but several that came before as they waited for their friends' slot. Jo remembers watching two older gay men she had never met. The reverend announced that this was a special day for them, not only because they were getting married, but because it was their 33rd anniversary. \"Their 33rd,\" said Jo. \"They'd had to wait so very, very long.\" </p> <p>Jo, a lawyer and relentless organiser, was determined that her wedding would not be rushed but a properly planned event. There would be fresh flowers and live music and appropriate readings. Everything had to be perfect. She became a wedding bore. Did she really need to email me full details of who would be making which toasts and for how long, when I didn't know half the other guests anyway? Did Jo think that being gay made her agonising over where to hold the reception (the local arts association hall or a more expensive hotel), and what should be on the menu (mini pizzas or angels on horseback) any more interesting? </p> <p>On the day itself, the family gathering resembled the line-up at any wedding: there was Jo's 85-year-old father and her two-year-old niece, there were women in lilac and men in suits. Jo's lilac silk trouser suit might have worked just as well at a church wedding in Tunbridge Wells, although perhaps not on the bride. But the opening \"statements of appreciation\" by the betrotheds were determinedly different. </p> <p>\"I love you for agreeing to do things that wouldn't have been your first choice: tennis lessons, family bridge games, a large wedding,\" Jo began. (Chris, eight years older and far more cautious, would have gone for something more modest.) \"I love you for your drive to accomplish things in your life - and in mine,\" Chris responded. They are so unalike, and yet they have never attempted to change each other, as so many heterosexual couples do. \"I imagine growing old together, driving you crazy with my chatter,\" said Jo. Chris ended: \"I look forward to rocking on the porch in our old age, me still in my pyjamas, dreaming of companionable silence; you wearing running shoes, chattering about the plans for the day.\" </p> <p>Sam, beaming down on his two moms (he is taller than both of them), handed the rings to Rabbi Karen. As the marriage licence was signed, she announced: \"With the power invested in me by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I now pronounce you finally, and at long last, legally married, bound together in body and soul.\" The glass was crushed beneath their feet, and we all cheered, \"Mazel tov!\" It was one of the few moments in theceremony that the couple hadn't written themselves. </p> <p>At the reception (Jo went for the cheaper local hall in the end), friends took turns reading out poems, recalling shared experiences, and belting out songs they had adapted for the day. To the tune of New York, New York, we all sang, \"Start spreading the news./The court gave its OK./ They ruled for full equality,/For Chris and Jo ... \" </p> <p>When Jo's older brother got married four years earlier, he had to shoulder all sorts of family obligations, and his father had insisted he invite all his work colleagues. Jo escaped all of this; everyone who was at her wedding was there because they wanted to be. And Jo and Chris were getting married simply because they both really, really wanted to - and had done for a very long time. </p> <p>Unlike the union of so many straight couples, gay marriages are not about the bonding of two clans. In fact, they are usually the very opposite. A gay marriage is often the last straw for a family that can't accept the homosexuality of one of its members. Two of Chris's brothers (one with his male partner) and one of her sisters came to the wedding, but her mother, a staunch Catholic, refused to attend. She missed a great wedding. </p> <p>Perhaps, as gay marriages inevitably become more common, this wonder will lessen, and they will deteriorate into formulaic, impersonal, duty-bound events, just like the sort we have all been to many times before. Lesbians will get married to their long-term lovers because it will please their mothers. Gay men will tie the knot because that is what men who have been living together for some time are expected to do. Of course, this can't happen until straight and gay relationships are regarded as equal. Then, ironically, beautiful weddings like my best friend's could be a casualty. Equality can make you dull. </p> <p>Already some guests at Jo's wedding were getting cynical. Kate and Lyn had married in May, as soon as they could, after 11 years together, driving an open-top limousine through downtown Boston with a \"Just Legally Married\" banner tied across the bonnet; Lyn proudly introduced Kate to me as \"my lovely wife\". \"We always thought of marriage as a conservative thing,\" confesses Kate. \"Now we're all clamouring for it.\" Lyn knows why - it is because they have become professional, middle-aged women. \"Feminists used to be really against marriage because it was all about property, and we didn't have any. Now we're all for it, because it's all about property, and we've got some,\" she says. It is estimated that, in America, some 1,400 constitutional rights are denied to non-married couples. (The situation is better in Britain, where the state provides a financial safety net.) In America, with privatised healthcare and few social benefits, the legal status of marriage becomes more important. Even so, neither Kate and Lyn's, nor Jo and Chris's, nor any other same-sex marriage is recognised outside the Massachusetts state borders. If Jo and Chris moved to Missouri, they would be single again. </p> <p>Gay marriage remains a central political issue in the US, and in the forthcoming presidential election. George Bush wants a change in the constitution, to keep \"the meaning of marriage from being changed for ever\". On August 17, to prevent prospective gay brides and grooms flocking across the border, a supreme court judge ruled that out-of-state couples were barred from marrying in Massachusetts. Since the initial Massachusetts ruling last November, more than 35 states have introduced legislation aimed at preserving the definition of marriage as only between a woman and a man. </p> <p>Jo knows that, however wonderful her wedding and strong her relationship, it is possible that her marriage may not last. Last February, Meg and Lauren, wedding guests from California, queued for three days outside San Francisco city hall to tie the knot, one of more than 4,000 same-sex couples who took advantage of a change in the Californian state law that lasted just a month. Meg told me how she felt a thrill every time she ticked the \"married\" box on surveys. But last month, after California's highest court nullified every one of those licences, Meg and Lauren's marriage was dissolved. That small gesture of ticking a box marked \"married\", which gave Meg such pleasure, has now been denied her. </p> <p>But here, for now, were Jo and Chris, just legally married, dancing at their wedding reception in the arts association hall. It was a night of disco anthems - I Am What I Am, We Are Family, Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves. </p> <p>Then came, \"It started with a kiss\", bellowing out as I danced and danced at my best friend's wonderful wedding. Thank goodness that, for a few, and for a while at least, it can now come to this. </p> <p><b>Two is a couple ... sometimes</b></p> <p> <b> In the US</b><br> </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> President George W Bush is seeking a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriages across the US.

  "<p><strong> Robin Cook</strong><br> Labour MP for Livingston </p> <p>The countdown to the Iraq war was an emotionally charged period for me, which made watching its replay a particularly powerful experience, but I suspect David Hare's work will move anyone who opposed the whole misadventure. </p> <p>He has centred his drama very much on the process by which the Bush administration settled on the invasion of Iraq. There is a strategic truth in this focus, as it was a war made in Washington. It has the merit that it brings back the reality that Tony Blair took Britain into the war primarily to preserve his status as the closest ally of whoever is in the White House. The exchanges between Blair and his advisers on weapons of mass destruction are accurately portrayed as discussions about how to present the case for war rather than a debate on whether there was a case for war. </p> <p>If I have a reservation about the portrayal of Blair, it is that he is presented as too agonised, too conscious of the political gamble he was taking. I fear this interpretation owes much to his evident bewilderment a year later that his Iraq adventure remains such a source of controversy. At the time the most marked characteristic of Blair was faith that the war option was the right one and his conviction that when it was won, the public would forget the controversy over its origins. Some more self-doubt on his part might have given a better chance of success to those of us who urged him to apply the brakes. </p> <p>The downside of centring the action within the Bush administration is that drama requires tension and there is not much evidence that there was any real debate among the power-brokers in Washington over their common obsession with conquering Iraq. The result is that Colin Powell, the secretary of state, has to be built up into a more heroic figure of resistance than he deserves. It is certainly true that he was kept in the dark about the real game plan of the administration. When I met him immediately after his appointment, he told me that his top priority was to rebuild America's standing in the Arab world, which in retrospect appears richly ironic. He was not responsible for the decision to invade Iraq and always suspected it would end in tears, but perhaps that only makes him more culpable for not taking a stand against it. </p> <p>The play's epilogue from an Iraqi lamenting the incompetence, ignorance and brutality of the occupation is perfectly judged. It conveys the central truth that a better future for Iraqis can only be built by themselves and will not be the result of any solution imposed by us. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Robin Cook, formerly foreign secretary, resigned as leader of the commons on March 18 2003 in protest at Britain's going to war with Iraq. </p> <p><strong> Polly Toynbee</strong><br> Guardian columnist </p> <p>What is the theatre for? On the stage, the muse of fire has a licence to go anywhere - inside the brain of any murderer, martyr or megalomaniac. It can chase an idea down to its raw core, skewer any national fear or hope. Imagination set free can paint in vivid colours, where documentary is grey. But Stuff Happens is grey, very grey. </p> <p>For three long hours it takes us only where we have been before, over and over. It is elegant, brilliantly acted, but deja vu. It travels no deeper and explores no wilder realm of myth to unpeel people, actions or nations. Nor is it savage satire. Documentary has the asset of truth: real-life footage is always electric. Brian Lapping and Norma Percy used to make brilliant TV reconstructions of recent political crises with journalists playing the parts, scripted as near as dammit to the facts. But this is hybrid with bias, neither actuality nor seeking inner truth. </p> <p>As a strong opponent of the war, I still wriggled at its manipulation. Tell us why they did it - it is not enough to offer the American president as a God-fearing moron and Tony Blair as a self-deceiving, moralising fool. The shocking 9/11 moment was no non-event, as Hare paints it here. And what of the ideas that drove all this? Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, and the rest have their vision. Blair's speech about a chance to reorder the world needs an answer, not a pitying shrug. </p> <p>The audience ached to giggle, wishing it was Michael Moore, which it is not. Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 took us to real people touched by all this: remember the poor young black men signing up for the army. Here instead is a parade of ghosts, the shells of the key players without hearts or minds. In the programme, Michael Ignatieff's reprise of the anguished arguments over the moral duty to use force for good is a reminder of what is missing here. </p> <p>Stuff Happens flickers to life only when it departs from reality - when Colin Powell makes a great speech to the president to try to stop the unstoppable machine of war rolling forward. But this is a play from no one's point of view, narrated from on high, the actions of the politicians observed like ants down the author's disapproving nose, never from within any character. </p> <p>It is admirable and necessary for the National Theatre to pursue plays about now. Political theatre is hideously difficult. But a blow-by-blow account of the White House and No 10's road to Iraq felt like yesterday already. Out there hundreds of young Russian children were locked in a school surrounded by Chechen men and women with explosives strapped to their bodies. Out there is the boiling rage of the third world rising up against the first world, using the name of Islam as a battle flag. This is a thin reply, mere lofty distaste for the politicians obliged to respond, however frighteningly wrong they get it. </p> <p><strong> Scott Ritter</strong><br> Former weapons inspector  </p> <p>As an American, I have to confess to having felt some unease as I sat in the audience for this play. It is never easy to watch one's own government portrayed as cartoon figures, especially when the depictions are derived from fact, not fiction. While cringing at the damning self-indictments of Bush's inner circle - Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Condoleezza Rice and Dick Cheney - transpiring on stage, I couldn't help but wonder what Tony Blair did to have his role in the lead-up to the war with Iraq portrayed in such a sympathetic, albeit weak-kneed, manner. Hare's play places the blame for the Iraq war squarely on the shoulders of the arrogant Americans, while covering up Blair's own complicity and deviousness in the matter. </p> <p>Ironically, the one character with whom I had sympathy is the one I am most vocal in my criticism of today: George Bush. He is portrayed - not inaccurately - as a simple, arrogant man; nevertheless, my heart reached out when the play reenacted the moment on September 11 2001 when he learned that the twin towers had collapsed, killing 3,000 innocent civilians, and forcing America and the world down an uncertain path. What was he thinking? How oppressively heavy was the weight history had placed on his shoulders? The play doesn't help, as the Bush character simply receives the news and exits stage left, marching inexorably towards his ill-fated confrontation with Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>\"This splendid thing done,\" says an anonymous chorus member in the first act, arguing for the legitimacy of a war that achieved the demise of a brutal dictator. Regardless of the flaws in the reasons for going to war (such as the failure to find any weapons of mass destruction), \"the action remains pure\". And thus Hare offers up the classic defence of the Iraq war: in the effort to remove Saddam, the ends justify the means. In many ways, the soliloquies by the pro-invasion cho rus were among the most impassioned words uttered in this play. They also provide the most damning indictment of those who in the US and Britain continue to support this war long after the stated reason has been shown to be false. </p> <p>We claim to be citizens of representative democracies. Our democracies are built on a foundation of law, and our success as democratic societies stipulates adherence by all - governed and governing - to this law. For our societies to function, the means are the ends; due process must be respected. \"How western we are,\" says another chorus member, chiding us for allowing ourselves to fall victim to the trap of putting democratic process before the elimination of a dictator. </p> <p>I look back at my years of defending this process and respond, with pride, \"Yes, how western I am.\" Thank you, David Hare, for helping to remind me. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Scott Ritter was the UN's chief weapons inspector in Iraq until he resigned in 1998. </p> <p><strong> Gavyn Davies</strong><br> Former chairman, BBC governors </p> <p>\"Stuff happens,\" said Donald Rumsfeld (the ultimate anti-hero of David Hare's play), when asked as defence secretary what he thought of the chaos of postwar Iraq. Most of the stuff that happens - in Hare's view of the build-up to war - is duplicitous, incompetent, self-serving or (in the case of the American neo-cons) just plain evil. No one should go to a Hare play expecting to get the kind of unbiased view of history that would get past the BBC board of governors. But can everyone involved in this sorry saga really have been this bad? </p> <p>As the narrative unfolds, we meet a halfwit President Bush, a haughty Condoleezza, a dark and forbidding Paul Wolfowitz, a feeble Richard Dearlove, a servile David Manning, a tinpot Alastair Campbell and, etched more clearly than anyone else, a sweaty and unctuous Tony Blair, contemptuously dismissed by Vice-President Dick Cheney as \"a preacher on top of a tank\". Not all of these caricatures rang true. For example, those European politicians who really believe that Bush is a halfwit are condemned to be dominated and manipulated by him, probably for four more years. </p> <p>Hare's version of the history of 2003 wisely gave no truck to the war against the BBC waged by Campbell from Downing Street, a diversionary and irrelevant tactic that sucked in the British media but which is now laid bare for what it always was. However, Hare does have a strong view about the production of the flawed \"intelligence\" dossier produced by No10 in September 2002 to justify the war. This is depicted as a deliberate attempt by the prime minister, not by Campbell, to fabricate the evidence of an imminent Iraqi threat to UK interests because this falsehood was needed to make the war legal. Surely this can't be true, at least according to the gospels of their hand-picked lordships, Hutton and Butler? Presumably not, but the Olivier audience seemed disposed to view their lordships' exonerations as works of fiction, while placing credence in the Hare version of history. </p> <p>And as for me? All I have learned is that, in the murky world of Whitehall politics, stuff happens. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Gavyn Davies became head of the BBC board of governors on October 1 2001. He resigned on January 28 2004 after the publication of the Hutton report. </p> <p><strong> David Aaronovitch</strong><br> Commentator  </p> <p>Michael Moore this ain't. I went to the play worrying that all the praise heaped upon Hare by anti-war simplifiers and theatrical amateur politicians portended yet another silly and vulgar oil 'n spin conspiracy saga. I was completely wrong, and really ought to have known better. But I don't think I was the only one; some in the audience were obviously disappointed that instead of a festival of self-affirmation, what they got was something far more complex and ambivalent. </p> <p>So ambivalent, in fact, that - with one or two fairly minor changes - you could have shown this play to an audience of intelligent Republicans and had them laughing and applauding, albeit in completely different places. Far from being joke figures or cartoon baddies, US administration figures such as Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney are portrayed as witty, determined and ruthless in their pursuit of what they see as America's interests. It is unsettling that many of the best lines in the play belong to them. And while the audience began by laughing at Bush's Christian religiosity (in a way that they wouldn't have, had he been, say, a Muslim), they weren't laughing at it by the end. </p> <p>It is also much more challenging for someone, like me - who decided to back the invasion - to have a character give an excellent and well-written precis of many of my own arguments, even if one of the objects of the play is to try to prove that character wrong. And Hare's implied critique of the way in which Britain and America went to war is of the tricky Cookite variety, rather than the tedious B-liar kind. Strangely, this eventually leaves the impression that Hare thinks that war might have been justified had the French and others only voted for a second UN resolution. </p> <p>It is the French who are, in some ways, the unexpected villains of the show, privately informing Colin Powell that they will happily tolerate an invasion of Iraq, providing America does not press for a second UN resolution - and this after having themselves earlier demanded a second resolution. </p> <p>Blair himself is seen as a thwarted idealist, attempting to stay on side with a US administration which cares little for his vision of nation-building and world salvation. It is a potent interpretation of the events of the past three years and the one that I most fear in my heart may be true. But it is also an interpretation that won't win Hare friends among those who like their politics kept simple. </p> <p><strong> Ann Widdecombe</strong><br> Conservative MP for Maidstone and the Weald </p> <p>I might have said that Stuff Happens is the most blatant subverting of art for the purposes of crude propaganda since that of Leni Riefenstahl, but there is no art involved, no characterisation, no coherent plot, no empathy. A vast cast lines up on stage and players step forward one by one, cued by a narrator, walk to the front of the stage and utter a few words, sometimes a few sentences, before returning to their place in the line. It is reminiscent of an end-of-term production in an infant school, but nothing like as riveting. The woman beside me went to sleep, the man in front consulted his watch at least 20 times, and so did I. There was some determined laughter from one small pocket in a very large audience. The rest yawned their way through. </p> <p>The director faced the usual dilemma of casting actors as characters with whose features, mannerisms and vocal patterns we are closely familiar. In such circumstances one must decide whether to aim for verisimilitude or to dispense with it. This play did neither. Iain Mitchell occasionally sounded like Jack Straw, Nicholas Farrell gave a less than convincing imitation of Blair's cadences, but most actors wisely recognised that they would prefer to be Olivier rather than Bremner. </p> <p>There is a scattering of good lines in an otherwise pedestrian script, causing the audience, momentarily released from the grip of tedium, to laugh with as much relief as appreciation, such as when a deeply frustrated Blair snarls that Hans Blix is running round Mesopotamia like Hercule Poirot. </p> <p>Occasionally there is also some genuinely thought-provoking reflection. Near the beginning there is a soliloquy that poses serious moral dilemmas. If Iraq were a European country invading its neighbours and killing its own citizens, would we then stand upon the rulebook? Would we then base our judgments on the personalities of Blair and Bush? Would we then suspend horror in favour of legal argument? But, of course, this is not Europe ... just Arabs. </p> <p>The audience sat tensely through this speech and there were one or two other moments when conscience and moral discernment were audibly challenged, when you could hear it in the silence, when the soft rustle of ennui was briefly suspended. Alas, such moments are rare in this play of cardboard characters. Perhaps Hare wrote it in too great a hurry. My advice is not to be in any hurry to see it. </p> <p><strong> Tim Collins</strong><br> Officer in the Iraq invasion </p> <p>I approached Stuff Happens with a certain amount of scepticism. My preconception was that a David Hare play presented at the National Theatre was inevitably going to be a simplistic attack on the establishment on both sides of the Atlantic. I had prepared myself for a highbrow Fahrenheit 9/11. </p> <p>In fact, I found the play to be a thought-provoking spectacle, casting new light on the event which has thus far defined the new century. In doing so it has reanimated the doubts and fears over the reasons for war which I and millions have harboured over the past year. </p> <p>Above all, I found emotional resonance in its stark question: what if Iraq had been a European country? Would we have hesitated? Would there have been such a debate on the righteousness of the attack? But even as the audience grappled with these issues, one of the characters reminded us of the arrogance of sitting in a theatre considering them, when a key Middle Eastern country has been plunged into chaos and thousands of lives lost. The theatrical switchback neatly reflected a moral conundrum that has not been lost on the nation. </p> <p>At the close of the play an Iraqi exile (Raad Rawi) movingly observes that while accurate figures exist for every type of coalition casualty, even bullets fired and dollars spent, there is no count to within thousands of the Iraqi death toll, and no one seems to care. </p> <p>For me as a commander passionately committed to avoiding casualties on both sides, this was another issue I was glad to see exposed. If you were to judge the validity of the casus belli by examining American plans for nation-building, then this chilling lack of concern for the people we sought to liberate actually exposes a flagrant disregard for them. </p> <p>But the greatest strength of the play was the question I came away with: was the attack on Saddam's regime a crucial intervention or an outlet for George Bush's angst over 9/11? If it was the latter and the other players cooperated, then it is tragic. In some respects an informal scene at the Bush ranch, with the president surrounded by his closest advisers, had echoes of Kenneth Branagh's playing of Heidrich at the convivial villa luncheon in Berlin, where the fate of six million Jews was decided in The Final Solution. If this was truly the case regarding Iraq - and the audience and history must decide - then it is an action worthy of Saddam himself. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins recently retired from the army. He was commander of the Royal Irish Battle Group in the invasion of Iraq. </p> <p><strong> Max Hastings</strong><br> Author and journalist </p> <p>This is the thinking person's Fahrenheit 9/11: much more sophisticated, but just as angry. Insofar as the evening has a hero, it is Colin Powell, who says all the sensible things, and loses all the arguments that matter. The most dramatic single moment comes when Donald Rumsfeld delivers an impassioned polemic, urging that America should invade Iraq, and to hell with the Europeans, including Tony Blair. Rumsfeld's words are authentic. They make Anthony Eden in 1956 seem a sensible fellow. </p> <p>Nicholas Farrell does a technically sound Blair, perfect in voice and body language, curiously pitiable even when he orders his staff to prepare the notorious WMD dossier. But then, that might be said of Britain's role since 2002. The play reminded me of all the reasons why I have been apologising to Robin Cook for two years, for doubting his dismissal of WMD. </p> <p>Alex Jennings's Bush did not work for me. The idiotic mannerisms are there, but his president lacks the pigeon-chested gravity and folksy charm which put the man in his job, and seem likely to keep him there. Jennings conveys the featherweight intellect. He makes us laugh. But the menace of Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Cheney (a fabulous Desmond Barrit) dominate the production. </p> <p>The play will reinforce David Hare's reputation as Britain's most effective contemporary dramatist in addressing issues of our time, and providing superb entertainment as well. He has used authentic dialogue, much of it from Bob Woodward's White House book, to show how the US set about implementing what Hare's narrator calls \"the new principle of going to war with anyone you like, because somebody else has attacked you\". </p> <p>Hare tells students of recent history nothing they did not know already, but marshals his evidence superbly. It seems a mistake to perceive what has happened as an \"Iraq crisis\". Iraq is the proximate cause, but this is an ongoing \"America crisis\". It is about how the rest of the world deals with its only superpower. It would be most rash to assume that the future will produce US governments more sensitive to the opinions of allies or bystanders, or even administrations less careless about the abuse of force. </p> <p>If Hare's play has a limitation, it is that we gain no clues as to what we might do better in the future. It is probably absurd to ask such a thing, however. I came away full of admiration for author, director and cast. Why does television do nothing a tenth as good and relevant? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Stuff Happens is at the National until Nov 6, tel 020-7452 3000.</p>",
  "John Kerry last night accused George Bush of being \"unfit to lead\" America and of having shirked the call to defend his country in Vietnam. <p>Mr Kerry's accusations came hours after the president addressed the Republican national convention in New York.</p> <p>In a unprecedented political rebuttal, the Democratic presidential challenger told cheering supporters at a midnight rally in the swing state of Ohio: \"I'm not going to have my commitment to defend this country questioned by those who refused to serve when they could have and by those who have misled the nation into Iraq. Misleading our nation into war in Iraq makes you unfit to lead this country. </p> <p>\"Doing nothing while this nation loses millions of jobs makes you unfit to lead this country. Letting 45 million Americans go without healthcare makes you unfit to lead this country. Letting the Saudi royal family control our energy costs makes you unfit to lead this country.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry's stump speech came after the president questioned his rival's commitment to defend America at the Republican convention in New York and accused him of voting against the money needed for \"bullets and fuel and vehicles and body armour\" for US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p> <p>President Bush's attack, however, was measured compared with assaults on the senator from the vice-president, Dick Cheney, and Zell Miller, a rightwing Democratic senator, on Wednesday evening. Mr Cheney described Mr Kerry as a politician who had repeatedly \"made the wrong call on national security\" while Senator Miller likened him to a \"bowl of mush\".</p> <p>These attacks came after an organisation called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth broadcast a series of adverts questioning Mr Kerry's Vietnam war record. The attacks have left the Democratic campaign struggling to regain the political initiative.</p> <p>This battering appears to have persuaded Mr Kerry to be much more explicit in comparing his war record with that of President Bush, whose posting with the Texas National Air Guard was less dangerous. It has also made Democrats more determined to focus on the economy and jobs, issues on which Mr Kerry has a strong advantage in the opinion polls.</p> <p>In his speech, Mr Kerry accused the president and the Republicans of not talking about the \"real issues\", such as creating jobs, improving the economy, expanding access to healthcare and reducing petrol prices. </p> <p>\"They did everything except talk about that\" at their four-day convention, he said. \"We have had insults; we have had anger from Republicans, and I'll tell you why: because they can't come to you and talk to you about having created jobs, since they have lost them. They can't come to you and talk to you about creating healthcare, since 5 million Americans have lost it. </p> <p>\"Their own labour secretary talks about exporting jobs overseas,\" he added. \"They can't talk about their record because it is a record of failure. And so all they do is attack.\" Mr Kerry will follow his speech with a campaigning bus tour of the swing state of Ohio. Beginning in Dayton, it will take him east through Springfield and arrive in Steubenville on Saturday.</p> <p>President Bush won Ohio by just 3% in 2000, and the state is one of more than a dozen at the centre of the political battle. Mr Kerry's trip there will be his 14th this year, while President Bush has made nearly two dozen visits.</p>",
  "\"Every step you take, I'll be watching you,\" sang the pop trio, The Police, in 1983. Now the real law enforcement agency is using satellite technology to do just that. <p>Officers will keep tabs on paedophiles, domestic abusers and other prolific criminals 24 hours a day, thanks to an innovative tracking scheme launched in three pilot areas in England yesterday. </p> <p>A total of 120 offenders, 40 each in Greater Manchester, Hampshire, and the West Midlands, will be fitted with devices that can pinpoint their position to within two metres. </p> <p>An alert will go off if the offender, given the device as a condition of prison release or alternative to jail, breaches restrictions - for instance, if a child abuser goes near a school playground, if someone with a history of domestic violence approaches a victim's home, or a burglar is out on the prowl. </p> <p>David Blunkett, the home secretary, unveiled the scheme in Manchester, describing it as a \"prison without bars\" that he hoped would cut crime and give the police and probation service a tool with which to protect the public. </p> <p>Devices will be linked to a satellite global positioning system (GPS), backed up in some cases by mobile phone. A step beyond electronic tagging, the device can tell its monitor where an offender is at any given time, displaying their location to within two metres on an Ordnance Survey map. </p> <p>Electronic tags register whether the wearer leaves a designated area - say, breaks a curfew - but cannot show where he or she has gone. </p> <p>GPS has been used to monitor offenders in several US states but this is its first use in Europe. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett has set a target of cutting crime by 15% by 2008. He said: \"The government is determined to be at the cutting edge of technology in the drive to make our communities safer and ensure more effective sentencing of offenders. </p> <p>\"Our sentencing reforms were not just about being tougher on the most serious offenders. This technology will allow us to develop and promote the tough community sentences, which are vital if we are to prevent reoffending and give non-violent offenders a chance to serve an effective sentence in the community.\" </p> <p>The year-long trial costs an average \u00a368 a day per offender. If successful, it will cover up to 5,000 prolific offenders at large in England and Wales, and could even be used in open prisons. </p> <p>Domestic abusers, and prolific offenders such as car thieves, robbers and burglars, and some juveniles, will be among those fitted with the devices; only Manchester will monitor paedophiles. </p> <p>West Midlands and Hampshire will use passive tracking, which records locations retrospectively, downloading data at certain times of day. Manchester will also use hybrid tracking - monitoring offenders in real time to enable police to act quickly if they enter an exclusion zone. </p> <p>Police and probation services were enthusiastic about satellite tracking, which they hope will add an extra layer of intelligence as well as deterring persistent reoffenders and making it easier to protect potential victims. </p> <p>Liam Bradshaw, the assistant chief constable for Essex and a spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: \"All forces are aware of some individuals whose offending levels can inflict misery on local communities. </p> <p>\"Having greater levels of information and intelligence about the movements and behaviour of these individuals will be beneficial in preventing and solving crime and protecting the public.\" </p> <p>Robert Mathers, the chief probation officer for Manchester, said: \"Satellite tracking looks to be a promising tool, particularly in the protection of victims of domestic violence and sex offences.\" </p> <p>Others who work with prisoners and ex-prisoners warned the scheme should not be seen as a catch-all solution. Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers, said: \"This will prove a very expensive resource and therefore must be limited to those offenders that pose the highest risk of harm to the public. </p> <p>\"Satellite tracking is another form of control which, by itself, will not prevent crime. It must be seen as part of a package. It's also critical that it's not used as a substitute for treatment, supervision and surveillance.\" </p> <p>Mark Leech, the founder of the national ex-offenders' charity, Unlock, and editor of Prisons Handbook, said: \"I wish the Home Office would focus more on resettlement needs that actually prevent crime, such as ensuring discharged prisoners have access to housing, employment and financial assistance, rather than gathering evidence and intelligence by tracking which only comes into play once the victim has already suffered.\"</p>",
  "<p>House prices in Britain fell 0.6% in August, said the Halifax bank today, in the latest sign that the property market has come off the boil.</p> <p>It was the first time since December 2002 that Halifax had reported a fall in house prices. Britain's biggest mortgage lender said the rise in interest rates was now acting as a brake on house price growth, a view with which industry analysts concurred. </p> <p>The Bank of England has increased borrowing costs, from their historic lows of 3.5%, five times since November. Interest rates now stand at 4.75% and analysts expect little, if any, further increase.</p> <p>\"With consumer spending also showing signs of moderating in July and August, there is a growing possibility that the Bank of England could leave interest rates unchanged through the rest of this year,\" said Howard Archer of Global Insight.</p> <p>The pound hit a three-month low against the dollar amid expectations that UK interest rates might not need to rise much more. </p> <p>\"House prices have increased by 1.8% during the past three months. This is significantly below the 6.5% rise recorded in the preceding three months, providing further evidence that the housing market is slowing in response to the recent series of interest rate increases,\" said Martin Ellis, chief economist at Halifax.</p> <p>The latest figures are in line with those reported by Nationwide Building Society earlier this week, which showed house price growth had stalled to 0.1% in August, down from a jump of 2.1% in July. </p> <p>They are also consistent with survey evidence from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors which has shown a weakening in both price growth and demand, while the property website Rightmove recently said average asking prices had fallen by more than \u00a31,200 during the last two weeks of August. </p> <p>But Halifax stressed that monthly price falls were part of the normal fluctuations of the market, adding that this was the 10th monthly drop during the past five years, a period in which house prices have more than doubled. </p> <p>Playing down fears of a crash in house prices, Halifax said the market continued to be supported by a strong economy.</p> <p>\"The market remains well underpinned by a strong economic background, historically low debt-servicing costs and supply shortages,\" Mr Ellis said. \"We continue to expect house price inflation to slow gradually over the remainder of 2004 and into next year as higher interest rates and increasing difficulties faced by potential first-time buyers in entering the market curb housing demand.\" </p> <p>Today's data virtually rule out the likelihood of a rise in interest rates when the Bank of England's monetary policy committee meets next week. </p> <p>The MPC has already signalled that interest rates are approaching their peak. If it has managed to cool the property market through its \"gradualist\" policy of interest rate rises, the Bank will have accomplished the rare feat of slowly deflating the bubble in asset prices.</p>",
  "<p>Andrew Marr today reveals it was he who first came up with the plan to turn the Independent into a tabloid but his proposal was turned down by the newspaper's owners six years ago.</p> <p>In a new account of his troubled editorship of the Independent, Marr tells how he came up with a last-ditch plan to downsize the paper to fight the swingeing budget cuts being proposed by its then owners, the Mirror Group.</p> <p>\"In my desperation I decided to counter-attack by redesigning the paper entirely. My first plan was to go tabloid, or preferably 'qualoid' - the intermediate size favoured by the best-looking continental newspapers,\" he reveals.</p> <p>\"But continental-sized presses were not available... as to a tabloid this was quickly vetoed by the management, though six years later, this is just what the next editor, Simon Kelner, did, cleverly producing a tabloid version for London commuters before going tabloid nationally. And so far at least it has worked very well indeed.\"</p> <p>In a new book, My Trade: a Short History of British Journalism, Marr also reveals how he was fired by fax after refusing to implement job cuts he describes as \"completely crazy\", before being rehired just days later by the paper's co-owner, Sir Tony O'Reilly.</p> <p>David Montgomery, the famously combative and cost-cutting former head of the Mirror Group, demanded Marr sack 38 of the newspaper's 43 subeditors, leaving the paper with a production staff of just five.</p> <p>Mr Montgomery, who was forced out in 1999 during merger talks between the Mirror and regional newspaper group Trinity, wanted the Independent's reporters to \"headline their own stories and plonk them, at the right length, straight into ready-designed templates\".</p> <p>When Marr refused, he was sacked. A letter was hand-delivered to his house warning him to \"go home, not to speak to any staff member and not to approach the vicinity of Canary Wharf\" where the Independent was based.</p> <p>The following day he was fired by fax, to be replaced by the former editor of the Independent on Sunday, Rosie Boycott.</p> <p>But in a bizarre twist, days later Marr received a call from Sir Tony saying he wanted to buy the Mirror Group's stake in the Independent and asking him to return as editor-in-chief.</p> <p>\"The oddest part of the arrangement was that he wanted Rosie to stay too,\" he says.</p> <p>\"She would edit the news pages, bringing the elan she had shown in her legalise cannabis campaign, while I would control the editorial pages as 'editor in chief'.\"</p> <p>Marr eventually quit after Boycott was poached by the Daily Express and replaced by the current editor of the Independent, Simon Kelner.</p> <p>He has subsequently admitted that his talents were more suited to political punditry than newspaper editing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<b> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday September 6 2004</b> <br>  The statistics given at the foot of the article may give the impression that the BNP won some council seats in Oldham. In 2002, the BNP came second in four of the five wards it contested and took an average 27%.      Party leaders in Burnley in Lancashire will meet behind closed doors today to try to thrash out an agreement to end a stalemate that has paralysed local politics. <p>The council has no leader and no ruling executive, and has been unable to make any significant decisions beyond who it wants as its representative on the Burnley and Pendle multi-racial playbus. </p> <p>None of this would matter much in most towns, where it would be a small storm in a municipal teacup. But Burnley has six British National party councillors. </p> <p>The story so far: Labour lost overall control of the council at the local elections in June, ending up with 21 seats compared with 24 for the remaining parties. </p> <p>Labour took all nine seats on the executive and limped on as a minority administration. But last week the council was thrown into chaos when the Liberal Democrats staged a coup that could lead to the BNP having its biggest role yet in local government. The Lib Dems managed to overthrow the Labour group with the support of all the other parties - including the BNP - but could not take control with only 11 councillors. </p> <p>Labour leaders charged them with indirectly colluding with the BNP and conducting covert deals. They viewed the episode as a deeply shady alliance, if not a formal coalition. </p> <p>Labour declared itself to be in opposition, but to vote down any of its proposals the other three groups - the Lib Dems, the Conservatives and the independents - would have to rely on BNP support, handing the far-right party significant influence over the council. </p> <p>\"I am incensed,\" said Rafique Malik, a Labour councillor and former mayor. \"The Lib Dems, the Conservatives and the independents have legitimised the BNP's role. Without the BNP's support, they cannot move. They are completely in the hands of the BNP.\" </p> <p>Stuart Caddy, the Labour leader for more than six years, said: \"It's a total disgrace. I had to resign because I cannot work with any BNP member of the council. It's a wrench to give up but it would be against my principles to continue.\" </p> <p>The Lib Dem leader, Gordon Birtwistle, angrily rejected all charges of deals. </p> <p>\"My involvement with the BNP was nil,\" he said. \"I made one phone call to the leader of the BNP before the council meeting out of courtesy to tell him that we were putting a motion to the council. </p> <p>\"The BNP voted for a motion which defeated Labour. They are a totally independent party [whose councillors] vote whichever way they wish. I don't speak to any of them.\" </p> <p>Tempers have cooled. Party leaders have been pressured by the chief executive, Gillian Taylor, to end the stalemate this month. The full council met again this week. The mayor, Margaret Lishman, invited nominations for council leader. No one said a word. Councillors nodded through a few reports, heard talk of progress on dog fouling and litter, and then went home. </p> <p>The Lib Dems will continue to demand a cross-party ruling executive, albeit with fewer councillors, but have said that no BNP councillor will sit on it. </p> <p>\"We are getting there,\" said Mr Birtwistle after the council meeting. \"We have to get there by the end of September. But if Labour hadn't taken their bat and ball away, we wouldn't be in this situation.\" </p> <p>\"I'm saying nothing,\" said the Tory leader, Peter Doyle. \"We are working with the officers to progress the issue. Too many people have already said too much and backed themselves into corners. </p> <p>\"Hopefully no one will say too much to you guys [the media] to cock things up.\" </p> <p>The BNP leader, Len Starr, gave an enigmatic smile as he tied up his shoelace in the council chamber. \"I respectfully suggest you talk to the other party leaders because I don't seem to be involved in this,\" he said. </p> <p>The BNP six have so far made almost no impact. But Mr Starr's comment could be disingenuous: Burnley's new politics may give them a chance to hold a balance of power which the national party leader, Nick Griffin, will be sure to exploit. </p> <p><b>North-west frontier</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The BNP has built a strong base in the north-west and achieved some electoral success. It now has 22 councillors </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The campaign strategy of community politics - as used by the Lib Dems - has yielded success in traditional Labour heartlands such as Oldham, Burnley and Blackburn, the Black Country and West Yorkshire </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> It has more than 80 branches around the country and approximately 5,000 members, treble its 1999 figure </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Though the party has struggled in London, it is advancing into Sunderland, Gateshead and Stoke-on-Trent </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The party was 'bullish' in June 2004, expecting a 'political earthquake', but failed to deliver in European and local elections and no candidate got onto the London assembly or the European parliament - despite 800,000 votes, just under 5% of the national poll.</p>",
  "British Nuclear Fuels is to be allowed to continue releasing a radioactive gas blamed for 100 cancers a year - even though it was first ordered to prevent the pollution 27 years ago. <p>After a decade of trying to enforce the planning condition, the Environment Agency has admitted that by the time BNFL could build a facility to control the Krypton 85 gas, the \u00a31.8bn Thorp reprocessing plant which produces it is likely to have shut. </p> <p>The condition was first imposed in 1977 by Mr Justice Parker when he gave permission for the Thorp plant, as he was concerned about the public health implications of releasing the gas. </p> <p>But when the plant opened in 1994 there was no Krypton 85-trapping equipment and up to 500 cubic metres of the gas have been released daily into the atmosphere at Sellafield ever since. </p> <p>Although the gas is widely dispersed by the wind, government advisers have estimated it causes up to 100 extra cancers a year, two of them fatal. </p> <p>Krypton 85 is one of a number of radioactive byproducts released when spent nuclear fuel is dissolved in acid in order to recover plutonium and uranium. </p> <p>For 10 years BNFL has been locked in a dispute with the Environment Agency over the technical and financial feasibility of capturing the gas on a large scale. </p> <p>While the company admitted it had failed to adhere to the planning condition, it insisted this was because the technology was not available to capture such a large volume of gas. </p> <p>But the agency did not accept this explanation, and instructed the company to develop the technology. </p> <p>Since then, BNFL has repeatedly failed to come up with what it considers to be a safe and reliable method of capturing the gas and the agency has repeatedly refused to accept that the company has done enough to tackle the problem. Some reprocessing plants in other countries have Krypton-capturing equipment, but on a small scale. </p> <p>BNFL said it would cost \u00a3300m to develop the technology to allow large-scale capturing, which would require freezing the gas to extract it. </p> <p>To make it safe, it would then have to be stored under pressure in bottles for 100 years until the radioactivity disappeared. </p> <p>The agency was not convinced by BNFL's argument and appointed independent consultants to investigate. </p> <p>They said it would cost \u00a375m for a capturing plant, and suggested that BNFL could make money from the process by capturing a second and valuable gas called xenon, which is used in car headlights and double glazing. They estimated that sales of xenon could raise \u00a350m a year. </p> <p>The argument has gone on for so long that a lack of new orders for Thorp means that the flagship plant will probably close by 2010, or possibly sooner, although the agency is still operating to a date of 2016. </p> <p>Last night, a spokesman for BNFL accepted that it was possible to capture Krypton, but said it was extremely difficult on the scale required at Sellafield. </p> <p>He said that, apart from the problem of capturing the gas, it was potentially dangerous to workers to store it under pressure for prolonged periods. </p> <p>In its decision document, which comes into force in October, the agency told the company to reconsider the issue, particularly to discover whether the expanding market for xenon would pay for the recovery of Krypton. </p> <p>It has given BNFL another six months to come up with an answer.</p>",

  "<p>So it wasn't about football after all. Sir Clive Woodward has explained his reasons for quitting as England rugby coach, and the crux is his frustration that he could not take his World Cup-winning team forward the way he wanted. </p> <p>Woodward confirmed he will quit rugby union and \"possibly\" move into football after next summer's Lions tour to New Zealand.</p> <p>The 48-year-old, who also confirmed he will work towards earning a coaching badge in soccer, said that since November's last-minute victory over Australia in Sydney he found that his control over England's strategical build-up for the next quadrennial tournament had waned.</p> <p>Woodward was majestic: blunt, lucid, incredibly honest - and not remotely afraid to rub all and sundry up the wrong way.</p> <p>\"It was fantastic to win but it was clear to me from the moment that plane landed [on England's return from the World Cup in Australia] I felt totally out of control,\" he said. \"My mindset was we had a clear plan of how we were being successful and that has been watered down. </p> <p>\"I went into the same meetings with the same face and heard the same things. I wanted more and we have ended up with less. </p> <p>\"When you get into that frame of mind you have to shake hands and agree to disagree. It needs a new person to come in and work within the system who believes in the system. </p> <p>\"I was not prepared to take any compromises any more.\" </p> <p>Woodward claimed some people would say: 'There goes Woody, whinging again', but he added: \"I cannot compromise. Winning is about inches. Look at Kelly Holmes, she won by inches. We won the World Cup by inches. You cannot compromise. </p> <p>\"We prepared properly. But agreements have taken place between the RFU and clubs that on paper look great. They're not in reality.</p> <p>\"I have had these discussions for so long. If I am in a minority of one it doesn't mean to say I am wrong.\" </p> <p>Woodward will oversee the three Tests against the All Blacks on June 25, July 2 and 9 before quitting the sport. </p> <p>\"I am 100% committed to the Lions,\" Woodward said. \"My commitment to them is absolute. I am taking no job from anyone until that is finished.</p> <p>\"The Lions is going to be fantastic. I want to work with the Welsh, the Irish, the Scots. That is what I intend to do. I will be taking up no other employment until then. This season is about the Lions and nothing else.\" </p> <p>As for a \"possible\" move into football, Woodward confirmed he had been talking to Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe but would have to start \"right at the bottom\". He also wants to talk to other clubs about coaching in the game. </p> <p>\"I have applied to do the FA grade two coaching job but I haven't applied for the England job! I am not stupid. You only get put in positions after time. In terms of football I am a million miles off that. </p> <p>\"I think I have a tremendous amount to learn from football. It is a new challenge but I have to start right at the bottom. I'm not sure where I will end up but it is something I am looking forward to. </p> <p>\"I have been talking to Rupert Lowe for a long time. He contacted me a couple of years ago. There have been links between our sport but certainly I'm not involved in anything to do with the first team. </p> <p>\"I've had one or two job offers in other sports and I have learned a lot in this job. </p> <p>\"If there is spare time [building up towards the Lions tour] I will pursue other bits and pieces but I will take no paid position until the tour is over.\" </p> <p>Woodward emphasised he has not been offered a job in football. \"No role has been offered to me,\" he said. \"We are a year away from me moving into the next phase of my career. I intend to do the coaching award and go on from there. </p> <p>\"I might coach Maidenhead under nines! I am not actually looking for a job now. I have a job and I have offers from sport and business, which I may eventually take up.\"</p> <p>Andy Robinson will take over as acting England coach, and Woodward added: \"Robinson should be appointed. He thinks he can work within this compromise but it is right for me to step down if I don't believe I can work within the compromise.\"</p> <p>England skipper Lawrence Dallaglio's decision to retire from international rugby this week was a particular blow to Woodward. Dallaglio was the latest member of the World Cup-winning team - along with captain Martin Johnson - to call it quits because of the amount of rugby being played. </p> <p>\"Where I do stamp my foot a bit is when I see Dallaglio retire,\" he said. \"I don't hear people saying why has he retired? That is where I start to get annoyed.</p> <p>\"You make your point and people aren't listening. Players today are playing too many games. Martin Johnson just could not keep going, it was just too much.</p> <p>\"This is why the team has broken up so quickly. It all caught up with them, their family lives and their bodies. </p> <p>\"Dallaglio has done everything right but he felt he had to stand down. I am very sad about that.\" </p> <p>Woodward's belief that England's elite players are bearing too much of a burden was mentioned by Dallaglio himself as being partially culpable for his decision to retire from international rugby.</p> <p>\"The English season is brutal,\" he said, earlier this week. \"The last few years have been a treadmill which I have been unable to get off, playing game after game after game, whether it's for Wasps or England. </p> <p>\"In the last year I've played 15 Tests. I went right to the last day of the season for Wasps and then 24 hours later had to catch a flight to play for several weeks in New Zealand. There is only so much of that you can take year after year.\"</p>",
  "Mr. Chairman, delegates, fellow citizens: I am honored by your support, and I accept your nomination for President of the United States. <p>When I said those words four years ago, none of us could have envisioned what these years would bring. In the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive on a quiet morning. We saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger. We learned of passengers on a doomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their killers. We have seen a shaken economy rise to its feet. And we have seen Americans in uniform storming mountain strongholds, and charging through sandstorms, and liberating millions, with acts of valor that would make the men of Normandy proud.</p> <p>Since 2001, Americans have been given hills to climb, and found the strength to climb them. Now, because we have made the hard journey, we can see the valley below. Now, because we have faced challenges with resolve, we have historic goals within our reach, and greatness in our future. We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America and nothing will hold us back.</p> <p>In the work we have done, and the work we will do, I am fortunate to have a superb Vice President. I have counted on Dick Cheney's calm and steady judgment in difficult days, and I am honored to have him at my side.</p> <p>I am grateful to share my walk in life with Laura Bush. Americans have come to see the goodness and kindness and strength I first saw 26 years ago, and we love our First Lady.</p> <p>I am a fortunate father of two spirited, intelligent, and lovely young women. I am blessed with a sister and brothers who are also my closest friends. And I will always be the proud and grateful son of George and Barbara Bush.</p> <p>My father served eight years at the side of another great American, Ronald Reagan. His spirit of optimism and goodwill and decency are in this hall, and in our hearts, and will always define our party.</p> <p>Two months from today, voters will make a choice based on the records we have built, the convictions we hold, and the vision that guides us forward. A presidential election is a contest for the future. Tonight I will tell you where I stand, what I believe, and where I will lead this country in the next four years.</p> <p>I believe every child can learn, and every school must teach, so we passed the most important federal education reform in history. Because we acted, children are making sustained progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting better, and nothing will hold us back.</p> <p>I believe we have a moral responsibility to honor America's seniors so I brought Republicans and Democrats together to strengthen Medicare. Now seniors are getting immediate help buying medicine. Soon every senior will be able to get prescription drug coverage, and nothing will hold us back.</p> <p>I believe in the energy and innovative spirit of America's workers, entrepreneurs, farmers, and ranchers so we unleashed that energy with the largest tax relief in a generation. Because we acted, our economy is growing again, and creating jobs, and nothing will hold us back.</p> <p>I believe the most solemn duty of the American president is to protect the American people. If America shows uncertainty and weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. This will not happen on my watch.</p> <p>I am running for President with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world, and a more hopeful America. I am running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that government should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives. I believe this Nation wants steady, consistent, principled leadership and that is why, with your help, we will win this election.</p> <p>The story of America is the story of expanding liberty: an ever-widening circle, constantly growing to reach further and include more. Our Nation's founding commitment is still our deepest commitment: In our world, and here at home, we will extend the frontiers of freedom.</p> <p>The times in which we live and work are changing dramatically. The workers of our parents' generation typically had one job, one skill, one career often with one company that provided health care and a pension. And most of those workers were men. Today, workers change jobs, even careers, many times during their lives, and in one of the most dramatic shifts our society has seen, two-thirds of all Moms also work outside the home.</p> <p>This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn a better living, support your family, and have a rewarding career. And government must take your side. Many of our most fundamental systems - the tax code, health coverage, pension plans, worker training - were created for the world of yesterday, not tomorrow. We will transform these systems so that all citizens are equipped, prepared and thus truly free to make your own choices and pursue your own dreams.</p> <p>My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy. We now compete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods, but new competition for our workers. To create more jobs in America, America must be the best place in the world to do business. To create jobs, my plan will encourage investment and expansion by restraining federal spending, reducing regulation, and making tax relief permanent. To create jobs, we will make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy. To create jobs, we will expand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and services across the globe. And we must protect small business owners and workers from the explosion of frivolous lawsuits that threaten jobs across America.</p> <p>Another drag on our economy is the current tax code, which is a complicated mess filled with special interest loopholes, saddling our people with more than six billion hours of paperwork and headache every year. The American people deserve and our economic future demands a simpler, fairer, pro-growth system. In a new term, I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the federal tax code.</p> <p>Another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the expanding economy to find better, higher-paying jobs. In this time of change, many workers want to go back to school to learn different or higher-level skills. So we will double the number of people served by our principal job training program and increase funding for community colleges. I know that with the right skills, American workers can compete with anyone, anywhere in the world.</p> <p>In this time of change, opportunity in some communities is more distant than in others. To stand with workers in poor communities and those that have lost manufacturing, textile, and other jobs we will create American opportunity zones. In these areas, we'll provide tax relief and other incentives to attract new business, and improve housing and job training to bring hope and work throughout all of America.</p> <p>As I've traveled the country, I've met many workers and small business owners who have told me they are worried they cannot afford health care. More than half of the uninsured are small-business employees and their families. In a new term, we must allow small firms to join together to purchase insurance at the discounts available to big companies. We will offer a tax credit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts, and provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them. These accounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness, the opportunity to save tax-free for routine health expenses, and the freedom of knowing you can take your account with you whenever you change jobs. And we will provide low-income Americans with better access to health care: In a new term, I will ensure every poor county in America has a community or rural health center.</p> <p>As I have traveled our country, I have met too many good doctors, especially OB-GYNS, who are being forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits. To make health care more affordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now. And in all we do to improve health care in America, we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, DC.</p> <p>In this time of change, government must take the side of working families. In a new term, we will change outdated labor laws to offer comp-time and flex-time. Our laws should never stand in the way of a more family-friendly workplace.</p> <p>Another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society, because ownership brings security, and dignity, and independence.</p> <p>Thanks to our policies, homeownership in America is at an all-time high. Tonight we set a new goal: seven million more affordable homes in the next 10 years so more American families will be able to open the door and say welcome to my home.</p> <p>In an ownership society, more people will own their health plans, and have the confidence of owning a piece of their retirement. We will always keep the promise of Social Security for our older workers. With the huge Baby Boom generation approaching retirement, many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether Social Security will be there when they need it. We must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers to save some of their taxes in a personal account - a nest egg you can call your own, and government can never take away.</p> <p>In all these proposals, we seek to provide not just a government program, but a path to greater opportunity, more freedom, and more control over your own life.</p> <p>This path begins with our youngest Americans. To build a more hopeful America, we must help our children reach as far as their vision and character can take them. Tonight, I remind every parent and every teacher, I say to every child: No matter what your circumstance, no matter where you live, your school will be the path to the promise of America.</p> <p>We are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results. We are insisting on accountability, empowering parents and teachers, and making sure that local people are in charge of their schools. By testing every child, we are identifying those who need help and we're providing a record level of funding to get them that help. In northeast Georgia, Gainesville Elementary School is mostly Hispanic and 90 percent poor and this year 90 percent of its students passed state tests in reading and math. The principal expresses the philosophy of his school this way: \"We don't focus on what we can't do at this school; we focus on what we can do; we do whatever it takes to get kids across the finish line.\" This principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, and that is the spirit of our education reform, and the commitment of our country: No dejaremos a ningun ni\u00f1o atras. We will leave no child behind.</p> <p>We are making progress and there is more to do. In this time of change, most new jobs are filled by people with at least two years of college, yet only about one in four students gets there. In our high schools, we will fund early intervention programs to help students at risk. We will place a new focus on math and science. As we make progress, we will require a rigorous exam before graduation. By raising performance in our high schools, and expanding Pell grants for low and middle income families, we will help more Americans start their career with a college diploma.</p> <p>America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand between these children and the health care they need.</p> <p>Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online. The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember: GeorgeWBush.com.</p> <p>These changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity. And here, you face a choice. My opponent's policies are dramatically different from ours. Senator Kerry opposed Medicare reform and health savings accounts. After supporting my education reforms, he now wants to dilute them. He opposes legal and medical liability reform. He opposed reducing the marriage penalty, opposed doubling the child credit, and opposed lowering income taxes for all who pay them. To be fair, there are some things my opponent is for: he's proposed more than two trillion dollars in new federal spending so far, and that's a lot, even for a senator from Massachusetts. To pay for that spending, he is running on a platform of increasing taxes, and that's the kind of promise a politician usually keeps.</p> <p>His policies of tax and spend - of expanding government rather than expanding opportunity - are the policies of the past. We are on the path to the future and we are not turning back.</p> <p>In this world of change, some things do not change: the values we try to live by, the institutions that give our lives meaning and purpose. Our society rests on a foundation of responsibility and character and family commitment.</p> <p>Because family and work are sources of stability and dignity, I support welfare reform that strengthens family and requires work. Because a caring society will value its weakest members, we must make a place for the unborn child. Because religious charities provide a safety net of mercy and compassion, our government must never discriminate against them. Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our society, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges. And I will continue to appoint federal judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law.</p> <p>My opponent recently announced that he is the candidate of \"conservative values,\" which must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters. Now, there are some problems with this claim. If you say the heart and soul of America is found in Hollywood, I'm afraid you are not the candidate of conservative values. If you voted against the bipartisan Defense of Marriage Act, which President Clinton signed, you are not the candidate of conservative values. If you gave a speech, as my opponent did, calling the Reagan presidency eight years of \"moral darkness,\" then you may be a lot of things, but the candidate of conservative values is not one of them.</p> <p>This election will also determine how America responds to the continuing danger of terrorism and you know where I stand. Three days after September 11th, I stood where Americans died, in the ruins of the Twin Towers. Workers in hard hats were shouting to me, \"Whatever it takes.\" A fellow grabbed me by the arm and he said, \"Do not let me down.\" Since that day, I wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent in defending America whatever it takes.</p> <p>So we have fought the terrorists across the earth not for pride, not for power, but because the lives of our citizens are at stake. Our strategy is clear. We have tripled funding for homeland security and trained half a million first responders, because we are determined to protect our homeland. We are transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligence services. We are staying on the offensive striking terrorists abroad so we do not have to face them here at home. And we are working to advance liberty in the broader Middle East, because freedom will bring a future of hope, and the peace we all want. And we will prevail.</p> <p>Our strategy is succeeding. Four years ago, Afghanistan was the home base of al-Qaida, Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups, Saudi Arabia was fertile ground for terrorist fundraising, Libya was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons, Iraq was a gathering threat, and al-Qaida was largely unchallenged as it planned attacks. Today, the government of a free Afghanistan is fighting terror, Pakistan is capturing terrorist leaders, Saudi Arabia is making raids and arrests, Libya is dismantling its weapons programs, the army of a free Iraq is fighting for freedom, and more than three-quarters of al-Qaida's key members and associates have been detained or killed. We have led, many have joined, and America and the world are safer.</p> <p>This progress involved careful diplomacy, clear moral purpose, and some tough decisions. And the toughest came on Iraq. We knew Saddam Hussein's record of aggression and support for terror. We knew his long history of pursuing, even using, weapons of mass destruction. And we know that September 11th requires our country to think differently: We must, and we will, confront threats to America before it is too late.</p> <p>In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat. Members of both political parties, including my opponent and his running mate, saw the threat, and voted to authorize the use of force. We went to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm, or face serious consequences. Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply. After more than a decade of diplomacy, we gave Saddam Hussein another chance, a final chance, to meet his responsibilities to the civilized world. He again refused, and I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the Oval Office - a decision no president would ask for, but must be prepared to make. Do I forget the lessons of September 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defend our country? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time.</p> <p>Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban are history, more than 50 million people have been liberated, and democracy is coming to the broader Middle East. In Afghanistan, terrorists have done everything they can to intimidate people yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the October presidential election - a resounding endorsement of democracy. Despite ongoing acts of violence, Iraq now has a strong Prime Minister, a national council, and national elections are scheduled for January. Our Nation is standing with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq, because when America gives its word, America must keep its word. As importantly, we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our country safer. Free societies in the Middle East will be hopeful societies, which no longer feed resentments and breed violence for export. Free governments in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead of harboring them, and that helps us keep the peace. So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear: We will help new leaders to train their armies, and move toward elections, and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly as possible. And then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned.</p> <p>Our troops know the historic importance of our work. One Army Specialist wrote home: \"We are transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place The various terrorist enemies we are facing in Iraq,\" he continued, \"are really aiming at you back in the United States. This is a test of will for our country. We soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories in confronting the evil terrorists.\"</p> <p>That young man is right - our men and women in uniform are doing a superb job for America. Tonight I want to speak to all of them and to their families: You are involved in a struggle of historic proportion. Because of your service and sacrifice, we are defeating the terrorists where they live and plan, and making America safer. Because of you, women in Afghanistan are no longer shot in a sports stadium. Because of you, the people of Iraq no longer fear being executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, the world is more just and will be more peaceful. We owe you our thanks, and we owe you something more. We will give you all the resources, all the tools, and all the support you need for victory.</p> <p>Again, my opponent and I have different approaches. I proposed, and the Congress overwhelmingly passed, 87 billion dollars in funding needed by our troops doing battle in Afghanistan and Iraq. My opponent and his running mate voted against this money for bullets, and fuel, and vehicles, and body armor. When asked to explain his vote, the Senator said, \"I actually did vote for the 87 billion dollars before I voted against it.\" Then he said he was \"proud\" of that vote. Then, when pressed, he said it was a \"complicated\" matter. There is nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat.</p> <p>Our allies also know the historic importance of our work. About 40 nations stand beside us in Afghanistan, and some 30 in Iraq. And I deeply appreciate the courage and wise counsel of leaders like Prime Minister Howard, and President Kwasniewski, and Prime Minister Berlusconi and, of course, Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p> <p>Again, my opponent takes a different approach. In the midst of war, he has called America's allies, quote, a \"coalition of the coerced and the bribed.\" That would be nations like Great Britain, Poland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, El Salvador, Australia, and others allies that deserve the respect of all Americans, not the scorn of a politician. I respect every soldier, from every country, who serves beside us in the hard work of history. America is grateful, and America will not forget.</p> <p>The people we have freed won't forget either. Not long ago, seven Iraqi men came to see me in the Oval Office. They had \"X\"s branded into their foreheads, and their right hands had been cut off, by Saddam Hussein's secret police, the sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes. During our emotional visit one of the Iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly write out, in Arabic, a prayer for God to bless America. I am proud that our country remains the hope of the oppressed, and the greatest force for good on this earth.</p> <p>Others understand the historic importance of our work. The terrorists know. They know that a vibrant, successful democracy at the heart of the Middle East will discredit their radical ideology of hate. They know that men and women with hope, and purpose, and dignity do not strap bombs on their bodies and kill the innocent. The terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear and they should be afraid, because freedom is on the march.</p> <p>I believe in the transformational power of liberty: The wisest use of American strength is to advance freedom. As the citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq seize the moment, their example will send a message of hope throughout a vital region. Palestinians will hear the message that democracy and reform are within their reach, and so is peace with our good friend Israel. Young women across the Middle East will hear the message that their day of equality and justice is coming. Young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity are found in liberty, not tyranny and terror. Reformers, and political prisoners, and exiles will hear the message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied forever. And as freedom advances heart by heart, and nation by nation, America will be more secure and the world more peaceful.</p> <p>America has done this kind of work before and there have always been doubters. In 1946, 18 months after the fall of Berlin to allied forces, a journalist wrote in the New York Times, \"Germany is a land in an acute stage of economic, political and moral crisis. [European] capitals are frightened. In every [military] headquarters, one meets alarmed officials doing their utmost to deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed.\" End quote. Maybe that same person's still around, writing editorials. Fortunately, we had a resolute president named Truman, who with the American people persevered, knowing that a new democracy at the center of Europe would lead to stability and peace. And because that generation of Americans held firm in the cause of liberty, we live in a better and safer world today.</p> <p>The progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader Middle East will not come easily, or all at once. Yet Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of liberty to transform lives and nations. That power brought settlers on perilous journeys, inspired colonies to rebellion, ended the sin of slavery, and set our Nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century. We were honored to aid the rise of democracy in Germany and Japan and Nicaragua and Central Europe and the Baltics and that noble story goes on. I believe that America is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century. I believe that millions in the Middle East plead in silence for their liberty. I believe that given the chance, they will embrace the most honorable form of government ever devised by man. I believe all these things because freedom is not America's gift to the world, it is the Almighty God's gift to every man and woman in this world.</p> <p>This moment in the life of our country will be remembered. Generations will know if we kept our faith and kept our word. Generations will know if we seized this moment, and used it to build a future of safety and peace. The freedom of many, and the future security of our Nation, now depend on us. And tonight, my fellow Americans, I ask you to stand with me.</p> <p>In the last four years, you and I have come to know each other. Even when we don't agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand. You may have noticed I have a few flaws, too. People sometimes have to correct my English. I knew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing it. Some folks look at me and see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called \"walking.\" Now and then I come across as a little too blunt and for that we can all thank the white-haired lady sitting right up there.</p> <p>One thing I have learned about the presidency is that, whatever shortcomings you have, people are going to notice them and whatever strengths you have, you're going to need them. These four years have brought moments I could not foresee and will not forget. I have tried to comfort Americans who lost the most on September 11th - people who showed me a picture or told me a story, so I would know how much was taken from them. I have learned first-hand that ordering Americans into battle is the hardest decision, even when it is right. I have returned the salute of wounded soldiers, some with a very tough road ahead, who say they were just doing their job. I've held the children of the fallen, who are told their dad or mom is a hero, but would rather just have their dad or mom.</p> <p>And I have met with parents and wives and husbands who have received a folded flag, and said a final goodbye to a soldier they loved. I am awed that so many have used those meetings to say that I am in their prayers to offer encouragement to me. Where does strength like that come from? How can people so burdened with sorrow also feel such pride? It is because they know their loved one was last seen doing good. Because they know that liberty was precious to the one they lost. And in those military families, I have seen the character of a great nation: decent, and idealistic, and strong.</p> <p>The world saw that spirit three miles from here, when the people of this city faced peril together, and lifted a flag over the ruins, and defied the enemy with their courage. My fellow Americans, for as long as our country stands, people will look to the resurrection of New York City and they will say: Here buildings fell, and here a nation rose.</p> <p>We see America's character in our military, which finds a way or makes one. We see it in our veterans, who are supporting military families in their days of worry. We see it in our young people, who have found heroes once again. We see that character in workers and entrepreneurs, who are renewing our economy with their effort and optimism. And all of this has confirmed one belief beyond doubt: Having come this far, our tested and confident Nation can achieve anything.</p> <p>To everything we know there is a season - a time for sadness, a time for struggle, a time for rebuilding. And now we have reached a time for hope. This young century will be liberty's century. By promoting liberty abroad, we will build a safer world. By encouraging liberty at home, we will build a more hopeful America. Like generations before us, we have a calling from beyond the stars to stand for freedom. This is the everlasting dream of America and tonight, in this place, that dream is renewed. Now we go forward grateful for our freedom, faithful to our cause, and confident in the future of the greatest nation on earth.</p> <p>God bless you, and may God continue to bless America.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>BREAKING NEWS</b>: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1296602,00.html\">George Bush last night laid out his case for another term in the White House, claiming only he would keep America safe from a \"drift towards tragedy\" in a world scarred by terrorism</a>.</p> <p><b>SCHOOL SIEGE WEARS ON</b></p> <p>All the papers lead with a picture of a burly Russian special forces officer carrying a young baby to safety from the North Ossetia school where terrorists are holding hundreds of children and adults hostage.</p> <p>The terrorists released 31 women and young children yesterday, but despite the siege entering its third day, they have still refused to accept food and water for the captives. The children have been drinking tap and toilet water, but food had run out, the Telegraph reported. </p> <p>Russian officials say that about 320 hostages remain inside, but the Guardian cites a woman released yesterday who claimed the true figure was 1,020. </p> <p>Anguished relatives fear Russian forces will launch an assault on the school. </p> <p>The Guardian fears that the pro-Russian, Christian Orthodox, well-armed region of North Ossetia will exact its own revenge on its Muslim neighbours in Ingushetia and Chechnya without waiting for Moscow. \"The delicate patchwork of multi-ethnic statelets on Russia's sensitive southern flank could rapidly unravel,\" a leader says. </p> <p>The Times contrasts the horror unfolding in the Russian town of Beslan with the high hopes in France that two journalists held in Iraq will be set free today. Early reports indicated that they may have been handed over to a Sunni opposition group, despite France's refusal to capitulate to the demand that it reverse a law banning headscarves (and other religious symbols) in schools. </p> <p>French Muslims, however, proved themselves unwilling to be dictated to by foreign terrorists, and backed the government even while they disagreed with the headscarf ban. \"The kidnappers had unwittingly succeeded in forging an unprecedented sense of national solidarity in France,\" the Times quotes the French education minister as saying. </p> <p>Several of the papers feature a photograph of a French Muslim schoolgirl experimenting with a wig in place of a headscarf. She looks distinctly uncomfortable with the compromise. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,1296517,00.html\">Amid the savagery of the siege, an act of humanity</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,1296289,00.html\">A terrible lesson from a classroom in Beslan</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/03/wosse103.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/03/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Distressed parents can only hope</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7374-1244339,00.html\">Times: Journalists held in Iraq to be set free</a></p> <p><b>BUSH: PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKES WILL CONTINUE</b></p> <p>Do you remember compassionate conservatism? Well, it's back, and now it has a global agenda. </p> <p>The US, apparently, is going to become \"liberty central\". Thus spake George Bush just before delivering his speech yesterday to the Republican national convention. He went on to tell the assembled minions in New York that he would continue to pursue the \"Bush doctrine\" of striking pre-emptively at enemies before they could strike the US. </p> <p>\"I am running for president with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world, and a more hopeful America. I am running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that the government should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives,\" he said. The Wrap hopes for the sake of all those foreigners about to be affected that the international flavour of compassionate conservatism includes job creation, health care and the eradication of poverty, items noticeably absent from the domestic agenda.</p> <p>The Independent pretty much ignores Bush's speech, instead devoting five pages, including the front, to a list of numbers compiled by Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter. It's designed to prove (cuz numbers are scientific, see?) that Mr Bush has been a horrid failure as president. If you can be bothered to read this interminable list (\"46: percentage increase in sales between 2001 and 2002 of GI Joe figures\"), you will stumble across some gems. (USD10.6m: average wealth of the members of Bush's original 16-person cabinet.) </p> <p>Meanwhile the Telegraph reports that the \"mother of the hanging chad\" - the Palm Beach Country, Florida, election official responsible for selecting the disastrous punchcard ballot for the 2000 presidential election - has been voted out of office. Theresa LePore will, however, still preside over the November election. Surely if they just fling a load of ballots at Hurricane Frances, the result will be every bit as accurate a reflection of the voters' will. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1296500,00.html\">Bush: war on terror will not cease</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=557746\">Independent: Bush by numbers: Four years of double standards</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/03/wus303.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/03/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Mother of the hanging chad deposed</a></p> <p><b>WANT FRIES WITH THAT?</b></p> <p>For all those tired of hearing about how flabby Britain has become, the Sun has discovered a kebab shop in Glasgow that produces the antidote: the Stonner Kebab.

Drivers would be jealous of the usual penalty: a sharp word and a leaflet on safe cycling.</p> <p>Over in Wolverhampton, the council would love a few speedy cyclists.

  "<p>For our children, it's been a long summer. It started with the government's refusal to allow a free vote on \"reasonable chastisement\" in the House of Lords. A so-called compromise amendment was passed, allowing parents to carry on hitting babies and children. The proponent was one of the country's most eminent lawyers, Lord Lester of Herne Hill. (It is a sad reflection of children's low status that a human rights lawyer can make a day's job out of defending parental violence.) </p> <p>Then came the announcement from Charles Clarke that school uniforms are to become compulsory in every state secondary school in order to enforce discipline. And if you think that is uncontroversial, imagine if the Department for Work and Pensions had published a five-year strategy for building the nation's workforce, and had decided that each workplace should introduce a compulsory uniform. Yet there was no objection to the school uniform proposal, except from children themselves. </p> <p>And so the summer went on, with British children being treated again and again as political playthings, their civil rights being chipped away bit by bit, and no politician raising any serious objections. Following the announcement that Anti-Social Behaviour Orders experts are to be parachuted into local authorities to make them tougher on \"yobs\", things can only get worse. </p> <p>The attack on children's civil rights will soon be tested in the courts. With support from Liberty, a 14-year-old London boy is claiming that his right to freedom of movement and assembly is being violated since the police introduced a blanket curfew on under-16s in the centre of Richmond. The no-go area includes the local cinema. </p> <p>Jack Straw dreamed up curfews when he was home secretary. They were established in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, and initially aimed at the under-10s. Not one local authority introduced a curfew. That's not surprising: legislation already existed to remove vulnerable children from the street (or anywhere else) and take them to a place of safety. </p> <p>In 2001 the age range was extended to under-16s, to encourage local authorities to use them. Then the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 gave the police the power to disperse groups of two or more people. How quickly that caught on! Towns and cities up and down the country welcomed the summer by closing off public areas to children. The Metropolitan police has blocked off the whole of the West End to children not in the company of an adult after 9pm. I did a radio interview and was asked why the streets shouldn't be kept clear for ordinary people to get on with their lives. I replied that children are ordinary people. </p> <p>To an unknowing public, it would seem that the Home Office is now in charge of children's policy. The systems set up to protect and promote children's welfare are kept in the closet while macho initiatives are paraded. Since June 2000, 82 children aged 12 and under have been given Asbos. Have we nothing more to offer these children? </p> <p>Children subject to Asbos are, as a matter of course, \"named and shamed\"; social pillorying is part and parcel of the technique. This comes from the same political party that rejected the 11-plus examination because of the stigma and long-term harm it inflicted on growing children. </p> <p>These kind of initiatives make the government's proposed database of all children very worrying. It argues that such a database would ensure every child gets access to universal services. But there has been little scrutiny of the database plans, and the public is largely ignorant of what lies ahead. By contrast, David Blunkett's proposals for a national ID card have been scrutinised by the home affairs select committee, the human rights committee and by cabinet. There were two official consultation documents. The card scheme will get its own legislation, whereas the children's database gets one clause in the children bill. Peers strongly criticised the plans, and there have been some concessions, but the scheme is going ahead despite the civil rights implications for both children and parents. </p> <p>Children are soft targets and easy political prey. A bit like prisoners, they are disenfranchised, nobody really takes them seriously, and rehabilitation is a long and hard journey. To be respected as real people, children have to shed their childhood skin and become adults. </p> <p>Politicians will soon return from the summer break. Before they plunge back into their jobs, they might like to consider the extent to which our country is in breach of children's human rights. My organisation would happily give each and every one a copy of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UN human rights treaty that spells out what countries must do under international law to respect children and their human rights. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Carolyne Willow is national coordinator of the Children's Rights Alliance for England<br></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:cwillow@crae.org.uk\">cwillow@crae.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The medicines watchdog is investigating whether criminals are trying to break into the official supply chain for prescription drugs after the discovery of a second fake product in 10 days. </p> <p>Thousands of patients are already being advised by manufacturers to check that they are taking genuine medicines. Such threats to the safety of patients and effectiveness of treatments could undermine public confidence. </p> <p>The warning came after a suspicious wholesaler noticed an unusual batch number, leading to the discovery of counterfeit anti-obesity tablets claiming to be Reductil. Last month a patient in Cheshire spotted fake versions of Cialis, which helps men maintain erections. </p> <p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is trying to find out whether there is a link between the two cases. </p> <p>Although officials believe there is no immediate safety risk to patients, they want to trace any counterfeits because the drugs might not be so effective medically. </p> <p>Any serious breach of the integrity of distribution chains, including the makers, wholesalers, and retail pharmacies, would raise concern not only about patient risk; it would also amount to serious fraud. </p> <p>Investigators hope these are isolated instances. </p> <p>A fake batch of a drug used to treat peptic ulcers and stomach acid was uncovered in 1994 but the perpetrators were never found. </p> <p>Fakers of drugs could try to undercut the price of the genuine article, and companies are also pointing to huge research and development costs being put at risk. </p> <p>Reductil has been used by about 130,000 patients in Britain since it came on the market in May 2001. The fake 15mg blue-and-white capsules were sold as part of a batch numbered 65542, while the genuine medicines made by Abbott Laboratories always had a number with a one-letter suffix. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Abbott said the firm regarded any \"counterfeiting of medicines very seriously\". She added: \"Patients should talk to their doctor to ensure they are taking genuine Abbott Reductil.\" </p> <p>Kent Woods, the chief executive of the MHRA, said: \"Although the safety of counterfeit medicines cannot be guaranteed, there is no indication from testing of the counterfeit product that it poses an immediate risk to patients. If patients have any concerns about possible side effects they should consult a doctor.\"</p>",

  "<p>Hopes for an early release of two French journalists held by Islamist militants in Iraq rose dramatically last night when the editor of Le Figaro newspaper said he had been told the pair had been handed over to another group that favoured freeing them. Jean de Belot said the news was \"certainly positive\" but warned against excessive optimism. </p> <p>\"The latest information is that Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot have been handed over by the Islamic Army in Iraq to an Iraqi Sunni guerrilla group,\" he said. \"This is an opposition group that we have known for a few days now has been in favour of the release of the hostages,\" </p> <p>He said some reports indicated the men might be freed this morning if the group now holding them received unspecified guarantees. \"Until the good news has actually arrived, we cannot allow ourselves to be absolutely reassured,\" he said. </p> <p>The French foreign ministry could not immediately confirm the news but the foreign minister, Michel Barnier, said in Amman, Jordan, that the two men were \"alive, in good health and well treated\". </p> <p>A ministry spokesman said the government was now \"reasonably hopeful\" that the men would be released but \"could not be in the least sure when\". </p> <p>The interior minister, Dominique de Villepin, said signs were \"pointing in the right direction\", but advised \"the greatest possible prudence\". He told French television: \"Tomorrow is the day of prayer. Friday is a great moment of coming together, and meditation, I would like to believe that we could hope for a happy outcome.\" </p> <p>Earlier yesterday a Muslim delegation from France trying to secure the release of the two journalists, correspondents for Le Figaro and Radio France Internationale, said it was satisfied the men were still alive and well. </p> <p>\"We have received proof that they are alive and well. We are optimistic and confident they will be released soon,\" said Mohamed Bichari, the vice-president of France's Muslim French Council (CFCM), after a meeting in Baghdad with the influential Muslim Clerics' Association. </p> <p>Chesnot, 37, and Malbrunot, 41, vanished on August 19 on their way to Najaf. The Islamic Army of Iraq said last weekend that it was holding them and demanded France withdraw its law banning conspicuous symbols of religious faith, including Muslim headscarves, from state schools. </p> <p>Amid intense diplomatic activity by Paris, which has succeeded in winning unprecedented support from much of the Arab and Muslim world, the group's deadline passed on Wednesday night and the law came into effect yesterday at the start of the school year. </p> <p>The delegation from France's main Islamic umbrella group met different religious leaders in Iraq yesterday and appealed for the pair's release. \"We launch a solemn appeal,\" said Abdallah Zekri, representing the Paris mosque. \"In the name of Allah and of the Koran we demand the hostages' liberation. Show us that you are Muslims like us.\" </p> <p>Another Iraqi militant group, Tawhid and Jihad, announced it had executed three Turkish truck drivers it had been holding hostage. The Arabic TV channel Al- Jazeera said it had received a video showing the men's deaths. </p> <p>The drivers' execution comes after the release on Wednesday of seven other foreign truck drivers held hostage for more than a month. </p> <p>Elsewhere in Iraq, Sunni militants assassinated a leading supporter of Moqtada al-Sadr, the radical cleric whose militia staged last month's uprising in Najaf. Sayed Bashir al-Jazayeri was travelling through Latifiya in an armed convoy yesterday when gunmen sprayed his Mercedes with bullets. </p> <p>In Falluja, angry crowds denounced the United States as they mourned the 17 victims, including three children, of a US airstrike on a house allegedly used by militants.</p>",
  "<p>A string of private equity groups are running the rule over Big Brother producer Endemol in anticipation of its owner, Spanish telecoms group Telefonica, firing the starting gun on a \u00a31bn-plus auction process. </p> <p>Venture capital groups including 3i, Apax, Candover and Cinven are believed to be looking seriously at bidding for Endemol, the independent production giant that has operations in 21 countries and makes shows including Big Brother, Fame Academy and Restoration. </p> <p>Telefonica bought the company for \u00a33.5bn in 2000 at the height of the dotcom boom, when the convergence of delivery and content was all the rage.</p> <p>But it has since indicated that it does not see it as a core operation and would be willing to sell it on or float it. </p> <p>Apax, 3i, Candover and Cinven all have money to invest as confidence begins to return to the market. Apax looked at the possibility of buying ITV companies Carlton and Granada before they were merged, and all four were involved in the auction for the Telegraph Group, which was eventually sold to private buyers, the Barclay brothers, for \u00a3690m. </p> <p>3i was closest to triumphing in the race for the Telegraph titles after its bid, headed by former Trinity Mirror chief David Montgomery, made it to the final three bidders. But ultimately, it couldn't match the premium paid by the Barclays. </p> <p>However, all of the potentially interested parties - which could also include US private equity groups and broadcasters - are waiting for Telefonica officially to put Endemol up for sale, a move they expect to happen within the next year. </p> <p>Sources in the private equity fraternity believe that Telefonica will conduct a formal auction process in an effort to realise as much value as possible, rather than agreeing to a straight management buyout or IPO. </p> <p>Along with RTL-owned Fremantle, Endemol is one of very few truly global independent producers able to sell its own formats across multiple territories and leverage the interactive and merchandising rights that are expected to become more important as the industry evolves. \"It's got critical mass and a global presence,\" said one City source. </p> <p>For that reason, private equity buyers would prefer to buy the company as a whole rather than seeing it broken up into its constituent parts. </p> <p>While they would consider a management buyout, a prospect raised recently by Endemol's UK chief executive, Peter Bazalgette, they would prefer a straight cash deal rather than dealing with the \"egos and complications\" involved in handing the company over to management. </p> <p>He confirmed that senior managers in Endemol's key markets - including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK and the US - were looking at their options for jointly buying the business. These options could include a management buyout or an initial public offering. </p> <p>Another potential stumbling block for would-be buyers is the large earn-out clauses that would be due to senior management at the various international subsidiaries under the terms of the original deal between Telefonica and founders John de Mol and Joop van den Ende. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>For a long time the wonder about Barbara Amiel was how she could stay so sexy, so young, so vibrant, while maintaining her position as one of the most forthright columnists in British newspapers. </p> <p>She was the scourge of the left and the darling of the right - a powerful woman lusted after by powerful men - and she snared one of the most powerful when she married Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon and then owner of the Telegraph group, in July 1992. </p> <p>That marriage, her fourth, brought everything she yearned for: extreme wealth, a new column in the Daily Telegraph, a title and access to the high society she adored. </p> <p>As George Bloomfield, a former lover, said at the time: \"She is at the centre of the world she always wanted. The world of words. And she's living with the man who OWNS it.\" </p> <p>Today those who once admired Lady Black are wondering why all of that was apparently not enough. </p> <p>\"The most extraordinary thing about this whole affair is that it seems so unnecessary,\" said a close acquaintance. \"They had a wonderful life, plenty of money [and] they wanted to compete with the mega-rich in America.\" </p> <p>The extent to which Amiel, rightwing thinker, columnist, beauty and society hostess, is claimed to have benefited from the alleged wholesale looting of Hollinger International's finances was set out this week in a 500-page report by a special committee established to investigate the affair. </p> <p>One of the reasons the money was needed, the report said, was to \"satisfy the liquidity needs arising for the personal lifestyle Black and his wife had chosen to lead\". </p> <p>These choices included the purchase or lease of two corporate jets, a $530,000 (\u00a3295,000) holiday in French Polynesia, a $2,463 handbag, exercise equipment at $2,083, opera tickets for $2,785, a \"birthday party for Barbara\" at New York's La Grenouille restaurant costing $42,870, contributions to the salaries of a chef, senior butler, guard and chauffeurs at their homes in London, New York and Florida, perfume, food, shopping trips for Amiel and cash for tips on such shopping trips. </p> <p>Such apparent conspicuous consumption is all a long way from Amiel's beginnings, charted in her autobiography, Confessions. Born in Watford in 1940, she was eight when her parents divorced after her father left for another woman. Her mother remarried, moved the family to Canada and settled in Hamilton, Ontario. When her stepfather had trouble finding a job, however, relationships at home became rocky, and at 14 Amiel struck out on her own. </p> <p>A year later her natural father killed himself back in Britain. </p> <p>Her troubled background is cited by many as a reason for her toughness today. Renting rooms, she supported herself with low-paying jobs while attending school. She attended college but became addicted to codeine, and later to antidepressants, only kicking the habit when she met her second husband George Jonas, a Canadian writer. </p> <p>Journalistically she started out at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, but made her name as a rightwing columnist in a mostly liberal country. In 1983 she was chosen as the first female editor of the Toronto Sun, which announced her as \"beauteous and brainy, rightwing and right on\". </p> <p>On her third marriage to a cable TV executive she moved to London and continued expounding her views in the Times until she met and married Black. </p> <p>It is Amiel's combination of intelligence, beauty and sex appeal - which she uses as a form of direct action - which has contributed to her success both in society circles and professionally. \"If she sits next to someone at dinner and she decides she wants to please, there's no one more brilliant than her,\" said one hapless man. </p> <p>\"She fixes those great green eyes on you and the rest is history. It is an amazing performance.\" </p> <p>Many of her friends cite female rivalry as a reason for much of the criticism of 63-year old Amiel. </p> <p>\"It is women who label her a man's woman, the subtext is that she is drop-dead gorgeous, \" said Andrew Roberts, the rightwing historian and close friend of Amiel. </p> <p>\"She is fiercely attractive, she is as sexy as hell and she presumably knows it. I certainly know it.\" </p> <p>But while that fierce intelligence is remarked upon by many, it fuels extreme views which are propounded with a frequency bordering on the obsessional - something which many believe undermines her journalism. </p> <p>Like many of today's rightwing commentators, she briefly flirted with communism as a student, but later as a non-religious Jew enthusiastically adopted trenchantly pro-Israel, pro-American, Eurosceptic views, and promoted her belief that homosexuality is an abomination. </p> <p>With Black in control of the Telegraph group, she had a lofty platform from which to shout, and complete control of the contents of her musings. It was a brave departmental editor who spiked a column, but it did happen on occasions when an editor of the day was faced with a rant too far against the BBC. </p> <p>As the couple's status rose, so did their social ambition. In 2001 Black accepted British citizenship and a peerage, and the creature that is Lady Black was born. </p> <p>She played the hostess at huge parties in their mansion in Kensington. Some blame Amiel for constantly pushing the boundaries of extravagance. </p> <p>One anecdote told about her is that, after a visit to the movies she remarked that she would never go to a public cinema again. \"All those smelly people.\" </p> <p>Similarly after being delayed on a flight from New York, she stated it was her final journey on a public jet. </p> <p>On a trip to Canada to inspect the National Post newspaper, which was launched by her husband, she had barely stepped out of a taxi when the mission was diverted. </p> <p>\"Let's go shopping,\" she said to a companion. When inside the store she was seen to sweep up everything, like some sort of shopaholic, an observer remarked. </p> <p>In 2002 Vogue was invited into her London mansion where the reporter noted \"a fur closet, a sweater closet, a closet for shirts and T-shirts and a closet so crammed with evening gowns that the overflow has to be kept in yet more closets downstairs\". </p> <p>And there was more - a dozen Herm\u00e8s Birkin bags, 30 or 40 handbags made by Renaud Pellegrino, and more than 100 pairs of Manolo Blahnik shoes. </p> <p>Amiel attributes her need for all this to a slight she suffered as a penniless teenager, when the mother of the boy she was dating made fun of her outfit. \"I sort of never forgot it. And now I have an extravagance that knows no bounds.\" That quote has been widely repeated, but friends say it is nothing more than endearing self satire. </p> <p>It was perhaps not so endearing when read by staff at the Telegraph group who in the same year had a pay freeze imposed upon them by Lord Black. </p> <p>\"We are shocked by all of this,\" said one staff member. If true, he said, it seemed extraordinary \"when you remember them telling us we couldn't have a pay rise\". </p> <p>Whether self-aware or not, her extravagance does not stop at clothes. Amiel is as obsessed with jewellery, blaming her love of diamonds and pearls on her marriage to Black which moved her into social circles where jewels are a \"defining attitude, rather like your intelligence\". </p> <p>\"It's one thing to make a mistake with a wrong choice from Prada, but quite another to buy the wrong piece from Graff or SJ Phillips.\" </p> <p>Already in 2001 questions were being asked about the couple living beyond their means. Margaret Wente, a columnist on the Globe and Mail in Canada and a friend of Amiel's summed the suspicions up. \"Only a few hundred women in the world can afford to dress like Mrs Black, and Mrs Black may not be among them.\" </p> <p>Today friends say Amiel is feeling \"crushed\" by the weight of the problems mounting against her. </p> <p>Hollinger International, which recently sold the Telegraph Group, has begun legal action in Illinois against the couple and other executives, seeking $1.25bn in damages. Criminal fraud charges could also be laid. But her close circle of friends is fiercely defensive of her. </p> <p>\"She exists in the highest society that there is,\" said Mr Roberts. \"She still exists in that society, the stories that she's been cut off in some way, knifed by people, are complete rubbish. </p> <p>\"If she is not going out as much, that is simply because she doesn't want to be somewhere there are innumerate hacks.\" </p> <p>Amiel is not feeling sorry for herself, her friends state. Instead, with the attitude of a fighter, she is ensuring her survival. Already she has begun writing again, penning a typically robust comment piece in the Sunday Times a fortnight ago. </p> <p><strong>Life in short</strong></p> <p><strong>Born</strong> December 4 1940 in Watford.

  "<p>A giant flower which emits a nauseating stench of rotting flesh when in full bloom began to open in Cambridge yesterday, botanists said. </p> <p>After days of anxious waiting, the 1.6m (5ft) high Titan Arum, which boasts the largest flower stalk in the world, began to burst into bloom. </p> <p>The plant has been cultivated at Cambridge University's Botanic Garden for the past 20 years but for the last few days it has been growing at a rate of 8-10cm a day. </p> <p>Famed for its size and rare flowering, the blood-red flower is also renowned for its hideous smell which is said to be a cross between burnt sugar and rotting flesh. The plant is so pungent it is known as the \"corpse flower\" by Indonesians in its native Sumatra. </p> <p>Glasshouse supervisor Rob Brett said the atrocious smell attracts the carrion beetles and blow flies that pollinate the flower. </p> <p>However he is confident the smell will not put people off trying to catch a glimpse and a sniff of the flower. </p> <p>\"Over the bank holiday we had a 50% increase in the number of visitors,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It's such a rare occurrence. It has only bloomed a few times in this country before and it's a first for Cambridge.\" </p> <p>There are also some specimens at Kew where it first flowered in 1889, exciting great public interest. In 1926, when it flowered again, the crowds were so large that the police were called to control them. </p> <p>The plant has a central towering spike surrounded by a crimson frill which over the next two days or so will open out like an upturned umbrella to more than one metre wide. </p> <p>The whole event is being broadcast on a live webcam so people can enjoy the sight wherever they are located.

  "A date France had feared for months passed without serious incident as more than 12 million pupils returned to school - and only a handful defied the ban on Islamic headscarves that became law yesterday. <p>An education ministry spokesman said the return had been \"extremely calm\" and \"hardly any\" headteachers had reported problems. </p> <p>The law outlaws the wearing in state schools of all conspicuous signs of faith but is considered to be aimed at Muslim girls' headgear. Commentators said that, paradoxically, the declared intention of many pupils to flout the ban melted in the shock at the kidnapping of two French journalists by Iraqi militants who demanded it be revoked. </p> <p>Muslims who campaigned fiercely earlier this year made no attempt to organise resistance. Schools in suburbs of Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille that had reported dozens of headscarves last year saw few or none yesterday. </p> <p>\"We're telling girls not to defy the state,\" said Fouad Alaoui of the Union of French Islamic Organisations, before leaving for Baghdad to try to free the hostages. \"They should make their schooling the priority.\" </p> <p>Some girls arrived at school in headscarves but then took them off. \"I'll take it off when I get inside,\" Mounana Ouliat told reporters as she walked toward her Marseille lyc\u00e9e. \"I have to get an education.\" </p> <p>At a school outside Lille, one girl, Asma, said the law was unfair but she would remove her scarf. \"It will feel bizarre, wrong even, but I have no choice,\" she said. \"If I want to become someone in this society I have to pass exams.\" One school north of Paris that last year had 52 pupils with headscarves had none yesterday. </p> <p>The education minister Francois Fillon had ruled that all girls would be admitted on the first day of term, but those who defied the ban would be invited for a \"dialogue\" that could last more than a week; only then would refuseniks face expulsion. </p> <p>The only city to report a protest was Strasbourg. At the Marc Bloch lyc\u00e9e, four girls were placed in a classroom alone and told discussions on their future would begin next week, a pupil said. </p> <p>The law enjoys broad support in France, where it is seen as the best guarantee of equality and freedom for all.

  "Campaigning for England's first regional devolution referendum began yesterday with a glitzy launch in Durham city and an opinion poll showing relatively strong support for an elected assembly in the north-east. <p>But rolling out a string of supporting personalities, from the former Olympic athlete and commentator Brendan Foster, to the president of Newcastle United, Sir John Hall, the group Yes 4 the North East acknowledged that many electors were unsure of their views two months before the all-postal ballot. </p> <p>Yesterday's ICM poll for the group, among 1,000 electors in the north-east, found that while 48% would back an assembly - one broadly similar to the Greater London Authority - 27% were against it. But the 25% undecided will determine the outcome of the November 4 referendum. </p> <p>Guests packed into Durham's town hall, which could provide the home for a 25-member assembly, to the sound of the Manchester band M People reinforcing the slogan \"Vote for the North East - be proud, be positive\". </p> <p>Mr Foster told the audience that the north-east needed a strong voice to counter the centralist tendencies of the government and the growing strength of London and the south-east. \"There is no strategy for the region,\" he said. \"I am sure the north-east wants to control its own destiny. This is make or break, a once in a lifetime opportunity.\" </p> <p>In July, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, who has campaigned for England's devolution, postponed the plans for referendums in the north-west and Yorkshire. This came after pressure from Downing Street following a rebellion by backbench Labour MPs who claimed referendums would be a damaging distraction for the government seven months before a likely general election. But the north-east, less marginal than the other regions, was considered to be a safer bet. </p> <p>Today marks the deadline for organisations, such as Yes 4 the North East, to apply to the Electoral Commission for designation as official campaign groups, each eligible for \u00a3100,000 of public funds. While only one yes campaign has emerged, the commission needs to decide between two no campaigns. One is led by the Sunderland \"metric martyr\" Neil Herron, and the other is funded largely by the old north-east establishment and veteran businessmen, including the former transport magnate Sir Tom Cowie. </p> <p>The commission will make a final decision around September 14 when groups will be reminded that spending will be capped at \u00a3665,000 - if they can raise that much cash - including the \u00a3100,000 public grant. </p> <p>In addition, political parties will face spending caps based on their share of the vote in the last local elections in the north-east. Labour and the Liberal Democrats, which will both campaign for a yes vote, will be allowed to spend no more than \u00a3665,000 and \u00a3400,000 respectively, while the Tories and the UK Independence party, in the no camp, will be capped at \u00a3400,000 each. </p> <p>To further complicate the process, individuals too can register with the commission and will be able to spend up to \u00a3100,000 each. This has raised fears among commission officials that wealthy individuals will be able to exploit the process by spreading money around sympathisers while remaining anonymous.</p>",
  "<p>A Swiss group has helped 22 Britons get round a UK ban on euthanasia over the last two years, the sister of one of them said yesterday. </p> <p>Dignitas, based in Zurich, was previously thought to have helped only five Britons die in the face of extreme suffering. </p> <p>Dignitas has 557 members in the UK, according to Lesley Close, whose brother John suffered from motor neurone disease and was the fifth Briton helped to die by the group. She revealed that the controversial organisation had helped 22 Britons take their own lives. </p> <p>The organisation, founded in 1998 to help people with chronic diseases \"die with dignity\", was first noticed in the UK when it helped Reg Crew to die in January 2003. </p> <p>Mr Crew was the second Briton to be helped by Dignitas which has assisted the suicides of 304 people, around two thirds of them from outside Switzerland. </p> <p>Ms Close said: \"The disproportionate interest shown by UK citizens is clear from the membership figures as well as the number of deaths. </p> <p>\"This does not reflect a unique British position: it reflects the fact that Reg Crew's bravery in going public with his journey to Zurich opened a door which showed ordinary people with terminal illnesses - people like my brother - that there was a way to end their suffering with dignity.\" </p> <p>There have been no prosecutions in the UK of their relatives who travelled with them. \"It's supposed to be a criminal offence but they don't want to do anything about it,\" said Ms Close. \"It's hypocritical for the authorities to condemn but take no action ... We shouldn't have to go to Zurich to do it.\" </p> <p>Dignitas founder Ludwig Minelli said he does not talk to the British press, whom he considers unfair, but did say: \"These pro-life people are crazy, they do not care for life, they care for dogmas.\" </p> <p>Swiss authorities are considering making foreigners wait six months before they can use Dignitas, in an attempt to stop \"suicide tourism\". </p> <p>Jill Gerhardi, of the anti-euthanasia group Alert and who suffers from cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis, said the figure of 22 Britons showed the system was failing. \"It is appalling. They should be increasing help and hope that there is a lot of life to live.\" </p> <p>One couple, Robert and Jennifer Stokes, who killed themselves at Dignitas earlier this year, were not terminally ill. </p> <p>They had suffered from mental illness and chronic diseases and were in constant pain. An inquest heard they died rather than be apart, though their son called them \"attention seekers\". </p> <p>Mark Slattery of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society said: \"The British law is less liberal and more restrictive than other western European countries. That means we are more likely to seek assistance overseas.\" </p> <p>He said in the Crew case the Crown Prosecution Service took eight months to make a decision on whether to prosecute and called on the director of public prosecutions to issue new guidance. </p> <p>\"It's a significant burden when you are grieving for someone, if you come back from Switzerland or wherever and you don't know if you'll face charges or not,\" he said. </p> <p>Yesterday a survey commissioned by the Voluntary Euthanasia Society found that 50% of people would consider going abroad to receive medical assistance to die if they were suffering unbearably from a terminal illness. </p> <p>A CPS spokesman said there were no plans to issue new guidance and that there were no planned prosecutions of anyone who had helped people to die abroad.</p>",
  "Victims of miscarriages of justice have helped set up a network to enable academics, lawyers and those wrongly accused of crimes in the past to research cases of prisoners who say they have been falsely convicted. <p>Criminals who have exhausted their appeals process will be able to ask the organisation - known as the Innocence Network UK - to review their cases. Lawyers and activists will see whether there are any new grounds which could be put before the Criminal Cases Review Commission. </p> <p>The Lord Chancellor's Department statistics show that since 1985 more than 85,000 verdicts have been overturned on appeal. </p> <p>Those involved in establishing the network, which will be initially based at Bristol University, include Paddy Hill, who was freed in 1991 after being wrongly convicted of the Birmingham 1974 pub bombings that killed 21, and Michael O'Brien, one of three men known as the Cardiff Three, who were wrongly jailed for the killing of Philip Saunders in 1987. Also involved in the network is Robert Brown, who was freed on appeal after 25 years in prison for the murder of Annie Walsh in 1977, and the broadcaster and author Sir Ludovic Kennedy. </p> <p>Similar organisations have been set up in Australia and the US. A state-based network, known as the Innocence Panel, was set up in Sydney to enable prisoners to prove their innocence through DNA. </p> <p>However, the New South Wales police minister, John Watkins, suspended the panel last year, saying insufficient checks and balances were in place to stop victims of crime suffering further anguish. </p> <p>But Dr Michael Naughton, a criminal law lecturer at Bristol University who is involved with the UK network, said yesterday that the justice system could not cope with the volume of people asserting they have been wrongly jailed.</p>",
  "Where there's a will there's a way. I think of the adage whenever I hear of some \"foolproof\" technology to stop criminals circumventing the law. Yesterday certainly stands out. Satellite tracking pinpoints, we are told, a miscreant's position to within two metres. Very impressive. But will it do the job? <p>I've never been tagged. Never had a non-custodial sentence for that matter. </p> <p>So I rang a few young scallies subjected to the ankle bracelet routine (the previous technology, which told if someone had left their home in breach of a curfew order) and asked them for the latest gen on beating the system. Could they find a way around GPS, or would they finally admit defeat? </p> <p>I wasn't the least surprised to learn there is a way to beat GPS. Several in fact. It would not be in the public interest to reveal them. Suffice to say at least two sounded cunning in the extreme; another sounded far too extreme to be remotely cunning. </p> <p>Security measures are invariably criminal-led, a response to villains having found a way around the previous \"foolproof\" system. </p> <p>It's always been that way, in my experience. When I started screwing commercial premises, fulltime, in 1962, alarms were practically non-existent. Security was on the perceived points of entry. Strong bolts, steel doors, and shutters persuaded the brethren to take to the roofs to save time and trouble. </p> <p>Even when the early alarms appeared, they were merely \"clangers\" that stopped when ripped from the wall and plunged in a bucket of water. </p> <p>They brought in bells that were difficult to remove. So we drilled and filled 'em with foam used on cavity walls. Then came a dirty trick: monitored systems, run off phone lines. If you made an entry or cut the line, you broke the constant signal telling the monitors all was well. So the brethren's boffins devised a \"loop\" you would attach before doing the business. Their signal was replaced by yours. Eventually, however, the signals became too complex for even the most clued-up of bellmen. Now, even the cheapest systems are hard to beat. </p> <p>But beaten they will be, just as David Blunkett's satellite tracking will be beaten. </p> <p>Where there's a will ... </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Eric Allison was a career criminal for nearly 40 years until his release in 1990.

  "<p>The founder and chairman of sofa chain DFS last night slapped down an extra \u00a311m in his effort to buy back the firm, increasing his controversial bid by 10p a share. </p> <p>Lord Kirkham, who had been staring at defeat in his plan to regain control of the company he started more than 30 years ago, is now offering \u00a3507m for the 67-store chain. The new price is \u00a345m more than his initial bid of 415p a share. </p> <p>The increased offer was made just before a deadline for investors to accept Lord Kirkham's terms. It also comes just a few days after the company's three non-executive directors, led by former Halifax boss Mike Blackburn, said they might resign if shareholders failed to follow their recommendation and accept the chairman's offer. Last night they recommended the new terms. </p> <p>Lord Kirkham is attempting to take control using a scheme of arrangement - which is quicker and cheaper than a traditional takeover but requires 75% approval from shareholders. </p> <p>The chairman had given warning that the outlook for DFS as a quoted company was poor and urged shareholders to sell out. To exert additional pressure Lord Kirkham, who is seen as the linchpin of the business, has refused to commit to staying with DFS after he turns 60 later this year. </p> <p>Nevertheless, investors led by Morley Fund Management and M&amp;G, which together own some 15% of DFS, had made clear that they were unimpressed with the offer price and were ready to rebuff the chairman and watch the non-executives quit. Mr Blackburn met hedge fund managers in London on Wednesday to urge them to accept the bid but he failed to gain support. </p> <p>Last night Lord Kirkham said his new bid was final but he had not been trying to get the company on the cheap with his initial offer. \"This offer will not be increased in any circumstances,\" he said, adding: \"It remains my view that the original terms of the offer were fair to shareholders.\" </p> <p>His new offer is 455p cash plus an entitlement to a share in up to \u00a357.5m of rebates the company might win from Customs and Excise. Shareholders will vote on September 23. </p> <p>The shares closed up 3.7% at 441p, indicating that final victory for Lord Kirkham is still far from certain. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Retail tycoon Philip Green yesterday dismissed suggestions that he is planning to make an offer for J Sainsbury as shares in the ailing supermarket chain leapt on renewed bid speculation. </p> <p>\"It's absolute rubbish,\" Mr Green said. \"I've been back in the UK for 48 hours and I haven't talked to anyone.\" </p> <p>Sainsbury's shares rose 13p to close at 271p. </p> <p>The retail billionaire, bruised by his failed attempt to take over Marks&amp;Spencer, is seen by many as being in need of a big deal to provide extra space for his best fashion labels - and just to show that he can do so. </p> <p>Mr Green last winter approached Sir Peter Davis, then chief executive of Sainsbury's, with a \u00a36.4bn bid proposal, but was swiftly shown the door. Any takeover would require the approval of the Sainsbury family, which still controls 34% of the business. </p> <p>An alternative potential bidder is cash-rich US retailer Target, which is said to have dispatched senior executives to Britain to search for acquisitions. A Target spokeswoman refused to comment on Sainsbury's but said there was still potential in the US. </p> <p>The rumours came as Sainsbury's new chief executive, Justin King, appointed former Safeway director Lawrence Christensen to sort out supply chain problems.

OK.\" How about building a paper-recycling machine that literally runs on rainforest tree trunks? A pause. \"Whatever new technology comes out, we'll look at,\" says Nicola firmly.

  "Most of those convicted under anti-terrorist laws in the last three years are non-Muslim, despite the fact most of those arrested have been Muslim, says the most detailed study yet of how the legislation has been used. <p>The report, published today by the Institution of Race Relations, examines all arrests made since September 11 2001 for which data is available. </p> <p>It accuses police of discrimination, and is likely to fuel concern about the disparity between the hundreds of arrests made and the handful of terror-related convictions. </p> <p>The findings show that only three of the 15 people convicted under anti-terror laws in the past three years are known to be Muslim - and two of those have been granted leave to appeal. In comparison, at least two-thirds of the 287 arrests examined - out of 609 - were Muslims. The report says this discrepancy provides evidence of \"excessive and discriminatory use of arrest powers\". </p> <p>It adds: \"Since arrests under anti-terrorist laws attract widespread media coverage while convictions of non-Muslims in court have not been widely reported, most people are left with the impression that the criminal justice system is successfully prosecuting Muslim terrorists in Britain. </p> <p>\"The reality is that large numbers of innocent Muslims are being arrested, questioned and released while the majority of those convicted ... are non-Muslim.\" </p> <p>Harmit Athwal, the study's author, added: \"That so many Muslims are arrested but so few convicted reflects the institutionalisation of anti-Muslim racism in police operations and the criminalisation of entire communities. It is a strategy that is both discriminatory and counter-productive.\" </p> <p>Metropolitan police figures have shown a sharp rise in Asians being held under stop-and-search powers. </p> <p>David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat MP for Eastleigh and a member of the joint committee on human rights, said it might not be surprising to see more Muslims than non-Muslims arrested as the main terrorist threat had been seen to come from Islamist groups. </p> <p>He added: \"If that logic continued ... you would expect most of those found guilty to be Muslim. Either there is something unsafe about the way suspects are identified and arrested, or we may be missing those involved in other terrorist activities.\" </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"The issue of disproportionality is something we are looking at.\"</p>",
  "<p>In his MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival last weekend, John Humphrys bemoaned the increase in programmes that \"coarsen, brutalise and turn us into voyeurs\". He lamented the way in which the exploitative values of reality shows have infected much of TV. But it is not only the quality of the programmes that is being infected. Those who make TV programmes of all kinds are being exploited like never before. </p> <p>Recently, a young woman from an ethnic minority background who had just completed a training course was taken on by one of the richest independent production companies to work on a programme about arranged marriages for a public service broadcaster. Desperate to get a start in the industry, but lacking experience, she had to work as an unpaid researcher. </p> <p>TV industry unions support genuine work experience. But more and more employers break their minimum conditions. According to one producer: \"Anyone wanting to enter British TV who hasn't got a private income or can't work for nothing, or at best minimal expenses, will have a tough time.\" </p> <p>We hear much about the sums paid to stars and executives - Big Brother boss Peter Bazalgette pulled in \u00a31.49m last year - but not about the growing number of producers, camera operators and researchers forced to live near the poverty line. </p> <p>Tony Blair says the media \"will deliver the growth, jobs and the international success of the future\". A survey in 2000 found that 115,000 people worked in the UK television, film, video and related industries. By 2002 that figure had grown to 200,000. However, of the 200,000, less than 50,000 were working in broadcast TV - not much more than in the 1960s when we had only three channels. </p> <p>Until the 80s, most jobs in TV were well-paid, pensionable and permanent. On census day in June 2002 almost a third of those working were freelances. Behind them lay tens of thousands more not working - a pool of anxious, frustrated, under- or unemployed people, increasingly open to exploitation. </p> <p>Meanwhile, media, broadcasting and film courses turn out thousands of eager graduates each year. There are now over 800 courses, enough to replace the entire TV workforce every five years. </p> <p>Exploitation and insecurity affect every level of the industry. \"The people making many of today's programmes don't want people with experience,\" says Chris Frederick, line producer of BBC2's 1998 biography of Dennis Potter and Channel 4's award-winning 2002 series from the Kumbh Mela. \"The product is so formulaic, they don't need us.\" </p> <p>Gone are the days when TV unions held employers to ransom with threats of programme blackouts, of technicians as rich as oil sheikhs, the industry which Mrs Thatcher called \"the last bastion of restrictive practices\". One official from the main technicians' union, Bectu, recently received a string of complaints about breaches of health and safety rules and excessive hours from a TV crew, all people with years of experience. But not one would go with him to confront the employer; all feared they might not work again. </p> <p>The award-winning TV producer Martin Smith is convinced that \"excess working hours are now endemic - they are planned or connived at, or at best ignored, by senior management throughout television\". </p> <p>Last year's Communications Act heightened a climate of naked competition in TV production. The government aims to make the UK \"the most dynamic, competitive communications industry in the world\". So the commodification of programme-making is intensified as production companies increasingly view production as simply a means to an end - owning rights and exploiting them. </p> <p>The rapid growth in programmes made by independents has exacerbated levels of exploitation. In only four years the percentage of programmes produced in the UK by independents has increased from 20% to 30%, worth \u00a31.4bn, having risen \u00a3400m in the last year alone. Pact, whose members already benefit from a quota requiring broadcasters to acquire 25% of programmes from independents, is now calling for the BBC to have to buy at least 50% from outsiders. Ofcom has indicated that it may look favourably on an increase. </p> <p>Changes in the terms of trade and the rules governing qualification for independent status have encouraged outside venture capitalists into the industry, with the result that big broadcaster-producers like Granada and the large, commercial-orientated independents which already make 80% of independent programmes, seem likely to become even more dominant. Hundreds of smaller producer-programme makers - once the creative driving-force of the independent sector - will be replaced by just a handful of \"super-indies\". </p> <p>Already, says one regional independent, broadcasters which once insisted that independents making programmes for them stick to union agreements \"don't give two hoots about the terms under which people work for us\". Regional ITV companies, which four years ago paid independents \u00a318,500 for a half-hour documentary, now pay \u00a314,000. Fifteen years ago the BBC or Channel 4 would have paid \u00a320,000 or \u00a330,000. </p> <p>Even those who one would think immune suffer. A director, recognised as one of the best directors of classical music programmes in the world, has earned only \u00a36,000 this year. He often directs the broadcast of one of the year's major musical events. Then he was asked to take on one of the broadcaster's trainees. The following year the director he had trained was detailed to direct the first half of the event while he was offered only the second half, the part that went out live, but for half his fee. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Michael Darlow is the author of Independents Struggle - The Programme Makers who took on the TV Establishment, published by Quartet Books this summer.</p>",
  "From the time he took silk in 1966, it was a rare week when Basil Wigoder, who has died aged 83, could not be found in an important case at the Old Bailey. As a life peer, he was an active Liberal. <p>Born in Manchester, he was the son of a dentist father and a mother who was a magistrate. An open scholarship in modern history took him from Manchester grammar school to Oriel College, Oxford. For the last three years of the second world war he was in the Royal Artillery, and in 1945-46 he returned to Oxford, where he was president of the union, and was called to the bar, joining Gray's Inn. </p> <p>His career at the bar was mostly in criminal work. In 1951 he was led by AP Marshall, KC, in the case of Willcock v Muddle, which signalled the end of the use of wartime identity cards, and he remained a champion of the individual. </p> <p>A regular prosecutor, he appeared in such diverse cases as that of Anthony Reuter, the <i>soi-disant</i> King of the Teddy Boys, who, in 1956, received five years for malicious wounding, and that of a man fined \u00a350 in 1961 for kicking a greyhound in a race at Wembley. He was also much in demand as a defence lawyer, and over the years his clients included Lord Wigg, the former paymaster general, who was acquitted of kerb crawling; Sheila Buckley, the mistress of John Stonehouse, another former Labour minister, who faked his suicide in 1974; the artist Francis Bacon on a charge of possessing cannabis; and Alfred Berman, one of the defendants in the so-called Richardson torture trial of 1966. Unlike most of the other defendants in that case, Berman was acquitted. </p> <p>Another of Wigoder's clients was Jonathan Aitken, accused in 1971 under the Official Secrets Act of passing classified information to the Sunday Telegraph about the Biafran war. Wigoder argued success fully that it was his duty \"in the interests of the state\" to have done so. Variations on the defence have been regularly used since the case. Over the years Wigoder was a constant critic of some of the provisions of the act, which he regarded as illiberal and unfair. </p> <p>His first defence after becoming a QC was a successful appearance before the severe Mr Justice Thesiger on behalf of a man charged with the murder of a fellow guest at a party in Notting Hill. Wigoder argued that the man was defending himself against an unprovoked attack. </p> <p>That same year he appeared in the curious case of a Nigerian student, Mr Orishagbemi, accused of murdering his tenant. The defence was that the girl was a witch who had cast a spell on both Orishagbemi and his wife; Orishagbemi had merely been endeavouring to exorcise the spell. Given the unpromising material on this occasion, it is not surprising Wigoder was unsuccessful. </p> <p>Wigoder also appeared in a number of IRA trials, including acting for a defendant in the Aldershot bombing, and the Guildford four, convicted of a pub bombing in 1975. Their convictions were overturned 14 years later. </p> <p>Although in 1974 Wigoder entered the House of Lords, he was one of many barristers who had tried their hand, initially unsuccessfully, at politics. In 1945 he was defeated in the general election, standing as a Liberal candidate for Bournemouth. He finished ahead of the Labour candidate, but in the October of the same year was third in a byelection for that constituency. </p> <p>In 1957 and 1964 he was unsuccessful as a candidate for Westbury, in Wiltshire. He became chairman of the Liberal party executive in 1963, and was chairman of the conference organising committee in 1965-66. He was made Liberal chief whip in the Lords from 1977 to 1984, and spoke on home and health service affairs from 1983 to 1988. In his speeches in the Lords, he was highly critical of government proposals both to reduce the right of trial by jury and effectively give the prosecution a right of appeal in so-called lenient sentencing cases. He thought the problem had been exaggerated. </p> <p>Described by one barrister as \"a very nice, typical Mancunian, down-to-earth and with no pomposity or flannel\", in and out of court Wigoder was both well-liked and respected by his colleagues at the bar. </p> <p>Wigoder was a recorder of the crown court from 1972 to 1984. During that time he co-chaired with Lewis Hawser QC a Justice committee that recommended the transfer of criminal prosecutions by the police to an independent department of public prosecutions. In 1967, he was a Board of Trade inspector appointed to examine the conduct of Pinnock Finance. </p> <p>He was a member of the general council of the bar for four years from 1970, and served on the crown court rules committee (1971-77). In 1972, along with Jeremy Hutchinson, John Hazan and Michael Hill, he founded the Criminal Bar Association. In 1977 he was appointed chairman of the Health Services Board and, after it was abolished by Margaret Thatcher in 1980, he was chairman of BUPA (1981-92), and then its vice president. He was also vice president of the Statute Society (1984-90). </p> <p>Describing himself as a life-long leg spinner, he retired from village green cricket at the age of 64, when he felt his fielding was letting the side down. He remarked on one occasion: \"I am told you can play cricket better after a marijuana cigarette than after a couple of pints of beer,\" but there is no suggestion he ever tried to put the theory into practice. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, the former Yoland Levinson, whom he married in 1948, and by their twin son and daughter, and two further sons. </p> <p> <b> Celia Thomas writes:</b> Lord Wigoder was appointed Liberal chief whip by Lord Byers, the party's leader in the Lords. They forged a close and much-respected partnership in the dedicated, but relatively small, band of Liberal peers. As well as keeping his flock informed about when they were required to vote, Wigoder also liked on occasions to send round a note telling them what they were voting about, and why. One bill which he expected to fight hard was the Tories' Protection Of Official Information Bill in November 1979 - their first attempt to reform the Official Secrets Act - but this was dropped after being excoriated by peers from all round the house, of which Wigoder was one. </p> <p>Being chief whip certainly did not silence him, as is the custom in the other parties. He took full part in all criminal justice legislation, and in debates about the freedom of the press.

  "<p>Sir Alastair Morton, who has died of a heart attack at the age of 66, was the man who got the Channel Tunnel built. Without his drive and energy in rescuing a project in deep trouble when he was appointed as co-chairman in early 1987, it is doubtful that the link between Britain and France would ever have been completed. </p> <p>When Morton arrived, Eurotunnel, the company created to build and operate the tunnel, was in disarray. Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, had insisted that the project should be completely private, with no public money, but it had got into serious difficulties even before a single sod had been turned. The banks, which were funding it, had been given a far too generous deal, and so had the contractors who were to build it. This, as one insider put it, \"meant they could charge extra for virtually anything they did. It was like a housebuilder saying: 'We can do you a bathroom, but it will cost you.'\" </p> <p>Morton, a famously abrasive and fearsome character, tall, and with a razor-sharp mind, spent the next five years trying to rein back on the awful contracts. He became adept, as one former transport minister put it, \"at holding a gun to the head of the bankers, his finger silkily hovering over the trigger and saying: 'All right, make the project go bust and you will lose all your money.'\" </p> <p>Morton was fearless and always ready to push the other side to the brink, knowing that the collapse of the project would benefit no one. Having inherited a project whose future was by no means certain, by the time he left there were trains running through the tunnel, now a vital part of Britain's infrastructure. </p> <p>He was born and brought up in Johannesburg: his father was a Scottish oil engineer and his mother was an Afrikaner. Morton was educated at St John's College, Johannesburg, and Witwatersrand University, but came to Britain to study law at Worcester College, Oxford, as a De Beers scholar and remained in England for the rest of his life, although he did spend some time back in Africa and also with the World Bank in Washington. </p> <p>His first big job with a political angle was as managing director of the British National Oil Corporation (1976-80) whose privatisation in 1983 by Thatcher he later fiercely opposed. By 1982, he had earned a reputation as a good operator and troubleshooter, becoming chief executive, and in 1987 chairman, of Guinness Peat, the troubled finance house which was on the verge of bankruptcy when he was appointed. </p> <p>Despite the superficial bad temper, born really of a simple intolerance of fools, he was very good to work with, attracting great loyalty from his colleagues. Moreover, he was passionate about the intellectual cut and thrust of the debates over privatisation and transport policy. I still treasure the letter he sent to me after I had written an article in The Independent about the soaring costs of the Eurotunnel project, dismissing my argument by writing in the first sentence: \"Strewth, this is like shooting fish in a barrel.\" There are not many major company chairmen prepared to take on issues like that; we settled matters in his Canary Wharf office over sandwiches and the best Chablis I have ever drunk. </p> <p>Despite such luxuries, though, his tastes were not extravagant by the standards of today's business leaders: he took a modest salary at Eurotunnel and was unimpressed by the baubles on offer to people in his position. He was not afraid of showing off his intellect, a most unEnglish characteristic. At his inaugural press conference at Eurotunnel, he was quizzed by a French journalist who asked why a South African should be appointed as the British co-chairman of an Anglo-French project. In fluent French, he casually explained his father's Scottish background and that he had a UK passport. And then, when a South African journalist asked a question, he berated the poor fellow in Afrikaans, but, unfortunately, nobody else quite knew what he said.</p> <p>Before leaving Eurotunnel in 1996, and still fascinated by the public/private interface, he was chairman of the private finance panel (1993-95), which advised the chancellor of the exchequer and led to the highly controversial Private Finance Initiative. </p> <p>Morton was a thoroughly honest man who, despite dealing with highly political projects that involved government for much of his life in business, never quite understood the extent of the duplicity of politicians and civil servants. So when he was approached to take on the chairmanship of the soon-to-be-created Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) in 1999, he thought that the job would be what it said on the tin - that the organisation would be both strategic and have authority. </p> <p>Morton quickly realised that the previous notion of the privatised railway, short-term contracts to franchisees who therefore had little longterm interest in the industry, would never deliver the long-term investment that the railways needed. He devised the concept of 20-year franchises together with Special Purpose Vehicles, joint public-private ventures that would invest in improvements. There were to be new lines, increased capacity and even, possibly, new tunnels under London. He had been encouraged to set out such visionary schemes by John Prescott, the then transport secretary with whom, despite their different backgrounds, Morton got on; but Prescott's replacement in 2001 by Stephen Byers spelt the end for the \"integrated transport\" vision. With the Treasury panicking about the cost, Morton's days at the SRA were numbered. There was to be no blue skies thinking, and he was replaced after two-and-a-half years in the job by Richard Bowker, who was given a much narrower remit. </p> <p>None of Morton's schemes have come to fruition and his vision, rather unfairly, is now widely reckoned to have been naive. His failure at the SRA was a source of great disappointment to him. He had suffered serious illness - an overactive thyroid which nearly killed him, and then a bad heart - while at the SRA, but it was his inability to win over the government to his vision of a decent transport system for 21st century Britain that so irked him. It was an issue that he felt passionate about, and he was convinced that the right mix of private and public involvement could bring it about. In that, with the recent announcement of the proposed abolition of the SRA, he appears to have been sadly wrong. He is survived by his wife Sara, whom he married in 1964, their daughter Jessica, and son Hadrian.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Vaughan writes:</strong> Sir Alastair had recently retired as chairman of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain after 10 years in post. He was to have remained an active member of its executive committee. The NYO, of which I am director, embodied two of his great passions: music and the education of young people. He was that rare breed of person who understands the balance between artistic creativity and financial necessity, and always seemed able to marry the two without compromise. </p> <p>A tall, willowy man, his mild manners and soft speech belied his strong style of leadership. One was struck first by his fierce intelligence, which was arresting. He possessed a forensic attention to detail. His penetrating cross-examination often made subordinates quake if they were the subject of his scrutiny. His seriousness as a businessman was matched by a quick sense of humour and a warm and generous spirit. </p> <p>He considered the NYO to be a national treasure and an essential part of British cultural life. His legacy is to have left it a much greater organisation than he found it. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Robert Alastair Newton Morton, businessman, born January 11 1938; died September 1 2004</p>",
  "<p>Being Nellie McKay must be exhausting. So many ideas, so many sounds, to cram into song; so much to say about men and politics and getting older (she's 19); so many years of popular music to celebrate, emulate, toy with and subvert. Her debut album is dizzying in its scope and ambition, fizzing with energy as McKay hurtles from one instrument to another, one genre to the next. She does jazzy torch songs, brassy showtunes, rap, even hippy children's songs, her restless orchestration bringing an idiosyncratic twist to each: a ribbon of flute, a wash of funk guitar, a gurgle as she sings \"pour a drink\". Occasionally her irreverent mood sends the music sliding into pastiche; for all their acerbity, Clonie and Ding Dong could have come from an album by comedy folk parodists Flight of the Conchords. Lyrically, though, her elegance and control are irrefutable, and when, in I Wanna Get Married and Won't U Please Be Nice, she marries sentimental melodies with sardonic visions of love, it's hard not to be dazzled by her poise.</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of Ireland has been fined \u00a3375,000 for several breaches of elementary banking regulations that are believed to have allowed a businessman in Scotland to conduct a suspected multimillion pound tax scam. </p> <p>The Financial Services Authority, which imposed the fine, said an unnamed businessman deposited about \u00a32m in cash at a UK branch, believed to be in Glasgow, asking staff to draw up 40 bank drafts made payable to the Bank of Ireland. </p> <p>He requested that staff not link his name with cheques or correspondence relating to the drafts. Between 1998 and 2002 the drafts were \"effectively used as a nameless deposit account\". This request \"failed to arouse suspicion\" among bank staff, the FSA said. The businessman, one of the largest customers at the Glasgow branch, is believed to be subject to an ongoing Inland Revenue investigation into his tax payments. </p> <p>Bank of Ireland refused to comment on reports that staff at the Glasgow branch had been disciplined. It stressed that the breach was isolated to one branch and had been referred by bank auditors to the FSA. The bank has about 200 branches in Britain including the Bristol &amp; West chain. </p> <p>Philip Robinson, financial crime sector leader at the FSA, said: \"These transactions were high-risk in terms of providing scope for money laundering and were in breach of Bank of Ireland's policies and procedures. Furthermore, they continued for four years. </p> <p>\"The bank did not establish adequate systems and controls to monitor the issuing of bank drafts and did not check that its staff understood fully their anti-money laundering responsibilities in relation to the recognition and reporting of suspicious transactions.\" </p> <p>The fine comes less than four months after BoI's main rival, Allied Irish, admitted that several executives had held funds in an offshore firm involved in tax evasion. Irish regulators are still investigating links between five executives and Faldor, a British Virgin Islands-registered company. Together with former bank staff, they are said to have evaded some \u00a3500,000 in tax.</p>",
  "<p>How do you make a film about the Edinburgh festival? And why? It's week three of the Fringe, and in a tent in George Square Gardens, the director Annie Griffin is shooting her new feature film, Festival. In front of the cameras, an actress playing a journalist interviews an actor playing a comedian. Behind the cameras, a journalist (that's me) interviews an actress playing the comedian's PA. A camera crew is filming another camera crew. Is this anything more than industry navel-gazing? Can Festival have anything to say to the world beyond the Assembly Rooms bar? </p> <p>Resoundingly yes, according to Griffin, best known as the writer-director of Channel 4's acclaimed sitcom The Book Group. In her pre-film-making life, Griffin (a native of Buffalo, New York) was a highly regarded theatre-maker, with a distinguished Edinburgh pedigree. \"I did student theatre productions on the Royal Mile,\" she says. \"I did one-woman shows at the Traverse.\" And once you're bitten by the Edinburgh bug, there's no permanent cure. \"I have very vivid memories of my times here,\" says Griffin, \"of everything happening at once; of the intensity of everything. And of course Edinburgh is the most incredible-looking city, and you never see it on film. </p> <p>\"The amazing thing about the festival,\" she adds, \"is that everybody thinks that their show is going to absolutely get people, is going to be the thing that changes everything.\" Her first feature brings 15 of those wannabes together in a tale that Griffin describes as \"Nashville at the Edinburgh festival\". Like the Robert Altman classic, the script for Festival interweaves multiple stories. There's the young optimist (played by upcoming theatre star Lynsey Marshall) with a one-woman show about Dorothy Wordsworth. There's an experimental theatre troupe from Nova Scotia. There's a neurotic actor with a solo show, called I Confess, about paedophile priests. And there are a handful of comedians whose names - Sean Sullivan, Conor Kelly, Tommy O'Dwyer - suggest that Griffin thinks of stand-up as an exclusively Irish pursuit. </p> <p>Edinburgh veterans will recognise these characters instantly. According to the producer Christopher Young, it was easy enough to distil the sprawling variety of the Fringe to 15 individual stories. \"Although you've got hundreds of shows,\" he says, \"the same themes keep coming through, in terms of what the performers are trying to do, their obsession with getting coverage, the fact that nobody's coming to their show or everybody's going to someone else's show.\" For that reason, he's sure that the film has appeal beyond the hermetic world of fringe theatre. \"In the end, these are human beings, who have the same hang-ups - sex, money, success, failure - as the rest of us. It's just that, at the festival, these issues become incredibly intense. The highs are higher and the lows are lower.\" </p> <p>A bigger challenge, he says, (especially on a \u00a31.8m budget) is capturing the heady atmosphere of the Fringe - the teeming, sensual, multicoloured experience - on film. For that, Griffin has used some of the techniques of documentary making. According to Young, \"we've got two cameras out on the street all this week gathering Edinburgh festival sights and sounds\". Onlookers are co-opted as extras. With cameraman Danny Cohen, Griffin is filming Edinburgh on the hoof, improvising in order to capture different facets of the festival experience. </p> <p>\"There is a thing in film about wanting to control the world,\" says Griffin, disapprovingly. \"But you can't control the Edinburgh festival. We're looking at what's there and responding to it. Yesterday, we had a scene to shoot on Victoria Terrace. And rather than saying, 'let's clear everybody out of here,' and so on, we just got on with what we were doing. Nobody ever said to anybody 'go away'. People would walk through shots and it was fine.\" That's why Griffin and Young chose not to cast starry names. \"You'd lose your guerrilla film-making feel,\" says Young. \"We're able to say, 'hey, why don't we call the actor now and shoot a scene in this bar, even though it's not in the script?' You have to have an actor who's up for that.\" </p> <p>Step forward, Daniela Nardini, erstwhile star of This Life, and Raquel Cassidy, of Teachers. \"In movie terms,\" says Young, \"these are unknowns.\" They're also Edinburgh novices. Stephen Mangan, who plays the dastardly stand-up superstar Sean Sullivan, last played Edinburgh 14 years ago, in a student show that shared a venue with celebrity madam Cynthia Payne. Cassidy has never performed here - although she has visited Edinburgh enough to know that the festival is \"such an extreme experience, from the amount you imbibe to the amount you stay out, from falling in and out of love, and in and out of love with yourself, all the time\". </p> <p>In Festival, Cassidy plays Sean Sullivan's put-upon PA. In front of the cameras, Sullivan is being interviewed in a mocked-up recording studio, surrounded by fake posters for imaginary Edinburgh shows. The smarmy stand-up is stonewalling all questions posed by his Radio Scotland interrogator, played by Nardini. \"So what brings you to Edinburgh?\" asks Nardini. \"The train,\" replies Mangan. \"Next question.\" </p> <p>On which famed stand-up could such a scoundrel possibly be based? \"We've had people from the comedy industry,\" says Griffin, \"saying, 'you can't write something like that based on Sean Hughes.' Or 'you can't do Tommy Tiernan like that; he's going to sue you.' Everyone thinks they know who he is.\" Mangan, who slightly resembles Steve Coogan, is keeping tight-lipped. All he'll say is that \"Sean is a brilliant role, because apparently I'm the funniest man in Britain, and everyone laughs at everything I say, but I never have to do any stand-up comedy.\" The very idea of having to impersonate a stand-up fills Mangan with dread: \"It's like with golf and football movies,\" he says, conjuring images of Sylvester Stallone in Escape to Victory. \"You don't have to be an expert to tell that the actors can't do it very well.\" </p> <p>Try telling that to Chris O'Dowd, the Irish actor who has to convince as the hot Edinburgh stand-up Tommy O'Dwyer. O'Dowd has seen 22 stand-ups in Edinburgh so far, and sought tips from Have I Got News for You star Dara O'Briain. He is less daunted by the technical challenge of acquiring stand-up skills than by \"getting into the mentality of a comedian. They're the writer and director and performer of their own work; whereas actors are just pieces in the jigsaw. And so they perceive criticism of their work as criticism of them as a person.\" Griffin agrees: \"There's a lot of envy and competition in stand-up. It's not a supportive culture.\" </p> <p>Unfazed, O'Dowd has decided that, having learnt the skills for the movie, he's going to take up stand-up himself. \"I've made a bet that in the next few months I'll do some gigs. So the best way for this story to end would be for me to be nominated for the Perrier award at next year's Edinburgh festival.\" That may also be when Festival is given its premiere - although Christopher Young has his eye on Cannes. A film about festivals is sure to entertain a festival crowd. But back in the real world? \"If the film is as funny as the script,\" says Young, with a play on words that suggests the exposure to stand-up is rubbing off, \"then we're laughing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Many coaches would have ducked the challenge. To follow in the slipstream of the man who brought the World Cup to England is the ultimate no-win situation and Andy Robinson made it clear yesterday that, to the end, he asked Sir Clive Woodward to remain as England's chief coach. </p> <p>\"I made it very clear to the RFU and Clive that my wish was for him to stay on as head coach,\" said the 40-year-old Robinson.\"I wish him all the best. However, I have now been offered an opportunity, which I have accepted, and I'm looking forward to England's first training session on September 20.\" </p> <p>Those who know Robinson and watched his playing and coaching career at Bath say he will not be fazed by the chance of staking a claim to the job full time. </p> <p>\"Don't expect the England team that runs out in the autumn against Canada, South Africa and Australia to look like a team Clive Woodward would have picked,\" said a friend last night. \"Robbo has his own views about some of the players, and they are not necessarily the same as Woodward. </p> <p>\"They think very differently. Woodward is more lateral thinking - then again he's more lateral thinking than almost anyone else. Robbo has his own views, but there hasn't been a whisper of disagreement that's escaped the England camp. Robbo wouldn't think about undermining Woodward; it's not the way he works.\" </p> <p>The way Andy Robinson works has not changed much since he grew up in Paulton, Somerset, the son of a sergeant who taught at the former police college at Canonsgrove and who Robinson idolised. </p> <p>Ray Robinson played cricket and rugby for Somerset but in later years was confined to a wheelchair by multiple sclerosis. He lived with from the illness for 26 years and when it finally blinded him, a friend stood by his side at his son's matches and gave a running commentary. </p> <p>\"Whatever I've done, he was behind it and I still look at it that way,\" said Robinson after his father's death. \"The one thing he instilled in me is that, no matter what happens, you must always enjoy your life and you must always take up the next challenge. So, despite defeat, despite disappointment, you keep your feet on the ground and you look forward. That's something deep inside me.\" </p> <p>The three Robinson boys used their father's college as their own training ground. \"It's where they perfected their spin passes and got super-fit,\" said John Morrison, the former England A second row, last night. \"They also used the first-team bath as their swimming pool.\" </p> <p>After school at Taunton and caps for England Under-19 and England schoolboys, Robinson went to Loughborough and despite breaking a kneecap, led the rugby team to the UAU championship in 1986. He then followed Morrison, now his brother-in-law, to Bath and the first real rugby collision in his life. </p> <p>Roger Spurrell, a former paratrooper and one of the sparks behind Bath's revival under Jack Rowell, played open side - the position Robinson coveted. \"It happened on a wet Monday night at the club's training ground at Lambridge,\" a friend said last night. \"It wasn't just a battle of wills. Spurrell was one of the hard men of English rugby and took exception to a 21-year-old taking his position.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, Robinson made his debut for Bath and in four years did not miss a match. He was capped for England in his second full season under the then new captain, Will Carling. </p> <p>In 1989 he went with the Lions to Australia, knowing it would be a disappointing trip because Findlay Calder, the captain, also played open side. </p> <p>\"The thing you have to understand,\" said Morrison, \"is that everyone said Andy was too small to be a rugby player, let alone a forward, but he won seven caps for England and was voted player of the year.\" </p> <p>When Rowell left Bath for England Robinson was nominated by the players to take over as coach. \"One Saturday he was playing, the next he was looking after a team which contained the likes of Phil de Glanville [later to become England captain] and Mike Catt. </p> <p>\"It was then that he met up with Woodward. I think Clive had just left London Irish and was between jobs. Andy asked him to look after the backs, so I guess Clive is returning the favour.\" </p> <p><strong> 1964</strong> Born Taunton </p> <p><strong> 1986</strong> Joins Bath after degree at Loughborough University </p> <p><strong> 1988</strong> First England cap v Australia in Sydney </p> <p><strong> 1987</strong> Picked for Lions tour to Australia </p> <p><strong> 1989</strong> European player of year </p> <p><strong> 1992</strong> Captains Bath to cup and league double </p> <p><strong> 1997</strong> Succeeds Brian Ashton as Bath coach </p> <p><strong> 1988</strong> Bath become European champions </p> <p><strong> 2000</strong> Appointed England coach under manager Clive Woodward </p> <p><strong> 2004 </strong> Named England coach for autumn Tests</p>",
  "<p>When the decision was taken to kick off the Zurich Premiership season with a Twickenham double-header, no one dreamed it would involve the departure of the two most charismatic heads in English rugby. Sir Clive Woodward and Lawrence Dallaglio may both have good reasons for exiting stage left but, not for the first time, the country's top clubs are now being asked to make a drama out of a crisis. </p> <p>As the winds of change come howling down the Rugby Football Union's corridors, however, this is also a season of rich possibilities and potential flux at club level. It might be assumed, with the rugby world rocking, that the familiar likes of Wasps, Leicester and Bath will maintain the status quo. Judging by the squad lists, that sort of complacency is a dangerous game. </p> <p>Talk to those at the Premiership sharp end and they will testify that standards are levelling out with each passing year, not least as a consequence of the salary cap. An awful lot of people are tipping Leicester for the title, which is fair enough. The defending champions Wasps should also finish in the top three, particularly with Dallaglio at their disposal for the entire season. The majority, though, are simply shrugging their shoulders, aware the margins are tight enough to make monkeys of even the sagest pundits. </p> <p>Saracens, for example, have one of the strongest squads in the league on paper. Northampton have so many well-known South Africans they might as well rename themselves East Midlands Tribe. Gloucester have the doughty Olivier Azam back in their front row and the gifted James Forrester fit again at No8. London Irish swear they will be dissatisfied with anything less than a top-six finish. And on it goes, from Newcastle, for whom Jonny Wilkinson makes his long-awaited return on Sunday, to the increasingly sold-out Harlequins. </p> <p>The same sense of equality persists at what most would assume to be opposite ends of the Premiership spectrum. Wasps may have completed a domestic and European double barely three months ago but their director of rugby Warren Gatland is not noticeably gung-ho as his side chase a third consecutive Zurich title. </p> <p>Injuries have robbed him of his first-choice England centres Fraser Waters and Stuart Abbott plus his inspirational scrum-half Rob Howley. Craig Dowd is also crocked and Simon Shaw has a neck strain. Joe Worsley and Josh Lewsey, meanwhile, are on the bench against Saracens tomorrow under the terms of the elite-player squad agreement. \"We are a little bit exposed and the other guys have got to step up to the mark,\" concedes Gatland, also aware many of Wasps' rivals have had a longer, more settled pre-season. </p> <p>And high on the list of clubs shadow-boxing impressively are the ante-post favourites to finish bottom. Can newly promoted Worcester buck the immutable law of Premiership rugby which states that what comes up must inevitably go back down? The doomsayers should listen to the Warriors' coach John Brain as he nails their lazy presumptions. </p> <p>\"Finishing 11th wouldn't satisfy our expectations of this squad,\" growls Brain. \"Some of our supporters might well settle for that but the coaches and players believe we can achieve more. We won 26 league games last year by playing 15-man rugby so we have the ability to attack through the backs and the forwards. If we can do that at the next level we will be very happy. But it all starts up front and any Premiership coach will tell you your home games are vitally important.\" </p> <p>What also makes Worcester different to last season's punchbags Rotherham is their fierce intolerance of mediocrity, with the former Wallaby lock Tom Bowman already told to pack his bags because of poor fitness levels. \"We're a no-frills rugby regime here. If you don't like hard work you won't last all that long,\" continues Brain. </p> <p>\"Win or lose, we have to make sure we learn something from every game. If we beat Newcastle this weekend it's no guarantee of anything, nor will it be if we lose.\"</p>",
  "<p>No sooner had Stewart Cink been selected for the United States Ryder Cup team than he went and won a tournament. All season long he had played anxious golf and succeeded only in worrying his way out of the top 10 to become dependent on being picked. When he was, a huge wave of relief carried him to victory in the NEC Invitational next week. Such is the pressure exerted by the Ryder Cup. </p> <p>Now the Cink scenario could be matched here by Luke Donald who, selected for the European team on Sunday, played his way yesterday into contention for the European Masters. </p> <p>Miguel Angel Jimenez, who qualified for the team early in the season and has relaxed his way into four wins this year, leads with a six-under-par 65, with Marc Farry, Peter Hedblom and Sergio Garcia a stroke behind. Then comes Donald with his 67 which, like most rounds, could have been a couple of shots better. </p> <p>Donald said afterwards: \"The last few weeks I have played with a lot of pressure on my shoulders, so today I tried to have some fun. I was cruising along at five under after 11 when maybe I had a little bit of a lapse in concentration. Maybe I got too relaxed.\" </p> <p>Having dropped a shot at the 4th, his 13th, Donald made the mistake of not getting past the dog-leg with his tee shot to the 5th, could not see the green as a result, left his second short, chipped badly and then three-putted. That sequence may be more than \"a little bit of a lapse\", containing four quite considerable errors, but at least it jolted Donald out of cruise control. He birdied the next two holes and was pleased overall with his round. </p> <p>Jimenez won in Munich last week with a superb display that got overshadowed by the obsession with the Ryder Cup picks and he plans to play in next week's German Masters, the week before the cup match in Detroit. But he will come under pressure not to from another Spaniard, Garcia. If Jimenez does play, the Ryder Cup will be the Spaniard's sixth tournament in six weeks and Garcia does not think that a good idea. </p> <p>\"I will talk to him about that,\" said Garcia. \"He has been playing unbelievably and, if you are contending in an event, it takes a lot out you. For myself this is my fourth week in a row and I am really looking forward to a rest next week. So I will talk to him. We don't want him to be tired on Saturday afternoon or Sunday.\" </p> <p>Garcia is a team member delighted by the inclusion of Colin Montgomerie and the Scot himself could hardly be happier. Langer said, when he told him he was being picked, that all the players who had previously qualified had said, when asked, that they wanted Monty in the team. \"In a way,\" said Montgomerie, \"that means more to me than being picked. </p> <p>\"To have the approval of everyone on the team is very satisfying as I don't think there was any sentiment in those answers. Why would there be? They wanted me on the team because of what I can do, not what I have done in the past. I feel ready to go and do well. If I didn't, I would have said no.\"</p>"
