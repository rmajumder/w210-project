  "<p>Last season Porto were underdogs in the Champions League but went on to win it. This season, despite their status as European champions, they seem intent on repeating the feat by making themselves even bigger outsiders. They go into tonight's match at Chelsea in the worst imaginable shape. </p> <p>With their coach and several of their best players departed, Porto's season has started badly. But they will still be keen to show Jose Mourinho they can succeed without him. </p> <p>Mourinho's close-season departure for Chelsea prompted Porto to import the Italian Luigi Del Neri from Chievo Verona only to sack him after six weeks, before a ball had been kicked in anger. Del Neri, who upset the squad after changing tactics and training methods, said: \"The Portuguese have no understanding of tactical culture.\" </p> <p>Porto looked nearer home, to neighbouring Spain, to replace Del Neri by drafting in the former Celta Vigo coach V\u00edctor Fern\u00e1ndez. </p> <p>He had little time to prepare his team. They lost to Claudio Ranieri's Valencia in Monaco in the European Supercup, drew in the league with Braga, Estoril and Uniao de Leiria, and were held goalless at home in between by CSKA Moscow in the Champions League. Last Saturday's 1-0 win away to Vitoria Guimaraes stopped the rot, but the last time Porto had gone four matches or more without winning was four seasons ago, before the Mourinho era. </p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez has tried various systems, from 4-3-3 to 4-4-2 to 4-2-4, but all without success and he has yet to find the right formula. \"We have to be more humble and work harder,\" said the midfield anchorman Costinha. \"We have to keep the same attitude we had in the past, as we're a winning club. Sometimes you need to review the structure; we all have to reflect on it. We need to work closer together and we also need to take our chances more.\" </p> <p>He was not worried about Chelsea's good start, saying: \"I've seen lots of teams win their first game and then not qualify - no disrespect to Chelsea.\" </p> <p>Porto sold their defenders Ricardo Carvalho and Paulo Ferreira to Chelsea, the playmaker Deco to Barcelona and the midfielder Pedro Mendes to Tottenham for a combined \u00a342m. They signed the winger Ricardo Quaresma from Barcelona, Helder Postiga from Tottenham, the defender Pepe from Mar\u00edtimo, the Greek right-back Giourkas Seitaridis from Panathinaikos, Hugo Leal from Paris Saint-Germain plus the Brazilians Diego from Santos and Luis Fabiano from Sao Paulo for a total of \u00a316m. </p> <p>That helped pay off some of their debts but left the team uncoordinated. Of the new arrivals, only Luis Fabiano has looked convincing. Injuries to Seitaridis and Nuno Valente mean Porto will be without both their first-choice full-backs against Chelsea. </p> <p>But it is the absence of Mourinho's influence which weighs the heaviest. Rather than the team going through a period of soul-searching, Mourinho would have taken control; players would know where they stood and would already be pulling in the same direction. It does not help that Fern\u00e1ndez has clashed often with the South African striker Benni McCarthy. </p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez has the backing of the Porto board, at least for now. The president, Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa, said: \"Del Neri tried to change too many things. But I've picked the best man now in Fern\u00e1ndez. He'll turn things round.\" </p> <p>A fellow director, Lourenco Pinto, said: \"Mourinho arrived in the middle of a season and had time to build a team for the seasons which followed. People understood this. They have to understand that this is also a transition period.\" </p> <p>The new winger Quaresma said: \"We're a bit frustrated but we have a lot of experienced players who are used to winning and there's a great spirit. I'm sure we'll get back to winning ways very soon.\" But will tonight be too soon?</p>",
  "Allan Levy, QC, who has died of cancer, aged 62, was a passionate advocate for children's rights and the leading expert on child law at the English bar. Though he relished his part in pushing back the boundaries of the law in the sensitive areas in which he specialised, for him the law was primarily an instrument to be used for the protection of the most vulnerable and powerless participants in the legal process - children. <p>In an article in the Observer last July, he called for a total ban on smacking or hitting children, and wrote: \"Adults cannot pick and choose among the human rights they bestow on children. The right to respect for one's human dignity and physical integrity is fundamental for all of us.\" </p> <p>Allan felt real anger at the mistreatment of children, whether it was abuse at the hands of parents or carers, or neglect or maladministration by the agencies whose duty it was to protect children, but who, too often, let them down. </p> <p>That anger came across in the inquiry he chaired into the so-called \"pindown\" procedure, the solitary confinement regime for rebellious youngsters practised for six years in Staffordshire children's homes in the 1980s. His 1991 report branded the practice \"unethical, unprofessional and unacceptable\", and he castigated it as \"a fundamental abuse of human rights\". </p> <p>Born in Bury, Greater Manchester, the only child of a shopkeeper, Allan was educated at Bury grammar school and Hull University, where he was a far from diligent student and took an undistinguished law degree. He was admitted to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1969. </p> <p>He had a slow start professionally, initially practising from little-known chambers, and first came to public notice in 1987, when a high court judge gave doctors the go-ahead to perform a sterilisation operation on a 17-year-old girl with Down's syndrome and a mental age of six. Allan acted for the official solicitor, representing the girl's interests. The case went to the House of Lords, who allowed the operation to go ahead, though not before the affair had generated huge public controversy. </p> <p>From about that point, the official solicitor's office was involved in a series of groundbreaking cases testing the boundaries of medical law and ethics, and it was to Allan that its lawyers turned in these difficult cases. He was seen not just as a jobbing lawyer but as someone who thought deeply about the ethical issues involved. </p> <p>In an emergency case, where an Oxford student tried, ultimately unsuccessfully, to stop his girlfriend having an abortion, one of the official solicitor's lawyers briefed Allan in a lift. He appeared in important cases on surrogacy and child abduction, and he was at the court of appeal for an emergency Saturday sitting in 1988, when a local authority made the first attempt, rejected by the court, to make a foetus a ward of court. </p> <p>He went on to play a leading role in other high-profile cases, appearing, in 1992, in the first case to raise the issue of an adult's right to refuse life-saving treatment. Allan acted for the father of a 20-year-old accident victim who was heavily sedated and on a ventilator. She was a Jehovah's Witness and had refused blood transfusions. Allan won the order, which was upheld by the court of appeal, for her to be given the transfusions. </p> <p>Also in 1992, he acted for a mother trying to stop doctors taking her brain-damaged baby off a ventilator. The mother failed in that action. </p> <p>The following year, Allan unsuccessfully represented a 34-year-old man making the first application by an adult to have his own adoption order revoked. A non-practising Jew, Allan was fascinated by the case of Jonathan Bradley, who had been adopted by Orthodox Jews and brought up as Ian Rosenthal, only to discover that his real father was an Arab and a former member of the Kuwaiti government. </p> <p>Allan played a key role in winning the right to compensation for children who suffer psychological damage when local authorities either fail to take them into care soon enough or negligently remove them from their parents on a wrong finding of abuse. </p> <p>In the leading case, he represented five children who suffered horrific abuse at their parents' hands, while the local council stood by. The case went to the House of Lords, which ruled, in 1995, that public policy barred legal action against local councils for breaches of their childcare duties; the children eventually succeeded at the European court of human rights. </p> <p>In 1999, with the implementation of the Human Rights Act looming, Allan persuaded the law lords, in the case of Keith Barrett, who had been left to languish in care for his whole childhood, to open the way for compensation claims. He pointed out that a decision in his client's favour would send a clear message to social workers that they were not immune from such claims, thereby helping to ensure proper standards of care. </p> <p>At the time he became ill with cancer of the oesophagus, Allan was poised to take a test case to the House of Lords on behalf of parents trying to sue paediatricians and a local council for mistakenly diagnosing abuse and taking their children into care. He was hoping to overturn rulings by the lower courts that the children, but not the parents, could sue for compensation for psychological trauma. </p> <p>Whenever an issue touching on children and their rights hit the headlines, Allan, one of the most media-friendly of QCs, inevitably popped up on radio and television, where he could be relied on for a perfectly crafted soundbite. He became a QC in 1989, and served as a recorder from 1993 to 2001. </p> <p>Though his earnings at the bar were substantial, at least until the government cut back on legal aid fees for family barristers, he lived a fairly spartan life in his small flat in an anonymous north London block, surrounded by books. His only extravagances were expensive travel and a collection of LS Lowrys. </p> <p>He enjoyed women's company but never married, joking that his abstinence from matrimony had helped to keep the divorce statistics down. A champion for children, he had none of his own. </p> <p><b> Terry Philpot writes:</b> Allan Levy was not only one of the earliest advocates of children's rights, but his legal practice reflected his commitment. He was particularly damning of local authorities that failed to live up to their duties with regard to children in their care. </p> <p>In this regard, his finest hour was perhaps his co-chairmanship of the 1991 pindown inquiry with Barbara Kahan (obituary, August 9 2000). He had not met her previously, and chose her from a list of suggestions for the other member of the inquiry, not realising that she was then 70 years of age. The collaboration flourished, and their friendship continued until her death, after which he chaired the Vladimir and Barbara Kahan Trust. </p> <p>The inquiry was the first into residential care, and led, indirectly, to the Quality Protects initiative, launched by the Department of Health in 1998, to improve a range of childcare services. It also propelled Allan into a position of prominence in the wider childcare field. As the then editor of Community Care magazine, I was aware that social workers often have an irrational suspicion - and even dislike - of lawyers, but Allan's commitment, his powers of advocacy and forensic skills gave him a respect and status not offered to many of his profession. </p> <p>Almost alone among those in the childcare world, he cast doubt last year on the government's drive to promote adoption, fearing it could lead to inappropriate placements. He was a good friend of Young Minds, which supports mentally ill children and adolescents, and an early supporter of the idea of a children's commissioner - soon to be created in England, and already there in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - when it lacked political support. </p> <p>In 1998, he successfully acted for boy A when the European court declared that UK law allowing \"reasonable chastisement\" failed to offer protection to children, and was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Thus, his recent support for the abolition of corporal punishment under the Children Bill was thoroughly fitting. </p> <p> <b> John Critchley writes: </b> Given the nature of his practice, over the years Allan Levy was involved in many high-profile and distressing cases, which inevitably placed considerable demands and strains upon him. Notwithstanding this, a notable characteristic of his style ashead of chambers at 17 Bedford Row was an unpretentious insistence on being always available to members of chambers, formally or informally, for guidance and support. </p> <p>He never forgot his northern origins, and members' professional problems were often analysed and solved by astute reference to some arcane aspect of the history of his beloved Manchester City FC, of which he had an encyclopaedic knowledge, or Lancashire Cricket Club, whose every run he followed, or the paintings of Lowry. </p> <p>Allan was widely read in the most unlikely fields - from philosophy to detective fiction, and all points in between - and was a man of broad culture. But despite a taste for the finer things in life, in practice he found his time devoted to his most pressing concern: support for the vulnerable and the underdog. </p> <p>\u00b7 Allan Edward Levy, barrister and children's rights campaigner, born August 17 1942; died September 26 2004</p>",
  "Russian school children are to wear military-style dog tags and carry \"passports\" displaying their identity and basic medical information to improve school security after the Beslan tragedy. <p>Children in south-eastern Moscow will try out the new documents, starting at the end of the year, with the scheme then moving to cover all of the capital's 1 million pupils. If successful, it will go nationwide. </p> <p>The dog tags will be tucked inside the passport, a small document containing the child's name, fingerprints, a photograph, and next of kin. It will also hold basic medical data such as blood group, allergies or illnesses. </p> <p>The metal discs can be left in the passport or hung around the neck, and are designed to withstand a fire or bomb blast. </p> <p>One of the major problems confronting emergency workers at the Beslan siege, in which at least 329 people, including 150 children, died, was identifying the dead and the needs of the wounded. </p> <p>The distribution of \u00a311m in aid has been delayed because the authorities are struggling to work out who was in the school. </p> <p>More than 60 bodies remain unidentified because of the level of disfigurement caused by the blast. </p> <p>The passport will contain simple instructions of what to do in the event of a flood, fire, road accident, metro emergency or terrorist attack. </p> <p>Valeri Muliar, of the Moscow Duma's security and legislation committee, helped devise the passport. </p> <p>He said it contained the following advice for a terrorist attack: \"Keep calm. Remember: help will come. If you hear shooting, lie on the floor. Cover your head with arms or satchel. Try to keep away from the windows and doors.\" </p> <p>Mr Muliar said: \"Detailed instructions will also be given by a teacher who would explain how to keep calm, what kind of help will come and what is the right way to behave.\" </p> <p>He said officials were also working on a booklet designed to offer children further advice on how to deal with a terrorist attack. </p> <p>Security measures around schools in North Caucuses have been strengthened since the Beslan tragedy. Police officers, armed with an AK47 automatic rifle, are stationed outside most schools. </p> <p>However, it was not clear when the passports would be introduced in the North Caucuses region. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The grief of the relatives of those who died in the Beslan attack in North Ossetia could explode into violence against their neighbours when mourning ends, a former negotiator from the siege said yesterday. </p> <p>\"The situation is balanced between war and peace,\" said Ruslan Aushev, the ex-president of Ingushetia, which borders the North Ossetia region. </p> <p>Mr Aushev walked alone into the school on the second day of the siege and persuaded militants to free 25 people, mostly infants.</p>",
  "<p>About 350 pupils got an unscheduled day off today after an exotic spider forced a school to shut. </p> <p>The pupils ,at Whitelands Park primary school, in Thatcham, Berkshire, were sent home after the eight-legged intruder yesterday crawled from a set of drums brought in from Senegal for a music workshop. </p> <p>Pest control officials were fumigating the premises today to flush out the speckled brown spider, said to be as big as an adult's palm. </p> <p>\"The spider was spotted yesterday when it fell out of a set of drums,\" said Keith Ulyatt, spokesman for West Berkshire local education authority. </p> <p>\"It was spotted by a classroom assistant, but as she turned her back to get a container to trap it, the spider ran off.\" </p> <p>Experts at London Zoo said it was probably a tropical house spider, which can cause a \"nasty reaction\" with its bite. </p> <p>Mr Ulyatt said the decision to fumigate the school for seven to 11-year-olds was taken as a precaution. </p> <p>He added: \"The full fumigation will take place this afternoon and the pupils will be allowed back to school tomorrow morning. \"The school may smell a bit funny but the chemicals used are completely safe for humans - just not for spiders.\"</p>",

  "<p>Power distribution charges, which account for 25-30% of household electricity bills, will be higher over the next five years than originally planned to allow greater investment in networks and cover extra tax and pension costs, the energy regulator Ofgem said yesterday. </p> <p>Ofgem said distribution charges should rise in line with inflation from 2005, reversing plans for a cap on prices announced in June, after it was persuaded of higher costs and the need for more spending on local grids. </p> <p>The proposals, which will be finalised in November, were criticised by power companies as too small, but analysts said they would boost income. </p> <p>\"[The] update indicates additional revenue for all of the companies. This increases revenues on average by 2%,\" said Fraser McLaren, an analyst at ING. </p> <p>Ofgem said capital investment for the five years would rise 46% over the level in the current price-control period, due to end next year. Operating expenditure allowances, to cover day-to-day costs, had been raised 8% in comparison with the initial proposals, although this still represented an overall reduction on current levels. </p> <p>United Utilities said the revision would increase revenues by \u00a395m, helping to cover pension and tax costs, but did not \"adequately compensate investors for the risk contained within the updated proposals\".</p>",
  "<p>Campaign group Liberty has warned of a potential human rights breach should Britain wave through the \"fast track\" extradition to the US of three former NatWest bankers accused of conspiring with Enron fraudsters to cheat the bank of $20m (\u00a311m). </p> <p>The group has written to Bow Street magistrates court ahead of an extradition hearing starting this morning, pointing out that the alleged crime substantially took place in the UK, and that the defendants and the bank are British. </p> <p>Gary Mulgrew, David Bermingham and Giles Darby are said to have duped NatWest of $7.3m four years ago. They are accused of hatching a plot with former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow and his righhand man Michael Kopper - though they are not implicated in the fraud that led to the collapse of the energy trader. </p> <p>Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti called on the British authorities to explain their reasons for not bringing a case against the former bankers in the UK. </p> <p>\"One cannot help worrying that we are letting the Americans 'get on with it' - that is not a good enough explanation for taking people away from their families.\" </p> <p>Article 8 of the European convention on human rights sets out a right to respect for an individual's family and private life. It is thought the bankers will be detained in the US should the extradition request from the department of justice prove successful. </p> <p>\"These are real human beings - with families and lives here. It is pretty serious to be wafted to the other side of the world,\" Ms Chakrabarti said. \"Is it necessary and proportionate for them to be dragged from their homes in Britain when everything is said to have happened over here?\" </p> <p>Liberty has taken an interest in the case after campaigning against elements of the Extradition Act which became law this year. The act does not require the US to set out a prima facie case to secure extradition. </p> <p>Details of the NatWest bankers' actions came to light during interviews they gave voluntarily to the Financial Services Authority after US regulators announced they had begun investigating Enron in 2001. </p> <p>The FSA passed transcripts and other information to the US securities and exchange commission. Together with admissions from Fastow and Kopper, the transcripts form the bulk of evidence against the bankers. </p> <p>At no point have they admitted misconduct but the FSA is understood to have told them they could face legal action in Britain should the US fail to secure extradition. </p> <p>The FSA declined to comment on the bankers' case but made clear any decision to allow overseas proceedings to take priority always took account of where the alleged offence took place; the nationality of the victim; likely difficulties in accessing crucial evidence; and the existence of more advanced investigations by overseas authorities. </p> <p>Fastow and Kopper have pleaded guilty to their part in the alleged fraud on NatWest, through which they shared $12.3m, and have signed plea-bargain agreements.</p>",
  "<p>After months of wrangling, sofa magnate Lord Kirkham has succeeded in his \u00a3507m bid to take the DFS upholstery chain private. </p> <p>The Tory peer, who founded DFS in 1969 and floated it on the stock market 10 years ago, yesterday told an extraordinary meeting that 80% of shareholders had backed his bid. That was 5% more than the minimum he required to press ahead, and came after leading investors criticised his original offer for being too low. In the event he had to raise his bid twice to gain the acceptance he needed. </p> <p>The main opposition to the bid came from two institutions, Morley and M&amp;G, which between them hold 13% of DFS. Opponents suggested Lord Kirkham, whose personal fortune is estimated at more than \u00a3400m, was choosing a moment of relative weakness in DFS's affairs to buy it back on the cheap. </p> <p>In April, the firm reported a slump in first-half profits and issued its third profit warning in six months. But senior independent non-executive director Michael Blackburn, who headed negotiations for DFS, said yesterday: \"The size of the vote in favour speaks for itself as far as that debate is concerned.\" </p> <p>Lord Kirkham raised his initial 415p a share offer in March to 445p and then 450p at the beginning of this month. The City expected a close result, with Lord Kirkham needing 75% support to succeed (not including his 10% holding). </p> <p>But his opponents began to lose ground following profit warnings from retailers such as Courts and MFI, news that some institutions were selling out ahead of yesterday's meeting and suggestions Lord Kirkham might walk away if he lost. </p> <p>Lord Kirkham said a return to family control would revive \"basic South Yorkshire values\" and end City pressure for constant growth. </p> <p>He will take the reins in November, with his son Michael, 37, who is doing his time as a shopfloor salesman in the firm's Rotherham store, earmarked for future succession. The move ends a brief but profitable spell as a public company that has seen DFS triple in size to an annual turnover of more than \u00a3500m with 70 outlets employing 2,500 staff. </p> <p>\"It's been a benign period but everything suggests that the next 10 years won't be anything like as benign,\" said Lord Kirkham after the vote was announced at a Doncaster hotel. </p> <p>\"The great advantage of being private again is that we can be less transparent - we don't have to let our rivals know the secrets of our success. We can also have a quiet period without constant pressure for growth. That means less turnover in staff, all being well, which is how I like to see things. </p> <p>\"I'm very conscious of our origins and the fact that we've done well with South Yorkshire values - being down-to-earth, a very strong work ethic and loyalty, and knowing the value of money. I've never got used to City people saying: 'But Graham, it's only another \u00a31m ... \" </p> <p>Lord Kirkham marked his 1994 flotation of DFS by spending \u00a33.5m on a Thomas Gainsborough painting called Peasants Going to Market - a quip about his origins as a self-made man from a Doncaster mining family. </p> <p>He said yesterday: \"I've not had time to study the art market this time, but let me know if there's anything around with a title such as Going Private.\" </p> <p>He acknowledged that the buyback would end staff shareholding, which has been important to DFS's \"family values\" with a high proportion of employees working for the firm since it was founded - as Northern Upholstery - nearly 35 years ago. </p> <p>Lord Kirkham said: \"We believe very much in this and we will be introducing better replacement schemes as part of the rearrangements.\" </p> <p>He also agreed that the move was not a case of \"with one bound we're free\", as the bid has been made with loans including \u00a3360m from Nomura bank on top of Lord Kirkham's personal investment of \u00a3135m. </p> <p>He said: \"We're going to have to get used to living with loan repayments, which is something new for us. We'll start a step at a time and see how things go.\" </p> <p>The firm is not expected to make any radical changes, however, and Lord Kirkham, 59, plans to be in charge for a good while. \"I like the challenge, and our business has moved into very challenging times. It's far more competitive and the economic context isn't going to be easy too.\" </p> <p>Richard Ratner, retail analyst at Seymour Pierce, said the vote was sensible and Lord Kirkham was DFS's main asset. He said: \"Were he to have walked away - and being exceedingly wealthy he could have done so - then it would have been very difficult to find anyone with the necessary merchandising skills to replace him.\"</p>",
  "<p>Clothing maker Tommy Hilfiger suffered a mauling on Wall Street yesterday after disclosing it was the subject of a federal investigation that analysts said appeared to focus on tax avoidance. </p> <p>Its shares were down 24% at mid-day, changing hands at $10. </p> <p>The company said the investigation was focusing on the level of commissions paid to an overseas division for product development, sourcing, production scheduling and quality control. The inquiry was trying to establish whether the size of the commission was appropriate. It would not comment further. </p> <p>\"We believe the investigators are looking into whether Tommy Hilfiger has been shifting around income to avoid paying taxes,\" said Prudential Equity Group analyst Lizabeth Dunn. </p> <p>She said the potential liability, in back taxes and fines, would be more than $100m (\u00a355m), using up the fashion group's cash balance. Ms Dunn cut her 12-month target price for the shares from $18 to $8. </p> <p>Merrill Lynch analyst Virginia Genereux said the commissions paid to offices in Asia \"effectively shifted profits to lower tax jurisdictions\". </p> <p>In the last quarter, Tommy Hilfiger reported a $7.6m loss.</p>",
  "We should take seriously the growing number of reports that anti-terrorist measures fall disproportionately on members of our Muslim community. It is easy to understand how, in the wake of the Bigley affair, the Russian school massacre, and even the invasion of our own House of Commons, the niceties of liberal procedures are seen as obstacles to the \"war\" on terror. <p>It is, sadly, true that nowadays no society - democratic or repressive - is immune from increasingly inventive forms of deadly assault. But it is not true that liberal societies are helpless in the face of terrorist attacks. Our Human Rights Act permits the limitation of a number of its designated liberties when national security demands it. However, the difference between us and authoritarian countries is that our anti-terrorist measures must be proportionate to the danger posed and should not undermine the essence of democratic practice. </p> <p>The precise extent of any limitation on our procedural safeguards is always difficult to establish. But democracies should not allow potentially innocent people to be held for long periods without a trial, or to be humiliated or damaged by torture. Once a democratic country closes down free expression, or begins to discriminate against certain minorities, the bright distinction between its values and those of authoritarian regimes will soon dim. As a US supreme court justice, John Paul Stevens, said in a recent case about conditions at Guant\u00e1namo Bay: \"We must not wield the tools of tyranny even to resist the forces of tyranny.\" </p> <p>The feature that distinguishes Britain and other democracies most clearly from tyrannical states is the independence of the judiciary, which should not lightly be challenged. David Blunkett has frequently berated judges who have held against his department. And he recently threatened to exclude any judicial review in asylum cases. Similarly, when Michael Howard was home secretary, he challenged the judiciary and is now leading the Conservatives in an attack upon an alleged surfeit of claims under the Human Rights Act and what he calls the \"compensation culture\". More subtly, both sides of the political spectrum are seeking to downplay rights in favour of so-called public duties. </p> <p>Both Blunkett and Howard are wrong. For a start, human rights litigation is not multiplying exponentially. Do not believe the anecdote about the burglar who successfully sued the owner of a home he ransacked after falling through a defective skylight. It is true that, prior to the introduction of the Human Rights Act, the committee set up to anticipate its impact on court business believed it was likely to stimulate a \"flood\" of new cases. But nothing of that scale has taken place. Nor has the dire prediction that the act would serve as a \"villain's charter\" remotely been fulfilled. </p> <p>It is certainly the case that judges have, over the years, limited the unfettered rights of ministers. Until recently, when parliament conferred discretion upon a minister in broad terms (to act \"in the public interest\" or \"as he sees fit\"), his actions were virtually immune from judicial challenge. Nowadays, our courts require public officials to have greater respect for the people they serve - for example, by providing a fair hearing before limiting rights or interests. Even so, the judges have been remarkably restrained about interfering with the substance of discretionary decisions by ministers. So we should welcome the judicial development of principles of good public administration and accountability. </p> <p>The argument for duties rather than rights is another red herring. Of course we should encourage a notion of civic duty in a general sense. But civic virtues cannot easily be legislated. The old Soviet constitutions used to impose a catalogue of vague obligations upon citizens (such as the duty to go to the aid of anyone in distress). Because they were not enforceable, they diminished respect for the constitutions. In any event, our most important duties are to respect the rights of others. </p> <p>Instead of belittling rights and judges, Blunkett and Howard could take a leaf out of Nelson Mandela's book. Shortly after he became president, one of his decisions was struck down by South Africa's new constitutional court. He immediately welcomed the judgment, saying it established from the outset that in the new South Africa no one was above the law, and that the judges were the final arbiters of the constitution. </p> <p>In the heat of the vital battle against new and fearsome forms of attack, it is tempting to tolerate an erosion of equality and liberty. However, these principles are hard-won cornerstones of our democracy, which must also be heavily defended against the terrorist threat. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Jeffrey Jowell QC is professor of public law at University College London, and a vice-president of the Council of Europe's Commission for Democracy Through Law </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.jowell@ucl.ac.uk\">j.jowell@ucl.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<b> Mind your language</b> <br> <p><b> I can read a rainbow</b><br> </p> <p>As obsessions go, Ian Paterson's is fairly harmless. Unless you're into saving rainforests. For Paterson is a man fixated on words, and that manifests itself in the form of dictionaries. Hundreds of them. </p> <p>Eight hundred and fifty volumes of dictionaries line the walls of Paterson's study, and he takes great delight in each of them. \"The whole ethos of a good dictionary is to get sucked into it,\" he enthuses. \"You go from definition to definition and you're always learning.\" </p> <p>The passion began when Paterson was 11 and was given a small Collins English Gem Dictionary (naturally, he still has it). \"People thought I was studying the Bible, I got so fixated,\" he says, somewhat frighteningly. \"But to be able to express oneself correctly is such a pleasure. I like clarity and to be unambiguous in what I'm saying. The dictionaries give me the means to achieve that.\" </p> <p>Now Paterson has turned his magnificent obsession into his very own book of words, the world's first Dictionary of Colour. \"I've always been obsessed by colours, too,\" he says, as if his fascinations make perfect sense. \"I'm obsessed by what colour means, how we perceive it, the effect it has on the brain, how there are so many phrases tied up with it. We simply can't express ourselves without colour.\" </p> <p>Marrying his two passions - words and colour - took Paterson five years. He trawled newspapers, fiction and non-fiction books for colour references, and even visited DIY stores for colour charts. The result, as it says on the book's cover, is a \"lexicon of the language of colour\". </p> <p>The book spans simple explanations of words connected in any way with colours (including one of Paterson's favourites, leucippotomy, or the art of carving white horses on a hillside), to colour phrases (such as \"black as the inside of a cow\", a sailor's eloquent way of expressing nil visibility) and adjectives (from academy and china blue to lily white). It reveals that there are more than 200 words for the colour blue. </p> <p>Paterson works full time as a corporate lawyer; his passion - along with his weekly game of Scrabble and his daily crossword - is an extracurricular activity. It may seem bizarre to some, but Paterson sees it differently. </p> <p>\"It puzzles me when other people aren't interested in this book,\" says the author in all innocence. \"It is exactly the kind of thing that I would like to read.\"<br> <b>Sarah Ebner</b> </p> <p><b> Departure lounge</b><br> </p> <p><b> The 9.15 to Mars will be delayed</b><br> </p> <p> It probably wasn't a great idea for Richard Branson to launch his new space travel venture, Virgin Galactic, on the same day that the Virgin Trains winter timetable was introduced. \"Today is a historic day - it will bring the dream of space travel for many millions closer to reality,\" trumpeted Sir Richard yesterday at the launch of his space flight service (at \u00a3110,000 for a two-hour trip, it's fractionally more expensive than the first-class fare to Birmingham). Unfortunately, back on earth, the 9.49 Virgin train from Glasgow to London was stuck at Carlisle because of \"wheel flattening\" and the 5.28 from Holyhead to London was running 31 minutes late because of electrical problems. Alpha Centauri, here we come, though there will be a short delay at Crewe. </p> <p>It may be worrying for Virgin Galactic that extensive Guardian market research at Euston station (OK, me with a notepad, waylaying passengers on the concourse) revealed little appetite for space travel. In part, of course, it is a question of cost: people with \u00a3110,000 to spare are unlikely to be waiting for the delayed 16.48 to Manchester. As a student called Nick said, only \"celebs and the super-rich\" will be flying Virgin Galactic. </p> <p>But it seemed to be more than a question of cash. \"What on earth is the point of going into space?\" asked Peter, a retired printer. \"It's a trip to nowhere. I'm happy in North Wales.\" </p> <p>\"It's a bit far-fetched,\" said a BT bid manager called Elaine with characteristic Lancastrian earthiness. \"In any case, Virgin should concentrate on trains. I was 10 minutes late this morning and it looks like this one will be half an hour late.\" </p> <p>\"It doesn't have the least appeal to me,\" said a consultant project manager called Alan. \"But I'm sure they'll make it work by giving it priority. When Tony Blair took the new train to Manchester the other day, everything else was pushed out of the way to make sure it got in on time.\" </p> <p>\"I've got better things to do with \u00a3110,000,\" said Andy, a company director. \"In any case, Branson's struggled with trains and there's no guarantee he'll be any better with spaceships.\" </p> <p>Denis and Oliver, two young Mancunians, went further. \"The service is a disgrace. There hasn't even been an improvement with the tilting trains. He doesn't have a sniff of a chance of getting people into space.\" At least not on time and with a supply of hot drinks in the buffet car.<br> <b>Stephen Moss</b> </p> <p><b> Performing arts</b><br> </p> <p><b> Welcome back, Donny</b><br> </p> <p>When you are a rock critic, there are certain things you shouldn't admit to. Having a private education. Failing to take large quantities of drugs (it's like politics in reverse: I did inhale, honest). And being a fan of Donny Osmond. I'm Tim, I'm a rock critic, and I'm guilty on all three counts. </p> <p>Britain awoke yesterday to find Donny back in the top 10 after a 28-year gap. The news brought faint palpitations to millions of women in their 40s - and me. In 1972, I was Donny's biggest male fan, and possibly his smallest too. He was 14; I was 10. They tried to tell us we were too young. </p> <p>His favourite colour was purple; so was mine. He wore his hair like headphones over his ears; so did I. He wore tank tops; I had a purple one for children's parties. Discounting the fact that he was a Mormon from Utah with eight siblings, there was just one major difference between us: he was a handsome pop star, and I was a chubby, bespectacled swot who looked like a bank manager. </p> <p>The pop bug was the obvious life-style choice for a 10-year-old, unless you were at boarding school. At mine, other boys put up posters of Martin Chivers of Spurs and Ben Murphy from Alias Smith &amp; Jones. I put up the Osmonds: posters, photos, clippings, magazines that opened into posters, and (the killer touch) home-made bar graphs of their chart positions. This was considered so start-ling that my cubicle became a stop on the headmaster's tour for prospective parents. What it was meant to illustrate I still can't work out. </p> <p>The motives behind my fandom are a mystery. I liked the tunes (\"Crazeh! Hosses!\"), but no more than Blockbuster or The Jean Genie. If it was a crush, it was like no other. Perhaps it was just that the Osmonds were a blast of the world outside. The papers compared it to Beatlemania. I was excited by the excitement, as a girl fan might have been in love with being in love. </p> <p>In time, I moved on to higher things: Wizzard, Wings, ELO. And Donny moved into telly, musicals and multiple fatherhood. Then, in 1987, I met him. It was in the hospitality area at a Madonna gig at Wembley. Rather ineptly, I came out with: \"I used to be a big fan of yours.\" He produced a big American smile and a firm American thank-you. His reappearance in the charts has various causes, from tireless touring to the internet's ability to reach the faithful, but don't underestimate his manners. Neither bitter nor twisted, he's an anti-Jacko. </p> <p>His new hit was co-written by Gary Barlow of Take That.

But hey, how much money can you waste on gadgets? Well, thanks to a new study, we know exactly: \u00a33bn. If we had any sense we would club together and spend it all on one single enormous useless gadget we would never use, like a regional parliament, or an Olympic Games. </p> <p>For the last couple of years we've been hearing about people caught in the terrible lure of easy credit who are all going to come to a sticky end. Well, if people are going to spend \u00a33bn on electric knives, they deserve it. </p> <p>For example, despite the fact that about 99% of the population of the UK is on the Atkins diet, 14% of us own a breadmaker - you know, that thing that takes up ridiculous amounts of space and was used once, then someone dropped walnuts in it and now it sits, bulkily reproving you for your lack of home-making skills. </p> <p>How did this come about? There is either some secret coercive technique known only to middle-aged ladies who demonstrate gadgets in the basements of overheated department stores, or - and I'm more inclined towards this explanation - this is further evidence of Britain's out-of-control drinking culture, whereby people come home a bit scooshed and start messing about on eBay. </p> <p>All gadgets are of course, useless. After all, what's the first thing you say after a hard day? Is it: \"Hi darling. I'm just going up to the attic to unpack that blue plastic foot spa thingy, fill it with water, unclog the holes, pour washing-up liquid in it then let it slosh all over the living room carpet\"? or: \"Hey, I'm just going to run a bath!\" </p> <p>There is one exception to the rule: the humble toastie machine, bought and greviously neglected by a whopping 40% of us.

  "French police protested yesterday after Hannibal, the son of the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, was allowed to go free after being clocked at more than 87mph on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. <p>\"This is a genuine scandal,\" said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lagache of the biggest police union, Alliance, when it emerged that Mr Gadafy, 28, had not been charged after he presented his diplomatic passport. </p> <p>\"The behaviour of people who represent their country should be exemplary and above reproach,\" he said. </p> <p>\"There is a real problem here: diplomatic immunity should not mean that certain people simply become above the law.\" </p> <p>Mr Gadafy was stopped in his Porsche at 2.45am on Saturday, a police spokesman said. </p> <p>He had been caught driving down France's most famous avenue at more than three times the legal speed limit, jumping at least three red lights in the process. </p> <p>A bodyguard travelling with Mr Gadafy tried to stop the officers questioning him. Two separate cars, carrying six more guards, arrived on the scene \"very quickly\", a police spokesman said. </p> <p>After police reinforcements arrived, \"things got quite heated quite fast\", the spokesman added. </p> <p>\"There was a bit of a scuffle. One of the officers took a heavy punch; he's been given a doctor's certificate ordering him not to go back to work for four days.\" </p> <p>Le Figaro newspaper quoted police as saying the interior of Mr Gadafy's car smelled of alcohol and that he was \"unable to speak coherently\". </p> <p>A \u20ac4,500 (\u00a33,063) police radio transmitter was wrecked during the fight. </p> <p>Two bodyguards were arrested but released on Saturday morning after a visit from Mr Gadafy and officials from the Libyan embassy who reportedly apologised for the incident. </p> <p>One of the security men, who was not identified, is due to appear in court on October 15 charged with causing bodily harm to a police officer. </p> <p>Three years ago, Mr Gadafy was accused of attacking three Italian policemen with a fire extinguisher while on holiday in a luxury hotel in Rome. He is also alleged to have been involved in a brawl in Rome that reportedly left six photographers in hospital. </p> <p>The incident is unlikely to endear him to his father, who is trying to repair strained relations with Europe and the US.

  "Under a nearly full moon, rebel fighters leapt on to the sand from the back of their battle-wagon; a Toyota pick-up truck with a machine gun on its cab and an anti-tank missile launcher slung from the wing mirror. The moonlight picked out every rock, bush and dune for miles, but these men had no fear of being seen or heard. <p>This region of north-western Darfur is controlled by the Sudan Liberation Army, the rebel movement which prompted the Sudanese government to unleash the Janjaweed militia. </p> <p>A ceasefire was agreed in April, but it has been repeatedly violated by both sides; on Sunday, two policemen were shot dead in a rebel attack on a police post in south Darfur. Peace talks in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, collapsed a fortnight ago over a rebel demand that the Janjaweed disarm before they do. </p> <p>In the SLA's camps, there is no talk of peace. Young men from Darfur's shattered villages have come to find an outlet for their rage. </p> <p>Khalid, who wore a camouflage vest and a long knife at his waist, said: \"I am very angry because my father was killed, and one of my brothers, and my uncle. In the refugee camps, I have no work to do. I want to fight.\" He claimed to be 15 but looked younger. Rebel officers have refused to let him join up because they say he is too young, but he will not go to live with his mother who is in a refugee camp in Chad. Instead, he helps fetch firewood and carry water for the fighters. </p> <p>The war in Darfur began last April, when the SLA raided the town of El Fashir, the capital of north Darfur, where fighters captured some military officers and destroyed a number of warplanes. </p> <p>In retaliation, the regime in Khartoum armed the traditional militias of the Arab tribes in Darfur, which have come to be known as the Janjaweed, and gave them air support to attack the villages from which the rebels drew their backing. A million people have been driven from their homes and nearly 200,000 more have fled across into Chad. But the rebels have not been defeated. Instead, they have found fresh recruits as a result of the government's onslaught. </p> <p>One such recruit is Ismail, 22, a tall man in a grey tunic who joined after the Janjaweed killed his family last July. </p> <p>\"At the time I didn't know who the SLA were,\" he said at a rebel camp in Darfur. \"After they killed my father and mother, and my two brothers, I heard that there were people who were fighting against the government. I kept asking for them until I arrived at a [rebel] camp. Now I'm fighting the Janjaweed.\" He was a cowherd before the war. Now he carries an American-made automatic rifle and an ammunition belt with cotton pouches tied around his chest. Looped beneath the belt are strings of leather pouches holding lucky charms. Each talisman protects against a different menace: scorpions, snakes and bullets. </p> <p>The rebellion is well-equipped. There are Kalashnikovs, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, anti-tank missiles and Belgian-made automatic rifles. </p> <p>The rebels say all their weapons are looted from the Sudanese military, but they admit buying camouflage uniforms on the black market from Chadian soldiers. This may also be a route for weapons. </p> <p>The backs of their pick-ups are loaded with drums of petrol and there are several boxes which they describe as \"medicines\", but from their weight appear to be ammunition. </p> <p>Rebel officers call each other on satellite phones, paying with phonecards sent from fundraising offices in Europe and the Gulf. Some funds come from expatriate Darfuri communities but the war also sustains itself through looting. </p> <p>The SLA's strategy is to mount hit-and-run raids, striking at government convoys, checkpoints, or at towns when they have the strength. </p> <p>The aim is to disrupt supply lines, destroy the Sudanese military's equipment, and steal weapons, ammunition, cars, food and medicines for their effort. They cannot hold on to towns or villages because they cannot fight the government's air power. </p> <p>The rebels have attacked mainly military targets, but are also accused of intimidating local civilian leaders who cooperate with the government. In April a tribal leader was abducted and murdered by the SLA after accepting food aid from the government. </p> <p>The rebellion has brought ruin on the people they claim to be fighting for, but the fighters are unrepentant. </p> <p>One of their officers, Izzedine Yahya Hamid, 25, said the choice was between exile or death at the hands of a government bent on their destruction. \"If we fight then our people will become refugees. But if we do not fight, then our people will be killed by the government of [Sudanese president Omar] el-Bashir and the Janjaweed.\" </p> <p>Mr Hamid, a former medical student who spoke fluent English, sketched a map of Sudan on a sheet of paper. He marked Darfur on the map, then pointed to other zones of rebellion; the south, where a peace deal has been concluded after 21 years of civil war, the centre, where the Nuba people have clashed with the government, and the east, where the Beja people are threatening fresh strife. </p> <p>Then he drew a circle north of Khartoum to show where the Arab tribes who dominate the country originate from. </p> <p>\"We don't hope to be independent,\" he said. \"We just hope that Sudan will become a new Sudan, with the Nuba people, and the people in the south and our people all balanced. But not the Janjaweed, because they are criminals.\" </p> <p>For some, the rebellion is an adventure. Many young men in Darfur are accustomed to living a semi-nomadic lifestyle. Living in a rebel encampment is not far removed from this. </p> <p>There is laughter and camaraderie here, and a freedom they do not enjoy in the crowded refugee camps. </p> <p>But it is noticeable that among the younger fighters, there are far fewer smiles and little laughter. A generation is being reared in an atmosphere of hatred and violence. The longer the war goes on, the more brutalised its fighters will become.</p>",
  "He was bigger, she was deeper. He drew himself as a faun, she drew herself as a nun. He drank, ate and rollicked on an epic scale, she sometimes starved alone in her room. Both enormously admired one another's work. <p>A comparison of Gwen John and her brother Augustus opens at Tate Britain this week, the first since their deaths. \"This was supposed to be a small, rather quiet exhibition, but the level of interest is extraordinary,\" said the Tate's director, Stephen Deuchar, yesterday. \"We may be in for a bit of a shock.\" </p> <p>The curator, David Fraser Jenkins, said: \"His best portraits are astonishing, better and better the longer you look at them, while her late work shows an extraordinarily modern engagement with the whole process of painting.\" </p> <p>The exhibition includes her only known image of him, in the background of a group of Slade art school friends, leaning on a mantelpiece wearing a straw hat at a rakish angle. </p> <p>Gwen's meekness, as seen in her brother's portraits and in her selfportraits, was deceptive. When one critic called her pictures \"quiet and sad\", speculating that the artist must be too, Augustus wrote to protest. </p> <p>He did not point out, as he might have, that she had earned her living as a nude model in Paris, and was not only the model but the lover of the sculptor Rodin. </p> <p>For most of their lives it seemed beyond question that he was the greater. She died in 1939, and he in 1961. </p> <p>Since then her reputation has risen steadily, while his has gone into freefall - partly because his output was so vast, and the quality so varied, that even Mr Fraser Jenkins calls some of his female portraits \"slickly over-sexed\". </p> <p>The reversal in fact began in 1926, in the only joint exhibition in their lifetimes; for the first time, her work was more admired than his. Country Life said: \"She is a sort of modern Vermeer.\" </p> <p>The Tate Britain show has a wall of works by both artists of \"Dorelia\", Dorothy McNeill. She was model, muse, cook, costumier, mother of a tribe of children, and general nanny to Augustus and his wife, Ida - but she also ran off with Gwen to France for a year. </p> <p>Towards the end of her life, Gwen painted small studies in muted colours. Augustus often painted to match his lifestyle. Two vast works are on show: Galway, a triptych in the Tate's possession for 80 years but rarely shown due to lack of space; and The Mumpers (an old word for beggars), a vast, brilliant canvas that is awkward for its museum in Detroit to show and has not been seen in Britain since 1915. In its day, The Mumpers was compared, favourably, with Matisse's The Dance, now seen as a quintessential image of 20th century art. </p> <p>However, not everyone agreed, and his sitters were not always enraptured with how he saw them. In 1907 Lady Gregory commissioned him to portray WB Yeats. He displayed the poet in an open collared shirt, with sensuous red lips, glittering dark eyes, and a lock of black hair falling over a noble white brow - \"every inch the poet of the twilight\", as John recorded. Yeats was appalled: the work, he said, made him \"a sheer tinker; drunken, unpleasant and disreputable\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Gwen John and Augustus John, Tate Britain until January 9</p>",
  "The man charged with murdering the British backpacker Caroline Stuttle admitted to killing her during a bungled bag snatch, a court in Bundaberg, Australia, heard yesterday. <p>Ian Douglas Previte, 32, confessed to a fellow inmate at Rockhampton prison in Queensland and later admitted in a police interview that the 19-year-old had died during the robbery on April 10 2002, according to the prosecutor Peter Feeney. </p> <p>Ms Stuttle, of York, was several months into a gap year in Australia when she died after falling from Bundaberg's Burnett river bridge into parkland nine metres (30ft) below. </p> <p>The jury was told that Mr Previte had admitted struggling with Ms Stuttle as he attempted to snatch her bag, but denied throwing her over the railings at the edge of the parapet. </p> <p>Mr Feeney said the railings were almost as tall as Ms Stuttle. He said it had been a cool, clear night as the woman headed home to a caravan park shortly after 9pm, after making a call to her boyfriend, Ian Nelson, from the city centre post office. </p> <p>Her travelling companion, Sarah Holiday, had called to check on her during the 50-minute call and Ms Stuttle promised to signal that she was coming home by dialling Ms Holiday's mobile phone and letting it ring twice. Mr Feeney said she had done this at 9.18pm, when the call to Mr Nelson ended. </p> <p>\"About nine minutes after Caroline left the post office ... she called again. She called Sarah's mobile and said in a hurried voice, 'Come and meet me,' and then the call ends.\" </p> <p>Mr Feeney said Mr Previte had followed her across the bridge and confronted her towards the end of it, just a few metres from where the call appeared to have been made. </p> <p>Police leads had run cold by January 2003, when Mr Previte confessed to the fellow prisoner, Jason Lilburn. Investigators secretly recorded a conversation between the two men the next month. </p> <p>Asked by Lilburn if he would claim the killing was an accident, Mr Previte said: \"Yes, that's what I'm going to use ... It'll drop down to facing manslaughter.\" </p> <p>Mr Feeney explained how Mr Previte had confessed to the killing in a taped interview with police soon afterwards. </p> <p>\"I was underneath the bridge crossing over,\" he said. \"I wanted to do a snatch, she gave up a fight, she went over the railing, pretty much.\" </p> <p>The jury of seven men and five women was told that Mr Previte was on a methadone programme at the time of the attack and had also been taking the tranquilliser Seroxat, morphine and cannabis. </p> <p>He had been smoking cannabis in a pipe close to the bridge when Ms Stuttle walked past. </p> <p>Mr Previte, in a white shirt and with close-cropped blond hair, pleaded not guilty to the two charges of robbery with violence and murder. The judge, Peter Dutney, warned the jury against making quick judgments. </p> <p>\"You are not simply individuals,\" he said. </p> <p>\"You represent the community and you represent its sense of justice. Justice is not served by finding a scapegoat.\" </p> <p>A forensic pathologist, Rosemary Ashby, said Ms Stuttle had died from injuries to the spine and left side of her body caused by her fall from the bridge. </p> <p>But she said bruising and scratches on the right side of the body and a missing tooth were consistent with a violent struggle before she fell. </p> <p>Earlier, Ms Stuttle's brother Richard visited the spot at the foot of the bridge where his sister fell to her death. </p> <p>A photograph of her with five friends on her last day at school had been placed among the garlands there. \"It's the last place that Caroline was resting on this planet,\" he said. </p> <p>\"You still get the same emotion, the same welling up inside ... Each time it still pulls the heartstrings.\" </p> <p>In court, he rested his face in his hands as photographs of his sister's body lying in the parkland were shown. </p> <p>The prosecution will call 85 witnesses during the three-week trial. </p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "When Darren Surutan stood trial in 2002 for the manslaughter of his partner, Sarah Lee, no fewer than 10 medical experts gave evidence on two simple issues: how many bruises were on the victim's face, and had Lee, an alcoholic, acquired them in a fall or been assaulted by the accused? The experts gave profoundly conflicting medical evidence. Last May, the appeal court quashed Surutan's conviction, on the grounds that the jury, with inadequate guidance from the judge, would have been thoroughly confused by the deep disagreements between the experts. <p>Two months later, Sion Jenkins' 1998 conviction for murdering his foster daughter Billie-Jo was quashed when the court of appeal ruled that new forensic evidence made his conviction unsafe. Jenkins is on conditional bail with a retrial date provisionally set for April. </p> <p>Other high-profile cases, including those of Angela Cannings and Sally Clark, freed after their convictions for murdering their babies were overturned, have put a question mark over the way in which forensic evidence is used. Public belief in experts appears to be at an all-time low, as acknowledged by the Expert Witness Institute in publicity material for its conference next month. Noting that \"expert evidence is under attack\", it exhorts prospective attendees to \"come along ... and help us restore public confidence in expert witnesses\". </p> <p>Jane Hickman, a criminal defence solicitor and secretary of the Criminal Appeal Lawyers Association (Cala), agrees that the system is flawed. \"No one asks, 'How far should we go with forensic evidence?' and it's increasingly becoming the whole story in a trial. The trend, as science advances, is for the Crown to adduce evidence that is not sufficiently developed. Juries are being asked to draw conclusions that the evidence can't bear.\" And in a political climate where defendants are seen as getting off lightly, ever more esoteric expert evidence can, according to Hickman, unduly sway a jury. \"There are more and more branches of expertise being proclaimed. It is a very worrying development.\" </p> <p>Her views are echoed by Patrick O'Connor QC, who has represented defendants in the Guildford Four, Birmingham Six, and other miscarriage of justice cases. O'Connor, a speaker next weekend at another conference on expert evidence, hosted by Cala, says: \"It's not that there is an objection to forensic evidence per se but where things go wrong is in the handling of that evidence in court. Very often these cases of so-called expert evidence are not based on science.\" </p> <p>One controversial area is ear-print identification. Last January Mark Dallagher was cleared in a retrial of murdering a 94-year-old woman, having made legal history in 1998 when he became the first man to be convicted of murder by ear-print evidence. A jury at Leeds crown court had found him guilty after hearing evidence from Cornelius van der Lugt, a former Dutch policeman, who said that Dallagher, a convicted burglar, had left ear-prints on the woman's window before breaking into her house. Subsequently, DNA analysis of ear-prints left at the murder scene undermined Van der Lugt's expert testimony. Following an appeal and a new police investigation the prosecution decided to offer no evidence against Dallagher. His counsel, James Sturman QC, told the court: \"This is another example of the dangers of the police following scientists too closely when the scientists are building a science, not following a science.\" </p> <p>Dallagher is not the only person to have been convicted on ear-print evidence. Albert James was found guilty of seven burglaries in 2000, with his ear-prints allegedly found on doors and windows. Ear-print identification has been used to obtain at least another three convictions. The English courts continue to allow such evidence even though it has been widely discredited in mainland Europe and America. </p> <p>Other controversial forms of expert evidence are also finding their way into the courts. The court of appeal recently considered three appeals concerning lip-reading from video footage. The defence team argued that this was a novel technique whose reliability was uncertain. They said that it should have been ruled inadmissible, or, if allowed, that the judge should have directed the jury on the potential weaknesses of such evidence. </p> <p>To no avail: the court disagreed, declaring that \"lip-reading from a video, like facial mapping, is, in our view, a species of real evidence. [We] are entirely satisfied that lip-reading evidence as to the contents of a videoed conversation is capable of passing the ordinary tests of relevance and reliability and therefore being potentially admissible in evidence.\" Nevertheless, the court warned \"as to its limitations and the concomitant risk of error\". </p> <p>Facial mapping - or \"imagery analysis\" - has been \"repeatedly upheld\" as a viable form of expert evidence, according to criminal barrister Henry Blaxland QC. It might be used when there is CCTV footage of, for example, a bank robbery but where the alleged robber's face is obscured. \"An expert will then review the video material and identify supposed similarities between the defendant's face and that of the person on film,\" says Blaxland, adding that, because of the lack of a database and a developed scientific discipline, he has always regarded it as \"dangerous.\" The court of appeal agreed in a case last year, saying, \"Unless and until a national database or agreed formula or some other such objective measure is established, this court doubts whether such opinions should ever be expressed by facial imaging or mapping witnesses.\" </p> <p>Blaxland agrees with O'Connor that the crucial issue is how expert evidence is used in court. O'Connor says there are three distinct problem areas: \"The first is that we have no certifying body for expert witnesses. A lot of so-called 'experts' have no real science qualifications and are not entitled to claim an aura of expertise. Second, we have no test for admissibility, in contrast to the situation in the United States where expert evidence has to be accepted as reliable by the scientific community before it can be used in court. This puts the defence in an impossible position - how do you counter an expert in an entirely new field with your own expert? Third, we have no way of dealing with maverick pronouncements by experts who should know better.\" </p> <p>O'Connor believes that there should be procedural barriers to prevent witnesses departing from their witness statements and suddenly introducing prejudicial material. He welcomes the suggestion by a working group of the Royal College of Pathologists and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health for a pre-trial review in criminal trials, in which experts can establish areas of agreement and disagreement. As O'Connor says, this means of \"protection against improvisation\" occurs in civil cases, so why not criminal ones too? </p> <p>Ewen Smith, a partner at the law firm Glaisyers who specialises in criminal law, is encouraged by what he sees as an \"increasing caution over experts\" in the court of appeal. Nevertheless, be believes the system needs an overhaul: \"Trial judges need to stop dubious expert evidence at the first hurdle, or at the very least caution juries as to its possible fallibility. The imbalance in funding also means that the Crown can call in as many experts as it wants at the outset, while the defence faces enormous financial restrictions. The system is flawed.\" </p> <p>At least, though, we have yet to reach the wilder shores of expert evidence. US \"experts\" have come up with \"in-custody death syndrome\", or \"excited delirium\", which argues that people who die in police custody are not victims of police brutality but rather of their own cocaine or amphetamine abuse, which can trigger this fatal condition. Then there is brain fingerprinting, whose advocates claim that it determines objectively what information is stored in a person's brain by measuring brainwave responses to relevant words or pictures flashed on a computer screen. A court in Iowa ruled that brain fingerprinting was admissible as scientific evidence after a test showing that the record stored in the brain of a man convicted of murder did not match the crime scene. Only in America?</p>",
  "I got a long-awaited table leg through the post the other day (it's a long story, features Ikea, and would be better suited to a \"Why I hate\" column). Nevertheless, the table leg was wrapped in a gloriously large sheet of bubble wrap which I have been popping bit by bit, loath to do too much at a time in case I go to it one day and find there are no bubbles left to pop. <p>As has long been recognised, bubble wrap is the ultimate stress-buster. The popper has power over whether the little bubbles live or die, and control over the time taken to make each bubble pop. Each bubble requires a decision on the popping technique used and while the popper loses themselves in the joy of popping, all the worries of the world disappear. </p> <p>Sometimes I prefer to pop bubble wrap one bubble at a time, slowly squeezing the air inside until the plastic can hold no longer - pop. At other times I like to grab the whole sheet, scrunch it into a ball and twist. Pop pop pop pop pop, I could do it all day. And now I've disover virtual bubble wrap I can, safe in the knowledge that if the bubbles run out I can just refresh my computer and a whole new page of bubbles will appear. </p> <p>Several websites offer virtual bubble wrap, which, with computer speakers turned on, give a rather satisfying pop whenever you click on a bubble with your mouse. I like to do it in the office, just popping a single bubble every so often to see whether anyone notices, although when the office is empty I've been known to let rip and get through a whole screen in one go. </p> <p>There are several websites offering virtual bubble wrap. But the best, without doubt, is <a href=\"http://www.virtual-bubblewrap.com\">www.virtual-bubblewrap.com</a>. For, although bubble-wrap popping is essentially a solitary activity, this site lets you share the bubble-wrap love by sending your dear ones a bubble-wrap e-card.</p>",
  "<p>It was innovation as usual at Citigroup yesterday, as the world's biggest bank promoted a woman, Sallie Krawcheck, to the position of chief financial officer. </p> <p>This is in effect the number three slot to Chuck Prince, chief executive, and his number two, Robert Willumstad. The veteran chairman, Sandy Weill, has more or less taken a back seat already, and Krawcheck's appointment was generally being seen as an interesting piece of succession planning. </p> <p>But this looks to be more than a gender talking point. Krawcheck first rose to prominence two years ago, when she was appointed to run the semi-autonomous Smith Barney broking operation, which in turn had been created to address some of the governance and investment banking ethics issues in the wake of Eliot Spitzer's timely raid on Wall Street practices. </p> <p>She was dubbed \"the queen of clean\" at the time and the guessing now has to be that Sandy and Chuck hope Ms Krawcheck will have a cleansing effect on the business worldwide. </p> <p>Which is certainly what Citigroup needs. After paying $400m to settle conflict of interest claims and the like, Weill managed to resist a campaign led by California's crusading pension fund manager, Calpers, to have him held personally accountable for the scandals that hit New York's biggest firms in the wake of Enron and the dotcom bubble. </p> <p>Yet since then Citigroup seems to have lurched from one crisis to the next - the most embarrassing being the recent regulatory clampdown in Japan, where Citigroup was ordered to close its private banking operation, and the charges of bond market manipulation in Europe, which are being investigated by the Financial Services Authority. </p> <p>Unlike some of its rivals, there has never been a sense of cultural decay or financial banditry at Citigroup. But there are clearly deep-seated issues about control: common sense suggests this bank is just too big. </p> <p><strong> Too tight-lipped </strong><br> </p> <p> The words \"closed with-profits fund\" are hardly ones to set the pulse racing. Yet the sums of money locked up in these funds are now equal to about \u00a310,000 for every household in the country - and this financial prison doesn't allow any visitors. </p> <p>With-profits funds were possibly the biggest casualty of the stock market falls after 2000. Sixty-six of the 110 funds have closed to new business, representing assets totalling \u00a3191bn, mostly belonging to small savers. When markets were booming, these funds were only too happy to proclaim their 10-15% annual returns. </p> <p>Today, if the closed funds are asked about performance, charges, asset allocation and surrender values, they are not just tight-lipped but in many cases obstructive. Requests by the press for information are routinely ignored and even the IFAs who sold their endowments and pensions in the first place can't make any headway. </p> <p>Stung by criticism from the Treasury select committee, the FSA today publishes its findings. The executive summary could have read: \"A lot of them are rubbish but some of them aren't too bad, and the press and MPs have been a little too hard on them.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately there's not a lot more to say, because the FSA fell into the industry's trap; astonishingly, the City watchdog says it can't reveal the performance figures on each of the closed funds because they were collected \"privately\". Clearly these figures are so sensitive that the industry won't tell anybody - even their regulator - unless secrecy is assured. The FSA won't even release the names of the closed funds it regulates. </p> <p>To be fair, it is introducing powers to force information disclosure by the closed funds from 2006. But it seems remarkable that those powers are not in place already. </p> <p><strong> Secret agents </strong><br> </p> <p> The Irish buccaneers have got what they wanted at Manchester United - disclosure of agents' fees in full pedantic detail. The question now is what will come of it and the answer, at least in the short term, is probably not much. </p> <p>The response of David Gill, United's chief executive, was not to complain about the high costs of these middle men but to defend their role. </p> <p>He would help his case if he offered an explanation of the lack of logic in agents' rates. The payment to Louis Saha's agent was 6.5% of the transfer fee from Fulham, so why should Alan Smith's man get 12.5%? And why should Ruud van Nistelrooy's agent get \u00a31.2m for negotiating the extension to his player's contract? It's not as if the Dutchman was agitating for a move. </p> <p>Such questions - if posed by John Magnier and JP McManus - might carry some weight in the Old Trafford boardroom and they ought to be asked. United is a big club, but not so big that a million or two shaved off agents' fees wouldn't be felt at the bottom line. </p> <p>United's move may encourage other quoted clubs to adopt the full-disclosure route but don't hold your breath. United's move was a response to a specific demand from two hard-nosed investors with a 29% stake. In the City, the issue of agents' fees does not raise temperatures for the simple reason that fund managers long ago gave up on football clubs as suitable investments.</p>",
  "<p>RMC, the world's biggest supplier of ready-mixed concrete, has agreed a \u00a32.3bn takeover deal from Cemex of Mexico, raising fears of job cuts and quarry closures. </p> <p>The transaction took the City by surprise and boosted shares in the British firm 42% to 850p, only 5p lower than the cash offer price. </p> <p>It also boosted the stock market value of other potential targets in the building materials sector such as Hanson. </p> <p>The Cemex transaction is the biggest launched by a Mexican company and will create a third force in global cement making, behind Lafarge of France and Holcim of Switzerland. </p> <p>Hector Medina, executive vice-president of Cemex, refused to say whether the RMC management would be retained or whether there would be wider cutbacks. \"We can't rule out anything.\" </p> <p>Cemex is aiming for savings of $200m (\u00a3110m) annually by 2007 and a review of the British firm would need to be completed before the future shape and size was decided, he said. </p> <p>No one should expect any \"Mexicanisation\" of the business because his company had a \"very multicultural management team\". </p> <p>Cemex had been following RMC for some time and opened talks with directors two weeks ago. </p> <p>Mr Medina denied Cemex was overpaying but said it was a \"fair\" price for shareholders of RMC and its new owner. Cemex would need to borrow \"just a few dollars\" to fund the $5.8bn enterprise value of the deal. </p> <p>David Munro, RMC's chief executive, said shareholders were being offered the chance to cash in on the strong potential of the business. </p> <p>\"Becoming part of a powerful new group within the global heavy building materials industry will offer great scope and opportunities for our staff.\" </p> <p>Analysts at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein urged RMC shareholders to \"take the cash and run\". </p> <p>RMC, formerly known as Ready Mixed Concrete, was started by a Danish engineer, Kjeld Ammentorp, in 1930 with \u00a36,000 seed capital. </p> <p>It has been through a rough period owing to weakness in the German economy but was seen by the City as on the mend after a substantial restructuring which saw 5,000 jobs go. </p> <p>RMC, which gains 45% of its sales of cement and other building materials in Britain and Germany, follows Blue Circle into the control of a foreign firm. Blue Circle was bought by Lafarge in 2001 for just over \u00a33bn. </p> <p>The acquisition of RMC will increase Cemex's exposure to mainland Europe and raise Cemex's profile in downstream markets. </p> <p>RMC employs 28,000 staff in 22 countries including 6,500 in Britain at 300 concrete plants and 140 quarries. It produces 12m tonnes of cement a year and in 2003 had a turnover of \u00a34.9bn. </p> <p>Cemex, which owns one of Mexico's leading football clubs, employs 25,000 people in 30 countries and produced sales of $7.2bn last year but is more than twice as profitable as RMC. </p> <p>The biggest takeover deal launched by a Mexican firm in Britain before this was a $23m bid 10 years ago for Ionica Group, a privately owned telephone network. </p> <p>The largest previous transaction by a Mexican company anywhere was the $3.6bn takeover of a Coca-Cola bottling business. </p> <p>New York-listed Cemex made waves in the 1990s with a series of domestic takeovers that transformed it into a substantial international business. Four years ago it bought US cement maker Southdown for $2.8bn.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Welcome to another Champions League Tuesday. All the talk this week has been of Wayne Rooney's debut for Manchester United tonight, so if you want to see how Master Potato Head is getting on, you can keep abreast of his performance <a href=\"http://football.theguardian.com/news/matchreport/0,9752,1314725,00.html\">here</a>. Alternatively, if you'd rather gaze slack-jawed at a website devoted to Chewbacca from Star Wars, why not click <a href=\"http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/chewbacca/\">here</a> instead. </p> <p><strong>Pre-match niceties:</strong> The match is preceded by a poorly observed minute's silence for some students who were killed in a traffic accident on their way to the closing ceremony of the Paralympics. The sward itself is cloaked in a pall of smoke which I presume is from fire-crackers in the stand. Liverpool line out in their change kit of yellow and black and play from left to right, while the home side play in red and white striped shirts, white shorts and white socks. </p> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> From about 25 yards out and to the right of the Liverpool goal, Rivaldo shoots a free-kick high and wide. </p> <p> <strong>2 mins:</strong> Milan Baros works hard and does well to win a corner for a Liverpool. Left winger Stephen Warnock, picked ahead of Harry Kewell and having his first experience of Champions League football tonight, swings in the corner. Antonis Nikopolidis punches it clear. </p> <p> <strong>4 mins:</strong> For Olympiakos, Okkas wins the ball at the byline, cuts a couple of yards inside (leaving Sami Hyypia for dead in the process and tries a low, hard drive to the near post. His effort beats Jerzy Dudek, but crashes off the foot of the upright and back into play. </p> <p><strong>7 mins:</strong> \"I don't remember Chewbacca having a simple tool pouch, but then who would?\" inquires Bill Hindle in Washington. You'd be amazed, Bill. I'd imagine most bespectacled geeks who work in IT would probably be able to tell you anything you need to know about our hirsute Wookiee friend. They're as handy as small pots when it comes to things like that. </p> <p> <strong>9 mins:</strong> Steve Finnan concedes a free-kick for waving his arms about in an ungentlemanly fashion about 40 yards out from the Liverpool goal. Grigoris Georgatoslw swings it in and Liverpool head clear. </p> <p><strong>11 mins:</strong> Liveprool win a free-kick on the right corner of the Olympiakos box, which Finnan sends in. Pierluigi Collina, enjoying his valedictory circuit of the Champions League before his retirement next year, orders him to take it again. Probably because he can. Finnan repeats the process, but sends his inswinger straight into the Olympiakos wall, which was standing less half the regulation 10 yards away. </p> <p> <strong>14 mins:</strong> \"Have Arsenal scored yet?\" asks Matthew Whittington. </p> <p> <strong>16 mins: Olympiakos 1 - 0 Liverpool:</strong> Liverpool's penchant for zonal marking at set-pieces - the system that served them so well when they got whipped by Manchester United recently - proves their undoing again. Rivaldo swung a free-kick into the Liverpool box, it took a deflection off Milan Baros and the incoming Ieroklis Stolitidis beat a forlorn Sami Hyypia in the air to nod the ball home past Jerzy Dudek. </p> <p> <strong>20 mins:</strong> \"I just long for a tough, tanned and toned English journalist to grab me by the waist,\" writes my muse, Paula Willow from New York, who could well be choking and in urgent need of somebody to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre. \"Go on Barry - give it a pop. Go on.\" Tempting as your offer is Ms Willow, I'm afraid I'm not tough, tanned, toned or English. Indeed, many would question my journalistic credentials as well. </p> <p><strong>23 mins:</strong> A Steve Finnan cross into the Olympiakos box from the right evades everyone. Stephen Warnock sends in another, which Nikopolidis gathers with ease. Olympiakos counter and Rivaldo rifles a daisy-cutter narrowly wide. In Madrid, Real are losing 2-0 against Roma, while Manchester United are beating Fenerbahce 2 - 0, with a certain brothel-creeping Scouser having notched up his first goal for his new club. </p> <p> <strong>27 mins:</strong> Josemi tries to put Baros through with a long-throw, but the Czech striker fouls his marker and concedes a free-kick. Liverpool certainly aren't having it all their own way tonight and ITV2's co-commentator Jim Beglin has correctly pointed out that referee Pierluigi Collina is being \"a bit of a homer\". </p> <p> <strong>30 mins:</strong> Steve Finnan is taken down on the right corner of the box by a scything tackle from behind, which sees Pantos booked. Free-kick for Liverpool. Finnan and Warnock attempt some fancy rehearsed move from the training ground that goes horribly wrong and end up conceding a throw-in. With brains, some of these lads would be dangerous. </p> <p> <strong>33 mins:</strong> \"It's MISS Willow,\" writes Paula Willow. \"So tell me about yourself. I'm sure that you really a big hunk of beef, and you're just being modest. Eh?\" If only, Paula. If only</p> <p> <strong>35 mins:</strong> Liverpool are lucky not to go two down, when Giovanni gets on the end of a cross from the left and sends his header <em>this</em> wide of Jerzy Dudek's upright. Elsewhere in Europe, Wayne Rooney has scored his second and Manchester United's third. </p> <p> <strong>38 mins:</strong> This match is sluggish in the extreme at the moment, so if anyone needs a diversion, Brian Marples has very kindly sent in this guide to agricultural <a href=\"http://muextension.missouri.edu/explore/agguides/agengin/g01965.htm\">hand signals</a>. Twice. It wasn't even that funny the first time, Brian. </p> <p> <strong>40 mins:</strong> Stephen Warnock sees yellow for a late tackle on Dimitris Mavrogenidis. Rivaldo sends the free-kick into the Liverpool box and Dudek concedes a corner, from which yet another Olympiakos player gets a free header. Liverpool's marking at set-pieces is like a good analogy in a Guardian Unlimited minute-by-minute match report: Non-existent. </p> <p> <strong>43 mins:</strong> Come on. Move along, there's nothing to see here. </p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong></p> <p><strong>Shrewd observation:</strong> \"It's funny that the Guardian would call it the minute-by-minute report when they can clearly see you report about every three or four minutes. Hope this means you won't get the sack!\" writes Andy Myers. I see what you've done there Andy. Very funny. Because you see it's <em>called</em> a minute-by-minute report, but it's not <em>actually</em> updated on a minutely basis. I am absolutely <em>amazed</em> that not one single person has ever cottoned on to this before and sent in a similar mail pointing out the obvious flaw. Because you'd think with such flagrant abuse of the Trade Descriptions Act going on every night there's Champions League football on the box, other saddos might have noticed too. And. Then. Whinged. About. It. Incessantly. </p> <p><strong>Opportunistic lust masquerading as friendly help:</strong> \"I'm going to the Chelsea Piers complex in New York to play five-a-side on Friday evening,\" writes Steve Gaw. \"If you can persuade Paula Willow to come along I can verify for you that she's not a New Jersey teamster.\" Nice try Steve, but don't think I'm not wise to your sordid little caper.</p> <p><strong>45 mins:</strong> Liverpool replace Stephen Warnock with Harry Kewell, who has been playing with all the guile of a blind goat since he married Sheree Murphy, who used to work behind the bar in the Wool Pack on Emmerdale. </p> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> An attempted cross from the right by Yiannis Okkas goes out for a corner off John Arne Riise. It's cleared and Olympiakos No21 Grigoris Georgatoslw sends a spectacular volley from outside the box high and wide. </p> <p>\"Do you think you could let Paula know that Ms does stand for Miss, and that her pointing it out like that makes it look like she's desperate. No offense though. I'm sure she's not really,\" writes Julien Raze. </p> <p> <strong>49 mins:</strong> \"Perhaps we should let Miss Willow have her fantasies,\" writes Rando Wilson who, as you've probably gathered from the name, is an American, from Columbus in Ohio. \"My fantasy would be for Liverpool to put two good games together in a row this season. Doesn't look too promising for me. As for Miss Willow...\"</p> <p>No offence Rando, but if I had a name like yours, my fantasy would be to see my parents sentenced to life without parole breaking rocks for what can only be described as blatant child abuse. I suppose you should be grateful for small mercies - at least it's not Randy.</p> <p> <strong>52 mins:</strong> An excellent challenge from Pantos prevents Steve Finnan from crossing from the right wing. Corner for Liverpool. It's sent in by Kewell, but Sami Hyypia is penalised for trying to mount Nikopolidis in the Olympiakos goal. That's been Liverpool's first attack of note in the second half, but describing it as noteworthy lends it a gravitas it scarcely deserves. </p> <p> <strong>54 mins:</strong> John Arne Riise rifles a free-kick over the Olympiakos bar from just outside the penalty area. Meanwhile in Old Trafford, Wayne Rooney has just completed his hat-trick. That'll probably get a couple of column inches in tomorrow's papers. </p> <p><strong>56 mins:</strong> \"Defend me, Barry!\" implores Paula Willow, in what I'm sure is a husky voice. \"Ms. is not the same as Miss. It is used when a lady does not want to reveal whether she is a 'Miss' or a 'Mrs'. I suggest that Julien crawl back into his French fox-hole and learn some English. I am a 'Miss' and proud of it!\" </p> <p>Don't worry Paula, as that top MOR combo Chicago famously sang: <em>\"I am a man who will fight for your honour. I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of. Gonna live forever, knowing together that we did it all for the glory of love.\"</em></p> <p> <strong>60 mins:</strong> Mavrogenidis gets booked for a foul on Milan Baros on the left hand side of the Olympiakos box. Liverpool's big men trundle up the field for the ensuing free-kick, but Steve Finnan's delivery is absolutely dreadful. How much does he get paid? </p> <p> <strong>63 mins:</strong> Olympiakos have decided to try and hold what they have and are sitting back letting Liverpool attack. From the edge of the box, Milan Baros plays the ball into space for the unmarked Harry Kewell to rifle home. The Australian misses as easy a chance as he will ever get, but his blushes are spared when he's penalised for offside. Elsewhere in Europe: Manchester United 5 - 2 Fenerbahce, Real Madrid 2 - 2 AS Roma. </p> <p> <strong>67 mins:</strong> Pantos skins Josemi and attempts to nip in around the back of the Liverpool defence. Sadly for him, the ball Heskeys off his shin and bobbles out of play. </p> <p>Richard Bartley has been busy. \"If you key Paula Willow into Google's picture search the first picture is a dog,\" he says. Meanwhile, Patrick Falvey wants everyone to look at <a href=\"  http://www.irishvibe.com/article121.html\">this</a>. Who am I to rain on his parade? I haven't had time to check it yet, though, so I sincerely hope it isn't leprachaun porn. </p> <p> <strong>70 mins:</strong> Olympiakos substitution: Georgiadis and Venetidis for Mavrogenidis and Giovanni. Newcastle fans may remember Mr Georgiadis, who was brought to St James Park by Kenny Dalglish and sent packing by Ruud Gullit. </p> <p> <strong>73 mins:</strong> Liverpool substitution: Djbril Cisse for Josemi. Georgiadis tries to ping a low cross into the six-yard box for Rivaldo, but John Arne Riise cuts it out with a crucial interception. From the ensuing corner, Olympiakos go close again. Liverpool's zonal marking at set-pieces is farcical - it's eerily reminsicent of Wimbledon's comedy defending under Wellington-wearing Norwegian Egil Olsen. The players haven't a notion what they're supposed to be doing when the ball comes into their box </p> <p> <strong>78 mins:</strong> Real Madrid are now 3-2 up on Roma. And I'm stuck watching this rubbish. The beatings will continue until morale improves. </p> <p> <strong>79 mins:</strong> More slack marking in the Liverpool box affords Rivaldo the opportunity to try and bicycle kick a cross into the Liverpool goal. He didn't make contact, but as misses go it was fairly spectacular. Not as spectacular as Ms. Paula Willow though, I'll wager. </p> <p> <strong>82 mins:</strong> Pantos gets his second yellow card, followed closely by the obligatory red for a needless foul in the centre-circle. He walks off without complaint. Meanwhile in Old Trafford: Manchester United 6 - 2 Fenerbahce. Bah!!! Rob Smyth gets eight goals and I get some more substitutions: For Liverpool - Didi Hamann off, Salif Diao on. For Olympiakos: Georgatos off, Vallas on. </p> <p><strong>85 mins:</strong> Another Steve Finnan cross into the box fails to find anybody in a yellow shirt and the ball skims off the head of an Olympiakos defender and out for a throw-in. The Greek side counter and Georgiadis goes close with a low shot past Dudek that goes wide of the left post. </p> <p>Paula Willow is back: \"Oh come on Barry,\" she says. \"Enough, with the pithy comments and dry 'wit'. Tell me about YOU. What do you look like? What do you feel? What do you think about you and me.\" What do I think about you and me? Em, I think it might be time to call the police and possibly get a restraining order. </p> <p> <strong>88 mins:</strong> Gabriel Schrrer gets booked for a late challenge on Harry Kewell, who promptly gets involved in some argy bargy with Pantelis Kafis, which Pierluigi Collina soon sorts out. There will be three minutes of added time. </p> <p> <strong>90+1 mins:</strong> \"Of course if <em>you</em> were doing the Man Utd commentary it would still read 4 - 2 and I would have an ounce of hope left!\" writes Mike Davis. Funny man. There's a photographer from my home town of Birr, County Offaly in the Republic of Ireland named Mike Davis, although I suspect you're not him. </p> <p> <strong>90+2 mins:</strong> A rash challenge by Steve Finnan on Stoltidis in the centre-circle earns the Liverpool player a yellow card. The goalscorer limps off, leaving his side with only nine men. Liverpool frantically try to score, but Salif Diao shoots a half-chance high and wide. </p> <p> <strong>90+3 mins:</strong> Peep! Peep! Peep! Pierluigi Collina brings proceedings to a close and Liverpool lose a match in which they must surely have fancied their chances. Elsewhere in Europe, Manchester United have beaten Fenerbahce 6-2, while Real Madrid beat Roma 4-2. Right, that's me done for tonight so thanks for your time and your emails. I didn't get to read them all, which means the evening wasn't a complete waste of time.</p> <p> <strong>Olympiakos:</strong> 71-Antonis Nikopolidis; 14-Dimitris Mavrogenidis, 32-Giorgos Anatolakis, 12-Gabriel Sch|rrer, 30-Anastasios Pantos; 5-Rivaldo, 6-Ieroklis Stoltidis,1-Pantelis Kafes, 21-Grigoris Georgatos; 10-Giovanni, 9-Yiannis Okkas .<br><strong> Subs:</strong> Giannou, Venetidis, Castillo, Maric, Kostoulas, Vallas, Georgiadis.</p> <p> <strong>Liverpool:</strong> 1-Jerzy Dudek; 17-Josemi, 23-Jamie Carragher, 4-Sami Hyypia, 6-John Arne Riise; 3-Steve Finnan, 14-Xabi Alonso, 16-Dietmar Hamann, 28-Stephen Warnock; 10-Louis Garcia, 5-Milan Baros <br><strong> Subs:</strong> Kirkland, Kewell, Cisse, Diao, Traore, Sinama Pongolle, Biscan.</p> <p> <strong>Referee:</strong> Pierluigi Collina (Italy)</p>",
  "<p><strong>Premature preamble</strong> Evening. This is all very exciting, isn't it, eh? Oh. Fenerbahce have only ever won one European Cup away from home - at Old Trafford, on a thoroughly miserable evening in 1996. Exciting stat, eh? Oh.</p> <p><strong>Team news: he starts!!</strong> Rooney starts, but behind him is possibly the worst midfield since seen at Old Trafford since Ralph Milne's paunch was wobbling around the Theatre of Dreams. Tinkerbell is back. The full team is: Carroll; G Neville, Ferdinand, Silvestre, Heinze; Bellion, Kleberson, Djemba-Djemba, Giggs; Rooney, Van Nistelrooy.</p> <p><strong>Inane chit-chat</strong> \"What the hell is that picture?\" asks Richard Bartley. \"She looks like she is dead.\" In the words of David Brent, she's not dead. It's from Blow-Up, a 60s film I was taken to see last night. Interesting experience: visually absolutely lush, but I found it risibly indulgent.</p> <p><strong>Random observations</strong> This is the modern-day United side, taken to the extreme: a very solid defence (the best back four playing together for the first time), dream forward line ... and what the hell do you call that filth in the middle? It's a huge problem even when everyone is fit, even more so when Tinkerbell rests his best two midfielders.</p> <p><strong>Steve McMahon's pate</strong> It's shining majestically on Sky Sports News, for those of you who care.</p> <p><strong>Full teams</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Manchester United:</strong> Carroll, Gary Neville, Heinze, Ferdinand, Silvestre, Bellion, Djemba-Djemba, Kleberson, Giggs, van Nistelrooy, Rooney. Subs: Ricardo, Phil Neville, Ronaldo, Smith, Miller, O'Shea, Fletcher.</p> <p><strong>Fenerbahce:</strong> Rustu, Baris, Luciano, Ozat, Akyel, Balci, Aurelio, Marcio Nobre, Sanli, Alex, Van Hooijdonk. Subs: Demirel, Rodriguez, Yozgatli, Hacioglu, Akin, Turaci, Sahin. </p> <p>Referee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium)</p> <p><strong>A reader writes</strong> \"Has selecting your best team gone out of fashion?\" says Colman Walsh. \"If Djemba-Djemba lined out for Cork City I'd be upset...but playing for United? Frustrating, baffling, depressing....and it's not as if they are cruising in the Champions League or anything...Pah! i'm fed up with it all.\" Sack Djembax2. Where's my Ronnie?</p> <p><strong>Gags etc</strong> \"If Rooney runs riot on his debut, what better headline than : 'EX-TOFFEE'S TURKISH DELIGHT'!\" screams Ian Kaweley. Oh dear. Given that, having seen that dog's dinner of a midfield, I'm about as enthused about this game as I would be about 12 hours stuck in a lift with Graham Norton and a tub of vaseline, this is setting a worrying precedent for the night.</p> <p><strong>Here we go then</strong> It's almost ironic: the future of Manchester United rests on a fat Scouser (and a pretty-boy Portugese). And yes, I am extremely disappointed my hero isn't playing, BUT he does need a rest and it's probably not a bad time to do it, with him on the bench ready to produce fireworks if necessary. But Bellion?</p> <p><strong>Rooneywatch</strong> He looks pretty nerveless, chewing gum lazily and strutting around. </p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Like the chicken I forgot to shove in the freezer this morning, they're off. United, in red, are kicking left to right; Fenerbahce have lovely wasp-coloured tops.</p> <p><strong>2 min</strong> Good first touch for Rooney, who skipped past one man 25 yards out before being crowded out. The pitch, like Rooney himself, looks a bit heavy early on. Rooney then plays a delicious, cushioned first-time pass into Bellion's path; Bellion's pull-back was eventually cleared.</p> <p><strong>4 min</strong> I don't know if it's been raining heavily in Manchester, but the pitch really does look slow, borderline sloshy even. United have had all the possession so far; Van Nistelrooy skips past one on the edge of the box and - check out <a href=\"http://football.theguardian.com/theknowledge/story/0,13854,1314846,00.html\">The Knowledge</a> - chokes one at the keeper from just outside the area.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 1 Fenerbahce 0</strong> Ryan Giggs scores a splendid goal. Kleberson picked the pocket in midfield, fed Giggs, he played it again to Kleberson on the left, who skipped past his man and planted a lovely left-footed cross right on Giggs's head 12 yards out; he did the rest with a fine glancing header that zipped off the turf and into the corner.</p> <p><strong>8 min</strong> That's the thing with Kleberson: nobody doubts his technical ability - that was a beautiful cross - just whether, like Juan Veron, he can impose himself on Premiership games.</p> <p><strong>11 min</strong> Free-kick wide on the left to Fenerbahce is teased in superbly by the Harvard-educated left foot of Alex, Brazil's Copa America-winning captain. Heinze eventually bundles it away.</p> <p><strong>13 min</strong> Wayne Rooney nearly scores and sends Clive Tyldesley into ecstacy. Put through after some poor defending, he went too wide, but then pulled it back past Rustu very cleverly before whipping a left-footed over the top from a nice angle. Just before, United fans were still singing anti-Scouse songs. Nice greeting.</p> <p><strong>15 min</strong> Paul Rawes points out that the last time Ryan Giggs opened the scoring with his head in Man United's first home game of a Champions League campaign, they went and won the whole thing. Yikes: they even had a David B playing right-midfield as well. It must be fate.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 2 Fenerbahce 0</strong> A majestic finish from Wayne Rooney. A real role-reversal from United's new strike partnership: Van Nistelrooy, dropping deep, picked a beautiful sliderule pass for Rooney, marching through, to smack an emphatic shot into the roof of the net as Rustu came out. That was beautifully taken.</p> <p><strong>24 min</strong> \"I thought it was interesting that two midfield players contrived to score the goal, part of 'possibly the worst midfield seen at Old Trafford since Ralph Milne's paunch was wobbling around the Theatre of Dreams',\" says Jeremy Solomon. \"I think the reason I follow your live coverage is for exactly that kind of incisive knowledge.\" Fair cop, but the way Fenerbahce are playing, Ryan Adams and David Bellamy could rip them apart.</p> <p><strong>25 min</strong> Hahahahahaha. Real Madrid are 2-0 down to Roma. Laugh? I almost</p> <p><strong>27 min</strong> Disallowed goal for Fenerbahce. Bending corner from Alex went out before it came back in, so Marcio Nobre's thumping header didn't count. Better out than in, you say? Not this time, apparently.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 3 Fenerbache 0</strong> A tremendous goal from Wayne Rooney, and the hairs on the back of my neck are going ballistic. That was sensational: Giggs slipped a square-pass 30 yards out, he dummied the defender with a shuffle of the hips, and then rammed it low into the far corner from 25 yards. What a debut.</p> <p><strong>30 min</strong> Bit of needle involving Van Nistelrooy and Luciano ends with a sly trip from Van Nistelrooy and, erm, Aurelio getting booked.</p> <p><strong>33 min</strong> Wonder what Alan Smith and Louis Saha make of all this. They must know now that they have as much chance of playing in the really big games as Duncan Goodhew has of becoming the new Nicky Clarke.</p> <p><strong>35 min</strong> All quiet. \"Ian Kaweley might be right,\" says Peter Miller. \"His reward: A Milky bar and crackerjack pencil.\" And a stalker.</p> <p><strong>37 min</strong> \"What's the Man U record for total goals from one player on his debut?\" asks Paolo Pasquini. Good question: Van Nistelrooy got two on his debut, if you don't count the Community Shield, but I don't know of any hat-tricks. Andy Ritchie?</p> <p><strong>40 min</strong> I'd like to say something exciting has happened, and I'd like to say I'm close friends with Cheryl Tweedy.</p> <p><strong>41 min</strong> United are happy to let Fenerbahce have plenty off the ball at the moment, but as yet they've only really threatened by the sweetly pinged free-kicks from the left foot of Alex.</p> <p><strong>43 min</strong> \"Yes - Andy Ritchie got a debut hat-trick at OT in 1979,\" says John Whitney. \"I woz there. When the third went in I punched my wife by mistake. She's now my ex-wife.\"</p> <p><strong>45 min</strong> Nearly a hat-trick for Rooney: slick interplay before Gary Neville skims a low cross in, and Rooney bashes a shot wide, possibly via a defender. <strong>Half time</strong> As expected, it was all about Wayne Rooney - but surely nobody expected to score twice, especially goals of such an emphatic nature. It's all gone according to plan for United, and they should win this four or five if they can be bothered in the second half.</p> <p><strong>Half time small talk</strong> \"Am I the only one that thinks of Gladiator every time the commentator says Marco Aurelio?\" says Jason Andreas. Erm, apparently.</p> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Like two cats who've been ignoring each other but are now scratching one another and miiouwwwwwing like there's no tomorrow, they're playing again.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 3 Fenerbahce 1</strong> Marcio Nobre gives Fenerbahce a sniff. Whipped corner from Alex - it was always going to be a set piece - is not clearled properly, and Marcio (who, and he's a defender, has now scored five in five games) thrashes it into the net from 12 yards. Excellent finish.</p> <p><strong>49 min</strong> Skimming, swooshing half-volley from range by the inevitable Rooney is parried awkwardly by Rustu. </p> <p><strong>51 min</strong> End-to-end stuff at the moment, and the Turks have already offered more in this half than they did in all of the first. Another one would make this game interesting, as would a 24-man Royal Rumble.</p> <p><strong>53 min</strong> Free-kick to United, right on the edge of the box. Here's Kevin Mitchell: \"Surely Duncan Goodhew's slaphead doesn't disqualify him from becoming a crimper to the stars; after all the multi-award-winning Trevor Sorbie from Richard and Judy is no Barry Venison.\" Agreed, agreed, but it's a bit like Ian Beale becoming a fashion guru.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 4 Fenerbahce 1</strong> Unbelievable: Wayne Rooney seals the first hat-trick of his professional life with a brilliant, curling free-kick. A simply extraordinary start to his Old Trafford career.</p> <p><strong>55 min</strong> The best thing was that he never looked like not scoring there. The minute the foul was given he claimed it, took his time and then clipped it lazily into the far corner. </p> <p><strong>56 min</strong> Van Hooijdonk, 94, spanks a long-range drive not far wide.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 4 Fenerbahce 2</strong> After Rooney needlessly concedes a corner, Tuncay larrups home from the edge of the box after apart 14 ricochets. Pretty poor defending from United again.</p> <p><strong>61 min</strong> Serhat Akin, a forward, on for Fatih, a full-back. \"Rooney's first hat-trick,\" muses a chin-stroking Ryan Barnes. \"I heard his first hat-trick was at a certain Liverpool institution of disrepute.\" <em>That's</em> more like it.</p> <p><strong>64 min</strong> Fletcher on for Giggs, with Bellion switching to left midfield.</p> <p><strong>66 min</strong> Fenerbahce are all over United like a cheap coat with an in-built rash at the moment; the home side's defending from set pieces has been dreadful. \"Hahaha,\" laughs Monica Fernandes. \"Real Madrid 2 x 2 Roma. And just wait!\"</p> <p><strong>67 min</strong> Superb defending from Ferdinand, as the substitute Serhat tried to spin like John Travolta in the area. </p> <p><strong>70 min</strong> Rooney, played in by Kleberson, should have done better, but his control lets him down. \"Sorry to trouble you,\" interjects Howard Davies, rudely. \"'Tinkerbell': Isn't she Peter Pan's girl? Who are you trying to describe exactly?\" Sir Alex Ferguson, of course, who was given said nickname for his penchant for, erm, tinkering with his boys, as it were. He changes the team a lot.</p> <p><strong>73 min</strong> It's all gone a bit quiet. Not quite sure why Giggs was taken off; if Kleberson went left and Fletcher in the centre, I could just about understand it. But the current balance, like Eldorado, is just wrong.</p> <p><strong>75 min</strong> Alex stings Carroll's palms from the edge of the box. Good hit, good save, and United's midfield are being overrun completely now. \"I think Monica Fernandez being satisfied with a draw at home with Roma shows how desperate they've become,\" says Victor Lloret. \"And when will you Brits start admitting that Beckham is rubbish?\" Oh-ho, don't get me started, Victor: I've been saying this for years. The moment he became an England, rather than Man United player, he was on the slippery slope.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 5 Fenerbahce 2</strong> Game over, thanks to Ruud Van Nistelrooy. Superb, driven, Beckhamesque pass from Fletcher on the right, Van Nistelrooy chests it down, eases it away from the defender, and whacks it into the top corner.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 6 Fenerbahce 2</strong> David Bellion comes to the party. Long ball from Silvestre, flick from Rooney and Bellion - who was borderline offside - coolly nutmegged Rustu. That's four in seven games for him now.</p> <p><strong>81 min</strong> Phil Neville and Miller on for Heinze and Van Nistelrooy.</p> <p><strong>86 min</strong> Umit Ozat cracks the post with a shinned, attempted side-foot volley from the left of the box. It's hard to gripe when you score six, but United have defended poorly. If this'd been Arsenal it would 6-6.</p> <p><strong>90 min</strong> Like Chris Finch, this game is nearly done.</p> <p><strong>Full time: Manchester United 6 Fenerbahce 2</strong> That's it - a pretty remarkable game, all told, but everything pales into insignficance against Wayne Rooney's glorious debut hat-trick. We all knew he was good, but this was absolutely frightening. Thanks for all your emails, Rob.</p>",

  "<p>It's been sci-fi and soccer the last few days. And no, sadly that doesn't mean <a href=\"http://www.bitmap-brothers.co.uk/our-games/past/speedball2.htm\">Speedball</a>. Most of my time was spent on Star Wars Trilogy: Apprentice of the Force for Game Boy Advance, my Online review this week. After watching the DVDs I was in the mood for all things Star Wars, even a generic 2D platform game. Elsewhere I revisited the weightier adventuring of <a href=\"http://www.planetdeusex.com/\">Deus Ex: Invisible War</a> and had the lads round for some Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Deus Ex, in particular, was a treat. Much maligned on release earlier this year for being a dumbed-down sequel, Invisible War's atmosphere and tightly focussed environments were a pleasure to return to. Yes, excessive signposting takes away some of the freedom, but is that a bad thing? I loved the original Deus Ex, but it was certainly bloated in places. It's a shame that <a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId=127/\">Warren Spector</a>, head of developers ION Storm, has left the company. Deus Ex: Directors Cut \u2013 taking the graphics and focus of Invisible War \u2013 would do very nicely. Away from the sci-fi there was Pro Evolution Soccer\u2026</p> <p>Four player, two versus two, Pro Evolution Soccer 4 on the PlayStation 2. Some day all Saturday nights will be like this. Even yet another <a href=\"http://football.theguardian.com/Match_Report/0,1527,1313479,00.html\">defeat for the Saints</a> couldn't dampen the atmosphere. While only preview code, it's clear that Pro Evo 4 is shaping up to be a winner. The pace is faster than before, but the control and feel of the players is tighter than ever. It is still delightful to flick a header into the path of a striker or play triangles on the wing. My concern over new player tricks \u2013 a step too far into FIFA territory \u2013 seems to be misplaced. Yes the top players can pull off some silky trickery but it is hard to do and rare to see \u2013 much like real life. The only real issues at this stage are a hint of slowdown when the penalty area gets crowded, although Konami assure me it will be sorted before release. Even free kicks and the menu interface \u2013 the main gripes of previous games in the series \u2013 have been semi-fixed.</p> <p>Finally my review game \u2013 Star Wars: Apprentice of the Force on Game Boy Advance. I won't spoil your undoubted anticipation for the review, but don't expect, as I optimistically did, a game as good as the <a href=\"http://www.armchairempire.com/classic_gaming/super_star_wars.htm\">Super Star Wars trilogy</a> on the SNES. These games would be fantastic on GBA \u2013 or is it just rose-tinted spectacles? Where they as good as I remember?</p>",
  "<p>Merino sheep are much heavier than they look. I only know this because I got up close and personal with one a few months ago. There were a lot of grunts and shoves but no telephone numbers were exchanged. </p> <p>It took all my strength to haul the dung-covered animal from the back of an old Land Rover up a flight of wooden steps and into a shed. It was especially tough because it was dark and my only source of light was the car headlights. </p> <p>This was not a stag party dare but sheep shearing time at an outback station in New South Wales - and far more fun than any blokey weekend I've been on. </p> <p>Shearing was one of my newly acquired skills at a five-day jackaroo school, where you learn about rural life and how to be a cowboy. It's an antipodean experience as far removed from beach and surf culture as you can imagine. Best of all, no one called you \"dude\" and there was not a celebrity in sight. </p> <p>It is not for half-hearted city slickers who want a quick snapshot of cowboy chic: this is fun but also gruelling, and you are going to get covered in dirt. No matter how many showers I had, I never removed the thin layer of dust that got everywhere. Jackaroos and jillaroos are Australia's equivalents to the cowboys and cowgirls of America's Wild West, and these schools are increasingly popular after Prince Harry trained to be a farm hand in Queensland last year as part of his gap year. </p> <p>I joined 25 young travellers much further south, at Australia's largest and longest running school for budding cowboys and girls in Leconfield, a 7,000-acre cattle ranch near Tamworth, Australia's country music capital, in New South Wales. The farm is located at the end of a 10-mile dirt track and is about as rural and isolated as you can get - a long way from all those sleek, glittery bars back in Sydney. </p> <p>My fellow trainees were mostly backpackers, Aussie, British, Dutch and German, and all, like me, city dwellers hellbent me on a week's crash course in rural matters - though one lady's ambition was to become a vet. The school can't promise to transform you into jackaroo overnight, but it does teach you the fundamentals of farm life. </p> <p>At the end of the week, you will feel rugged and invigorated, and it's likely you'll walk differently - though mostly because you are saddle-sore and exhausted. If you're used to luxury and sunning yourself by a pool or crave all-night drinking games in backpackers' hostels, this probably is not the break for you: there are washroom duties, washing-up rotas and accommodation is on the budget side of basic, on bunk beds in a corrugated iron shack. However, this rustic living just adds to the fun. If you can handle all that, you'll have a better time than the contestants on the new reality TV series The Farm, where celebrities swap the city for life on a working farm. </p> <p>My jackaroo school was a bit like a celebrity free version of that - Big Brother without the misguided egos. We were just average Joes and Joannas without any desire to be famous, just to learn a bit about the bush. </p> <p>It was early to bed and even earlier to rise. We were woken each morning at 6am with loud rock music - a similar tactic to the one used US Marines used to depose the Panamanian dictator General Noriega. </p> <p>We were immediately thrown in at the deep end of the realities of life on a cattle station, from mustering and shearing sheep to horseshoeing, whip-cracking, lassoing and mending fences; oh, yes, and improving pasture, which involves dousing huge swaths of deadly blackberry bushes with gasoline and letting go with a match - a pyromaniacs dream. </p> <p>While the jackaroo course is a practical introduction to country life, it is not all hard graft: we worked from 7.30am until 6.00pm but there was plenty of time to play up to the cowboy image. It was great to act the part in those leather chaps and Akubra hats. </p> <p>While mustering sheep on horseback, we traversed steep-sided hills and winding creeks to round them into a herd. I didn't really pull my weight on this because I was frequently distracted by the stunning surrounding vistas, with kangaroos bouncing across distant hillsides. The blazing winter sunshine was fierce and bleached a lot of the sprawling cattle station. </p> <p>We were taught natural horsemanship by our mentor, Tim Skerrett, whose family has owned Leconfield ranch since 1914. The school started in 1983 with the idea of training young Australians, but the majority of students nowadays are backpackers wanting an authentic experience of the Australian bush. Apparently I needed to learn to dominate my horse. \"Take charge - let them know who's boss,\" Tim said. \"The sneakier you are around horses, the more spooked they get.\" </p> <p>Until this moment my knowledge of equine matters had been limited to an annual flutter on the Grand National. But when it came to whip-cracking I finally found something I had a natural flair for. </p> <p>Outdoors all day, we certainly earned our dinner. We devoured huge meals cooked al fresco over a campfire. We were bushed, but not too tired to enjoy amazing sunsets.</p> <p>Afterwards, we remained huddled around the campfire, swapping stories from our respective countries and debating everything from the Iraq war to whether Vegemite was better than Marmite. I waited for a re-enactment of the flatulence scene from Blazing Saddles but it never came. The alternative was far better: above us were the clearest skies I had ever seen, a light show of shooting stars and satellites and a silence I had only dreamed of at home. </p> <p>A mixture of hard work and good fun, the jackaroo school does not shy away from the hard realities of farm life. For many students the most challenging part of the course was when we were invited to watch a sheep being slaughtered. This was optional and only a handful stayed to watch. I peeked through a gap in my fingers. </p> <p>Our teachers looked like Australia's Marlboro men, straight out of central casting: they looked like cowboys, spoke like cowboys; and even walked like cowboys. They were no-nonsense, grounded folk whose word was their bond. Rugged men such as Tim Skerrett and Steve Bokady had cowboys' names, big hands and firm handshakes, and looked like they had spent every day since they were infants doing manly activities outdoors. They were a great set of chaps, and good teachers.</p> <p>And their lifestyle was infectious. The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to adopt the outback life. But just when I was getting on first-name terms with my favourite mount, it was time to leave. </p> <p>You vow to live off the land when you get home, though in your heart you know you won't get any further than repeats of The Good Life. But that's not the point, as the best travel is about creating hopes and dreams - even if they only last for a week. </p> <p>Back in south London I soon returned to the melee at Sainsbury's, but all is not lost: I'm definitely getting one of those great big bush hats. The boots and the whip can wait a while. </p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.qantas.co.uk\" \"> Qantas</a> (08457 747 767 or www.qantas.co.uk) flies daily from London to Sydney from \u00a3795 (inc tax).

  "<p>Scottish Radio Holdings is not opposed to a takeover bid from another radio group such as Emap, saying it will do whatever is \"in the best interests of shareholders and staff\".</p> <p>SRH chief executive Andrew Findlay told MediaGuardian.co.uk that there were \"no egos\" at his company, suggesting it will not hold back from a deal out of vanity. However, he insisted the company is well placed to go forward on its own.</p> <p>The radio industry and the City have been awash with speculation that Emap could make a move for SRH, of which it already owns 28%.</p> <p>\"There are no egos at SRH. We've always said we would take the interests of shareholders and staff into account because they make the business what it is,\" said Mr Findlay, who will retire at the end of this week.</p> <p>\"It is against that background that we will measure any approach,\" he added. Although Mr Findlay refused to reveal if there had been any approaches, he said he was not currently \"studying any [takeover] papers\".</p> <p>However, he said SRH - which owns 22 radio stations, part of the Score Digital radio multiplex and 45 local newspapers - could go forward on its own.</p> <p>\"At the end of the day the company has got a great future, there is lots of opportunity for growth and we're perfectly happy on our own for the benefit of our shareholders.</p> <p>\"The return SRH shareholders have received over the past 10 years has been the best in the industry. We'll do whatever we believe is in their best interests,\" he added.</p> <p>Mr Findlay voiced one major concern about the wider radio industry - the lack of diversity in new radio stations. He said Ofcom must do a better job than the Radio Authority had in ensuring a wider mix of formats were granted licences.</p> <p>\"Since the beginning of 2001 the Radio Authority issued 30 new licences and if you look at radio's total share of listening, it has gone down. </p> <p>\"The reason is absolutely clear - we're not licensing sufficiently diverse formats. Radio stations are cannibalising their own listeners. If the industry wants to increase revenue and reach the revenue targets it wants, we have to issue new formats,\" said Mr Findlay.</p> <p>He was optimistic that the 30 new stations Ofcom is currently licensing will reach wider audiences, saying the new regulator had a more \"sensible\" approach than that of its predecessor.</p> <p>\"The Radio Authority did not issue licences to the big groups but to a hotch-potch of individuals, who sold them on and made millions, or to individuals with good faith but no experience. I hope Ofcom will look at the health of the industry,\" he added.</p> <p>SRH is among the dozen companies to have applied to run a new station in Edinburgh. Ofcom will announce the successful bid in three months.</p> <p>Earlier today SRH released a healthy set of expected year-end figures, with estimated group revenues 15% ahead of last year. Like-for-like group revenues, excluding acquisitions, are estimated to be up 9%, with radio and press showing a 9% gain.</p>",
  "So here we are facing the possibility unique in our 100 year history, of governing Britain for a third successive term. <p> </p> <p>Never done it before. Never debated it before. Never imagined it before. </p> <p> </p> <p>Progressive parties, like the Labour Party, rarely fail because of their values.</p> <p> </p> <p>Fairness, justice, solidarity, opportunity for all.</p> <p> </p> <p>These are the impulses of any decent human spirit.</p> <p> </p> <p>No. We almost always fail when we don't foresee the future in which those values must be applied.</p> <p> </p> <p>The values require steadfast conviction.</p> <p> </p> <p>But the future requires restless courage to know and act upon the coming reality however hard the challenge it holds.</p> <p> </p> <p>And when the two, conviction and courage combine their strength and take on the challenges, they beat them and in time what was a challenge, becomes part of the new consensus. </p> <p> </p> <p>Reflect on the things once the passionate subject of controversy, people no longer talk about.</p> <p> </p> <p>Remember the march for jobs.</p> <p>No-one talks of mass unemployment now. When two weeks ago it fell to its lowest level for 30 years, it passed without notice.</p> <p> </p> <p>Who did it? The British people, by voting for change.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are people who a decade ago could tell you of interest rates double what they are today, of homes repossessed, of families who didn't know from one week to the next where the mortgage payments were going to come from.</p> <p> </p> <p>But who talks of boom and bust economics today? </p> <p> </p> <p>Who did it? The British people by voting for change.</p> <p> </p> <p>And when was the last time you heard of a winter crisis in the health service or the scandal of outside toilets in primary schools, now that this country, Britain, is the only one anywhere in the developed world increasing public spending on health and education every year, year on year, as a proportion of our national income?</p> <p> </p> <p>And who did it? The British people by voting for change.</p> <p> </p> <p>When did you last hear of pensioners freezing to death in the cold because they couldn't afford the heating?</p> <p> </p> <p>Or how great a debate is there today about the break-up of the United Kingdom, now that Scotland has its Parliament and Wales its Assembly? But twelve years ago an election was fought on it.</p> <p> </p> <p>A week ago, after the talks at Leeds Castle on Northern Ireland, an eighteen year old asked me: \"how come we never hear much about Northern Ireland\"?</p> <p> </p> <p>But we used to wake up every morning to it, didn't we?</p> <p> </p> <p>And remember when to be in favour of gay rights was to be a loony leftie, race relations was political correctness, and Red Ken frightened people even as brave as your own leadership?</p> <p> </p> <p>Now the parties compete for the gay vote, unite against the BNP and Ken has led and won the debate on congestion charging and community policing.</p> <p> </p> <p>So many things that used to divide our country bitterly, now unite it in healthy consensus.</p> <p> </p> <p>Who did it? The British people, by voting for change.</p> <p> </p> <p>Or when the next election comes, will they say Labour can't run the economy; there'll be a run on the markets; that Labour can't defend Britain or won't support the police?</p> <p> </p> <p>No.</p> <p> </p> <p>Labour is working.</p> <p> </p> <p>Britain is working.</p> <p> </p> <p>The longest period of economic growth since records began, an economy now bigger than that of Italy and France.</p> <p> </p> <p>The lowest unemployment and highest employment rate of any of our competitors for the first time since the 1950s.</p> <p> </p> <p>Living standards up, for everyone, and for the poorest up most.</p> <p> </p> <p>The biggest reductions in child poverty and biggest increases in investment for decades.</p> <p> </p> <p>This isn't a country in decline.</p> <p> </p> <p>The British people aren't a people on the way down.</p> <p> </p> <p>We are winning. They are winning. </p> <p> </p> <p>And why did they vote for change? Because we had the courage of our convictions and we dared to change.</p> <p> </p> <p>So why is Government so tough? Because for all the progress, life's still tough for many hard-working families:</p> <p> </p> <p> if you're a young married couple trying to buy a house;</p> <p> </p> <p>if you're trying to balance home and family life;</p> <p> </p> <p>if you're worried about saving for retirement;</p> <p> </p> <p>if you're scared to walk out at night;</p> <p> </p> <p>if you, the taxpayer, see people who don't deserve it getting benefits, when you can't get the help you need and do deserve.</p> <p> </p> <p>Modern life is being perpetually stressed out. </p> <p> </p> <p>You can do more, travel more, consume more, live longer.</p> <p> </p> <p>But nothing stays still. It's always changing.</p> <p> </p> <p>And for the politicians, it's like having a conversation with people in an area where your mobile phone doesn't work properly. You know what it's like. You hear scraps of the conversation, most of it distorted and it's all intensely irritating.</p> <p> </p> <p>The public think the politicians don't know or care about their lives; and the politicians feel misunderstood.</p> <p> </p> <p>But I am an optimist about Britain; and the difference between an optimist and a pessimist is not that the optimist believes the world is wonderful and the pessimist believes it's beset by challenges; the difference is the pessimist believes we will be defeated by them; the optimist thinks the challenges can be overcome.</p> <p> </p> <p>And meanwhile think how lucky we are.</p> <p> </p> <p>Lucky to have been able to change our Party from one of permanent opposition to one that can compete for government on equal terms.</p> <p> </p> <p>Lucky to be in a country as great as this serving a people as decent as the British people.</p> <p> </p> <p>Lucky to have a Cabinet of talented men and women I'm proud to call friends as well as colleagues.</p> <p> </p> <p>I won't list them all. You know who they are. They know how much I value what they do.</p> <p> </p> <p>But I will mention the two who have been with me, in Opposition and in Government in the same jobs every step of the way. Gordon and John, the one a personal friend for twenty years and the best Chancellor this country has ever had and the other the strongest, most loyal deputy any leader could ever wish for.</p> <p> </p> <p>And we are lucky in our Opposition. </p> <p> </p> <p>I know people say we should take the Lib Dems seriously. But I can't. </p> <p> </p> <p>I like Charles incidentally.</p> <p> </p> <p>But recently he asked </p> <p> </p> <p>\"The Lib Dems are doing well but we have to answer the question: what do you stand for?\"</p> <p> </p> <p>Charles, my strong advice is: don't go there.</p> <p> </p> <p>The great advantage of the Lib Dems is precisely that no-one knows what they stand for.</p> <p> </p> <p>If they ever find out it'll be the end of you.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Lib Dems voted against every single measure for action against ASB;</p> <p> </p> <p>against withdrawing benefits from failed asylum seekers even when all their appeals were finished;</p> <p> </p> <p>and they believe you can get an extra \u00a330 billion in tax in one Parliament just from top-rate taxpayers, to pay for spending pledges they can't possibly afford.</p> <p> </p> <p>Meanwhile the other part of their Party wants to change our NHS for a system of compulsory private medical insurance.</p> <p> </p> <p>Believe me, Charles, leave the public in blissful ignorance.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Tories by contrast, don't need to ask what they stand for.</p> <p> </p> <p>They know what they stand for.</p> <p> </p> <p>Unfortunately for them, so do the British people.</p> <p> </p> <p>Two recessions, 10 per cent mortgage rates, the poll tax, 3 million unemployed, opposition to the minimum wage and crime doubled.</p> <p> </p> <p>Michael Howard did well at first because people had forgotten him. Now they've remembered.</p> <p> </p> <p>All you need to know is that when his advisers told him the Tories had to become a Party of the future, he brought back John Redwood. </p> <p> </p> <p>It is New Labour that now wears the one nation mantle.</p> <p> </p> <p>And the daftest thing said about New Labour is not the usual \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\"</p> <p> </p> <p>Like someone I met at the TUC who said what have you ever done for trade unionists?</p> <p> </p> <p>I said \"what about the right to union recognition?\"</p> <p> </p> <p>\"Yeah, but apart from that?\"</p> <p> </p> <p>\"The first ever minimum wage\"</p> <p> </p> <p>\"Yeah, alright, but ....\"</p> <p> </p> <p>\"Or the Social Chapter, paid holidays, restoration of union rights at GCHQ, an end to blacklisting, information and consultation rights\".</p> <p> </p> <p>Then he said: \"Yeah, but no-one knows about it\".</p> <p> </p> <p>I said \"Well, try telling them.\"</p> <p> </p> <p>It's not that.</p> <p> </p> <p>Someone showed me an article recently about how:</p> <p> </p> <p> \"Tony Blair has marginalised the Tories\".</p> <p> </p> <p>I thought it's a change to read something nice. Then I realised it was a criticism.</p> <p> </p> <p>Like, after years in which people thought the Labour Party was unfit to govern, now they think the Tories are. And I should be really sorry about it.</p> <p> </p> <p>The trouble is even now, even after the lessons of 18 years of opposition followed by two terms of Government, we still think they're the Party of Government, they're the ruling class and we're not part of it. And we're not. Neither should we be.</p> <p> </p> <p>But the point is: Britain doesn't need a ruling class today.</p> <p> </p> <p>The rulers are the people.</p> <p> </p> <p>The reason the Tories are marginalised is they refuse to accept we're equals.</p> <p> </p> <p>They still think they don't need to ask any fundamental questions about today's Tory Party.</p> <p> </p> <p>They just hope that we'll buckle.</p> <p> </p> <p>Well we won't.</p> <p> </p> <p>If we have the heart to hold true to our values; and the head to understand the future in which they have to work.</p> <p> </p> <p>What have we learnt in Government?</p> <p> </p> <p>The present is thrown out with scarcely time to become familiar; before a new future emerges to assert itself.</p> <p> </p> <p>Sure, we're proud of our record. Record economic stability in the first term.</p> <p> </p> <p>Record investment in the second.</p> <p> </p> <p>Record numbers of jobs in both.</p> <p> </p> <p>A fairer Britain, yes.</p> <p> </p> <p>Better than Tory Britain, I should hope so.</p> <p> </p> <p>But not yet a Britain in which as our constitution puts it: power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you have professional parents you are five times more likely to go to university.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you live in a smart part of town you are half as likely to be the victim of crime.</p> <p> </p> <p>Company directors aren't the ones losing their pension.</p> <p> </p> <p>There is a glass ceiling on opportunity in this country. We have raised the ceiling. We haven't broken it.</p> <p> </p> <p>It's great we introduced 2\u00bd hours free nursery education.</p> <p> </p> <p>But if your job means working til 5pm what good is that?</p> <p> </p> <p>The New Deal gave half a million youngsters a job. But what happens when they want a career?</p> <p> </p> <p>No inner city London borough now gets fewer than 40 per cent of its pupils with good GCSEs, up from as low as 25 per cent in 1997. That's still 60 per cent not good enough.</p> <p> </p> <p>It's wonderful that maximum waiting times have come down from 18 months in 1997 to six months by the end of next year.</p> <p> </p> <p>But I would not want a member of my family to wait in pain, let alone for 6 months.</p> <p> </p> <p>And we may have a stable economy, but every business I visit tells me however well Britain does now, within a decade hundreds of thousands of UK jobs will go to China and India unless we build a wholly new platform of economic opportunity in knowledge, skills and science.</p> <p> </p> <p>For the wealthy few, every one of those challenges of the future can be overcome.</p> <p> </p> <p>The third term mission is to overcome them for the many.</p> <p> </p> <p>Changing Britain for better. For good.</p> <p> </p> <p>Not a society where all succeed equally - that is utopia; but an opportunity society where all have an equal chance to succeed; that could and should be 21st century Britain under a Labour Government.</p> <p> </p> <p>Where nothing in your background, whether you're black or white, a man or a woman, able-bodied or disabled stands in the way of what your merit and hard work can achieve.</p> <p> </p> <p>Where hard working families who play by the rules are not going to see their opportunities blighted by those that don't.</p> <p> </p> <p>And where if any of our citizens, no matter how poor, is in sickness or need, they get the best care available without any regard to their wealth.</p> <p> </p> <p>Power, wealth and opportunity in the hands of the many not the few. </p> <p> </p> <p>Not our hands.</p> <p>But theirs.</p> <p> </p> <p>Fairness in the future will not be built on the state, structures, services and government of times gone by.</p> <p> </p> <p>Their values remain.</p> <p> </p> <p>But the reality of life has changed.</p> <p> </p> <p>The relationship between state and citizen has changed.</p> <p> </p> <p>People have grown up. They want to make their own life choices. Their expectations, their ambitions, their hopes are all different and higher. </p> <p> </p> <p>The 20th century traditional welfare state that did so much for so many has to be re-shaped as the opportunity society capable of liberation and advance every bit as substantial as the past but fitting the contours of the future.</p> <p> </p> <p>And this will be a progressive future as long as we remember that the reason for our struggle against injustice has always been to liberate the individual. The argument is not between those who do and those who do not love freedom. It is between the Conservatives who believe freedom requires only that Government stand back while the fittest and most privileged prosper. And we who understand, that freedom for the individual, for every individual, whatever their starting point in life, is best achieved through a just society and a strong community.</p> <p> </p> <p>In an opportunity society, as opposed to the old welfare state, government does not dictate; it empowers.</p> <p> </p> <p>It makes the individual - patient, parent, law-abiding citizen, job-seeker - the driver of the system, not the state.</p> <p> </p> <p>It sets free the huge talent of our public servants and social entrepreneurs whose ability is often thwarted by outdated rules and government bureaucracy. </p> <p> </p> <p>It changes how government works, to open up the means of delivery to every resource, public, private and voluntary that can deliver opportunity based on need not wealth.</p> <p> </p> <p>Sometimes I hear people describe \"choice\" as a Tory word. It reminds me of when I first used to knock on doors as a canvasser and was told if they owned their own home they were Tories.</p> <p> </p> <p>Choice a Tory word?</p> <p> </p> <p>Tell that to 50 per cent of heart patients who have exercised it to get swifter operations and help bring cardiac deaths down 16,000 since we came to power. </p> <p> </p> <p>Or to the parents who have made the new City Academy Schools so popular in areas of the greatest social disadvantage.</p> <p> </p> <p>Or the people I met in Teesside a couple of weeks ago who have transformed their neighbourhood, yes with Government money but most of all, by making their decisions, their choices about how it was spent and how their community was run.</p> <p> </p> <p>Choice is not a Tory word.</p> <p> </p> <p>Choice dependent on wealth; those are the Tory words. </p> <p> </p> <p>The right to demand the best and refuse the worst and do so not by virtue of your wealth but your equal status as a citizen, that's precisely what the modern Labour Party should stand for.</p> <p> </p> <p>So here are ten things a future Labour third term can do for Britain's hard-working families.</p> <p> </p> <p>1. Widen the circle of opportunity by low mortgage rates, rising living standards and more jobs in every region of the UK; special help for first time homebuyers and in a week where the Tories are advocating an inheritance tax cut which gives \u00a32 billion to the richest 5 per cent of estates, Labour's priority will be tax relief for the millions of hard-working families not tax cuts for the wealthy few.</p> <p> </p> <p>2. A society where we put the same commitment to quality vocational skills as we do academic education, with new vocational courses at school, every adult given skills free of charge up to level 2 and further support for level 3, and 300,000 Modern Apprenticeships at the workplace.</p> <p> </p> <p>3. Every parent with the choice of a good specialist school, 200 new City Academies all in areas of deprivation, but with no return to selection at 11; new powers for heads to tackle disruptive pupils; all secondary schools part of the Building Schools for the Future programme, and as each wave of schools is rebuilt, modern sports facilities in every one, with a guaranteed number of hours of sport per week. And let's work to bring the Olympics to London in 2012 and have a sporting legacy not just for the capital but for the whole country.</p> <p> </p> <p>4. All patients able to choose their hospital, to book the time and date for treatment. Maximum waiting times down from eighteen months to eighteen weeks. 100 new hospital schemes, 2,700 GP premises improved and modernised already with more to come, life expectancy up, cardiac and cancer deaths down.</p> <p>The NHS safe in the patient's hands.</p> <p> </p> <p>5. Life made easier for families. More choice for mums at home and at work. Universal, affordable and flexible childcare for the parents of all 3-14 year-olds who want it from 8am in the morning to 6 at night and a Sure Start Children's Centre in every community of Britain.</p> <p> </p> <p>6. Security and dignity for everyone in retirement. Year by year we will work to increase the numbers who can move off benefit and into work, whether from Job Seekers Allowance, Incapacity Benefit or any other benefit, and with the money saved, design a pension system that has the basic state pension at its core; gives special help to the poorest and provides incentives to save for hard-working families whatever their wealth or income.</p> <p> </p> <p>7. Our country and its people prospering in the knowledge economy. Increasing by \u00a31 billion the investment in science, boosting support to small businesses and ending the digital divide by bringing broadband technology to every home in Britain that wants it by 2008.</p> <p> </p> <p>8. On the back of the success of the ASB legislation and record numbers of police, we will take a new approach to the whole of law and order. </p> <p>By the end of the next Parliament, all communities with their own dedicated policing team ; and the local community as well as the police have a say how it is policed. </p> <p>There will be a radical extension of compulsory drug testing for offenders; a doubling of investment in drug treatment; summary powers to deal with drug dealers and with the violence from binge-drinking; and those believed to be part of organised crime will have their assets confiscated, their bank accounts opened up and if they intimidate juries, face trial without a jury. </p> <p> </p> <p>9. We will introduce identity cards and electronic registration of all who cross our borders. We have cut radically the numbers of failed asylum seekers. By the end of 2005, and for the first time in Britain, we will remove more each month than apply and so restore faith in a system that we know has been abused.</p> <p> </p> <p>But we will welcome lawful migrants to this country; we will praise not apologise for our multi-cultural society and we will never play politics with the issue of race.</p> <p> </p> <p>10. A fair deal for all at work. An opportunity society is one in which we stop ignoring the lives of the millions of hard working low paid families who do the jobs that we all rely on. The jobs that get overlooked, the workers who we too often see right through, walk straight past, take for granted. The office cleaners who do the early morning shift, clearing away the mess before the office is filled. The security guards staying vigilant through the night. The dinner ladies, who cook meals for hundreds of kids in the school canteen five days a week. The hospital porters who often do as much for patient care as the nurse. For them, we offer not just the respect they deserve, but the guarantee of a decent income, a rising minimum wage, equal pay between men and women, four weeks paid holidays from now on plus bank holidays. </p> <p> </p> <p>There they are: ten pointers to what a third term Labour government would do for Britain's hard-working families.</p> <p>Don't tell me that's not worth fighting for.</p> <p> </p> <p>A stronger, fairer, more prosperous nation.</p>",
  "Tony Blair's keynote speech to the Labour party conference in Brighton was twice interrupted today. <p>The first interruption came from protesters against the war in Iraq, while the second was from pro-hunt demonstrators. </p> <p>Shortly after the prime minister had risen to address his audience, a man - who later gave his name as Hector Christie - shouted: \"You've got blood on your hands.\" </p> <p>Mr Christie, who said he was from Labour's Torridge and West Devon constituency party, explained he had staged the protest because of the \"illegal war\" in Iraq. He also accused Mr Blair of \"doing nothing\" about climate change. </p> <p>Mr Christie was removed from the hall and taken away by police. As he was led away, he complained about the tightness of his handcuffs and said: \"Tens of thousands of people are being killed unnecessarily. Tens of thousands. </p> <p>\"I am not a serviceman. I know soldiers, friends out there, who hate Tony Blair. He should be impeached for this war in Iraq.\" </p> <p>The prime minister was unfazed by the interruption, saying the heckler was lucky to be free to voice his protest. Around 15 minutes later, there was another interruption from a small group of protesters. One, Tom Leek, from Ledbury, Herefordshire, said he was a member of the Countryside Alliance and was protesting against the \"rushing through\" of the anti-hunting bill. </p> <p>He was ejected from the hall and, as he was led away by officers, said he had only joined the Labour party two days ago, raising questions about security at the conference. </p> <p>Mr Leek, who was jeered as he was led through the hall, told reporters on his way out: \"It's beholden on everybody to fight this kind of legislation. </p> <p>\"What's next? If they are going to base laws on this kind of prejudice, how can we rest in our beds? They are trying to use the Parliament Act to force through legislation that's based on prejudice and hate. </p> <p>\"My grandfather was a friend of Keir Hardie, and he helped set up the Labour party in south Wales. He's buried 25 yards from my front door, and I can hear him spinning in his grave.\" </p> <p>Earlier, around 8,000 pro-hunting demonstrators, with around 1,000 dogs, had marched to the conference centre in a Countryside Alliance protest against the anti-hunting bill.</p> <p>Some demonstrators had left the decomposing carcasses of a horse, a cow and two calves in the city centre. <br><a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/labour2004/story/0,14991,1314699,00.html\">Hunt protesters dump carcasses in Brighton</a></p>",
  "<p>The housing minister, Keith Hill, has conceded that the government is prepared to negotiate the policy on the future of council-run housing following a humiliating defeat on the issue at Labour's conference.</p> <p>Labour party delegates voted overwhelming against the leadership on Sunday in favour of a resolution stating that tenants should not be financially penalised if they opted to keep their homes under council control.</p> <p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, and the local government minister, Nick Raynsford, have both suggested that the government planned to ignore the vote.</p> <p>Mr Raynsford said: \"The possibility of local authorities being able to borrow on the open market without limit if council tenants vote not to stock transfer ... is fantasy land.\"</p> <p>But Mr Hill has been more conciliatory. Speaking at a Unison fringe meeting last night, Mr Hill said: \"We recognise the vote. We are negotiating with the various interested parties.\"</p> <p>Until Sunday's vote, Mr Hill had insisted that councils would only get extra money to repair their homes if they switched them to new management under one of the government's three favoured options - housing associations, private finance initiative consortia, or arm's length management organisations (almos).</p> <p>He and the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, have repeatedly stated that there will be no so-called \"fourth option\" to allow councils to run and repair the homes themselves.</p> <p>But Mr Hill now appears ready to backtrack. He said: \"We will look at the financial framework within which local authorities have to approach stock transfer and almos.\"</p> <p>Daniel Zeichner, chairman of the Labour party in the east of England, who moved the resolution, said: \"I don't think they can ignore the vote. </p> <p>\"From what Keith Hill was saying last night it is clear that they are keen to keep talking about it. There are some differences of opinion, but we were quite close to coming to an agreement on Sunday. I'm sure discussions will continue. Policy changes all the time, it's a question of how its done and how it is presented.\"</p> <p>He added: \"John Prescott has acknowledged some of the points we were making about the unfairness and the lack of a level playing field [between councils and housing associations]. The issue is what you do about it.\"</p> <p>Mr Brown said yesterday that the government had no money to allow councils to repair homes themselves. </p> <p>Mr Zeichner said: \"We understand that there is not an endless pot of money, nor do we expect the chancellor to come up with it. The issue is what you do with the money that is already being spent. We could be using some of that money to enhance the prudential borrowing regime. These are some of the issues that are being talked about.\"</p> <p>The Labour vote strengthens the bargaining position of Camden council, a well-performing authority, whose tenants have rejected all three of the government's options.</p> <p>Camden's Labour leader, Dame Jane Roberts, a member or Labour national policy forum said: \"The vote shows the overwhelming strength across different sections of the party. It would behove the government to listen carefully to that.\"</p> <p>But she added that Camden was still \"up a gum tree\" in terms of how it would get the money to improve its homes.</p> <p>She added: \"I've been talking to Keith Hill repeatedly and I hope to continue to be able to do so.

  "<p>Three British bankers have been accused of fraud \"as a means to prosecute major figures in the Enron scandal\", a court heard today. </p> <p>The trio of former NatWest investment specialists are alleged to have worked with two executives from the failed US energy giant to defrauded a subsidiary of the NatWest subsidiary. </p> <p>The men are not being investigated by British authorities, but because correspondence was sent between London, Houston and the Cayman Islands during the transaction in question, the US government wants the men to be extradited to face seven counts of wire fraud in a Texas court. </p> <p>David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew, all 42, deny all the charges against them. They are being \"used as a weapon\" in the Enron investigation, London's Bow Street magistrates court was told. </p> <p>\"The US did not really want to prosecute them for defrauding their bank in London but to get these defendants to implicate people in the Enron scandal,\" said Alun Jones QC, for the defence. \"The reason these proceedings were advanced was to advance the case against American targets. It was simply a British means to an American end.\" </p> <p>Mr Jones said his clients had contacted the Crown Prosecution Service, the Financial Services Authority, the Serious Fraud Office and the home secretary, David Blunkett, but none of them had decided to launch an investigation in Britain. </p> <p>\"This is not somebody burgled who hasn't reported the burglary. We have made every genuine effort to ask that there's an investigation. There has been no allegation by NatWest bank to anybody saying 'We believe we have been defrauded',\" he said.</p> <p> Prosecutors allege that in 2000, the three British bankers conspired with Mr Fastow and Mr Kopper to defraud a NatWest subsidiary of millions of dollars. They allegedly advised the bank to sell its interest in a subsidiary of LJM, a Fastow-run partnership, to another Fastow-created entity for $1m when it was worth much more. Following the sale Mr Fastow, Mr Kopper and the bankers divided $19m among themselves, with the bankers allegedly pocketing $7.3m.</p> <p>In June, district judge Nicholas Evans, who is also presiding over today's hearing, ruled that the requirements of Section 137 of the Extradition Act 2003 were satisfied, meaning that the alleged offences did qualify for potential extradition. </p> <p>During today's proceedings - which are due to last three days - the bankers' lawyers argued that because of the time which had elapsed between the alleged offences and the issue of the extradition order it would be a breach of their human rights if they were extradited. </p> <p>It is the first time the new Extradition Act - brought in by Mr Blunkett to trap suspected terrorists - will be tested in the British courts. The radical Muslim cleric, Abu Hamza, faces an extradition hearing under the same legislation in October.</p> <p>The three bankers face 18 months in prison before a trial, and up to 35 years in prison and a fine if convicted on all counts. A ruling against the three men may make it easier for US authorities to extradite businessmen that local regulators do not pursue. </p> <p>The FSA, Britain's financial watchdog, has said in letters to the men that it will await the outcome of the US process before deciding on action.</p>",
  "<p>Within the UK there are relatively few possibilities to start your EFL career. </p> <p>The key to securing work is to have a number of years of Tefl teaching experience behind you, ideally gained in different countries around the world. You need to make it clear to your employer that you are a career EFL teacher, rather than a gap-year EFL teacher.</p> <p>But, if you really are unable to get abroad, there are a couple of alternative routes you might wish to consider. </p> <p>First, temporary English teaching positions are usually available over the summer in established year-round schools, or in summer schools, which operate only during the busy season. It may be that if you can first secure work there, the school will be so impressed it will offer you a year-round position, although this may be on a series of renewable temporary contracts. Websites such as www.englishinbritain.co.uk will provide useful lists of summer school providers to contact. </p> <p>Second, if you have a home suitable to welcome international students, you might be able to sign up to teach English from your home, offering both accommodation and tuition for (typically) executive or company-sponsored clients. This option often suits more experienced people who may already have enjoyed a full career in a particular field, eg business, law, engineering, IT. This valuable, relevant industry knowledge, coupled with a Tefl qualification can be just what \"home tuition\" clients are looking for, and they are likely to pay considerable amounts of money for the service. You might already run a bed and breakfast business, and find that offering lessons for three or four hours a day provides a good source of supplementary income. There are a number of registered providers of this sort of service, with whom you can register once you have gained your basic teaching qualification. One of the better quality providers can be found at www.intuitionlang.com.</p> <p><strong>Paying to volunteer</strong><br> The burgeoning volunteering market has seen countless opportunities emerge for short-term placements abroad. </p> <p>At first glance this can seem a costly way of going about finding a job. These short experiences of around four to 12 weeks fall somewhere between humanitarian work and a fantastic exotic holiday. Basically, you'll be investing around \u00a31,000 for a four-week opportunity to teach English somewhere amazing. This becomes attractive from the viewpoint that it would be impossible to organise this sort of trip independently, and, more importantly, it appears to be charitable enough work to justify raising funds on the back of your volunteering, through sponsorship, coffee mornings and the like. Many organisations offering this kind of Tefl holiday even throw in a free introduction to teaching English. </p> <p>For the commercial organisations providing these volunteering schemes, their loyalties lie in getting fee-paying gappers on to the scheme, rather than focusing on teaching the indigenous population. Furthermore, there is a danger that for the people on the receiving end of teaching, they simply see a steady stream of unqualified teachers keen to form special relationships with their students, before vanishing a month later never to be seen again. </p> <p><strong>Genuine volunteering</strong><br> If you really wish to give something back, then this has to be the best option. For many years organisations, such as VSO (Voluntary Services Overseas), have been active in helping to marry first world expertise with third world need. These days, opportunities for recently qualified Tefl teachers are substantially reduced. Most of the positions, in Africa and China, are for teachers with enough experience to be able to train local teaching staff to then go out and teach back in their local communities. This means that experienced teachers or trainers are preferred.</p> <p>Cactus Tefl promotes the objectives of organisations such as ROKPA International, which has been concentrating its efforts in the rural areas of eastern Tibet. Tefl teachers are carefully handpicked for assignments, and the successful applicants are expected to pay for their own flights, which usually cost around \u00a31,000. Assignments typically last a year, and offer the kind of cultural experience most people will never get close to.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"http://www.cactustefl.com/tefljobs\" target_new\">here</a> for more information about volunteering with ROKPA in Tibet.</p> <p><strong>Finding work abroad before you go</strong><br> Many people successfully secure work abroad through websites and job ads in newspapers, and through hearing of vacancies from friends already abroad. Whatever the method, it's important to remember that it is not only the school that has to like you - you also need to feel comfortable that the school, staff, students, facilities, location within the town, contractual issues and policies seem right for you. </p> <p><strong>Finding work in-country</strong><br> Increasingly, people are heading off in search of work, rather than trying to do it from home. It might seem a bit of a risk, especially if you're on a tight budget, but we really think this is worth considering - particularly for the more competitive destinations, which include southern France, Spain and Italy.</p> <p>If you're planning to teach in Europe, the abundance of cheap flights makes this more accessible, and by having enough money to survive the first month or so, you should be able to source work fairly quickly, possibly by working part-time for a couple of schools. It's important to try to hit the country at a time when schools are recruiting - in Spain, for example, a good time to arrive is in September when the private schools have a large increase in student numbers and need new teachers.</p> <p>The key to securing work out of season may be to head for places that are off the beaten track, such as smaller towns and provincial areas.</p> <p>If you are considering this, it's also worth taking your Tefl course in the country you'd like to work in. </p> <p>Although you'll be too busy during the course to look for work, you will finish the course already familiar with the location, and by talking to your course tutors and other teachers, you'll also have an idea of the local Tefl market. You will also have gained experience in teaching a monolingual group of the nationality you'll be teaching in your regular job, which may be seen as an advantage.</p> <p>Finding a Tefl job in-country is where having the right qualification will maximise your chances of picking up teaching work quickly. </p> <p>Before you head out, it's useful to do some basic research into when certain countries have their high-season for taking on teachers. Some countries also require you to have a degree as well as a qualification, so you might want to pack a few photocopies of your university and Tefl certificates, and CV.</p> <p>Many schools offer the Cambridge Celta/Trinity CertTesol packaged with local language lessons and even add-on courses to teach younger learners or business English. These build in time for you to look for work, while you still have accommodation taken care of.</p>",

  "<p>W hen Charles Clarke, the education secretary, addresses Labour party delegates in Brighton this week, he will face criticism from some who think he has not done enough for comprehensive education.</p> <p>Comprehensive Future, a campaign backed by the one-time Labour deputy leader Roy Hattersley, is organising a fringe meeting tomorrow entitled Ending Selection - Third Time Lucky? It wants delegates to sign a declaration calling for Labour's manifesto to promise an end to \"all selection by ability and aptitude\" within two years.</p> <p>During the summer, ministers considered limiting the right of specialist schools to use aptitude to select up to a tenth of their pupils. But the campaigners will get their way on grammar schools only if Michael Howard, rather than Alan Milburn, is put in charge of drafting Labour's manifesto.</p> <p>For what they want is a pledge that would be a gift to Labour's opponents. It would lose thousands of parents' votes in marginal seats from Dover to Wirral South.</p> <p>This does not mean Clarke should ignore calls for more comprehensive education. It just means he should take the claims of Comprehensive Future with a large pinch of salt. For it disingenuously pretends that what exists in many non-selective secondary schools is comprehensive education. Yet the most unfair aspect of the current system is not that a handful of schools select some pupils by ability or aptitude, but that so many perpetuate class divisions by relying on selection by postcode.</p> <p>The truth is that many urban secondary schools that call themselves comprehensive don't have a genuinely comprehensive intake at age 11 because those that are oversubscribed offer places to children according to how near their families live to the school, or whether or not their brothers and sisters are already pupils there.</p> <p>Few realise that the law allows them to do things differently. Schools and education authorities can use what the government's admissions code calls \"fair banding\", which means they allocate places fairly to pupils based on their assessed ability. Places are then allocated proportionally to top-, low- and middle-achievers.</p> <p>If banding allowed pupils to come from a wider radius, this would also make the government's promise of greater choice through specialism more realistic. There can be a real choice of specialist schools only when the best schools are not skewed towards those families who happen to live in the catchment area.</p> <p>With the current catchment restriction, it is impossible for most parents to choose between a popular technology college a mile from home and a popular language college four miles away, because they wouldn't stand much chance getting into the latter.</p> <p>The existing system is particularly unfair to children from poorer families. If a good school is situated in a middle-class area, it is effectively closed to children living on a council estate a few miles away.</p> <p>The Social Market Foundation recently proposed that places in oversubscribed schools should be allocated by lottery. This would certainly be fairer. But no political party will want to face the voters promising to make school admissions a lottery (or more of one than it already is).</p> <p>A big expansion in banding might require a bit more work, but it would be easier to justify and just as fair. The system is already used in city technology colleges. It should be compulsory for the new academies, too, and strongly encouraged by ministers in every comprehensive school.</p> <p>Two other changes would be needed. School transport must become more accessible so that it is no deterrent to choice. The government's draft transport bill could make it easier, but on far too limited a basis. And there should be much better information for all parents about the choices available.</p> <p>Labour is right to want to put choice at the heart of its public services. But for choice to be open to every parent, and not just the vocal middle classes, it should be combined with measures that make school admissions fairer and more accessible to every child at the same time. Fairness and choice can and should go together.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Conor Ryan is co-author of Excellence in Education: The Making of Great Schools, to be published by David Fulton in November</p>",
  "And now we have to go out and win the trust of the people to do it. <p> </p> <p>When people talk of trust, I say this: </p> <p>I know manifestos rarely make best sellers.</p> <p> </p> <p>But any party activist who wants an answer to the question about trust go and read what we said we would do in 1997 and 2001.</p> <p> </p> <p>It's a happy ending because rarely has a political party been able to deliver so much of what it promised. </p> <p>And if you can't be bothered with the whole manifesto, get out those pledge cards.</p> <p> </p> <p>1997, five pledges. All delivered.</p> <p> </p> <p>Except its not now 100,000 off the waiting lists, its 300,000 and it's not 250,000 young people off the dole but 500,000.</p> <p> </p> <p>2001, five pledges. All delivered.</p> <p> </p> <p>Except it isn't 10,000 teachers, it's almost 20,000 and not 20,000 nurses but 60,000. And the minimum wage is not \u00a34.50 but now \u00a34.85 and set to rise still further. </p> <p>So a new manifesto is being written. A new pledge card is being prepared for insertion into John Prescott's wallet. </p> <p>And then into the hands of everyone of us as we knock on doors, visit the factories, tour the shops, get out and campaign with some fire in our bellies, with some pride in what we have done. </p> <p> </p> <p>And of course, every change will be hard - change always is; every time we act on the reality of the future, people will accuse us of reneging on the values of the past.</p> <p> </p> <p>But on the issues we have just discussed - the normal run of politics, you feel, the country feels reasonably confident.</p> <p> </p> <p>The problem of trust isn't primarily that, is it?</p> <p> </p> <p>It is over the decisions I have taken, the judgements about our future security I have made since I stood here in this hall, about to address the TUC on September 11th three years ago.</p> <p> </p> <p>And since then, as with every other country and its leaders the world over, those with America, those against it, political life has been dominated in a way we never foresaw.</p> <p> </p> <p>There was talk before this Conference that I wanted to put aside discussion of Iraq. That was never my intention.</p> <p> </p> <p>I want to deal with it head on.</p> <p> </p> <p>The evidence about Saddam having actual biological and chemical weapons, as opposed to the capability to develop them, has turned out to be wrong.</p> <p> </p> <p>I acknowledge that and accept it.</p> <p> </p> <p>I simply point out, such evidence was agreed by the whole international community, not least because Saddam had used such weapons against his own people and neighbouring countries.</p> <p> </p> <p>And the problem is I can apologise for the information that turned out to be wrong, but I can't, sincerely at least, apologise for removing Saddam. The world is a better place with Saddam in prison not in power.</p> <p> </p> <p>But at the heart of this, is a belief that the basic judgment I have made since September 11th, including on Iraq, is wrong, that by our actions we have made matters worse not better. </p> <p> </p> <p>I know this issue has divided the country. I entirely understand why many disagree.</p> <p> </p> <p>I know, too, that as people see me struggling with it, they think he's stopped caring about us; or worse he's just pandering to George Bush and what's more in a cause that's irrelevant to us. </p> <p> </p> <p>It's been hard for you. Like the delegate who told me: \"I've defended you so well to everyone I've almost convinced myself.\"</p> <p> </p> <p>Do I know I'm right?</p> <p> </p> <p>Judgements aren't the same as facts. Instinct is not science. I'm like any other human being as fallible and as capable of being wrong. </p> <p> </p> <p>I only know what I believe.</p> <p> </p> <p>There are two views of what is happening in the world today.</p> <p> </p> <p>One view is that there are isolated individuals, extremists, engaged in essentially isolated acts of terrorism. That what is happening is not qualitatively different from the terrorism we have always lived with.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you believe this, we carry on the same path as before 11 September. We try not to provoke them and hope in time they will wither.</p> <p> </p> <p>The other view is that this is a wholly new phenomenon, worldwide global terrorism based on a perversion of the true, peaceful and honourable faith of Islam; that's its roots are not superficial but deep, in the madrassehs of Pakistan, in the extreme forms of Wahabi doctrine in Saudi Arabia, in the former training camps of Al Qaida in Afghanistan; in the cauldron of Chechnya; in parts of the politics of most countries of the Middle East and many in Asia; in the extremist minority that now in every European city preach hatred of the West and our way of life. </p> <p> </p> <p>If you take this view, you believe September 11th changed the world; that Bali, Beslan, Madrid and scores of other atrocities that never make the news are part of the same threat and the only path to take is to confront this terrorism, remove it root and branch and at all costs stop them acquiring the weapons to kill on a massive scale because these terrorists would not hesitate to use them.</p> <p> </p> <p>Likewise take the first view, then when you see the terror brought to Iraq you say:</p> <p> </p> <p>there, we told you; look what you have stirred up; now stop provoking them.</p> <p> </p> <p>But if you take the second view, you don't believe the terrorists are in Iraq to liberate it. </p> <p> </p> <p>They're not protesting about the rights of women - what, the same people who stopped Afghan girls going to school, made women wear the Burka and beat them in the streets of Kabul, who now assassinate women just for daring to register to vote in Afghanistan's first ever democratic ballot, though 4m have done so?</p> <p> </p> <p>They are not provoked by our actions; but by our existence.</p> <p> </p> <p>They are in Iraq for the very reason we should be.</p> <p> </p> <p>They have chosen this battleground because they know success for us in Iraq is not success for America or Britain or even Iraq itself but for the values and way of life that democracy represents. </p> <p> </p> <p>They know that.</p> <p> </p> <p>That's why they are there.</p> <p> </p> <p>That is why we should be there and whatever disagreements we have had, should unite in our determination to stand by the Iraqi people until the job is done.</p> <p> </p> <p>And, of course, at first the consequence is more fighting.</p> <p> </p> <p>But Iraq was not a safe country before March 2003.</p> <p> </p> <p>Few had heard of the Taleban before September 11th 2001.</p> <p> </p> <p>Afghanistan was not a nation at peace.</p> <p> </p> <p>So it's not that I care more about foreign affairs than the state of our economy, NHS, schools or crime.</p> <p> </p> <p>It's simply that I believe democracy there means security here; and that if I don't care and act on this terrorist threat, then the day will come when all our good work on the issues that decide people's lives will be undone because the stability on which our economy, in an era of globalisation, depends, will vanish.</p> <p> </p> <p>I never expected this to happen on that bright dawn of 1 May 1997. I never anticipated spending time on working out how terrorists trained in a remote part of the Hindu Kush could end up present on British streets threatening our way of life. </p> <p> </p> <p>And the irony for me is that I, as a progressive politician, know that despite the opposition of so much of progressive politics to what I've done, the only lasting way to defeat this terrorism is through progressive politics. </p> <p> </p> <p>Salvation will not come solely from a gunship. </p> <p> </p> <p>Military action will be futile unless we address the conditions in which this terrorism breeds and the causes it preys upon.</p> <p> </p> <p>That is why it is worth staying the course to bring democracy Iraq and Afghanistan, because then people the world over will see that this is not and has never been some new war of religion; but the oldest struggle humankind knows, between liberty or oppression, tolerance or hate; between government by terror or by the rule of law.</p> <p> </p> <p>And let us demonstrate to Muslims here in Britain that these are values we apply to all our citizens, and change the law to make religious discrimination unlawful as we do with race, gender and disability.</p> <p> </p> <p>This party knows the depth of my commitment to the Middle East peace process and shares my frustration at the lack of progress.</p> <p> </p> <p>After November I will make its revival a personal priority.</p> <p>Two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in an enduring peace would do more to defeat this terrorism than bullets alone can ever do. </p> <p> </p> <p>Britain is now, committed for the first time in our history to the UN aid target of 0.7 per cent.</p> <p> </p> <p>Next year as President of the G8 along with action on climate change, we will try for consensus on a new plan for Africa, that not only on aid and trade but on conflict resolution, on fighting corruption, on the killer diseases Aids, malaria and TB, on education, water, infrastructure - a plan to lift that continent in hope and lift from ourselves the shame that so many human beings live and die in misery when we know together we could stop it; and when unchecked this misery some time, somewhere in the future will threaten us.</p> <p> </p> <p>But understand this reality. Little of it will happen except in alliance with the United States of America.</p> <p> </p> <p>And here am I, told by the pro-Europeans to give up on America and the Atlanticists to forget about Europe.</p> <p> </p> <p>And yet I know Britain must be at the centre of a Europe now 25 nations reunited after centuries of conflict the biggest economic market and most powerful political union in the world and I know that to retreat from its counsels would be utter self-defeating folly. And I know to cast out the transatlantic alliance would be disastrous for Britain. And I believe so strongly that if Europe and America could only put aside their differences and united around a common cause, the future could be different and better.</p> <p> </p> <p>So the decisions I've been called on to make are stark. </p> <p> </p> <p>When I hear people say \"I want the old Tony Blair back, the one who cares\". I tell you something.</p> <p> </p> <p>I don't think as a human being, as a family man, I've changed at all.</p> <p> </p> <p>But I have changed as a leader.</p> <p> </p> <p>I have come to realise that caring in politics isn't really about \"caring\". It's about doing what you think is right and sticking to it.</p> <p> </p> <p>So I do not minimise whatever differences some of you have with me over Iraq and the only healing can come from understanding that the decision, whether agreed with or not, was taken because I believe, genuinely, Britain's future security depends on it.</p> <p> </p> <p>There has been no third way, this time. Believe me, I've looked for it.</p> <p> </p> <p>But nor should we minimise the strength that unites this Labour Government and this Labour Party as we seek to win a third mandate for change.</p> <p> </p> <p>It is the lasting change we make to the lives of the British people that matters.</p> <p> </p> <p>It is the residents of Somers Town in Camden who told me how they are using the powers we have given them to fight back against the yobs who had made their lives a misery.</p> <p> </p> <p>It is the mothers I met at Dean Bank Sure Start in my own constituency delighted and proud that their children were getting so much better a start in life than they had.</p> <p> </p> <p>It was Natalie Barney I met in Nottingham, able to stay on at school and do A levels because of the Educational Maintenance Allowance - and last week Natalie started at Nottingham Trent University with 4 A levels to her name.</p> <p> </p> <p>It is talking to the decent hard working people of this country that gives me strength.</p> <p> </p> <p>And when I read out to you that long list of policies for the third term, I did so with absolute confidence that we will deliver them.</p> <p> </p> <p>Why? </p> <p> </p> <p>Because, whatever the events, unexpected as well as planned, along the way, on the central mission and purpose of our politics, on our plan to modernise our country, give a fair deal to everyone, build our economy on the talents of all, we are delivering as promised, and will deliver much more if we win that third term.</p> <p> </p> <p>It means having the courage of our convictions.</p> <p> </p> <p>Knowing that it we are to make the NHS deliver what it was created to deliver, free, universal, decent health care for all, we have to modernise it to meet the demands of a new age.</p> <p> </p> <p>Knowing that unless we offer more than the standard comprehensive, parents will desert our state schools and the whole of our society will suffer.</p> <p> </p> <p>Knowing that we will not solve our transport problems by traditional methods of funding or our pensions challenge without altering the rest of our welfare state.</p> <p> </p> <p>And there are the easy bits and hard bits of leadership.</p> <p> </p> <p>There's no doubt which is preferable. But true leadership means doing both. Without the climb, you don't hit the peak.</p> <p> </p> <p>And we can reach it.</p> <p> </p> <p>Our ambition is to make the change in our country and in our world lasting, irreversible. In the last century brief periods of progressive governments were rapidly extinguished. In this century we must ensure that the progressive case once made is maintained, and the periods of conservatism are the punctuation marks not the sentences in which our history is written.</p> <p> </p> <p>For so long, we knew only the importance and futility of Opposition.</p> <p> </p> <p>But because we dared to change, we dared to dream that we could win again. And we did.</p> <p> </p> <p>And now we stand, in a position no Labour Party ever dared to dream of standing before, with a third term Labour Government beckoning.</p> <p> </p> <p>With the values for today and the ideas for tomorrow, and a policy programme that will change the country for better and for good.</p> <p> </p> <p>Power, wealth and opportunity in the hands of the many not the few.</p> <p> </p> <p>That was and is our mission and our purpose.</p> <p> </p> <p>I want us to win a third term not so that we can go in the history books.</p> <p> </p> <p>But so that we can consign Britain's failings to the history books.</p> <p> </p> <p>Build on the progress we have made.</p> <p>Give everyone the chance to make the most of themselves.</p> <p>Deliver better lives for working families.</p> <p> </p> <p>United in our values, </p> <p>Proud in our record,</p> <p>Optimistic about the future,</p> <p>With the courage of our convictions, we can win the third term</p> <p>Deliver the lasting change.</p> <p>It is worth the fight.</p> <p>Now let's get out and do it.</p>",
  "<b>How do you feel about the Liberal Democrats in general? Are they a credible party of government? What are you hoping to see at the Labour and Conservative conferences?</b> <p>The Liberal Democrats are the biggest party to reflect many of my own attitudes and beliefs, so I watched their conference with interest. The Lib Dems, and their desire to abolish tuition fees, greater emphasis on environmental issues and decentralised power, appeal to me. I am extremely worried about the effect of top-up fees on students. As well as making university prohibitively expensive for many students, it sets a terrible precedent of indifference to debt for those students who do pay.</p> <p>Many people are worried about the Lib Dems becoming a party defined by their anti-war stance. However, I think we should be careful to acknowledge the importance of the war, and its shaping of today's political climate. Tony Blair faces many challenges from his own party regarding his conduct and his decision to go to war. He also faces challenges from Charles Kennedy. In one of the few parts of his conference speech in which Kennedy became truly animated, the Lib Dem leader demanded more answers on Iraq.</p> <p>In this respect, I think it may be prudent to have concerns about the war being the prime issue for the Lib Dems. Kennedy was only able to raise passion in himself, and in his party, in reference to the war and in rubbishing the Tories as official opposition. </p> <p>He was preaching to the converted (his party) and to the half converted (me). And yet his speech remained uninspiring and stoic. This could have been designed to contrast with Blair's grins-and-spin approach, and Howard's frankly unsettling smarm, as well as being an appropriate tone for the horrific political background of the hostage situation, but his inability to inspire confidence and excitement about his policies is worrying.</p> <p>The Lib Dems purport to be the opposition in waiting, but their opposition of some Labour policies left a little to be desired. I was disappointed to see opposition to ID cards, that vanguard of authoritarian regimes, based in cost, rather than in ideology, and reports of their treatment of Peter Tatchell in the Bermondsey byelection undermine the spotless image they attempt to project.</p> <p>Being too young to remember Michael Howard when he was home secretaryI don't share the feelings some have for him. But, luckily, Michael's here to help, and his attitude to the convention of human rights is increasing my dislike of him exponentially. I would have thought David Blunkett, with his promotion of ID cards, imprisonment without trial and the removal of the right to silence, would have been extreme enough, but Howard's suggestion that the Human Rights Act is the source of injustice in Britain today defies belief. </p> <p>The Lib Dems offer a refreshing contrast to Labour and the Tories' increasingly authoritarian attitudes, but I am yet to be convinced that they are the best choice of vote for me.</p>",
  "In late August and early September, as John Kerry's campaign for president hit one low point after another, bloggers of all stripes took to the web with pointed political advice for the candidate. They told him how he should attack Bush and how he should hone his message. They even wrote sample speeches for the candidate. <p>On September 13, for instance, Zackpunk, a regular contributor to the political junkie website <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/\">Daily Kos</a>, wrote in his \"diary\" - a kind of miniblog within the larger site - that while listening to Al Franken on the radio, two disparate facts about the Bush presidency fused together in his mind. One was the story, first reported by Bob Woodward, that when Bush told his secretary of state, Colin Powell, that he planned to invade Iraq, Powell warned the president that \"you'll own it all\". The other was Bush's campaign promotion of an \"ownership society.\" </p> <p>These two facts, Zackpunk said, left a \"huge opening for Kerry\", with an ideal speech from the senator looking something like this: \"Mr President, Colin Powell told you about this war that 'if you break it, you own it'. And now you're going around talking about an 'ownership society'. Well, Mr President, let me tell you what you own. A million jobs lost. You own that. A thousand soldiers lost. You own that. 1.4 million new people living below the poverty line. You own that. 1.2 million less people covered by health insurance. You own that. A 17% medicare increase. You own that. Health care costs skyrocketing. You own that. The tax burden increasing amongst the middle class. You own that. Mr President, if you want to talk about an ownership society, let's talk about what you own.\" </p> <p>The speech was a powerful, specific, fact-filled indictment of Bush. And on Daily Kos, when someone writes something as brilliant as that in a diary, other readers begin noticing, and if it's good enough the post can land on the Kos front page. That's what happened in this case, and Kerry's campaign seemed to notice. In a speech two days later, Kerry said, \"At that convention in New York the other week, President Bush talked about his ownership society. Well, Mr President, when it comes to your record, we agree - you own it.\" Kerry went on to enumerate Bush's mistakes and label his term the \"excuses presidency, never wrong, never responsible, never to blame\". </p> <p>It's possible that the Kerry people came upon their speech independently of Daily Kos, but Markos Moulitsas Zuniga, the site's owner, says that he suspects Kerry is listening. \"It's not that they're listening to Markos,\" he says. \"They're realizing that there's this huge community out there that has good ideas. There are 400 or 500 diary entries a day. If one in a thousand diary entries has something of value, that's a good idea every couple of days.\" </p> <p>Today, it seems that every online political junkie secretly - if not openly - believes he's James Carville, a strategist possessed of such uncontested political genius that a particular candidate would be crazy not to listen to his advice, especially if that particular candidate is John Kerry. It's possible to find people on the web who'll claim that they could do at least as good a job in winning political races as the veteran consultants on the inside. So what if these people have never worked in any actual campaign? At least some of them were warning, months ago, that the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth would be a problem for Kerry and that he should respond hard and fast - an idea that Kerry's team would have been wise to consider. </p> <p>How is it possible that amateur political junkies are potentially having an effect on actual campaigns? The answer is that the internet has fundamentally changed politics as we know it. There is just so much out there that we didn't have access to four years ago: polling data, fundraising data, media-buy data; instant access to every TV ad and press release and unguarded gaffe and well-timed leak to jolt the campaign; insider dish on what the media's covering and what it's not covering and why; and perhaps most fun of all, there are massive online communities in which hundreds of thousands of people submit their mostly corny, often silly and sometimes unimaginably brilliant ideas for how this candidate or that should run his campaign. \"As a political junkie,\" says Moulitsas, \"this is heaven for me.\" </p> <p>\"I don't think that most people delude themselves into thinking they're actually James Carville,\" says Michael Cornfield, senior research consultant at the <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/\">Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project</a>. \"But for many of them it's gratifying to pore over the poll data and all this other data and think about what you would have done. You know what I'd compare it to? It's like fantasy football. I don't mean to suggest that people are trivialising it, but politics does have these game-like aspects to it, and it can be gratifying in a number of ways to play the game.\" </p> <p>Jerome Armstrong, who runs the popular left-leaning blog, <a href=\"http://www.mydd.com/\">MyDD.com</a>, is 40 years old, and for much of his life he followed politics only \"on the periphery,\" he says. Only in the last few years has he come to see both the necessity and the excitement of civic participation, and in that short time he's taken to the game with all the gusto of a natural. </p> <p>Armstrong was an early fan of Howard Dean, and Dean's campaign manager, Joe Trippi, was an early fan of Armstrong's blog; the match was eventually consummated in Burlington, Vermont, where, during Dean's rise and fall, Armstrong decamped to work for the campaign. Now Armstrong is a full-fledged political consultant. He and Moulitsas have set up a firm to advise politicians on how to use the web to outmanoeuvre their opponents, much as Armstrong (and many others) helped Dean to do in his campaign. </p> <p>Armstrong's interest in web campaigns is genuine, and given his background with Dean, he is just as qualified, if not more so, as any veteran consultant to advise a candidate looking for online expertise. But Armstrong has educated himself in much more than the mechanics of web campaigns. Like Moulitsas, he's a political polymath, the kind of guy who can recite every competitive House race this year, and if you've got time he may well tell you the various candidates' fundraising records, their support in the party, and recent polling data for their race. </p> <p>\"I've been looking at the House races for about the last three or four days,\" he said last week, launching into a detailed discussion of the Democratic party's chances of regaining control of the chamber in November. \"It looks really close. If the whole thing goes like 3% toward the Democrats, they could win like 20 seats.\" (That's just his top-line estimate. See here ... and here for a much, much more in-depth analysis.) </p> <p>Armstrong's House forecast is based on polling data he's culled from news sources all over the web, and fundraising data he got from the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/\">federal election commission (FEC)'s website</a>. \"What I've been doing is, I've been looking at where the Republican attack money is going,\" Armstrong says. \"Like I've been looking into how the Republican leadership PACs [political action committees] are distributing money, which House races they're targeting. That way you see which races are competitive.\" </p> <p>Four years ago, it may have been possible to collect this data, but it would have been more difficult than it is today, and, anyway, without the distribution platform of blogs, doing this kind of research would have been pointless then. </p> <p>\"Ten years ago you'd have to go down to the FEC and get their filings and put it all in a big book and bring it back,\" Armstrong notes. \"Maybe like 100 people in the country would have seen it. This year, here I am just a blogger getting this stuff, and since I've got the time and the resources I can look into this.\" </p> <p>Moulitsas concurs. On the web, it's springtime for number crunchers. \"I've always been a political junkie,\" he says. \"But never before like this. There's no way I could have kept up with a Senate race in South Dakota, or a House race in Nevada, it just was not possible. Now, every newspaper's online, and with <a href=\"http://news.google.com/news?q=federal+election+commission+&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn\">Google News</a> I can have all this stuff e-mailed to me when news happens. I've set up all sorts of keywords. I'm always getting all this stuff. It's a whole different environment.\" </p> <p>In the grand scheme of technological progress, increased access by bloggers to political information isn't the most astounding development. Glenn Reynolds, the University of Tennessee law professor who runs the popular, rightish blog <a href=\"http://www.instapundit.com/\">Instapundit</a>, notes that \"if you look at a more general picture of the world recently, the difference between amateurs and professionals has vanished in a whole lot of ways. For instance, look at music - it used to be you only knew about studio stuff if you were a serious musician. The amateur would never know about it. But now you can set these things up at home. The insider tricks aren't insider tricks anymore, now that outsiders have access to the knowledge\". </p> <p>A similar thing has occurred in film and photography with the advent of digital imaging, or in journalism with the advent of the web and of blogs themselves. Why should political strategy be any different? </p> <p>The web's metamorphosis into a haven for armchair strategists seems all the more natural when you consider the fetishisation of political operatives that has increasingly become the obsession of all media covering modern elections. It's well established that there are not nearly as many stories about policy today as there are about campaigns and the personalities who people them. John Kerry's capacity to run a presidential campaign is deemed at least as important as his capacity to, you know, run the country. </p> <p>The success of the DA Pennebaker film The War Room, and K Street, and especially The West Wing - a TV show created by a political junkie as a gift to the rest of us afflicted with the bug - just underlines the point. One of the hottest video games in recent months has been <a href=\"http://www.politicalmachine.com/game.asp?c=1&amp;u=0\">The Political Machine</a>, which is no doubt the first game ever to feature as its primary villain the vexing mathematics of the electoral college. And finally, for proof that we are ever more concerned about the horse race rather than the issues of the presidential race, look no further than the talking heads on cable news, constantly plumbing the depths of a sole overarching political-strategy story line, \"What should candidate X do next?\" </p> <p>The amateurs playing politics online often come off smarter than those on TV, and you can interact with them, which makes playing the game fun. Because they are now actually involved in assisting political campaigns, it wouldn't be correct to include Moulitsas and Armstrong in this group of \"amateurs\". But they're definitely not professionals in the mould of the veteran experts advising either of the presidential campaigns or the political parties, and certainly their readers - who are apprised of much of the information that they collect - are amateurs. In this sense, what we're seeing in this election cycle is truly novel. Amateurs, the political junkies whose interest in politics used to go unfulfilled, now find themselves holding some of the mightiest data in politics, the kind of dish they used to drool over. </p> <p>It would be a bit too credulous to conclude that these developments will prove to be a boon to political campaigns and, more pressingly, to the quality of American politics. So far, bloggers and the readers of blogs have been most influential to campaigns through fundraising - especially for Dean, Kerry, Bush and many congressional candidates - and, in a few instances, they've affected the news cycle, most recently in their flogging of CBS News' now-discredited Bush National Guard memos. In the Dean campaign, Trippi and other advisers professed to rely on the readers of the official <a href=\"http://deancalltoaction.blogspot.com/\">Howard Dean blog</a> for at least some strategic advice. We'll never know if this advice ultimately helped Dean, propelling him to a position that he never would have attained without help from the bloggers, or whether, in the end, the cultish Dean movement drove people away from Dean and did in his candidacy. </p> <p>There is no easy way to measure the \"quality\" of the political strategy generated on the web in the comment section of sites like MyDD or DailyKos. \"It's all over the map,\" notes John Judis, the New Republic editor whose last book, The Emerging Democratic Majority, written with the political analyst Ruy Teixeira, serves as the basis for the popular blog <a href=\"http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/\">Donkey Rising</a>. \"It's just like in sports. Who's to say what's a good idea and what's not?\" </p> <p>But Judis also believes that much of the strategy offered up by denizens of lefty blogs is earnest, \"flowing from a genuine political commitment\", and is not out of the \"the sheer pursuit of consultancy as an abstract skill\". As such, he says, it wouldn't hurt political campaigns to monitor some of what's going on online. </p> <p>There is evidence that this is occurring, as witnessed by Zackpunk's ownership speech. But even if the blog audience does not serve up fresh strategic advice every day, it's at least useful to look at what the people online are saying if you're trying to attract them to your campaign, says Stirling Newberry, who blogs at the <a href=\"http://www.bopnews.com/\">Blogging of the President</a>. </p> <p>\"People are expert consumers, and it's much easier to find out what people really think about something like a consumer product if you observe them,\" Newberry says. If you go to a fan site devoted to motorcycles, you'll find out what's on the minds of potential motorcycle consumers. Likewise, if you go to a site devoted to politics, you'll find out what's bothering potential consumers of a political message - and you'll discover their problems even if their specific ideas or suggestions for improving that product aren't very astute. \"People really talk about the things they're worried about,\" Newberry says. \"A lot of people say that by watching these sites Kerry should have known that Swift Boats were going to be very important. He should have done something.\" </p> <p>One problem with amateurs holding the tools of professionals, though, is that they may not quite understand how to use them. During the past few weeks, there's been a spirited discussion between some bloggers over how to interpret and account for the volatility in some presidential campaign polls, especially a recent Gallup poll showing a huge Bush lead. Ruy Teixeira, the polling expert at Donkey Rising, has argued convincingly that the Gallup poll is off because it over-sampled Republicans in its calculation of voters \"likely\" to cast a ballot in November. Mickey Kaus, the resident blogger at <a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/\">Slate</a>, called that thesis nonsense, and offered just as convincing a theory to support Gallup's numbers. </p> <p>Such a fight, let's note, was unlikely to have come up four years ago. Then, we didn't have as many polls with which to compare one single aberrant poll, and far fewer people were interested in the mechanics of polling. We've now got inside access to dozens of polls and sites that collect and analyse polls, from the indispensable <a href=\"http://electoral-vote.com/\">Electoral-Vote.com</a> to <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/\">PollingReport.com</a> to <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/\">Real Clear Politics</a> to Donkey Rising. If you're an online politics junkie these days, you likely consume at least half a dozen new polls for breakfast each morning. </p> <p>But what's an amateur to do in the case of a real question about the proper way to use these new tools? Maybe there is a place online for real experts, people who specialise in such previously cloistered fields as opinion polling. Online, you sometimes see some very bitter, partisan fights over polls, with no small number of people charging that certain surveys are rigged. </p> <p>Looking over this world recently, Mark Blumenthal, a veteran Democratic political consultant and pollster, decided that his professional voice needed to be added to the mix. He didn't blame the amateurs for their occasional ignorance about polling. It's not their fault, he says, that his industry hasn't engaged with the people online. But now, he adds, it's time for that collaboration. \"My sense is there is a role for a source of information about polling. There's all this talk about manipulation, a conspiracy of the right or the left. Meanwhile, there's a community of social scientists who deeply care about how to draw a random sample, about getting things right. And the two groups aren't really talking to each other.\" </p> <p>The best way to get the two sides talking to each other, Blumenthal recognised, would be by starting a blog of his own to discuss the ins and outs of polls. That's what he did last week with a site he calls <a href=\"http://mysterypollster.typepad.com/main/\">Mystery Pollster</a>, and on his first day, Blumenthal got a link from Mickey Kaus and 15,000 page views.</p> <p>Blumenthal says he wants the site to serve as a bridge between the professional political consultants and the amateurs who populate the web, and judging by the comments people have left him so far, he says that may happen. \"It's an experiment,\" he says of the project. \"A six-week experiment, and then we'll see what happens. It sure does look like it's going to take up all my spare time until then.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited.<br>\u00a9 Salon.com 2004</p> <p>Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a></p>",

  "More than 10 years have passed since the arrest of some of the mafia's top bosses, and the battle against organised crime in Italy appears to be running out of steam. <p>It is no longer a pressing political issue - even for the centre left opposition - and recent court verdicts have given the impression that the process of extricating southern Italy from under the heel of the mob has actually gone into reverse. </p> <p>This week, the brother of a well-known mafia victim launched an appeal to raise the money a Palermo court has ordered him to pay in damages to the lawyer who had represented the gangster convicted of ordering the murder. </p> <p>The body of Peppino Impastato - a leftwing radical who had publicly attacked and ridiculed his local mafia boss - was found on a railway line near his home in the western Sicilian town of Cinisi in May 1978. He had been blown to bits by a bomb - apparently the result of a botched attempt by a leftwing revolutionary to sabotage the railway line. </p> <p>Only 24 years later would the town's mafia chief, Tano Badalamenti, be sentenced to life imprisonment for ordering the murder in revenge for Impastato's pillorying of him on a satirical radio show.</p> <p>Impastato's relatives were naturally incensed by suggestions he had died in a clumsily executed act of terrorism - the conclusion reached by the first police investigation into his death, and a principal plank of Badalamenti's defence. </p> <p>They were so incensed, in fact, that his brother Giovanni declared, on a television talkshow, that anyone giving credence to such an idea was an \"imbecile\". </p> <p>The remark was taken exception to by Paolo Gullo, the lawyer who had argued exactly that - if unsuccessfully - at Badalamenti's trial. A judge agreed he had been defamed, ruling that it was fair enough to criticise someone for his arguments during a trial, but not to insult him. He ordered Giovanni to pay \u20ac5,000 (\u00a33,400) in damages and costs. </p> <p>Teresa Cordopatri, an aristocrat whose brother was killed by the mob, and who has waged a 30-year battle to keep her family's olive groves out of the clutches of the Calabrian mafia, has been the subject of an even more astonishing - and costly - libel verdict. </p> <p>She has been ordered to pay more than \u00a3100,000 in damages to four local magistrates for suggesting that they had been half-hearted in their efforts to combat organised crime. </p> <p>What was particularly surprising was that the alleged defamation had not been made publicly, but in a confidential letter to the superior council of the magistrature, the body responsible for upholding judicial standards. </p> <p>The council had declined to open an inquiry, but had passed the contents of her confidential complaints to the magistrates concerned, she told foreign journalists in Rome. </p> <p>Baroness Cordopatri was wounded, and her brother killed, in a mafia gun attack in July 1991. Her family had been under pressure from the 'Ndrangheta to sell its ancestral lands to a local crime boss at a knockdown price. </p> <p>Around nine months earlier, her brother had been the victim of an intimidatory attack - but appeals for help to the local judiciary had elicited no response. \"We felt as though we had been abandoned by the state,\" she said. \"If they had responded to my brother's complaints, perhaps he would not have been killed.\" </p> <p>The 71-year-old baroness now faces the paradoxical prospect of being forced to sell the property she fought to preserve from the mafia in order to assuage the aggrieved honour of the magistrates who allegedly let her down in her hour of need. </p> <p>To make things even more surreal, she has said that she is being impersonated by a woman claiming to be her cousin and the \"real\" victim of the 'Ndrangheta's persecution. </p> <p>The fact that the courts should have ruled against the mafia's victims in these two cases seems to reflect the spirit of the times. </p> <p>The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has been accused of doing business with the mafia during his career as an entrepreneur - an allegation made by numerous supergrasses but never confirmed by a court - and one of his ministers has caused controversy by suggesting that Cosa Nostra is a phenomenon Italians must simply learn to live with. </p> <p>Mr Gullo has said he will donate his libel damages to charity. Mr Impastato hit back by saying the charities should not accept, and bemoaning the fact that his family should end up being punished simply for defending Peppino's reputation. </p> <p>\"Sometimes, in this land, the only people to pay are those engaged in the battle for civilisation,\" he said. It is hard to disagree.</p>",
  "<b>How do you feel about the Liberal Democrats in general? Are they a credible party of government? What are you hoping to see at the Labour and Conservative conferences?</b> <p>It seems incredible today that, historically, the two main parties were the Tories and the Whigs, and that Labour is a relatively new concept (New New Labour?). At least that is what I remember from history classes, because within my lifetime it has always been Labour and Conservative. </p> <p>When I was young, what is now the Liberal Democratic party was a confusing little party with two leaders and no policies that never really did very well. I recall sad pictures in the papers of David Steel looking disappointed.</p> <p>So the change is really quite impressive. As party names Liberal and Conservative seem to make sense to me, because they suggest that they do what they say on the tin, whereas Labour (especially New Labour) as a party name suggests very little.</p> <p>The title of Liberal seems to stand for what our modern society has become: liberal! As Charles Kennedy said in his conference speech, it stands for tolerance and shifting values and, above all, change. </p> <p>Conservative ideals are, by their very nature, unworkable in our society; that things stay the same. Of course that will never be, and with technology improving almost daily, and culture and ideas from all around the globe available at the touch of a button, the concept of the \"conservative\" should theoretically disappear within a generation. </p> <p>But people are still afraid of change, and this is why the Lib Dems are still the third party. However, as Kennedy said, maybe we are entering an era of three party politics. I hope so. Although Billy Connolly once said that the fewer politicians there are the better. </p> <p>I like the ideals of the Lib Dems, I like their rhetoric and I even like their policies. It is, however, easy to like the policies of a party that has no track record in government, for that is when everything changes. I like the ideas of devolution and proportional representation, but once in power are they going to be brave enough to kick away the ladder that got them up there? </p> <p>The notion that budget-wise they have the books balanced is fine in theory; will it work in practice? A united Europe is a noble and important concept, but once committed will we lose control on a local level? The ideas of devolution and European union seem to me to make rather strange bedfellows. Who knows? But what the hell, give them a chance. </p> <p>If anything Charles Kennedy says is to be believed then they do seem the only viable option in our changing, modern world. But then, as likeable as he may appear, we must remember that he is a politician. And this still counts against him in my book.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Bank of Mum and Dad</strong><br> 8pm, BBC2 </p> <p>A bit of a torturous concept, this one - a series in which parents move in with their adult offspring to teach them \"the true value of money\". But despite the \"me, me, me\" attitudes of participants so far, it does hold a certain grim fascination. This week's subject is Warren Pickles, a 32-year-old systems engineer in a City bank, who has spent the last decade spending considerably more than he earns on items such as Gucci collars for his dog, Homer. Enter mother Maureen, a retired social worker who likes to shop at street markets and cares little for the high life. Can she save her son? Or will we witness the arrogant Warren crash and burn in a blaze of credit cards? </p> <p><strong> A Thing Called Love</strong><br> 9pm, BBC1 </p> <p>Nottingham is the setting for this new six-part drama from William Ivory which centres on one young man's search for true love. Paul Nicholls plays Gary Scant, whose monogamous romantic ideal is distinctly at odds with the prolific sexual antics of married friend Kelvin (Ben Miles) and the newly engaged Robbie (Chris Gascoyne). Kaye Wragg plays Mel, Gary's long-term girlfriend who is waiting for him to propose. Meanwhile, Gary is racked with indecision about Mel being \"the one\".

And Claire's relationship with Edie gathers pace when Claire agrees to sleep with Edie to resolve confusion over her own sexuality.</p>",
  "The Catholic church in Spain yesterday attacked government plans to legalise gay marriage, saying it would be like releasing a \"virus\" into Spanish society. <p>Spain's prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, and his Socialist party (PSOE) took office in April with an ambitious agenda of social reforms, including streamlining divorces and relaxing abortion laws. </p> <p>On Friday, Mr Zapatero's cabinet is expected to pass a bill that will allow same-sex marriages in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.</p> <p>The church has reacted furiously, and yesterday hit out with some of its harshest words yet on the subject of gay marriage. </p> <p>Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, spokesman for the Spanish Bishops Conference, said the church had nothing against homosexuals but feels that a union of two people of the same sex is not a marriage. </p> <p>Allowing this would create \"a counterfeit currency in the body of society\", Martinez Camino said in an interview on Spanish national television. Such legislation, he said, was like \"imposing a virus on society, something false that will have negative consequences for social life\". </p> <p>After Friday's expected approval in a cabinet meeting, the bill will go to parliament for debate. </p> <p>Mr Zapatero runs a minority government but is generally supported by two small leftist parties. The government says once the bill becomes law, gay couples would be able to start marrying next year. </p> <p>A survey published yesterday in the El Pais newspaper, which supports the Socialist party, said 62% of those questioned support gay marriage. </p> <p>If the legislation was passed then Spain would join Belgium and the Netherlands, which have already legalised gay marriage. </p> <p>Sweden and Denmark also have \"civil union\" laws for same-sex couples, which fall short of allowing outright gay marriage. However, in both of these countries the union can be blessed by the Lutheran church, which is the official state religion. </p> <p>In Spain, Mr Zapatero's government is planning to overhaul church-state relations. The deputy justice minister, Luis Lopez Guerra, last week called said there would be a \"road map\" correcting what he called \"undeniable advantages\" enjoyed by the Catholic church.</p> <p>Many Catholic schools are subsidised by the government, for instance, and on income tax returns, Spaniards can check off a box that will send 0.5% of their tax debt to the Catholic church. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, Mar\u00eda Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez de la Vega, told a news conference last week that the government did not plan to end state financing of the church, but acknowledged that reforms were afoot, although she gave no details.</p>",
  "Today's pro-hunting demonstration at the Labour party conference got off to a grisly start, as demonstrators left decomposing carcasses of a horse, a cow and two calves in Brighton city centre. <p>Two men were arrested as police confirmed that the dead animals were dumped in locations in the city shortly after 11.25am, half an hour before Countryside Alliance campaigners were due to march towards the conference centre. </p> <p>The pro-hunting group denied their members had been behind the stunt, but could not explain why their banners had been left at the scene.</p> <p>A police spokeswoman said: \"The horse had been left close to the town's train station and two calves had been laid on a footpath close to a fountain in Old Stein. </p> <p>Simon Hart, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said: \"However disgracefully the government treats rural people, and however provocative the behaviour of the John Prescott and other ministers there can be no excuse for this sort of behaviour. </p> <p>Forensic scientists were beginning inquiries with uniformed officers and council workers at the scene and efforts have begun to remove the decomposing corpses. </p> <p>In Old Stein, officers shielded their faces from the overwhelming smell of flesh as flies circled around the two calves' bodies. </p> <p>Police said that two men were arrested shortly after the animals were found when officers stopped a van in central Brighton. </p> <p>Both men were in custody and helping police with their inquiries into the incident. </p> <p>One onlooker said that the calves had been dumped at around 11.25am, when two farmers accompanied by a television crew had unloaded the carcasses from a van. </p> <p>He said: \"They looked like farmers and I think the men were quickly arrested by police. </p> <p>\"It's terrible for the people around here and must be a risk to public health. I hope they don't carry on acting like this because it won't win them any friends or help their argument.\" </p> <p>As the prime minister prepared to give his keynote address at 2.30pm, demonstrators threw eggs at the conference centre and senior Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, one of the leaders of those calling for a hunting ban, was seen to be jostled by the protesters. </p> <p>\"He looked very white and shaken. He was physically jostled,\" said one delegate. </p> <p>The 1,000 strong police security operation, codenamed Operation Otter, has not been bolstered for today's protest, although it is believed that officers have been issued with extra long batons, indented at the base to, to deal with protesters who cause trouble asn witnessed last week in front of the Houses of Parliament.</p> <p>Only 10 hounds - representing different breeds - were accompanying their owners in the delegation, which was following a straight route along the seafront, passing the Brighton centre which is hosting the annual Labour party conference.</p> <p>The remaining hounds were staging a \"static protest\" with their owners, to avoid a mountain of dog mess being produced on the promenade. </p> <p>For those marching, the chase was Tony Blair and his backbenchers, and their message was crystal clear - that hunting has not had its day.</p> <p>Many privately muse that if the government insists on outlawing hunting, then outlaws they are prepared to be.</p> <p>Lindsay Hill, from the Shropshire United Hunt, said her family's livelihood was at stake. Married to professional huntsman of 20 years, she has hunted foxes \"all my life\". Even the thought of prison would not deter her from pursuing a lifetime's passion because of some absurd law, she said.</p> <p> \"If this becomes law we lose everything: we lose our house, our entire way of life. This ban is a very unjust law. We just want to let the government know we are not going to go away and we are not going to accept an unjust law based on prejudice. I am prepared to carry on hunting if it is banned.\" </p> <p>Farmer Anthony Spencer had travelled down from Warwickshire. He doesn't blame Tony Blair, his sights are on the backbencher whom he sees as waging a \"vendetta\", rather than having any genuine motivation to save foxes. </p> <p>\"They do not understand the passion behind it\", he says of the government. \"If we don't protest they will just walk over us, I'm afraid. It is to show this government we are not going to take this lying down.\"</p> <p>Gavin Lee, from Nottingham, came down with friends to give their support to the hunt, even though he restricts himself to harecoursing and \"ratting\" with terriers. Describing himself as an \"amateur hunter\", the lorry driver from Nottingham says baldly that breaking the law will be small beer for those determined to protect their right to chase and kill animals for fun. </p> <p>Tony Blair beware: \"Blair is the gaffer\", says Lee. \"If he uses the parliament act we will hunt him down. We won't let it lie.\"</p> <p>Thousands of campaigners listened to further speeches outside the centre and hundreds more people crowded onto the pebble beach below. </p> <p>Police said an estimated 8,000 people had joined the march, along with around 1,000 dogs. Hundreds of riot police and dog handlers surrounded the front of the conference centre as several thousand pro-hunting supporters, many carrying placards, screamed and shouted.</p> <p>Several loud explosions, thought to be thunder flashes and fireworks, were heard to go off in front of the centre where the prime minister will shortly deliver his keynote speech.</p>",
  "<p>It was the year 2000, and Democrats were running on a record of peace and prosperity stewarded by the capable, if morally imperfect, Bill Clinton. It was a race that should have been won by their candidate, Al Gore. In fact, it was won by Al Gore, but the Rightwing Noise Machine kept it close enough to be stolen by the Republicans and their allies at the supreme court. </p> <p>What is the Rightwing Noise Machine? Conservatives in the United States have spent the last 30 years building a vast infrastructure designed to create ideas, distribute them, and sell them to the American public. It spans multiple think tanks and a well-oiled message machine that has a stranglehold on American discourse. From the <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com\">Weekly Standard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/today.guest.html\">Rush Limbaugh</a>, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/us\">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com\">Drudge Report</a> and Murdoch's <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com\">Fox News</a>, to (more recently) the mindless drones in the rightwing blogosphere, the right enjoys the ability to control entire news cycles, holding them hostage for entire elections.</p> <p>Gore learned this the hard way, as he faced a campaign of character assassination pushed by the right and abetted by a lazy-to-hostile press corps: Gore said he was the inspiration for Love Story. Gore invented the Internet. Gore exaggerated. Gore was boring. Of course, all of this criticism was flat-out wrong or grossly out of proportion to the alleged infraction, but it didn't matter: the media landscape offered no respite. In the US, talk radio was and remains a bastion of rightwing lunacy. Television coverage had become an extension of the Republican party, not just because of the influence of Fox News, but because conservatives had \"worked the refs\" so diligently that mainstream media outlets piled on their conservative \"pundits\" lest they be accused of \"liberal bias\". The political internet was dominated by the virulently rightwing <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/browse\">Free Republic</a> - still the largest political site to this day. </p> <p>There was no way for Gore to get out his message, or launch a counteroffensive. Given the circumstances, it was a wonder he won the race, even if our nation's Republican-dominated supreme court handed the keys to the White House to George Bush. </p> <p>The year 2000 was a wake-up call to many partisans like myself. Surveying the landscape, we could sense the flexing of the Rightwing Noise Machine's muscles, even if we were ignorant of its ultimate size and reach. We had witnessed the goring of Gore, yet sat by, helplessly unable to fight back. We saw the Democratic party get outmanoeuvred in Florida, legally and rhetorically. We looked around for a \"liberal media\", yet found nothing of the sort. </p> <p>It would be really sexy and dramatic to claim that a few brave blogger souls set out to build an alternative media structure, but that's not really true. We set out to write for ourselves, to provide an outlet for the angst we felt in a politically hostile environment - where criticising the president on domestic policy was somehow unpatriotic. And we weren't alone: there was a huge audience out there hungry for this content. And suddenly, the seeds of a liberal media blossomed online.</p> <p>And the blogs had company. While bloggers rode the Howard Dean campaign to greater prominence, more staid, institutional, and moneyed, liberals were also surveying the political landscape. They didn't like what they saw and they began to act. </p> <p>Liberal thinktanks sprung up to challenge their conservative counterparts. A new liberal talk radio network was launched. <a href=\"http://www.moveon.org/front\">MoveOn.org</a>, created to help Bill Clinton stave off impeachment, went from being a grassroots email list to a multimillion dollar media operation. Americans Coming Together will spend nearly $100m (\u00a355m) to register and turn out Democratic voters this November. Berkeley linguist George Lakoff founded the Rockridge Institute and is making waves in Democratic circles by showing how Republicans have hijacked the language (\"tax relief\", \"partial-birth abortion\", \"pro-life\"), and how Democrats can take it back.</p> <p>In 2000, Bush outspent Gore $193m to $132m. While Republicans still have a slight advantage in 2004, Democrats won't lose the White House because of money. But Republicans still control the White House, the Senate, the House, the supreme court and a majority of state governorships and legislatures, meaning they can control the agenda, while their Noise Machine can dominate the message and delivery of it. </p> <p>Liberal groups are fighting back, working to build a parallel infrastructure. My blog <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/\">DailyKos.com</a> receives 350-400,000 visits every day - double that of FoxNews.com and comparable to the Guardian's print run.

We don't have parity, but we're working on it. </p> <p>We all hope to have an impact in 2004, but there's reality: conservatives have spent 30 years building their infrastructure. We can't be expected to counter that in one year.

  "<p>The local government minister, Nick Raynsford, has confirmed that the government will ignore a Labour commitment to allow council tenants to stay under local authority control.</p> <p>Mr Raynsford yesterday echoed the words of the chancellor, Gordon Brown, when he ruled out implementing a housing policy amendment passed on Sunday by conference to allow council tenants a \"fourth option\" by restoring councils with the power and resources to repair their own homes.</p> <p>The government has until now insisted that extra cash to repair homes to bring them up to a decent standard will only be available if tenants vote to switch their homes to new management through three options: the private finance initiative (PFI), housing associations or arm's-length management organisations (Almos).</p> <p>Mr Brown made clear in an interview with the Today programme that any extra funding made available by the Treasury would be earmarked for extra choices in public service delivery, rather than council management of social housing.</p> <p>Mr Raynsford later rehearsed the same line when he told Guardian Unlimited that the prospect of making funding available to allow councils to continue managing homes was not feasible. </p> <p>Local government representatives had already been appeased on this point in exchange for the renewed right to build council homes again after a 20 year gap, he said. </p> <p>\"There really is a positive agenda [for social housing] and I think that local government want to be on board but it is simply not realistic to deliver the manifesto commitment,\" Mr Raynsford said. \"The possibility of local authorities being able to borrow on the open market without limit if council tenants vote not to stock transfer ... is fantasy land.\"</p> <p>Speaking of Sunday's announcement by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, to allow councils to build affordable homes on surplus public land by splitting off the cost of the house from its land value, Mr Raynsford admitted the government had yet to audit the amount of land which would be available for such a scheme, or how many homes would result.</p> <p>Under government proposals, properties for as little as \u00a360,000 would be made available by allowing councils to housebuild on public land - though solely through private public partnerships. </p> <p>The land would be treated as separate from the cost of building the homes themselves. Land value often proves to be the killer factor in overall house prices, often representing two thirds of the overall cost in the south and south-east, and pricing out first time buyers from the market.</p> <p>Only councils that had been successful in driving up council homes to decent standards would be eligible for the scheme, Mr Raynsford said. </p> <p>\"It is early days,\" he said. \"There is still a lot of work still to be done, but it has exciting potential because what it is going to do is incentivise public authorities to look for land that could generate public housing knowing a lot will be available for low cost housing.\"</p> <p>However, the scheme will not be mandatory and local authorities and other public bodies will be free to sell off their land to the highest bidder for cash if they choose, he added.</p> <p>\"There is a choice,\" he said, \"there is a degree of discretion. But if they want to be involved in providing low cost housing and keep ongoing interest in the land - which is the whole basis of the proposal - then they will come on board.\"</p> <p>The thorny issue of council tax increases also raised its head after Mr Prescott set the tone for councils on Sunday by signalling that council tax increases would have to be pitched even lower than last year.</p> <p>Like last year, Mr Raynsford once more refused to be drawn on \"acceptable\" council tax increases for next year, claiming this would be tantamount to \"crude universal capping\".</p> <p>This year, a total of five councils were capped in-year for setting tax rises deemed unacceptable by Mr Raynsford's department, with one further local authority and several fire and police authorities set to have budgets capped for the next financial year.</p> <p>\"It is for local authorities themselves to determine the [council tax] limit\", Mr Raynsford said. \"We expect them to be working to low single figures.\"</p>",
  "I woke up on the morning of September 16 in a cell at Charing Cross police station and realised that the previous day had not been a dream. <p>Our memorable incursion into the Commons very nearly did not happen, as its execution was more akin to an Ealing comedy than Mission: Impossible. The master plan was basic in the extreme: we would blag our way in, walk confidently and look as if we were meant to be there. It worked better than we could have imagined - I have had more difficulty trying to get into the Owners and Trainers Bar at Cheltenham, where I actually know people on the inside. </p> <p>We had decided not to offer any resistance if apprehended. However, it was faintly embarrassing when, having said my piece to the government benches, I suddenly became aware of exactly where I was. </p> <p>So what is needed to force a person like me to even consider pulling such a stunt? Those ministers - our legislators - who have decried our actions, were protesters in their youth and would have given their eye teeth to have gained this much publicity.</p> <p>The cry from the Commons that democracy must be upheld is dishonest in the extreme. Bad laws and a degradation of true democracy in this way means that all people should oppose the hunting bill as a threat to the liberties of the common people. This is far more than a little local difficulty over a very minor sport: it strikes at the heart of what we think of as the inherent tolerance of the British people. If the government can ride roughshod over this minority, who will be the next victim?</p> <p>Hunting may or may not be to your personal taste, but is it right that an individual moral dilemma should be decided by one house of parliament? Governance in this country is based on a two-chamber system. The duty of the second chamber is to act as a check and bring balance to laws passed by the lower house, which may have an unhealthy majority. As this second chamber is a product of Tony Blair's reforms, it is a bit rich that he now seeks to use the Parliament Act to force bad legislation through it.</p> <p>Some politicians have accused us of \"damaging the sanctity of parliament and harming democracy\". However, I maintain that what we did was in defence of democracy. By forcing through this pernicious - and by its own admission - divisive legislation, the government is enacting a law that is not based on fact but on prejudice. This is an extremely dangerous precedent to set, and it is the duty of everyone concerned about fair play and honesty - no matter their views on hunting - to oppose this dreadful legislation. </p> <p>It might well be that we have to accept a compromise solution to fit in with the 21st century's mania for control and licensing. However an outright ban flies in the face of all the evidence and the government's own Burns report. </p> <p>As the letters and phone calls of support pour in from all over the country (at least 50% from non-hunting people), the consensus of opinion is that we have burst the bubble of conceit that surrounds this government and brought international attention to the shameful way parliament is treating this issue. Our actions seem to have galvanised support in the countryside and gained us many friends outside of the hunting community. </p> <p>So what's next? The Labour party conference. I'll certainly be there and so will thousands of others concerned about losing their way of life just to gain backbench support for Mr Blair. People must stand together to fight this attack on our freedom. </p>",
  "Fourteen international students are tramping across the Millennium Bridge on the first day of freshers' week. It's grey and threatening rain but their eyes are wide, drinking in London's sights. They could be any of the thousands of students flying in from around the world for the new term. But these students are special. <p>Ten are from Israel, four from the occupied territories. Some are Jewish, some Muslim, some Christian. They represent the melting pot of the Middle East and they are about to spend four years living, working and studying together at City University.</p> <p>Usually they might be eyeing one another suspiciously, or living on either side of a security fence. Usually they might never meet. Instead, last week, they chatted confidently about their new halls, the things they had seen in the 24 hours since they arrived and what the term has in store. All things they firmly share in common.</p> <p>These are the first Olive Tree scholars. Each has been picked to study a degree of their choice, with all fees paid and a means-tested bursary. They include a student peace activist, a star of the Israeli cinema and the founder of an orchestra made up of young Israelis and Palestinians.</p> <p>The scheme is the brainchild of City's deputy vice-chancellor, Professor Steve Miller, and businessman Derek Tullett. They were mulling over the issue of scholarships in a cafe one day when they had the \"joint thought\" for the project. \"We're trying to develop a community of future leaders and professionals who are committed to peace and dialogue and reconciliation,\" explains Miller.</p> <p>\"The students we look for have got the academic and personal skills to develop enterprise and projects that will underpin peaceful cooperation in the future and who have absolute commitment to improving their futures in this way rather than other means, such as violence.\"</p> <p>It has been quite some build-up to last Monday, the students' first day in London: a year of fundraising, recruiting and selecting students, then interviewing them. The excitement of the first day is somewhat tarnished, though. Two of the students from Gaza were not allowed to cross the border to catch their flight to London and spent the whole of last week waiting at a checkpoint. University authorities \"pulled out all the stops\", eventually negotiating them a guaranteed passage to London five days later.</p> <p>Mahmoud Al Ashi, 20, is also from Gaza City. He spent three days sleeping on the street at a checkpoint in Gaza, then another seven nights at the border with Egypt before the Israeli embassy in London managed to persuade the guards to let him through. \"Those seven days I was supposed to spend with my mother in Egypt,\" he says. \"I didn't get that time.\"</p> <p>Ashi, like many of the others, has already been involved in community groups that bring together Israelis and Palestinians. He has also found small and personal ways of making contact. A year ago he met an Israeli online, and together they designed a network for traffic lights. \"It was not so beneficial as a project,\" he says. \"But it really is great for us to cooperate like that. We never met, we did the whole thing in chatrooms.\"</p> <p>Back home, his interest in making contact with his Jewish Israeli peers is puzzling for some of his friends and family. \"It's hard for people to understand ... why I would do this. Some people think I am coming to work as a spy. I am afraid to tell all of my friends.\"</p> <p>He believes the key to a more peaceful future is dialogue. \"When I talk with an Israeli person about the lives we lead, they find it hard to believe. There are changes that happen inside their minds. It's better than violence - it's education.\"</p> <p>Ashi's story is very different from another of his Olive Tree colleague's, Ranin Boulos, 20. Boulos grew up in the Israeli village of Neve Shalom Wahat al-Salam (Arab and Jewish oasis of peace). The village is famous throughout the Middle East as the home of both Jews and Arabs who live together peacefully. Boulos is also famous in her own right. She started acting as a child, featuring on the Israeli version of Sesame Street, moved on to theatre and has just finished shooting a film.</p> <p>\"I am Arab Palestinian,\" she says. \"I have Israeli citizenship. I am Protestant. I am a lot of things. But that's our problem out there, we have an identity problem.\"</p> <p>She has put her acting career on hold while she gets her degree, and hopes to work in Arab schools in Israel when she returns, providing acting and music lessons. This is an important element of the scheme. Each student will go home after graduating to spend a year on a community project. \"The aspirations of this scholarship are like my village,\" says Boulos. \"I feel at home.\"</p> <p>A parallel programme the students take alongside their degree will focus on cultural activities, to help them to settle into London life. But eventually this will provide a forum for them to tackle some of the more difficult aspects of the relationships they build up with one another - to resolve the conflicts their backgrounds, politics and lifestyles raise.</p> <p>Jane Clements, of the Council for Christians and Jews, a \"bridge-building\" educational charity, who set up the parallel course, says: \"We're not going to sit them down and tell them to come up with a new road map. Not at all. Obviously some people will discuss it as they go on. There will be difficult issues, and they need their own space to deal with it.\"</p> <p>But many of the students will find more to fill their time - Dimi Reider, from Tel Aviv, for example, who delivered his application for the scholarship two minutes before the deadline and wrote 600 words too much on the form. He wants to be a journalist.</p> <p>At Tel Aviv University, he says rather casually, he started a student movement for peace. Last November, he organised a small demonstration, and these demonstrations have since grown in number and turnout.</p> <p>\"Students in Israel are apathetic about politics even though they suffer as a result of it,\" he says. \"They have to go into the army; they have their school budgets cut to pay for the army, and they aren't safe.

Boulos says: \"It's not like we alone can bring peace. But it is something.\"</p> <p>Halevy adds: \"It's a start. Just like the orchestra.

  "British contractors in the Basra area of Iraq are following the kidnapping of Kenneth Bigley with concern and sympathy, but have questioned the wisdom of living and working in Baghdad without security or personal protection. <p>Many who watched Mr Bigley's impassioned plea for mercy on oversized television screens last week say that it would not have happened to them. </p> <p>There are an estimated 1,500 contractors and civilian security officers working in the British-controlled southern area of Iraq. The camps have been built and are maintained by contractors. The communications infrastructure - such as internet services for soldiers - is operated by civilians. Then there are those that work in reconstruction: engineers, experts in sewerage, electricity and oil. </p> <p>Those who have no military experience hardly ever travel outside the camps of the military zone designated Multi-National Division (South East) without an escort. The majority are accompanied by soldiers in \"snatch wagons\" - armoured Land Rovers - providing cover with heavy machine guns and SA80 rifles. Ex-military types, armed to the teeth, also provide escorts. </p> <p>None of the contractors are allowed to talk to the media because of companies' policy that speaking about the situation on the ground puts their lives at risk. Some spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, others point-blank refused. </p> <p>Sitting in a rest area in Allenby Lines, one of the camps in the enormous, secure coalition compound known as the A Pod, around the old Basra airport, one contractor said: \"It's an unfortunate situation that chap's in, but I don't know the security measures he had in place. </p> <p>\"He took an unnecessary risk. We live on camp and travel with green fleet [the British army]. There's no ifs, buts and ands about it. It's company policy, we don't travel without the army. If the army say you don't move, you don't move. </p> <p>\"My personal feeling is, if they offered me another \u00a310m to travel unescorted, I wouldn't do it. What has happened to him wouldn't put me off what I am doing at the moment. Travelling unescorted is what would put me off.\" </p> <p>One close-protection worker said: \"Where we fall down as British people is the arrogance that 'we will be safe because we are British'. </p> <p>\"You are a contractor, you know nothing about security. You come to Iraq, you are badly briefed, you think it is secure because you are British. You go and live in Baghdad and you are a target. You have got a pistol and you think that will protect you; well it won't. </p> <p>\"They have really got to be thinking more about their security, they really have. These guys know you are on your own, that you have only got one pistol. They know you have got no security. The Iraqi people might be poor but they are not stupid. </p> <p>\"What British contractors have got to do is make sure their security is 100%. They have got to have a company looking after them 24/7. </p> <p>\"This man has been too blatant. He has gone, 'Hey, I am British, they won't hurt me.' But he was a soft target.\" </p> <p>For almost all of his six-month contract with Gulf Supplies and Commercial services, a United Arab Emirates-based general services and construction contractor, Mr Bigley had lived in a house in the affluent Mansur area of Baghdad outside the high-security area known as the Green Zone. </p> <p>He travelled around in a distinctive 4x4 vehicle and chose to have no security guards of his own. His limited hostile-environment training came from his brother, who had also spent many years living in the Middle East. When asked by a neighbour why he had no protection in place, he is reported to have said: \"I'm not afraid. You only die once.\" </p> <p>In its latest report, Centurion, a company that provides training for those travelling and working in danger zones, says of the situation in Iraq: \"Safety for any foreigner in Iraq cannot be guaranteed 100%, with or without security guards ... the majority of foreign workers in Iraq can leave at any time and should not feel forced to work in the country. Most foreign workers in Iraq are attracted by good salaries, a fact which has to be weighed against the good, safe life you could have back home without the fear of kidnapping, injury or death. </p> <p>\"It's their personal decision to work in this dangerous environment _ Training in all aspects regarding these issues should be compulsory. Cost should not be an issue.\" </p> <p><b> Negligent</b><br> </p> <p> Another security guard said companies without the highest security in place were negligent and culpable. </p> <p>\"If it's a Middle Eastern company he was working for, you can forget it; they just don't take security seriously enough. Whether he wanted to live in a house unprotected or not, he shouldn't have been allowed. It is his employer's responsibility to look after his safety as well as his own. It is unbelievably naive,\" he said. </p> <p>But even those with such protection are vulnerable. Last week, a party escorted by a team from Hart Security was attacked while travelling in the British-controlled Amara area. </p> <p>The non-military 4x4 vehicle - known as white fleet - was shot at, with one of the bullets going through the window, hitting the passenger in the head and causing a bloody but superficial injury. </p> <p>As the days go by without news of Mr Bigley, contractors talk of going home not because of his predicament, but simply because the life they lead is tough, hot and mostly boring. They admit, though, that the thought of kidnap isn't too far from their minds, since it is always a consideration of the British soldier that they so heavily rely on for protection. </p> <p>As one private said: \"We have so many things to think about - shooting, improvised explosive devices, mortars, rockets - but we also have to have the idea that we might be taken hostage, and we are always on the lookout for the possibility. </p> <p>\"At the end of the day, everyone here is taking a risk. It's just that the contractors get paid an awful lot of money to do it.\" </p>",
  "The United States is to put the remaining four Britons held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay as suspected terrorists through \"backdoor trials\" within a month, according to US military papers seen by the Guardian. <p>The documents reveal the Britons will be presumed to be enemy combatants by the handpicked US military officers hearing their cases before they start, have limited rights to call witnesses, have no lawyer, and that hearsay evidence can be used against them.</p> <p>The decision comes despite the US agreeing last year with the attorney general Lord Goldsmith that the Britons would not face military commissions. The detainees' lawyers said some of the tribunal's features were even worse than the military commissions, which human rights groups condemned.</p> <p>It represents a second snub by the US to Tony Blair over Guant\u00e1namo, as the prime minister today prepares to address Labour's conference, with the Iraq war and his closeness to George Bush concerns for delegates.</p> <p>In June the Guardian revealed the prime minister had directly asked Mr Bush to return the four Britons, a request that was rejected.</p> <p>The Pentagon documents come from US court hearings where lawyers for the Britons are trying to challenge their detention before civilian courts, a move the Bush administration is resisting.</p> <p>US military documents outline the rules for the combatant status review tribunals, a new process announced by the Pentagon in July after the Supreme Court ruled Guant\u00e1namo Bay was subject to the jurisdiction of US courts.</p> <p>In a letter Thomas Lee, US deputy assistant attorney gen eral, says the tribunals for Britons taking legal action in the US will be completed by mid-October.</p> <p>The documents reveal that prisoners have no right to a lawyer, only to a US military representative, who can inform his superiors of what the prisoner tells him.</p> <p>Furthermore the tribunal will start with the assumption that the US government case against the Britons is correct, the documents reveal: \"There is a rebuttable presumption that the government evidence ... is genuine and accurate.\"</p> <p>The CSRT rules describe the three presiding members of the panel as \"neutral\", despite the fact they are all senior serving US military officers.</p> <p>The documents also reveal that secondhand testimony will be allowed as evidence of guilt: \"The tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence such as would apply in a court of law. Instead the tribunal shall be free to consider any information it deems relevant and helpful ... it may consider hearsay evidence, taking into account the reliability of such evidence in the circumstances.\"</p> <p>Gitanjail Gutierrez, the US lawyer for British prisoners Moazzam Begg and Feroz Abbasi, is in London to press the British government over the tribunals. She will meet Lord Goldsmith and Foreign Office officials tomorrow. Ms Gutierrez said: \"It's as much of a kangaroo court as the military commissions.\"</p> <p>Brent Mickum, the US lawyer for Briton Martin Mubanga, who he will see in Guant\u00e1namo on Wednesday, has told his clients not to take part: \"Findings from the CSRT would be used against my clients at trial. They are backdoor trials. The personal representative is an agent of the government who can be compelled to testify against you at the tribunal and at any subsequent trial.\"</p> <p>Last night a Foreign Office spokeswoman repeated demands for the British detainees to be sent home because they could not get a fair trial at Guant\u00e1namo. She could not say whether Britain had made any protest over the tribunals.</p> <p>Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said: \"What is going on here? Not a squeak, not a complaint by the British government so far as we're aware. Great store was set by the agreement the attorney general apparently reached, but it does not seem to have any effect in preventing these proceedings.\"</p> <p>Captain Becki Brenton, spokesperson at the Pentagon for the CSRT, said: \"It is not a backdoor trial. The CSRT is modelled and built on army regulations, it is very fair. It is a non-adversarial administrative process, established to allow each detainee an opportunity to contest their designation as an enemy combatant.\"</p> <p>Detainees can refuse to take part, but their case would be heard in their absence. Their lawyers say the tribunals were set up by the US military to avoid the cases being heard by civilian courts.</p> <p>If found to be enemy combatants, the Britons could continue to be held without charge or trial.</p> <p>Out of 53 cases decided, only one person, a Pakistani, has been released.</p> <p>Five Britons were released from Guant\u00e1namo in March, alleging they had been beaten and humiliated by their US captors.</p> <p>Four have been held for up to two-and-a-half years without charge or trial.

  "Earlier this year, 15 foetuses were found dumped in a river in Nairobi, Kenya. A night watchman reportedly spotted men unloading black plastic bags from a vehicle into the Ngong river. His discovery sparked a public outcry and helped to reinforce opposition against abortion in the east African country: especially when it was discovered that at least one of the bags contained a foetus that was almost full-term. <p>Kenyan health minister Charity Ngilu says abortion will never be used as a solution to unwanted pregnancy, while the police quickly launched investigations to track down the mothers and offending doctors. Abortion in Kenya is illegal, except if there is a severe threat to the physical and mental health of the mother. It carries a penalty of 14 years in prison for the abortionist and seven for the mother. </p> <p>Despite this harsh law, about 300,000 abortions are carried out every year in Kenya. Many of these are done secretly with a range of instruments including dirty sticks and pieces of metal wire, or by using toxic chemicals and violent massage. These crude interventions cause miscarriage, excessive bleeding, ulceration, infection and, at times, irreparable damage to the woman's health. It is estimated that at least 2,500 women die annually from botched terminations. Statistics also suggest that many Kenyan women would like to use contraceptives but are unable to access them. The situation has been tragically compounded by the US policy on foreign funding - formally called the Mexico City Policy, but dubbed the global gag rule. </p> <p>'The rule was ill advised and its impact is wider than has really been quantified. What I can say for sure is that it's like passing a death sentence on a number of women who otherwise would have been saved,' says Dr Solomon Orero, one of Kenya's most authoritative gynaecologists. He specialises in post-abortion care, harnessing foreign and local funding to develop facilities - particularly in remote, under-serviced areas - for women to receive lifesaving medical care after unsafe abortions. </p> <p>Orero argues that a woman's choice to terminate a pregnancy must be seen in the context of the life she lives. Most Kenyans are poor by western standards and it is a struggle for them to access basic healthcare. Despite a government commitment to family planning, the use of contraception has stagnated in Kenya at 1998 levels, with the average mother bearing five children. </p> <p>'Here is a woman who is illiterate most of the time, who is ignorant most of the time, who has no rights most of the time, who has no opinion most the time,' says Orero. 'What then happens is that woman, who is poor most of the time, will be powerless to do anything about the complications from an unwanted pregnancy.' </p> <p>This category of woman, Orero says, has become a victim of US anti-abortion foreign policy. They are often dependent on family planning organisations, places that have lost funding for refusing to sign the global gag rule. The politics of the richest nation are arbitrarily affecting the lives of those on the poorest continent. </p> <p>Kenya's most prominent family-planning NGO, the Family Planning Association of Kenya (FPAK), for example, is poised to close half of its clinics this year. It has already closed three. If it cannot find more funds, only four will remain by December. 'It has been disastrous for us,' says executive director Godwin Mzenge. 'When the global gag rule took effect, USAID was funding five out of 14 clinics as well as community-based activities and volunteers.' </p> <p>Previously, USAID funding provided training, personnel costs, clinic supplies and overheads. It even helped to fund the purchase of the FPAK head office building. Similarly, Marie Stopes Kenya (MSK), which provides half of all family planning in Kenya, has lost resources. </p> <p>'In this country, 60% of the population are young people moving into their reproductive age,' says Cyprian Awiti, programme director of MSK. 'There is a strong need for reproductive health, family planning, the management of sexually transmitted disease, HIV/Aids treatment and safe motherhood.' </p> <p>As a little boy, Awiti witnessed his mother preparing to give birth to his sister 'between stones' near his village in rural west Kenya. It was the traditional way to give birth. 'When my mother was about to go into labour, she walked out of the house and there were two stones,' he says. 'She supported her back with one stone, and with her legs on the other, she pushed out the child.' </p> <p>In Awiti's lifetime, Kenya has undergone limited modernisation, particularly in urban areas, but the government is still battling to provide health services. From the private sector, Awiti has worked hard to develop a network of Marie Stopes clinics and community programmes to give women like his mother better access to reproductive health services. Now he's up against the global gag rule. </p> <p>'We have lost about 30% of our services as a result,' Awiti says. 'We are not able to reach as many women in the rural areas as we had planned with the funding from the US. We had to close two facilities that were very dear to us.' </p> <p>One of the former Marie Stopes clinics now stands boarded up in a dirty alley in Mathare, Nairobi. Groups of unsupervised children play and scamper nearby in mounds of litter. A 15-year-old among them has a baby tied to her back. </p> <p>'If this clinic was open, she wouldn't have become pregnant,' says Rose Cheche, a volunteer who used to work from the clinic in this community. 'Since it closed, the people have not been happy. Patients who are pregnant have nowhere to go. The place where you can buy the pill is far from here and the transport costs are high.' </p> <p>Josephine Musyoka, a mother of seven, used to go to an FPAK clinic in the slum of Eastleigh. 'Ever since the clinic closed, I have found it difficult to pay for family planning. The transport costs to the government clinic are high. I have also noticed that prices have increased at the new facility, and, as I don't work, I can't afford them,' she says. </p> <p>Musyoka is softly spoken and a little shy. She says that she and her friends do not like going to the government clinic as the officials are insensitive and do not spend time on consultations. But city dwellers like Musyoka are better off than their rural sisters. Such women now have to travel up to 50km from their homes to acquire contraceptives, according to Mzenge. Roads are treacherous and long trips are expensive. Previously, community volunteers formed a network through urban and rural Kenya providing both contraceptives and counselling. Without NGO resources, many are no longer serving women's needs. </p> <p>'The woman loses more than just a packet of pills. In fact, I would say that a packet of pills is an entry point to giving the woman health education on issues of nutrition, breast-feeding, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/Aids,' Mzenge says. He adds that many Kenyans are now interpreting the cutbacks as a sign that family planning is no longer a priority. To start them up again at a later stage would be difficult due to scepticism from disappointed clients. </p> <p>The despair in Kenya is matched by concerns felt by similar organisations in Africa's second most populous country: Ethiopia. Of all Africans, Ethiopians use contraception the least. Ethiopia's health service reaches only half of its people. As in Kenya, abortion is illegal, and the maternal mortality rate is alarmingly high at 871 deaths for every 100,000 births. </p> <p>'According to some studies, 54% of these deaths are the result of unsafe abortion,' says Getachew Bekele, programme director of Marie Stopes International Ethiopia (MSIE). </p> <p>MSIE has had to reduce its community-based programmes and has already closed down three health posts that distributed contraceptives to communities. As in Kenya, many people now have to travel long distances for these services. </p> <p>'When we were told to sign the agreement of the Mexico City Policy, it was not an easy decision,' says Amare Bedada, executive director of the Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia (FGAE), the country's largest family planning organisation. 'It was a big dilemma for us. 'The FGAE is committed to advocating safe abortion and felt it could not betray its principles. 'In addition to this, we are working with youth and we cannot refuse counselling or be unsympathetic to somebody with a problem.' </p> <p>As a consequence of its decision, USAID withdrew support for the FGAE, which then lost almost 35% of its external funds. The FGAE built up its services and networks over four decades, but was suddenly forced to cancel numerous outreach programmes, reduce the number of volunteers from 1,000 to 90 and cut its staff. </p> <p>Ude is one of the small rural villages losing out as a result of the funding crisis. It is a two-hour drive south of the capital, Addis Ababa. Most people in Ude travel on foot or by donkey cart. Defaru Jima, a local farmer, is the volunteer responsible for contraception in the village. FGAE gave him a multicoloured bicycle on which to do his rounds to distribute pills and information. His health post is a mudwalled hut that is almost completely bare save for some faded posters offering graphic warnings against unsafe abortion, advice to new mothers and displaying contraceptive pill samples. Jima says he opens the post twice a week, but he looks dispirited. His stipend has been cut and there have been no refresher courses. </p> <p>'One of the CBD nurses has been laid off, and I have not received my uniform, which is important for my identity as a volunteer,' Jima says. He has complained to the nearest FGAE branch in Nazareth, a bustling commercial centre. Mohammed Yimer, the head of planning at the clinic, is trying to stretch his reduced budget to meet the needs of the community. Five senior members of staff have been retrenched, including the laboratory technician and a senior nurse. </p> <p> 'The funding was substantially withdrawn due to the global gag rule. We are in a serious and critical period,' Yimer explains. 'Almost 20% of our budget was from that source. We have been forced to reduce our staff. People don't believe us any more. They were expecting us - requesting us - to expand the services to create more access for other rural areas, but, instead, we have stopped some activities, training for volunteers and the provision of uniforms and other supplies. The overall programme was totally paralysed for a time.' </p> <p> As Yimer leaves for a field visit, he shows us a waiting room filled with young women, many of whom are pregnant. The rape and abduction of young girls is common in Ethiopia. Unmarried pregnant girls are disowned by their communities, such is the shame, and forced into domestic work or prostitution. Traditional attitudes to women can be inflexible. Many families practise female genital mutilation as a rite of passage for young girls. </p> <p> It is estimated that 36% of married Ethiopian women cannot obtain contraceptives when they want them. The NGO community promotes reproductive rights for women, but it has yet to overcome resistance from traditional and religious leaders within this comparatively conservative society. The legalisation of abortion is one of the most contested issues in Ethiopia. </p> <p> 'The gag rule is having a chilling effect on this heated debate,' says Bedada. 'People cite the example of the US policy and raise the question that if the US - a country that has extensive experience in making abortion legal - recoils, it is certain that many people will consider abortion inappropriate.' </p> <p> 'The latest policy of the US has stopped some of the most innovative programmes in this country,' says Sahlu Haile, the senior programme adviser of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. 'It takes several years or decades to develop reproductive health programmes, but only a single day to destroy them.' </p> <p> The foundation stepped in to temper some of the losses of affected organisations. However, Haile estimates that the funds provided by donors fall short of the $100m a year Ethiopia needs for family planning. He worries about the shortages of contraceptive supplies. </p> <p> 'It's a serious problem, because if the family planning organisation runs out of contraceptives for three months, it is dead. There are no alternatives for a rural woman: if she does not get contraception, she'll become pregnant. It is criminal to start something you can't continue.' </p> <p> Many African governments rely heavily on international donors to provide family planning commodities: stocks of contraceptive pills, injections and condoms. Recently, supplies have been erratic, leading to sporadic shortages, which has demoralised family planning organisations. Haile is critical of the Ethiopian government for its half-hearted commitment in delivering contraception and for not resolving the population crisis, which he says worsens poverty. </p> <p> The head of the Ethiopian National Population Office, Hiruy Mitiku, blames 'petty operational problems' for the breakdown in the distribution of contraceptives. He says the government has failed to create an effective healthcare system. Ethiopia has set challenging goals for itself: reducing the maternal mortality rate by half by 2015, and bringing down the fertility rate so the average Ethiopian woman has four children instead of eight. But these targets are unlikely to be met. </p> <p> 'The rapid population growth is eating up our development efforts in this country and frustrating the whole thing,' Mitiku says. He agrees that the re-instatement of the Mexico City policy was a blow to the government. 'It has affected us quite a lot. The NGOs were trying to penetrate deep into the rural areas and support our service,' he says. </p> <p> The family planning associations have also been hit by an unexpected problem. The focus on HIV/Aids has meant that international funding is diverted to what is perceived as a more urgent global crisis, and they say reproductive health is taking a back seat. Internationally and domestically, there is insufficient political will and money to make up the shortfall. </p> <p> 'Our government is always broke, so we could not turn to it and say, \"Could you extend a helping hand here?\"' says Mzenge. </p> <p> The head of the Kenyan Population Services, Doctor Richard Muga, admits there is not enough money to meet the reproductive health needs of Kenyan women. But he is loath to say who is to blame. </p> <p> 'When these resources don't come, it is a nightmare for the people of Kenya, 'Muga says. 'A message should go out there that sub-Saharan Africa - Kenya included - still needs this support. So out there, anybody who cares, they need to hear.'</p>",
  "<p>Many high street shops and businesses still provide poor access for disabled people despite new anti-discrimination legislation coming into force this week, according to research published today.</p> <p>A poll by the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) found that most shops, cafes, restaurants, cinemas and pubs had yet to comply with new laws to improve access for disabled people, which come into force on Friday.</p> <p>Under part three of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, every business in Britain will need to become more user-friendly for the country's 10 million disabled people. This means they must address the problems their buildings cause for disabled people, such as steps, heavy doors and bad lighting. Failure to act could result in legal action.</p> <p>But the DRC found that disabled people encountered major problems getting into high street services in four out of five city centres due to steps, heavy doors, narrow entrances and bad layout inside stores. Not one disabled shopper involved in the survey enjoyed hassle-free shopping, according to the commission. </p> <p>The report's findings included:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nearly a quarter of all the 88 major high street outlets surveyed were rated as poor or very poor by disabled shoppers</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> One fifth of the disabled shoppers said they would not go back to the high street they visited</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Problems with getting in and around high street stores added an extra two hours to disabled people's shopping trips</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> One third of public toilets were difficult or impossible to access</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Four out of five disabled people encountered serious problems with cinema access. In three locations they could not get in at all.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Four out of five disabled people encountered problems with lack of space between tables in restaurants, cafes and pubs.</p> <p>Bert Massie, chairman of the DRC, said the new legislation would mean that disabled people no longer had to put up with a second class service.</p> <p>He said: \"Whilst it's clear that some shops and services are getting it right for the disabled consumer there are those that have done little or nothing to prepare for the legislation. For them there will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide as disabled people's complaints will now be backed by law.\"</p>",
  "The government is preparing selective restrictions on smoking in public places that are likely to disappoint the medical profession and public health campaigners by failing to stop people lighting up in pubs and clubs. <p>A white paper - due in mid October - is also expected to propose a new system of labelling to identify good and bad foods. </p> <p>It will follow the lead of public opinion by demanding restrictions on smoking at work and in restaurants. </p> <p>But ministers think the British public is not yet ready to follow the example of Ireland, which has secured widespread compliance with legislation banning smoking in pubs. </p> <p>Tony Blair is understood to have withdrawn his earlier preference for legislation to allow local authorities to introduce local smoking bans. Although this would have allowed the government to pass the buck to councillors, it might not have tackled public health issues in areas of heavy smoking that might need the ban most. </p> <p>John Reid, the health secretary, has also backed away from his original principled objection to smoking bans. His starting point was that people had to take hard choices for themselves and should not be dragooned by politicians. </p> <p>During the summer he angered doctors by appearing to suggest at a Labour party \"big conversation\" event that cigarettes might provide the only pleasure to a young mother on a sink estate and it was inappropriate for middle-class professionals to lecture her. </p> <p>But last week he told pro- and anti-smoking groups that the status quo on tobacco legislation was no longer an option. On Sunday he told a fringe meeting at the Labour conference in Brighton: \"People exercise free will, but not in circumstances of their own choosing. So there is a role for governments. It is not just a matter of telling people it is their responsibility.\" </p> <p>The white paper is still being argued over between ministers who want to find a way between the two extremes. </p> <p>They know that whatever they do they will be accused by libertarians of engineering a \"nanny state\" measure and by the powerful anti-smoking lobby of failing to do enough about public health. </p> <p>The result is likely to be a pick and mix white paper with different solutions in different types of public place and different timetables for securing 100% elimination of smoking. The public may have a choice of smoking and non-smoking pubs for some years to come. </p> <p>Mr Reid told the Guardian that he has given careful consideration to research on public attitudes to smoking published by the Office for National Statistics in July. </p> <p>The ONS found that 86% of adults in Britain wanted to restrict smoking at work, 87% in restaurants, 85% in indoor shopping centres, 91% in indoor sports and leisure centres, 78% in indoor areas at railway and bus stations and 90% in other public areas such as banks and post offices. A smaller majority - 56% -wanted to restrict smoking in pubs, but only 20% said there should be an outright ban. </p> <p>The white paper is also expected to back a system of labelling foods according to their relative healthiness. But a ban on the advertising of less healthy products does not look likely at this stage. </p> <p>The food industry launched its own Manifesto for Food and Health yesterday in a bid to stave off tighter regulation. The Food and Drink Federation made seven broad commitments which \"individual member companies will deliver in varying ways\", it said. </p> <p>These cover labelling, portion sizes, product formulations, vending machine advertising and public education. Some of the commitments make new concessions to campaigners' concerns, such as the announcement by some manufacturers that they will end supersizing and will reduce salt, sugar and fat. </p> <p>Cadbury and McDonald's have said they will phase out supersizing next year.

  "<p>Many people will have fond memories of educational trips they enjoyed in their school days. Visits to outdoor education centres, for example, give pupils new and exciting opportunities to take part in adventurous activities, and it can often be their first time away from home without their parents. But the benefits of such trips - and the fond memories - are under threat because of teachers' fears that they will be sued by anxious parents if things don't go entirely to plan.</p> <p>As chief inspector of schools, I am today launching a new report that examines these benefits. Outdoor Education: Aspects of Good Practice focuses primarily on outdoor centres, which provide activities such as rock climbing and canoeing, but also looks at the outdoor activities pupils take part in at school.</p> <p>Ofsted inspectors found that pupils benefit from outdoor education in many ways. Such activities give pupils the opportunity to develop physical skills in challenging situations and to nurture important social skills, such as teamwork and leadership. Pupils visiting outdoor centres get to take on important responsibilities in unfamiliar locations. Pitching a tent, cooking a meal and navigating a mountain walk are new experiences for many pupils. These activities can help to contribute towards their personal and social development.</p> <p>But it would appear that these benefits are under threat. Our report indicates that there has been some decline in outdoor opportunities for pupils, and that one reason for this is teachers' fears of litigation should an accident occur.</p> <p>This fear is leading some less experienced teachers to offer less challenging outdoor activities in schools. Over the past decade, inspectors have noticed a marked narrowing of the curriculum in outdoor education as some teachers shy away from certain activities. One teaching union, the NASUWT, is even advising its members not to take part in outdoor activities because of the risk of litigation should an accident occur.</p> <p>I think it would be a great tragedy if the tremendous opportunities offered by outdoor education became lost to all but a minority of pupils because teachers were concerned about their legal position.</p> <p>I sympathise with teachers who have these fears. But I believe this position is seriously mistaken, and I have a real concern that children might miss out as a result. The benefits of outdoor education are far too important to forfeit, and by far outweigh the risks of an accident occurring.</p> <p>Recent evidence suggests that the number of accident claims, including personal injury claims, is going down. Clearly, more needs to be done to tackle teachers' perceptions of the risk of litigation should an accident occur. This fear is often due to a lack of awareness and confidence among school teachers about the procedures for managing risk, as well as insecurities about subject knowledge. Staff at outdoor centres, on the other hand, are well versed in risk assessment and management. They are highly qualified specialists, and will teach only the activities they are trained in. They are usually more up-to-date with the law and procedures for managing risk.</p> <p>One of the best ways to help children to learn about risk is to teach them how to deal with difficult and tricky situations by allowing them to experience them in controlled conditions. Removing risk is not the answer. Life is not risk-free. Risk needs to be part of a child's education.</p> <p>We all have a part to play in ensuring that pupils do not lose out. Outdoor education centres and specialists need to be invited to share their expertise in risk management with schools.</p> <p>Teachers need training to recognise the benefits of outdoor education and to understand the risks involved and the law surrounding it. This will give teachers the confidence to offer pupils more challenging activities within the curriculum and take pupils on trips.</p> <p>We need to ensure that teachers are qualified to manage risks, rather than being put off by what they see as the dire paraphernalia of risk-management, including endless form-filling.</p> <p>Just as important is the need for parents to trust teachers, schools and outdoor centres. Parents have to accept that if their children take part in outdoor activities, there is always going to be some element of risk.</p> <p>I understand that it will always be difficult for parents to place responsibility for their child's wellbeing in the hands of others. But parents should trust the teacher's professional judgment. They must remember that the overwhelming majority of school trips pass without any accidents, serious or minor.</p> <p>Finally, I think all of us - society in general - must accept that life, especially outdoor and adventurous activities, can never be totally risk-free. We must all be less keen to look for someone to blame if something goes wrong.</p> <p>I am not advocating that teachers be absolved of all responsibility. In those rare cases when accidents happen, it is entirely legitimate and necessary to ask why they happened.</p> <p>There are guidelines of recognised good practice to help teachers. These include following recognised safety procedures and ensuring that risk assessment and pupils' capabilities guide teachers' planning. If these procedures are followed and an accident occurs, they provide a secure base for teachers on which to refute negligence.</p> <p>We must all act now to quell teachers' fears about litigation. If we don't, fewer and fewer pupils will experience the benefits of outdoor education in residential centres and in schools.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>David Bell is chief inspector of schools</p>",

  "Record producer Phil Spector pleaded not guilty to murder yesterday and lambasted prosecutors as \"Hitler-like\" after he was indicted in connection with the death of an actor in his home last year. <p>Spector showed no emotion in court as he heard the charge over the murder of Lana Clarkson, 40, who was found shot dead in his home in California. </p> <p>But outside court afterwards, Spector said: \"The actions of the Hitler-like DA and his storm-trooper henchmen are reprehensible, unconscionable and despicable.\" </p> <p>He was allowed to remain free on $1m (\u00a3550,000) bail. The trial is due to start on December 16 in Los Angeles. </p> <p>Ms Clarkson was found dead in the foyer of Spector's 33-room mansion on the night of February 3 2003. Spector, 64, famed for creating the \"wall of sound\" in the 1960s and for his work with the Beatles and other artists, had met the actor that night at the House of Blues restaurant in Los Angeles, where she worked as a hostess. </p> <p>An autopsy showed that Ms Clarkson died from a single gunshot wound from a weapon put in her mouth. </p> <p>Spector has claimed that Ms Clarkson killed herself, but police claim they found blood and gunshot residue on Spector, as well as evidence that he had cleaned and moved the gun. </p> <p>Spector had already been charged with murder by the Los Angeles district attorney's office. The move to a grand jury indictment was intended to speed up the process - prosecutors have made no secret of their frustration with Spector's frequent changes of legal team, which they see as a delaying tactic - and to ensure that evidence accumulated in the investigation can stay secret until the trial. </p> <p>Spector told reporters outside court: \"No crime was committed in my home.\" He also insisted that he did not own the gun. </p> <p>But prosecutors allege that the nature of the injury means it was unlikely to have been self-inflicted. </p> <p>Officers who arrived at the scene of the shooting found Spector standing in the doorway of the home with his hands in his pockets. </p> <p>They found the body of Ms Clarkson slumped in a chair, and in another room found a man's coat with bloodstains on the arm. </p> <p>They also found evidence that the two had been drinking, contradicting Spector's assertion that he was not drinking at the time of the incident. </p> <p>In an interview with Esquire magazine, Spector said Ms Clarkson had come to his house to commit suicide and had \"kissed the gun\" in a bizarre ritual.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong> delighted fans last night by attending her first London premiere since the birth of her baby. </p> <p> The star had said that she was putting her career on the back burner to focus on daughter <strong>Apple</strong>, born in May. Last night, she told the waiting media throng, at the premiere of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, that she was enjoying motherhood: \"I'm spending as much time as possible with Apple, carrying her around, singing to her: all kinds of things.\" </p> <p> She was joined by co-star <strong>Jude Law</strong>, whose ex-wife <strong>Sadie Frost</strong> was also present at the event in London's Leicester Square. </p> <p> In the \u00a338m film, Paltrow plays an intrepid reporter who joins forces with her ex-boyfriend to save the world from a mad scientist and his giant robots. </p> <p> Set in 1930s New York, the fantasy adventure was made without sets or location. Actors were filmed in front of a blue screen and the background was added later using computer graphics. \"It's a difficult technique, but it was actually fun. You've just got to use your imagination,\" Paltrow told reporters. </p> <p> The film opens in the UK on October 1.</p>",
  "<b> What's Plan B?</b> <br> <p>The man behind Labour's campaign strategy was a tall, angular MP called Fraser Kemp. Kemp had seldom been seen in public with his candidate, and carried the conspiratorial authority of an old party insider. Allegations of dirty tricks raised only a placid smile.</p> <p>\"When you put down your address on the nomination paper as the Hartlepool marina, after you've given an interview saying 'I love living in Gainford,' - well that's a legitimate thing to target. That's not dirty tricks, that's not personal. That's a question of character.\" He shook his head, as if sorrowful at the Lib Dem's folly.</p> <p>\"[Lord] Rennard and the Lib Dems, they had a really amazing byelection team in the 90s. But I don't see it now; they've lost it. They've had the sword of Damocles hanging over that hospital; they're desperate to see that hospital close. But it isn't happening, and now they haven't got a back up plan. They haven't got a plan B.</p> <p>\"You need to be here 24 hours a day, living it, breathing it. Rennard says he's up here but he isn't; I know he got the 2.30 train yesterday, I saw him at Darlington, and today he's off again. And I know he was in Westminster last week because someone saw him in the Pugin room.\"</p> <p>You have to define your issues, Kemp said, and make them work for you. The hospital had failed for the Lib Dems because it lay beyond their control. What was Iain Wright's defining issue? \"He's a local boy.\"</p> <p>Possibly to prove this, I was allowed to accompany Wright - a season-ticket holder - to Hartlepool United's next home game. An elderly man approached as soon as we reached the terraces. \"You'll win, lad,\" he nodded. 'Cause you're from the town; you know the town - and you're Labour, of course.\" Wright beamed. With victory seeming to beckon, Labour were warming in the glow.</p> <p>The temperature drop in the Lib Dem HQ was palpable. Dunn looked rattled, distracted, and Lord Rennard was indeed absent. Fordham struggled to string together good news; Dunn's name recognition was high, people still liked her, it was clear the Tories couldn't win. Rennard would soon be back; the blog would continue. The team had decided not to \"dignify\" Labour's attacks with a response; \"When there's a personal attack, if it hurts, well it's true. You hold your nerve.\" He looked tense.</p> <p>Plan B was to be the same as plan A; it was still the hospital, stupid. If there had never been any intention to close it, as Blair claimed, then why had 33,000 people had to sign a petition? Dr Evan Harris MP was drafted in from Oxford, and poured over NHS documents hunting out other Labour hospital lies.</p> <p>What about the problem of geography? For once, Fordham snapped. \"Look, Jody's been here 10 weeks. How many towns have had MPs born and bred? Hell-lo?\"</p> <p>A giant poster in the Lib Dem HQ window continued its countdown to the byelection: 13 Days To Save The Hospital. But that afternoon, the Hartlepool Mail carried a photograph of John Reid signing the Save Our Hospital petition. Wright stood behind him, smiling straight into the camera, like a man who was seeing the ink dry on his new contract of employment.</p> <p><b> Kilroy is here!</b><br></p> <p>This is what a byelection looks like on a Saturday morning. Outside the main shopping centre, about 70 Ukip supporters had been bussed in from all over Britain - farming folk mainly, it seemed, who had dressed as if for market day. Over their tweeds they wore bright neon bibs - \"We want our country back\" - and they clutched purple and yellow balloons.</p> <p>The men in dark suits and union flag ties were from a party called the English Democrats. They had brought along a coffin. From down the street marched a troop of overweight men in superman outfits, purple capes and horns, handing hand out Fathers4Justice leaflets. Respect had a stall and a megaphone. An evangelical Teeside church set up a PA system, and pulled out their guitars.</p> <p>\"Jesus Christ healed my body. He healed me from drug addiction. . .\"</p> <p>\"Tuition fees: the Scottish don't pay. Why not? Because you're paying for it! English taxes for English people!\"</p> <p>A rustle stirred through the crowd. \"He's here!\" \"There he is!\" \"He's here?\" \"There!\" Women and children jostled, clambering on benches to see.</p> <p>\"When Beckham missed that penalty. . .\"</p> <p>\"If you're sick of Tony Blair's lies. . .\"</p> <p>\"I were paralytic New Year's Eve, help me God . . .\"</p> <p>Shoppers emerged through the scrum, blinking, stunned. A TV camera pushed through the crowd; photographers jostled. \"Here, just watch this pram a minute.\" \"Go on, shove your way in.\"</p> <p>\"I want to give you more holidays! I want to give you more money! And save your hospital!\"</p> <p>\"Kilroy is here! Kilroy is HERE! KIL-ROY!!\"</p> <p>Out of a purple Ukip van stepped the silvery Robert Kilroy-Silk. A woman rushed to kiss him. Sunshine broke through the cloud, and shone down on a carnival of democracy.</p> <p><b> The balloons are getting bigger</b><br></p> <p>Why does anyone choose to get involved? Fourteen candidates are standing in Hartlepool - some for parties that will spend \u00a3100,000 here, others for parties you have never heard of. Hundreds of activists are working 18-hour days, sleeping on local members' floors, surviving on coffee. They absorb Hartlepool's yawning skies and low horizons, its autumn wind and whining seagulls, the minutiae of its preoccupations. And come Friday, most of them will go home disappointed.</p> <p>They describe it as an obsession, an addiction; their party is their \"family\". Previous byelections are carried like the memories of ex-girlfriends - some to be treasured, others avenged - and every campaigner clings to their favourite, able to recall the exact percentage swing of a 30-year-old victory, right down to the decimal point. By the halfway point of the Hartlepool campaign, each party's strategists had formulated a version of how this one could still be won.</p> <p>For the Tories to escape catastrophe, they had to convince their supporters that a vote for Middleton wasn't a waste. It was a feasible ambition, for local Tory voters are largely unfamiliar with tactical voting. As Kemp put it, \"If you're going to be a Tory here, you might as well be proud of it, 'cause you ain't going to win anything.\" To this end, the Tory campaign settled on crime as its big campaign issue.</p> <p>It wasn't a bad idea, for crime strikes a real chord in Hartlepool, and Middleton has a touch of John Major - a decent man, clearly clever. But out canvassing, his conversation often sounded like a business pitch to an investment bank, and matters weren't helped by his height. He had a tendency to talk down to voters, his nerves translating as impatience. The primitive challenge of asking poor, uneducated, elderly people for their support seemed to defeat him.</p> <p>\"What if I told you,\" he threw at them. \"That I had a plan to take every single hard drug user off the streets of Hartlepool. Would that make a difference?\" They nodded politely, and looked utterly perplexed. Fortunately for Middleton, few pressed him to explain how this policy would work, for when I did he soon unravelled on the detail. The more serious problem was that they did not appear to take it seriously.</p> <p>The challenge for Ukip was to drag the campaign off local issues into a wider debate that might contain Europe. \"We're not electing some kind of super-councillor,\" Allison kept sensibly trying to point out. His press man, Clive Page, was losing patience: \"The hospital's going to close; No it isn't!' 'I come from Hartlepool; No you don't.' Jesus, I've seen married couples have better arguments. We're going to send someone to Westminster on the basis of this?\" He threw up his hands. \"When is this campaign going to grow up?\"</p> <p>The point was legitimate, but the Ukip campaign wasn't so grown up itself. A Kilroy meeting in the Town Hall Theatre failed to draw more than a dozen or so non-party members, and the team's improbable trio of personalities was clashing. \"Piers Merchant won't tell me what's going on,\" Page grumbled. He would cheer himself up by telling funny stories; Steve Harris would roll his eyes, pulling faces behind Page's back. And the party seemed to be growing obsessed with balloons. Every day, they got bigger and bigger. \"When this is all over,\" Harris growled, wrestling with a 20ft purple and yellow inflatable. \"I'll have spent more man hours on these goddamn balloons than any other damn thing.\"</p> <p>The Respect campaign preferred to rely on leaflets and moral authority. In danger of losing both the anti-war and hospital vote to the Lib Dems, their greatest hope lay in helping Labour discredit Dunn, then offering Bloom as the only left-of-centre alternative to Wright. Once again, though, the problem was Bloom's integrity. If anyone could win the local hero contest it was him, but his distaste for smear tactics left him floored.</p> <p>Such qualms did not trouble Labour. Wright was dispatched from HQ every morning to repeat the same message: \"I'm a local boy, and proud of Hartlepool.\" Out canvassing he had a lively, unaffected intimacy on the doorstep, and it appeared to be working. \"You're one of us, aren't you, lad?\" voters would smile. \"Not like that barrister.\"</p> <p>Did voters ever bring up Iraq, I asked?</p> <p>\"I've met more than 4,000 people by now, and do you know?\" Wright said. \"Only two have even mentioned it. It's local issues people care about; that's why they want a local candidate.\" Not five minutes later we met a man who had voted Labour all his life, but wouldn't this time because of the war. \"What an amazing co-incidence,\" Wright marvelled afterwards. \"He was the third.\" The Labour candidate's faithfulness to the message was becoming unnerving; whatever the question, the answer was the same - \"I'm local, and proud of it.\"</p> <p>Ministerial visits came almost daily; John Prescott, David Blunkett, Charles Clarke, Patricia Hewitt all passed through. One conspicuous omission, however, was Tony Blair - and it is hard not to conclude that this was deliberate. Hartlepool is not a New Labour town. The war is not popular here, and the Wright team's eagerness to localise the campaign was in part in a tactic to defuse disenchantment with the government. \"You're not voting for Blair,\" Wright would say on the doorstep. \"You're voting for me.\"</p> <p>Yet gradually, before everyone's eyes, the town was turning orange. More and more Jody Dunn posters were appearing in Labour strongholds, eclipsing the spots of red in windows. The Lib Dems had simply refused to believe the NOP poll, and had marshalled an army of activists from accross the country. Every morning before 9am, between 10 and 50 activists would appear clutching bacon sandwiches and coffee, ready for work, most of them under 30 and many from hundreds of miles away. Mattresses and sleeping bags crowded the attic room. Some brought their dogs along - a black Labrador had campaigned in Leicester South - and badges on the front desk read: \"I was at the Hartlepoolby-election\". Long after midnight, the office still buzzed, as printing machines hummed through the night.</p> <p>The message was a shrewd conflation of disaffection with Blair, and concern for the hospital. Labour can't be trusted on the hospital, their leaflets insisted; Blair has lied before, and he's lying again. The canvassing line never wavered; if you're fed up with Labour, Jody Dunn is your first chance in 40 years for a change . . .</p> <p><b> The hospital is safe . . . no it isn't</b><br></p> <p>The Lib Dem printers hummed through the night: Labour can't be trusted on the hospital, the Lib Dem leaflets insisted; Blair has lied before, and he's lying again. Their message never wavered; if you're fed up with Labour, Jody Dunn is your first chance in 40 years for a change.</p> <p>On the doorstep, she charmed and dazzled: \"Give me a chance. If I'm rubbish, you can get rid of me at the general election next May. Just try me out.\" A woman opened one door and began screaming: \"You've got a cheek coming here! I heard what you said about people in Hartlepool!\" She jabbed a finger hysterically. \"How dare you?\" Ten minutes later, Dunn walked away, and a Lib Dem poster went up in the window.</p> <p>With a little over a week to go, the five candidates assembled for the first public hustings. It was a raucous, smoky debate held in the Corporation Club, organised by the Save Our Hospital Campaign. Iain Wright was never going to do well here; his claim that the hospital was safe was scorned by all four rivals, and the mood was predatory. But Wright made two astonishing errors.</p> <p>Why, someone asked from the floor, had a planning application been made to sell off part of the hospital's land? \"It hasn't,\" Wright flatly denied. Jody Dunn calmly held up a copy of the planning application; Bloom asked how Wright, as a council cabinet minister, could conceivably never have seen it. Then Wright was asked exactly when he had signed the Save Our Hospital petition, because nobody could find his name on it. \"It was in March,\" he said firmly. How was that possible, demanded the questioner, when the petition formally closed last Christmas? \"I - I,\" Wright stammered. \"I can't remember.\"</p> <p>The meeting dissolved in uproar. Wright, visibly shaken, was swept away by a stony entourage. A local Labour member gazed in sorrow. \"The man was a disaster. If that had been a swimming pool he'd have drowned, he was that far out of his depth.\" No one doubted they had witnessed the byelection's defining moment.</p> <p>The following morning, the Hartlepool Mail ran a brief report of the meeting. It made no mention of Wright's self-annihilation, preferring instead to reiterate Blair's pledge that the Hartlepool hospital was safe.</p> <p><b> I'm local you know</b><br></p> <p>A byelection would be incomplete without a conspiracy theory, and all sorts of rumours circulated have been circulating about the Hartlepool Mail in the final week. The previous editor of the paper was sacked last year, following repeated complaints to senior executives from Mandelson. The new editor claimed he had merely printed the story his reporter returned from the hustings meeting with. Mysteriously, though, the report had been absent from the first edition. The editor blamed \"production problems\", but bitter suspicion of a Mandelsonian intervention has not abated.</p> <p>It may have been this which persuaded local Labour members to break their silence about Wright in the closing days of the campaign. Not only are many not campaigning for him. They will not even vote for him, and are plotting to deselect him before the next general election.</p> <p>\"I predict,\" said Keith Fisher, a member of 30 years, \"that regardless of how this Thursday's election goes, there will be a new candidate standing here for Labour in the general election.\"</p> <p>The anger dates back to the candidate selection process in August. Members were given 24 hours to submit nominations by email. Twentysix were submitted, including several long-serving councillors, Mandelson's old election agent, and a former MEP. The NEC vetted them, and presented the local party with a shortlist of three. Wright was the only Hartlepool name on it. \"Local, long-standing members, not even allowed to stand before their own local party? Judged unsuitable even to look at! How can that be? It was shocking - a disgrace,\" Fisher said. \"We were given a choice of one. We felt railroaded into it, and we're seething. I can only assume the NEC had an image of what they wanted, someone who'd say yes to everything and wouldn't rock the boat. And that's Iain Wright for sure. He's a lightweight.\"</p> <p>One of the rejected nominees, a Labour councillor called Robbie Payne, told me had offered to bet another member \u00a31,000 that he could put the name of the winning candidate an envelope, before the entire selection process had begun. \"It's hard to say anything about it without people thinking it's just sour grapes, but the truth is Iain's exactly what New Labour want,\" he sighed. \"A typical puppet, so they can pull his strings. He's got no politics; he doesn't believe in anything.\" Others were praying\" he would lose. Their anger had been stoked by an offer Wright's team had made last month to the local mayor, an independent. In return for the mayor's endorsement, Labour would stand a weak candidate against him at the next mayoral election. The mayor has declined to endorse anyone.</p> <p>Labour won't allow me into their HQ, according to angry members, because the office has had to employ hired hands to stuff envelopes and carry out deliveries. Come the general election, when the budget for this is no longer available, Labour will need the support the local members currently boycotting Wright's campaign - and this will trigger Wright's deselection. \"If he's really the right candidate for us, well then he'll win selection again, won't he?\" shrugged Cllr Payne. Fisher said he \"measured\" Wright by the manner of his selection. But the NEC's decisions were not the candidate's, and there is a danger that with Wright so tightly chaperoned, the vacuum has been filled with unjust speculation. Wright has been a councillor for three years, so has his own record to stand on. Supposing he were elected on Thursday, I asked him what he thought he would be remembered for on the council.</p> <p>\"I think I'd say, being courteous and responsive to local issues. I've tried to be as local a councillor as possible.\"</p> <p>But apart from being local, what else did he offer? The question seemed to throw him. \"Well, I'm local-\"</p> <p>But so was the taxi driver outside - and many of the names rejected by the NEC. If he excluded being local, could he describe his other qualities?</p> <p>\"Well you see I don't think you can exclude it. You see, I'll live in the town.\" But Blair is seldom in Sedgefield, and presumably he didn't think the prime minister ought not be its MP. He looked blank.</p> <p>\"I think I'm bright.\" He paused. \"I think I'm articulate. I've been to university. I can string a sentence together.\" Then he relapsed. \"I think it's absolutely fantastic that one of our own could be going to parliament on Thursday.\"</p> <p>Could he name a single Labour party policy he would be willing to argue against in parliament? \"That's a difficult one.\" He thought about it. \"I would say on a whole range of issues, like the economy, like education, like foreign policy, the Labour government is moving in the right direction.\"</p> <p><b>Campaigning with crosswords</b></p> <p>Hartlepool has been a peculiarly local election, fought not just over local issues, but the very issue of localness. Only Respect and Ukip have expressed any serious ideological commitment, and neither will be sending an MP to Westminster on Friday. The absence of what could be called politics is not exclusive to Labour, though.</p> <p>When I asked Dunn why she was a Liberal Democrat, she said, \"I just feel comfortable with Lib Dems. If I'm in a room with Lib Dems I feel comfortable with them.\" Her position on policy was opaque. \"Well, if you want to go leftwing, rightwing, I've always been more leftwing, I suppose you'd say. But I would say there's a fairness in the Liberal Democrats; there's a respect for difference, and individuals. And that's a very important ethos for me.\"</p> <p>The Lib Dem campaign has concerned itself far more with electoral innovation than policy detail. In the final weekend, it issued the first ever election leaflet to be designed as a glossy women's magazine. Talk of the Town features horoscopes, a crossword and an interview with Claire Rayner, and looks like Take A Break. The Lib Dem's inventiveness extends to the ballot paper itself: each party is allowed six words adjacent to the candidate's name and Lord Rennard has arranged for theirs to read: \"Liberal Democrats - To Save Hartlepool Hospital.\"</p> <p>But they may place too much faith in their famously clever byelection machine. Since Dunn gave a speech last week to party conference, more than 200 activists have poured into Hartlepool, working round the clock to pull off another Brent East or Leicester South. The campaign seems deaf to local irritation. Letters in the Hartlepool Mail complain wearily of overload, but still the party printing machines turn.</p> <p>Hartlepool's windows are blushing bright orange, but Labour may have played a canny game by allowing the Lib Dems to win the poster war, creating an impression of disadvantage to persuade their supporters to bother voting. Their final leaflet reproduces one more time Dunn's blog \"slur\" on the town. \"B****Y CHEEK!\" it screams. If Labour win on Thursday, it will be some time before candidate blogging takes off.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1314105,00.html\">Read part one here</a></p>",
  "Hartlepool's hospital stands in the elbow of two arterial roads just north of the town centre. It was built in 1972, a model of the architectural fashion of the time for custard and chocolate-coloured cladding, and has 334 beds. Over the years, services have steadily expanded, earning the hospital a three-star NHS rating. You would have to search hard in the town to hear a bad word said about it. <p>In 2003, it emerged that health service managers had drawn up a plan to close the hospital. Local protests were mobilised, and the usual complicated round of strategic health reviews, meetings and reports ensued. For 18 months the saga rumbled on, of urgent local concern but little interest nationally, and it would doubtless have continued to do so had the job of Britain's new EU commissioner not been awarded in July to Peter Mandelson. This little hospital in the north east of England now holds the key to British politics. </p> <p>Whichever party wins the battle of Hartlepool hospital will win the byelection - almost certainly the last before the next general election, and therefore the crucible of all Westminster's hopes and fears. Tony Blair is defending not only a 14,571 majority, but the outgoing reputation of New Labour's chief architect. To lose a heartland seat Labour has held since 1964 would be an unthinkable humiliation. For Charles Kennedy, his repositioning as chief contender to Labour will either be vindicated here, or exposed as fantasy. Victories in Leicester South and Brent East have raised hopes, but unless the Liberal Democrats come, at the very least close, talk of a breakthrough next year will ring hollow. </p> <p>The Conservatives finished second here in 2001. Two leaders later, even that lies beyond the hopes of all but the party's wildest optimists, but if they cannot hold on to third, Michael Howard will be facing a mutinous conference, and a crisis that could spiral beyond his control. At stake here for Ukip is the significance of their surprise success in June's elections. If they beat the Tories, they will authenticate their June result, and secure transition from political wild card to serious party. But if they fail, June will be rewritten as a fluke, and their general election prospects downgraded to obscurity. </p> <p>Hartlepool is an idiosyncratic stage for such a battle. The town echoes much of post-industrial north east history; catastrophe in the 80s, followed by painful reinvention. The old docks have been converted into a sparkling marina of restaurants, executive flats, superstores and call centres, and the town is nearing full employment. Tidy new family hatchbacks line up outside the busy central shopping mall. But inside, the air is smoky, and the teenage girls are pushing buggies; they will die roughly 10 years younger than women in the south. On Friday night, it costs \u00a38.99 to get into a town-centre nightclub, with free drinks all night. </p> <p>The vigorous nightlife, cheerful spirit and passion for football could mislead an outsider into thinking that this a generic north-eastern town. But geography has isolated Hartlepool's 90,000 people. A curl of land on the North Sea, nobody travels through here on their way anywhere else, and this has produced a highly localised if not parochial sense of identity. Talk to anybody, and before long they will tell you one or both of the following. Hartlepool is the biggest village in the world. And if it could elect the football team mascot - a monkey - as mayor in 2001, then it is capable of almost anything on Thursday. </p> <p><b> A DJ in the House?</b><br> </p> <p> Within 24 hours of Mandelson's announcement, a short, mild-looking man had arrived in Hartlepool. Richard Pinnock is testament to the political truism that you cannot judge an election book by its cover. </p> <p>Pinnock belongs to a small elite of Lib Dem strategists whose byelection technique is legendary in political circles. Within five days, he had rented a three-storey former bank, installed phone lines and computers, printing machines and furniture, and assembled a campaign team of recent byelection veterans. The party's chief executive, Lord Rennard, took charge, and a week later the local branch selected its candidate. </p> <p>Ed Fordham was appointed to run the press office. Fordham's manner is unflappably sharp, but in the early days he introduced his candidate with the air of a bridegroom at the altar who still cannot quite believe his luck. Jody Dunn is a 35-year-old barrister. For seven years she was a DJ, before studying and sitting her A-levels in six weeks, taking a first from St Andrews, winning the European debating championships, and graduating from bar school in the top 15 in the country. Fluent in three languages, she has written two books and a regular newspaper column. She also has four children under the age of 10, and the blonde good looks of a TV presenter. </p> <p>So eager were the team to show off their candidate that they borrowed an idea from American elections and set up a blog, an internet diary Dunn has written every night of the campaign. It was the first ever candidate blog in a British election, and a risky experiment - perhaps more risky than anyone realised, for it may yet prove to have cost her the election. But the discovery of its perils was still weeks away, and the blog was launched as a symbol of the campaign's extravagantly accessible ethos. </p> <p>Before their HQ became plastered with posters, the Lib Dems could have been mistaken for a gathering of young Christians. The untamed hair and corduroy jackets played their part, but it was the unflagging zeal which lent the campaign its missionary tone. Their faith was inspired by the conviction that this time they had, if not God on their side, then three deadly weapons. </p> <p>The first was time. Had Mandelson not taken 24 hours to accept the Brussels offer, his resignation could have come before parliament rose, triggering a byelection in just three weeks. His hesitation had delayed the date until at the earliest September 30. \"It was madness.\" Fordham looked gleeful: \"A gift.\" </p> <p>The second was their candidate. Jody Dunn is the first woman to stand in Hartlepool since 1943, and in the early days campaign workers were still sneaking stunned glances at her, as though fearful she might vanish into smoke. Her one disadvantage was geography, for she came from a village called Gainford, near Darlington (30 miles down the road), so was not technically a local. But no one considered this a serious problem - and, besides, she had moved into a marina apartment the day after her selection. Fordham seemed at a loss to articulate her qualities. \"Well, you've met her,\" he would give up, spreading his hands. What else was there to say? </p> <p>But it was the third weapon that fired the fanatical ambition. In any election, every strategist searches for the single decisive issue around which to build a campaign. A threatened school closure is always useful; an environmental row can work. But right at the top of everyone's wish-list is a local hospital closure - and here was one in Hartlepool, a juicy electoral cherry, just waiting to be picked. It was simply a question of who could claim it first. </p> <p>Within days, orange posters shot up across the town: \"Jody Dunn - Save Hartlepool Hospital.\" By the time Labour's candidate had been selected, they were up in the windows of residents who had voted Labour all their life. </p> <p><b> Cigars and overcoats</b><br> </p> <p> Some details are the same in every campaign headquarters; trestle tables, laptops, boxes of leaflets, charts and ward maps pasted all over the walls. Copies of Bill Clinton's memoir have featured here as well, like an electoral lucky charm. But beyond these universals, every office tells the story of its occupying party. </p> <p>What lay hidden behind the front desk of Labour's HQ was unlikely to be more telling than their refusal to let visitors see. Labour have run their campaign from behind the locked door of a Victorian corner office just off York Road. If buzzed in, visitors would find themselves in a smart reception area. Handsome well-dressed staff could be spotted moving between offices beyond the reception, suggesting corporate efficiency. But their identities and activities remain cloaked in mystery; the party's press officer refused to allow me in. </p> <p>Adrian McMenamin is the classically hostile New Labour gatekeeper. Heavy with gloom, from the outset he has guarded Labour's candidate behind a wall of unhappy suspicion, and it would be some weeks before I was even allowed to meet Iain Wright. The candidate was placed in the charge of two omnipresent Labour MPs, a faintly funereal entourage of dark suits, cigars and immaculate overcoats. </p> <p>Wright is an unusually boyish 32 - a chartered accountant, town councillor, father of three, and unequivocally local. The party branch had made it clear it did not want another high flyer imposed from outside, so Labour's NEC was careful to include a Hartlepool man on the shortlist, whom they duly elected. \"Wright from the town; Wright for the town\", the campaign posters proclaimed. Doubts would later emerge about Wright's credentials as the local Labour choice, threatening the moral foundations of his candidacy. But on August 6 he was launched as the ultra-local antidote to Mandelson - Labour's reward to the town for putting up with its unloved and largely absent incumbent. </p> <p>The Conservative party rented a former beauty parlour on York Road, so had to improvise the office around rows of old washbasins. To the hilarity of their rivals, a note on the door in the early days advised visitors to \"knock loudly\", and although it was soon removed, an ominously forsaken calm prevailed. The shutters were usually down by 7pm. </p> <p>One might have expected the Tories to show more concern to make up for lost time. More than six weeks after Mandelson's announcement, their candidate had still been mysteriously unforthcoming. There was talk of a crisis, and rumours were rife - it was a Central Office plot to damage Liam Fox, notionally responsible for the campaign; alternatively, it was a plot to discredit Michael Howard. </p> <p>When a name was finally announced, the party put the delay down to its concern to \"make sure we had found absolutely the right candidate\". Jeremy Middleton is unquestionably impressive; a self-made millionaire from Newcastle, 43, he is the only candidate to have previously stood for parliament. But his \"rightness\" was somewhat undermined by the string of names known to have declined the candidacy before him. </p> <p>I called Central Office shortly after his selection. </p> <p>\"Yes, one of us will be appointed in the next 48 hours to run the show,\" a voice sighed. \"Then they'll go and set up camp up there, I suppose, and put up the tents, and send up some outriders and redcoats and what not. And then I suppose we'll wait to be slaughtered.\" </p> <p>Ghosts of grander days still graced the Tory HQ; the smart suits, the luxurious battle bus. Nothing of the sort elevated the Ukip campaign, which squashed itself into an old clothes shop at the other end of York Road, and had to make to do at first without even phone lines. The wild profusion of union flags suggested perhaps a village fete more than a political party, and the campaign got off to a wobbly start. </p> <p>Ukip selected a sweet-natured and likeable management consultant called Stephen Allison, 44. He had been an independent Hartlepool councillor, so was well known and popular in the town. But he had already belonged to both Labour and the Tories previously, and admitted at the outset to being \"completely politically naive\". When help arrived from the national party, it came in an improbable duet: ex-Tory MP, Piers Merchant, and ex-US naval officer, Steve Harris. Merchant is scrupulous concerning pinstripes and cufflinks. Harris, is a coarse, jowly \"American slob\" (his own words), who characterised their partnership as \"Laurel and Hardy. No, better still, the Odd Couple\". </p> <p>If comedy value decided elections, Ukip would gain their first MP on Thursday. A garrulous ex-hack called Clive Page was put in charge of press, and took the view that, \"It's only politics; nobody dies. You've got to have a laugh.\" An incorrigible wit (\"Welcome to Hartlepool; 90,000 people, and only eight surnames\") Page's only serious complaint was that the Hartlepool Mail refused to take Ukip seriously. Frustrated by the paper's preference for stories about children stung by bees, Page soon resorted to amusing himself by issuing spoof press releases about a fox savaging Allison's chickens. </p> <p>Further down York Road was the office of Respect. Respect's candidate is, by universal consent, the \"nicest man in Hartlepool\". Even his rivals queue up to praise John Bloom, whose local credentials are peerless, for Bloom helped found Hartlepool's Save Our Hospital campaign. A care worker Bloom, 39, is a thoughtful emigre from Labour, whose integrity is renowned. But it also made him resign from the hospital campaign on becoming a candidate, thus surrendering his strongest electoral card to the Lib Dems. </p> <p>By the time all parties had assembled their teams, Dunn was running away with the hospital. More than 30,000 residents signed a Save Our Hospital petition last year; the candidate who could convert these into votes would be untouchable. John Reid tried to wrest back control for Labour with a statement that as long as he was the secretary of state for health, Hartlepool's hospital was safe. The tactic backfired when it was pointed out that in the past seven years, Reid had been through seven different jobs. Labour were running scared, the Lib Dems crowed. </p> <p>One morning early in September, a gaggle of Labour activists marched down York Road with placards to demonstrate against Lib Dem crime policies, right outside their HQ. The Lib Dems had been tipped off, and were ready with rival placards. A scuffle broke out, a police van appeared - and in the Hartlepool Mail that afternoon, a photograph showed Labour's crime stunt being dispersed by the police. Lib Dem euphoria overflowed. Fordham had fresh posters printed up and posted around the office: \"It's the hospital, stupid.\" </p> <p>On September 8, the byelection was called for the 30. A tour of the offices up and down York Road that day felt like retracing a cycle of history. The Labour party looked like the Tories 15 years ago; awesomely professional, yet beginning to ossify, neurotic with power. The Tories conjured memories of Labour 20 years ago, lamed by internal rivalries and hopelessness. And the Lib Dems looked like Labour a decade ago - flying on hungry young self-belief. </p> <p><b> Jody come lately</b><br> </p> <p>If anyone ever doubted the length of a week in politics, the first seven days of the official Hartlepool campaign would settle the matter. </p> <p>On September 9, Blair issued a personal statement to the Hartlepool Mail. \"There is no question of the hospital closing or being run down. I hope people understand there has never been any question of the hospital closing, we are there to improve it and not run it down.\" </p> <p>Then Labour delivered a leaflet through every door quoting an interview with Dunn in the Teesdale Mercury from August 25. \"I love living in Gainford,\" she had enthused. How could a woman who claimed to have moved to Hartlepool in July \"love living in Gainford\" a month later? She was \"Jody Come Lately\", Labour laughed. </p> <p>The third assault was a devastating surprise. On August 27, Dunn had written in her blog about a dispiriting evening out canvassing with Simon Hughes. \"It didn't just rain last night, it poured,\" she wrote. \"In fact the evening became one of the more farcical moments of the campaign. We'd picked what appeared at first to be a fairly standard row of houses. As time went on however, we began to realise that everyone we met was either drunk, flanked by an angry dog or undressed.\" </p> <p>The blog had continued with a joke about how Dunn looked like Worzel Gummidge in the rain. Ed Fordham had checked the copy as usual before posting it online. Nothing he read had sounded alarm bells. </p> <p>The Labour printing machines turned again, and this time Hartlepool woke up to the news on its doormat that Dunn had accused them all of being \"either drunk, flanked by an angry dog, or undressed\". </p> <p>Channel 4 News announced the results of its poll on September 14. Labour were on 53%, the Lib Dems just 20%. The Tories had 13%, Ukip 9%. The first week of the official campaign wasn't even over, and already Labour had won. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1314297,00.html\">Read part two here</a></p>",
  "Since throwing his weight behind the Bush administration after September 11 2001, Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, has successfully portrayed himself as an indispensable ally in the US-led \"war on terror\". <p>The killing by Pakistani security forces of a senior al-Qaida operative, Amjad Hussain Farooqi, is the latest manifestation of that supposed indispensability. Under US pressure and after two assassination attempts last December, General Musharraf has intensified the hunt for terrorists, particularly in provinces bordering Afghanistan. </p> <p>But Pakistan's leader, who came to power in a 1999 coup and legitimised his rule through an unopposed referendum in 2002, remains a problematic partner for the west and a controversial figure at home. </p> <p>His ending of Pakistan's support for the Taliban and his backing for the US invasion of Afghanistan alienated Islamist parties. His decision to negotiate with India on Kashmir, formalised in January's Islamabad declaration, angered the jihadis and raised wider concerns about his intentions. </p> <p>Despite continuing worries domestically and in the west, Gen Musharraf says democracy is flourishing in Pakistan. He points to local elections, the presence of women in government and relatively free speech and media. </p> <p>He suggests most of his opponents are confined to the periphery of Pakistani society. \"The extremists dislike me because I'm operating against them,\" he told the Washington Post at the weekend. \"We are changing the entire psyche of our society, which has been held hostage to extremist ideas. The vast majority are moderate, but they were voiceless. The entire mindset needs to be changed.\" </p> <p>On all these issues, there are other views. Despite an upbeat meeting between Gen Musharraf and the new Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, at the UN last week, there are fresh allegations in India that Pakistan is overtly assisting militants in Kashmir. </p> <p>On Afghanistan, some western diplomats in Islamabad suspect elements within Pakistan's military Inter-Services Intelligence are happy to help track down al-Qaida but less keen on suppressing former Taliban proteges. This, it is argued, is because Pakistan, adhering to its long-established doctrine of \"strategic depth\" vis a vis India, wants a biddable regime in its rear in Kabul if western forces leave. </p> <p>The Afghan leader, Hamid Karzai, facing fraught presidential elections next month, has complained that Pakistan is not doing enough to curb resurgent Taliban attacks emanating from Pakistani soil. </p> <p>As with Indian claims about Kashmir, Gen Musharraf rejects the charges. But questions persist about the extent to which he is actually in control. </p> <p>New doubts about his commitment to democracy have been raised, meanwhile, by his suggestion that he may renege on an earlier promise to step down as army leader this year. </p> <p>The Musharraf conundrum is compounded by distorting US priorities. For there can be little doubt, despite denials all round, that Pakistan is under tremendous pressure to catch or kill Osama bin Laden before the US election on November 2. </p> <p>Only America's overriding political imperative explains President George Bush's unquestioning stance in his recent bilateral meeting with Gen Musharraf in New York. Mr Bush did not press Pakistan's leader on democratic reform, on advancing the dialogue with India, or on relations with Mr Karzai. </p> <p>The US president apparently ignored Gen Musharraf's sympathetic attitude to Iran's nuclear activities. He also skirted round the Pakistani leader's refusal to allow the US to interview the head of the secret Pakistani nuclear weapons proliferation network, Abdul Qadeer Khan. </p> <p>Mr Bush left unchallenged Pakistan's refusal to help in Iraq, where neutral Muslim troops are much needed. And he turned a blind eye to Gen Musharraf's sharp criticism of the Iraq war and his implied call for the withdrawal of US and British forces. </p> <p>Instead, according to US officials, Mr Bush made nice, focusing almost exclusively on the fight against al-Qaida and its elusive leader. </p> <p>Between himself and Mr Bush \"there is a total understanding\", said the indispensable Gen Musharraf.</p>",

  "While Sir Richard Branson talked about boldly going into space yesterday, his transport system back on Earth clanked to an embarrassing stop. <p>New \"tilting trains\", designed to cut journey times on the notorious west coast mainline limped to a halt at Carlisle and en route to London from Holyhead because of technical glitches. </p> <p>These included a new and unexpected case of \"possible wheel flattening\", which stopped the flagship Royal Scot service only 28 miles from the start of its journey from Glasgow to London. It was allowed to creep on to Carlisle at 50mph, less than half its intended average speed of 110mph. </p> <p>Both mishaps involved Virgin Trains' new fleet of Pendolinos, whose method of tilting while sweeping round curves depends on complex, potentially vulnerable systems. </p> <p>The normally upbeat Sir Richard has been dogged by memories of the advanced passenger train, a British Rail invention which pioneered tilting in the early 80s but was scrapped after only three, troubled commercial runs. </p> <p>Virgin said most of its Pendolino services yesterday had been punctual or within 10 minutes of schedule, after the completion of \u00a37.6bn of track improvements to the west coast line. A spokesman, Allan McLean, called the delays - of 30 minutes in north Wales and two hours on the Glasgow-to-London service - \"unfortunate on the inaugural day of our new timetable\". </p> <p>He said the 5.28am from the ferry terminal at Holyhead had been hit by faults in the electrical control system. The 9.49am Royal Scot was diagnosed with the suspected wheel flattening. </p> <p>Some 85 passengers from Glasgow changed trains at Carlisle and reached London after 6 hours, instead of cutting half an hour off the pre-Pendolino five-hour journey. </p> <p>Mr McLean said: \"The fault appears to be very unusual and it is not a significant problem.\" </p> <p>Previous problems with the Pendolino have created scepticism about the new service. But Virgin said it was encouraged by results overall yesterday, with 81 of 123 services early or on time.</p>",
  "<p>Office bullying has become rife within British workplaces, with 87% of human resources managers conceding it occurs within their organisations, manifesting in companies run \"on fear\", according to new research. </p> <p>The study, published today, showed many of those questioned felt they were failing to control the level of bullying, with more than 30% of employees leaving their jobs when the taunting unduly affected their work.</p> <p>In the survey of 1,000 senior professionals, one respondent recalled a boss pulling her out of a chair by her hair, while another said: \"Employees usually leave. Verbal abuse is extremely common. The company is run on fear which has an impact on productivity and sickness and staff turnover is very, very high.\"</p> <p>Lyn Witheridge, founder of the anti-bullying charity, The Andrea Adams Trust, who conducted the survey along with the magazine Personnel Today, said the charity received 70 calls a day. Since she founded it in 1997, there have been seven suicides which she believes were directly related to bullying.</p> <p>\"Because bullying is a very subjective issue, and the word has a lot of childish connotations surrounding it, people have spent a long time getting the courage to phone us, and by the time they do, the bullying is often very prevalent as is stress-related illness,\" she said.</p> <p>The people from whom the charity receives the most calls work with public bodies such as the NHS, teachers or call centres, where employees are under pressure to achieve targets. \"Self-esteem and self-confidence are so eroded that by the end of this horror they become dreadful wrecks, dealing with brutal psychological intimidation which has gone on day after day,\" she said.</p> <p>Ruth Johnston, 56, of Eastbourne, worked as a midwife for the NHS for many years, later accepting a position of senior midwife. Her manager adopted a hostile approach to managing her staff, she said.</p> <p>After several periods of sick leave she left for six months and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and has now retired due to recurring ill health.</p> <p>Jane King, editor of Personnel Today, said a lot of people were worried to report bullying and instead many opted to leave an organisation, with only 6% of bullied workers making use of their company's grievance procedure.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Blair today staked his third term ambitions on breaking the \"glass ceiling on opportunity\" that still exists for the majority of the country by delivering greater choice across public services.</p> <p>The modern welfare state should have citizens in the driving seat, with public services delivered by talented public servants \"set free\" from bureaucracy to concentrate on delivery, the Labour leader told his party's conference this afternoon.</p> <p>Listing \"10 pointers\" of policy which will define a third term Labour government, the prime minister pledged to ensure choice will allow everyone \"the right to demand the best and refuse the worst and do so not by virtue of your wealth but your equal status as a citizen\".</p> <p>Mr Blair announced new pledges, including increased investment in drug treatment, and \"universal, affordable and flexible childcare\" to ensure parents of three to 14-year-olds had provision from 8am to 6pm, mixed in with previously rehearsed public service improvement commitments announced earlier this year, as part of the three-year spending review.</p> <p>In line with the commitment made to unions at the Warwick summit this summer, Mr Blair also vowed to close the gender pay gap. The government has agreed to set up a commission on women and pay, which is due to report some recommendations in time for the drafting of New Labour's election manifesto.</p> <p>In his eighth Labour conference address as prime minister, Mr Blair painted the modern welfare state as one run by a government that \"does not dictate\", but \"empowers\".</p> <p>\"It makes the individual - patient, parent, law abiding citizen, job seeker - the driver of the system, not the state. It sets free the huge talent of our public servants and social entrepreneurs whose ability is often thwarted by outdated rules and government bureaucracy,\" Mr Blair said.</p> <p>Citing the year on year increases in public spending in health and education under New Labour, Mr Blair assured delegates that the party would not become complacent.</p> <p>Though a \"fairer Britain\" had been introduced under New Labour, he said, there was still some way to go to put \"power, wealth and opportunity ... in the hands of the many, not the few\".</p> <p>The \"third term mission\" for New Labour was to help overcome existing challenges \"for the many\".</p> <p>\"There is a glass ceiling on opportunity in this country\", he said. \"We have raised the ceiling. We haven't broken it.\"</p> <p>Commitments outlined under Mr Blair's 10 pointers included:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Special help for first time house buyers<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Patients' right to choose a hospital, including time and date of treatment<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Maximum hospital waiting times down from 18 months to 18 weeks - 100 new hospital schemes, 2,700 GP premises improved<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sure Start children centres in every community in Britain</p>",
  "The Labour party has reached a critical point. Membership has been haemorrhaging by the tens of thousands, trade unionists are restive and the idealism of Labour party activists and members is corroding. <p>The lack of trust on Iraq has dealt a body blow to the Labour party which we simply cannot ignore. The real job for Labour this week is to begin the process of restoring trust in the government, to regain the support of Labour voters and to convince activists that there will be a manifesto worth fighting for. </p> <p>Policy must once again be made in a more open and democratic way in our party. We have all had enough of decisions made in Downing Street, imposed on the parliamentary party from the top and driven through the Commons by heavy whipping. </p> <p>Constituencies up and down the country have been hollowed out and armies of activists have left to cultivate their gardens. If we are to bring them back, they must again have a real sense of democratic involvement in the party. </p> <p>It is Labour's role to provide a real alternative to the Conservatives. Labour is different, or was until recently. It is not good enough simply to rely for success at the next election on the enduring unpopularity of the Tories. </p> <p>We may have had passionate internal debates, but these have been real and necessary, giving the party credibility, with an identity, a philosophy and a coherence which for generations has commanded the loyalty of socialists, trade unionists and millions of ordinary people. But if we do not grapple with these current issues, we shall lose what is left of that commitment, that loyalty and optimism for working people. </p> <p>But we have to go further - we have to regain the trust of Labour voters that we will deliver a manifesto that reflects our true aims and values. In opposition, we were against the privatisation of air traffic control, then did the opposite in power. In our last manifesto, we committed ourselves specifically to opposing top-up fees and then did the opposite in power. Foundation hospitals were dreamed up in Spain, taken up by Downing Street, rubber stamped by the cabinet and flogged through the Commons in the face of huge opposition, with no reference at all to such a policy in our 2001 manifesto. </p> <p>The post-1997 election euphoria arose because people assumed that Thatcherism had been buried by Labour's massive victory. Seven years later, vestiges of the Thatcher era remain, and Labour voters stay at home. Nearly half of all voters don't believe there is much difference between the major parties. They don't see what Labour has achieved - fantastic advances in social justice, anti-poverty measures, the minimum wage, huge investment in our public services. </p> <p>It is significant that when the Liberal Democrats nudge slightly to the left they pick up votes, but they will never be seen to be a party of the left because most of their seats are in essentially Conservative areas. Their chameleon politics, adapted to differing local electoral habitats, will always mean that they are not wholly trusted. </p> <p>That does not mean we can sit back. Despite the fact that we have the lowest level of unemployment in a generation and rising living standards, the good society that most people crave has not been delivered. Gross inequalities remain, public services are still under stress and local authority housing shortages have reached crisis proportions. </p> <p>Our leaders are winching Britain steadily closer to America - privatisation, marketisation, liberalisation and flexible labour markets are being driven from Downing Street, against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the population. </p> <p>We must not go into the next general election campaigning simply on the basis that we are not the Tories and that if you want to stop the Tories, you have to vote Labour. We have to adopt a manifesto that resonates with the public and Labour grassroots, enthuses core activists and gets the troops out on the doorsteps campaigning for it. </p> <p>And I include in that the trade unions - as part of the party it's our members, our activists who get out the vote. They need a manifesto they can believe in. They want a government they can trust. The Warwick commitments have gone some way to help, and we will keep the prime minister to his promise to deliver on those before the next election. They showed what can be achieved by working together. Our contemporary motion to the conference makes that clear. </p> <p>We do know, however, that there are some in the party who would prefer the unions to shut up and go away. We won't. Time will tell whether Warwick has bought peace between the unions and the Labour hierarchy. </p> <p>As general secretary of Unison, with 1.3 million public-sector workers, it's not a time for me to be heads down, gobs shut for Labour. It's a time for me to stand up for public services and the improvements that are being generated from within. Those improvements will win the next election. </p> <p>The prime minister speaks of delivery; for us delivery is all important on the Warwick commitments. </p> <p>The Labour party conference and the manifesto process provide an opportunity for the leadership to listen and change. If the government wishes to become genuinely popular again, with voters flocking to the polls with enthusiasm, Labour's leaders must rekindle the idealism and commitment which brought us all into the Labour movement and inspired millions of our citizens throughout the generations to vote Labour. </p> <p>Dave Prentis is the general secretary of Unison </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:press.office@unison.org.uk\">press.office@unison.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Vodafone yesterday announced plans to raise an additional \u00a32.5bn a year through cost savings and increasing its market share within the next four years. </p> <p>In a seven-hour presentation to City analysts, chief executive Arun Sarin also promised that the cash-rich mobile phone company would increase its payouts to shareholders when it announces its half-year figures in November. </p> <p>\"The board is minded to increase the amount of returns we are giving to our shareholders,\" he told the meeting at the company's headquarters outside Newbury in Berkshire. </p> <p>\"We are highly conscious of the fact that we are only paying out 22% of our earnings. We are clearly interested in having the dividend be a competitive dividend on a forward-going basis.\" </p> <p>In May, having made \u00a38.5bn in the previous year, Vodafone announced plans to spend \u00a33bn buying back its shares. It also handed back \u00a31.4bn to shareholders in dividends. But with 66bn shares in issue many investors saw the buyback as a drop in the ocean and have been calling on the company to increase its dividend payments. </p> <p>Vodafone's presentation to investment professionals was designed to give Mr Sarin, who took over from Sir Christopher Gent more than a year ago, a chance to show how the company has progressed. </p> <p>Analysts also heard from the heads of the company's businesses in Germany, Italy, Japan and the US. </p> <p>Vodafone outlined how its \"One Vodafone\" plan will lead to an annual \u00a31.4bn saving in operating expenses by March 2008. The scheme, which was put in place under Sir Christopher's reign, is designed to bring together the group's businesses across the globe to cut out duplication and increase buying power for equipment such as handsets. </p> <p>Vodafone added that it intends to generate an additional \u00a31.1bn of annual revenue over the next four years by increasing the company's market share in its main regions. </p> <p>The company reiterated its financial guidance for the year saying that growth in customer numbers and profit margins is expected to be in the \"high single digits\". </p> <p>But shares in the company dipped 1.75p to 129p as traders reported disappointment that Vodafone's management had not been more upbeat about prospects. </p> <p>Mr Sarin's relationship with analysts got off to a rocky start after the company made a surprise and fruitless attempt to buy US rival AT&amp;T Wireless last winter. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Sarin said Vodafone remains interested in gaining control of its joint venture in the US market, Verizon Wireless. Analysts see little prospect of partner Verizon Communications selling out. </p> <p>\"Both parents would like to own more of this asset,\" admitted Mr Sarin. </p> <p>Vodafone receives a dividend from Verizon Wireless but the current deal is due to end next year. Mr Sarin hinted yesterday that a new deal may be some way off. </p> <p>He stressed that Vodafone's management is generally satisfied with its current geographic reach but continued to be interested in buying control of French operator SFR from fellow shareholder Vivendi Universal. </p> <p>He added that Vodafone was also looking into eastern Europe for potential growth markets.</p>",
  "<p>It's not often I am able to recommend an English film or television series about lawyers and the law. As I have written on countless occasions, compared to the Americans, we seem incapable of putting together a drama that is neither boring nor sensationally wrong in its legal details and atmosphere. </p> <p>My main gripe about the new series Outlaws is that it's only on BBC3 (starting on Friday evening). It deserves a wider audience. It is very funny, very exaggerated, wonderfully un-PC, satirical with touches of surrealism but, like all good satire, with enough truth in it to instil unease. </p> <p>Phil Daniels (whom readers of a certain generation associate indelibly with the head mod riding his Vespa in the film Quadrophenia) is terrific as the seedy ambulance-chasing northern solicitor Dunbar, forever handing out his business cards to likely youngsters (with the admonition, \"Don't behave yourselves\") and doing dubious deals with the police to keep his usually guilty clients out of jail. </p> <p>Dunbar's new assistant, a winning performance by Ray Emmett-Brown, is Theo, a naive young black public-school type who became a lawyer in order to do good, and is suitably bewildered and offended by the dubious tricks of the trade he is expected to adopt. </p> <p>\"I'll tell you the truth,\" a client found with drugs in his car says to Dunbar. The solicitor looks horrified: \"The more truth you tell me, the fewer options we have,\" he explains. He hands out pairs of spectacles to three youths, on the grounds that they will look more respectable in the dock. The two who refuse to wear them are sent to prison; the one who puts them on gets a non-custodial sentence. </p> <p>The police try to persuade a prolific burglar to confess to an array of crimes he didn't do, to enable them to clear their books of unsolved break-ins. He tries to tell them of all the burglaries he has actually committed. The police aren't interested. Another burglar has already confessed to those. </p> <p>Of course Outlaws (script by Steve Coombes) is overly cynical. But it manages, amid the exaggerations and the humour, to point to real problems - the lack of facilities for mentally disturbed offenders, the laws of evidence which allow clearly guilty serious criminals to walk free, the ubiquity of drugs in the criminal justice system. </p> <p>Incidentally, Emmett-Brown is also a barrister, though he makes it clear that he is primarily an actor who happened to be called to the bar rather than a lawyer doing a bit of acting. He hasn't yet practised as a barrister; until the role of Theo came up, he was working as a para-legal with an Eastbourne firm of solicitors, Rodney Warren &amp; Co, a job to which he will return - unless, of course, success in Outlaws takes him in a direction that will make his legal qualifications unnecessary. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Now that citizenship has become part of the national curriculum, schoolchildren are at least being fed some knowledge about the law and the legal system, though there are enormous differences in the time devoted to legal matters within the wide-ranging course as well as the quality of the teaching. </p> <p>But that welcome improvement only nibbles at the vast mountain of public ignorance about the way the legal system works. I know of no other developed country in which the average citizen knows so little about something so potentially important to him or her, let alone its significance as a cornerstone of democracy. A new initiative launched yesterday urges the government to establish a national strategy to educate the public about the law. The organisations Advice Services Alliance, Citizenship Foundation and Legal Action Group point out that around one million legal problems a year remain unresolved because people don't know how to go about dealing with them: a coordinated approach is urgently needed to increase people's legal knowledge and provide information about the options for resolving disputes. </p> <p>See <a href=\"http://www.advicenow.org.uk\">www.advicenow.org.uk</a> which not only has the full discussion paper on the future of public education about the law, but is also the liveliest, least stuffy, most accessible and understandable website on legal matters that I've come across.</p>",
  "Fistfights broke out yesterday between Christians gathered on the site of the crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. <p>\"There was lots of hitting going on.

  "Labour party members in Hartlepool are threatening to deselect their candidate before the general election, even if he wins Thursday's byelection. <p>Unhappiness with the national party's control over the candidate's selection process has prompted some to boycott Iain Wright's campaign.

It was shocking - a disgrace,\" Mr Fisher said. \"I can only assume the NEC had an image of what they wanted, someone who'd say yes to everything and wouldn't rock the boat.\" </p> <p>Ray Waller, a councillor for 41 years, said: \"A number of us were surprised there was only one local candidate, and I think once we have got the election over with there will be a discussion, when we make our minds up whether or not to stick with Iain. </p> <p>\"I think it would have given Iain more credibility within the party if other local candidates had been on the shortlist, and that's a view that most party members would share.\" </p> <p>Two-thirds of the local party stayed away from the meeting at which Mr Wright was selected. </p> <p>Robbie Payne, a councillor for the last nine years and cabinet member for four, was one of the nominees rejected by the NEC, and is supporting calls for a new selection process after the election. </p> <p>\"Iain's exactly what New Labour want,\" he said. </p> <p>Anger intensified last month when it became known that Mr Wright's team had offered the local mayor, an independent, a deal for his support. In return for the mayor's endorsement, Labour offered to stand a weak candidate against him at the next mayoral election. The mayor has declined to endorse anyone. </p> <p>Many members are unhappy with the tone of Mr Wright's campaign, which has focused on attacks against the Liberal Democrat candidate's character, and on a promise to \"clear the streets of yobs and thugs\". </p> <p>\"I've worked in every general election since 1955,\" said Mr Waller, \"and it's always been focused on the issues. </p> <p>\"I've delivered leaflets on a couple of occasions this time, and I'm not very happy with the way personality attacks have been the main focus.\" The budget for a byelection is \u00a3100,000, but in the general election the branch will be allowed less than \u00a320,000, and have to rely on local voluntary activists. </p> <p>This support will not be forthcoming, according to Mr Fisher, unless the selection process is allowed to take place again. </p> <p>Iain Wright said the NEC's choice of shortlist was not a matter for him to discuss. \"We are reinvigorating the party. We have 30 new members as a result of this byelection.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the applause for Gordon Brown's barnstorming speech surged round the Brighton conference centre, up on the platform Tony Blair gave his chancellor a very public and very hefty clap on the back. If you believed everything you read, Blair should have had a dagger in his hand. Neither for the first time nor the last, the reality was less dramatic and more complex. </p> <p>By any careful and objective standards, the speech that Brown gave yesterday ought to be classified as a New Labour speech delivered by a New Labour politician. Brown uses that label often and willingly. Most of his advisers are comfortable with it. And, more importantly, the language and content of the speech were New Labour too. </p> <p>Take the speech's most reiterated phrase about the need for a \"new progressive consensus\". Nothing Old Labour about that. Progressive is one of the quintessential New Labour words; a word that, if one was trying to sow discord, one would even describe as Mandelsonian. And what about that passage in which Brown talked about not resting until the public services are \"reformed and renewed\"? Or the sentence in which he said there can be \"no security without change\"? Or the contemptuous dismissal of the very idea of rail renationalisation? </p> <p>The Blair-Brown relationship being what it is, there is a ready market for the view that in some sections of his speech the chancellor carefully signalled a different - and generally more statist, pro-union, anti-market and even Old Labour - agenda from the prime minister's. As he approached his peroration, Brown conjured up a Britain defined by free state-provided health and education and by a public service ethic, contrasting its values with \"those of contracts, markets and exchange\". </p> <p>Those words drew spontaneous applause from parts of the hall. But Brown has become a past master at allowing people to project on to him views that he does not hold. Brown's public-service vision exists alongside his commitment to the British economic model of \"competition, liberalisation and reform\" of which he also spoke yesterday, and which he regularly contrasts with Europe's welfare-heavy lack of economic dynamism. His advocacy of public-private partnerships has also been a leitmotif of his Treasury years. </p> <p>That is not to say Brown's was the kind of speech that Blair would have written for him. There is no chance of that. The basic reason for this, as usual, is that Brown aimed his speech at a party audience. That's too often his default setting - and the reason why the Liberal Democrats and the Tories would relish their prospects under a Brown premiership. A Blair speech, like the one the prime minister will deliver today, is different. It has the whole nation as its audience. </p> <p>This distinction goes to the heart of why Labour is still better off with Blair and Brown working in tandem rather than against one another. Brown may touch the Labour party's soul, but he is perceived by the voters as someone well to the left of the majority. Blair may perpetually leave Labour audiences wondering whether he is really one of them, but even today, as a YouGov survey in yesterday's Daily Telegraph showed, Blair remains the undisputed king of the centre ground - without which Labour loses elections. </p> <p>Brighton has fizzed with speculation about whether, when and how the prime minister may fall and the chancellor succeed him. It was hard to listen to the warmth of the applause that welcomed Brown to the rostrum yesterday and not construe it partly as a yearning for new leadership - or at least for a simpler political life. </p> <p>Brown is a protean public figure, a formidable chancellor and a man who knows exactly how to make a speech that will rekindle the party's fervour. But this strength is also a kind of limitation. Brown is nothing if not a party man. He did not get where he is today by letting his discipline slip. Which is why, in the end, Brown delivered a party loyalist speech not a leadership bid. </p> <p>This is not exactly how Brown's speech had been trailed. The chancellor's outriders spent Sunday whispering into favoured ears that Brown's speech would be a coded attack on Blair, as revenge for Brown's disputed removal from the centre of the Labour re-election campaign. It is true that the speech can be deconstructed to expose discordant signals, and it is beyond dispute that Brown was hurt by this month's reshuffle. But it is just as true that the speech sent out harmonious signals as well. Brown speeches frequently touch all the bases in this way. By comparison with last year's undisguised aggression towards Blair, however, it was muted - and this is perhaps the key point. </p> <p>Yesterday Brown again proved why he is the natural successor to Blair. But this is not a new revelation. Everyone knows, and most Labour people still accept, that Brown is the leader in waiting. However, everyone also knows that Brown is extremely cautious - with the striking exception of last year's taunting speech - about forcing the issue. </p> <p>Ironically, that dilemma may be taken out of Brown's hands on Thursday. For both Blair and Brown the most important scheduled event of the week takes place on the North Sea coast rather than the south coast. Thursday's Hartlepool byelection is the kind of contest that used to galvanise the whole of party politics and political journalism. Today, with byelections more ruthlessly controlled from the centre and hence less characterful, such contests are less high profile. But they still matter just as much as they used to. </p> <p>It has been a long time since a party leader's future hung on the future of a byelection. But it is true of Blair and Hartlepool on Thursday. If the Liberal Democrat Jody Dunn manages to suck up the anti-Labour vote to defeat Labour's Iain Wright, then Blair's grip on power would be rocked. Blair has sometimes said that he would not hang around if he thought he was a liability to his party's electoral chances. Defeat for Labour on Thursday would leave him staring that conclusion in the face. </p> <p>The more intriguing scenario, though, concerns the aftermath of a Labour victory. If Wright is elected to replace Peter Mandelson, then Labour will judge that the electoral sea-wall has held against the high tide of disaffection with the Blair government. A Wright victory will lead Labour to conclude that Blair is safe to lead the party into the general election. </p> <p>It all depends on the scale of the Labour victory. Mandelson had a 38-point lead when he retained the seat in 2001. If Wright sees off the challengers with a win of that kind, then Blair is entitled to conclude that the worst is over. But if the lead is down to single figures, Labour MPs all around the country will be looking down the barrel of a gun. And that could start a process that even Gordon Brown's hard-wired caution may be unable to resist. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>It's been a tough few weeks for Harry Kroto. When not commuting to Korea and Croatia, he's been up at six, carting papers from his old office in the chemistry building at Sussex University to a glorified broom cupboard on the third floor. Not to mention cancelling the credit cards that disappeared from his desk in the move. Life as a Nobel laureate is all glamour.</p> <p>Navigating into his new den requires some athleticism. First you shuffle past a six-foot barrier of intrays, then you have to spin the one available chair to arrive at the only free space, next to his computer. Kroto is staring at an email. He is meant to be speaking in India next month and no one has remembered he needs a visa. Before long there's a knock at the door. It's a member of staff who's about to be laid off after 12 years, and Kroto is trying to juggle his grants to ensure the man gets the best possible pay-off. \"I just don't need all this,\" he mutters grumpily.</p> <p>It's not hard to see why Kroto has decided to up sticks after more than 30 years at Sussex. Next year he hits 65, and though he might have been able to squeeze a contract for another year or so, he couldn't face filling in more reams of research grant applications.</p> <p>So when Florida State University (FSU) in Tallahassee approached him with a bucketful of cash to continue his research in the US; guaranteed funding for the Vega Science Trust, his educational website; promised three months in the UK each year; and licence to continue his globetrotting activities, he was tempted.</p> <p>Even so, it took two years to make up his mind to go. \"I didn't really want to leave the country,\" he says, \"but in the end I didn't feel I had any other choice. No one else was offering me such a good deal. When I went to tell the vice-chancellor of my decision he said: 'You don't expect me to match FSU's offer.' I replied: 'No.' And that was that.\" It's sod's law that since Kroto went public with his decision, several UK universities have promised him the world.</p> <p>Kroto's parents fled Berlin in the 1930s, and he was brought up in Bolton. \"My father was an engineer,\" he says, \"and was always pushing me towards doing something useful. So I was naturally drawn towards chemistry.\" His first major achievement, though, had nothing to do with science: \"I was the Duke of York to Ian McKellen's Henry V in the school play. Quite properly, I was the only English knight to die at Agincourt.\"</p> <p>His second landmark achievement also had nothing to do with chemistry. Kroto has always been interested in graphics, and as a student won a newspaper competition to design a book jacket. Even now he likes to keep his hand in. He points to the NextGen logo on the fleece he's wearing. \"I got paid $2,500 [\u00a31,400] for that,\" he says. \"It's always been in the back of my mind that I could set up a graphics studio if science didn't work out.\"</p> <p>But science did work out. Kroto would have left his mark on chemistry with both his creation of carbon/phosphorous double-bonds - \"I recently saw a new chemistry textbook that said this was impossible some 25 years after I proved it was\" - and the discovery of carbon chains in space. Yet he was not to be denied a hat trick, and in 1985 made the big time with the discovery of buckminsterfullerenes (C <sub>60 </sub>), a third form of carbon after diamond and graphite, in soccer ball-shaped molecules of 60 atoms each.</p> <p>The discovery was a natural follow-on to his work on carbon chains and was made during a two-week period of experiments at Rice University, Texas, with American scientists Rick Smalley and Bob Curl. The existence of C <sub>60 </sub> had been hypothesised, but no one had predicted they might form spontaneously: \"It changed our understanding of nanostructures. Before that we thought that carbon atoms grouped in sheets - now we realised they closed in on one another to form closed balls.\"</p> <p>Kroto had been amazed at the strength of the radio signal given out by C <sub>60 </sub> and was confident of his findings. He went public with his conjecture, but even then wasn't sure the process was anything more than a minor part of the total system. This turned out to be a big mistake, and the next five years proved frustrating.</p> <p>First off, several groups of scientists dedicated their lives to proving him wrong: \"It all got a bit personal. Others had done exactly the same experiment as me and failed to spot the existence of C <sub>60 </sub>. They had literally let the Nobel prize slip through their hands.\" Next, Kroto overestimated the difficulties of extracting C <sub>60 </sub>, and put in a bid for funding for a mass spectrometer. For two years, the bid was rejected and in 1980, just a few weeks before he was due to publish his final proof, the German team of Kratschmer and Huffman got in first and won the plaudits.</p> <p>He was eventually rewarded with the Nobel prize in 1996, although he missed the phone call that informed him. \"You hear through the grapevine that you're in the running,\" he says, \"but on the day I forgot all about it and went out to the pub for lunch.\" </p> <p>The timing had a nice irony, for only hours before - causing huge embarrassment for the engineering and physical science research council - he had been refused a \u00a3100,000 grant for research into exactly the same subject.</p> <p>Eight years on, Kroto has a nice line in insouciance: \"These things happen the whole time. It wasn't personal.\" But he can't disguise his resentment at the funding system: not just for the time he has wasted on failed bids and the subsequent hiccups in research, but for the time spent on successful bids. \"None of my three contributions to science has come as a result of anything I've written for a research grant application. They've all come about as spin-off from other work. You can't always plan for everything, and for some research the only person really qualified to judge whether a proposal is worthwhile is the person who has written it.</p> <p>\"The way we distribute research funds needs to be changed. We should give money automatically to those whose last report was good. Money should also go to university departments to fund projects for younger members of staff, and finally some cash should go to those whose last project didn't go so well, providing they also get financial help from industry.\"</p> <p>Kroto realises there's not a hope anyone will take these ideas seriously, but a Nobel prize gives you a certain licence to shoot your mouth off. The bean-counters will continue to obsess about numbers, targets and outcomes, but Kroto is just passionate about the science. Which is why he's devoted so much of the past 10 years to the Vega Science Trust, to producing educational programmes for TV and the net. \"Look,\" he says, clicking through the site. \"Where else can you watch lectures by Richard Feynman and Max Perutz for nothing? Caltech would charge hundreds of dollars for this.\"</p> <p>If part of his motivation is a benevolent desire to instil an enthusiasm for science, you can't help feeling that another large part is exasperation at the public's lack of understanding of the issues. \"Saying that we should stop nanoscience,\" he says, \"is tantamount to saying we should stop science.</p> <p>\"Imagine if we had stopped science in 1904. Yes, there would have been no nerve gas and no Bhopal, but there would also have been no penicillin. All science is a trade-off. It's great to see the bald eagle flying over the Mississippi once more since DDT was banned, but the cost is the deaths from malaria of between 1 and 2 million young children in Africa each year.\"</p> <p>In the US, Kroto's work will focus on applications of C <sub>60 </sub>. \"There has been some interesting work into nanotubes,\" he says, \"but it's been barking up the wrong tree.\" He declines to say what the right tree might be, but no one should bet against him adding to his hat-trick.</p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sir Harry Kroto</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 64</p> <p><strong>Jobs:</strong> Royal Society research professor, Sussex University; chairman, Vega Science Trust; president, Royal Society of Chemistry; visiting professor at University of California, Santa Barbara</p> <p><strong>Awards:</strong> fellow of Royal Society, 1990; joint Nobel prize for chemistry, 1996; knighted, 1996</p> <p><strong>Publications:</strong> more than 300 papers on chemistry, physics and astronomy</p> <p><strong>Likes:</strong> graphic design</p> <p><strong>Dislikes:</strong> religion</p> <p><strong>Married:</strong> with two sons</p>",
  "<p>Every week brings new scare stories about binge drinking and excessive alcohol consumption among young people. Preventative measures focus on reducing the appeal of alcohol and making it more difficult to get hold of, yet little attention is paid to the possibility of actively challenging the motivations to use - or misuse - alcohol.</p> <p>Research being conducted from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College, London, aims to do just that. Numerous studies have demonstrated that there are psychological factors common to many people who develop problems with alcohol and drugs. \"There's lots of evidence that these psychological factors can indicate who might be prone to develop a problem,\" says Dr Patricia Conrod, a clinical psychologist and clinical lecturer, who is leading the project.</p> <p>\"The factors are impulsivity, sensation-seeking, anxiety and depression. People who display these types of personality are more likely to use alcohol as a way to deal with their emotions: to enhance the positive or cope with the negative.\"</p> <p>The work being done in London is a replication of a project Conrod worked on in Canada. \"We invited students who were showing some risk to participate in group therapy intervention session to learn ways to better manage those factors.\" A grant from Action on Addiction has enabled the same project to be established here. It will run for three and a half years, and last year involved eight schools across London. This year, 15 schools have already participated in the project, with years 9, 10 and 11 (age 14 to 16) involved in the group sessions.</p> <p>The research process has been modified for England. \"In the group sessions we do lots of reading through scenarios,\" says Conrod. \"They have to reflect real life. In Canada 16- and 17-year-olds have access to cars, so lots of risk-taking and impulsive behaviour relates to that. In London, it's manifested in a different way.\"</p> <p>The first wave of London interventions will be followed up over the next few months to see what impact they have had on the students who took part; another set of interventions will also take place. If they replicate the results of the Canadian research, they will be dramatic. \"In Canada, the kids who took part in the interventions displayed higher levels of abstinence relative to a control group. And these were kids, remember, who had already displayed behaviour that indicated they might develop problems with alcohol.</p> <p>\"But what was most interesting is that the interventions had an effect on the specific behaviours that were most risky for that personality type. Thrill-seekers, for example, tend to binge drink, but that was reduced among that group.\"</p> <p>If the research here goes well, it could play a part in strategy for reducing alcohol misuse among young people. \"If we replicate the results here, and demonstrate that this type of intervention is useful, the later part of the project will involve dissemination of the results, promoting what we've discovered and offering training so it can be carried out in other schools,\" says Conrod.</p> <p>\"The biggest problem we're having at the moment is getting schools to be involved. Some are so overwhelmed, there's no space in the curriculum. But others are a bit protective of their reputation and think that getting involved would indicate a problem in the school. It's a shame because the feedback we get from the students who participate is so positive.</p> <p>\"There's a much larger sign-up for the group sessions here than in Canada. It's about 85%, which shows that the students are really interested in doing this kind of work, and they really enjoy it. There's a real need for this kind of discussion in schools here.\"</p>",
  "<p>A well known headteacher in middle England once demonstrated over a sustained period how he changed the behaviour of his pupils and staff by talking to them firmly but nicely. Behaviour that is rewarded tends to be repeated. In the classroom, this basic principle has been expressed under various names: positive feedback, reinforcement, operant conditioning, behaviour modification, assertive discipline.</p> <p>Focusing on positive aspects is far more rewarding for teachers than focusing on punishments and threats. There is a contradiction between engaging pupils in the process of learning, and threatening to punish them if disaffected or disruptive.</p> <p>In practice, a teacher must use rewards and praise and, if necessary, punishments and warnings. To be effective, teachers need to be realistic in their expectations of the class and individuals, and place more emphasis on rewards and encouragement than on blame. Teachers must be ready to learn from colleagues and pupils; they must be receptive to new situations and ideas. Above all, a teacher must be fair and consistent.</p> <p>Positive reinforcers include smiles, verbal approval, tangible rewards, earned points, commendations and the appreciation of peers and teachers. The only way a teacher knows if a reinforcer is positive is to see if it encourages productive behaviour.</p> <p>The problem with negative reinforcers is that, while they may reduce the questionable behaviour, they do not necessarily create productive results. Punishment can be a double-edged sword, because of pupils' desire for attention. They may become heroes amongst their peers for being reprimanded in class.</p> <p>There are other strategies for modifying behaviour. Teachers may focus on a specific behaviour, or aspect of behaviour, to develop a pupil's ability to improve. For example, a pupil who cannot concentrate for a whole lesson may be encouraged to focus on the introductory session. A teacher will ignore unproductive behaviour, with the aim of extinguishing it.</p> <p>No policy, procedure or school rule ever altered pupils' behaviour on its own. It is the quality of the interactions with pupils in the use of rewards and other consequences that will make the biggest impact on good behaviour. To work this way effectively means considering carefully what strategies are available and, crucially, how to employ them.</p> <p>A vital part of encouraging good behaviour is rewarding it when it happens. Teachers play an important role in noticing small instances of good behaviour and giving the pupil positive feedback with smiles, nods, and phrases such as \"well done\".</p> <p>For behaviour that interferes with basic rights or breaks the rules, the logical response would be to get the pupil to make a better choice. Following the poacher/gamekeeper principle, pupils who take ownership of an issue learn self-control that will be sustained beyond the classroom and school. A quiet word will have a greater impact than a shout, as will a smile, thumbs-up or a symbolic reward such as a sticker or merit. Pupils are no different from adults - they like to be talked to firmly but nicely.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Professor Sonia Blandford is dean of education at Canterbury Christ Church University College. <a href=\"mailto:masterclass@cant.ac.uk\">masterclass@cant.ac.uk</a></p>",

Devise a role-play in which students (playing the roles of MPs, the Serjeant at Arms, the Metropolitan police and MI6 security forces) are asked to present their views on the future of Westminster's security to a select committee.</p> <p>Commentators are speculating on the impact of a future invasion by a protest group less benign than the Countryside Alliance. Ask students to produce a piece of argumentative writing that seeks to weigh up the need for public access to parliament against the dangers of a terrorist attack on MPs.</p> <p><strong>How protest works</strong></p> <p>Explain the concept of \"open government \" to the class, focusing on the democratic ideal of a building open to all (a study of the double meaning of the word \"lobby\" might be interesting here)). Ask students to list the ways in which parliament has traditionally promoted its transparency and accessibility.</p> <p>Define some of the key terms in the debate, paying particular attention to difficult concepts such as \"direct action \", \"non-violent protest \" and \"non-cooperation \". With reference to recent high-profile security breaches, help students to understand the nature of the protests being made. Use this discussion as a way in to considering the role of the media publicity stunt in modern protest.</p> <p>The Countryside Alliance has promised that more civil unrest is on the way. Look in detail at the non-cooperation threatened over the coming months (at <a href=\"http://www.countryside-alliance.org.uk\">www.countryside-alliance.org.uk</a>). Challenge pupils to list ways in which they might register their support for a particular cause or pressure group. Findings could be formulated in a table in which categories such as media impact, legality and overall effectiveness are addressed.</p> <p><strong>This lesson is written for key stage 3 but can be adapted for other ages</strong></p> <p><strong>Key stage 2 (age 7-11)</strong> Ask students to compile a list of the security measures they have encountered (for example, being watched on CCTV or going through baggage checks at the airport). Explain the use and function of some of the security checks employed in major public institutions. Encourage students to discuss the difference between visible and invisible security and to find examples of each.</p> <p>Using a plan diagram of parliament, ask students to research and identify the name and function of the major chambers and public spaces. In groups, pupils should devise a security plan for the building; challenge them to use as many different devices and procedures as they can, while stressing the need for security to remain discreet.</p> <p>In groups, students should list some of the reasons why a member of the public might want to contact his or her MP. Using the internet and local telephone directories, ask the class to find out the name and contact details of their local representatives. Once these details have been found, pupils could either write to their MP stating whether or not they agree that security should be made tighter in parliament, or send him /her their new security plan, complete with annotations and a covering note.</p> <p><strong>Key stage 4 (age 14-16)</strong> As part of the GCSE English curriculum, use the title \"What price democracy?\" to encourage students to write a response to the recent proposals for a reform to parliament's security. The piece could take the form of a newspaper article seeking to analyse and comment on the balance between the safety of MPs and public access to their representatives.</p> <p>The law defines terrorism as the use of threat to intimidate the public or influence the government. Ask groups of students to research different news stories relating to recent examples of direct action and violence with a view to measuring their intentions and impact against this definition of terrorism. Once the research has been presented to the class, structure a debate around the motion \"This House believes that direct action has no place in a democracy\".</p> <p>Using a website such as <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk\">www.parliament.uk</a>, challenge students to research the history and traditions of the Palace of Westminster. Their findings should be presented in a timeline that records the major changes to buildings, customs and public access. Ask students to extend this timeline until 2104, speculating on future changes that they imagine would have an impact on the way our democracy functions.</p> <p><strong>Curriculum links</strong></p> <p><strong>KS2</strong><br> <strong>Citizenship</strong> QCA scheme of work 10, 11<br> <strong>English</strong> (Speaking and listening) 1c, 2a-c, 3a-f; (reading) 2a, 2b, 5a, 5b; (writing) 1a, 1e<br> <strong>ICT</strong> 1a-c, 3a, 3b; QCA scheme of work 5C</p> <p><strong>KS3</strong><br> <strong>Citizenship</strong> 1a, 1d, 1h, 2a-c, 3a; QCA scheme of work 6, 9<br> <strong>English</strong> (Speaking and listening) 1a-c, 2a-f, 3a-e, 4a; (reading) 1a-d, 4a-c, 5a; (writing) 1i-k<br> <strong>ICT</strong> 1a, 1b, 3a-c, 4a; QCA scheme of work 10</p> <p><strong>KS4</strong><br> <strong>Citizenship</strong> 1a, 1c, 1f, 2a-c, 3a; QCA scheme of work 8<br> <strong>English</strong> (Speaking and listening) 1a, 1b, 2a-f, 3a-e; (reading) 1a-d, 4a-c, 5a; (writing) 1l-o<br> <strong>ICT</strong> 1a, 1b, 3a, 3b, 4a</p> <p><strong>Scottish curriculum 5-14</strong><br>English language<br> Expressive arts<br> Personal and social development</p>",
  "<p>By the end of today, with the prime minister's speech behind us, we will no doubt be told that the general election campaign has been kicked off. Any mention of education will have been couched in terms we can all applaud - opportunity for all; a happy, well-educated workforce; poverty and disadvantage a thing of the past - themes that have run through most conference speeches over the past 10 years. All that remains now is the tricky task of drawing up a manifesto to deliver these lofty goals that the party can feel proud of and the public will believe in.</p> <p>At the moment, the message on education is muddled. A huge transformation has been made in schools since 1997, thanks to increased funding, new building, the primary strategies, better teacher training and a focus on school leadership. Steadily rising achievement and the increased aspiration of many young people to go on to higher education bear this out, as do more favourable international comparisons.</p> <p>But the woolly briefing about choice and wooing middle-class parents from the private sector that accompanied the publication of the recent Five-Year Strategy have left many parents cynical and confused and the party's natural supporters fuming.</p> <p>One could argue that the considerable achievements so far should form the basis for an election campaign, but apparently that \"consolidation\" approach (unless, of course, we are consolidating the policies of the late Tory government rather than our own) is very unfashionable with the powers that be in government.</p> <p>In one sense they are right. An extension of the steady-as-we-go investment approach alone won't adequately address the enduring gap in achievement by social class in this country, which drags down overall achievement and discourages the sort of social cohesion we all want to see.</p> <p>What is needed after the Five-Year Strategy has been put quietly to the back of the filing cabinet - having served its purpose in proving there is life after Iraq - is a more coherent, radical blueprint that will make sense to the public rather than just excite the commentators; one that fleshes out the good proposals on early years, childcare and post-16, while ironing out the contradictions between choice and selection, independence and community, personalisation and prescription running through the proposed school reforms.</p> <p>First into the recycling bin must be the overused but under-defined rhetoric about choice, about which the electorate appears to be much more hard-headed than the politicians. Parents rightly want the chance to express a preference about which school their children should attend. To a certain extent competition for school places has helped to drive up standards.</p> <p>However, most parents understand that, with a highly prescriptive curriculum driven by tests and exams, the difference between what schools are offering, even if they specialise, is marginal. Conditioned by the league tables to believe we should be seeking a standard model of academic success for our children, rather than a personalised or diverse one (which is why you rarely hear people saying they are choosing a school at the bottom of the league table because it is good at textile design or food technology), we know the real choice is between good and bad schools according to a definition laid down by successive governments.</p> <p>For all of us to get into the very good schools they would probably have to double or treble in size, which is undesirable as well as financially and physically impossible in many cases. So some people will have to go to the less good ones. Absolute choice is an illusion and the authors of a third-term manifesto should be honest about this if they want to regain trust from a cynical electorate.</p> <p>Using instead the language of preference, they need to come up with bold proposals to enable more parents to exercise that preference, which will usually be for a good school close to where they live, in a fair and transparent system that gives them some certainty about the outcome.</p> <p>The Commons education select committee's report on school admissions states bluntly what parents already know: the current system, embracing a wild array of different admissions criteria, is a mess, beneficial to the most knowing and affluent, but often frustrating, opaque and time-consuming for the rest.</p> <p>Reforming a system in which, as the select committee concludes, \"fairness is a matter of luck rather than a matter of course\", and which routinely allows some schools to keep out children they don't want to teach, should be a source of pride in the third term and at the heart of the manifesto.</p> <p>This would mean quietly dropping the idea that new independent state secondary schools could set their own admissions criteria. But it would reinforce rather than undermine other existing commitments to put schools at the heart of their communities. And it would help to smooth the transition between primary and secondary school, back up the Children's Bill proposals for the most vulnerable young people, and, crucially, enhance progress on standards for the most challenging pupils by giving them an entitlement to the schools that are currently the preserve of the most socially and academically desirable.</p> <p>But admissions alone won't solve the problem. Poverty, poor housing and nutrition blight children's chances - but parental education, particularly that of mothers, and their involvement in their children's learning are increasingly being linked to a child's prospects in life. Young people whose parents can neither work the admissions system nor effectively support them at school are doubly disadvantaged.</p> <p>Compensating for that will cost money - not just in extended schools, family learning schemes, better communication of basic information about the curriculum, and help with homework and coursework, but in training heads and teachers how to work with parents rather than see them as passive partners, or even opponents.</p> <p>Taking a firm lead on school meals with higher minimum nutritional standards, a ban on vending machines and some form of objective external inspection, which could then be included in the new school profiles, would cheer up most parents and help the least well-off children.</p> <p>But, above all, schools need a cadre of extra adults in classroom and mentoring roles to give attention and support to children who can't rely on it at home, and to act as advocates for them in the way our own, more privileged children take for granted. A truly personalised service.</p> <p>The recent three-year budgets and one-size-fits-all minimum levels of funding per child are welcome on a school planning level. But they could leave little room for manoeuvre for schools or local authorities to target money to those who really need it when financial constraints loom.</p> <p>And while it is hard to quarrel with the idea of investing heavily in urban areas of high deprivation, as Peter Lampl pointed out on these pages last month, it is too early to say how effective ploughing huge sums of taxpayers' money into city academies will be, and what benefit (if any) will be felt by children in neighbouring schools that don't benefit from similar investment.</p> <p>Rather than expand the number of these schools, the academy programme should be halted until the government's own evaluation of their effectiveness has been completed, in three years' time. In the meantime, the money should be redistributed more evenly between schools, and the academies' unaccountable systems of governance, which give disproportionate control in perpetuity to sponsors who contribute a small fraction of their total cost, should be overhauled.</p> <p>New Labour was founded on the idea of politics for the many not the few, building on traditional values of equality of opportunity. In the first term, we managed to capture the public's imagination with policies that articulated those values. But over time, the government's clear message about \"standards not structures\" and \"opportunity for all\" seems to have dissolved into a messy compromise between a bit of opportunity for all but with special arrangements and better schools for some.</p> <p>In the end, politics is about priorities. You can't please all the people all the time. Middle-class parents are important, but not all middle-class parents want to grab their vouchers and run to independent schools or to poor copies in the state sector.</p> <p>Cracking the cycle of poverty and underachievement must be central to the third term if we are really to overcome antisocial behaviour, crime and teenage pregnancy, and their huge costs in the welfare and criminal justice systems, which affect us all.</p> <p>And if we really want to attract back the minority of parents who decide to use the independent sector, we could get rid of the subsidy of charitable status, put VAT on school fees and let the market, so prevalent elsewhere in education policy, do the work for us.</p> <p>In my 14 years as a parent of school-age children, I have lived in a London borough with a mix of good community comprehensives and a sizeable exit to the private sector. I know many of the sort of middle-class parents the government has in mind. As our children hit public exams and university entrance, the difference in academic outcomes has been minimal. Most have achieved well and are going on to higher education regardless of which school they attended and the choices we made as parents.</p> <p>The truth is that middle-class children from supportive, aspirant homes are doing fine on the whole. Indeed, as a nation we are sending so many of them to university that we can hardly afford to pay for it.</p> <p>The touchstone for me of whether our policies are succeeding or failing is a boy who started secondary school at the same time as my son but from a background that has included time in care, periods of mobility between schools and school refusal. For him, aged 16, with minimal qualifications and having fallen through the social services and Connexions safety nets, opportunities are limited and the concept of choice meaningless.</p> <p>Rather than worrying about what the leader writers will say, or whether the direction appears modern or consolidating, old or new, or left or right, we should be thinking as much about young people like him as the urban affluent class - and be brave enough to articulate policies that will actually work, make a lasting difference and prove that every child really does matter.</p> <p><strong>Millar's manifesto: what Labour should do next</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Clarify the message on education with more emphasis on our achievements, standards and leadership teaching, and less on structures</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Be realistic about the limits of choice.

  "Scientists have unveiled a new hi-tech weapon to help combat the illegal trade of ivory in Africa: a map. <p>The map describes how the genetic profiles of African elephants vary across the continent, from the dense forests of western and central Africa to the vast eastern savanna. </p> <p>The team behind the map, headed by Samuel Wasser, a biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, says it can be used to verify where collections of ivory originated, by allowing police and customs officers to link stocks of tusks to herds known to live in a specific region. </p> <p>It could also help alert officials to the emergence of poaching hotspots, where law enforcement needs to be bolstered. </p> <p>Prof Wasser and his team visited sites in 16 African countries where most of the elephant population roams, and collected DNA from droppings and skin tissue. The DNA was analysed to identify key sequences of genetic code that distinguish one group of elephants from another. </p> <p>Using a computer model, the team was then able to work out the likely genetic make-up of elephants in other parts of Africa and so build up a map of the elephants' genetic diversity. </p> <p>Using the map, officials could ascertain the origin of tusks in national stockpiles or from intercepted consignments by simply taking DNA samples, a procedure that costs around \u00a360, and checking them against the map. The team, whose work appears today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that continent-wide the system could place half of all ivory within 300 miles of its origin, though accuracy varied from region to region, improving to within 84 miles in west Africa. </p> <p>The map could have the biggest impact on poaching in African forests. While elephant numbers are easy to track in the open savannas, populations and poachers are tougher to monitor in the forests. </p> <p>\"My colleagues working in the forests are saying 'there are no elephants left here',\" said Prof Wasser. \"In the forest, you don't notice the change in population until it's so dramatic that it's almost too late to do anything about it.\" </p> <p>The African elephant population dropped by 60% between 1979 and 1987, from 1.3m to 500,000, largely because of ivory poachers. </p> <p>Although an international ban on ivory trading was passed in 1989, the three largest hauls of ivory, one of which amouned to around 6.5 tonnes, have occurred in the past two years. </p> <p>In 2002, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa were granted permission to have one-off sales of legally acquired ivory. Next week, Namibia will petition the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Wild Fauna and Flora to approve an annual quota of raw ivory sales of two tonnes a year. </p> <p>Julian Blanc, of the World Conservation Union's African elephant specialist group in Nairobi, believes the genetic map could one day become a valuable tool in clamping down on the illegal trade of tusks. </p> <p>He said: \"Right now, it's probably not precise enough because it might not tell us if a consignment comes from one side of a national border or the other. But if it can be improved, it would be able to help verify whether ivory has been acquired legally and comes from the region they claim.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the higher education bill was going through parliament earlier this year, Tony Blair repeatedly stressed there was no Plan B. It was top-up fees or nothing. As the bill barely scraped through its second reading, by just five votes, you can put the prime minister's decision down to either astute political brinkmanship or extreme foolhardiness. It certainly wasn't standard business practice.</p> <p>This month the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and the Student Loans Company (SLC) have shown a little more savvy, and have prepared contingency plans for any students receiving their loan cheques late at the beginning of term. And it's just as well. Despite a strongly worded statement sent out last week - \"Our expectation remains that all students who have applied correctly and on time, will be paid on time\" - the Guardian has learned that between 12,000 and 25,000 returning students are expected to receive their money late.</p> <p>It might well have been a great deal worse. Earlier this year there were serious glitches in the new Protocol computer software, introduced by the SLC and DfES to centralise the loans applications procedure and speed up the process. Reports of meltdown proved to be exaggerated, but the system was creaking under the pressure and a process that was supposed to be completed in just three weeks was taking seven weeks or more.</p> <p>The SLC now says all computer problems have been ironed out. \"The new single computer system has been meticulously planned over several phases during a two-year period,\" it says, \"and was subjected to a rigorous testing schedule which was deliberately diagnostic, rather than responding to system faults only after they occurred. As with every new system, improvements have been required but these have been quickly implemented through collaborative hard work. The system did have teething problems in May and June, but these have now been addressed.\"</p> <p>This is news to Malcolm Grimston, the cabinet member for education in Wandsworth, who was one of the first to draw public attention to the problems. The council first alerted ministers in June and the warnings were repeated in August. Its experience has been that the system has been extremely slow, has constantly broken down and on numerous occasions has been totally inaccessible.</p> <p>\"There were a few improvements up until the start of the new school term,\" says Grimston, \"but since then the system has slowed down again.\" Wandsworth maintains it has worked round the clock to ensure all its students will be paid on time, and is at pains to point out it is not down to the SLC that this has been achieved. \"This has been a race against time,\" Grimston continues. \"It's only thanks to the commitment and forward planning of staff in our student finance team that we have been able to make up the lost time caused by repeated breakdowns in the SLC's software.\"</p> <p>The National Union of Students (NUS) was so concerned about the situation that it requested - and got - a meeting with the DfES and SLC at the end of August. At this meeting it was agreed that loans to first-year students should be prioritised and that, as in other years, anyone applying late should be dealt with last.</p> <p>It is with the middle group of returning students that the trouble lies. The SLC believes all first-year students will be paid on time, and there is no reason to doubt them. But between 12,500 and 25,000 returning students are expected to fall under the net and become liable for the contingency plans that have been put in place.</p> <p>Any student whose form cannot be processed in time will be given an interim payment of \u00a31,000, or one-third of the amount requested, whichever is the lower. This payment will not be subject to the normal means-testing procedures, and any over- or under-payment will be rectified in the future. It is estimated that interim payments will be made within four to five working days of student registration, and that it will take a further two to four weeks to process the full student support payment.</p> <p>However, any supplementary grants, such as the childcare grant and the disabled students allowance, will not be issued alongside the interim payment. Although local education authorities have been asked to prioritise students with disabilities and/or dependants, there are no guarantees this will happen in every case.</p> <p>The DfES points out that the situation is not a national problem. \"There are just a few LEAs experiencing difficulties,\" said a spokesperson, \"and it is only to students from these authorities that interim payments will need to be made.\" The DfES is unwilling to say precisely which LEAs are affected. \"We don't want to cause any unnecessary panic. It's far more important that LEAs should be left alone to process any remaining applications quickly, than to run the risk of constant interruptions from anxious students.\"</p> <p>The universities have also been heavily involved with the contingency plans. \"At present we have no reason to believe that any of our students will be affected,\" says Michael Driscoll, vice-chancellor of Middlesex University. \"But we have received a letter from the DfES asking us to use our Access for Learning funds to make bridging loans to any student who may be facing financial difficulties. We have also been asked not to press students to pay their rent for halls of residence before all loans payments have been cleared.\"</p> <p>This is all good sensible stuff, but as no one is being told precisely which LEAs are in trouble, it is impossible to tell whether the provision is adequate. It appears likely that some institutions may come off relatively unscathed while others are disproportionately affected.</p> <p>In these cases, the NUS is concerned about whether there will be sufficient discretionary funds in the Access to Learning kitty to meet student demand. No additional funding has been allocated to institutions either to administer the funds or to meet the potential additional demand, and the DfES has been unable to give the NUS any guarantees that the funds will meet this demand, or to provide an estimate of the likely demand.</p> <p>\"Situations such as this only serve to highlight the potential for problems that exists within the current financial packages available to students,\" says the NUS president, Cat Fletcher. \"Once again, this is an example of how students from a less privileged background could be left compromised if they have no one to bail them out financially.</p> <p>\"The only way to achieve true parity and access to education for all is to bring back government-funded grants, which would enable everyone to attend further education without having to struggle to stay afloat.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, everyone else is left crossing their fingers and hoping for the best. University terms have a staggered start, and the SLC is making an effort to prioritise institutions that return earliest. So it's not necessarily bad news for those students who have not yet received confirmation of their loan payments.</p> <p>On the other hand, it's not necessarily good news either. As one insider says, \"We'll just have to wait until all the students have returned to find out just how effective the contingency plans have been.\"</p> <p>Let's hope there's no need for Plan C.</p> <p><strong>Why three into two doesn't go</strong></p> <p><strong>By John Crace and John Martin</strong></p> <p>More than 90,000 Scottish students are also facing financial hardship, as a result of changes in the structure of the academic year. Many Scottish universities are switching from the traditional three-term year to two longer semesters. At Edinburgh, the first term, which usually lasts for 10 weeks, will now run for 13 weeks.</p> <p>These changes have not been matched by comparable adjustments to the dates on which student loan payments are made. This means students will have to get by for 13 weeks on funds that were earmarked for just 10. In some cases, students will not be able to access the final third of their loan until just six weeks before the end of the academic year.</p> <p>The Edinburgh University student union has pointed out that the first loan instalment would leave Edinburgh students with about \u00a362.50 a week - less than the cheapest university rent. The chairman of the Coalition of Higher Education Students in Scotland and president of the Edinburgh NUS, Steve Cockburn, believes a more flexible system of nine monthly payments is needed.</p> <p>\"It is unacceptable that bureaucratic rigidity and inertia should claim priority over the needs of almost 100,000 students in Scotland, who are being failed by the student support system,\" he said. \"The DfES needs to focus some of its attention north of the border and act to prevent what could be serious, but unnecessary, student hardship.\"</p> <p>The Student Loans Company argues that whatever it might like to do, its hands are currently tied. \"The SLC is not empowered to implement any changes of its own accord and must be given ministerial instructions for any such alteration of the status quo,\" a spokesperson said.</p> <p>\"Technically, it would be possible for separate arrangements to be made by the SLC to alter payment dates for different educational institutions, but such arrangements would take a significant amount of time to put in place. In any event, even an immediate instruction would take some months to implement. If any such change is called for, the SLC will readily and happily comply.\"</p> <p>Over to the DfES.</p>",
  "<p>The idea that play is a powerful way of learning is nothing new. Animals play to learn. Teachers have used games in education since way back when. So it is hardly surprising that the enormous didactic potential of computer games was spotted almost as soon as they were invented.</p> <p>However, much educational use of computer games to date has been a hit- and-miss affair. Despite the fact that they have been around for nearly half a century, surprisingly little is known about computer games in general and why, in particular, they are such effective teaching aides.</p> <p>\"When it comes to serious detailed understanding of computer games we have only just begun to scratch the surface,\" says Diane Carr of the London Knowledge Lab, a joint venture between the Institute of Education and Birkbeck College. \"The critical vocabulary is only now being put together and computer game theory itself is only a couple of years old.\"</p> <p>This is set to change over the next three years with a study aimed at establishing exactly what it is that makes computer games so compulsive and motivating - and hence so useful in teaching and training.</p> <p>The research, which will be carried out at the London Knowledge Lab, funded by a \u00a3150,000 grant from educational charity Eduserve, will be much more than a donnish inquiry into an interesting topical phenomenon.</p> <p>It will aim to answer questions such as how the more positive features of computer gaming, such as collaboration, experimentation and deep engagement, can be incorporated into teaching. What are the implications of online multi-player games for distance learning? What are the links between motivation and game play, collaboration and participation?</p> <p>\"The starting point is the obvious power that computer games have to obsess people,\" says Stephen Butcher, chief executive of Eduserve. But the outcome should have concrete educational applications. \"We want to look beyond the stereotypes of computer games, to accelerate their development as useful educational tools.\"</p> <p>A real problem with computer games is that because they are so ubiquitous, we think we know all about them. In fact, much of what we think we know is just wrong, and much of the rest is too shallow to be useful. Take even elementary questions, such as which is the world's favourite game, who plays it and why?</p> <p>\"The cliche is that the typical gamer is an alienated teenage nerd who spends hours alone in his bedroom playing at murder and mayhem. In fact, the most popular computer games in the world are online puzzles or card games, played by older women or retired people who like their sociability and value the fact that it keeps them alert,\" says Carr. \"We need an analytical tool set that will help us to develop effective educational games or to better incorporate existing games into differing educational contexts.\"</p> <p>Her research will be two-pronged. First it will look at the subjective experience of play. \"We will be trying to understand how it feels to play. We'll be investigating motivation in terms of the various pleasurable states said to be evoked by digital games, such as immersion, engagement, control and exploration. Then we'll look at the cultural and social contexts of motivation.\"</p> <p>In particular, Carr will be investigating the gender aspects of computer gaming. The assumption, she says, is that girls don't like computer gaming very much, except for family games like The Sims.</p> <p>Early studies of a computer gaming club in south London revealed this just isn't true: \"These girls are clearly fascinated by a wide range of games. You can't help feeling that, in large part, gaming preferences are determined by what you had access to.\"</p> <p>Early evidence is, however, that girls do use computer games differently from boys.</p> <p>\"The girls we studied were enjoying a wide variety of games and using them in different ways - as a backdrop to play with friends. They were happily passing the controls around to each other when there were just girls present. When the group is mixed sex, the girls are much more cautious.\"</p> <p>The outcome, says Butcher, will be to make educational software that is more motivating and pedagogically sound. Or, to put it in lay terms: \"It will close the gap between the sexy and the worthy in computer games.\"</p>",
  "<p>Once upon a time you could escape the school bullies when you reached the safety of your own home. Now, not even a bolted front door can keep them out. </p> <p>They've found a new tool - the internet message board. A recent case has involved students from some 20 state and independent schools in north London. They have been acting as webmasters or sending and receiving offensive content posted on a series of messageboards.</p> <p> The results have spilled over into school time, leaving a very upset group of teenagers and some worried parents. Two sites quoted by teachers are www.mouth2mouth.tk and www.whatyousayin.tk, which carry the full names of many students and enough information for anyone to identify and potentially locate them. </p> <p>Discussions on the boards include alleged sexual encounters, whether students as young as 11 are sexually attractive, and comments on deemed physical faults and drug use. </p> <p>\"Partly this is kids being kids, but this forum is causing severe grief,\" says a senior teacher at one of the affected schools. \"It's all the usual adolescent fantasies, but by naming people it feeds back into school life. Because all the posts are anonymous, it encourages the most horrific, gross comments. Students even take on the identities of others who have been gossiped about and reply to posts as if they were them.\" </p> <p>It is a simple process for budding young webmasters to set up a similar message forum. In the case of mouth2mouth-style sites, students are able to download Canadian-based Atomic Boards' software for free, which provides them with a message board template. </p> <p>The Canadian authorities have no control over who controls a message board. As in this country, the emphasis is more on whether the content contravenes any local laws, in which case the internet service provider (ISP) supporting the site must be notified. The ISP will then contact the offending site's webmasters, who must take action by removing the offensive or illegal content, or potentially face closure. </p> <p>Atomic Boards enables students to customise the software and recommends domain names ending with .tk, which the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) has traced to the Netherlands. The webmasters then choose an ISP, which can host a site from a server anywhere in the world. </p> <p>The foundation says the ISP hosting a website is not responsible for content. For UK watchdogs to take sites down, the ISP must be notified that content is illegal and it must be hosting a UK-based site. However, neither of these criteria apply in this case, says the teacher.</p> <p> \"The site seems to be registered to a small island off the coast of New Zealand.\" The webmasters are largely English teenagers aged 13-15, and under UK law the content of the sites is not illegal. </p> <p>\"There doesn't seem to be the framework in British law, so what the heck can you do?\" the teacher says. \"It is difficult to get a company on the other side of the world that has no liability under UK law to help.\" </p> <p>So what can schools do? This teacher's school became aware of trouble stemming from a site when a fight broke out at school because of posted comments. After searching the site in question, the school told any students that could be identified to stop using the site or face expulsion - a warning they took seriously. </p> <p>It also asked form tutors to talk to pupils in tutorial lessons about the site and verbal bullying, in an adult and discursive manner, so as to encourage them to consider the question of personal responsibility. The school also wrote a letter to the webmaster and the ISP, detailing the abuse.</p> <p> \"The service provider took the site off line for 24 hours while the webmasters took the worst of the abuse off, but then it went back up again, with a changed disclaimer that covers the webmasters' back.\" </p> <p>Two other north London schools also contacted the ISP and webmasters but took different approaches. The head at one school wrote to all parents urging them to look at the site with their children and to calmly discuss the issues it brought up. This approach achieved good results, with the school receiving numerous phone calls from supportive parents. Students who had been bullied through the sites spoke to their teachers, expressing relief that the school and their parents had got involved. </p> <p>Students at another school were not involved in postings on the site, although they were often referred to in the offensive gossip of others. </p> <p>\"The mouth2mouth site is bullying in a whole new realm,\" says the school's head. \"We've been working with our lawyers to get the site closed down, or at least make it difficult for them to operate and to remove all references to our school. I've worked very closely with parents and we also spoke to the police. Unfortunately, mouth2mouth is not unique.\" </p> <p>Thanks to the involvement of this school's lawyers and the collective action of all the schools referred to on the messageboards, the names and nicknames of the schools have at least been removed from the mouth2mouth.tk site. </p> <p>However, because the webmasters have been unable to control the bullying nature of the postings on mouth2 mouth, in the middle of last month they closed the site down. In a statement on the site they said that this had been done \"due to the excessive amount of 'bitchin', slander and abuse found on the message board\". </p> <p>Liz Carnell, spokeswoman for Bullying Online has issued a statement on the mouth2 mouth.tk site on the seriousness of online bullying. </p> <p>It includes a warning to others who decide to start their own message board or post offensive messages on one: \"If you make repeated offensive postings, or invite others to do so, you could be breaking two laws. One is the Harassment Act 1997 and the other is the Telecommunications Act 1984.\" </p> <p>She also stressed that no posting is truly anonymous, as police are able to trace the internet protocol (IP) address of each computer used to post a message, which acts like a digital fingerprint. </p> <p>\"It's up to schools to get a grip on the issue in this electronic age,\" warns John Carr, internet adviser to the charity, National Children's Homes. \"[Schools have] a pastoral responsibility to deal with it, because it is having consequences in school by affecting the quality of life for pupils, even though the bullying does not take place on school grounds.\" </p> <p>Michelle Elliot, director of bullying aid charity Kidscape, advises teachers to offer rewards for information on who is posting gossip anonymously and to send letters to parents requesting better web supervision. Meanwhile, the north London teacher believes legislation is the key. Internet watchdogs need to be given the power to monitor and take down sites that allow verbal bullying. </p> <p>\"Clearly this is a matter for public concern,\" he says. \"There isn't an easy manner of redress for anyone who has something written about them on a board. There is no clear legislation to deal with it. A watchdog is required that can say this constitutes verbal bullying, so that it will be taken off the internet.\"</p>",
  "<p>The long-standing dispute over schools' freedom to use the latest wireless technology is over - for now. In some areas, schools had held back from installing wireless systems, and software manufacturers were wary of investing in new products because of the dispute, which went to the high court earlier this year. But the chancery court has now delivered its judgment on Frontline Technologies v the Department for Education and Skills. </p> <p>The DfES challenge was to a patent held by Frontline, one of a group of companies controlled by London businessman Ali Guryel. The patent dates from 1992 and deals with the technology of electronic registration. Guryel also controls Bromcom, which sells an electronic registration system based on the patent. But the development of wireless LANs meant other companies were keen to adapt their products to provide e-registration. </p> <p>Guryel wrote to competitors reminding them that a patent existed on the transfer of pupil data over a wireless network. Frontline offered to sell a licence to schools that bought technologies that infringed the patent, a move that precipitated the legal challenge by the DfES. </p> <p>In November 2002, the DfES took expert legal advice and wrote to all local authorities advising LEAs and schools not to take out the Frontline licence. The \"expert legal advice\" referred to a system at Solihull's Kingshurst city technology college in the early 1990s. This transmitted pupil data over a network and predated the Frontline patent. In the complex world of patent law this is called \"prior art\" and invalidates a patent. </p> <p>Chancery court judge David Young QC accepted the DfES claim about Kingshurst, but he did not totally revoke the patent. Frontline's claim to have invented a novel means of passing block data over a wireless network was upheld, and the company now intends to amend its original patent. </p> <p>But the DfES is convinced the judgment draws a line under the dispute. It is certain wireless technology meeting Wi-Fi standards is safe from any patent challenge. </p> <p>The Guardian checked the DfES view with a senior figure in a midlands NGfL team, who says the 802.11 standards, on which Wi-Fi is based, apply to the equipment used in the vast majority of UK schools. </p> <p>\"It is the one people would be offered if they were buying wireless networking equipment. I'd say this means Frontline and Bromcom are stuffed on their claims,\" he said. </p>",
  "<p>Counting to four in French, defining where you can find God, or putting maths to practical use solving money problems... none of them would star as the number one conversation topic in most school playgrounds.</p> <p>But up in Stoke-on-Trent, these rather diverse topics are beginning to buck the trend thanks to a digital video initiative devised by Jenny Hulme, an ICT advisory teacher for the town's Rainbow Education Action Zone.</p> <p>The goal of the \"engaged learning project\" is to let primary school pupils loose with cameras and digital editing equipment. The idea arose during a summer school that Hulme ran in 2002. \"The children were making autobiographical films and, as part of that, were talking about the subjects they hated at school. This got me thinking about how DV could enliven such disliked bits of the curriculum.\"</p> <p>Thanks to a longstanding link with Apple UK, Hulme had already run DV training sessions for primaries in the action zone, including use of iMovie editing software. She selected six of the schools that attended and asked them to gather small groups of children willing to take on the project after school. Both teachers and budding filmmakers then attended a day's training in camera techniques and editing at Longton City Learning Centre.</p> <p>\"It was such a thrill to watch the children so quickly grasp how to handle the technology in a creative way,\" says Hulme. \"DV is a great leveller.\"</p> <p>More than one \"difficult pupil\" came into their own while making these films and all felt engaged with what they were learning. \"The best thing is being involved in the filming, in the editing and even moving the models. It takes concentration and patience,\" says Daisy Holliday, 11, of Oakhill school and the joint creator of an animation encouraging younger pupils to count in French.</p> <p>Among the lessons learnt was the need to gear the films to specific audiences - often younger children at their own schools.</p> <p>\"The process got them thoroughly immersed in their topic,\" says Sarah Thursfield, deputy head of Christchurch primary school, where they made a film exploring the differences between solids, liquids and gasses. \"This is a topic that is hard to put across interestingly in class. But through film-making, they came into their own - teaching each other and working well as a team.\"</p> <p>Such knock-on benefits should secure DV a more permanent fixture in UK classrooms, and Hulme points out the immediate curriculum enhancement the technology brings. \"The Christchurch team proved to me the power of DV in helping children get to grips with topics they don't much like. I'm sure they will pass their SATs in this section brilliantly - by the end they knew every fact by heart. Not only did they have to speak it to a camera, but they heard the material over and over again during the editing stage.\"</p> <p>Film has a \"wow factor\", says Jean Coker, IT coordinator at St Luke's, Hanley. \"The boys involved were proud, though it was telling that their accounts of the project to parents emphasised the film-making over the poetic subject matter of their movie. For me, this is teaching as I have never taught before. It is essential to keep youngsters excited, and DV has that capacity. It may be something new for teachers to consider, but it should not be regarded as an extra burden but a tremendous tool.\"</p> <p> <strong>How schools are teaching with DV ...</strong></p> <p><strong>Bishop Stamer primary</strong><br>Maths R Us - solving money problems</p> <p>\"The pupils had to think about a far broader range of things than just the maths associated with various practical money problems,\" says ICT co-ordinator Gary Kanes. \"They had to consider how others would see them and how to communicate clearly. It greatly helped boost the confidence of the more shy ones.\"</p> <p><strong>Christchurch CofE primary</strong><br>Solids, liquids and gases</p> <p>The team used the BBC Revise Wise site in their planning. This enabled them to get their facts right and it suggested the blend of drama and filmed evidence for the montages. \"An important tip is to invest in a tripod,\" suggests deputy head Sarah Thursfield. \"It only takes a bit of camera shake to make a film look amateurish.\"</p> <p><strong>Harpfield primary school</strong><br>Where do I find my God?</p> <p>The film supplies a montage of images as its answer to this significant question. The biggest challenge was selecting a series of religious artefacts and symbols to film, and in doing so, the children emphasised Harpfield's ethnic and cultural mix of pupils. This is something that has broadened greatly over recent years.</p> <p><strong>Oakhill primary</strong><br>Un, deux, trois, quatre</p> <p>The Oakhill film club group used iStopMotion software to catch the movement of various clay creations and then pulled these images into iMovie to add soundtrack and credits. The film features dancing frogs and baguettes. There were plenty of problems working with clay actors. \"You had to be careful not to twist them too hard,\" says Natasha Roberts, 11.</p> <p><strong>St Luke's, Hanley</strong><br>St Luke's poem</p> <p>The film emerged from plans to link IT and literacy at key stage 2 by ICT coordinator, Jean Coker. \"We learnt how important it is to be disciplined. Without control it's easy to film far too much. But the biggest challenge was synchronising recorded sound and images. We learnt how to extend film sequences so that the timing could be perfect.\"</p> <p><strong>Willows primary school</strong><br>Time Trackers</p> <p>The project enabled the team to return to the Hart's Hill area of Stoke - usually the site of the school's geography fieldwork. \"A key tip for school DV work is the need for teachers to show examples of the kind of film you hope they will make,\" says ICT coordinator Linda Neat. \"It's also a good idea not to rely on a camera's microphone to pick up sound.\"</p>",
  "<p>Nine-year-old Tom (not his real name) was a stubborn under-achiever when he started year five at English Martyrs school in Liverpool. His writing was well below average and his concentration and attitude towards work were poor. Rather than imagine his own stories, he would lift ideas from TV shows and could not manage more than two or three paragraphs. </p> <p>\"He was wayward - not disruptive but unmotivated,\" says teacher Lewis Dinsdale. \"His stories lacked originality.\" </p> <p>English Martyrs is a member of the Janus networked learning community (NLC), a group of 10 schools in Sefton LEA on Merseyside that collaborate, sharing ideas, swapping good practice, observing and evaluating each other's lessons and undertaking joint research or teaching and learning projects. </p> <p>Dinsdale's class was involved in an email story-writing project with nearby St Monica's RC primary in which the children co-wrote stories based on Greek myths. Children in one school would come up with a beginning and then email it to their \"buddy\" at the other school to plot the next part. </p> <p>\"Tom got really interested in the stories and would actually be running into class to check the emails from the other school,\" says Dinsdale. \"For all the children, one of the attractions seemed to be that, by writing emails to kids in another school, they weren't actually working at writing; it was fun.\" </p> <p>Other joint projects included making a short film, which brought in vocabulary such as \"editing\", \"cutting\" and \"scene\" as well as powerful verbs to describe characters' emotions. </p> <p>Tom was given responsibility for editing and sending material to St Monica's. By the end of the year Tom's attainment and confidence had soared. From being at level 2, he is on course for level 4 in his SATs, if not 5, says Dinsdale. </p> <p>\"There has been a tremendous improvement in his written work, his vocabulary and his motivation, but he always had the potential. Working on these collaborative projects using ICT has helped us to bring it out.\" </p> <p>Networked learning, though, is about more than improving test scores. Colin Richardson, ICT coordinator at St Monica's, says: \"One of the success criteria we had was, once the formal network project is over, would you carry on with the work? We've all agreed we would. We are in our second year now and have all gone back to the methods we used last year because we know they work. And that to us is more valuable and meaningful than saying a child's test scores have gone up two levels.\" </p> <p><strong> The Networked Learning Communities programme</strong></p> <p> The NLC programme was launched in September 2002 and there are now 130 around the country involving 1,500 schools. They are funded by the Department for Education and Skills and monitored and promoted through the National College for School Leadership. Each chooses an area to focus on - an aspect of the curriculum, a theme such as boys' attainment or emotional intelligence, or a management or professional development topic - and the teachers meet regularly to discuss progress, hold joint training days and carry out research, aiming to tap into expertise in each of the schools. </p> <p>Apart from the specific objectives, schools are also finding networking is adding a new dimension to ICT work and helping to embed its use in the curriculum, particularly where the NLC focus is pupil learning. </p> <p><strong> 'I like learning from other children '</strong> </p> <p>Larkrise lower school in Dunstable is one of 28 schools in the Bedfordshire Schools Improvement Partnership NLC, split between two urban areas of Bedfordshire. Children are involved in United, a scheme looking at how ICT can be used in class and homework to improve teaching and learning. </p> <p>They look at what, in their opinion, makes an effective ICT lesson and post their ideas on the United website. </p> <p>Eight-year-old Larelle Hathaway explains: \"United has its own website and we email people in the other schools to update them on new things we've learned. We also look at things such as how to use certain websites, what chatrooms you might run into and how to be safe on the internet.\" </p> <p>She likes the idea of learning from other children. \"If you have a problem - if you don't know how some software works - you can go on the website or email somebody at another school and they try to help you.\" </p> <p>Teacher Marcus Ray, who is helping to develop the NLC for the school, points out the practical advantages of a network, such as buying and developing resources jointly. It also gives access to new skills. </p> <p>\"You don't have to have high-end expertise yourself. You can use the resources the community has provided and build your skills and knowledge from there.\" </p> <p>There is even a financial ad vantage in that software companies often give discounts to groups of schools, he adds. </p> <p><strong> 'Students are motivated by work that's real'</strong></p> <p> At Penryn college in Cornwall, the 30 mixed-age tutor groups spent a day putting together cross-curricular teaching aids for the primary schools in their network, the Penryn Partnership. The day was planned in consultation with the primary teachers and groups focused on different aspects of the curriculum using ICT as the medium. </p> <p>One group produced an electronic storybook on the Mousehole Cat, a Cornish folk story, done in PowerPoint. Others produced a quiz to support numeracy, with cards and rules designed on computer, printed out and laminated; websites; and games incorporating video clips and sound effects. Everything was handed to the primary schools for use and feedback. </p> <p>Giving the college students an authentic audience for their work is one of the chief advantages of the network, says Peter Martin, the college's head of ICT. </p> <p>\"One of the things that motivated the children was that they were producing real resources that would be used by other children, not just something that would sit in a folder.\" </p> <p>College head Marie Hunter says the project focused on learning needs in all the schools but also expanded the teachers' knowledge of the students' ICT capabilities. </p> <p>\"It astounded some of us that the children had the skills to produce work of such professional quality. </p> <p>\"The other amazing thing was how absorbed the children became in the work. At the end of the day they all assembled in the hall to do PowerPoint presentations, but then we couldn't get rid of them!\" <strong> 'Collaborating rekindles teachers' enthusiasm'</strong> </p> <p>At Thomas Hardye school in Dorchester (part of the Dorchester Area Schools Improve ment Partnership NLC), advanced skills teacher Chris Drew works with the network's first and middle schools, training staff to use ICT in science. </p> <p>It can range from the basics of how to find and paste images from the net to how to create an interactive questionnaire on respiration using PowerPoint. Drew has also introduced Hot Potatoes, a free downloadable program for making interactive quizzes, multiple-choice questionnaires and web pages that don't require HTML skills. </p> <p>The work includes producing video clips of chemistry demonstrations for teachers and students to share with other schools in the network. </p> <p>\"The teachers find working together invaluable because they feed off each other, not only from me, and it definitely seems to have rekindled enthusiasm,\" says Drew. \"They're also attempting things they wouldn't have before and they're making a resource they can take back into school.\" </p> <p><strong>Feedback channels go online to all</strong></p> <p> The National College for School Leadership has launched Learning Exchange Online, featuring a weblog where teachers will be posting their experiences of working in networks. It also includes research results and resources they have used and devised. </p> <p>\"It will make the work of the networks open to all. Not only will people be able to post the results of their work but others can build on it,\" says Gene Payne, operational director for Networked Learning Group at the college. Go to <a href=\"http://www.nlcexchange.org.uk\">www.nlcexchange.org.uk</a>. </p> <p>Funding for the NLC programme has now ceased, although existing funding arrangments will continue until 2006. In the five-year strategy for schools announced this summer, education secretary Charles Clarke effectively handed the baton for supporting collaborative work to local education authorities, stressing all primaries should be entitled to be in a network. </p> <p>\"There is this myth that in the 60s teachers got together to work but that it had no rigour. There was definitely a need to counter that sense that collaborative processes cannot be disciplined,\" says Payne. </p> <p>Cheering for number crunchers is the research by NCSL that shows collaborative work has a definite impact on tests. Like the teachers, however, Payne is quick to stress that focusing on bald statistics misses the point. </p> <p>\"We have done an analysis of the key stage 2 2004 results comparing NLC schools and others nationally. Early analysis indicates better results for key stage 2 in NLCs than the national average. </p> <p>\"However, this is about deep-seated improvement. The power of the network in many ways is that the expertise in the system is extended further and so the benefits to children's learning are greater.\" </p> <p>Learning Exchange Online: <a href=\"http://www.nlcexchange.org.uk\">www.nlcexchange.org.uk</a> </p>",
  "<p>It's playtime at the Wren's Nest in Dudley. Children at the West Midlands primary school are running around, skipping, playing soccer - and exchanging music files on their personal digital assistants (PDAs). </p> <p>In one corner, a couple are using Bluetooth technology to play noughts and crosses. In another, a girl is showing a boy how to change colours on the tiny screen. </p> <p>The school has bought 50 Palm PDAs since February, and the Wren's Nest is in the first wave of an ambitious new project. \"We want to have handhelds for all the children in one of Dudley's townships by next year,\" says John Davies from the authority's National Grid for Learning (NGfL) team. </p> <p>\"Then rolling out to all the schoolchildren in the borough.\" Every student and teacher in Dudley? That's 40,000 handhelds. </p> <p>All the kit is coming from Palm. The Wren's Nest children were equipped with the Tungsten T2, while the T3s are going to the other first-phase children. </p> <p>Palm's latest device, the Zire 72, was designed with Dudley's education blueprint in mind. It features a built-in digital camera, audio/video capture and playback, and Bluetooth technology. </p> <p>In phase three, Dudley's kids will be provided with a \"learner's kitbag\", which will contain the handheld, a Bluetooth modem, stereo headphones and a protective case. </p> <p>Headteacher at the Wren's Nest, Ruth Wylie, took a careful look at the implications before agreeing to join phase one of the project. The school serves a disadvantaged estate and props up Dudley's league tables. In the past, results have been dire. </p> <p>\"We are working really hard to improve standards, and I didn't want anything to distract us from that,\" she says. </p> <p>There was also the worry about security. Children would be allowed to take the handhelds home. What about damage, theft, the risk of bullying or even mugging? \"We've had no problems,\" says Wylie. \"Quite the contrary, the kids have really looked after their Palms. We've had accidents, but the Palms bounce pretty well. We had one in a puddle which is drying out at the moment.\" </p> <p>This mirrors the experience of schools involved in similar loan schemes involving laptop computers. Damage and loss has been negligible. The disadvantage of laptop schemes hasn't been the security issue, but the weight of the kit plus the replacement cost of the machine at the end of its lifespan. A PDA bypasses both of those problems. </p> <p>Year 5 children at the Wren's Nest were delighted when they received their handhelds early this year. \"[You should have seen their] their faces when they found out,\" says Wylie. \"We had 100% attendance on the day they were handed out and attendance has since improved in year 5. There has been a huge impact.\" </p> <p>Children were allowed to take the devices home to charge them up, with the intention that a training session would be held in school the following day. \"But it wasn't a matter of us telling them how to use the machines - they were telling us,\" says Wylie. \"They'd discovered the voice recorder, they knew the time in New York, they worked out how to change the background colour of the screen.\" </p> <p>One real learning plus has been the handwriting recognition - which uses a program called Giraffe. \"It requires you to start your letters at the right place and form them properly,\" Wylie explains. \"We had a handwriting scheme in school, but the Palm has been much more effective.\" </p> <p>Children at the school are enthusiastic about the Palm Pilots. \"We can write stories, and beam messages to each other,\" says Brandon Freeman. The Palm-to-Palm communication, using infrared or Bluetooth, is probably the most popular capability, but pupil Reanne Beach points out that the device has a maths programme that can be used as an aide to learning tables. \"My mum can test me at home,\" she says. \"And you can use the notepad if you have to jot down your homework.\" </p> <p>Teachers at the school are looking forward to a time when children use the handhelds as a matter of routine. \"One of the things I would like to explore is the e-book,\" says Wylie. \"Boys seem more willing to read from the Palm screen.\" She is also excited about the possibilities for children to act as researchers, making a record of their findings as they go along, with pictures and voice notes. </p> <p>\"We make wonderful models in design and technology,\" she says. \"But when the project is over, they have to be dismantled. With these, the children could make a record of what they had done.\" </p> <p>The Wren's Nest is not the first school to use PDAs in class. A Monmouthshire primary has been using handhelds for some time. In fact, the logic for primary heads is inescapable. A PDA costs around \u00a3200, so for the cost of a half a dozen PCs, you can kit out a whole class. </p> <p>But Dudley's ambitions go beyond the classroom. The authority plans to offer the kit to every learner in the borough, child or adult. Funding will come from a mix of sources, with parents expected to pay a contribution. </p> <p>\"For Wren's Nest parents, that might mean the equivalent of a packet of crisps a week,\" says Davies. He's trying to avoid the scenario where parents who can afford the kit enable their children to leapfrog ahead of the rest. </p> <p>\"We want a scheme that delivers a device to everyone,\" he says.</p> <p>PalmOne: <a href=\"http://www.palmOne.com\">www.palmOne.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Where would you go to find cutting-edge education ICT - games, graphics and even holographic virtual reality images that can literally walk off the screen? Hollywood? Pinewood? How about Gateshead? Or, to be more specific, the Gateshead City Learning Centre (CLC). </p> <p>Next to a school and with views across the Tyne and the former Swan Hunter shipyard, this city technology college pilots cutting-edge educational ICT. Working in partnership with local schools, new media companies and the nearby Teesside University virtual reality centre, Gateshead CLC is a modern, purpose-built, high-tech, high-spec incubator with the kind of resources schools can only dream about. </p> <p>It has computer animation suites, graphic modelling and multimedia recording studios. It is funded by a generous single regeneration budget grant and the result is a burgeoning new media industry. Here are some highlights from current trials. </p> <p><strong> A walk through history </strong> </p> <p>A cleverly constructed educational programme using 3D animation and games technology is bringing history to life for year 8 pupils from St Thomas More school in Gateshead. The pilot software takes them on a mission through a virtual 18th-century French town to discover key facts about a moment in history. Ben Ostell from the bottom set is delighted to have found inspiration at last. </p> <p>Working on his own, he breaks off to explain how: \"Last week we were learning all about the storming of the Bastille. This is better than a book, because in a book you can't really tell what's going on - you have to imagine it. Here you can see what's going on and what people really looked like.\" </p> <p>Using the directional arrows on his keypad to control a car toon character - a 21st-century teenager - Ben and his classmates move around the town questioning the people they meet about the causes and effects of the French revolution. There is a priest, a nobleman, peasants and revolutionaries. </p> <p>Besides a spoken answer, clicking on an animation could throw up a hotlink to a piece of original text or source material about the French revolution. Pupils use the information they discover to inspire their writing, answer quizzes or complete multiple-choice exercises. Ben's class are all keen on the pilot material they have been using for two hours a week for the past six weeks. Their comments have been fed back to the software's designer, Chris Brannigan, chief executive of Caspian Learning. </p> <p>The big motivator for the pupils is the competitive nature of the game. Not only can they move around the virtual world, learning at their own pace, but they can get instant feedback from quizzes and the chance to go back and improve on their results. The program even prompts pupils by pinpointing the areas they need to brush up on. </p> <p>Pupil Rebecca Macaleese sees the educational program as an interactive, animated book. \"No, it's not really a game. You put questions to the characters you meet from a menu of choices. They're good questions; they make sense to me. They are the sort of things I would have asked. It makes learning more fun.\" </p> <p>Jessica Smith and Ruth Gordon are doing the exercises together. \"It motivates you because you learn in a different way,\" says Ruth. \"The scores I get now are much higher than when I first started.\" </p> <p>History teacher Craig Jones is delighted at the progress his bottom set has made and he is impressed by the similar uplift experienced by high achievers in the top set. \"The software is all about differentiation by outcomes,\" he says. \"As pupils progress, the tasks get harder. The top set moves further and learns more.\" </p> <p>Most importantly, the low achievers are hooked and motivated by their success. As they improve and are given time, some might even catch up with the top set. The game has fitted in well with the year 8 curriculum. </p> <p>\"We teach the Tudors and the English civil war, and there are sites and historic buildings we can take children to,\" says Jones. </p> <p>\"But the French revolution is much more distant and the only resources we have are textbooks and a video of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities.\" Brannigan plans to develop games-based educational software to cover major topics across the entire curriculum. New titles in development include volcanoes, government and democracy, world religions, maths and literacy across the ability range. </p> <p>He is refining his French revolution program with the St Thomas More pupils before launching the product, so what we are seeing here is a first glimpse of things to come. The hardest part was the two years' development he undertook with a group of fellow PhD students at St Andrews University to design a games engine adapted to a wide variety of learning styles and subject content. Incredibly, his inspiration came from a failed e-learning initiative by the US military. </p> <p>\"The American army had spent $5m trying to develop games-based e-learning that could be used with a Sony Playstation,\" he says. \"But they started from the wrong angle - technology. We approached the project from the user's perspective, asking how people process learning.\"</p> <p> The French revolution game gives users ample opportunity to consolidate their knowledge. As soon as information is introduced it is followed up with simple memory tasks such as quizzes. Further into the \"game\", pupils progress to more sophisticated information handling. Building knowledge incrementally boosts pupils' test results and written work as well as their confidence. Children learn best when engaged fully with the subject matter. In the case of the French revolution game, history is presented in the form of a vivid, first-hand account. Gateshead has been very quick to spot the educational potential of the educational games technology being piloted and Caspian Learning has sold a licence to Gateshead LEA for all its schools. \"We're going to roll out 10 modules in 90 schools - half at key stage 2 and half at key stages 3 and 4,\" says Brannigan. </p> <p><strong> 3D space journey</strong> </p> <p>In true horror movie tradition the A-level biology class from St Thomas More's school don bipolar glasses to view some amazing computer-generated 3D images. We are watching the structure of a molecule and the unravelling twin strands of DNA. Pupils are reaching out of their desks convinced the illusion projected from a wall-sized electronic whiteboard can actually be touched. Later they will take a look at blood pumping around the heart. The visuals are being trialled in conjunction with Teesside University's virtual reality centre, a testbed for new technology and new media start-up companies. </p> <p>\"Teachers in the north-east are getting to grips with the potential of high quality 3D,\" says Andy McPherson, manager of Gateshead CLC. </p> <p>\"Visuals like these are a key part of the computer-aided design (Cad) is used by companies such as Jaguar cars to create visual prototypes and by animation companies such as Perfect Storm that produce special effects for the Harry Potter films.\" </p> <p>Unlike holograms (fixed images reproduced by laser light), these virtual reality (VR) images can only be viewed through bipolar glasses. The 3D effect comes from a stereoscopic camera.</p> <p> When looked at through the special glasses the image that has been modelled or photographed appears to have a solid shape but is in fact an optical illusion. The technology is related to that used to create a recent ground-breaking VR image of an Egyptian mummy, produced from enhanced sectional photographs generated by a magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scanner. </p> <p>Nigel Rodwell, technical director of the VR centre, says the technology is useful for showing close-up images of objects too precious to handle or to model the inner workings of the body, for example. It can even be used to take children on journeys into the past where they can walk through computer-generated images of, for example, ancient Rome. Cost is the big issue, says Rodwell. \"Our biggest customers are museums that want us to create 3D images of exhibits that are too valuable to let people touch.\" </p> <p><strong> Kahootz</strong> </p> <p>A year 6 class from Corpus Christi Roman Catholic primary in Bensham, Tynemouth, visits the Gateshead city learning centre one morning a week to prepare for a web link with two schools down under - Marina View primary in Auckland, New Zealand, and Mount Waverley North primary school in Melbourne, Australia. </p> <p>They use Kahootz software to create 3D images of local scenes to post on a password-protected page on the Kahootz website, which will be accessed by the three schools. Exchanging such information-rich files would not normally be possible, given the constraints on schools' bandwidth, but Kahootz uses Xpressions, a program to compress files. </p> <p>Published by the Australian Children's Television Foundation, Kahootz is a set of interactive 3D multimedia tools. It allows users to make their own virtual worlds, combining words and graphics to produce \"living books\". The Gateshead centre is piloting this link with a eight schools in the north-east. </p> <p>Working at PCs in one of the computer suites, this is year 6's third visit to the centre. Their teacher has divided them into groups of three and four to create visualisations of six local landmarks - Tynemouth, Newcastle airport, the city centre, the funfair, St James' Park and the landmark iron statue, the Angel of the North. Under the eye of the school's ICT coordinator, Joanne Phillips, pupils are selecting and downloading Google image files to drag and drop into their computer-generated environment. </p> <p>They also have a menu of options to add figures, animals or cars to the scene, and a set of controls allows them to enlarge, minimise or animate these images. They even have a soundtrack option to add noises when someone clicks on a image. </p> <p>\"This is a low-threshold, high-ceiling activity,\" says Phillips. \"Pupils can get a lot out of it and the more able can learn to animate. Dyslexic children like the visual nature of the tasks; it raises their self-esteem.\" </p> <p>The possibilities of the software can extend the brightest pupils but the automation also allows less motivated pupils to achieve seemingly impressive results with minimal effort. Yianna is clicking on a set of directional arrows to move a computer-generated cartoon figure around a 3D street scene. </p> <p>Kahootz has been used to great effect in reception year classes - getting a figure to move is an absorbing task for younger children who are learning coordination. For use with older children in year 6, say, teacher intervention is needed to avoid pupils clicking aimlessly. </p> <p>One group of high-ability pupils has built a working 3D model of an airport, and Kiah and Jack are examining their world by turning the vision through 360 degrees. </p> <p>\"We've got planes landing and taking off,\" says Kiah. \"We're trying to show what an airport is really like.\" </p> <p>Their teacher comments: \"This group is setting a challenge for the Australian pupils by hiding objects or clues in the virtual world for them to find.\" </p> <p>Overall, Phillips is pleased with the results. \"This hits 60% of our ICT key stage 2 targets. We're finding out information and processing that information. The pupils print out their work and we pin it up for everyone to see and comment on it.\" </p> <p>Peter Stevenson, Gateshead CLC's training and development manager, points out that this is just a beginning. \"We see Kahootz as a link into more complicated exercises such as video editing. To introduce primary schools to the idea of 3D worlds is perfect for that.\" </p> <p>Kahootz publisher Peter Maggs adds: \"All kids need is five or 10 minutes of preparation, experimenting and using their innate creativity. If anything, the challenge is to get the teachers up to the same level.\"</p>",
  "<p>Stir a little imagination in with ICT and you can do without expensive, state-of-the-art technology. For some children, their schooldays can be transformed by the relative simplicity of a fart machine, a talking photo album or the visualisation on Windows Media Player software. </p> <p>We are at Woodlawn school, North Tyneside, which caters for just over 80 pupils with a range of physical, medical or sensory difficulties. When you can't speak, communication technology has the power to transform your life.</p> <p> A group of teenagers is sitting around telling jokes, making excuses, sharing snippets of holiday information and gossiping about the weekend. Nothing unusual in that, apart from the fact that they weren't using their voices but hands, heads and feet - whatever worked best. </p> <p>For Sarah, it was definitely her feet. She's so confident about her toe control and speed at using her Voca (voice output communication aid), that she recently challenged Newcastle United's Peter Beardsley to see if his footwork was faster than hers. He had no chance. </p> <p>Val Brown, the school's deputy head and ICT coordinator is also a great fan of cheaper, less sophisticated communication tools from places like the Gadget Shop. </p> <p>\"One real success has been the talking photo album. This wallet of plastic pockets has pages with space for a recordable message. Coupled with a digital camera, it's a powerful way of linking home and school for children who would not be able to tell others about their day. Parents and teachers take pictures and record messages to create a diary that can be shared,\" he says. </p> <p>The fart machine is another favourite. \"When a child can't take their Voca into the playground, they might take the fart machine instead. It's a way of making your presence felt and getting a laugh from others - not always easy when you have no speech and are strapped in a wheelchair.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year, Woodlawn was one of the winners of this year's Learning Environment awards for schools, sponsored by the computer systems supplier Ramesys. </p> <p>The overall winner was Holy Cross boys' school in Belfast, a name that may sound familiar because its sister school, Holy Cross Girls, was in the news when Catholic pupils had to be given a riot police escort to school along a contested stretch of road.</p> <p> According to visiting awards judge Steve Smith, from Ramesys, it was \"an island of calm but exciting learning in truly difficult circumstances\". </p> <p>However, the head made it clear he wasn't seeking conces sions or offering excuses - just looking for excellence. \"I dropped in on eight different classrooms, each filled with children excited and engaged by what they were doing,\" says Smith. </p> <p>\"ICT use was a normal part of every lesson. There was videoconferencing, voting with handsets linked to whiteboards, video-editing, creating animations and all the more usual things like using the web and different applications. </p> <p>\"At Holy Cross, engagement reaches beyond the pupils to parents, many of whom come in to learn alongside their children and end up gaining ICT and other qualifications which subsequently help them find work. </p> <p>\"What struck me, not just in this school but in several, was how essential leadership support is. In many cases it's one gifted teacher who starts off this inspirational use of ICT. If they don't get management support, it stays as something one class or one subject group benefit from. </p> <p>\"At Holy Cross, the head, Terry Laverty, backed the use of ICT completely. Teachers willing to experiment need more support than those who do things as they always have. It takes faith and tenacity to try something new and different so you need the management to back you.\"</p> <p> One of the school's gifted experimenters is Colin Richardson. The children in his class were bubbling over as they described what they had been doing. </p> <p>\"Some people think it's play,\" one pupil explains, \"but it's not, we're learning in a different way.\" For Richardson, interactive whiteboards are a classroom essential. </p> <p>\"I asked for one when I came to the school, now every class has one and embedding use of ICT is in the school development plan. If I went for another job, the first thing I'd check is that I'd have a board,\" he says. </p> <p>He was the deserving winner of the Transforming Teaching and Learning section, making extraordinary use of the ordinary. Video clips from Jamie Oliver and Delia Smith's cookery programmes were used to teach imperative verbs then pupils emailed and phoned children in partner schools with recipe instructions, which fitted in with the history lessons on Victorians and Peppermint Creams. </p> <p>It was possible to tell how well all that had worked because Richardson videoed the children doing it. Art and music were given a fresh approach through using the visualisations on Media Player with pupils, then creating their own artwork in response to different music. Richardson even made use of the talents of an artistic friend, persuading her to scan in some of the world's best paintings to create a virtual gallery using PowerPoint and then videoing her explanations of what they were all about. </p> <p> And what better way to demonstrate the importance of creating a storyboard than using the director's cut section from the popular Monsters Inc DVD, where they discuss just that? Further information on the awards can be found online at: <a href=\"http://www.ramesys.com/LearningEnvironmentAwards\">www.ramesys.com/LearningEnvironmentAwards</a>. </p> <p>Next year, Ramesys will be the lead sponsor of Becta's ICT in Practice Awards, which will include the collaboration category from the Learning Environment Awards as a new section for the first time. </p>",
  "<p>Last year, at Special Needs London 2003, you couldn't get a copy of the show guide in large print. I know. I tried. Let's hope the organisers are better prepared for this year's event, which is at Olympia from September 30 to October 2. This is the last show before part three of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) comes into force on October 1. The crux of the act is that you must \"make adjustments\" if it is impossible, or unreasonably difficult, for a disabled person to access your products or services. </p> <p>Many staff are still trying to comply with part four of the act, which requires schools and local education authorities \"not to treat disabled pupils less favourably for a reason related to disability\". This has caused a flurry of accessibility strategies, to increase disabled children's participation in the school curriculum. Not content with that, Removing Barriers to Achievement - the government's current strategy for SEN - demands that teachers and planners embed inclusive practice in every school, to meet the needs of the one in six pupils who, while they may not be disabled, are considered to have \"special needs\". </p> <p>Special Needs London is a good place to find equipment and software to meet these differing agendas. If physical accessibility is high on your list, check out the Nortek (stand SN260). Nortek makes accessible school furniture. Look out for its variable-height tables, including IT workstations, sinks and cooker worktables for wheelchair users. </p> <p>Assessment and individual education plans (IEPs) are crucial. Learn How publications (SN319) has IEP Writer 3, with primary and secondary target banks linked to the national curriculum. Epar (SN430) has several new products including IEP Wizard, an attendance recording system to track absence patterns, and Sanctions Wizard, which takes care of the administration and recording of detentions. </p> <p>Several companies are looking at early skills-building activities. Crick Software's new product, JigWorks (SN638), helps teachers to create puzzles, labels and sorting activities. It is aimed at foundation and key stage 1, but because teachers can use any picture they want, it is also being used to make age-appropriate materials for older learners. </p> <p>Sherston (SN30) has a new SEN specialist. Sarah Helton, a former Senco and teacher of autistic children, is responsible for Interactive Photo Cards, a series of programs on CD-rom to develop concepts and vocabulary. The settings can be changed to meet the needs of individual pupils, so speech and text can be switched on and off, and the software is fully switch accessible. There are four levels of difficulty and Sherston has tried to address the motivational needs of pupils too. \"Low self-esteem can often hinder class performance,\" said Helton. \"For this reason we've incorporated animated sequences to reward and encourage pupils.\" </p> <p>On the literacy front, Semerc (SN720) is following up on the success of its very solid Spell Track with a collection of CD-roms and workbooks covering memory, the alphabet, visual perception, and reading and writing skills. </p> <p>Look out for resources from Iansyst (SN335), which specialises in soft- and hardware for people with dyslexia. Find out about speech recognition, text-to-speech software and mind-mapping. It also has comprehensive collections of literacy and numeracy software, including the increasingly popular Start to Finish series from Don Johnston. </p> <p>Widgit will be showing the results of the Symbols Inclusion Project, aimed at mainstream primary schools. A teacher and a teaching assistant were seconded from Warwickshire LEA. They have created resources for literacy, numeracy, science and humanities using Writing With Symbols and Communicate: In Print. See the fruits of the project at SN223. </p> <p>Finally, visit the Royal National Institute for the Blind's stand (SN617) for resources for blind and partially sighted children. There are two million people with sight problems in the UK and some of them may want to access the services that you provide. </p> <h2>Weblinks</h2> <p>Crick Software: <a href=\"http://www.learninggrids.com\">learninggrids.com</a></p> <p>Don Johnston: <a href=\"http://www.donjohnston.co.uk\">donjohnston.co.uk </a></p> <p>Epar: <a href=\"http://www.epar-software.com\">epar-software.com</a></p> <p>Dyslexic.com: <a href=\"http://www.dyslexic.com\">dyslexic.com</a> </p> <p>Learn How: <a href=\"http://www.learnhowpublications.co.uk\">learnhowpublications.co.uk</a> </p> <p>Semerc: <a href=\"http://www.granada-learning.com\">granada-learning.com</a> </p> <p>Sherston: <a href=\"http://www.sherston.com\">sherston.com</a></p> <p>Widgit: <a href=\"http://www.widgit.com/SIP\">widgit.com/SIP</a></p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England has lifted its base rate by 1.25 percentage points from a low of 3.5 per cent last November to 4.75 per cent today. But some banks and building societies have behaved shabbily and only passed on some of this rise to their loyal customers.</p> <p>Savers had a rough ride during the period of very low interest rates last year. Most banks and building societies passed on each successive 0.25 percentage point base rate cut to savers in full, as rates fell from 6 per cent in 2000 to 3.5 per cent. So have they now passed on rising rates in full? Not a bit of it. In some cases they have passed on just three-quarters or less of the cumulative rise in base rate since last November. Take a look at our <a href=\"http://money.theguardian.com/graphic/0,10290,1313902,00.html\"> table</a> to see just how little of the base rate rise the savings providers passed on.</p> <p>At the same time they are wooing new savers with top-paying new accounts while leaving old-style accounts to wither on the vine. This proves that if you want to earn a decent rate on your money, you must keep a close eye on your account. Money Observer's best buys each month may not be the very top rates, but they offer a consistently good deal. We ignore the window dressing of short-term bonuses that temporarily boost the headline rate in favour of those that have paid a consistently good rate or come with a guarantee to move in line with base rate.</p> <p>Much has changed over the 25 years Money Observer has covered savings accounts. Until the mid-1980s building societies ran a cartel and paid similar rates on a limited range of branch-based accounts. But increased competition and new legislation changed the face of the industry. Some of the giant building societies, including Halifax and Abbey, converted to banks while the number and types of accounts mushroomed.</p> <p>Easy access accounts paying top rates were launched, often carrying the name Gold, but some of these have become tarnished over the years. Then came postal accounts, telephone accounts and finally internet accounts. At the same time clearing banks joined in, as did supermarkets and new-style banks offering just telephone and internet accounts. The end result is thousands of accounts, some good value and some appalling. </p> <p>Research by Money Observer shows that some of the largest savings institutions have passed on a paltry 0.8 of a percentage point since last November, against a 1.25 point rise in base rate. Under the Banking Code (the industry's rules on how it should treat its customers) banks and building societies must contact you if you have \u00a3250 or more in an account and the rate has 'fallen significantly' compared with the Bank of England base rate (that is, a reduction of 0.5 percentage points or more relative to base rate in a rolling 12-month period).</p> <p>Any pre-tax rise of less than 0.75 per cent since November last year, based on a 1.25 point rise in base rate, means your bank or building society must give you at least 60 days to switch to another account or withdraw your money with no notice period or charges. take notice of notices</p> <p>If you have a branch-based account, a bank or building society does not have to tell you personally about any changes. It can simply put up notices in branches and advertise the changes in a newspaper. On telephone, internet and postal accounts it has to tell you personally within 30 days of changes. It also has to send you a summary of rates at least once a year, unless you have less than \u00a3500 in the account.</p> <p>The worst offenders over the past year include Bradford &amp; Bingley First Choice and Britannia's Capital Trust 30 and Premier Saver. We list in the table just how much of the 1.25 point rise leading savings institutions have passed on - and the lousy rates they pay loyal savers, most of whom are not even earning sufficient after tax to match inflation of 3 per cent.</p> <p>Others that have short-changed savers include Halifax 60 Day Gold, Bonus Gold, Liquid Gold and Saver Reward, Abbey Investor 30 and Nationwide CapitalBuilder. Some savers in newer-style accounts, such as cash mini Isas, have also fallen by the way. For example, Alliance &amp; Leicester has passed on just 0.8 points to some of its cash mini Isa savers over the past 12 months. Rates now start at 4.15 per cent on balances up to \u00a39,000. These savers are getting just 0.05 of a percentage point extra following the 0.25 point rise in base rate on 5 August. A&amp;L's new rates do not take effect until 1 October, a month after most of its competitors.</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> Money Observer is celebrating its 25th anniversary with the publication of its October issue, on sale Thursday 23rd September.

  "The South African singer and former beauty queen Dolly Rathebe, who has died aged 76 following a stroke, became Africa's first acknowledged international female actor when she starred in the 1949 British-produced movie, Jim Comes To Jo'burg - the first film to portray urban Africans in a positive light. <p>The producers were looking for a light-skinned woman to play the female lead until Rathebe mesmerised them with her rendition of Salt Lake City Blues. Even though it was not a great financial success, Jim Comes To Jo'burg projected Rathebe into the limelight, and she became known as the South African Billie Holiday and the African Marilyn Monroe. </p> <p>Drum magazine picked her to feature on its front cover in 1957. But when the German photographer Jurgen Schadeberg took Rathebe to a mine dump for the shoot, they were arrested for contravening the Immorality Act, which forbade interracial relationships. Rathebe later became a lead singer with two popular township bands, the Harlem Swingsters and the Inkspots. Such was her beauty that it was said that when men greeted one another, and wanted to stress that all was well, they would say, \"It is Dolly.\" </p> <p>Rathebe was born Jose-phine Kedibone in Randfontein, near Johannesburg. Her father was a migrant labourer and her mother came from a farming family. She attended St Cyrian missionary school in Sophiatown, the only area of Johannesburg where blacks could own freehold property - and a place where whites could go, even though it was against the law, to drink, listen to music and discuss issues with blacks and Indians. This experience had a lasting impression on Rathebe, who never found it difficult to mingle with people across racial divides. </p> <p>Her father, whom she described as the best man she ever met, was often away working in the gold mines, and this led to the breakdown of her parents' marriage. At 15, she became the family breadwinner. She then began a singing career - which led to her auditioning for Jim Comes To Jo'burg. </p> <p>Rathebe, by now the first African female star, fell in love with William Buti Nketle, a notorious Sophiatown gangleader. She soon became a gangster's moll, often at the forefront of battles against rival gangs. </p> <p>With leading roles in Alf Herbert's African Jazz and Variety Show and in Gibson Kente's Sikalo, Rathebe's career continued to blossom, and she became a mentor to up-and-coming artists such as Miriam Makeba, Thandi Klaasen, Dorothy Masuka and Sophie Mgcina. But while other musicians left for exile, Rathebe stayed behind and endured apartheid. </p> <p>Her beloved Sophiatown was finally destroyed in the early 1960s. Rathebe, now the lead singer in the Afro-Jazz group the Elite Swingsters, found it increasingly difficult to perform, especially after an 8pm curfew was imposed. She later moved her family to Cape Town, where she ran a shebeen for many years. </p> <p>The birth of democracy in South Africa brought Rathebe back to the spotlight. She rejoined the Elite Swingsters and performed at the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as South Africa's first black president. In 1994, she sang at Westminster Abbey in a ceremony to mark South Africa's return to the Commonwealth. </p> <p>She performed in television shows and films, both in and outside South Africa. She also had a role alongside the American actor James Earl Jones in the film Cry, The Beloved Country. </p> <p>Last year, she was honoured with a series of concerts organised by Miriam Makeba. She used some of the proceeds to build a community hall for the elderly, and was involved in other humanitarian projects. Before her death, she was nominated for the Order of Ikhamanga, awarded to South Africans who have excelled in their fields. </p> <p>She was married twice, and is survived by two daughters and a son. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Josephine 'Dolly' Rathebe, singer, born April 2 1928; died September 16 2004</p>"
