  "<p>The England cricketers are not renowned for Wisden swotting but, when they regroup at The Oval today, they will be aware that they are on the verge of something momentous. </p> <p>Victory over West Indies in the final Test, which starts tomorrow, would be their seventh in as many matches, equalling the two longest winning sequences in their history: the England of the 1880s, of Grace, Shrewsbury, Lohmann and Stoddart, and of the late 1920s, the side of Hobbs, Hammond, Larwood and Tate. </p> <p>Comparisons with those sides seems futile. But looking at a more recent England, one that required Andy Caddick and Darren Gough to get the wickets and Alec Stewart, Mike Atherton and Graham Thorpe to score the runs, it can be seen that responsibility is more evenly distributed within the current team. And that is much more important than England achieving a magnificent seven in London SE11 over the next few days. </p> <p>When Steve Harmison struggled against West Indies on slow pitches at Lord's and Edgbaston, Ashley Giles came to the fore. When the top-order batsmen have faltered, they have been bailed out by Andrew Flintoff and Geraint Jones. </p> <p>At Old Trafford on Monday, when Marcus Trescothick and Michael Vaughan failed and Graham Thorpe was injured, it was the tyro Robert Key who took the weight on his shoulders. </p> <p>A happy and successful team, one no longer led by the unimaginative Stewart or Atherton, has generated confidence and bred egalitarianism. Instead of leading and bit-part players the cast is long, with everyone capable of a star turn; it feels a little like watching Death on the Nile or The Longest Day. </p> <p>Vaughan is still learning his job. But some unorthodox field settings reveal a captain who is willing to experiment. He cannot take all the credit for what has happened. Consistency of selection has encouraged confidence that turned to complacency only in the opening days of the Manchester Test. </p> <p>Whether this team matches up to the last Ashes-winning England team, Mike Gatting's 1986-87 side, is another matter. If Vaughan looked at that line-up he might place covetous eyes on the names of Phil Edmonds and John Emburey, a pair of quality spinners who gave Gatting control when he could not have wickets. </p> <p>The middle order of Gatting, David Gower, Allan Lamb and Ian Botham was eye-catching too. And Graham Dilley, for a short period at least, was a world-class opening bowler, offering pace, bounce and away swing, though Vaughan would never trade Harmison for him. </p> <p>Harmison may have taken the headlines in the winter, just as Flintoff has this summer, but that has disguised the fact that this has been very much a team performance. </p> <p>That is something Vaughan and the coach Duncan Fletcher will be keenly aware of when they introduce fresh talent, as is likely to happen in the case of Ian Bell tomorrow. It is up to Bell to fit in as easily as the clearly popular Key. </p> <p>Even if West Indies had the players - and they had the better of the Old Trafford Test in the opening innings - their awful body language betrayed a team in disarray. And they will not improve that until they appoint a new captain capable of working harmoniously with his coach. </p> <p>The best England side ever? That is the stuff of protracted argument but many believe it to be the side that toured Australia in 1958-59. </p> <p>The tour party that winter included Peter May, Colin Cowdrey, Tom Graveney, Ted Dexter, Fred Trueman, Brian Statham, Frank Tyson, Jim Laker and Tony Lock, Trevor Bailey and Godfrey Evans. </p> <p>They lost that Ashes series 4-1. And in Sydney, where they drew, they ended considerably more drawn than their opponents.</p>",
  "<p>Kostas Kederis and Ekaterini Thanou, the Greek sprinters who, it is alleged, deliberately evaded four drugs tests, left hospital yesterday with Kederis having been treated for scratches and Thanou with no visible injuries. </p> <p>The two athletes had been hospitalised since claiming to be involved in a mysterious motorcycle crash shortly after missing dope tests last Thursday. They left in separate cars about 45 minutes apart. </p> <p>A report by Athens' leading medical examiner said Kederis, the 200m gold medallist at the Sydney Olympics, had some scratches on a shin and the right elbow. However, a source said each athlete had complained of dizziness and the examiner's inspection on Monday could not rule out internal head injuries. </p> <p>The initial hospital report had said Thanou had suffered abdominal injuries and a sprain to the right leg, whereas Kederis had slight head injuries, a sprain to the vertebra at the back of his neck, a knee sprain and scratches to the right leg. </p> <p>Yesterday a Greek government source said: \"Filipos Koutsaftis has completed his medical examination of the athletes as ordered by the state prosecutor Dimitris Papangelopoulos. He did not find any injuries to Thanou and only minor injuries to Kederis.\" </p> <p>Papangelopoulos had sent Koutsaftis to check on the athletes after sections of the media questioned the accident and its causes. </p> <p>\"It's a big injustice, I have never used banned substances - honestly,\" said Kederis as he left hospital before preparing to face today's disciplinary hearing. \"All these people who crucify me on TV are the same people who wanted to be photographed with me after every success. But after crucifixion comes resurrection.\" </p> <p>Kederis and Thanou, the Olympic 100m silver medallist, had appealed to the International Olympic Committee to be allowed to give drug tests while in the hospital, but officials refused. </p> <p>\"They hoped to be tested for doping at the hospital, [believing] that this would be in their favour,\" said Arne Ljungqvist of the IOC medical commission. \"I don't know what their strategy was, but we did not fall for it. It would not make any sense to test them in the hospital. You can fix things there so you don't get a positive result.\" </p> <p>Kederis and Thanou must explain to a three-man disciplinary panel today why they were unavailable for testing on at least four occasions in 18 days. </p> <p>Meanwhile the US sprinter Torri Edwards last night lost an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over the two-year ban she received last month for taking a stimulant.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The big event</strong><br> </p> <p> The athletics programme gets under way and the first event, the shot (06.30), is being staged amid the ruined columns of ancient Olympia, site of the original games.

Two Russians, <strong> Irina Korzhanenko</strong> and <strong> Svetlana Krivelyova,</strong> head the women's list followed by two Belarussians.

  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> On a day of shifty breezes on the Saronic Gulf, Britain's strongest sailing competitors worked their way through adversity. Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield snapped back from an 18th place in the fifth race of the men's 470s with a fifth in the next and still lead the class overall. In the women's 470, Christina Bassadone and Katherine Hopson did well with a fifth and a sixth to move up to fifth overall after six races with five to come. In the 49er class Chris Draper and Simon Hiscocks finished ninth. In the Laser class neither Ben Ainslie nor Shirley Robertson were in action. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In the men's hockey Great Britain slipped to a 3-2 defeat after equalising twice against the Sydney silver medallists South Korea in their second match of the competition.

  "<p>And the winner of the gold medal for national self-flagellation over the early failure of its athletes to live up pre-Olympic expectations is . . . the United States. </p> <p>In Britain, we may not yet be ready to declare a state of mourning over Team GB's measly medal total of one silver and one bronze, but then we never proclaimed ourselves to be the greatest sporting nation on the planet; we didn't send the largest team to Athens, other than that of the host nation; and we didn't arrive in town with the most hyped (or should that be over-hyped?) water vessel since the Titanic headed out to sea. </p> <p>At least Michael Phelps has managed three gold medals, although he shines out like a beacon. Yesterday his team-mate Jason Lezak, the fastest 100m freestyle swimmer in the world this year, finished 21st in the heats for the event. </p> <p>The Americans believed they were in line to win 30 to 35 medals in the pool, including 15 golds. Thus far they have won 18, with six golds - not terrible, but enough to make a mockery of their predictions. </p> <p>However, it would be wrong to single out the American swimmers. The US basketball team, packed with NBA stars, was at the embarrassing end of a 92-73 defeat by Puerto Rico. The US shooting team - packed with army-trained marksmen - was expected to win half a dozen medals. So far it has won none. </p> <p>Needless to say, the inquest has already begun. The New York Times' thesis was that US athletes have been cowed by their Olympic Committee's instruction to tone down their patriotism. \"This good taste effort is admirable and smart in the current climate but [it] is dulling the edge on the American team,\" its columnist Selena Roberts wrote. </p> <p>Jim Scherr, the chief executive of the USOC, suggested that his team needed the momentum that comes with a few big victories. \"We hope to get on a roll, but what happened with the basketball team has probably had a negative impact.\" </p> <p>He could be right. Then again, he could be making the same mistake as his supremely cocky basketball players in refusing to countenance the idea that the rest of the sporting world might just be better.</p>",
  "<p>For a horse with a success rate of nearly 50%, Sulamani attracted a surprising number of unflattering nicknames from punters before the Juddmonte International Stakes at York yesterday. \"Sulkamani\" was at the more polite end of the spectrum, a reflection of the widespread belief that his commitment to the cause was less than absolute. </p> <p>But if ever there was a race that gave Sulamani the chance to wither under pressure it was the one that unfolded on the Knavesmire yesterday, and when he needed a final thrust to seize the victory, both the strength and the desire were there.</p> <p>Norse Dancer, another horse whose character has been called into question, had struck for home two furlongs out, and after a prolonged struggle it was only in the last 100 yards that Sulamani clawed his way to the front. Bago, the hot favourite and the first three-year-old home, was third.</p> <p>This was the fifth Group or Grade One win of Sulamani's career, which has included victories in the French Derby and, somewhat fortunately, the Arlington Million.</p> <p>Significantly, it was also a rare opportunity to race on the genuinely soft ground that suits him so well, conditions that may well prevail if Sulamani travels to Longchamp in October for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, a race in which he finished second two seasons ago.</p> <p>\"I think a lot of people questioned the fact that he was dropping back to a mile and a quarter, but really we weren't worried about that,\" Simon Crisford, Godolphin's racing manager, said.</p> <p>\"He's a very classy horse, he's got tremendous acceleration, and the three-furlong run-in was ideal for him. It was a top-class effort.</p> <p>\"He's always been a little bit sensitive and a bit slow in his development mentally. We have set him quite big tasks, but we always felt that as a five-year-old he could win a really big race.\"</p> <p>Sulamani is 6-1 (from 12-1) for the Arc with Coral, but his stable-mate, the King George winner Doyen, remains favourite at 6-4.</p> <p>\"Doyen is going to run in the Irish Champion Stakes [on September 11],\" Crisford said. \"After that we'll sit down and talk about it, but realistically it's probably unlikely that both would run in the Arc.\"</p> <p>Sulamani's victory sealed an other excellent afternoon for the Godolphin operation, following the front-running success of Rule Of Law in the Great Voltigeur Stakes.</p> <p>Given the Voltigeur's excellent record as a St Leger trial, it was no surprise to find him cut to 5-2 favourite (from 9-1) by Coral for the final Classic. However, a strong pace at Town Moor might ask serious questions of Rule Of Law's stamina, and Aidan O'Brien's Go For Gold, who ran on into third after travelling well a long way off the pace, might be one to note if he makes the trip to Doncaster. Godolphin's only reverse of the afternoon came in the Acomb Stakes, when their highly-rated juvenile Oude could finish only second to Mark Johnston's Elliots World. The winner is 25-1 for next year's 2,000 Guineas with Ladbrokes.</p> <p>Johnston said: \"We've got Leo's Lucky Star and Melrose Avenue, who are both entered this weekend, and Shamardal as well as this one, and they would be the clear pick of the ones that have run.\"</p>",
  "What is the rationalist to do? Atheists, feminists and anti-racists are paralysed by Islam. Whichever way they turn, they find themselves at risk of alliances with undesirables of every nasty hue. <p>Last month, the website of an organisation called the Islamic Human Rights Commission made me the \"winner\" of their \"Most Islamophobic media personality\" award. It has caused me a bombardment of emails of both extreme pro- and anti-Islamic poison, each one more luridly threatening than the last. The occasional note of reason from moderate Islamic groups is so weak it hardly makes itself heard. I had challenged the legitimacy of the idea of Islamophobia and warned of the danger to free speech of trying to make criticism of a religion a crime akin to racism. I pointed out yet again that theocracy is lethal. Wherever religion controls politics it drives out tolerance and basic human rights. The history of Christianity has been the perfect exemplar, a force for repression whenever it holds any political sway. It only turns peace-loving when it is powerless.</p> <p>People led by some unalterable revealed voice of God cannot be tolerant of the godless. At present it is Islamic states that head the danger list - though the dread power of southern Baptists in US politics endangers world peace, as do extreme Jewish sects holding power in Israel. Women are always the main victims, since extreme religions express their identities through male priestly supremacy and disgust of women.</p> <p>To give a flavour of the Islamic Human Rights Commission awards, Nick Griffin of the BNP won the most Islamophobic British politician award, Jacques Chirac and Ariel Sharon shared the international Islamophobic politician award and Islamophobe of the year was George Bush. That's the company I found myself in.</p> <p>When Griffin was interviewed on Newsnight after he was filmed saying disgusting things about Muslims, bizarrely accusing Islam of encouraging the rape of non-Muslim girls, he quoted my name in general support. So these days criticising any aspect of Islam risks landing you down among the worst racists.</p> <p>Other voices claim you for their cause. There is a particularly virulent swirl of extreme Hindu emails spreading fear and loathing of Muslims. But it's not all one-sided. A dangerous stream of Muslim anti-semitic venom also billows out on to the airways, inciting maximum hatred against Jews and sometimes Christians. </p> <p>The government wants to make incitement to religious hatred a crime, caving in to a vociferous Muslim campaign, although it is unlikely to make a spit of difference to these rabid religious enmities. (If the government really wants to foster religious harmony, it should abolish all religious schools, not build more.) To reassure outraged rationalists, ministers say that only a couple of people a year are expected to be prosecuted under it. So, why bother? That will inflame the religious even more as they refer case after case, expecting the law to protect their right not to be offended by mockery or criticism. They want religion placed in a realm beyond ordinary argument - and it is beginning to happen. </p> <p>Fear of offending the religious is gathering ground on all sides. It is getting harder to argue against the hijab and the Koran's edict that a woman's place is one step behind. It is beginning to be racist for teachers or social workers to object to autocratic patriarchy and submission of women within many Muslim communities. Islamic ideas that find the very notion of democracy incompatible with faith are beginning to be taken seriously by those who should defend liberal democracy. </p> <p>Of course most Muslims are not extremists. They speak of the peacefulness of their faith - as most religious people do. But they still too rarely speak out against terror when they should be combating their own extremists and being seen to do it. Moderate groups protest often against arrests of Muslim terror suspects, while the Muslim Council of Britain has sent out just one tepid call to mosques to cooperate with the police. Moderates excuse, rather than refute, the many ferocious verses calling for the blood of infidels in their holy book, verses that justify terror. Both the Koran and the Bible ought to be banned under the new law, since both are full of God's incitements to smite unbelievers. </p> <p>It is bizarre how the left has espoused the extreme Islamist cause: as \"my enemy's enemy\", Muslims are the best America-haters around. The hard left relishes terrorism: a fondness for explosions and the smell of martyrs' blood excites their revolutionary zeal, without sharing a jot of religious belief. </p> <p>More alarming is the softening of the brain of liberals and progressives. They increasingly find it easier to go with the flow that wants to mollify Muslim sentiment, for fear of joining the anti-immigration thugs who want to drive them from the land. </p> <p>The liberal dilemma over Islam is not unlike the prevarications of some over communism in the cold war. To attack the atrocities of the reds put you in bed with the anti-socialist Thatcher/Reagan red-baiters. What would George Orwell write about Islam now? He would probably ignore what others said about the company he kept, shrug off those claiming him for their own ends and plough his own furrow, speaking out against both the danger of religious fanaticism and the Muslim-hating racists - the polite ones in Times immigration panic articles or those with steel-toed boots on the streets of northern towns. </p> <p>There is a coherent non-Islamophobic position and Turkey holds the key. Here is a democratic Islamic society, where the radical secularising reforms of Kemal Ataturk make it a model for states needing to escape a theocratic past. It is progressing fast to meet human rights and economic criteria for joining the EU and should be welcomed with open arms, as a symbolic embrace for moderate secular Islam. Giscard d'Estaing's claim that the EU is \"Christendom\" was sheer racism, the same deranged clash-of-civilisations thinking that led to the disastrous Iraq war. </p> <p>Expecting a terrorist attack on Britain soon, this week the Muslim Council of Britain and chief police officers are preparing a booklet for Muslim households, warning them to prepare for a backlash. If these grim events happen, it will be more important than ever to keep a rational perspective on both the Muslim community and its back-lashers. Fellow-travelling with terrorism, either within the Muslim community, or by the left and woolly minded progressives, will not serve. </p> <p>It will be more important than ever to stand like Voltaire, ready to defend Muslims, their right to be here and to practise their beliefs against the growing swamped-by-aliens talk that Anas Altikriti warned against on these pages last week. But if he wants to stop the right \"smearing and demonising\" Islam, it would be wise to be more outspoken against its deformed branch that fosters terror. Muslims must also accept the right of others to criticise religions without smearing any critic as a racist.</p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "What is exceptional about the violence of the government-backed Janjaweed militia in Darfur, is less its scale than the intense - if belated - international attention it has received. <p>To oppose direct western intervention in Sudan is not to downplay Khartoum's crimes during this latest twist in the catastrophic war that has cost perhaps two million lives since 1983. Over the last 20 years, in order to shore up their exclusive and authoritarian rule, Sudan's succession of military rulers have done everything possible to sustain an often imaginary distinction between \"Arabs\" and \"Africans\", pitting Muslims against Christians and herders against farmers . </p> <p>Before we jump to the conclusion that benevolent invasion, however, is the natural consequence of our new-found humanitarian duties, we should remember that this won't be the first time that either Britain or the US has intervened in Sudan. An earlier moral crusade, the \"war against slavery\", provided much of the ostensible justification for British colonisation of the region at the end of the 19th century. Britain's disastrous southern policy, inaugurated in 1929, made permanent the long-standing division between a relatively prosperous (mainly Muslim) northern territory and a much poorer (mainly animist or Christian) southern territory. The war that began between these two territories even before the British abandoned the colony in 1956 entered its most violent phase shortly after the Americans began backing, in the late 70s, the flagging regime of Sudan's increasingly reactionary General Gaafar Nimeiri. </p> <p>The resulting chaos created the conditions for the Taliban-style reaction whose effects continue to shape the situation even today. In Sudan, the backlash against US meddling came in the form of Hassan al-Turabi's National Islamic Front, and in 1989 a new regime took over, an unstable combination of Turabi's NIF and another military clique led by general Omar al-Bashir. Bashir and Turabi turned Sudan against its cold war ally, strengthened the divisive enforcement of Islamic law and devoted new resources to the assault on the underdeveloped south. </p> <p>Despite this history, until the public relations war in Iraq started going so badly a couple of months ago it seemed that Sudan might have done enough to ward off further US hostility. Since 1997, the country has adhered to a strict IMF restructuring plan that has seen foreign investment and oil exports (along with arms imports) soar. Since 9/11, Bashir has provided the US with a steady stream of much-vaunted intelligence. Apparent progress over the last couple of years towards a power-sharing peace accord between Bashir and John Garang in the south allowed George Bush to trumpet a rare foreign policy success, one that finally offered US investors the prospect of access to Sudan's oil. </p> <p>But Bush's opportunity to adopt an election-season cause that can appeal, simultaneously, to fundamentalist Christians, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, multilateralist liberals and the altruistic \"left\" may now be too tempting to pass up. </p> <p>The crisis in Darfur clearly meets several of the criteria that must apply before Blair and his allies feel morally obliged to put an end to the abuse of \"universal\" human rights. First of all, the aggressor should be off the payroll: this rules out Turkey, Indonesia, Colombia, Israel. More importantly, the victims to be saved should lack an organised, militant movement. This rules out Palestine. Failing that, these victims should appear as helpless refugees in the wake of such a movement's defeat - this is why we are talking about intervention now rather than during the spring of 2003. </p> <p>Finally, there should be little prospect of any awkward political issue interfering with the primary purpose of such humanitarian missions, namely the moral validation of western power. This has long been enough to exclude genuine concern about the sale of arms, the spread of Aids, the consequences of structural adjustment policies and the ruinous terms of international trade. </p> <p>The rest of us should not pretend, though, that another round of \"humanitarian intervention\" would represent anything other than the soft face of that same imperialism so hard at work today in Gaza, Afghanistan and Iraq. Fresh from an illegal and deceitful war of aggression, Anglo-US forces now have only one moral responsibility: to stay at home. </p> <p>The alternative is certainly not passive resignation. We should fund the immediate and forceful deployment of African peacekeepers and build on the example recently set by Paul Kagame's Rwanda. We should help the African Union become an effective and independent political actor, capable of brokering equitable political solutions to the long-standing conflicts that western intervention, almost always, has only helped provoke. We should press our governments to reverse the policies that contribute to poverty and violence in Sudan and its neighbours. </p> <p>Most importantly, we should learn to approach conflicts like the wars in Sudan in terms of actors and principle rather than victims and confusion. Where they exist, we should lend direct political support to movements working for justice and equality. </p> <p>Had we been serious about the claims of Darfur's farmers for a more equitable distribution of wealth, we should have explored ways of contributing to their non-violent pursuit, or else supported the Sudan Liberation Army when it launched its initially successful rebellion in February 2003 - not simply waited to provide charity to its survivors in the refugee camps of 2004. </p> <p>And if we are still serious about the SLA's claims now, then we should debate their merits and decide whether, and how, to help those struggling to achieve them. This is a political question before it is a moral or humanitarian one. Today's humanitarian crisis is precisely a result of past political failure. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:peter.hallward@kcl.ac.uk\">Peter Hallward</a> teaches at King's College London and is the author of Absolutely Postcolonial.</p>",
  "A jury acquitted the Haitian former paramilitary leader Louis-Jodel Chamblain of murder yesterday after a 14-hour trial that caused outrage among human rights groups, who have attacked the country's US-backed government. <p>Mr Chamblain and his co-defendant, Jackson Joanis, were cleared of the murder of Antoine Izmery, a former justice minister and financier of the former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, according to Stanley Gaston, a defence lawyer. </p> <p>Viles Alizar of the National Coalition for Haitian Rights, said eight witnesses had been called by the prosecution but only one had appeared, saying he knew nothing about the case. For the defence, two defence witnesses had been present, but they provided few details. </p> <p>Jury selection began on Monday morning and journalists were told the day would likely be devoted to it. </p> <p>Mr Chamblain was remanded to face another trial over the killings of several people in a pro-Aristide stronghold in northern Gonaives in 1994. Mr Joanis, a former police chief in Port-au-Prince, was also held to face murder charges over the killing of the Rev Jean-Marie Vincent, a pro-Aristide priest who was shot leaving his office in 1994. It could be another month before the pair's next trial, Mr Gaston said. </p> <p>Mr Chamblain was a co-leader of the paramilitary Front for the Advancement and Progress of the Haitian People, a group that was blamed for some 3,000 killings from 1991 to 1994, during the regime that followed Mr Aristide's first ousting in 1991. </p> <p>When US troops came to the country in 1994 to restore Mr Aristide, Mr Chamblain fled to neighbouring Dominican Republic. In 1995 he was convicted in absentia and given two life sentences for his alleged role in the 1993 assassination of Izmery and the 1994 killings of scores of Aristide supporters. </p> <p>Haitian law provides that people judged in their absence have a right to a new trial if they return.</p>",
  "Behind the obvious and short-term political tinge to the US troop redeployment announced by George Bush on Monday lies a new global view of American power for the 21st century, still fumbling and imprecise but laden with significance. The actual withdrawal of up to 70,000 troops mostly from Germany and South Korea is not so crucial and will only take place over the next 10 years. The announcement may make US personnel and their dependents feel a little bit happier - the White House says that the plan will \"give service members more time on the home front\" and will require military spouses to make fewer job changes. At a time when so many \"service members\" are having their tours of duty compulsorily extended in Iraq and Afghanistan, it does no harm to the president to be seen appearing to be in favour, even in a remote sense, of bringing some boys (and girls) home. <p>Yet in the terms set out by Mr Bush, \"reducing the stress on our troops\" is only an appendage to the main objective. This is to deploy \"a more agile and more flexible force\" capable of \"surg[ing] quickly to deal with unexpected threats\" around the world. In Pentagon jargon, it is about a realignment of the US \"global defence posture\" which began with its quadrennial defence review three years ago. The goal of greater mobility does not mean reduction of bases abroad but their \"repositioning\" in locations now judged to be more secure and better located to deal with \"new threats\".</p> <p>As explained in a defence department background briefing on Monday, it may be goodbye to those massive permanent bases with schools and PXs in Germany and Spain, while a whole range of smaller new facilities are set up with a wider geographical reach. Some will be \"forward operating sites that are warm facilities\" - that is, kept warm by pre-positioned US force elements. There will also be \"more austere facilities for training, for exercises, for interactions\". The plan, says the White House, will \"make America safer\" by better preparing the military to address the new dangers associated with \"rogue nations, global terrorism and weapons of mass destruction\". Cutting fixed costs on the expensive bases also will allow more to be spent on state-of-the-art weaponry.</p> <p>Where are these new facilities, warm or austere, going to be located, and with whom does the US military intend to \"interact?\" Some existing bases, especially those in ultra-safe locations, will actually be expanded. They include Guam, which is described as being \"in an advantageous part of the Pacific.\" Other warm facilities will be located on the territories of new post-cold war allies particularly in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. New allies can be more compliant than old ones too. They already include Poland, Romania and Uzbekistan - regardless in the last case of its appalling human rights record. Africa, where conditions are seen as less stable, is only deemed suitable for a more \"austere\" facility.</p> <p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, while critics of US policy argued that it was time for cold war alliances to be wound up, supporters of Washington expressed their fears that American power might withdraw to the heartland. More recently, the British government's case for the invasion of Iraq has relied heavily on the supposed danger that a US snubbed by the world would turn inwards. These arguments about likely isolationism are now anachronistic. In Washington's strategy, defence of the heartland requires a global reach. The US needs to be not just over here, but over everywhere. The only powers able to challenge this aim, Russia and China, have signed up to the war against terror and their concerns are muted - at least for now. For them, America's assertive global role will be a salient and disquieting feature of an uncertain new world.</p>",
  "Oprah Winfrey, one of America's wealthiest women and most recognisable faces, has accepted a $17.20 (\u00a39.40) a day job after being picked to do jury duty at a murder trial in Chicago. <p>The queen of the TV confessional strode into the courthouse in Chicago on Monday carrying a copy of Anna Karenina and bringing the kind of excitement not seen in this courthouse since singer R Kelly first appeared there two years ago in a child pornography case. </p> <p>She told ABC news: \"I'm just hoping it doesn't take longer than a week because I've got shows to do.\" For a moment it looked as though she might get turned down for the job of deciding if Dion Coleman shot Walter Holley to death in February 2002 over a counterfeit $50 note. </p> <p>The court interview started out fine. When asked to tell a little bit about herself, Winfrey, 50, said: \"I have a little talk show that is my main source of work,\" before adding that at one point she owned nine dogs but was now down to just two cocker spaniels. </p> <p>But then she hesitated when asked if she could be objective if the defendant decided not to testify. \"I'm not sure about not hearing both sides,\" Winfrey told Judge James Linn. </p> <p>\"Are you told why the person doesn't testify?\" she asked. \"No,\" said Judge Linn, before explaining why and asking, \"Are you OK with that? Can you be a fair woman?\" </p> <p>\"Yes,\" said Winfrey, after a long pause. \"You're hesitating,\" said the judge, and asked the same question again. \"Why, yes,\" said Winfrey. </p> <p>The billionairess took her place alongside a woman who did not finish high school, a man once charged with unlawful use of a weapon and another who works for a pest control agency. While some read, Winfrey checked her handheld computer. She took a side door while others took the front. </p> <p>Winfrey, asked whether gory details in the trial - which starts today would trouble her, answered with a shrug. \"Everything I could hear in a trial I've already heard on my show,\" she said. \"I've met a lot of interesting people ... and got some show ideas.\"</p>",

Tom Hanks, playing very effectively against type, is chief enforcer of Paul Newman's mob in depression-era Chicago; but when his son Tyler Hoechlin sees something he didn't oughta, he has to turn against his boss.

  "A wildlife expert was seriously injured by a man who mistook his night vision binoculars for a fox's eyes and shot him, Aylesbury crown court was told yesterday. <p>Anthony Burns saw a red reflection in his binoculars and, believing he was looking into the eyes of a fox, began to shoot. </p> <p>But he had actually caught a glimpse of the night vision binoculars being used by Tony Lawson in the countryside near Chesham, Buckinghamshire, in April. </p> <p>With a bullet in the chest, Mr Lawson lay on the grass, close to death, and frantically pressed the redial button on his phone to try to raise his wife. </p> <p>\"I'm going to die,\" he said into the phone. \"I've been shot, I'm going to die, I love you.\" </p> <p>Mr Burns, 52, denies the charge of grievous bodily harm. </p> <p>Mr Lawson, a former member of the conservation board for the Chilterns area of outstanding natural beauty, spent two days in intensive care, and had to have a lung removed. </p> <p>The court was told that Mr Burns and two friends had already shot one fox when the near-fatal accident happened. </p> <p>Mr Lawson heard the shots while walking his dog in the fields near the village of Hyde Heath, Buckinghamshire, and thought there might be poachers in the area. </p> <p>He returned with the pair of night vision binoculars with which he usually watched badgers. He soon realised that the shots were from legitimate night hunters, but decided to stay out looking for wildlife. </p> <p>At about 11pm he raised his binoculars to look at the red light sweeping the field and felt immediately as though he was a \"rabbit in the headlights\". </p> <p>He lowered his binoculars to call to whoever was using the light. Seconds later he was shot, he said. </p> <p>Neil Moore, prosecuting, told the jury that the guidelines for night shooting specifically stated that hunters should ensure that an animal's profile was visible before firing. </p> <p>Hearing Mr Lawson's cries, the hunters rushed to him, realising what had happened. </p> <p>The hearing, before Judge Christopher Tryer, continues today.</p>",
  "<p>Let's face it. Being a check-in assistant for British Airways is not a very appealing job. It involves unsocial hours in bleak, noisy terminals, coping with frequently frazzled passengers under stressful conditions. Speed is of the essence and the queues are never-ending. </p> <p>Holidaymakers who turn up at airports are often on edge, unsettled by an early rise and an unfamiliar journey. Frequent travellers are likely to be abrupt and impatient, irritated by the stupid questions check-in staff are obliged to ask. </p> <p>One rightwing newspaper yesterday sneered that the job is no more skilled than working at a supermarket check-out. But Asda girls are not expected to keep an eye out for terrorists. Nor do they routinely encounter hostile mobs of delayed passengers, rowdy stag parties, customers who barely speak a word of English and sloppy packers who fail to grasp the concept of excess baggage. </p> <p>For their troubles, BA's staff receive as little as \u00a312,500 a year. Some reports have alleged that the average is closer to \u00a320,000. But unions point out that such sums are usually achieved by taking up the virtually unlimited overtime on offer because of a constant shortage of staff. </p> <p>So conditions are difficult. But does it really make them ill? To the extent that they have to take an average of three weeks' sick leave a year? The average BA worker is ill for a staggering 17 working days annually. As one insider pointed out, this means that for each BA employee who makes it through a year in rude health, the airline employs somebody else who takes 34 days off. </p> <p>BA's offer yesterday was an elegant solution. Staff who stick to a maximum of 16 \"duvet days\" over two years will get a bonus of \u00a31,000. </p> <p>This, along with an 8.5% rise over three years, is a reasonable offer against a backdrop of continuing uncertainty about BA's prospects. </p> <p>Soaring fuel prices and furious price competition on European routes mean BA staff must be sensible. The unions should cash in their chips and accept their winnings. </p> <p><strong> Executive aid </strong><br> </p> <p>At the other end of the pay scale, just how hard can it be to decide on the right rate for a boardroom job, a motivational incentive scheme and a pension deal that will allow an executive a comfortable retirement? </p> <p>Huge pay deals and vast rewards for failure have, quite rightly, cranked up the pressure on remuneration commit tees to halt the \"you pat my back and I'll pat yours\" pay deals. </p> <p>As a result, many now hire not just one but up to five firms of pay advisers in order to find formulas acceptable to both management and shareholders - who cares if the employees are still hacked off? </p> <p>Their rationales, justifications and explanations stretch over acres of annual report documents. </p> <p>As if that were not enough, there is now a newly formed Remuneration Committee Institute, sponsored by KPMG, which produces its own Remuneration Committee Journal - which is just begging for an airing on Have I Got News For You.</p> <p>The first issue, out now, includes several must-read articles for the conscientious committee member. </p> <p>How about \"Performance anxiety\" - an evaluation of relative total shareholder return as a reliable performance indicator? </p> <p>For those who need to share and build on these topics, the institute - which has 200 members - has a whole series of forums and seminars lined up through to the spring. </p> <p>In addition to this \"practical support\", the institute is also - and we are not making this up - \"an opportunity to share experiences and thoughts around the perspectives of boards, investors and other stakeholders through a range of channels\". </p> <p>There is even a helpline, presumably for committee members for whom a long and painful suicide suddenly looks distinctly more attractive than the next board meeting. </p> <p>And are shareholders happy? No. The journal also lists 64 new or altered corporate share plans introduced in April and May. </p> <p>Of those, 28 were either amber or red topped - that is, they were given a loud raspberry - by the Association of British Insurers. </p> <p><strong> On side, overheard </strong><br> </p> <p>Vodafone has renewed its deal with David Beckham, despite his alleged penchant for raunchy texts with women other than his wife.

  "A delegation from Iraq's first national conference will today travel to the holy city of Najaf in a bold attempt to broker a peace deal with the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. <p>The group of Iraqi politicians will set off from Baghdad in a fleet of minibuses, pursuing an initiative first suggested by a distant relative of the cleric, Sayed Hussain al-Sadr. </p> <p>The move came after the Najaf fighting dominated a meeting in the Iraqi capital where 1,300 political and religious leaders had gathered to agree a new assembly to oversee Iraq's interim government. </p> <p>In Najaf itself, the fighting between Mr Sadr's Mahdi army and US and Iraqi government forces appeared to have eased off. </p> <p>There were skirmishes near the Imam Ali mosque, where Mr Sadr's supporters are dug in, and in the nearby cemetery. </p> <p>Yesterday's proposal came after Hussein al-Sadr, an ally of the US, appealed for an end to the 12-day uprising in Najaf, which has plunged Iraq's interim prime minister, Iyad Allawi, into his worst crisis so far, damaging his authority. </p> <p>\"We will deliver this urgent call from the national conference to Moqtada al-Sadr to try to solve this problem at its roots,\" Hussein al-Sadr, a political opponent of the cleric, said on the sidelines of the three-day meeting. </p> <p>The delegation would urge Moqtada al-Sadr to leave the Imam Ali shrine and it would also ask him to convert his Mahdi army into a peaceful political party, he said. </p> <p>As part of the deal Moqtada al-Sadr's supporters would be granted an amnesty by the Iraqi courts. No militia could be allowed to operate in Iraq outside the rule of law, Hussein al-Sadr added. </p> <p>\"This is an urgent call to Moqtada. I regard it as a holy mission. The holy shrine in Najaf is not the property of one person but belongs to the Iraqi people,\" he said. </p> <p>Last night Said Adnan al-Saafi, Moqtada al-Sadr's press spokesman, told the Guardian that the cleric welcomed the talks and wanted a \"peaceful solution\" to the crisis. </p> <p>But he said the cleric was \"not optimistic\" these latest negotiations would succeed following the collapse of talks with Iraq's interim government over the weekend. </p> <p>\"He welcomes the delegation obviously and we hope and pray that this critical situation can be resolved,\" Mr Saafi said. \"But if the government uses the same tactics as last time we can't be optimistic.\" </p> <p>Other Iraqi politicians welcomed the new talks. They also hinted that this was Moqtada al-Sadr's last chance. </p> <p>\"He will see sense and accept the deal,\" the interim deputy prime minister, Barham Salih, said. </p> <p>\"The situation around the holy shrine cannot be allowed to continue. This is a vital mission. We have to stop the bloodshed and move on,\" Fawzi Hamzsa, who is likely to lead today's delegation to Najaf, added. </p> <p>Mr Sadr's militia has previously called for the US military to withdraw, for the city to be placed under the control of religious clerics, for the release of militia prisoners, and for permission for his movement to take part in next year's general elections. </p> <p>According to Iraqi government sources, Mr Sadr will be offered the chance to convert his movement into any kind of political party he wants - and to choose its \"name and structure\". The UN's special envoy to Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, meanwhile, told the BBC he was also willing to mediate in the crisis. </p> <p>Yesterday's initiative came amid further violence in Iraq and the kidnapping of another western journalist, this time in the southern city of Nasiriya. </p> <p>Micah Jaren, a French journalist with an American passport, was seized while walking through the market with his Iraqi translator, the TV station al-Jazeera reported. </p> <p>The translator's family reported the two missing, Adnan al-Shoraify, the deputy governor of Dhi Qar province, which includes the city, said Mr Jaren was apparently on assignment in Iraq for an American archaeology magazine. </p> <p>In other violence, two civilians were killed and four injured in Baquba when a mortar hit their house. It was not known who fired the mortar but insurgents often clash with US troops in the city. </p> <p>A roadside bomb in Baquba also wounded three members of the Iraqi National Guard, said Zuhair Abdul-Kareem, a guardsman who was injured in the blast.</p>",

Hopes that the handover of sovereignty and, with it, the lower visibility of foreign troops would bring calm to Iraq have proved vain.

Interestingly enough, neither Mr Sadr nor any other group waging the current waves of insurgency in Iraq has ever called for the resignation of the president of Iraq, Ghazi al-Yawar ... </p> <p>\"There are persistent reports that deep divisions already exist between Mr Yawar and Mr Allawi ... The discord between them surfaced again recently, during the truce talks in Najaf - Mr Yawar leaning towards more flexibility in negotiating with Mr Sadr ... The president may indeed hold the key to restoring normalcy in the country once he decides to become more politically involved. As a tribal leader with millions of followers in Iraq, Mr Yawar's role has yet to be fully tested.

  "There was a time when the most Doreen Morris could hope for was filling white people's bellies and cleaning up their mess. To be black in apartheid South Africa was to be limited in opportunity, if not hope, especially when home was a tin shack in a township gangland. Morris did have books - Noddy, the Secret Seven, the Famous Five - but they were borrowed from the white family that employed her mother as a maid. A day of scrubbing, cooking and child-minding earned one rand. When she became a teenager, Morris rolled up her sleeves to follow her mother into domestic work. \"She told me to take pride in it, as if my life depended on it.\" <p>One look at Morris's fingernails today and you know the story did not end there. Long, gleaming, narrowing to delicate tips, they are flawless. Sunglasses rest on her head, a gold watch gleams on her wrist and her white and cream outfit could be from a fashion supplement. There's a coffee table with hardback books on Salvador Dali on one side, a piano on the other, and the 46-year-old is sunk into a sofa in the sun-dappled living room of her Johannesburg mansion. As she chats, her grammar as polished as the piano, there is an audible bustle from the kitchen where a pot is being filled with water followed by what sounds like vegetables being chopped. The domestic help at work. In South African parlance this makes Morris, the employer, a madam. </p> <p>She is not alone. A decade after the collapse of apartheid, a new generation of black achievers has emerged to claim what used to be the preserve of the whites: good jobs, fancy cars, lawn sprinklers, foreign holidays. You see them clicking on their high heels through Sandton's malls, shooting down the N3 in their BMWs to spend weekends in Durban, gabbing into Nokias at Cape Town's restaurants. </p> <p>For these children of the revolution, few things embody success more than having domestic help. Their parents, denied a decent education and discriminated against in the workplace, often had no alternative to a lifetime of gardening, child-minding, cooking and cleaning. In less than a generation, that legacy has been swept away and a new black elite is wearing the employer's suit. </p> <p>The adjustment can be awkward since more blacks are poorer and jobless now than ever before, and hiring someone to clean up after you has not been part of black culture. \"It was uncomfortable to have someone doing things for me - I'm not an invalid,\" says Morris. \"I guess I'm a bit of a pleb in that way.\" </p> <p>She still makes her own bed, packs her own bag for trips and chips in when her domestic, Thulisile Ngwenya, is juggling chores. For cooking and cleaning five days a week, 8am - 5.30pm, the 30-year-old single mother is paid \u00a3180 a month, well above average. Ngwenya professes to be delighted. However some domestics expect preferential treatment from black employers, said Morris. \"They think standards should not be as exacting.\" </p> <p>Morris's path to to the position of madam was unusual. Despite her mother's pride in her work, Morris did not enjoy it and saved money for further education. She landed a job as a receptionist and secretary before catching the eye of managers at the state broadcaster, SABC, who made her the first black continuity announcer in the Afrikaans service. She moved to a private broadcaster, MNet, travelled to Cannes and Hollywood buying programmes and is now an entrepreneur with a freshly minted MBA from Australia and a husband who is chief executive officer of a company. </p> <p>More typical of the new breed of madam is Nomsa Philiso, 35, who exploited the relaxation of apartheid towards the end of that era, to obtain tertiary education. She is a financial manager - not rich but comfortably middle-class with a BMW and townhouse not far from her Soweto origins. A single mother, Philiso pays a woman to clean her house twice a week. </p> <p>Black madams have to tread carefully, she says. \"More often than not, we start the base wrong. We don't get into a formal relationships that say: here are the boundaries, you are there, I am here. More often than not, we find ourselves with domestics who are slightly older than us, and they start assuming a motherly/sisterly role which immediately disempowers you to give instructions. In our culture, there is no upward delegation, and no matter what your standing, you show respect to the elders. Whites don't have this cultural issue of trying to humanise the working relationship.\" </p> <p>Ever since European settlers landed in Western Cape and corralled some natives to help around the stockade, treatment of domestic workers has been a South African touchstone. At first they were slaves, then servants, then maids, and when that sounded too old-fashioned, they became housekeepers. The advent of black employers is testament to the success of the new South Africa. </p> <p>So it comes as a bit of a shock to find that they have a terrible reputation.\"The blacks are worse than the whites,\" says Eunice Dhladhla, a third-generation domestic and now assistant secretary general of the South Africa Domestic Service and Allied Workers' Union. \"They're mean and arrogant - even employers who are ANC MPs, our so-called comrades.\" Sit in at the union's dingy office, a fourth-floor den without lifts or landlines in downtown Johannesburg, and it could be the 70s, with tales of unpaid wages, 90-hour weeks and summary dismissals, and black and Indian employers are the worst offenders. </p> <p>Union members paint a consistent picture of exploitation. Gladys Pokane, 36, says that she has learned not to trust her \"sisters\". Muriel Gugu, 33, has resolved to work only for whites. Monica Ntuli, 45, complains about \"old, old women being made to work so hard, too hard\". Selina Vilakazi, a union case officer for Gauteng province, says blacks treat her members \"like slaves\". Many tales are hearsay, gossip gleaned on minibus taxis and accepted as fact even by those who have never worked for blacks, but there is no doubt that they are believed. </p> <p>In a rare academic study of the topic several years ago, based on questionnaires sent to 500 madams and interviews with 20 domestics, psychologist Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela found that domestics faced a lack of respect in black households and that some felt a loss of womanhood and dignity. </p> <p>One of the country's biggest placement agencies says 85% of the women on its books, virtually all black, refuse to work for people the same colour. \"The moment you mention it's a black family they say no thanks. They say black madams are unreliable - the pay drops and conditions change,\" says the owner, who does not want the company to be identified. \"White employers can be appalling but rich black ones are notorious for a sense of impunity. They regard themselves as a law unto themselves and think they can sweep anything under the carpet.\" He recalls a roomful of domestics exploding into laughter when one of them mimicked the airs and graces of a sister-turned madam. </p> <p>A raft of progressive laws stipulating working conditions and a minimum wage is supposed to have ushered in a new era for South Africa's 800,000 domestics. About a 10th of the country's estimated million employers are black. Within a decade they are expected to be the majority. </p> <p>Ann Boshoff, head of the South African Homemakers Organisation, says things are improving as more employers are educated about their responsibilities but she concedes there is a problem. \"It's not something we like to say out loud but it's true, there is a lot of exploitation. It's across all colours but we get most complaints about blacks and Indians.\" </p> <p>Relationships between black South Africans and Indians have been fraught since labourers and professionals from the sub-continent landed in Durban over a century ago, with even the young Mahatma Gandhi expressing contempt for \"indolent\" natives. In turn, Indians were branded stingy taskmasters and the stereotype endures. </p> <p>With inequality rivalling Brazil's, those blacks who have made it, from billionaire mining magnates to Soweto shopkeepers, find themselves crunching on the same eggshells of resentment. Writing in these pages earlier this year Justice Malala, editor of the Johannesburg daily This Day, pondered his escape from poverty and move to a formerly white suburb where nannies and gardeners used to be the only blacks. \"New black arrivals like me now agonise about not treating our domestic workers the way our mothers were treated as workers in these suburbs.\" </p> <p>One explanation is that black employers often tap extended families in rural areas to bring a cousin or niece to the city. Long hours and meagre pay may be viewed as a quid pro quo for being saved from rotting in KwaZulu-Natal without hope or prospects. The other explanation is newness to the game. According to the labour movement it took decades to drill into whites the notion of responsibilities - something many still resist - and the same process of education is only starting with blacks. </p> <p>Back in her mansion, Doreen Morris says that she and her black friends go out of their way to treat their staff with dignity. Memories of her childhood in a windswept township on the Cape Flats endure, so it hurt when the domestic of a white friend she was visiting refused to clean up after her, saying she had a policy against working for fellow blacks. \"I was completely taken aback. She was very vociferous.\" </p> <p>However, while she says she is uncomfortable with her position as a madam, \"I don't have a constant feeling of guilt about it. I think it's good for the economy.\"</p>",
  "<b>Foreign affairs</b> <br> <p><b>All the president's women</b><br> \"Thank God President Bush is there because otherwise we would still be vulnerable now,\" Sherry Huffman says, tears in her eyes. A local branch of the Texas Federation of Republican Women (\"the footsoldiers of the party,\" as one describes them) is meeting in Austin, the capital of Bush's home state, and Sherry is joined by around 20 other women, all between the ages of 45 and 60. Some have brought their husbands along to Tres Amigos Tex-Mex restaurant and the small function room is a sea of bold earrings and finely manicured nails. </p> <p>Far from being a group of coffee-morning mums organising jumble sales, the National Federation of Republican Women has become one of the largest women's political organisations in the US, with a grassroots membership of 100,000. When Bush announced his candidacy in 1999, he told the Texas Federation: \"I know how important you are to my campaign. I would not have won my elections in Texas without your help.\" </p> <p>\"I'm trying to understand the hatred towards President Bush but I just can't,\" Sherry says. \"My daughter saw him on the campaign trail for the last election and told me he stopped his car and bought lemonade for all his staff. He's so down to earth and real, but that didn't get reported in the media.\" </p> <p>Nancy believes Bush is \"a very moral man and a good Christian. It's going to be a tough race,\" she says between mouthfuls of enchiladas, \"and the war is going to have a lot to do with it - I think people too easily forget September 2001. They forget about 3,000 people that were killed and the reasons we went to war.\" </p> <p>\"We're well educated when it comes to politics because we've listened to Rush for 15 years,\" her husband Bobby interjects, referring to rightwing talkshow host Rush Limbaugh, a key voice in support of the Bush campaign. </p> <p>\"The United States is the only thing standing between tyranny and the rest of the world now,\" Carol Hanle adds almost breathlessly. \"We saved Europe from Hitlerism and now we're saving the rest of the world from fundamentalist Muslims who will do anything to get where they want to go - even kill children. If people don't start to get behind Bush and stop the negativism, they're going to get theirs.\" </p> <p>\"Look what we did to save France's rear end,\" her friend, Susan Monroe, says. \"If they get in a mess again we will be there again to help them because Americans are the most loving people, but we're tired of getting spat on.\" </p> <p>Her friend Suzanne says when she visited Europe recently she couldn't find anyone with anything nice to say about America. \"I think that's very sad,\" she says. \"I get tired of hearing my country run down all the time. Look how many of our men are buried in Normandy. If it weren't for the US, you'd be speaking German by now.\" <br><b>Alex Hannaford</b> </p> <p><b>Filthy lucre</b><br> </p> <p><b>Diamonds are for Trevor</b><br> Is your darling wearing a diamond tiara? Does he resemble Joan Collins in Sins? De Beers have announced that sales of rough gems have risen by 7% in the first six months of this year - they rose 6% throughout the 90s - and diamond dealers declare that the surplus is not gracing feminine fingers. </p> <p>Today it is boys, not debutantes, who are throwing themselves through the bullet-proof doors of Graff, Tiffany, Asprey's, Cartier and Garrard, seeking tears of the gods and their four magic Cs - colour, clarity, cut and carat. There's \"a definite growth trend in the market for all types of men's jewellery,\" says Garrard's marketing director, Simon Williamson. </p> <p>Graff offers men a galaxy of \u00a31m diamonds, all as big as the Ritz. It sells earrings, pendants and bangles, or diamond buttons for his dress shirt. Its mysterious bespoke service can render pink diamond suits for European gentlemen of questionable sanity. Garrard the crown jeweller is proffering the Playboy range of bunny cufflinks with diamond eyes. Its Knightrider collection includes a lion's head charm with white diamond eyes for the hairy wrist. </p> <p>Why are the men all glittering now? Can we blame it on the gangster rappers and their Kilburn and Brooklyn acolytes, who invented the word bling to describe the light that bounces off P Diddy's diamonds? Can we acknowledge the oestrogen in the Thames (all the fish are girls now, they say), footballers waxing their armpits, or the marriage of Beckham to Posh and the ensuing global feminisation of the male? Is it Nadia's Big Brother? David Blunkett? Astrology? Search your wardrobe for the answer; but jewels for men are back. </p> <p>Bling is not a novelty. It is a renaissance. Men have always worn jewellery when they could mine, steal or wear it well. The court portraits of Henry VIII, Louis XIV and Edward VII are heavy with bling. Pirates were partial to a spot of bling with their parrots and their pieces of eight. When Charles III is anointed king he will wear the imperial state crown, with its blinding 2,868 diamonds. That is bling cubed. </p> <p>Can we ask in this metrosexual time - does it actually suit them? Is a man in a crown and a necklace sexy? Does he look any better in diamonds than he would in stockings and suspenders and a pair of pumps? Or a Jaeger two-piece? I think jewels look better on women but emancipation is deaf. Zsa Zsa Gabor said she \"never hated a man enough to give back his diamonds\". Today, she wouldn't have been given them in the first place.<br><b>Tanya Gold</b> </p> <p><b>Time off</b><br> </p> <p><b>A costly nap</b><br> On the 24th floor of the Empire State Building, wreathed in darkness, stand eight white pods of the sort that in science fiction movies give birth to terrible slobbering creatures. Relax, lie back. The switch on the right elevates your feet and knees. The one on the left controls lighting. New age music pipes though the headphones. First it sounds like the ocean, and then like someone with exquisite self-control breaking wind in a bath. Hopefully, you fall asleep. </p> <p>Twenty minutes later, your pod vibrates, the realm of Morpheus evaporates, and you're relieved of about $14 by a company called Metronaps, which has hit upon the idea of selling sleep to the city that never sleeps. \"Do More With Your Day\", says the business card of self-proclaimed avid napper and Metronaps co-owner, Christopher Lindholst. Lindholst and his business partner - both MBAs - got their idea from watching Manhattan's Masters of the Universe execute nosedives into their briefing notes, or creep off to the loo for 40 winks. A nap's duration, says Lindholst, is crucial. An hour and a half leaves you groggy, and may eat into your night's sleep. Twenty minutes, however, and you feel like Superman, or at least a bit more like him. </p> <p>Dr Jerome Siegel of UCLA's Centre for Sleep Research is unconvinced. He says he doesn't know of any studies that stipulate the optimal nap-time as being 20 minutes, though he allows politely that they might exist. And naps aren't for everyone, he adds. If you're narcoleptic, a nap refreshes. If you have sleep apnoea - or wake often - naps won't provide any benefit. So is Metronaps selling something worthwhile? \"Sure, why not?\" Siegel laughs. </p> <p>Lindholst disputes that he is simply providing for a cost what the subway and colleagues' suit lapels have traditionally supplied free of charge. Metronaps offers superior service. \"Everything here,\" he says, \"from the pods, which are scientifically designed, to the colours, to the lighting, to the lemon-scented towels at the end, has been chosen for power napping.\" </p> <p>When I visited during siesta time the empty room seemed melancholic, like a deserted church. Then two middle-aged men appeared, scouting locations for a science fiction flick they said was being shot on \"a 'Doctor Who' budget\". Then Kevin, a 28-year-old lawyer with a large midtown firm, walked in. He had been working for three days straight. After emerging from the pod, he said: \"If you really want to take a nap and can't do it at the office, this place is great.

  "<p>Newcastle United made it known yesterday that they will sell Kieron Dyer to any club prepared to offer \u00a38m for the England midfielder, who refused to start on the right wing at Middlesbrough on Saturday. </p> <p>Only last summer Dyer was being discreetly marketed at \u00a315m and the plunge in his price reflects Newcastle's eagerness to off-load him before the transfer window shuts at the end of this month. </p> <p>Some senior figures within St James' Park hope Dyer will never play for Newcastle again after he refused to comply with his manager's request to play wide on the right at the Riverside, and Freddy Shepherd, the club chairman, is also well aware that selling him now would make good business sense. </p> <p>Dyer, who on \u00a365,000 a week ranks among Newcastle's highest earners, has 18 months remaining on his contract and his sale price will depreciate swiftly. Yet with only two weeks left in which to complete transfer business time is running out and Newcastle may have to wait until January to sell him. </p> <p>Matters are further complicated by the fact that Dyer, who has joined the England squad preparing for tomorrow night's friendly against Ukraine, is unwilling to accept a pay cut and would seek assurances that any new club would offer him a regular starting place in central midfield. </p> <p>Nevertheless several managers, directors and agents convening at St James' Park for tomorrow's friendly can expect to be thoroughly sounded out about any interest in buying the 25-year-old. The outcome will determine whether Dyer submits a formal transfer request or endeavours, temporarily at least, to repair his strained relationship with Robson. </p> <p>Last year Shepherd rejected offers in the region of \u00a36m, one of them understood to be from Manchester United, for Dyer's services before making it clear his price was \u00a315m, but now risks losing him for nothing in spring 2006 if he fails to agree a new contract. </p> <p>With Dyer anxious to fill a central midfield role but Robson intending to pair Nicky Butt and Lee Bowyer or Jermaine Jenas in slots he craves, such a scenario appears highly unlikely. </p> <p>Indeed his involvement in a series of sometimes unsavoury off-the-field incidents since Ruud Gullit signed him from Ipswich for \u00a36m in 1999 have led to many at the club losing patience with him. </p> <p>It is far from certain that the manager who succeeds Robson when his contract expires next summer would welcome the sometimes disruptive dressing-room presence of a man whose penchant for an over-active social life has regularly incurred Alan Shearer's wrath. Moreover Dyer's career has been hampered by frequent injuries and he still has a steel pin in a shin that will require removal at some stage. </p> <p>But his talent is indisputable. Granted he has scored only one goal in his past 37 Premiership appearances but few coaches could fail to be impressed by a player boasting exceptional pace, adhesive close control and the increasingly rare ability to beat an opponent, who is also capable of operating in every midfield position, as a withdrawn striker and at right-back. </p> <p>The problem is that Dyer believes he is a victim of his versatility with his failure to command a regular berth in the heart of midfield hampering his chances of international selection in Sven-Goran Eriksson's side - an ensemble already replete with would-be central midfielders. </p> <p>As a \"friend\" of Dyer's told yesterday's Sun: \"It can only get worse; he will not change his mind. This is a big season for Kieron and he believes he can make the breakthrough [with England] now, especially with Paul Scholes having retired. </p> <p>\"Bobby loves him because he can play in so many different positions but that is no good to Kieron. Everyone else appears to be allowed to play where they want except him.\" </p> <p>Dyer's displeasure was all too apparent when introduced as a substitute at Middlesbrough, where his body language suggested he was ignoring Robson's instructions as he stood on the touchline. This impression was endorsed when his negligence permitted Boudewijn Zenden to deliver the cross from which Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink knocked in the late Middlesbrough equaliser that cost Newcastle victory. </p> <p>This very public show of petulance has almost certainly lost Dyer the support of many Newcastle fans but, having agreed to remunerate him so handsomely, Shepherd may struggle to rid the club of Robson's refusenik. </p> <p><strong>Dyer's goalscoring record for the Magpies</strong></p> <p><strong> Season 2000/01 </strong> <br> League - 26 games, 5 goals<br> FA Cup - 1 0 <br> League Cup - 4 1<br> <strong> Total</strong> 30 6 <br> <strong> Games per goal </strong> 5.17 </p> <p><strong>Season 2001/02 </strong> <br> League - 18 3 <br> FA Cup - 2 0 <br> League Cup - 1 0 <br> <strong> Total </strong> 21 3 <br> <strong> Games per goal </strong> 7<br></p> <p><strong> Season 2002/03 </strong> <br> League - 35 2 <br> League Cup - 1 2<br> Other - 12 2 <br> <strong> Total </strong> 48 6<br> <strong> Games per goal </strong> 8 <br></p> <p> <strong>Season 2003/04</strong> <br> League - 25 1 <br> FA Cup - 2 2 <br> Other - 7 0 <br> <strong> Total</strong> 34 3 <br> <strong> Games per goal</strong> 11.3</p>",
  "<p>As footballers age, their problems also develop. David Beckham was vilified for the red card at the 1998 World Cup but, fierce as the condemnation was, he could survive by blocking it out. The England midfielder's more recent troubles have compelled him to face himself and wider realities. He even verged on agreeing that Sven-Goran Eriksson will be replaced as manager if England are not deemed a success at the 2006 World Cup finals </p> <p>At the weekend, Beckham put his own humdrum displays at Euro 2004 down to workouts in the gym that left him heavy and muscle-laden. It was far more interesting, ahead of tomorrow's friendly with Ukraine at St James' Park, to hear him touch on the background to all that counter-productive exertion. </p> <p>\"I was just a little bit bored after training,\" he said, \"so I used to go the gym after training and my wife would have a massage.\" </p> <p>The impression is of a footballer, or even a couple, semi-assimilated, at best, into a life they had chosen hurriedly in Spain. </p> <p>England's captain claims that he feels in good condition again after keeping his hands off the dumb-bells for four months, but, more than that, he has needed to stop carrying so much mental baggage. The allegations of an affair did unsettle him at Euro 2004. </p> <p>\"The attention I've had would affect anyone,\" he said, \"and for the first time it did affect me on the pitch. My family are No 1, but football is my life. I've never really been criticised before for my on-field performance. Of course it upset me because I'm a professional.\" </p> <p>When Beckham gives a press conference, upbeat comments are as inevitable as assertions that, despite the misses, he will keep on taking penalties for England until Eriksson stops him. Despite that, there is a change in him. It is impossible to ignore a quiet acceptance that failure and rejection continue to be genuine possibilities, for him and his manager. </p> <p>He did not attempt to reject the proposition that Eriksson will have to lose his job if England's anti-climax in Portugal this summer is echoed at the 2006 World Cup. \"Probably,\" he said with a hint of bleakness. \"If you don't succeed, you are criticised. You have to be strong enough to take it. I'm strong enough and I'm sure the manager is after all he's been through.\" </p> <p>Beckham has an optimist's personality but the psychological scales were balanced with misgivings yesterday. His tale of inner renewal did not appear to have convinced even himself. Each claim of recovery was soon qualified. </p> <p>\"When I got back to England my wife cancelled everything and I just went away with my family for three weeks and did absolutely nothing. I hadn't rested with them like that for a while. I needed to do that.\" </p> <p>It was credible as far as it went, but this assertion of the value of Victoria and the children was not held out as a universal remedy. Although they may be settled with him in Madrid now, there is no pretence that he has become a cosmopolitan linguist. He nearly disputed the claim of his new Real manager Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho that his improved Spanish will help the midfielder to do better in his second year in La Liga. </p> <p>Beckham was more at ease when Carlos Queiroz was in charge at the Bernab\u00e9u and he could converse easily with him. Camacho, he said, \"only speaks a little English, so it's hard for me, but my Spanish is getting better\". </p> <p>The England captain was too frank to be an unstinting cheerleader, either, for Michael Owen, the England vice-captain who has left Liverpool to join him at Real. Beckham's mind strayed to his own uncertainties over where he would play in the side when he moved last summer. \"It's difficult to get into the team at clubs like Real Madrid,\" he said. </p> <p>The midfielder thinks that his display in the 2-0 win over Wisla Krakow in last week's Champions League qualifier was his best for five months, but he will surely warn Owen to take nothing for granted in his new life, even if Beckham does believe in the striker's talent. \"When you've got pace like he has you'll score goals and get in behind defences,\" he said. \"I don't think he'll have a problem in the Spanish league.\" </p> <p>Beckham, though, also has his own prospects to weigh up nowadays. \"I know what I've been given and talent can't disappear just like that,\" he said. \"I know that I didn't perform as I can do in those games [at Euro 2004] and I want to put that right.\" </p> <p>Even so, it was hard to tell whether this was a Beckham staring at inevitable decline or a man who will enter his final years as a player with the benefit of hard-earned wisdom.</p>",

Suffice to say, two Romanians in a row have just burned up the floor, with Oana Ban scoring 9.437. Unless their last performer has a total nightmare, I'm almost certain they'll take the gold medal. </p> <p> <strong>21:05pm:</strong> A lull at the moment in the women's gymnastics, as the teams that aren't in medal contention getting their floor routines out of the way before the United States and Romania take to the floor.

After celebrating their victory, the Mexicans heard the other group game had finished 3-3 between Mali and South Korea - a result that meant they were eliminated. </p> <p>Omar Bravo scored twice after Rafael Marquez had put the Mexicans ahead. Ioannis Taralidis replied with a penalty when his team was already 2-0 down and the second Greek goal from Ieroklis Stoltidis came in injury time with the Mexicans coasting to victory. </p> <p>The result meant Mexico finished with four points and Greece one - a sad ending for the host after its senior team had won Euro 2004 six weeks ago. But the tie in Thessaloniki gave both Mali and Korea five points each. </p> <p> <strong>20:35pm:</strong> US sprinter Torri Edwards will definitely not participate in the Games after an arbitration panel upheld her two-year drug suspension, saying she should have known tablets provided by her doctor contained a banned substance.

She inherited the world championship in the 100 when Kelli White forfeited that crown because of drug use. </p> <p><strong>20:25pm:</strong> Watching these ladies perform on the beam is like looking at a small child playing alone beside a river - nerve-wracking, yet strangely spellbinding.

Barry Glendenning here. Left all alone and in charge of this rolling report? Watching the women's team gymnastics? With <em>my</em> reputation?

Romania lead at the moment, with the Ukraine in second place and the United States in third. </p> <p>Meanwhile on the basketball court, there's more bad news for the Yanks where Allen Iverson has a broken right thumb but made the starting lineup against Greece. Team USA are hoping to, eh, bounce back from an embarrassing loss to Puerto Rico in their opener. </p> <p> <strong>7.55pm</strong> I would like to continue all night, but my colleague Barry Glendenning is champing at the bit to give you his insights into the technical merits of the gymnastics. So, I'll bid you adieu, say thank you for your emails, and leave you with the knowledge that the USA lead the women's team event, the Romanians are in second, and the Ukrainians third.</p> <p><strong>7.48pm </strong> The shocks continue on the tennis courts. Nicolas Kiefer and Rainer Schuettler have defeated Australian second seeds Wayne Arthurs and Todd Woodbridge 7-6(8-6), 6-3. Woodbridge is a perennial winner of the Wimbledon doubles, but reputation is proving to be worthless at the Olympics. In the gymnastics, the Romanians are on the asymmetric bars but not scoring as high as expected, with Monica Rosu only being awarded 9.387. America are setting the early pace.</p> <p><strong>7.37pm </strong> While we wait for the gymnastics to burst into life, Gabrielle Grundy has a question. \"Which of our plucky swimmers is from Derby? I'm living in Washington DC and this morning on television the presenter was talking to the parents of a British swimmer that was competing today. The presenter didn't even ask what their son's name was! All I know is they were from Derby. Until I found your web updates I was missing the equally impartial British coverage of the Olympics. Thank you!\" Always eager to please, Gabrielle, but sadly on this occasion I do not yet have an answer for you. I'm trailing the profiles of all our swimmers competing today but have not yet come up trumps. Can anyone out there help? And just to prove we can concentrate on non-British matters, Argentina are beating Australia 1-0 at half-time in the football, and Greece are drawing 0-0 with Mexico. Expect the Greeks to grab a 1-0 victory - they usually do.</p> <p><strong>7.25pm </strong> The women's gymnastics team event has begun, though the \"girls' team event\" would be a more apt description. A pre-pubescent Ukrainian is currently flying through the air at break-neck speed while performing a double somersault tuck. Romania are the favourites for the gold medal, though Svetlana Khorkina, comfortably the eldest of the competitors at 25, leads a strong Russian team. Barry Davies, who is almost old enough to be the great-grandfather of some of these little (4ft 11in average height) ladies, has said there is no room for any error because every score counts. There's bound to be some tears later methinks. </p> <p><strong>7.09pm </strong> I said it should be some race, and boy it certainly was. Ian Thorpe went into the last leg for Australia eight metres behind the Americans, but slowly crept up on Klete Keller, only for the US to take the gold by just 13 hundredths of a second. According to Adrian Moorhouse, Thorpe is 75% fish and 25% human.It certainly is an intriguing theory, but I for one would quite like to know how Moorhouse arrived at these figures. The Brits put in a commendable performance, narrowly missing out on third place to the Italians. That's the swimming over for another day, and the British can be relatively proud of their efforts. The BBC are currently reading out emails from viewers, which is making us feel a bit left out. </p> <p><strong>6.52pm </strong> Yana Klotchkova, of Ukraine, has won the women's 400m individual medley, adding to the gold she won in the 200m medley. The men's 4x200m freestyle relay is up next, so this is a good time to make this Olympics update international. \"South African greetings to all! Well done to home boys in the 400m freestyle relay,\" writes Caryn Voight. And greetings to you to, Caryn, and, yes, congratulations to your 400m relay winners. GB line up in lane six in the 4x200m, alongside the formidable Aussies and Americans. It should be some race.</p> <p><strong>6.40pm </strong> One of the quirks of the Olympics is that there can be a long stretch when absolutely nothing happens. Then, suddenly, there's big stories everywhere, and national anthems (usually American or Chinese) going off all around the city. Given that this is one of the latter moments, you'd think I wouldn't be wasting time with such waffle and would be hurriedly pressing my keyboard to give you the news. Well, I'm afraid I'm going to pause for a moment while Stephen Parry is presented with his bronze medal by Princess Anne. The joy on Parry's face as the Union jack climbs the pole to the sound of \"Oh say can you see...\" is a fine sight. Maybe one day we might even have the chance to listen to \"God save the Queen.\"</p> <p><strong>6.30pm </strong> Less cheery news from the pool: Briton Chris Cook has finished eighth out of eight in the first semi-final of the 200m breaststroke. Japan's Kosuke Kitayama, who won the race, was in and out of the pool, showered and on the bus back to the Olympic village by the time Cook had finished, somewhat disappointing given that BBC commentators were claiming he had the ability to follow Parry's lead. Oh, and what's this? In the second semi Ian Edmond finished fifth, but has been disqualified for an illegal kick off the wall. He's being interviewed as I write, and livid is the only way to describe his reaction.</p> <p><strong>6.18pm </strong> \"Great news, but what time did Parry get? Break any records?\" Tim Aldridge enquires. He certainly did. Parry swam 1:55.52mins, not only a British record, but also a Commonwealth record. And how did he get himself so psyched up for the final? By watching Rocky in his room, that's how. No word of a lie. For the record, Michael Phelps broke the Olympic record in 1:54.02. </p> <p><strong>6.08pm </strong> Roger Federer has tumbled from the men's singles. Tomas Berdych, of the Czech Republic, beat the world No1 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 to spring the shock of the Olympics so far. Unless you think that Brazil's women's football team beating their Greek counterparts 7-0 is a bigger surprise. No, didn't think so. Georgina Lee finished fifth in her 200m butterfly semi, narrowly missing out on tomorrow's final. But it doesn't matter, we're still living off the euphoria of winning a medal!</p> <p><strong>5.58pm BRONZE FOR PARRY </strong> Shout it from the roof-tops - we've won another medal! Stephen Parry has taken the bronze, and a big kiss from Sharon Davies, for Great Britain in the 200m butterfly. Michael Phelps won the gold as expected, but he was pushed close by Parry and Takashi Yamamoto, who finished second. Parry has said he hopes this gets the ball rolling for all our competitors. So say all of us.</p> <p><strong>5.49pm </strong> Romania's Camelia Potec has surprised everyone by winning the 100m freestyle from lane one. Frederica Pellegrini took the silver and Solenne Figues the bronze. My tip, Francisca van Almsick, was a disappointing fifth. Not surprising really. Now, for British fans, it's the big one: Britain's Stephen Parry v America's Michael Phelps. Parry beat him yesterday, but can he do it when it really matters? The Beeb's commentators are barely able to contain their excitement, and so, quite frankly, am I. And they're off...</p> <p><strong>5.45pm </strong> Alexander Popov, one of the favourites for the title, has missed out on the 100m freestyle final. Roland Mark Schoeman, of South Africa, won the second semi, while five swimmers were faster than Popov's time, squeezing the Russian out. Ian Thorpe scraped through with the eighth quickest time, while world record holder Pieter van den Hoogenband will also compete in the final. Now it's the women's 200m freestyle final, for which Britain's Melanie Marshall was the favourite coming into the games, but finished last in her semi-final. Instead Francisca van Almsick, a model from Germany, is the favourite for a first gold medal in her fourth Olympics.</p> <p><strong>5.35pm </strong> Claire Harrison writes: \"This is probably a stupid question but any chance of hearing how 'our boy Stephen' gets on against Phelps in the swimming - I think this is about to go on?\" Claire, you do yourself a disservice. The race takes place at 5.50, so stay tuned in. First, it's the men's semi-finals of the 100m freestyle, and the first one has thrown up a shock. Ian Thorpe was pushed down to third place, behind Salim Iles of Algeria. Russian legend Alexander Popov finished fourth, and is waiting anxiously for the second semi to see if he has reached the final. Adrian Moorhouse would like everyone to know that Tarzan won this event in the 1920s and also broke 53 world records.</p> <p><strong>5.25pm </strong> Despite the elimination of Tim Henman, the men's singles continues unabated. Spain's Tommy Robredo came from a set down to beat Frenchman Fabrice Santoro, while tenth seed Nicolas Massu knocked out American Vincent Spadea in straight sets. The BBC are showing Laurence Godfrey's victory in the last 16 of the archery for the third time in an hour and a half. I suppose we have to revel in what few victories we have, don't we?</p> <p><strong>5.15pm </strong> There's a pause in the action, so allow me to fill you in on tonight's swiming finals. In addition to the women's 200m freestyle, there's also the women's 200m individual medley. Britain line up in the men's 4x200m freestyle relay after impressive qualification this morning, but they will be up against the USA, and Ian Thorpe and Australia. The highlight, though, could be the 200m butterfly in which Stephen Parry has looked very impressive to date. I predicted a medal for Parry earlier, but as Frances Green has rightly pointed out: \"Just by saying this you have condemned us to another miserable failure!\"</p> <p><strong>5.00pm </strong> With troubled Greek duo Kostas Kederis and Katerina Thanou leaving hospital today, an independent assessment has revealed the sprinters are suffering from no serious injuries. Kederis merely has scratches on his shin and right elbow, while Thanou has no medical ailment whatsoever. It does make you wonder why they have been in hospital since Thursday night following their alleged motorbike accident.</p> <p><strong>4.50pm </strong> OK, I may have spoken too soon. Kellogg and Emms have lost nine points in a row since I last wrote, and are now 13-4 down in the deciding game. Meanwhile, tennis third seed Carlos Moya has beaten Olivier Rochus 6-0, 7-6(7-3) to progress to the third round. And that's it, the Chinese have won the badminton doubles. My optimism was misplaced. We're never going to win another medal.</p> <p><strong>4.40pm </strong> Donna Kellogg and Gail Emms are battling in an engrossing badminton match against two Chinese girls. Kellogg's forehand is being exposed a little, but the pair are still in the match at one set all and 5-4 down. Luke Satchell wants to know: \"What does this astounding performance by (archer) Laurence Godfrey mean for our otherwise rubbish medal chances then, Mike?\" Listen everyone, try not to get too depressed. We may only have one medal, but as Steve Cram was saying yesterday, we've still got our big sports to come. And I'm going to stick my neck on the line here and say that Stephen Parry is going to get a medal for us tonight in the butterfly. Now there's optimism for you.</p> <p><strong>4.30pm </strong> Simon Whawell (PhD no less) asks: \"Any news on the 'heroic spectator's' marks in the diving last night? I bet it will be more than the Chinese pairing (0) which brought back memories of that John Smith's advert.\" I, too, saw the rather harsh marking which resulted in a 0 for the Chinese pair. It was a tad unfair considering that earlier that evening a Chinese gymnast (his name has drifted from my memory) fell from the bar twice, and yet still notched up a 9.125 mark. Would any of you like to judge our hero's dive? Hungary have beaten Greece 33-20 in a women's volleyball group match. Yes, that really is the best I can offer you for now. News on a big women's badminton match involving our girls is coming up soon though.</p> <p><strong>4.20pm </strong> I am sitting here with my head in my hands, lifting my cranium only briefly to cut and paste the following from Fotis Kollias. \"Dear sir, There is no Marion Simitsek... The real name of CEO of Athens 2004 Organising Comittee is Marton Simitsek. And if you will meet him you will see that he has a bear... So, obviously, he is not a woman...\" Fotis, and indeed Mr Marton (yes, Mr Marton) Simitsek, you have my wholehearted apologies. Belgium's Justine Henin-Hardenne has beaten Venezuela's Maria Vento-Kabchi 6-2, 6-1 in the women's tennis singles.</p> <p><strong>4.10pm </strong> Due to the lack of wind at Piraeus, today's sailing has actually been more just floating than anything else. Paul Goodison will almost certainly have to discard today's result, as he finished a disappointing 28th. He now lies 12th overall. Brazilian Robert Scheidt - pronounce it carefully - remains top of the Laser class, and is virtually guaranteed the gold medal, particularly with his nemesis of the past two Olympics, Ben Ainslie, competing in the Finn class this time around.</p> <p><strong>4.00pm </strong> In the Panathinaiko stadium, where the modern Olympics began in 1896, British archer Laurence Godfrey has produced an outstanding performance to beat Atlanta silver medallist and one of the favourites Magnus Petersson 163-162. Housewives' favourite Craig Doyle introduced the match-up by saying it's like trying to hit a grapefruit from 70m with a bow and arrow. Pretty impressive.</p> <p><strong>3.45pm </strong> And the wily Japanese lady has taken the gold - that's her nation's fourth on the judo mat. I didn't really expect anything else. The judo news keeps coming in, with Greek Ilias Iliadis sending the home crowd wild, defeating Roman Gontyuk, of Ukraine, in double-quick time to win another gold for the hosts. It looked to me like Gontyuk was actually in control of the winning fling, but Eurosport's commentator knows more than me, and is fairly adamant the ruling is correct. Colin P feels aggrieved by Britain's paltry medal tally to date, especially as it was in synchronised diving. \"When did that become a sport? If London gets the Olympics in the next century, darts should definitely be allowed in.\" Well, Colin, I quite agree, but I should also point out that we would probably lose to Dutch duo Ray Barneveld and Roland \"The Tripod\" Scholten, and Canada's John Part, thus leaving us outside the medals once more. Oh, and off the top of my head, synchronised diving became an Olympic sport in 1996.</p> <p><strong>3.36pm </strong> It's judo now. I'm not entirely sure how they score this particularly sport, but I can tell you that it's the final of the women's under-63kg category. Ayumi Tanimoto, of Japan, is fighting Austria's Claudia Heill. There are some shoulder tosses, lots of lying on each other, and some rather rigorous arm-tugging. Sorry if you can't wait to find out who will take the gold medal, but you will have to until the next update, as this contest is still continuing. Tanimoto leads I am informed.</p> <p><strong>3.25pm </strong> Good news and bad news for British hopes. Good first. Britain's men's quad sculls managed a late surge to take them past the French and secure qualification for the semi-finals. Now the bad. Badminton medal hope Richard Vaughan has crashed out of the men's singles at the last 16 stage to Korean Seung Mo Shon 15-9, 15-4. As if that wasn't enough, Ella Tripp and Joanne Wright have compounded a poor session at the Goudi Olympic Hall for British hopes, losing in just 40 minutes to fifth-seeded Dutch pair Mia Audina and Lotte Bruil. </p> <p><strong>3.17pm </strong> Marion Simitsek is a busy woman (I presume she is a woman). Not content with dealing with love-sick loons, she is now denying vicious allegations of poisoning Athens' dogs to make the city more tourist-friendly. \"We are in close collaboration with the the proper authorities. Any dogs we do take away are sterilised and taken to places where they are fed,\" she murmured. Our athletes have arrived in Athens ahead of action beginning in the Olympic stadium this weekend. Confidence is high in the camp we are led to believe. Let's hope so because we have still only won one medal (a silver in synchronised diving), and all the other countries are starting to laugh at us.</p> <p><strong>3.07pm </strong> The heroic spectator who dived into the pool last night - the Olympics' equivalent of a streaker - did so for the love of a woman apparently. I'll let Olympics chief of operations Marion Simitsek explain: \"A man very much in love with his wife wanted to show it so he bought a ticket, came inside and chose to dive in the pool. We have taken measures so this does not happen again and we are going to put security guys around the field of play dressed in our staff dress.\" The sailing is continuing to be disrupted by the wind, or lack of it. Meanwhile, the rowing has been disrupted because of blustery conditions. Just a suggestion, but why not swap the two venues around? Oh, there is some rowing on now. It's the men's lightweight four repechage. First three through. Only one team drops out. And on the line ... it's Britain. </p> <p><strong>2.52pm</strong> Right, that's the end of me for today. My colleague Mike Adamson will now be taking over and will hopefully bring the charm and wit that has been sadly lacking during the last three hours. I'm off for my daily fix of Steve Holdsworth on Eurosport's boxing coverage.</p> <p><strong>2.42pm</strong> Apart from the fact that he's a Man Utd fan, we rather like Darren Campbell. He's courteous, pleasant and has a welcome habit of winning medals: silver in the 200m in Sydney and bronze in the 100m at the World Champioships in Paris last year. Reigning OIympic champ Maurice Greene reckons Daz can finish in the top three in this year's 100m. \"When it comes to championships that guy is always ready to compete,\" said Kansas Cannonball Greene, \"so he's going to have to be one to look out for.\" You certainly think he'd be sharper than poor old Rob Key, who has come in for some fearful japes today. Here's another from Robert Cross: \"Key would surely be a contender in Olympic wrestling, especially if competitors were told that a bag of fresh-from-the-oven doughnuts were awarded to the victor.\"</p> <p><strong>2.26pm</strong> The repechage continues to do Britain proud in the rowing. After the success of Ian Lawson earlier this afternoon, Tracy Langlands and Helen Casey made it through to Thursday's semi-finals of the lightweight women's double sculls with second place in the repechage. And ta to Luke Meddings who, in reference to my earlier use of the phrase \"a brace of flying mammals,\" writes: \"Flying mammals? Are you sure?\" He obviously hasn't noticed the winged giraffes circling above Farringdon. Thanks, Luke.</p> <p><strong>2.19pm</strong> Kayak slalom: it should be our new national sport. Especially if Stuart McIntosh can build on his promising early form in tomorrow's C1 canoeing semi-finals. McIntosh qualified in fifth place and said: \"To finish only a second-and-a-half behind the leader having performed an eskimo roll down that second run shows that I'm in good shape.\" If kayak slalom weren't to capture the imagination, which other Olympic sport would you like to see knock football off the back pages? And don't say beach volleyball.</p> <p><strong>2.06pm</strong> Confetti, champagne and caviar, of the Beluga variety, for Mr Alex Marklew, who warded off the challenge of a host of competitors to be the first to tell us the capital of Benin. \"Porto-Novo, if my GCSE geography case study serves me true,\" says a very diffident Alex. Was he the only one for whom GCSE geography did not consist merely of colouring in maps? Meanwhile, after his match-winning 93 not out yesterday, Robert Key's appeal as an Olympian continues to grow in the shires. \"The Man of Kent would be pretty special in every single event,\" says Simon Thomas. \"Especially the vault and the rings in the gymnastics.\"</p> <p><strong>1.56pm</strong> Never one to shirk hyperbole, Costas Kenteris this afternoon looked ahead to the hearing that will determine his Olympic future by proclaiming: \"After the crucifixion comes the resurrection.\" A latter-day Homer if ever we saw one. The Olympic 200m champion missed a dope test five days ago and left hospital only today after undergoing treatment for injuries sustained in a motorcycle crash. Kenteris, and his training partner Katerina Thanou, will learn tomorrow evening whether they are to be banished from these Games for missing the tests.</p> <p><strong>1.46pm</strong> Thank heavens for the repechage! Not only can we rejoice at the appearance of this marvellous word - which is never heard except for two weeks once every four years - but it has produced a British semi-finalist in the single sculls rowing. Ian Lawson is into the semis after a fine late charge to win his repechage - cherish it - in six minutes, 56.55 seconds. And on the commentary front, Sam Wingfield believes his licence fee is full value for money: \"In response to the commentary gaffes, I was in stitches last night during the men's synchronised diving, firstly by the Chinese diver falling on his back and secondly by the BBC commentary which amounted to 'Oh my God'.\" Let's hear it for Auntie</p> <p><strong>1.40pm</strong> A truly outstanding suggestion from Mr Niall Howarth, who kills a brace of flying mammals with just the single hard projectile by answering the cricketing and commentary questions at once. Hats off, sir. \"How much more entertaining would the opening ceremony have been with Stuart Hall providing commentary? I know it's an obvious one but I'd certainly pay money to see Robert Key in the pole vault.\" Seem to have stumped you all with the capital of Benin, though...</p> <p><strong>1.31pm</strong> For all you fans of Tim Henman out there, there are some words of (albeit scant) consolation to soothe your aching hearts. His first-round conqueror, Jiri \"The Invincible\" Novak, must abandon his own dreams of gold after being beaten in straight sets by Mikhail Youzhny, the Russian who is always cheered on in the stands by his doppelganger brother and his extremely intimidating-looking father, in the second round. And don't worry folks, because Tiger Tim will DEFINITELY win Wimbledon next year.</p> <p><strong>1.24pm</strong> Ahmed Almaktoum, the new Olympic champion in the double trap, is the first-ever medallist in the Games from the United Arab Emirates. So a warm, prolonged round of applause and lots of crowd sounds on the effects mike for him, please. </p> <p><strong>1.05pm</strong> The sports may change, but the Brits keep on losing. Ella Tripp and Joanne Wright were unable to whack the shuttlecock as high or as prodigiously as their Dutch opponents Lotte Bruil and Mia Audina of the Netherlands, and were beaten 15-7 15-7 in the second round doubles of the badminton. Badminton was what you were forced to play in PE when it was raining outside in Yorkshire during my schooldays. Meanwhile, Ahmed Almaktoum of the United Arab Emirates has claimed gold in the double trap, and Eurosport have kindly informed us that Gaborone is the capital of Botswana. So what's the capital of Benin? No cheating, I'll be able to tell...</p> <p><strong>1.03pm</strong> Good old Eurosport. During a fairly tepid early bout in the boxing, their commentary team opted for the old favourite to keep the viewers entertained: the mixed metaphor. \"After the early rounds, the wheat is sorted from the chaff, and you're left with the cream,\" said Eurosport's man ringside, Alan Partridge-style, in Athens. With this as your inspiration, send me any commentary gaffes that have particularly tickled you during the first few days of competition. Paul Dickinson beware...</p> <p><strong>12.58pm</strong> After Tim Henman on Sunday, Juan Carlos Ferraro becomes the latest contender to crash out of the Olympic men's tennis event. The blond bombshell from Spain, seeded five, was clearly not himself as he lost 4-6 7-6 6-4 to the wonderfully-named Mardy Fish, of the United States, in the second round.</p> <p><strong>12.52pm</strong> Meanwhile, England's spin wizard should take advantage of his unexpected royal status, reckons Ben Mimmack. \"As the King of Spain, Ashley Giles will surely be seen applauding in a half-hearted fashion as the Spanish team comes into the stadium during the closing ceremony.\" After his 18 wickets in two Tests, the loveable Gilo was transformed into a monarch when Wawrickshire received dozens of requests for mugs bearing the inscription \"Ashley Giles, King of Spain.\" What's the odd vowel between friends, eh?</p> <p> <strong>12.38pm</strong> Kenteris' training partner, Katerina Thanou, has left hospital 45 minutes afterwards. The pair had been missing for five days since failing to take dope tests. \"I feel very saddened and disappointed by all that has been said. I will wait for the IOC decision tomorrow and will continue to fight,\" said sprinter Thanou.</p> <p><strong>12.28pm</strong> Greek sprinter Costas Kenteris, at the centre of a doping case dogging the Olympics, left an Athens hospital on Tuesday to appear in public for the first time for five days. Kenteris had been there since he and training partner Katerina Thanou were involved in a motorcycle crash shortly after missing dope tests on Thursday. There was no indication of Thanou's whereabouts. </p> <p><strong>12.19pm</strong> Helen Reeves qualifies for semi-finals of women's kayak with a strong run that increases hopes of another British medal.</p> <p> <strong>12.10pm</strong> After a nasty virus that ruled her out of Wimbledon, Justine Henin-Hardenne is back. The top-seeded Belgian defeated Maria Vento-Kabchi 6-2, 6-1 in the second round of the tennis. Right, folks, here's this afternoon's teaser. With cricket not likely to be an Olympic sport until 2012 at least, what current sports in Athens do you think England's Test marvels would excel in? Email me your thoughts and no obvious answers, please: you all know who I mean...</p> <p><strong>12.05pm</strong> Blustery conditions still casting doubt over whether rowing repechages can get underway. Wind saw all races cancelled yesterday.</p>",
  "Denis MacShane is quite right to deride the lack of confidence of the British in their own solutions (A Harry Potter politics, August 12). Bevin, Attlee and other historic Labourites certainly achieved lasting, home-grown reforms. The trouble with New Labour is its inability to devise, argue for and push through grand reforms. Instead it gets distracted by the next \"big idea\" as it tries to keep up with what it perceives to be voters' concerns. The biggest distraction has been the re-invention of Iraq - a very modern twist on MacShane's concept of \"finding salvation everywhere except in their own country\". <p>He worries about past Labour governments failing to rein in rhetoric that alienates voters. Instead, New Labour is unwilling to argue for any of its policies in a coherent and mature fashion. It lacks knowledge and historical awareness, as well as wisdom, warmth, enthusiasm, an enquiring disposition and a sense of enjoyment. These are all aspects of MacShane's progressive theory and practice that need renewal. <br><b>Nico Macdonald</b><br> London </p> <p>Denis MacShane's argument caused little surprise, in contrast to his grasp of some aspects of contemporary history. He argued that the last three periods of Labour government did not \"legislate trade union recognition\". While this is true of the first two (but statutory union recognition was not an issue), it was untrue of the Wilson government (1974-6), whose Employment Protection Act 1975 introduced a statutory procedure for the recognition of trade unions. This had some success until gutted by the court of appeal. </p> <p>Both the 1975 act and the union-recognition procedures of the Conservative government's much-despised Industrial Relations Act 1971 did not protect employer-sponsored staff associations in the way that the current legislation does. The protests of the International Labour Organisation have been brushed aside. Union membership has indeed stabilised but the new union recognition procedures have not lowered the costs of unionisation. <br><b>Paul Smith</b><br> Department of Human Resource Management and Industrial Relations, Keele University</p>",
  "<p><strong>Don't miss:</strong> Women's individual all-round gymnastics (7pm). Always a great event and this year a battle between cold-war power blocs China, Russia, the US and Europe.

  "<p><strong>Don't miss:</strong> Track cycling. Jason Queally won gold four years ago in the 1km time trial, and the British are so strong in this event that he is unlikely to make the team this time. World champion Chris Hoy starts as favourite, and fellow Briton Craig MacLean could also win a medal. </p> <p><strong>Other highlights:</strong> Haile Gebrselassie goes for a third straight 10,000m gold (8.35pm) as the athletics timetable gets into full swing. Compatriot Kenenisa Bekele will start as favourite though after winning the world title last year. Several British hopes are in action, including Denise Lewis and Kelly Sotherton in the first day of the heptathlon, Kelly Holmes in the 800m (8pm) and Phillips Idowu in the triple jump (7.55am).</p> <p><strong>Full schedule</strong></p> <p><strong>Archery</strong></p> <p>0630 Women's Team 1/8 Eliminations </p> <p>0630 Women's Team Quarterfinals </p> <p>1345 Women's Team Semifinals </p> <p>1345 Women's Team Final </p> <p><strong>Badminton</strong></p> <p>0700 Men's Singles Semifinals </p> <p>0940 Men's Final Bronze Medal Match </p> <p>1200 Women's Doubles Semifinals </p> <p>1500 Men's Final Gold Medal Match </p> <p><strong>Baseball</strong></p> <p>0830 Preliminaries Taiwan v Italy </p> <p>0930 Preliminaries Japan v Canada </p> <p>1630 Preliminaries Australia v Greece </p> <p>1730 Preliminaries Cuba v Netherlands </p> <p><strong>Basketball</strong></p> <p>0700 Women's Preliminaries - Group A Russia v Japan </p> <p>0915 Women's Preliminaries - Group B New Zealand v China </p> <p>1230 Women's Preliminaries - Group B USA v Spain </p> <p>1445 Women's Preliminaries - Group B Czech Republic v Korea </p> <p>1800 Women's Preliminaries - Group A Australia v Greece </p> <p>2015 Women's Preliminaries - Group A Nigeria v Brazil </p> <p><strong>Beach volleyball</strong></p> <p>1230-2100 Men's and Women's Second Rounds</p> <p><strong>Boxing</strong></p> <p>1130 Featherweight Preliminaries</p> <p>1301 Lightweight Preliminaries </p> <p>1730 Bantamweight Preliminaries </p> <p>1901 Featherweight Preliminaries </p> <p><strong>Canoe/Kayak</strong></p> <p>0800 Men's Whitewater C-2 Semifinals </p> <p>0835 Men's Whitewater K-1 Semifinals </p> <p>0935 Men's Whitewater C-2 Final </p> <p>1000 Men's Whitewater K-1 Final </p> <p><strong>Cycling</strong> </p> <p>1430 Men's Individual Pursuit Qualifying </p> <p>1515 Women's 500m Time Trial Final </p> <p>1555 Men's Kilometer Time Trial Final </p> <p>1655 Men's Individual Pursuit Semifinals </p> <p><strong>Diving</strong></p> <p>1030 Women's 10m Platform Preliminary </p> <p><strong>Equestrian</strong></p> <p>0630 Individual Dressage Grand Prix </p> <p>0630 Team Dressage Grand Prix </p> <p><strong>Fencing</strong></p> <p>0800 Women's Team Epee Preliminaries </p> <p>0800 Women's Team Epee Quarterfinals </p> <p>0800 Women's Team Epee Semifinals </p> <p>1140 Women's Final Placement 5-6 </p> <p>1140 Women's Final Placement 7-8 </p> <p>1630 Women's Final Bronze Medal Match<br> 1740 Women's Final Gold Medal Match </p> <p><strong>Handball</strong></p> <p>0730 Men's Preliminaries - Pool A Korea v Iceland </p> <p>0930 Men's Preliminaries - Pool B Spain v Slovenia </p> <p>1230 Men's Preliminaries - Pool A Brazil v Greece </p> <p>1430 Men's Preliminaries - Pool B Hungary v Germany </p> <p>1730 Men's Preliminaries - Pool A Russia v Croatia </p> <p>1930 Men's Preliminaries - Pool B France v Egypt</p> <p><strong>Hockey</strong></p> <p>0630 Women's Preliminaries - Pool A </p> <p>0830 Women's Preliminaries - Pool B </p> <p>1600 Women's Preliminaries - Pool A </p> <p>1800 Women's Preliminaries - Pool B </p> <p><strong>Judo (finals)</strong></p> <p>0830 Women's Heavyweight Preliminaries/Repechages </p> <p>0830 Men's Heavyweight Preliminaries/Repechages </p> <p>1430 Women's Heavyweight Quarterfinals, semi-finals and final </p> <p>1430 Men's Heavyweight Quarterfinals, semi-finals and final</p> <p><strong>Sailing</strong></p> <p>1100 Women's Fleet Races Race 07, 08, 09, 10</p> <p><strong>Shooting</strong></p> <p>0700 Women's 50m Rifle 3 Position Qualification </p> <p>1000 Men's 50m Rifle Prone Position Qualification </p> <p>1030 Women's 50m Rifle 3 Position Final </p> <p>1230 Men's 50m Rifle Prone Position Final </p> <p><strong>Soccer</strong></p> <p>1600 Women's Quarterfinals </p> <p>1900 Women's Quarterfinals</p> <p><strong>Softball</strong> 0730 Preliminaries Italy v Canada </p> <p>1000 Preliminaries USA v Taiwan </p> <p>1500 Preliminaries Greece v Australia </p> <p>1730 Preliminaries Japan v China </p> <p><strong>Swimming</strong></p> <p>0800 Women's 50m Freestyle Heats </p> <p>0827 Men's 1500m Freestyle Heats </p> <p>1006 Women's 4x100m Medley Rel.

  "<p>It has, so far, been a largely disappointing day for the Brits. Particularly demoralising was the failure of defending champion Richard Faulds even to qualify for the final of the double trap shooting. Faulds was supremely self-confident yesterday, but a disastrous start to the third and final qualifying round, in which he missed nine of his 50 targets, left him in a distant 13th place, four shots off qualification. </p> <p>Slumped against a wall behind the mountain-top Markopoulo range, Faulds relayed his first words of disappointment to his family via mobile telephone. \"I'm bitterly disappointed and feeling pretty upset at the moment,\" he said later. \"I came out here trying to defend the gold medal and it hasn't happened for me. I put a lot of pressure on myself. I had a lot of nerves in the first round and couldn't settle. After that it was an uphill struggle.</p> <p>\"I was confident and training last week was going really well, but I didn't get going today, didn't get the flow I wanted. When that happens it's very difficult to fight back.\" </p> <p>Faulds was gracious enough to admit that eventual winner, Ahmed Almaktoum of the United Arab Emirates, was a worthy successor to his crown. Almaktoum, a 40-year-old, bandana-wearing former national squash champion, equalled the Olympic record, and proceeded to endear himself to the crowd by blowing them kisses to celebrate his clear victory. </p> <p>British <strong>three-day eventing</strong> medal hope Pippa Funnell also saw her dreams of Olympic gold shattered today. Funnell, who completed an unprecedented 'Grand Slam' of major three-day event victories last year, went into the second discipline in the silver medal position following the dressage, but on a short cross-country course she slipped out of contention. The 35-year-old blamed her defeat on putting the safety of her horse before personal glory. A combination of a shortened course and a long, downhill finish proved too much for her big-striding gelding Primmore's Pride to deal with. Instead of pushing him beyond what she considered safe, she chose to nurse him round, finishing almost half a minute off the pace and dropping her down to eighth in the individual standings. \"He is a big, long-striding horse,' she said, \"and it is hard for him to stay balanced. I couldn't just let him keep running: he is far too precious for that.\" </p> <p>There was some good news, however, as William Fox-Pitt climbed one place to fifth - at Funnell's expense - with a clear round. Fox-Pitt is now just three points behind Germany's Bettina Hoy, who occupies the silver medal position.</p> <p>In the team competition, Britain are now third, and must hold off the challenge of the United States, who are only four points adrift, in the show-jumping phase tomorrow to clinch the bronze. </p> <p>In <strong>rowing</strong>, Ian Lawson produced a magnificent late charge to win his repechage and qualify for the semi-finals of the men's single sculls. The 26-year-old made a desperately slow start and trailed the early leader, Aly Ibrahim of Algeria, by over six seconds at the first timecheck after 500 metres. However, he drove through the field with long, smooth strokes to claw back the leaders.</p> <p>There was no such satisfaction for the British men's lightweight coxless fours, who trailed in last in their repechage and were eliminated from the competition. Mike Hennessy, Tim Male, Nick English and Mark Hunter were nicely in touch with the leading Russians after 500m but endured a nightmare second quarter to slip back to last place at the halfway stage. </p> <p>The men's quad sculls, featuring Simon Cottle, Alan Campbell, Peter Gardner and Peter Wells, appeared on course for similar disappointment when they reached the 1500m mark in last place. However, a late charge took them past the French into a third place finish - enough to see them qualify for the semi-finals along with the United States and Switzerland. </p> <p>Tracy Langlands and Helen Casey also moved into Thursday's semi-finals of the lightweight women's double sculls with a steady second-place finish in the repechage. The pair had failed to make it through earlier in the week, finishing fourth in a heat won in world record time of 6:49.90 by the Australian pair Sally Newmarch and Amber Halliday. </p> <p>\"It was a massive improvement on Sunday, confirmed Casey, \"which, from our point of view, was a complete disaster. We have done well. We have worked a lot on getting our brains sorted after that. We went out in the hideous water yesterday and just worked and worked on what we needed to do today.\" </p> <p>The British <strong>men's hockey</strong> team were beaten 3-2 in Pool A by Sydney silver medallists South Korea, currently ranked fourth in the world. Britain led the game twice through Danny Hall and Niall Stott, but couldn't hold on to the advantage and succumbed to a penalty corner winner from Jung Seon Lee two minutes from time. Britain even had chance to nick a point after the hooter, but Ben Hawes dragged his penalty corner wide. </p> <p>Coach Jason Lee felt his side deserved more reward from a performance which almost went exactly to plan. Britain had gone into the game top of Pool A after an opening victory over Egypt. \"We were playing Korea to get a result, which included a draw, especially because of how it had gone in the first game. We set it up to make sure we were tight and we created some chances in the second half, we just didn't take them. But we have got three more games and we are not far off where we hoped to be at this point.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Pool B, prolific Australian Jamie Dwyer took his tally to five goals in two matches with a double in his country's 2-2 draw against Argentina.</p> <p>In <strong>badminton</strong>, Britain's Richard Vaughan crashed out of the men's singles at the last 16 stage, failing to exceed his disappointing performance in Sydney four years ago. The Welsh hope, a bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games in Manchester, was never ahead in the first set against seventh-seeded Korean Seung Mo Shon, and his touch at the net frequently let him down. The Korean wrapped up the decisive set 15-4 in just nine minutes, leaving Vaughan dejected. </p> <p>Ella Tripp and Joanne Wright also saw their Games ended at the Goudi Olympic Hall. The duo suffered a straight-sets defeat by fifth-seeded Dutch pair Mia Audina and Lotte Bruil in 40 minutes. They lost the first set 15-7 and were 11-0 down in the second when they began a fightback, only to lose the set by the same margin as the first. </p> <p>On the positive side, Stuart McIntosh qualified in fifth place for the final of the <strong>men's C1 canoeing</strong> competition. \"I'm in good shape,\" he declared afterwards. </p> <p>Similarly heartening was the performance of <strong>archers</strong> Alison Williamson and Naomi Folkard, who booked their places in tomorrow's quarter-finals. Williamson, a primary school teacher from Church Stretton, Shropshire, gave Japan's Sayoko Kawauchi a lesson during their last 16 clash this morning. Williamson, ranked 21st in the world, chalked up 154 points to 53rd-ranked Kawauchi's 150.</p> <p>Meanwhile, 17th-ranked Folkard, a music student from Leamington Spa, beat Finland's 49th-ranked Mari Piuva by 156 points to 151.</p> <p>There was fewer reasons to smile for Britain in <strong>fencing</strong> today, though. Louise Bond-Williams suffered a 15-12 defeat in her last-16 clash with Elena Netchaeva, having earlier set up the meeting with the Russian by inflicting a 15-13 defeat on Susanne Koenig of Germany. </p> <p>In Tennis, ninth seed Marat Safin was beaten 7-6 (7/4) 6-3 by Spain's Feliciano Lopez in the second round. In the women's event, world number one Justine Henin-Hardenne, who was forced to sit out almost three months of action because of a virus, moved into the third round with a 6-2 6-1 win over Maria Vento-Kabchi of Venezuela.</p>",
  "Eight men arrested during anti-terrorism raids two weeks ago have been charged with conspiring to commit murder, Scotland Yard said today. <p>The men, among 13 arrested in a series of raids across England on August 3, were today charged at the high security Paddington Green police station in London, where they had been held since their arrests. </p> <p>They are charged with conspiring to murder \"other persons\" between January 2000 and August 4 this year. </p> <p>The eight were also charged with conspiring to use \"radioactive materials, toxic gases, chemicals and explosives\" between the same dates. Both charges were made under the Criminal Law Act 1977. </p> <p>One of the men, Dhiren Barot, of Willesden, north-west London, was also charged with having plans which could have been used as the basis for a terrorist attack on the New York stock exchange, the IMF in Washington and Citigroup in New York.</p> <p>In addition, Mr Barot and Nadeem Tarmohammed, also of Willesden, had been in possession of a plan of the Prudential building in New Jersey which could have been used to prepare a terrorist attack, the charge sheet said.</p> <p>Both Mr Barot and Quaisar Shaffi, also of Willesden, were charged with possessing notes related to the use of explosions and poisons. </p> <p>All eight will appear in custody at Bow Street magistrates' court, sitting at Belmarsh tomorrow.</p> <p>The men are Mr Barot, 32; Omar Abdul Rehman, 20, of Bushey, Hertfordshire; Zia Ul Haq, 25, of Paddington, London; Abdul Aziz Jalil, 31, of Luton, Bedfordshire; Mr Tarmohammed, 26; Mohammed Naveed Bhatti, 24, of Harrow, Middlesex; Mr Shaffi, 25, and Junade Feroze, of Blackburn, Lancashire. </p> <p>A ninth man, Matthew Philip Monks, 32, of Sudbury, London, who was questioned with the eight at Paddington Green was charged with possessing a banned weapon. </p> <p>Scotland Yard has denied that the August 3 raids - which involved armed officers from MI5 and four English police forces - had been the result of intelligence provided by Pakistan, including information about potential US targets which led to a terrorist alert there earlier this month.</p> <p>Four men arrested during the operation were later released.

  "A Guardian/ICM opinion poll showing that people are in favour of new measures to enable more family-friendly working has prompted calls for the government to introduce further legislation. <p>Labour MP Martin O'Neill, the chairman of the House of Commons trade and industry select committee, urged ministers to act on people's \"rising expectations\", while striking a balance with the ability of small businesses to provide flexible working hours.</p> <p>The Guardian/ICM poll found that 66% of people would like to see families being given a choice of deciding whether fathers or mothers should be able to take or share the six months' paid leave currently available only as maternity leave.</p> <p>Fifty three per cent wanted to see fathers given more than the current two weeks' paid maternity leave, and 51% want to see mothers given more than six months' paid maternity leave.</p> <p>Speaking to Guardian Unlimited, Mr O'Neill praised the government's efforts to encourage greater work-life balance - it recently gave employees the right to request flexible working hours, better-paid maternity leave and two weeks' paid leave for fathers - and called on it to act again.</p> <p>\"People with young children want to spend more time with them and most reasonable employers would recognise that this would help improve employer relations,\" he said. </p> <p>\"However a sizeable minority of small and medium-sized enterprises often have difficulty in accommodating such arrangements. The challenge for government is to strike the balance between these rising expectations and limited abilities.\"</p> <p>Mr O'Neill also confirmed that the Commons trade and industry select committee is currently looking at ways to improve family-friendly working legislation as part of its inquiry into flexible labour markets in the UK.</p> <p>His view that the government needs to go further in encouraging work-life balance is shared by the Liberal Democrats' trade and industry spokesman, Malcolm Bruce, and Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the TUC.</p> <p>Mr Bruce urged ministers to \"recognise that people who have children are making an economic contribution to the country\" and look at why so few parents are currently taking up their parental-leave entitlement.</p> <p>He also called on the government to abandon its plans to introduce the \u00a3800m \"baby bond\" scheme and redirect the money to measures that help support parents during their children's early years.</p> <p>Mr Barber, meanwhile, demanded that the government abandon its opt-out of the European Union's working time directive [WTD], which limits the number of hours employers can call on people to work.</p> <p>He said that the findings of the Guardian/ICM poll \"show the backlash against UK's long-hours culture, particularly amongst younger workers... [and] suggests people want a limit on the hours employees work in the UK, something that is currently being frustrated by the government's insistence that our opt-out to the WTD must remain\". </p> <p>Mr O'Neill echoed Mr Barber's comments on the WTD opt-out, saying it is \"understandable that people do not want themselves as British citizens to be denied these rights.\"</p>",

  "<p>Last Friday I lit a candle for my beloved daughter Karen. I returned to Bournemouth, where I had spent my last holiday with her, and sat on the bench placed in her memory, overlooking the sea. It was 1995 and Karen was only 30 when tragedy struck. </p> <p>Karen was loving, caring and vivacious with a delightful sense of humour. She was a wonderful daughter and adored her three brothers. She worked with two of them - performing in a magic act with Paul, and in the family business with Mark. Life was good until 1985, so what happened to bring such devastation to our family? </p> <p>In April of that year, the drug suphasalazine was prescribed to Karen, after a diagnosis (later considered questionable) of Crohn's Disease of the bowel. The first sign of a psychological adverse drug reaction (ADR) was soon afterwards, when Karen experienced terrifying hallucinatory nightmares. The consultant insisted that she should continue taking the drug. I later found that his advice was given in ignorance - he had not even seen the drug data sheet. </p> <p>The family departed for a cruise in August and it was during this time that Karen's personality began to change. She became like a tightly coiled spring, ready to snap, and then went missing from the ship during a stopover. When she was eventually found she had become psychotic and lost her sense of reality. Flown by air ambulance to hospital in London, the consultant just glanced at her, then turned and walked briskly away. We were shocked to hear him say, \"Nothing to do with me,\" as he left. </p> <p>Karen was transferred to a psychiatric hospital and suffered further adverse reactions to the drug Haloperidol, which had been administered to treat the psychosis. I remember her ringing me from hospital in tears, to tell me that there were maggots crawling over her face and into her ears. By the time I got there, she was unconscious - knocked out with another drug. When she came round, her neck was distended, her tongue was sticking to the roof of her mouth and she was gagging - all ADRs to the treatment. </p> <p>A recent study in the British Medical Journal found that one in 16 of all admissions to hospital is caused by side effects. The author, Munir Pirmohamed, professor of clinical pharmacology at Liverpool University, said his figures suggested that side effects cause the deaths of about 5,700 patients each year. It did not even include psychiatric ADRs. </p> <p>Time heals and Karen picked up her life again. She came off all medication and found a job as a PA, where she was highly regarded by her employers. Meanwhile, we were all assured by the psychiatrist that this had been a crisis that would not happen again. </p> <p>But the dark clouds did descend again, six years later. An adverse reaction to Dianette, a drug prescribed for hormonal problems and acne, led to another mood change. An antidepressant, Fluanxol was prescribed. Its immediate effect was akathisia, or as Karen described it, \"a panic attack\". </p> <p>We might have found our way out of the woods by 1992 were it not for a dental surgeon who recommended the removal of Karen's impacted wisdom teeth. Just seven days afterwards, in the words of the surgeon, \"This poor girl slipped into paranoia, probably due to the surgery.\" </p> <p>Unknown to me, a few days before the surgery, Karen had taken a morning-after pill because her boyfriend's condom had split. The risk of psychiatric adverse effects of this drug is on the data sheet, but when Karen phoned the surgeon's secretary, she told her there was no need to mention it to the surgeon. Whether this was a factor I do not know, but I am convinced it could hardly have helped. </p> <p>After recovering from this episode, Karen was told to take at regular intervals, an anti-psychotic drug, Largactyl (or chlorpromazine). To counteract the side effects, which made her muscles go rigid, she was prescribed an anti-Parkinson drug, Kemadrin, as well as Temazepam, a sleeping pill. Altogether, a potent cocktail for someone weighing only seven stone. </p> <p>What is difficult to convey is that Karen's psychological \"breakdowns\" were so devastating for all concerned that it was a relief to find a drug to \"stabilise\" her. We did not know then that these drugs would also cause problems. </p> <p>Energy was spent trying to keep some normality in our lives. We were in a kind of spiral of ignorance and denial, trying to pick up our lives and hoping all would soon be okay. It was difficult to talk to people about the nightmares we were going through. Karen just wanted to be normal and, as soon as she felt fine, wanted to take control of her life and not look back at the nightmares of the past. But my daughter was on a downhill slide. </p> <p>Karen started suffering dizziness and low blood pressure. Her skin, eyesight and sparkling alertness were affected and her libido diminished She told me she felt she had lost a sense of her own personality. </p> <p>What had become of the feisty girl who travelled alone to a village in Japan to be with her brother Paul for his 21st birthday? The girl who pretended to be a reporter to have her photograph taken with her idol, John Travolta, at a movie premiere? The glamorous performer delighting audiences in her brother's magic act? </p> <p>On August 13 1995, we were on holiday in Bournemouth and my husband Jeff had returned home. I spent a peaceful day on the beach with Karen and a relaxing evening listening to music. The next morning, I awoke to find her by my bed concerned at the commotion outside the apartment block. </p> <p>A huge crane was being raised from the back of a large vehicle, and the warning sound of the lorry reversing into the area at the side of the flats beside Karen's bedroom still sounds in my ears. </p> <p>She felt uneasy and asked if we could go home. I suggested she get dressed and went to make a telephone call. Moments later, I went into Karen's room to find a kitchen chair by the window, which was swivelled to its widest point with the curtain flapping against the frame. The horror of my realisation was something that no mother should ever have to experience. </p> <p>On the vinyl seat was a silky quilt, the cause of her slipping, according to the inquest. </p> <p>After Karen died, I found a book in her room called \"Tranquillisers - a comprehensive guide to the range of medicines in the UK that affect some aspect of the working of the brain\". She had obtained it from her college library, where she was studying beauty therapy. The college kindly let me keep the book. In it she had underlined certain side effects listed for the drugs she was taking. </p> <p>One was a high dose of procyclidine (or Kemadrin), said to cause anxiety, confusion, agitation and psychological disturbance. To my horror, I found that not only had Karen been misprescribed (on repeat prescriptions) three times the dose her psychiatrist had intended, but the manufacturer's data sheet recommended stopping the drug after three months. Karen was on this dose for two years. </p> <p>In shock, I went to the British Library and found several papers and journals with references to the psychiatric adverse effects of all Karen's drugs. I felt I had opened a can of worms and that it was my destiny to do something about that wall of silence. </p> <p>In 1998, I founded the charity April (Adverse Psychiatric Reactions Information Link), which was also the month of Karen's birthday. I hoped that, by increasing awareness, perhaps the terrible waste of her life could save someone else's. </p> <p>I now receive a constant flow of emails reporting the same kind of experiences as Karen's. People tell me how helpful they find it that someone understands. One woman who was very depressed, showed her doctor medical information that I had sent her. Only then did he agree to change the medication for her heart problems.\"I feel 600% better,\" she told me. </p> <p>I send out withdrawal protocols to help doctors support their patients during withdrawal from SSRI antidepressants and benzodiazepines, as well as presenting workshops for health professionals to persuade them to report ADRs on Yellow Cards, the side-effect reporting system which, 40 years after its conception, is still not effective. I also contribute evidence to department of health and government inquiries and organise conferences. The next one, Adverse Psychiatric Reactions to Medicines and Anaesthetics, is on November 4. </p> <p>April is now the main focus of my life and I campaign on all sorts of issues, from demanding that coroners record all drugs prescribed, stopped or doses changed, in the months prior to sudden death, to making sure that medical students understand about ADRs. I can never bring my lovely daughter back but it is a comfort to be able to help others. I believe awareness saves lives and have taken on the task of bringing that awareness to the medical profession and the public. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.april.org.uk\">www.april.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Among all complementary approaches to healthcare, herbal medicine is probably the most popular. About one third of us try remedies such as echinacea for a cold, garlic for elevated cholesterol, valerian for disturbed sleep and St John's Wort for low mood. Even sceptics have surely enjoyed a cup of tea to revive their spirits, and strictly speaking, that too is herbal medicine. Yet most consumers have only a vague idea about what herbal medicine is. Many confuse it with homoeopathy, non-herbal food supplements or vitamins. </p> <p>Herbal medicinal products are dauntingly defined by EU officials as \"any medicinal product containing as active ingredients one or more herbal substance or one or more herbal preparations, or one or more such herbal substances in combination with one or more such herbal preparations\". Essentially this means that herbal medicines have to be whole plant extracts rather than preparations of single chemicals contained in a plant. Aspirin, for instance, a chemical derived from willow bark, is obviously not a herbal medicine. </p> <p>In many ways, a herbal extract is like a good wine, as these medicines differ according to climate, soil, time of harvest, handling of the crop, method of extraction and storage conditions. A good chateau differs from year to year; similarly herbal extracts can vary from batch to batch. Consequently, a degree of variability in quality is unavoidable. </p> <p>Unlike conventional medicines, herbal remedies are not usually licensed as drugs. This lack of control means that some of the products are better than others. One brand of paracetamol is much like the next, but one brand of garlic remedy can be substantially different from another. My advice is to buy from a reputable source. New European regulation will soon provide for better consumer protection, but currently there are few guarantees. </p> <p>Many British doctors insist that herbal medicine is useless. But they often lack sufficient knowledge in this area. The evidence shows that some remedies work very well and have powerful effects on our health: hawthorn improves the symptoms of heart failure; kava decreases anxiety; garlic lowers cholesterol levels; Ginkgo Biloba slows the decline of mental functions in Alzheimer's disease; and St John's Wort alleviates depression. </p> <p>However, the pessimistic view of the sceptics is sharply contrasted by the frequently over-optimistic view of herbal medicine promoters who insist that their remedies are natural and hence safe. Some, perhaps even most, are reasonably safe but other herbal medicines can seriously endanger our health: Some herbs are toxic and can damage organs such as the liver or kidney. Some preparations, particularly those from Asia, are contaminated with poisonous substances such as heavy metals. Occasionally, herbal mixtures have been adulterated with drugs like corticosteroids or other powerful prescription medicines. In rare cases, one harmless herb in a mixture has been replaced by a similar-looking but poisonous plant. In all of these events, consumers can suffer serious harm. </p> <p>If a herbal remedy works, shouldn't we simply isolate its pharmacologically active ingredient and produce it synthetically? Then all the uncertainty about the quality and strength of the extracts could disappear. Unfortunately, this seemingly simple strategy has been successful only in isolated cases: many years ago, chemists managed to produce digoxin (a powerful heart medication) from the foxglove, Aspirin from the willow and morphine from the poppy. More recently they identified potent anti-cancer drugs from the needles of the yew tree and from the common periwinkle. But more often than not, isolating active ingredients from herbal extracts does not work. Herbal medicines contain not one but a myriad of active compounds. Isolate one and you only have a fraction of the total effect. </p> <p>This level of complexity can make research into herbal medicine difficult. Add lack of funding to the equation and you see why so many questions in herbal medicine remain unanswered. There are few big players to support expensive clinical trials. And plants cannot be patented, so the impetus for commercial investment is close to zero. </p> <p>The way forward is neither over-enthusiastic promotion nor negative scepticism. What we need is well-informed realism - a depressingly rare quality in the realm of herbal medicine.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Edzard Ernst is professor of complementary medicine at the Peninsula Medical School at the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth.</p>",
  "<p>British Airways improved a pay offer for ground staff today in an effort to avert a planned 24-hour strike that threatens a repeat of last summer's chaotic scenes at Heathrow airport.</p> <p>On top of an existing pay offer of an 8.5% rise over three years, BA said it would offer staff a series of bonuses for good attendance. Those absent for 16 days or less between now and September 2006 could bonus payments of up to a total of \u00a31,000.</p> <p>Unions, however, said it did not mean the threat of a strike later had been averted as they prepared for further meetings to consider the offer. </p> <p>The airline said its offer met the union demands. </p> <p>\"The unions have been asking us for 14.5% over three years. This offer meets that claim,\" said Mike Street, BA's director of operations. </p> <p>Ed Blissett, the national officer of the GMB union, said it was too early to respond to the offer and that talks would continue this afternoon. BA is negotiating with three unions representing more than 10,000 check-in staff, baggage handlers and other employees to try to negotiate a solution to a long-running pay dispute. </p> <p>Members of the GMB union are threatening to strike for 24 hours on August 27, 28, 29 or 30, a long holiday weekend, unless the airline raises its offer of an 8.5% over three years. The outcome of a vote by more than 8,000 members of the larger Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) will be known later this week. The unions are expected to coordinate any strike action. </p> <p>Last summer, BA was hit by a wildcat strike over the introduction of swipe cards. That stoppage cost the airline \u00a340m, forced it to scrap 500 flights and disrupted travel for more than 100,000 people.</p> <p>A 24-hour walkout by check-in staff could cost BA \u00a310m and the company would also have to count the cost of fewer future bookings if it failed to avert strike action, analysts said. </p> <p>Barclays Stockbrokers said the latest threat of industrial action had come at the worst time for the airline, which is already wrestling with higher pension costs, increased landing charges and record oil prices. Last week BA doubled its fuel surcharge on long-haul flights. Mike Powell, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, estimated that BA would lose \u00a310m for each strike day on the basis that it would have to shut down 60% of its network. But if its contingency plans failed to keep more than 20% of its network in operation, then the cost could rise to \u00a315m, he said. </p> <p>Mr Powell added that agreeing to union demands would leave a considerable dent in the BA's profits. </p> <p>\"The difference between BA's position and the union's position is about \u00a320m in additional staff costs,\" he said. </p> <p>Barclays said more passengers were expected to fly with BA this year because of price-cutting, which is expected to lead to a 2-3% increase in revenues. But profits will depend on the success of a drive to eliminate \u00a3300m of staffing costs and future oil prices. </p> <p>\"We suspect that the outcome may be some compromise to avert a strike but this may mean higher-than-expected labour costs, so the forecasts will come under pressure,\" Barclays said. </p> <p>BA last week posted profits of \u00a3115m in the three months to June 30 - up from its Iraq war-related losses of \u00a345m in 2003.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's third largest private hospitals operator, Nuffield Hospitals Group, is receiving \u00a318.5m a year in tax breaks because of its charitable status, it has emerged.</p> <p>The figures were revealed in evidence submitted by Nuffield's chief executive, David Mobbs, to the joint parliamentary committee scrutinising new charities legislation.</p> <p>Nuffield, which operates like a private company, offering services to those who can pay or have private health insurance, admits the tax breaks make up a \"significant\" 4.5% of its \u00a3410m annual income.</p> <p>The group runs 44 hospitals with a total of more than 1,700 beds. Last year, Nuffield saw a \u00a321.5m operating surplus. It recently won a commercial contract to provide 17,000 orthopaedic operations for the NHS.</p> <p>But the group's charitable status is under threat from the draft charities bill, now being scrutinised by the joint committee, which ministers have promised will force charities that charge high fees to prove they offer a \"public benefit\".</p> <p>The charities minister, Fiona Mactaggart, has pledged that the public benefit test will apply to private schools and hospitals with charitable status, and has warned that independent hospitals with charitable status, such as Nuffield hospitals are \"the bit the biggest question is about\".</p> <p>Mr Mobbs' written evidence to the parliamentary committee follows the shredding meted out to the group's finance director, Jack Jones, by the MPs and peers in June. </p> <p>Labour MP George Foulkes told Mr Jones that the public would be \"astonished\" to know Nuffield was a charity, asking: \"Do you not think it strange that a multimillion pound private health organisation has charitable status?\" </p> <p>But in his written statement, Mr Mobbs argued that Nuffield \"does not particularly seek charitable status\". Instead \"the law insists that certain organisations are treated as charities\".</p> <p>Nuffield is a healthcare provider whose constitution states that it cannot distribute surpluses as private profit and charity law requires all its property and surpluses to be used only for stated purposes, the statement said. </p> <p>\"As the law stands, parliament insists that our property be protected by registration as a charity. </p> <p>\"This is the common denominator of Nuffield and Oxfam, and all other charities. The money we collect through the charges we make is the same for this purpose as Oxfam money in a collecting tin.\"</p> <p>But Mr Mobbs' paper added that Nuffield would \"obviously not choose to lose\" the tax breaks it gets from charitable status.</p> <p>The statement also suggested that Nuffield might challenge any test of public benefit that affected it in an \"adverse or inconsistent\" way in comparison with other charities that charge for services, such as the social care charities that provide services under contract to local authorities.</p>",
  "A delegation of leading Iraqis flew to the embattled holy city of Najaf today to convey a peace proposal to Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, whose militia has been battling US and Iraqi troops for control of the city. <p>The delegation from the Iraqi national conference in Baghdad flew out on US military helicopters, after earlier delaying the mission over security concerns. </p> <p>The peace proposal demanded that Mr Sadr's Mahdi army put down their arms and join Iraq's political process in exchange for amnesty. </p> <p>\"This delegation is not negotiating, it is conveying the proposal,\" said delegation head Hussein al-Sadr, a distant relative of the cleric. \"I hope this delegation will be able to solve one of the big problems that hit our country.\" </p> <p>The mission comes on another bloody day for Baghdad: insurgents fired a shell at a crowded street in centre of the city today, killing at least seven people, including two children. </p> <p>The blast destroyed seven cars and left pools of blood on the sidewalks of Rasheed Street in the heart of the Iraqi capital. At least 42 people were wounded in the attack. </p> <p>\"The place was very crowded, it is a commercial area ... casualties are being taken to hospital now,\" an interior ministry official said.</p> <p>The Iraqi national conference meeting in the city's fortified \"green zone\" was due to elect a 100-member national assembly today.

  "New Jersey Governor James \"I'm a Gay American\" McGreevey has a pretty mouth. Has any politician ever looked better wrapping his lips around his own resignation? That was my first thought while watching the big gay press conference last week that served as the 47-year-old governor's coming out and resignation - followed closely by, \"Wait, what the hell is up with his wife?\" If I called a press conference to announce that I was a straight American, that I had conducted an affair with a woman that was going to destroy my career (much of which is based on my cocksucking cred), the only way my boyfriend would stand at my side beaming would be if he was holding my recently amputated testicles behind his clenched teeth. <p>The reaction of the wronged wife is almost always the most interesting aspect of a juicy political sex scandal; the public seems to look to her before deciding how it should react. Remember when William Jefferson Clinton was impeached for ... well, take your pick: for having an adulterous affair, for lying under oath about having an adulterous affair, for having the nerve to win two elections. When Hillary made it clear she was going to stick with Bill, the American public did the same. Of course, it helped that rumours about Clinton's zipper problems had trailed him throughout his political career - Americans knew he was a horndog when we elected him. Finding out he got it on with an intern didn't tell us anything we didn't already know or suspect. When the Lewinsky scandal broke, there was a lot of speculation about What Hillary Knew and When She Knew It. Many wondered if Bill and Hillary's marriage wasn't a loveless, sexless sham, a marriage of political convenience, a marriage about power, not love. Many concluded that Bill and Hillary must have had an \"understanding\" about outside sexual contact. For some, Hillary's decision to stay with Bill confirmed their suspicions about the existence of an understanding: Hillary wasn't angry, the \"understanding\" theorists concluded, because Bill wasn't doing anything she hadn't given him the green light to do. (Except, of course, for getting caught.) </p> <p>Watching Mrs McGreevey beam at her pretty-mouthed gay American husband, I found myself wondering aloud to my pretty-mouthed gay American boyfriend (I have a thing for pretty mouths, what can I say?) whether, like the Clintons before them, Mr and Mrs McGreevey might have had an understanding. Just as Hillary had to know Bill could be true to her only in his fashion, so it seems pretty clear that Mrs McGreevey had to know her husband was a homo all along. The first Mrs McGreevey apparently knew: when asked by the New York Times whether she was aware of her former husband's sexuality, the woman who divorced McGreevey pointedly refused to answer the question. In the Seattle Times, McGreevey's former mother-in-law flat-out said that she knew. And then there were all those rumours about McGreevey that have been circulating in New Jersey for years. To my mind, only having already known could explain Mrs McGreevey's composure, her compassionate, affectionate smile during the press conference. She didn't look like a woman who had been shocked to discover that her husband was getting it on with the hired (male) help. </p> <p>If she did know that her husband was gay and didn't care, Mrs McGreevey isn't alone. It's impossible to know how many straight women are happily married to men that they know are gay - the census hasn't gotten around to that question yet - but they're out there. I know two married straight woman/gay man couples: in both cases, the men and women were friends who decided to marry after concluding that romantic love simply wasn't in the cards for them. Their marriages are loving compromises that have allowed all involved to settle down and start families. Defeat and resignation turned into something lasting and good. Is that the case with the McGreeveys? Until we find out - until Mrs McGreevey's inevitable book is published - it seems plausible that she knew about her husband's sexual non-conformity and didn't care. </p> <p>Of course, for a high-profile couple like the McGreeveys, their marriage could be about something more than affection and resignation. Some people marry for status and power - another charge laid at the feet of Bill and Hillary by angry conservatives. Oddly enough, the obtaining and hoarding of status and power are the true hallmarks of \"traditional marriage\". If Mrs McGreevey married for those reasons, she's in good company. But she's unlikely to remain married for long, once her husband is no longer governor. </p> <p>But let's suppose that Mrs McGreevey didn't know. What if she looked so composed during the press conference because she downed a handful of Xanax a moment or two before it began? What if she, like most straight women who discover their husbands are gay, is devastated by the news? (Self-help titles available on Amazon include The Other Side of the Closet: The Coming-Out Crisis for Straight Spouses and Families and My Husband Is Gay: A Woman's Survival Guide.) If that's the case, I hope the religious right has the decency to send Mrs McGreevey - and every other woman out there who discovers she's married to a closeted gay man - an apology. For isn't duping poor straight women into marrying us the religious right's advice to gay men? </p> <p>According to the Falwells, Robertsons and Santorums of the world, I'm supposed to think less about the South African Olympic men's swim team and more about hell (hot!) and eternity (long!). Then I'm supposed to go find a woman I can trick into marrying me. So what if the foundation of my marriage is a lie? So what if I have to struggle against my sexual and emotional needs all my adult life? Do what you gotta do, faggot: if you need to think about other men - like, say, all those nice boys on the South African Olympic swim team - in order to perform sexually for your wife and make some babies, Senator Santorum says go for it. And if the truth about my sexuality were to ever come out - if I were, say, threatened with a $50m lawsuit by my same-sex piece on the side - the poor woman I've lied to will feel humiliated and violated but, shit, no one ever said that marriage was all sweetness and light, right? </p> <p>If it does nothing else, the McGreevey marriage highlights the chief absurdity of the arguments of those opposed to gay marriage: gay men can, in point of fact, get married - provided we marry women, duped or otherwise. The porousness of the sacred institution is remarkable: gay people are a threat to marriage, but gay people are encouraged to marry - indeed, we have married, under duress, for centuries, and the religious right would like us to continue to do so today - as long as our marriages are a sham. As long as we're willing to lie to ourselves, our wives, our communities, our children, and, for someone like McGreevey, our constituents. A closeted gay man like McGreevey can even marry twice and have both his marriages regarded as legitimate. Even as an openly gay man, McGreevey can remain married to his wife and smoke all the pole he likes on the side. There ain't no law agin' it, Senator Santorum. But how does this state of affairs protect marriage from the homos, I wonder? If an openly gay man can get married as long as his marriage makes a mockery of what is the defining characteristic of modern marriage - romantic love - or if he marries simply because he despairs of finding a same-sex partner, what harm could possibly be done by opening marriage to the gay men who don't want to make a mockery of marriage or who can find a same-sex partner? </p> <p>Gay Americans - the out variety - no doubt expect the newly out McGreevey to follow the standard high-profile/celebrity coming out story arc: write a book, get a boy/girlfriend, go on Oprah, make ass of self (see Greg Louganis, Ellen DeGeneres, Rosie O'Donnell, et al). Not me. I'm hoping for a different outcome this time. In my perverse heart of hearts, I hope Mr and Mrs McGreevey remain married. It might help Americans realise that people marry for lots of different reasons and that romantic love need not be the only reason - or even a reason - that two people decide to spend their lives together. And if the idea of a gay man married to a woman makes America uncomfortable, well, perhaps they should let us marry each other. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Dan Savage is the author of the widely syndicated sex advice column Savage Love, as well as the editor of The Stranger, Seattle's largest weekly newspaper.

  "<p>More than 1,000 magazine titles could disappear from newsagent and supermarket shelves if the government implements proposed changes to competition law next year, a new report has warned.</p> <p>The Periodical Publishers Association, which represents magazine publishers, is claiming many of its members could be forced out of business by the planned changes.</p> <p>A PPA-commissioned report, which has been seen by MediaGuardian.co.uk, will be sent to the Office of Fair Trading within the next few weeks and warns that the moves would deter publishers from launching new magazines and result in a number of closures.</p> <p>\"Substantially different alternative arrangements [to those at present] would result in a considerably worse industry environment than currently exists,\" claims the report, written by Loughborough University's Professor Paul Dobson.</p> <p>Under the current system, magazines and newspapers are distributed on a regional basis through exclusive contracts with major names including WH Smith and John Menzies.</p> <p>But smaller wholesalers have long complained that the system freezes them out and is anticompetitive.</p> <p>Now the Department of Trade and Industry plans to abolish the law that allows distributors to enjoy exclusive rights over certain territories from next May.</p> <p>But the PPA says opening up the distribution market would lead to increased supply costs that would force some retailers to shut, hitting sales and circulation levels.</p> <p>It claims that while many readers would simply use alternative outlets, others would simply stop buying magazines and newspapers - causing up to \u00a350m to be wiped off the total magazine market.</p> <p>Newspapers, it claims, would also be affected with up to \u00a3100m a year wiped off sales.</p> <p>\"By our estimates 20,000 retailers are put at risk and so are at least 1,000 magazine titles. This cannot be allowed to happen. Maintaining the wonderful diversity of the printed media that we have in the UK has to be a cause worth fighting for,\" said PPA chief executive Ian Locks.</p> <p>According to the PPA, there are 8,337 magazine titles currently in circulation. </p> <p>A little over 5,000 of those are business-to-business publications, while 3,229 are consumer titles.</p> <p>The latter are more likely to be at risk since, although many B2B titles do end up on newsstands, the vast majority are supplied to businesses direct.</p> <p>The publishing industry concedes that elements of the existing arrangements are anticompetitive, but argue that the monopoly distributors enjoy in the regions ensures that even the most obscure publications are available in the smallest shop in the remotest village.</p> <p>The Dobson report points out that over the last decade 10,000 more retail outlets have begun selling newspapers and magazines, and that with \"very evident price competition\", there is \"effective competition operating in the market\".</p> <p>Professor Dobson - whose report was commissioned by the Block Exemption Initiative Group, which includes the PPA, the Newspaper Publishers Association and wholesalers - has looked at the situation in the US, where national distribution was introduced several years ago.</p> <p>If the same move were echoed here, he argues, magazine publishers would be the first to suffer, as a result of the buyer power multiple retailers would be able to exercise:</p> <p>\"The experience of magazine publishers in the US following a move to retailer-led national distribution was that multiples increased their margins, restricted ranges (where it is noticeable that the number of consumer magazine titles has almost halved in the last five years, falling from 9,311 in 1998 to 5,340 in 2002) and in some instances demanded a share of publishers' advertising income as well as seeking to influence product content.\"</p> <p>The PPA is calling for a \"new deal\" that would see existing arrangements kept in place, but an ombudsman appointed, performance targets for publishers and wholesalers introduced and compensation available for under-performance. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<b>The following correction was made on Tuesday August 17 2004</b> <br>  In the leader below, we correctly identified the Sun as first revealing the identity of the woman involved in the affair with a senior politician, but failed to attribute the quotation which followed (that the agonies of the relationship \"have not affected his ability to do his job. Which is how people should judge him.\") to the Daily Mirror. In fact, what the Daily Mirror said was that it was how \"the public\", rather than \"people\" should judge him.      To do the News of the World some credit, it did not claim that its revelation that a senior politician was involved in a relationship with a married woman was in the public interest. Quite the opposite. A leading article said explicitly that there was \"no reason\" to think that he had allowed the love affair to affect his work: he was still the right man for the job. Yesterday's Sun revealed his lover's identity - a mother of one - while also insisting that the agonies of the relationship \"have not affected his ability to do his job. Which is how people should judge him.\" <p>Since both papers went out of their way to insist that that there was no public justification for breaking the stories, it is not unreasonable to ask why they ploughed ahead. The most honest defence is that the story is undoubtedly interesting and will sell more copies. There are many media executives who believe this is the only reasonable doctrine, and that market forces alone should determine the public interest. If people don't want to read particular sorts of stories they needn't buy particular newspapers. </p> <p>This is fine as far as it goes, which is not very far. There will always be a readership for such stories, just as there is an audience for people having sex on television or for public floggings. The voyeur instinct is a strong one, and may explain our current obsession with celebrity, however mediocre. Newspapers are increasingly geared to exploit this taste, blurring information with entertainment in whatever mix will be commercially successful. The demand, we know, is constant. All that is needed is a steady supply of headline fodder, be they footballers, soap stars or politicians. </p> <p>But what of those Britons who don't want to know this stuff? There are plenty of people who think this new fashion for voyeurism has a poisonous effect on public life. Such people will, of course, do their best to avoid consuming the material. But their individual boycotts are unlikely to have sufficient economic consequences for the suppliers. A privacy law is not the answer - though it may be an unintended consequence. Instead, we should be asking ourselves how this happened to a country which - read any essay by George Orwell - used to have a sense of decency, of fairness and a respect for letting people alone? Sneaks and Peeping Toms, twitching behind net curtains, used to be despised. Now they are celebrated and rewarded for telling their tales, while we, as a nation, seem happy to lap them up. Those who squeal most loudly about the state's intrusion into personal lives have become the biggest nannies of all, prying where it pleases them and tutting away in their selective moral disapproval. It is something new, disturbing and un-British. But how to check it is rather more difficult.</p>",
  "<p>Thank you for taking time from your summer school to listen to my reflections on the state of education debate in our country. The opportunities for gifted and talented young people symbolise much that is changing in our education system, and I look forward to hearing from you your reflections on the summer school, and the work of the national academy, who are doing so much to take forward provision for you.</p> <p>I wanted to talk to you today because August is a good time to reflect on the state of our education system. On Thursday we get the A-level results; a week today the test results for 11-year-olds; on Thursday week the GCSE results.</p> <p>These figures are not the only guide to the health of our education system. Yet it is in August that scrutiny is often greatest, and it sets the tone for the year. </p> <p>The statistics for achievement at 11 over the last 10 years, and at 16 and 18 over the last 30 years, show that there is an education revolution underway in our country; it is an education revolution that is opening up educational opportunity to middle England for the first time; it is an education revolution built on the hard work of teachers, headteachers, support staff and governors; and it is an education revolution that is a force for massive economic and social change. </p> <p>But like any revolution, there are those who want to defend the old order of things. Wider and wider educational achievement is a challenge - for those who see danger in meritocracy, who see snakes and not just ladders in the educational rise of middle England. That is why the annual debate about test and exam results is so important. </p> <p>Today I want to put this debate in its proper context. The context of myths about education that mark out this country; myths that feed a culture where \"too clever by half\" is a good put-down, where \"boffin\" is a term of abuse; myths that stand in the way of the progress for hard-working pupils and families for whom education is a one-off chance to break into the winners' circle; myths that put up barriers of birth not merit to the rise of hard working pupils from all over the country.</p> <p><strong>The facts on rising achievement</strong><br></p> <p>Let me first set out the facts on pupil achievement as we know them from the August test and exam series. Since 1997:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> at age 11, primary school reforms have ensured that over 100,000 more children now read, write and count to high standard<br> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> at age 16, we have the best ever results at GCSE, with the percentage of students achieving five or more good grades increasing from about 45% in 1997 to 53% last year; that means an extra 65,000 students getting a passport into further study<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> and at age 18, of students who take post-16 qualifications, the proportion gaining the equivalent of three A-levels has risen from 61% to 71% last year; this is an extra 50,000 students. </p> <p>Over a 30-year period the figures are even more striking:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the number of students with the equivalent of five good GCSEs up from 150,000 in 1973 to 330,000 last year<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the number of students achieving the equivalent of two A-levels up from 78,000 to 240,000<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the total number of UK students in higher education up from 450,000 to 1,150,000.<br></p> <p>For girls, the picture over a 30-year period is remarkable. Since the introduction of mass comprehensive education girls have been the biggest gainers in terms of educational achievement. From a position 30 years ago where boys achievement outstripped girls, today the position is the reverse:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> from 75,000 boys and 73,000 girls achieving the equivalent of five good GCSEs in 1973, up to 150,000 boys but 180,000 girls did so last year<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> and from 44,000 boys and 34,000 girls with the equivalent of two A-levels in 1973, up to 110,000 boys but 130,000 girls did so last year.</p> <p>The gains in educational achievement have been greatest in the middle of the socio economic spectrum. Many of the parents of these successful pupils did not go to university themselves, but they are working hard to give their children the opportunities they never had. But, in addition since 1997, we have also seen some striking gains in the lowest income groups:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> in schools with over 50% of students receiving free school meals the average rate of improvement at GCSE since 1997 is double that of schools with less that 5% of students receiving free school meals<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the national 8% increase in students achieving five good grades at GCSE was been surpassed in urban areas by rises last year of 11% in London, 13% in Manchester and 14% in Birmingham<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> and at the end of primary school, the proportion of students achieving the expected level in English, maths and science has increased at double the rate of improvement in schools with over 40% of students receiving free school meals compared to those with less that 5%.<br></p> <p>For ethnic minorities there is also a very significant picture. Contrary to some commentary, it is not the case that ethnic minorities are at the bottom of the educational heap:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Chinese students are the highest achievers in our education system, with almost three quarters achieving five good GCSEs last year compared to over half our students nationally<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Indian pupils and pupils of mixed white and Asian heritage consistently achieve above the national average at all levels<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> and students from Black Caribbean communities, though still significantly behind, achieved the second fastest rate of improvement at GCSE last year, with achievement up by nearly four percentage points.<br></p> <p>So these are the facts as recorded in tests and exams. They seem to show real progress, despite continued problems that I do not in any way seek to underestimate. Yet every August the progress in achievement brings howls of anguish as well as tears of joy. </p> <p>In truth the great education debate every August more and more resembles a pantomime not a discussion. You know the script:<br></p> <p>Parents and pupils celebrate their results; relatives and neighbours are proud; local newspapers say: \"haven't they done well.\"</p> <p>And then there is a resounding chorus from self-appointed experts who shout: \"Oh no they haven't done well at all; things aren't what they used to be; it's the exams which have got easier not the standards of achievement that have risen.\"</p> <p>We must be the only country in the world where a spokesman for the opposition could believe it is an effective election gambit to say he would be proud to preside over an education system in which standards of attainment fall and more pupils fail. </p> <p>How to explain this? In his commencement address at Yale University in 1961, President John F Kennedy said that \"the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie...but the myth...the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought\". This is what we face today, and it is what I want to challenge.</p> <p><strong>The six myths</strong><br> </p> <p>There are six educational myths that perpetuate a debilitating cycle of low aspiration and educational confusion and underachievement. Each helps to maintain a fiction that the only successful education system is one where the majority fail to achieve - more or less the system which existed in the 1950s or 1960s, and which many of our critics see as a model.</p> <p>The first myth is that because there is an unchanging distribution and level of intelligence and aptitude, there should therefore be an unchanging distribution and level of educational achievement.</p> <p>This myth, like the others, is deepseated. It relies on two confusions:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the confusion between different types of intelligence. It is a truism that different people are good at different things. The American scholar Howard Gardener has identified eight different types of intelligence, from logical-mathematical to musical. And because different people are good at different things, it is silly to rely on a single metric of aptitude in measuring achievement. Increasingly our tests and exams are focusing on a broader range of intellectual competence than was traditionally measured by conventional IQ tests. For example, students are asked to apply knowledge as well as recall it. The result is that more of our youngsters are able to show what they are capable of.<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> there is also the confusion between intelligence or aptitude, and achievement. Whatever your potential, it is its realisation that is the vital task of education. And education systems can be more or less successful at fulfilling potential. So even with a given distribution of aptitudes, there is plenty of scope for education to become more successful at realising potential. For example, there are now an increasing range of teaching strategies that can substantially accelerate rates of learning and help students acquire a broader range of independent learning skills.</p> <p>My contention is not that today's students are born cleverer than their parents; it is that schools and teachers are getting better at getting the best out of them.</p> <p>The second myth is that fairness is the enemy of excellence. But why should this be so?</p> <p>First, there is nothing in mass achievement that holds back excellent performance; in fact it widens the talent pool from which best performers are drawn and increases competition for top places. The result is not only a more open society, but also one where the average standard of achievement rises.</p> <p>Second, excellence can be used as a locomotive for systemic improvement. This is the experience of specialist schools and the Excellence in Cities programme in education. They demonstrate that by using best practice to generate improvement across a network of schools excellence becomes a resource for a fairer system. </p> <p>It is profoundly wrong to assume that a glass ceiling on high achievement presents the only path to high equity. But it is equally misguided to see the drive to help more pupils achieve as the enemy of high performance. Excellence should be the ally of equity not its enemy.</p> <p>The third myth is that education cannot overcome poverty. There is no question that children growing up in secure housing with facilities for homework and support for extra-curricula activities have an in-built advantage when it comes to educational achievement. But we should never fall for the lie that middle and lower income families without a history of educational achievement do not want the best for their children; nor should we fall for the \"poverty of aspiration\" that Ernest Bevin diagnosed in the 1940s.</p> <p>The barriers to achievement presented by low income are just that - barriers; and it is the job of the education system to overcome them. The correlation between low income and low achievement is a challenge to provision. And the performance of some secondary schools in our most challenging areas show what education can do:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Selly Park girls school in Birmingham, with over 50% of students eligible for free school meals, has made striking improvements. From just 27% of students getting five good GCSEs in 1996 up to 82% last year<br></p> <p>- and Loxford school of science and technology in Ilford, East London, with over 40% of students eligible for free school meals, is also bucking the national trend: from 31% of students achieving five good GCSEs in 1997 to 65% last year.<br> </p> <p>The fourth myth is that a mass public service like education, precisely because it has to cater for all talents and all interests, can never deliver the sort of personalised help that is offered in the private sector. Mass state education is condemned by the lowest common denominator. </p> <p>Some of you may have felt the justice of this criticism in the past. I have been told by some of our most gifted children that they have simply been bored at school. But that is not inevitable. It is precisely the challenge of universal systems to deliver for the individual, to put the individual at the centre. That is the promise of what I call personalised learning - not pupils learning on their own but every pupil with the curriculum and teaching suited to the needs, interests and aptitudes. And the extraordinary development of gifted and talent provision over the last five years is testimony to what is possible:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the gifted and talented programme now reaches over 150,000 students in 2000 maintained primary and 1000 maintained secondary schools<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> we now expect there to be a trained Gifted and Talented co-ordinator in every participating school, ensuring that students receive a tailored teaching and learning programme<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> and the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth at Warwick University, now delivers a range of learning opportunities to the 33,000 members of its Student Academy, of whom over a thousand will be participating in this year's summer schools at Warwick, Lancaster, Exeter, Durham, York, Canterbury and here at Imperial.<br> </p> <p>The fifth myth is that however compelling the logic for improved provision, the education system is so riven by vested interests that it cannot deliver progress. </p> <p>Too often, there is easy grist provided for this mill. But credit is needed where it is due. I believe there is increasing recognition in the trade unions representing all those involved in the education system that unless they work to retain the confidence of the public then all their aspirations for their members will come to nought. I base this assertion on two pieces of evidence:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the cooperation to bring new flexibility to the deployment of school staff, focussing teachers on teaching and freeing them up from non-teaching tasks, has shown both the teacher and the support staff trade unions in a good light; they are committed to workforce reform because it is right for their members and right for pupils<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the agreement with the teacher unions to restructure the upper pay scale, so that the highest rewards for classroom teaching are for excellence, is further proof of their commitment to think in new ways about how to drive up standards for all pupils. It shows that, even in traditionally confrontational areas such as teachers pay, a basis is being found for constructive dialogue and reform.</p> <p>I believe we have a historic opportunity to fashion a radical consensus within the education system about the need for reform; that is the purpose of the five-year strategy published by Charles Clarke in July; it has at its heart a major commitment to staff development, to more freedom and independence for headteachers and to greater personalisation for students so that their needs and talents are put at centre of everything we do.</p> <p>The strategy is backed by significant investment. Money is no guarantee of improvement, but wise investment in education will reap dividends.</p> <p>The sixth myth, the biggest myth of all, the myth that underpins all the others, is the myth that in the famous phrase of Kingsley Amis in the 1950s, \"more will mean worse\", that more education for more people will mean lower standards, that more people getting more qualifications will mean worse qualifications. This is the myth that underpins all the allegations that fly around in August: that anyone can get an A, that exams used to be tougher, that university graduates cannot write or count, that new-fangled subjects like psychology are easy.</p> <p>There is long tradition standing behind this myth. The 18th century writer Bernard Mandeville said that education would \"initiate the poor into a life of crime, sloth and discontent, and permanently incapacitate them for hard, honest labour\". Disraeli's 19th century reformism was met with the argument that education would be wasted on the masses. It was a sentiment repeated when Balfour brought in the 1902 Education Act. And it is echoed today when the need for 50% of young people to go into higher education is questioned.</p> <p>The premise is simple. Educational achievement is preordained at birth. So a greater number of young people cannot be expected to achieve at the level previously reserved for the elite. And if more are doing so, then it is because the exams are getting easier or the standards being dropped, not the teaching and learning getting better. This is the argument I think it is so important to refute.</p> <p><strong>More Does not Mean Worse</strong><br></p> <p>I have no interest in handing out certificates to people who do not deserve them; I have no interest in pretending to young people that they are capable of something when they clearly are not. But rejecting the myth that more means worse does not mean a culture of prizes for all. My view is that pupils who reach a high standard should be recognised with high results. I will address in a moment recognition of the most able. Those who don't reach the standard should not get the grade. Yet unlike my opponents, I do not believe that there will only ever be a set number of pupils capable of doing well.</p> <p>The allegation that the government is wilfully encouraging or allowing the misrepresentation of student achievement is a very serious one. So I want to go through the different threads of this allegation very carefully.</p> <p>First, there is the suggestion that the questions, marks or grades reflect political imperatives. This is completely untrue. The content and standards of public examinations are the responsibility of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, which is an independent organisation established by law. It regulates the awarding bodies. Neither ministers nor my department have powers to intervene in the marking, grading and moderating of public exams. </p> <p>Second, that changes to course structure, notably the shift to modular studies or the use of coursework, are somehow suspect. Yet the key to the rigour and demand of any qualification is the curriculum content and the method of assessment. And exactly the same standard is applied to qualifications using modular as to terminal exams. The process by which grades are set is the same. The level of challenge is the same. And Ofsted's 1999 report on modular A-levels confirmed that standards in modular and linear syllabuses had been consistent. Modular qualifications offer students regular feedback on their work to help them make progress; but this does not make the degree of challenge easier; nor does it substitute for end of course \"synoptic\" papers, which must count for at least 20% of the course.</p> <p>Third, that standards are being allowed to slip even though the process is independent and the course structure is not flawed. The current system for comparing standards over time was introduced in 1987. It seeks to ensure that any grade given to a candidate in one year is comparable with what they might achieve had they sat the same exam in an earlier year. Two independent studies in the last decade have found no evidence of \"dumbing down\". But there is always need for vigilance. That is why the QCA has established an independent committee, chaired by Barry McGaw, of the OECD, to review and advise them on standards. This will report for the first time in the autumn.</p> <p>Fourth, that even if standards are not being allowed to slip, any system in which the vast majority of people pass must be a farce; but in fact Cambridge University report that less than 1% of students fail to get a degree in their finals. No one pretends that standards are slipping at Cambridge.</p> <p>The fifth allegation is that a system where one in five entrants gets an A is by definition failing in its functions. Leave to one side for the moment the point that only around one in 20 A-level candidates gets As in each of the six modules that make up an A-level, or that in an age cohort of over half a million just 22,000 got three A grades last year. Universities and employers do need a means to select the highest achievers. But my argument is that that need is no basis for marking down the successful efforts of an increasing number of candidates. </p> <p>I have a strong interest in developing a 14-19 education system that stretches achievement at every level of the ability range. For our most able youngsters, we are now discussing how to recognise distinctive achievement. The Tomlinson Inquiry into the future of 14-19 education is going to come forward with a range of ways to recognise top achievement. Good. The answer to rising numbers of A grades is not to shift the goalposts so more people are downgraded, but instead to create new opportunities for the most able young people to distinguish themselves. Vigilance and reform, yes; myth-making, no.<br></p> <p><strong>A challenge to the myth makers</strong><br> </p> <p>This argument for reform contains within it a challenge to the myth makers who talk down educational achievement every summer. When the facts say teaching standards are rising; when the facts confirm the rigour of tests and exams; when the facts show that the growth in pupils doing well comes from middle England families; the only conclusion we can draw when commentators talk of \"dumbing down\" is that they believe middle England has neither the brains nor the talent to do well. </p> <p>So my message to them is simple: stop saying pupils from middle England haven't got the brains to do well at school. Stop saying to the children of those who have not gone to university in the past, who live from Plymouth to Redditch to Sunderland, that there is a charmed circle of educational achievement and it has big Keep Out signs all around it. Stop saying to all those girls who were previously failing to achieve as well as their male peers that their results now overestimate their potential. </p> <p>The government's fight is on behalf of hard-earned merit not easy prizes. We stand for success based on worth not birth. And we will not be distracted from building wider educational opportunities by those who see a danger in meritocracy.</p> <p>Our job is to be vigilant on behalf of every student, vigilant in organising the independent setting of standards, vigilant in ensuring that curriculum and teaching is stretching and testing. But when that merit is being shown day in day out in schools right across middle England, our job is to stand up for that merit and for that achievement. </p> <p>We know that the 21st century demands citizens and employees with more knowledge not less, more skills not less, more creativity not less. The evidence is that despite the problems that still afflict too many pupils in too many schools, we are getting better as a country at getting the best out of our young people. We should applaud them and applaud their schools. </p> <p>This is an argument about our future as a country - open and meritocratic or closed and hidebound.

  "<p>There are more than enough noble pedigrees listed on the walls of the Royal Scottish Academy at the moment to confirm William Blake's belief that the cult of Titian manifested a coarse aristocratic appetite for luxury. Each painting here glorifies a nob: you look at Francesco Bassano's The Israelites Drinking the Miraculous Water, courtesy of a 19th-century earl of Crawford and Balcarres, and behold a portrait of Doge Francesco Don\u00e0 from Titian's workshop, through the magnificence of the earls of Bute. </p> <p>The Age of Titian: Venetian Renaissance Art from Scottish Collections is a rum idea for an exhibition that celebrates the expansion of the National Gallery of Scotland into an exhibition space in the Royal Scottish Academy - surely an occasion to rejoice in public museums rather than private wealth. But this gallery has a history of helping Scotland's aristos to show off, not always with happy results. After the Duke of Buccleuch lent a studio version of Leonardo da Vinci's Madonna of the Yardwinder to an exhibition here, someone stole the painting from the Duke's castle. </p> <p>It is difficult now to credit that Titian and the Venetian school of painting have not always been universally admired. In the 18th century, when many of the paintings here entered British collections, the cult of Titian was divisive, even political. Aristocrats loved Titian, radicals loathed him. William Blake revered Michelangelo with his bold design and inner vision, and raged that Titian's soft, yielding sensuality was becoming fashionable - so fashionable that a young girl's claim to have discovered the secret of Titian's colouring caused a national sensation in the 1790s. Blake raged at the appetite for Titian's \"sickly daubs\". </p> <p>This appetite was insatiable. Titian's paintings were bought in immense quantities by the British upper class during the 18th and 19th centuries. Because of this, we have more Titians per square inch than almost anywhere else on earth. The National Gallery in London has an abundance, and its Edinburgh equivalent owns or has on loan enough to give this exhibition an extravagant heart. Blake could get as angry as he liked; the cult of Titian was a cultural obsession of the ruling class throughout the British isles, even in the remotest highland castle. </p> <p>Why did the wealthy of Britain empathise so deeply with Renaissance Venice? Perhaps because Britain, like Venice, was an oligarchy. Venice was a republic, with an elected head of state, the Doge; but the political class was restricted to old, rich families, and in a city whose population was inherently limited, they never faced a revolution, or even a serious riot. An elite enriched by its monopoly of the Mediterranean spice trade could do what it liked - indulge every whim, without having to worry about the social order. It was a rich man's utopia. </p> <p>I can only imagine that wealthy art collectors in the British isles felt a special empathy for this city. But I'm clutching at straws. Because however much my hackles rose at the idea of this show - at the eccentricity, even laziness, of creating a blockbuster Venice exhibition almost entirely from posh Scottish collections - the result is sublime. </p> <p>This is a wonderful exhibition because it contains so many things that are not of the very best. Not all the paintings that hung in 18th- and 19th-century lairds' salons were Titians. Not all were even Tintorettos. The vast majority of paintings here are by minor 16th-century masters, from Jacopo Bassano to Paris Bordon. </p> <p>So why did I love them? It was partly the light: the Scottish Academy has been spruced up into a superbly lit space where natural light hits the canvases in just the proper way, gently touching time-darkened trees and blue horizons and allowing the eye to find its own way into the oily depths without being browbeaten by spotlights. </p> <p>Venetian painting deserves and needs this subtle display. It is painting for the sake of it. There really is, as William Blake raged, a fundamental difference between the painting of Venice and that of Florence. In fact, when Blake contrasted Titian's \"sickly\" vagueness with the precise design of the Florentine Michelangelo, he was repeating what Michelangelo himself said when he visited Titian's workshop and saw the master's painting Dana\u00eb, today in the Capodimonte museum in Naples. It was a nice bit of painting, sniffed Michelangelo - just a shame these Venetians didn't learn to draw. </p> <p>Art in 16th-century Florence gloried in ideas firmly drawn, then coloured. Venetians departed from drawing into free festivals of colour; theirs was an aristocratic manner, a luxury painting. They set out to ravish, titillate, enrapture. Titian didn't care about arguments and allegories; he cared about the eye and its right to absolute pleasure. </p> <p>The most sumptuous painting in this show is Titian's Diana and Actaeon. Done in the late 1550s for Philip II of Spain, it narrates the unfortunate moment when Actaeon, out hunting just as a Renaissance prince or a Scottish landowner might be out hunting, came across the virgin goddess and her nymphs, bathing naked. In a painting now in London, Titian shows the agony that follows for Actaeon - transformed into a stag by the furious goddess, chased by his own hounds, torn to pieces. But in the painting in the National Gallery of Scotland, there is a dynamic soaring, or floating, as Actaeon puts up his hands and rears back in surprise yet can't stop moving forward. Diana arches up, reaching for a cloth to hide herself, blushing behind her white arm, but the nymphs don't mind being seen: they happily spread out their flesh for Actaeon, and for the beholder of the painting, and disport on stone carved with masks and cupids reflected in green-blue water as sheer as glass. </p> <p>You can move from this painting to a case containing Venetian glass, and see the same transparent perfection: a goblet made in the late 16th century with what is called vetro a retorti decoration, a dazzling spiral system of filigree tubes that transforms this drinking vessel into something divine. This exhibition places Titian's paintings not just against the backdrop of his rivals and imitators but within the hedonism of a civilisation that knew it was privileged, and exulted in every pleasure money could buy. The Venice we see here, through the prism of Scottish fantasies, is a fabled city of delight, that glass goblet as stupendous as a Titian. For serenely affluent Venetians 500 years ago, such things were everyday objects. </p> <p>Women were even more available. Venetian patrician society not only tolerated but flaunted courtesans, who star in some of the best Venetian paintings. Titian's Venus Anadyomene is not really a subtle allegorical vision of Venus rising from the waves; it is a painting of naked female flesh, white and bright against a low-toned, even gloomy seascape - as if, turning his eyes from the sea that made Venice rich, Titian prefers to look at a woman. Venus wrings the salt water out of her long curly brown hair, and it is not a goddess but a model who is posing for Titian, a woman he likes to look at. </p> <p>And yet, with all this sensuality, there was a seriousness to 16th-century Venice, even an anxiety. It was not an easy time for the empire. In 1494 a French invasion of Italy began four decades of war and chaos in the peninsula. At the same time, Vasco da Gama's circumnavigation of Africa opened a Portuguese trade with Asia that would ultimately marginalise Venice's Mediterranean routes. </p> <p>There are nuances of melancholy in Venetian painting that deepen its emotional authority. The National Gallery of Scotland owns one of the most haunting examples of this darkening palette: a painting of a young man in armour, wearing an archer's leather glove, that is attributed to the legendary Giorgione, or one of his close followers. Giorgione was Titian's contemporary and rival, but unlike the long-lived Titian he died young, of the plague. His corpus of paintings is constantly being reassigned, but we know he influenced Titian. And this particular painting is a miracle. The archer looks sensitively out of a stygian background, his steel breastplate a reflective pool of foreboding; an uneasy, valedictory picture of a youth going to the wars. </p> <p>Half a century later, from the last years of Titian's life, comes an equally intimate image. It is a round medal in coloured wax of the ancient Titian, with a white beard, holding a framed portrait of his son Orazio, in his prime. The medallion is shown next to Titian's great Allegory of Prudence, in which Titian similarly juxtaposes his wizened profile with the virility of Orazio. Orazio was his favourite son, a painter he hoped would carry on the family fame. But they both died in 1576, when plague ravaged Venice. </p> <p>So this little wax portrait of the greatest Venetian painter and his son is a heartbreaking document. It expresses all the old man's hopes, destined to be blown away on the salt wind. With that and many other little treasures, this exhibition achieves something that last year's Titian show in London and Madrid did not. That gave you Titian's art; this gives you Titian the man.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Age of Titian: Venetian Renaissance Art from Scottish Collections is at the Royal Scottish Academy Building, Edinburgh until December 5.

  "<p>John Godber is one of the reasons I became a playwright. I saw Up'n' Under and Bouncers in the late 1980s in Hull - it was the first time I'd seen a play I understood, and which spoke to me about my life growing up in West Yorkshire. Since then, Godber has gone on to become one of the most widely performed playwrights in Britain, while also becoming unfashionable in the eyes of the London-based cognoscenti. </p> <p>His highly personal plays invariably balance emotional honesty and sentimentality. His latest, Beef and Yorkshire Pudding, is perhaps his most nakedly autobiographical. It tells the tale of Dave, a weedy 18-year-old from Upton (Godber's home town), who is weight-training in his father's garage in an attempt to win back his girlfriend and overcome his bullies. </p> <p>The second half of the show flashes forward in time. Dave is now a successful stand-up comic; his routine is based on growing up in the mining villages in the 1970s and 1980s, and how he feels about that background now that he has made it. It's a neat idea and a clever way for Godber to explore his relationship with his parents and his past, a subject at the heart of much of his work. And in Nick Lane he has found the perfect actor to play himself. </p> <p>However, while there are some cracking one-liners - \"If you let 'em shit on you all your life, what are you? A piece of rhubarb\" - this is not Godber at his best. At times the piece lacks focus. There is still much to savour, however, and when Dave thanks those who bullied and oppressed him for spurring him on to escape the drudgery of a life down the mines, the play really hits home. There was a power cut halfway through the peformance I saw, so the audience were treated to Nick Lane improvising in the dark - which was every bit as funny as his on-stage routine. </p> <p>Godber is a serious popular dramatist; British theatre needs more writers like him, and critics should be encouraging his work instead of obsessing over the insular London scene. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Beef and Yorkshire Pudding is at Assembly at St George's West until August 30.

  "Most people can remember the Fiji coup four years ago, when George Speight - a flogger of pyramid schemes with the build and shaved head of a prop forward - took the country's government hostage for two months. <p>The whiff of violence and trouble in a Pacific paradise gave worldwide media attention to the standoff, but since then few have shown much interest in the country's fate. A friend summed up the situation a few weeks ago by wondering: \"Isn't everything there back to normal?\" </p> <p>Well, to a point. Things in Fiji are back to normal now, but it is a form of normality where democracy and respect for the rule of law often come second to ethnic chauvinism. </p> <p>When British colonialists turned Fiji into a sugar plantation in the 19th century, they were dismayed at the refusal of the natives to do the work that they had no intention of doing themselves. To help things along, Her Majesty's government brought 60,000 Indians to the Pacific on exploitative contracts which these days would see it done for people smuggling. </p> <p>That movement of labour is at the bottom of Fiji's ethnic problems. Indo-Fijians make up 44% of the population and 51% are indigenous Melanesians, with Europeans and Asians making up most of the balance. The landowners are all indigenous, the mercantile classes Indo-Fijian, and the poor a mixture of both. </p> <p>There is little love lost between the two majority groups. Many indigenous Fijians believe the Indo-Fijians are foreign colonialists bent on stealing their country; many Indo-Fijians believe the Melanesians are feckless and violent. </p> <p>Twice in the past 20 years the Fiji Labour party, an officially multiracial party dominated by Indo-Fijians, has won power. Both times, a coup has restored the status quo within a matter of months. </p> <p>Back in 1987, when the FLP first made it to office, Indo-Fijians made up a slim minority of the country. But two coups and a new constitution, slanted in favour of the islanders, reweighted the demographic balance during the 1990s, as thousands of Indo-Fijians upped and left for an easier life in Australia or New Zealand. </p> <p>Even so, when the main discriminatory aspects of the constitution were rubbed out in 1997, the first elections held under the new rules again returned the FLP to power with a landslide under the country's first Indo-Fijian prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry. </p> <p>A year later, the Speight coup overturned this and restored Melanesian rule. The army intervened to end the hostage crisis, and the world acquiesced as Chaudhry was summarily removed as prime minister and replaced by indigenous banker Laisenia Qarase. A year later, the general election was won by Qarase's United Fiji party (SDL) with the slenderest of majorities. </p> <p>Qarase knows how to dress up his government's chauvinism in more fetching anti-colonialist colours. </p> <p>After the country's vice-president Ratu Jope Seniloli was jailed earlier this month for treason over his role in the Speight coup, Qarase blamed the courts: \"The conviction shows that the western law ignores the cultural problems,\" he explained. Presumably a law which paid proper attention to \"cultural problems\" would have no argument with an anti-democratic coup founded on ethnic hatred and corruption. </p> <p>The connections between Seniloli and Speight were not merely incidental. The deputy president is Ratu, or leader, of Speight's clan, and the coup leader did Seniloli the honour of phoning him on the morning of the coup to say that everything was going to plan. The next day, while Chaudhry and his government were being held hostage in the parliament complex, Seniloli turned up to swear in Speight's indigenous government. </p> <p>But Seniloli's imprisonment on a four-year term has still engendered breast beating among the Melanesians who run Fiji. There have been calls for an official pardon from the highest levels, and local police are on the alert for plans to instigate riots to bring about the vice-president's release. In a sign of popular anger in the country, two Hindu temples have been vandalised in the past week. </p> <p>Compare Fiji to the other relics of colonialism scattered around the Pacific, and you have to wonder what the indigenous Fijians have got to complain about. </p> <p>The cabinet's only Indo-Fijian, George Shiu Raj, holds the low-level multi-ethnic affairs portfolio. Despite three years of legal challenges to bring the government into line with the 1997 constitution, which guarantees cabinet representation for all major parties, the FLP is still consigned to the status of permanent opposition. </p> <p>Melanesians still own nearly all the country's agricultural land and charge crippling rents to the Indo-Fijian sugar cane farmers on whom the country's economy depends. Many of these landowners feel wealthy enough to spare their rents and let the land lie fallow out of spite, forcing the Indo-Fijian farmers to seek work in the slums growing at the fringes of the country's main cities. </p> <p>It all looks strikingly like the sort of government that Speight would have been happy with, and, to many in Fiji, it seems that his crime was one of presentation, rather than absolute morality. To this way of thinking, there is no problem with rigging politics to exclude half of Fiji's population from government, as long as it is done discreetly enough that the rest of the world does not notice.</p>",

We're teaching these singers that inciting homophobic violence does not pay. It is costing them dear in lost revenue and income.\"</p> <p>But a prosecution over the lyrics would be contentious, with complicating factors including arguments over free speech, varying translations of the patois Beenie Man uses and the question of who should face charges for which offences.</p> <p>The director of public prose cutions, Ken Macdonald, has taken personal responsibility for the case, an indication of its sensitivity.</p> <p>Chief Superintendent Clive Driscoll, the officer leading the Metropolitan police inquiry, said: \"It's a difficult investigation.

But a spokeswoman for the label's owners, EMI, stressed that none of the controversial lyrics had appeared on tracks issued by Virgin. She declined to comment on the label's decision to sign the singer. The songs which allegedly incite violence have been released on smaller labels, most if not all of which are based in Jamaica.</p> <p>They include lyrics such as \"Hang chi chi gal wid a long piece of rope\" [Hang lesbians with a long piece of rope] and \"Tek a bazooka and kill batty-fucker\" [Take a bazooka and kill gay men].</p> <p>Outrage! hope that last year's prosecution of the extremist Muslim cleric Abdullah el-Faisal for soliciting the murder of Jews, Hindus and other non-Muslims has set a precedent for bringing a charge of incitement to murder.</p> <p>It might also be possible to bring charges under the Public Order Act, such as using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. However, that would require someone to have been put in fear of immediate unlawful violence. A defence lawyer would be likely to argue that a singer could not expect those individuals to be put in fear when he recorded a track.</p> <p>There is no offence of inciting homophobic hatred as there is in the case of racial hatred. Ben Summerskill, chief executive of Stonewall, said: \"It's absolutely appropriate that there should be legislation [protecting the gay community] that matches incitement to hatred in relation to race. In a civilised society the right to free speech does have constraints and one of those is that you shouldn't incite violence against other people.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month Virgin Records issued a statement from Beenie Man, which offered his \"sincerest apologies to those who might have been offended, threatened or hurt by my songs\".</p> <p>But the following day the head of his management company in Jamaica said that the statement was \"not an apology\" and that the singer reserved his right to criticise \"the homosexual lifestyle\".</p> <p><strong> theguardian.com/arts</strong><br></p>",
  "The culture department yesterday took the rare step of serving a compulsory purchase order on a stately home. It is to buy the once magnificent Apethorpe Hall, near Peterborough and its 60 acres (24 hectares) of land to save the property from near-terminal decay. <p>But the department stressed that it hopes the taxpayer will not be stuck for long with the grade one listed 15th century mansion and a potential seven-figure yearly maintenance bill. The cost of immediately needed repairs is unofficially estimated at \u00a312m. </p> <p>The government indicated that it will urgently seek a private buyer with deep pockets, reliable intentions and an ambition to emulate Queen Elizabeth I and King James I in sleeping at Apethorpe. </p> <p>The market is likely to include the millionaire London leather trader Simon Karimzadeh, who voiced an interest in Apethorpe Hall earlier this year. \"It's a Great Gatsby sort of a place,\" he said. </p> <p>He added yesterday that he was discussing a legal appeal to the high court against the order. He said he had already spent \u00a33.1m in exchanging contracts to buy the hall, although he was not yet the legal owner. </p> <p>Compulsory purchase is a weapon associated more with the nationalising Attlee Labour government of 1945-51 than with Blairism. \"This is not a decision I take lightly,\" the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, said. </p> <p>\"Apethorpe Hall is a rare and beautiful building of truly national historic importance. It is an irreplaceable treasure that without decisive action could be lost to us forever.\" </p> <p>The honey-coloured stone house, described as hauntingly beautiful, has been high on English Heritage's endangered buildings register since this was first compiled in 1998. </p> <p>Five years ago, visitors found its superb Jacobean plaster ceilings propped up with scaffolding. Gaping holes in the roof were patched with tarpaulin and wooden battens. Dry and wet rot was rife in timber and plaster. It has been empty for years. </p> <p>The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said its deteriorating fabric made it \"among the greatest priority conservation cases in the country\". Repairs would be started while the hall was being marketed to help save it from further damage in the winter. </p> <p>Its longstanding owner, Wanis Burweila, a Libyan businessman, was thought to have spent few nights there. He left Britain with much of the Libyan community after the Libyan London embassy siege and the shooting of PC Yvonne Fletcher in 1984.

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>THREE MISSING IN FLASH FLOODS</b></p> <p>Evidently glad to have a real news story on their hands, the broadsheets jostle to present the most dramatic photo of the flash floods which devastated the Cornish town of Boscastle yesterday. The Times has an aerial shot of a helicopter circling the town of grey slate roofs, with a torrent of water streaming down the high street. Inside, a 3D graphic shows how the convergence of three valleys \"in a deep coomb\" at Boscastle, near Tintagel on the north coast of Cornwall, led to the sudden and devastating floods. Rescue services told the paper that up to 1,000 people were affected by the floods, many trapped on roofs, up trees and in cars.</p> <p>The Guardian shows a young man and woman being winched up from a roof as the flood waters swirl round the town. It says that at one point a three metre wave of water rushed down the town's streets, and that more than 30 cars were washed out into the harbour. The town's bridge and harbour wall were badly damaged. </p> <p>Winner by a nose in the photo competition is the Telegraph, which devotes the width of its front page to a street of pretty pastel coloured houses - Boscastle is a popular tourist town - facing onto what appears to be a riverbed, but is in fact the town centre. In the middle of the frame four cars are piled one on top of the other, where the floodwaters have dashed them against an outhouse. The report says three people are known to be missing, although the police added that there was, understandably, \"great confusion\".</p> <p>Boscastle may take some heart from the arrival on the scene of John Prescott, who the Guardian says is on his way to the area. Over the weekend, the deputy PM pulled a concussed canoeist out of a mountain river in Snowdonia, though he has played down the incident.</p> <p>The Independent follows up the report with a piece on those celebrity saviours in full; it recalls a somewhat over-spun rescue by Tony Blair, later dismissed as \"absurd\" by its supposed beneficiary, and the drunken man hauled from a canal by Paddy Ashdown, who remarked soggily to his saviour: \"Oh God, my fags are all wet.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weather/Story/0,2763,1284777,00.html\">Three missing as flood hits village</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Politics/backbench/story/0,14158,1284631,00.html\">Prescott secures white water vote</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=LJ5T4NTLRB5PZQFIQMGCNAGAVCBQUJVC?xml=/news/2004/08/17/ustorm.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/08/17/ixportaltop.html\">Telegraph: Prescott joins flood rescue operation</a></p> <p><b>CHAVEZ RETURNED ON HIGHEST EVER TURNOUT</b></p> <p>The FT devotes its front page picture not to Boscastle but to Caracas in Venezuela, where a triumphant President Hugo Chavez won his recall referendum yesterday.</p> <p>Its headline, \"Chavez victory eases pressure on oil prices\", explains why the vote matters to the FT, but is incidentally the same tack taken by the Guardian. Both papers say the opposition has alleged fraud, even though the Organisation of American States and the Carter Centre endorsed the result. The FT says this will continue to trouble the oil markets as \"the unpredictable politics of the world's fifth biggest oil exporter\" lead to worries about further political instability</p> <p>The Guardian is more optimistic. It says that turnout - at 8.5m from an electorate of 14m - was lower than billed yesterday; early figures put it at 80%. But it is still the country's highest ever, and with 94.4% of the ballots counted, President Chavez emerged with 58.25% of the vote.</p> <p>The paper's leader alludes to Mr Chavez's contention that much of the opposition against him is stirred up by Washington. \"It was, surely, a great victory for democracy ... of the kind for which George Bush is striving throughout the world.\" It goes on to gently rubbish suggestions that Mr Chavez is undemocratic because he courts the poor, saying that \"to win votes by embarking on policies that benefit the majority of voters is hardly a sensation in most democratic societies, including our own.\" </p> <p>The Telegraph is firmly in the other camp. It focuses on disturbances in Caracas after the result was announced, saying Chavez supporters fired on opposition protestors. Its leader says Chavez has run the Venezuelan oil industry into the ground - a claim the Guardian leader explicitly contradicts - and frets about Mr Chavez's avowed wish to \"export the revolution\". It is, says the Telegraph, \"dangerous enough at home; its export would be bloodier\".</p> <p>Lastly, Tariq Ali makes a striking claim in the Independent. \"The turn-out in Venezuela on Sunday was huge; 94.9% of the electorate voted in the recall referendum.\" You'll remember that number from all the other reports as the amount of votes so far counted, not the turnout. Ali goes on to recount his conversations with Chavez, in which the president explains his undogmatic policy of helping the poor without embracing Marxism, but his opening gambit hardly inspires confidence.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/venezuela/story/0,12716,1284671,00.html\">Venezuela votes for Chavez amid cries of foul play</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/ae8edadc-ef05-11d8-848a-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Chavez success helps to ease pressure on oil</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml;sessionid=LJ5T4NTLRB5PZQFIQMGCNAGAVCBQUJVC?xml=/opinion/2004/08/17/dl1702.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/08/17/ixportal.html\">Telegraph: Venezuelan exports</a></p> <p><b>US WITHDRAWS TROOPS FROM EUROPE AND ASIA</b></p> <p>Poor Dubya. President Bush can't seem to do anything this week without allegations of cynical vote-grabbing. Yesterday it was comforting victims of hurricane Charley, today it's announcing that 70,000 military personnel, and a further 100,000 civilian employees, are to be withdrawn from \"cold war\" arenas in Asia and Europe and redeployed, many of them operating from bases in the US.</p> <p>The Independent quotes the Democrat general Wesley Clark, who said the timing seemed \"politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security.\"</p> <p>In his speech, Mr Bush said the \"world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it,\" and that the redeployment would make US forces \"more agile and flexible\". </p> <p>The FT's leader sums up what it sees as the import of the move in the headline to its leader: \"The empire moves its frontiers\". In a broad-ranging piece, which does not neglect the decision by the Roman emperor Honorius to remove his troops from Britain in the early fifth century, the FT says it is logical to bring an end to military dispositions designed for the cold war. \"It makes little sense to keep two of the US army's ten armoured divisions stationed in the Bavarian forest.\"</p> <p>But this is not, it says, \"a retreat from empire\". The real issue, says the paper, is that the US has so many troops committed to Iraq and Afghanistan that it must change its attitude. Indeed, the biggest problem is that the US has too few soldiers, making this a case of \"rearranging the deck chairs\". John Kerry, it notes approvingly, has promised to recruit 40,000 new soldiers.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1284627,00.html\">US to pull back troops from Asia and Europe</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=552288\">Independent: Bush orders exodus of troops in US and Asia</a></p> <p><b>SADR HOLDING OUT IN NAJAF</b></p> <p>The Independent goes its own way, as is often the case. And, as is often the case, that means Iraq. It runs a report from Najaf, where supporters of Moqtada al-Sadr and others are forming a \"human shield\" around the shrine of Imam Ali, the holy city's holiest building. But the paper reports that Iraqi police are continuing to intimidate journalists in the city, and says an attempt to draw Mr Sadr's people into political discussions in Baghdad has come to nothing. </p> <p>There is a little comfort to be gleaned from the Guardian's report: the headline reads \"Baghdad tries new Najaf peace bid\", which is the first time the Wrap has seen \"Baghdad\" used to mean \"the Iraqi government\" since the war.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1284724,00.html\">Baghdad tries new Najaf peace bid</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=552289\">Independent: Najaf: City of defiance</a></p> <p> <b>UNINVITED TUTU DISRUPTS DIVING IN ATHENS</b></p> <p>After yesterday's gloomfest, the papers are starting to develop a bit of Olympic spirit.

British TV audiences, it seems, have also been very healthy. </p> <p>The Independent reports on strange events at the three-metre synchronised diving yesterday, when a bare-chested intruder in a tutu interrupted proceedings to offer the judges his inelegant and unsynchronised contribution to the display.</p> <p>He was arrested for his pains. But to the athletes, the damage was already done, as broken concentration lead to a series of errors.

  "<p>Alan Whicker is such a television icon that even he refers to himself in the third person. \"So how long,\" he asks, in <strong>Whicker's War</strong> (Channel 4), as he returned to the Italy he had seen in 1943 as part of the Army Film and Photo Unit, \"could Whicker's luck hold?\" The second world war, you might note, has also become his. </p> <p>You don't begrudge this indulgence. Whicker, unlike so many Big Brother wannabees, has earned his status. This moving, slick and sometimes gently irritating documentary is proof of that status: the war is only of interest here because we glimpse into his experience of it. Part travelogue (Sicily obliges and looks lovely, all olive groves and empty beaches baked by a golden sun), part memoir, this had all the details and impressionistic wobbliness that official histories like to disregard. </p> <p>So Whicker remembered that his unit happened to land in Sicily, a great place for tomatoes. \"By chance\", he says, a fat ripe tomato in hand, \"we'd landed in the best tomato-growing area in Italy.\" Whicker poshly transforms the island to \"Sissilay\" and makes it sound all lacy. The reality, we sense through the archive footage, was anything but. </p> <p>Early on, Whicker sets out his impressive stall: any images we have seen of the second world war, he explains, were probably taken by his unit. These films and photographs of broken bodies and bloody battles punctuate Whicker's account, and the documentary is strongest in melding the archive material and his memories of it. That reliable, unchanging extra, the sea, is used as a link, with antique and modern-day waves blurring into each other, and when Whicker talks about standing up in the back of a jeep during wartime to see dangers that might be approaching, he stands up in the back of the jaunty jeep in which he is travelling across Italy. </p> <p>Whicker's talent, as a great televisual storyteller, is to bring history to life. This is most affecting when he returns to the grand villa in Taormina where he and other officers had a short break from war, and partied accordingly. Though the levity of the moment is punctured by an aside from a local historian (\"very useful at the time\", he replies when Whicker mentions finding pornography in the house's library), it remains the heart of the film: 60 years on, he is the only one of his group still alive. \"That's the saddest thing of all,\" he says, losing his dapper, debonair demeanour and looking older and crumpled just for a second, \"there's no one to tell it to.\" </p> <p>The irritations stem from this being a very personal film, and one not troubled by being fair or right on. The Italians are regarded as lazy buffoons, and women are marginal figures, pretty and sexualised. There is a bizarre sequence of lovely ladies sipping cold drinks in a cafe in the modern film, and only scant reference to them in the archive. \"Hungry women,\" Whicker notes dodgily at one point, \"offering themselves for a packet of biscuits.\" He is not, unsurprisingly, a man short of ego (\"this is where I invaded Europe,\" he says over a shot of another gorgeous beach), but the film's touching switch between archive and memory, official version and partisan account, nudges you to let him off. </p> <p>The drama of flashback sustains <strong>Without a Trace</strong> (Channel 4) too. It's a rather silly, though very sleek, missing persons police drama, with some of the most fidgety opening credits to date. It's all about as subtle as The Da Vinci Code, and you get a sugar rush from watching scenes in which people actually do say such things as: \"If we don't find this guy in a hurry, he may never get another chance.\" In last night's episode, Samantha Spade (Poppy Montgomery) was deemed trigger-happy and was taken off full FBI duties after shooting two armed suspects, not long after she herself had been shot. She looks so startlingly like Britney Spears, I kept waiting for her to say: \"Oops, I did it again.\" Instead, disappointingly, she kept repeating \"I'm fine \", with a worryingly wild look about her. </p> <p>In <strong>EastEnders</strong> (BBC1), Dot keeps doing little looks to herself when she has been nasty to Jim, who doesn't know that she has cancer. To make up for one outburst, she takes him for a curry. Only in Walford, where nobody smiles unless they're deep in gangland violence or incest, could the flourishing curry house be called The Argee Bharjee.</p>",
  "<p>David Calcutt, who has died following Parkinson's disease aged 73, is best remembered for his work as chairman of two far-reaching inquiries into the workings of the press. </p> <p>In 1989 he was appointed chairman of the Committee on Privacy and Related Matters. It followed MPs' calls for curbs and a comment by David Mellor that journalists were \"drinking in the Last Chance Saloon\". </p> <p>The next year, Calcutt recommended a Press Complaints Commission to replace the Press Council. If self-regulation did not work, then he recommended a statutory body be created. Nearly 15 years later Calcutt was still being referred to as the keeper of that saloon. </p> <p>His 1993 Review of Press Self Regulation reiterated the potential need for a statutory press tribunal, as well as sterner laws to protect privacy. </p> <p>The latter was not a measure that appealed to the Conservative government of the time. When, that year, pictures of Princess Diana leaving a gymnasium caused another furore, bringing suggestions that after all there might be a press ombudsman, Calcutt was an outsider for such an appointment, but nothing came of it. </p> <p>Born in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where his father ran a chemist's shop, he was an only child. He became a chorister at Christ Church, Oxford, and after becoming a music scholar at Cranleigh, of which he was later chairman of the school board, he won a choral scholarship to King's College, Cambridge. </p> <p>There he read not only law but music. He was a Harmsworth law scholar when called to the bar in 1955, joining Middle Temple and the Western Circuit. He supplemented his earnings by working for the Times law reports, of which he later became editor. </p> <p>By the early 1960s, he was regularly in the court of appeal and the divisional court. In 1969, he successfully appeared in a then rare case of a man convicted of murder when the court of appeal admitted evidence to show the original pathologist might have erred. </p> <p>Always maintaining his love of music, in 1970 he failed to convince the court that the revenue commissioners were wrong in claiming purchase tax from an invention known as the Stylophone. He argued that it was a keyboard instrument and so exempt. The court found it was not. </p> <p>In 1973, he prosecuted Maureen Bingham, the wife of the naval officer who had passed secrets to the Russians. </p> <p>She received two-and-a-half years and Calcutt, in the court of appeal, successfully argued that contacting a member of the Soviet Embassy was a sufficient preliminary step in the venture to justify her conviction. </p> <p>In 1981, in one of his now relatively rare ventures into the criminal courts, he appeared for the crown in a case where a German was charged with the murder of his wife. Her body had not been identified for five years. In the event the man was acquitted. </p> <p>Calcutt took silk in 1972, and was head of chambers which he ruled in, some said, a benevolent dictatorship from 1976 to 1988. </p> <p>He had become deputy chairman of Somerset quarter sessions in 1970 and now became a recorder of the crown court. He was chairman of the bar in 1984, often the final step to an appointment to the high court bench. </p> <p>Instead, he became master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he had been teaching law in the 1970s. </p> <p>Initially it was not a wholly welcome appointment, and there were complaints that it had been undemocratic. There were calls for Calcutt to withdraw, but as the years passed it became clear what a successful appointment it had been. </p> <p>He had married Barbara Walker, a psychiatric social worker, in 1969 at a service with the choirs of Edington Priory, Wiltshire, where he had founded a music festival. </p> <p>She became almost as popular in the college as him. Calcutt ensured women were admitted as undergraduates. In turn, she sported the college colours. </p> <p>From 1974 to 1977, Calcutt had been an inspector for the Department of Trade into the Cornhill Consolidated property crash, and over the next 20 years he headed numerous inquiry boards. He was chairman of the takeover panel, and also the home secretary's independent assessor on compensation for miscarriages of justice, awarding nearly \u00a31m to Paddy Hill of the Birmingham Six and \u00a330,000 to Colin Wallace, wrongly convicted of killing his friend in a long-running cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in which Wallace was championed by Paul Foot. </p> <p>Calcutt was regarded as generous in his compensation awards, but he pleased neither the public nor Winston Silcott, whom he awarded \u00a310,000 for the time he was wrongly in custody awaiting trial. </p> <p>Calcutt did explain his assessments - a policy not adopted by his successor. At one end of the scale, he dealt with cases for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. </p> <p>At the other, he headed the inquiry into the Falklands Island Commission of Inquiry into a hospital fire in 1984. </p> <p>Calcutt was chancellor of the dioceses of Exeter and Bristol from 1971 and in Europe from 1983. Possessed of a fine bass voice, he retained an interest in church music as well as the preservation of the countryside. </p> <p>Knighted in 1991, he could genuinely be described, in the best meaning of the phrase, as a public servant. His friends ascribed the volume of work he undertook to his ability to get straight through to the core of the problem and by having as clear a mind as he did a desk.</p> <p>His wife survives him; they had no children. </p> <p>\u00b7 David Charles Calcutt, barrister, born November 2 1930; died August 11 2004.</p>",
  "<p>The founders of the Beijing Youth Daily would not have believed it, but their paper - the mouthpiece of the Communist youth league - is about to be the first Chinese newspaper to be listed on an international stock market. </p> <p>As part of a government plan to reconcile domestic propaganda with global capitalist profit, China's second biggest daily says it will issue shares on the Hong Kong bourse to finance a modernisation and expansion programme. </p> <p>Reflecting the political sensitivities of this latest step towards opening up one of China's last closed markets, the newspaper has declined to reveal when the offering will be made or how much it will be worth. </p> <p>The flotation is being planned to ensure that management and editorial control remain with the authorities, who are struggling to accept that the media can be an independent public watchdog rather than a public relations tool. </p> <p>According to local reports, investors will be offered only a quarter of the company, putting the float's value at about \u00a3200m. Other restrictions are likely to ensure the government maintains control. </p> <p>It has been 25 years since Deng Xiaoping's opening-up policy began to transform other sectors of the economy, but party and government organs still own and - at least nominally - control every one of the country's 2,137 newspapers. When the propaganda ministry issues a list of stories that should not appear in print, editors stifle their instincts to inform. </p> <p>But this political grip is being weakened as the media market expands, becomes more profit-oriented and obliged to open up to foreign competition in advertising and distribution as part of China's commitment to the World Trade Organisation. </p> <p>Reformers inside the Communist party and academia are also pushing for change. They argue that a stronger media sector is necessary to counter the growing problem of corruption, and to ensure the healthy development of a rapidly transforming nation. </p> <p>\"A major change is necessary,\" said Yu Guoming, deputy director of the school of journalism at Beijing People's University. \"In the past, the public were often kept in the dark, but as society changes it is essential that information is provided in a timely and objective manner so that people feel secure.\" </p> <p>In many areas, change is already apparent. The media market has expanded rapidly since 1978, when China had 186 registered newspapers. According to a survey by the Interfax news agency, there are now 12 times as many titles generating 76 times more income. </p> <p>While competition is still limited - no newspaper is allowed to go bankrupt - rivalry for circulation and advertising has increased after reforms to make publications more financially self-sufficient. </p> <p>Last year, the government banned the practice of work units and other bodies being forced to subscribe to party and administrative organs such as Taxation News. </p> <p>It also targeted 2,000 heavily subsidised papers and journals for closure and barred public officials from joining the management of media bodies. </p> <p>\"Changes in the media reflect changes in society,\" said He Li, editor-in-chief of the Economic Observer. \"Competition gets fiercer every year. But, compared to the car or mobile phone market, it is still not enough.\" </p> <p>His is one of a handful of publications to have bent the rules to secure a degree of financial and editorial independence that would have been unimaginable five years ago. </p> <p>Although most of its staff and offices are in Beijing, the magazine is privately funded and registered as an organ of a provincial office sufficiently distant - politically and geographically - to allow the paper leeway in its coverage of businesses in the capital, Shanghai and Guangdong. </p> <p>A similarly managed publication that has won plaudits for brave journalism and sound management is Caijing. Its editor, Hu Shuli, won the World Press Review's editor of the year award last year for stories on the Sars crisis and corruption. </p> <p>Hu said the outside world's view of Chinese journalism was 30 years out of date. \"Media supervision is not as tight as it was. We are treated as businesses. </p> <p>Our values are increasingly close to those of the global media,\" she noted. \"Ethics are related to money. Without financial independence, there can be no ethics.\" </p> <p>The media are still far more closed to foreigners than other areas of society but in politically non-sensitive areas, such as fashion and IT, overseas publishers have hooked up with local partners. </p> <p>To get around restrictions, some set themselves up as advisers but play an influential role in design, editorial policy and business management. According to Global China Media Consulting, eight of the 10 most popular magazines have some foreign content. </p> <p>With annual growth of 12-25% forecast, China's media market is attracting the attention of global tycoons. Rupert Murdoch, whose Star TV is accessible in China by satellite, has given a lecture to the Communist party school in Beijing. </p> <p>So far, the only outsiders who have been allowed to invest in Chinese media groups are from Hong Kong. Last month, Tom.com, a Hong Kong-based internet publisher, caused waves by buying a 49% stake in Popular Computer Weekly, the mainland's most popular IT publication. But this HK$196.9m (\u00a313.7m) investment brought control of advertising and distribution - not editorial content. </p> <p>Further openings are likely to come gradually. The Communist party is expected to announce reforms this autumn that will designate media organisations as private companies rather than public bodies. </p> <p>Such reforms are partly motivated by a desire to strengthen China's mainly small, regional news groups to meet competition from overseas. Liu Binjie, deputy director of the state administration of press and publications, predicts that China will have its own national media groups within a few years. </p> <p>But officials have made clear that the primary principle will be to leave the media under the control of the party. Editors who forget are ruthlessly put in their place. T</p> <p>his year, three senior journalists of the Southern Metropolitan Daily were arrested. The charge was embezzling state funds, but few doubt that they were punished for unauthorised revelations about Sars, police brutality and corruption.</p>",
  "<p>Until yesterday afternoon, Boscastle was best known for its Elizabethan harbour, clifftop walks and romantic links with Thomas Hardy. Then the rains came. </p> <p>With them they brought the flash flood which swept away buildings and cars and left the picturesque fishing village in north Cornwall plunged into mayhem - waist deep in water, with people clambering on to the safety of roofs. </p> <p>The tourists who flock to the village each year to immerse themselves in the area's Arthurian legends and to visit St Juliot's church, which brought Hardy and his wife together and which he immortalised in A Pair of Blue Eyes, found themselves immersed instead in water. </p> <p>It did not take long for Boscastle, which stands in a deep coomb where two valleys meet, to feel the consequences when the three rivers - the Valency, Jordan and Paradise - that flow through it burst their banks. </p> <p>Georgia Gifkans, a 14-year-old from Stevenage, escaped the resultant deluge when she was winched off the roof of her bed and breakfast. \"I was in the B&amp;B watching all the water come down, then all these cars started to float past,\" she said. </p> <p>\"All the shop windows started smashing, and my father and I got on to the roof of the Riverside Hotel. We were airlifted to safety by a helicopter. </p> <p>\"It lasted for about an hour, and the water was coming up to the waist of grown men. It was going so fast it was frightening. I have never seen anything like it.\" </p> <p>The area was full of holidaymakers who had travelled to Cornwall at the height of the season. Arthur Mason and his wife, Julie, from Denton in Manchester had been on a caravan holiday in Bude, further up the coast, when they decided to visit Boscastle. </p> <p>\"We were just going up the street trying to get back to the car park from the bottom of the village,\" said Mr Mason. </p> <p>\"The water came up very, very quickly,\" added his wife. \"At first it was just a couple of inches, Then we were up to our knees. The wall of the car park went and we shot into a house and up the stairs. </p> <p>\"We were stuck there for a while, then we climbed out of the attic window which was part of the roof and were airlifted off by the RAF. </p> <p><strong> Terrified</strong><br> </p> <p> \"We were absolutely terrified. When we were watching from the house window we saw cars, trees and everything just floating down the road, it was terrifying.\" </p> <p>Other tourists described the speed with which the narrow streets of the village had become submerged. </p> <p>\"I have never seen anything like it,\" said Wayne Grundy, who was staying in Boscastle with his girlfriend. </p> <p>\"The rain came down and turned the roads into rivers. Cars started coming down the high street and then out to sea. I saw a caravan and two cars washed over the top of a bridge.\" </p> <p>Mr Grundy said he saw people climbing into windows to escape the rising water. </p> <p>\"The bed and breakfast and tea shop just filled with water. One minute they were ankle deep and the next they were up to their chests trying to climb into windows to escape the wash.\" </p> <p>Mark Latham, 15, was at work in the Harbour restaurant when the downpour began. Within minutes it had swamped businesses along the harbour front. </p> <p>He and other staff raced to the first floor of the restaurant and then on to high ground above the harbour as a 3-metre wall of floodwater struck, bringing bits and pieces of the village with it. </p> <p>\"There were all sorts of things being swept along - cars, statues, benches, signs. We thought it was coming straight for us at one point, but the waters turned and went out to sea,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Most of the businesses along the harbour front have been ripped apart. It started raining and we thought it would stop, but it just kept on and the river started rising. </p> <p>\"The car park at the top of the village had two cars left in it and this time of year it is normally packed. The others had been just swept away. It was very frightening.\" </p> <p>Ron Muffett, who runs the Napoleon Inn at the top of the village, was waiting anxiously for news of his wife, Sharon, and their 13-year-old daughter, Julie, who were both trapped in their house. </p> <p>Word eventually reached him and his nine-year-old son, Lee, that they were safe and were due to be airlifted by rescue helicopter. Their house is near the village car park, which took the initial brunt of the floodwater after the river burst its banks. </p> <p>\"The scene here is one of sheer devastation and my wife is still trapped down there,\" said Mr Muffett, 57. \"Both bridges in the village have just been swept away. </p> <p>\"When the river burst its banks it took the visitor centre and toilet block. They have both gone. The firemen are cutting off roofs to get people out.\" </p> <p>His mother-in-law, Glenys Dallow, was also caught in the flood. She runs a trinket shop called Cornish Goodies on the harbour front, but she and her staff managed to escape before the rising water flooded the buildings. </p> <p>\"We don't know how much damage there is yet as you just can't get down there,\" said Mr Muffett. </p> <p><strong> Torn apart</strong><br> </p> <p> When the waters began to subside in the early evening, Boscastle residents emerged to find their pavements ripped up and their gardens torn apart. </p> <p>But it was at the bottom of the village near the harbour where the devastation was most spectacular; there a huge section of the road leading across a river bridge was being ripped away by the water, which was still running fiercely last night. </p> <p>Uprooted trees were piled up to 9 metres high against houses and strewn across the road. Shops which took the full force of the water had their window glass ripped out and last night were still under water. The end of one building near the harbour had been completely swept away by the force of the water. </p> <p>Outside a row of cottages just feet from the river's edge two or three cars had been tossed against the side of the walls and one of them was upside down. </p> <p>Superintendent Jon Wotton said the emergency services had evacuated the people most in need and would later decide how to carry out a sweep through the flood-affected area to check whether it was safe to return and whether some buildings still posed a threat. Two buildings near the Wellington pub were said to have collapsed earlier. </p> <p>He promised that the operation would carry on all night and said there were more than 150 members of the emergency services on the scene. </p> <p>The local MP, Paul Tyler, was among those caught in the flooding. </p> <p>\"I have never seen it rain so hard as this,\" he said. \"Obviously we all hope that there have been no serious injuries.\" </p> <p>He paid tribute to the work done by the emergency services and said he would be calling for emergency funds to help pay for the flood damage. </p> <p>There were similar scenes four miles away in Camelford, where a spokeswoman for Camel Taxis said her drivers had reported seeing water more than a metre deep \"running like rivers\". </p> <p>Nigel Doyle, the landlord of the Darlington Inn in Camelford, said people were stacking sandbags to protect their properties from the swollen river Camel.</p>",
  "<p>Nine months after the death of its presiding genius Jed Williams, the Brecon jazz festival celebrated its 21st birthday in the manner he loved - streets teeming with fans and bands, music on every space from a patch of grass to a theatre. </p> <p>The biggest, though perhaps unjazziest, star was Amy Winehouse - who was soulfully eloquent in front of a punchy horn section on Saturday. The same night, trumpeter Randy Brecker had everybody from teenagers to pensioners leaping to his mix of hard postbop and vintage Brecker Brothers backbeat jazz. </p> <p>More demure music on Saturday came from the young, vocally-formidable US retro singer Jane Monheit - who eerily recalls Vera Lynn as much as Ella Fitzgerald, and whose vampy body language suggests she's performing to a mirror rather than an audience. Monheit briefly duetted with Brazilian singer/guitarist Dori Caymmi, Jo\u00e3o Gilberto's son. Caymmi's private, murmuring singing style and lateral arrangements of standards was, with Monheit and elsewhere, a quirky festival highlight. </p> <p>The Welsh Jazz Composers' Orchestra, presenting originals by pianist/accordionist Huw Warren, bassist Paula Gardiner and others, was particularly imposing for operatically bluesy singer Li Harding and the gifted Warren's piano-playing and mix of swinging drive and slashes of bold colour. </p> <p>Veteran trumpeter Kenny Wheeler later reworked his vividly mournful songs through inspired performances by himself and guitarists John Abercrombie and John Parricelli, with bassist Chris Laurence. Veteran Scottish saxophonist Bobby Wellins was also at his slyly-paced best on Sunday. And Wellins's younger sax-playing countryman Tommy Smith unfolded the delicate arts of tone control, while his bassist Aidan O'Donnell showed why Smith calls him \"the Scottish Dave Holland\".</p>",
  "British travellers who overstay in the US by a few days will no longer be searched, handcuffed, detained and put on the first plane back home if they return, the commissioner of the American department of homeland security said. <p>Stories of the harsh treatment meted out to British visitors who stayed beyond the 90 days allowed without a visa had given a \"black eye\" to America's reputation, said Robert Bonner, who heads the department's customs and border protection bureau. </p> <p>\"The consequences were grossly disproportionate to the minor, technical violations,\" he told the New York Times. \"Typically these individuals were handcuffed during the time they were transported to and from detention. They were treated as criminals.\" </p> <p>British visitors to the US, like those from 26 other states including Germany and Japan, can visit the US for 90 days without a visa. In the past when those who had stayed longer than that tried to re-enter the country they were handcuffed, locked up, often overnight, and then sent back. </p> <p>While the decision affects all 27 countries it appears that news reports in Britain prompted the change as the US believed it was tarnishing its image abroad. </p> <p>Mr Bonner said: \"If the person doesn't pose any threat to us whatsoever we want to find a way to let that person in. We can make judgments and exercise discretion to do something other than deny entry for minor technical violations of the immigration law and still do our priority mission, and that is preventing terrorists from entering the US.\" </p> <p>The new policy means previous transgressors will be permitted to enter the country for 90 days despite their history, but have to apply for visas after that. </p> <p>Officials do not know how many people were detained under the previous policy but conceded it was a significant number. </p> <p>Earlier this year a British man told of the harsh conditions he was held in after customs officials at New York's Kennedy airport detained him on suspicion of defaulting on a debt in the Middle East. </p> <p>David Pattison, 52, of Beeston in Norfolk, said he was subjected to \"inhumane and degrading\" treatment as he was detained with eight others, including two Britons. </p> <p>The accountant said he was handcuffed and a restraint was placed across his chest by abusive guards. He claimed he was denied food or drink and his angina medication was taken away from him. He denied that he owed money in the Gulf state of Qatar. </p> <p>In another case Magnus Mulliner, the deputy head of sports and recreation at a college in Southampton, said he was refused entry to the US at JFK in 2002 after immigration officials told him his name was linked to narcotics offences, which he denied. </p> <p>British embassy officials in Washington yesterday welcomed the move, saying they hoped the decision would \"result in a decline in the number of British citizens detained on arrival\".</p>",
  "<p>Holidaymakers hoping to catch British Airways flights at Heathrow airport faced long queues and delays yesterday after one in 10 of the airline's check-in staff called in sick. </p> <p>Absenteeism surged to triple the usual rate in a sign of militancy during a pay dispute which could cause a near total shutdown of the airline in an official strike over the August bank holiday weekend.</p> <p>BA's check-in, baggage handling and terminal staff are unhappy with an inflation-linked pay offer worth 8.5% over three years, or 10.5% if they give up pension contributions. They want 14.5%.</p> <p>The airline said yesterday its flights were being delayed by an average of 30 minutes, although departure boards showed some were running three hours late.</p> <p>One BA source at Heathrow said: \"The strike is on, in effect, without it being declared.\"</p> <p>The GMB union, which voted narrowly for an official strike last week, confirmed that it intends to hold a 24-hour stoppage covering BA staff at nine airports, including Heathrow, Manchester, Birmingham and Gatwick, over the August bank holiday weekend.</p> <p>The union's national organiser, Allan Black, said a stoppage beginning at 4.30am could occur on August 27, 28, 29 or 30. He said the union was \"preparing for war but hoping for peace\".</p> <p>Mr Black blamed BA for the timing, saying the airline had been dragging its heels since negotiations began in January. \"We have no interest in closing down British Airways and do not want to see the public inconvenienced.

  "<p>Struggling supermarket group J Sainsbury has almost doubled the size of its convenience store operation with a \u00a3100m deal. </p> <p>The group is buying the 114-strong Jacksons chain of neighbourhood stores, which stretch across Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and the north Midlands. The acquisition will take the number of Sainsbury's convenience outlets to 235. The supermarket group also operates 22 forecourt stores at Shell filling stations. </p> <p>Britain's 55,000 convenience stores are experiencing rapid growth - sales climbed more than 7% last year - and the big supermarket chains, including Tesco and the Co-Op, have poured millions into buying stores. Shoppers are spending more on \"top up\" shops between weekly or monthly visits to superstores. At the same time, the supermarket groups, which rarely win planning permission for new out-of-town stores, have turned to neighbourhood stores and high streets for growth. </p> <p>Tesco has made the biggest strides, buying hundreds of former T&amp;S outlets and converting them to the Tesco Express format. It will have 500 Express outlets by the spring and keep 450 former T&amp;S outlets under the One Stop fascia. It has 6% of the \u00a323bn market. The purchase of Jacksons will take Sainsbury's share to about 2%. </p> <p>Jacksons Stores, founded in 1991 and based in Melton on the outskirts of Hull, was part of the privately owned William Jackson &amp; Son business. WJS was founded in 1851 and is chaired by fifth-generation family member Christopher Oughtred. Twenty family shareholders control 80% of the business and will receive about \u00a380m from the deal. </p> <p>WJS has other interests, including Tryton Foods, which produces frozen yorkshire puddings under the Aunt Bessie's brand, and Kwoks, which specialises in heat-and-eat Thai and Chinese foods for supermarkets. </p> <p>The group includes a bakery business and has shipping and insurance interests. </p> <p>Angus Oughtred, 47, managing director of the convenience stores operation, will join Sainsbury's along with 2,350 staff. </p> <p>Jacksons will continue to be run autonomously, with its own supply chain, warehouse and distribution facilities, but with Sainsbury's acting as supplier. </p> <p>The business has net assets of \u00a325.5m and last year's turnover was \u00a3143m. Sainsbury's said the acquisition would be earnings-enhancing in the first year and the shares climbed 0.75p to close at 257.75p. </p> <p>The stores will be rebranded \"Sainsbury's at Jacksons\", which Sainsbury's says has been successful at the 54 Bells stores acquired this year for about \u00a320m. The group also has 67 outlets branded as \"Sainsbury's Local\". </p> <p>Chief executive Justin King said Sainsbury's now employed three of the most respected convenience store entrepreneurs - Steven Bell, Mr Oughtred and Jim McCarthy, who joined from T&amp;S as managing director of Sainsbury's convenience operations. </p> <p>\"I think they will make a great team to develop our convenience offer for shoppers,\" said Mr King. \"Shareholders will benefit too as we create real scale and expertise in this sector.\"</p>",
  "<p>The sun is shining, students have disappeared and universities are enduring the worst time of the year, when tempers fray and passions rise. Yes, the annual outbreak of \"room wars\".</p> <p>The first law of accommodation states that there will never be enough rooms to satisfy the territorial ambitions of an average dean (not that any dean can ever be described as average). If a set of rooms become available, the odd dean can be spotted corridor-creeping in the hope that mere proximity to empty rooms will ensure ultimate control. Such lurking is the academic equivalent of \"marking territory\" by animals. They are like cats, rubbing their cheeks against the doorjamb, hoping to establish ownership.</p> <p>Ownership and control of rooms is only half the problem. After the ravages of academic life have taken their toll, rooms start to look tatty and in need of cleaning up. This brings to the fore the second law of accommodation. The cost of any refurbishment always exceeds the first estimate by a factor of 10. On the rare occasions when anyone asks me about cleaning up a particular lecture theatre, I cheerfully suggest a couple of coats of magnolia for \u00a3100. Next thing you know \u00a3100,000 has evaporated as the rooms are completely gutted and rebuilt. Unbelievable! All because there was a bit of asbestos!</p> <p>There is a secret way in which you can slowly, but carefully, refurbish an entire university for absolutely nothing. The clue has to be to ask yourself, \"Where are the best rooms in the university?\" All of you who have suggested the vice-chancellor's office are irredeemably cynical and wrong. The best rooms in the university are, of course, in the estates department. The windows open smoothly, the thermostatic valves on the radiators have not been stolen, the paintwork is clean. And rightly so. A tatty estates department is like a plastic surgeon with a pimple on his nose: not likely to inspire confidence.</p> <p>So here's the plan.</p> <p>Stage one: grab the director of estates and announce, preferably with a mournful expression, that you are going to have to move an academic department into the rooms occupied by estates, and estates will have to be relocated to the small dungeon immediately behind the refuse compactors.</p> <p>Stage two: after a couple of days estates will reappear with a tame architect, quantity surveyor, M&amp;E engineer and all the usual hangers-on in tow and happily announce that it can adapt its new area to a reasonable standard but it will cost about a grillion pounds. With another mournful expression you regretfully inform them that the adaptations budget is fully committed for the next 10 years, so they will just have to improvise. After all, they must have a few bricks and a bit of plastic sheeting left over from other jobs.</p> <p>Stage three: a miracle happens. Building materials start to appear from the farthest corners of the university and head for the site of the new estates department. A pair of Corinthian columns left over from the refurbishment of the school of art; a piece of Axminster suspiciously labelled \"off-cut\" but still the size of a small football pitch. Like foraging ants that carry leaves 10 times their own weight on their backs, trophies are collected by the estates department for their new accommodation.</p> <p>Stage four: after a month, on time and with no budget, the new accommodation for the estates department is finished. Estates is now happily installed in a wonderful cathedral-like structure adapted entirely through ingenuity and imagination. The director of estates has a modest office, though the new stained-glass window that has magically appeared gives it a dignity and ambience that most university accommodation is sadly lacking. All this is at zero cost, yet built to a standard that gets it nominated for at least a regional prize from the Royal Institute of British Architects.</p> <p>Stage five: move them again next year and get a free refurbishment of another tatty area of the university.</p> <p>If only this rule applied to other departments of the university. Then you could move the finance department and they'd make money. Not much chance of that working.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Peter Knight is vice chancellor of the University of Central England (and doesn't intend to move)</p>",
  "<p>Exam boards are mysterious institutions. Shrouded in acronyms, they emerge for their brief moment in the limelight every August: this week for A-levels, next week GCSEs. All being well, they then disappear from the media to quietly get on with their business.</p> <p>This Thursday, when A-level results come out - and next week, when it's time for GCSEs - the boards, their regulator, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, and the government, have one thing in common for the exam candidates. After 55,000 markers have marked the 26m individual scripts and coursework submissions that make up six million GCSEs, one million AS levels and 780,000 A-levels, all they can do is keep their fingers crossed and hope. </p> <p>If everything goes smoothly, as they insist it will, their efforts will be taken for granted. But if anything goes wrong, the boards will be in the news for the wrong reasons. Memories of 2002 still prey on the minds of the boards, when a row over late changes to grade boundaries in the first year of the new A-level curriculum plunged the exam system into the biggest crisis in its history. The furore led to an emergency inquiry by Mike Tomlinson, which recommended a host of reforms; the sacking of Sir William Stubbs, then chairman of the QCA; and started a train of events that partly contributed to the later resignation of the education secretary, Estelle Morris.</p> <p>Though Ken Boston, the chief executive of the QCA, who arrived from Australia to take up his post in the middle of the row, believes the British exam system is the most respected in the world, he has been busy dragging what he has described as a \"19th-century cottage industry\" kicking and screaming into the 21st century.</p> <p>The big three exam boards - Edexcel, the Assessment and Qualification Alliance, and OCR, the Oxford, Cambridge and RSA board - have been dipping their toes in the waters of modernisation to see what they can do to improve their systems. Edexcel has been the first to undertake widespread piloting of online marking, under the auspices of its new bosses, Pearson Education, an arm of Pearson, the media and publishing giant, which took it over last year. The QCA itself has undergone a restructuring. Its board is almost entirely changed since the crisis. Mike Tomlinson, the ex-Ofsted boss, has joined, but so, too, have a number of industrialists and business experts, under a new chairman, Sir Anthony Greener, former head of the drinks group Diageo. Now some argue that the increased modernisation, professionalisation and commercialisation are bringing new problems of their own.</p> <p>Already this summer, albeit over a less high-profile series of exams, the system has been questioned by a cock-up that infuriated teachers and the army of part-time markers. Last week the Department for Education and Skills announced it would not be publishing the results of the English Sats for 14-year-olds next week as planned because the results had not been judged \"fit for purpose\".</p> <p>The blame game is still being played out, but inquiries by Education Guardian have established the fullest picture yet of what went wrong.</p> <p>The National Assessment Agency (NAA), the new arm of the QCA that administers Sats, decided to have two people marking each paper: one would do the reading, the other the writing. They believed that with individuals concentrating on a specialist area, marking would be more accurate.</p> <p>But things started to go wrong. Some 627,000 results were due in schools on July 13 and most didn't show up. By July 20, and the end of term, 170 schools still hadn't received their results. The NAA issued a \"profuse\" apology for the tardiness, but it was rapidly becoming apparent that many of the results were not only late, but wrong. They were \"haywire\", according to the Secondary Heads Association.</p> <p>What happened between those good intentions, and the \"haywire\" results is contested.</p> <p>Some 2,500 markers were employed by the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA), the board for key stage 3 Sats. Several markers have spoken to Education Guardian over the weeks since the crisis and all of them claim the marking process went well. Some markers completed their allocation a week ahead of the deadline and asked for more. They filled out their mark forms and sent them off to a data collection company, Data Collection Services, owned by Pearson, which had been contracted by the QCA to collate the two results and disseminate them to schools. The markers were then given access to a special website where they could check their students' final results and recheck any \"borderline\" cases that were flagged up. This \"data-capture\" phase, say the markers, was the problem.</p> <p>As the deadline drew near, some markers could not log on to the website. Other markers trying to double-check their borderline results couldn't do so, or found the results hadn't yet been input.</p> <p>Schools also had access to the site to get results. Some were stunned by what they found. Whole year groups were failed. In other cases, schools found the marks given seemed to depend on alphabetical order of students' surnames - names in the A-L category would get one grade, and M-Z another.</p> <p>When some requested the papers, they found them marked correctly. But the marks were wrong on the system. \"How they managed to screw it up so hugely is stunning\", one marker from a Brighton school told Education Guardian.</p> <p>Chris Keates, acting general secretary of NASUWT, blamed the private contractors. \"Even the slightest lapse by schools in the conduct of examinations is subject to intense scrutiny. It is about time the same standards were applied to these organisations,\" she said.</p> <p>Pearson insists it hit all deadlines and the missing results were down to the fact that it hadn't been provided by the markers. If it was tempting to point the finger at Pearson, others spread the blame more widely. During the second week of July, the NAA saw a crisis looming and made an astonishing decision. It abandoned the double-checking of borderline results. It appears that it traded off the cast-iron guarantee of quality in a bid to meet the deadline.</p> <p>As the summer term drew to a close, Martin Ward, deputy general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, decided to survey his members about the problem. He emailed 2,000 schools, immediately prompting 150 replies, most complaining about the accuracy of results, rather than delays in their delivery. \"The tone of the messages varies from angry to anguished to weary,\" he says. The NAA is now organising the re-marking of those papers. Headteachers have been advised to return strange-looking results to the AQA's Guildford and Newcastle marking centres.</p> <p>The QCA refuses to say how many queries it has received, or how many papers are being looked at again. It maintains there is no widespread remarking. However, it has written to all schools about the problems.</p> <p>But Pearson's involvement in Sats marking is about to be extended. Pearson and Edexcel are the preferred bidders for the \u00a327m contract for the marking and data-collection of Sats.</p> <p>The Pearson takeover of Edexcel nearly a year ago came as something of a shock to board members at the QCA. Exam boards have traditionally been registered as charities and have ploughed the bulk of their profits back into the examining process. Pearson has made inroads into a market which it believes has been too amateurish. Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of Pearson, told a Lehman Brothers European media seminar in September 2002: \"The UK is highly inefficient in marking exams. They spend three times as much per student on exams as American schools do, and they spend a third as much on educational materials as American schools do. So they could really use some efficiencies in marking GCSEs. Even if you didn't add technology you could do a lot better, and we think that's good potential.\"</p> <p>Part of Pearson's grand plan is to globalise the marking process. Pearson markers in Iowa and Sydney marked short questions in some GCSEs and GNVQs this year. Edexcel said it allowed them, because of the time difference, to do 24-hour marking. For one week, markers of traditional exams were asked to ring a number that diverted to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where data-inputters took the marks and entered them on the system.</p> <p>Defending the decision to allow Pearson to take over Edexcel, Ken Boston told Education Guardian earlier this year: \"I see no reason why we should blanch at private-sector companies where they can provide the best service at the cheapest price winning a bid under open competition. That's not to say we would ever want to see monopolies.\"</p> <p>Others remember with a shudder the closing remarks of Sir Anthony Greener, chairman of the QCA, at a drinks party for QCA and DfES staff last year: \"We've always got to remember we're serving the children of UK plc.\"</p> <p>Martin Ward says Pearson's takeover \"raises questions about the status of the various examining boards. They've been part of the educational landscape for as long as anyone can remember. Most people have more or less taken them for granted. The entry of a commercial organisation into the system definitely raises questions.</p> <p>\"It has the potential for less accountability. They might be more efficient; on the other hand a private company's first duty is to its shareholders and it may be it will be less accountable to the young people who take their exams.\"</p> <p>David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, recalls AQA's decision in June to drop Latin and Greek because they weren't popular enough. If market forces apply, he says, \"I wouldn't be at all surprised if our members start saying that they've had a lousy service from the examining groups in KS3 English, how about giving us our money back?\"</p> <p>Ted Wragg, emeritus professor of education at Exeter University, says: \"What we're talking about is a seismic change from public service into profit-making business. I feel alarmed about the future, especially as the shift has never had any kind of public discussion.</p> <p>\"People want to feel that an examination board is focused on standards, not profit. How do you make that profit? More technology. This is not an argument against progress - you don't have to deliver papers in vans. But when you look at what's happening now, with scripts being sent all over the world, it's like a bad relay race with four runners and three points to drop the baton: if you're a school, who do liaise with? Schools are saying it's chaos. How do you find out what's happening? They just issue denials. It's bad enough with an exam board, but commercial ones will be worse.\"</p> <p>David Hart adds: \"I think deregulation is in theory the right way forward, but if the market is dominated and controlled by only three boards in England, and one of those is already under a great deal of strain, it doesn't take a genius to work out that in the foreseeable future we may find the number reduced even further. In the worst-case scenario, you get a monopoly.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mike Tomlinson is writing up his proposals for the reform of the 14-19 curriculum, which could also have significant effects on the assessment process. Among the options he is considering for his new diploma is a market in which boards compete for different stages of the examining process (a British Rail approach, as Wragg calls it) and a single awarding body.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether those changes would make the exam system more rational, or shed any more light on the exam boards' mysterious world. </p> <p><strong>Exam boards A-Z</strong></p> <p><strong>AQA</strong> Assessment and Qualifications Alliance</p> <p><strong>Awards</strong> 4m qualifications a year <br><strong>Annual turnover</strong> \u00a3128m <br><strong>Formed</strong> in 2000 from merger of the Associated Examining Board, North Eastern Examining Board and Joint Metriculation Board.

  "NHS patients will need three separate identity cards to demonstrate their entitlement to free care and navigate the health service, according to plans by the Department of Health published yesterday. <p>The proposals include a European health insurance card to replace the E111 form, which entitles UK residents to free or reduced-cost emergency treatment when travelling in Europe. </p> <p>A spokesman said this would be in addition to the NHS smartcard that is being developed to allow patients to book hospital appointments and access their personal \"health space\" on the internet. The space will store information about treatment preferences, next of kin and personal health records. </p> <p>The department is also keen to get patients to use a third piece of plastic - the national identity card being proposed by the home secretary, David Blunkett - as proof of entitlement to NHS services. Patients may not be able to register with a GP or get non-emergency treatment without it. </p> <p>It emerged yesterday that officials preparing the smartcard had been unaware of the UK's obligation to issue the European health insurance card by December 2005. </p> <p>Already 13 European countries have issued these cards, showing name, date of birth and identity number. Under EU law, they will hold no medical data and cannot be adapted to become NHS smartcards. </p> <p>The department said: \"In line with EU regulations the card will be issued on an individual basis. Children/wards will not be covered by a parent's/guardian's card.\"</p>"
