  "<p>Micky Adams resigned yesterday as manager of Leicester City and will be replaced, temporarily at least, by Dave Bassett, the man who took him to the club as his assistant three years ago. </p> <p>Leicester say they will not rush into appointing a long-term replacement. Among those considered possible successors is the former City striker Mike Newell, whose Luton Town team are blazing a spectacular trail in League One. </p> <p>Adams' departure was an unexpected development. His team had made a disappointing start to the season - they are 12th in the Championship, having been favourites to win it, with only one victory from six league games at home - but he enjoyed the full support of the board of directors. </p> <p>According to City's chief executive Tim Davies, they had spent the past few days trying to persuade Adams to stay on. \"It's a very sad day for the club. Micky's an honourable and decent man, whose record speaks for itself,\" said Davies. </p> <p>\"Hopefully my leaving will take the shackles off and [the players] can express themselves, gel into a good team for the new manager,\" Adams said. </p> <p>He had offered to resign after three City players were charged in connection with allegations of sexual assault while on a mid-season break at La Manga this year. All were cleared, but Adams admitted yesterday the case had taken its toll. \"I tried to put a brave front on it, kid people we could come through it unaffected, but we didn't.\" </p> <p>Coventry have signed Tottenham's midfielder Rohan Ricketts on a month's loan. </p> <p>Malcolm Glazer and his family have offered JP McManus and John Magnier 300p a share for their near 30% stake in Manchester United. At that price, the club would be valued at \u00a3786m. </p> <p>The proposal was made last Friday, according to sources close to the possible deal. The Irish investors have apparently set their minimum price at 310p, with the deal likely either to succeed or fail this week. \"With the Irish stake, there is a deal; without it there is not,\" said one City source. </p> <p>Because the Glazer family trust already owns almost 20% of United's shares, the American will effectively take control of the club if the Irishmen decide to sell. Fans' groups are hoping that the Irish will fulfil their promise to be long-term investors and wait to see if a counter-bid will emerge. Hopes appear to be pinned on the investment banker Keith Harris, who is said to be trying to build a consortium of potential investors. </p> <p>Meanwhile the fans group Shareholders United is threatening to boycott the sale of replica shirts in protest at the planned Glazer takeover. And the Conservative MPs Chris Grayling and Alistair Burt have tabled a parliamentary motion expressing concern at the possibility of the takeover. They want Glazer to \"clearly demonstrate that he would strengthen rather than weaken the club.\" </p>",
  "The omens were there from the start. The Australian cricketer Keith Miller, who has died aged 84, was born in Melbourne barely three weeks after a crowd of 105,000 had cheered as a three-year-old colt, Artilleryman, romped home by six lengths in the Melbourne Cup. Rather than scream, the infant probably asked the odds. Life was only going to be a gamble after that, and so it proved - whether as a wartime pilot, an avid follower of horseflesh, a talented Aussie Rules footballer, or as one the most charismatic, unpredictable and extrovert allrounders that cricket has seen. <p>Known as \"Nugget\", Miller was the golden boy of his country's cricket in the years immediately following the second world war. He was awarded the MBE for services to the sport, and his portrait, specially commissioned by the Marylebone Cricket Club, much to his delight, hangs in the Lord's pavilion, with those of Sir Donald Bradman and Victor Trumper, the only Australians to be so honoured. </p> <p>Latterly, he spent 20 years as a special cricket writer for the Daily Express, and then worked for Vernon's Pools, owned appropriately by the influential horseracing figure Robert Sangster. </p> <p>Miller's playing statistics are impressive enough: as a batsman, 14,183 runs at an average of 48.90 in first-class cricket, 2958 of them in 55 Tests at 36.97, including seven centuries; as a bowler, 497 wickets at 22.30, 170 in Tests at 22.97 apiece, with seven five-wicket hauls and one 10-wicket match. But they fail to convey the sheer exuberance of his game. </p> <p>When Miller was on centre stage, people took notice. On firm pitches, he could bat, right-handed, with power and panache, driving and cutting as well as any. Only in England, where his commitment to the front foot could make him look cumbersome (especially against the spin of Jim Laker, who took 46 wickets in the 1956 Ashes series) did he struggle; he averaged just 24, with a single century at Lords in 1953. </p> <p>He was capable of bowling fast, hostile spells, forming, with Ray Lindwall, a formidable new ball partnership that produced 243 wickets, a combination bettered for Australia only by Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie. At slip, where he might stand casually upright with his hands behind his back or just plonked on his thighs, he could catch swallows. </p> <p>But there was a brooding moodiness about him too. If the day did not arouse his interest, he could just as easily brush away his batting. Against Essex at Southend- on-sea in 1948, the Australians - Bradman's Invincibles - amassed 721 runs in a day, still a record. Promoted to second wicket down and with the score already 364 for two, Miller showed a distaste for the slaughter, and allowed himself to be bowled first ball by Trevor Bailey. \"Thank God that's over,\" he was heard to mutter as he marched back to the pavilion. \"He'll learn,\" was Bradman's response. </p> <p>For once, the Don was wrong: Miller was not for changing. Indeed, the pair, one a roundhead of massive influence, the other a cavalier and maverick, developed a mutual antipathy that almost certainly cost Miller any chance of captaining his country. </p> <p>He did, however, become an admired and successful, if occasionally unorthodox, captain of New South Wales. Once, on discovering that he had led an additional man on to the field at the Sydney cricket ground (SCG), his reported response was, \"One of you eff off and the rest scatter.\" The state's fifth Sheffield Shield success in nine years led to him becoming Ian Johnson's vice captain for Australia's inaugural tour of the Caribbean in 1954-55. It had been widely anticipated that he would lead the party, but Bradman's influence prevented his promotion. </p> <p>The decision hurt Miller, and while the tour was a success, the depth of feeling remained, as a rancorous incident during the fourth Test in Barbados showed. Australia having scored 668, Miller took two wickets in an over to leave West Indies at 146 for six in reply: an Australian win looked certain. But Johnson, inexplicably, removed Miller from the attack, and the ensuing stand of 347 between Denis Atkinson (219) and Clairemont Depeiza (122) remains a Test record for the seventh wicket. </p> <p>At one stage, Johnson asked Lindwall to bowl, only to be rebuffed. The captain tried to insist on his rights, but found no backing from Miller, who, in a heated exchange, said that Lindwall \"shouldn't have to bowl if he doesn't want to\". </p> <p>Later, in the dressing room, Miller told Johnson he could not captain a team of schoolboys. This so angered the captain that, before other players intervened, the pair were prepared to settle things outside with fists. The match was drawn, and although the series was won 3-0 - due, in no small part, to Miller's efforts - Johnson's stock never recovered. </p> <p>At its best, Miller's bowling could touch the heights of inspiration, capable if not of consistency then of devastating bursts, a byproduct of his unpredictability. Even today, he would be regarded as genuinely fast. This, combined with his height (he was more than 6ft, tall for a bowler in those days) and a high arm action, gave him lift from barely short of a length. If Lindwall swung the new ball massively on a pitch tinged with green, Miller used the seam to great effect, gaining movement both ways. </p> <p>There were those who considered him the most dangerous of the pair on a hot afternoon, when the ball was old and the opposition appeared in control. He was mercurial though, easily bored, with his performance often depending on how hard he had partied the previous night. But the hangover could bring with it crabbiness, so that a batsman who hung around too long could expect a barrage of bouncers, which, in turn, could draw a hostile reaction from the crowd. </p> <p>Miller would respond by standing imperiously mid-pitch, making his feelings known. Then, with a petulant toss of his black hair, he would saunter back to whichever bowling mark he decided was appropriate, and, as like as not, deliver yet another snorter past the batsman's nose, before breaking out into a wide grin. Along with Denis Compton, he became a cricketer as matin\u00e9e idol. </p> <p>Born in Sunshine, Melbourne, Victoria, Miller was named after two pilots, Sir Keith and Sir Ross Smith, engaged at the time in a historic, 27-day flight from England to Australia. At Melbourne high school, his maths and cricket master was the former Australian captain Bill Woodfull, from whom he learned so fast that in his early teens he was playing district cricket for South Melbourne. \"He was,\" his club coach Hughie Carroll recalled, \"so small that you had to be careful not to tread on him, but he seemed to gain about 10in between seasons, and became a commanding batsman.\" </p> <p>At 18, during the 1937-38 season, he made his Sheffield Shield debut for Victoria against Tasmania, scoring 181, and in 1939-40 he enhanced his reputation with a century at the Melbourne cricket ground (MCG) against a South Australian attack headed by the great legspinner Clarrie Grimmett. By the end of the 1946-47 season, he had played 18 matches for Victoria, but then economic necessity drove him to New South Wales, for which he played 50 matches until 1955-56. </p> <p>At the start of his career, he had not been seen as a potential allrounder. In district cricket, Miller had never been more than an occasional bowler but, in January 1941, playing at the MCG for Bradman's XI against McCabe's XI, he was asked to open the bowling in the second innings. He took one wicket for 24 in six overs, raising a few eyebrows with his pace and lift. It was to be the making of his career. </p> <p>During the second world war, he was a pilot with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), carrying out raids over Germany in Mosquito night-fighters. Between military duties, he played for RAAF sides in 1943 and 1944. He made his first real impact on the cricket-starved British public in the five unofficial Victory Tests of 1945. At Lord's, he scored 185 in 165 minutes for the Dominions (essentially the Australian services), including 100 in 75 minutes before lunch. </p> <p>His form for the Australian services team that toured England and India in 1945 earned him his place on the Australian tour to New Zealand. He made his Test debut at Wellington in March 1946, Australia's first postwar match, scoring 30 and taking two second-innings wickets for six runs. The following season, against England, he left no one in any doubt as to his ability, finishing the series second only to Bradman with the bat, and Lindwall with the ball. His figures included 7-60 in the first innings of the first Test at Brisbane - his best Test haul - and an unbeaten 141, at number five, in the fourth at Adelaide, his maiden Test hundred. </p> <p>It was for the flat pitches of the Caribbean eight years later that Miller saved his best batting performances. He hit his highest score of 147 in the first Test in Jamaica, following with 137 in Bridgetown in the fourth. In the fifth and final Test, again in Jamaica, he scored 109 (following bowling figures of 6-107 in the first West Indian innings), when Australia registered their highest ever total of 758 for eight. </p> <p>Miller returned to Australia to lead his state to yet another Shield triumph, their third in a row. In the match against South Australia at the SCG, he demonstrated his intuitive captaincy. He enjoyed bowling with the breeze from the Randwick end, but, on this occasion, it was missing. He threw the new ball to his fellow Test bowler Alan Davidson. However, just before the left armer delivered his first ball, Miller felt the breeze ruffle his hair; he called for the ball, marked out his own run instead and went on to take 7 for 12 as South Australia were dismissed for 27. </p> <p>Then came his last full series, the disastrous 1956 tour of England. Struggling with a back injury, and 36 years old, he managed five wickets in each innings of a win in the second Test at Lord's, but failed continuously with the bat, scoring just one half century, and that not until the final match at the Oval. </p> <p>The Australians paid brief visits to Pakistan and India on the way home, playing one Test in Karachi and one each in Bombay and Calcutta. In Karachi, Miller top scored with 21 in the first innings and made 11 in the second as Australia, beaten by nine wickets, were twice dismissed, for 80 and 187, by Fazal Mahmood, who had match figures of 13 for 114. Fazal was the medium pacer who, two years previously, had destroyed England with 12 wickets at the Oval. </p> <p>Miller took two wickets in Pakistan's first innings (including that of the great opener Hanif Mohammad for nought), and bowled 12 wicketless overs in the second. By now, however, his knee had given in to the strain. He never played Test cricket again. </p> <p>His wife Marie survives him. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Keith Ross Miller, cricketer, born November 28 1919; died October 11 2004</p>",
  "<p> The negotiations over the future of the British grand prix are expected to shift up a gear tomorrow when the sport's governing body, the FIA, publishes a draft calendar for the 2005 formula one world championship. It is expected to contain provisional dates for the Silverstone race as well as the French and San Marino grands prix. </p> <p>This will mean there are potentially 19 races being planned by Bernie Ecclestone, who holds the commercial rights to formula one, even though the teams are contracted for only 16 under the current Concorde agreement, which expires in 2007, and have to be paid a separately negotiable fee by Ecclestone for any further races. </p> <p>The teams are determined to take a firm line and make it clear that Ecclestone will have to share more of his commercial-rights income with them if they are to agree to 19 races. He is responding by positioning the three threatened traditional events in a way that may force the teams to back down if they, and their sponsors, want to keep racing at Silverstone, Imola and Magny-Cours. </p> <p>Tomorrow will not mark the last chance for Silverstone. The definitive calendar will not be published before the next FIA world council meeting in December and negotiations are expected to continue until then. Ray Bellm, the chairman of the British Racing Drivers' Club, which owns the Northamptonshire circuit, was yesterday expected to reply to Ecclestone, who sent two proposals to the club last week, neither of which it feels it can accept. </p> <p>One proposal called for a seven-year deal which, with a 10% annual escalator, would double the initial race fee from $13.5m (\u00a37.5m) to $27m (\u00a315m) over the period of the contract, leaving spectators to pay almost \u00a3400 as a basic admission fee in 2010. The other was for Ecclestone to promote the race for no fee in exchange for Silverstone effectively to be passed into his exclusive control for seven years. </p> <p>During last weekend's Japanese grand prix at Suzuka many team principals made it clear it was not acceptable to lose the British grand prix, for commercial and sporting reasons. </p> <p>\"It is my own personal feeling and personal wish that the race should happen next year,\" said David Richards, the BAR-Honda team principal. \"For us as a team and I am sure for many of the other British-based teams, the commercial impact of not having the event on all our staff is not acceptable. We need to find a solution.\" </p> <p>Paul Stoddart, the Minardi team principal, insisted: \"There will be a [British] race next year. Anyone who wants to put their money on that is on a pretty safe bet.\" </p> <p>Peter Sauber said: \"On the one hand I think 16 or 17 grands prix are enough, on the other hand Great Britain is the homeland of motorsport and I think it is important to have a British grand prix. Personally, I like the track at Silverstone.\"</p>",
  "<p>Though the fall suffered by Kieren Fallon in a nondescript race at Leicester yesterday may not have brought his challenge for the jockeys' title to an end, it may yet prove to have brought a brilliant contest to a brutal conclusion. </p> <p>Like old-time prizefighters in a bout with 100 rounds, Fallon and Frankie Dettori had been trading winners for months to set up the tightest race for the Flat jockeys' championship in recent years. It was a contest made all the more compelling by the contrasts between the two men. Dettori is the natural, born to the game as the son of a champion jockey. Fallon is the hard man from a tough background, who fought his way up on the northern circuit. Horses seem to run for Dettori because they want to. They seem to run for Fallon because they would rather not find out what will happen if they don't. </p> <p>When they arrived at Leicester yesterday to go head-to-head in six of the eight races on the card, Dettori was 10 winners clear of his great rival. By the time the gloom closed in, the Italian had ridden a treble and Fallon was on his way to Leicester Royal Infirmary. </p> <p>If yesterday's fall in a very ordinary Monday-afternoon card does not eventually prove to have decided the championship, Dettori will be as relieved as his rival. He will be abroad for a week, in the United States for the Breeders' Cup and then Australia for the Melbourne Cup, during the last days of the turf season, and was keen to build up a good lead before he departed. It was never his intention to win this title by default. </p> <p>Yet win it he now surely must, with Fallon needing to overcome medical opinion as well as his rival's 13-win lead. Dettori's re-emergence as a champion has been thoroughly deserved. He is so wholly the public face of racing, from his long spell as a team captain on A Question Of Sport to the flying dismounts captured on the back pages, that many casual sports fans probably think he is the champion jockey, and always has been. </p> <p>But it is not so, and has not been for nine long years. Dettori won his first championship in 1994, and retained the title the following season. Soon afterwards, however, he decided to concentrate on quality rather than the grinding, seven-days-a-week pursuit of winners that our very British way of deciding the title demands. </p> <p>When he almost lost his life in a plane crash in June 2001, and decided on his return to avoid light aircraft, an essential tool for most top-flight jockeys, it seemed impossible that he would ever again amass the sort of figures needed to win the championship. </p> <p>In the US they would laugh and tap their heads at our obsession with numbers. There, prize money is the deciding factor in the jockeys' titles, as it is for the trainers on this side of the water. </p> <p>Where our riders are concerned, though, money is vulgar and quantity is all. The result is that the fourth race at Leicester yesterday - the Stoat Selling Stakes, worth \u00a32,306 to the winner - is worth every bit as much in championship terms as the Derby, first prize \u00a3800,000, which Fallon won on North Light back in June. </p> <p>There is no tangible prize attached to the jockeys' title, not even an official memento to put on the sideboard. But still it matters, and matters very deeply, to the men in the weighing room. The champion jockey is the top dog in a ferociously tough and competitive pack. The swagger that comes with the title is a prize beyond price. </p> <p>And now that spring in the step, that air of first among equals, will belong to Dettori once again. He has talked in recent weeks of the months, even years, after the plane crash when his appetite for riding was intermittent, at best. And of the day when Catherine, his wife, told him to \"start being a jockey again\". </p> <p>The effect has been extraordinary. From the first days of the campaign, Dettori has been riding at even the most humdrum meetings with the flair and polish that had been evident only at the biggest events in recent years. His treble at Leicester yesterday was a perfect example, each ride different in its way but each executed with the assurance of a supreme talent at the height of his game. </p> <p>The Stoat Selling Stakes, as it happens, turned out to be one of them, and a metaphor too for the fortunes of both Dettori and Fallon. </p> <p>Fallon was quickly away on Smart Boy Prince from his outside draw in stall one, and did brilliantly to get his mount across to the lead on the inside rail. All the while, though, Dettori was stalking him on Yashin, and when he swept past two furlongs out he was going so well that you could almost imagine him letting out a snigger. </p> <p>Yashin has a reputation for lacking courage, but he went clear as he pleased by eight lengths. Dettori will now do the same to claim his third title. </p> <p>His thoughts yesterday evening will have been with his fellow jockey, undergoing a series of hospital tests. Over the season as a whole, though, the simple fact is that the most stylish and naturally gifted rider of his generation is back at the top of the pile.</p>",
  "Danielle Beccan was returning from an evening out with a large group of friends at Nottingham's medieval Goose Fair when she was shot near her home. A gold Citro\u00ebn car with blacked-out windows pulled up alongside her and her friends noticed a gun. They told her to get down on the ground, but she was too slow. At least six bullets were fired and 14-year-old Danielle was hit once in the stomach. She collapsed on the ground. <p>Her mother, Pauline Platt, who has two other young children, heard the shots, ran round the corner and found her daughter collapsed with a single bullet wound to her stomach. She died on the operating table at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham.</p> <p>Last night Nottinghamshire police said an arrest was made on Saturday. They refused to give any details, other than it was a Nottinghamshire person \"helping with their inquiries\", but officers said there might be revenge attacks.</p> <p>Superintendent David Colbeck said they had received intelligence that there might be trouble at the fair, and measures had been put in place, but the information was not specific and the measures did not include additional patrols in St Ann's, where Danielle lived and was shot.</p> <p>He added: \"We still have a long long way to go. There is still a core of individuals who believe the only way they can build their business is by using firearms.\"</p> <p>A 17-year-old local who did not want to be named said she saw the shooting. \"I was in [a nearby] street, and I heard the gunshots. I ran up here. I saw the car - a gold Citro\u00ebn with blacked-out windows.</p> <p>\"I reckoned it was case of mistaken identity, because they were with a group of boys. I reckon they were heading to get the boys but they shot the girl instead of the boys.\"</p> <p>She said she had tried to help Danielle: \"I caught her in the alleyway and tried to stop the wound from bleeding but she had internal bleeding.\"</p> <p>Another girl added: \"One of her friends saw a gun pointing out and shouted for everyone to get down but Danielle was too slow. She was dropping to the floor when she was hit in the chest and stomach. \"But she wasn't the target - they were going for one of the lads with her. She was an innocent victim.</p> <p>\"All she was doing was hanging out with her friends, which has nothing to do with this. But, as sure as night follows day, there will be reprisals.\"</p> <p>Two teenagers, Aleysha and Naomi Reid, said: \"She did not deserve to be shot. She was a black beauty; an angel. How can anyone kill an innocent 14-year-old girl? The people who did this should be locked away for ever.\"</p> <p>Yesterday red roses, lilies and gerberas lay piled on the pavement next to a blue and white teddy bear where Danielle Beccan was shot. A group of teenagers taped a tribute, in childish handwriting, to a lamp post. They paused for a moment, weeping and hugging each other.</p> <p>\"On the 9th of October every year we will sit down and celebrate the life of Danielle Becan,\" it reads. \"Who was a friend to many - but enemy to some. Thirty minutes past the hour of 12, bullets were shot and her life was stole. The heartache and pain is unbearable. How many times must a bullet fly before they're forever banned.\"</p> <p>Another card has a photocopied picture of Danielle with her hands on her hips and he message\": \"I love and miss you Dani RIP.\" Young people gathered in small groups weeping in disbelief as they examined the flowers.</p> <p>Sue Fish, Assistant Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire, called it a truly wicked and callous crime and added: \"We will do everything in our power to find the people responsible.\"</p> <p>It is the latest in a series of gun-related incidents which have plagued Nottingham, which experts fear has become infested with \"super thugs\" who command minions to do their bidding while taking millions of pounds from narcotics.</p> <p>Jamaican Yardies, many of whom repeatedly thwart deportation attempts, also have a strong foothold in the city's heroin and crack cocaine market.</p> <p>Danielle's grandfather Alvin Beccan, 69, said: \"She was just an easy going, nice girl. Her family are very cut up about it at the moment.\" Her uncle Devon visited the scene, placed a bunch of flowers and hugged two weeping women. As he drove past he said: \"We are absolutely devastated. If anyone prints that it was drugs and gang warfare they will have to face the consequences.\"</p> <p>John Bull, 61, who has lived in the area all his life, said there had been a rising tide of incidents involving drugs and guns. \"It beggars belief that a 14-year-old can be shot - it is unbelievable. There are no words to describe the animals who did this. They should be caught.\"</p> <p>Another teenager wept and said: \"I didn't get on with her, but this should never have happened. She didn't deserve it.\"</p> <p>Det Supt Colbeck said Danielle was not in a gang, but Goose Fair was traditionally a time of tension between rival groups. He said: \"I am just horrified and really angry. She's 14 - she's just a child. She's just going home with her friends from a good night out at Goose Fair.</p> <p>\"She's not part of a gang who's been shot and killed. She's innocent, for God's sake. It could have been your daughter, your son. It could have been you, just walking home. These people are evil and they need to go to prison.\"</p> <p>Nottinghamshire's chief constable, Steve Green, is a vociferous critic of liberal justice values who had described his force as being swamped by gun and drug crime. In July he opened a wider debate about the criminal justice system, saying that society's emphasis on tolerance and understanding was a \"failed\" social experiment. The evidence was on the streets, where youngsters behaved badly but knew how to play the system, he said.</p> <p>The Rev Evelyn Hall, of Mount Olive Apostolic church, said she had visited the family to offer words of consolation and prayer. \"There is so much shooting around here,\" she said. \"I think it is only God that can help with the forces of darkness and evil which surround the area.</p> <p>\"I do not think the police can do anything to help. I don't know how the family will cope.

Luv DD.\"</p>",
  "The Iraq Survey Group has finally reached its conclusions on the search for weapons of mass destruction: Iraq did not have any, having destroyed its stockpiles years before the 2003 war. During the 18-month search by more than 1,000 ISG members, North Korea reprocessed plutonium which was previously safeguarded - apparently making half a dozen nuclear weapons. Iran built gaseous centrifuges and is, reportedly, now enriching uranium. <p>Not surprisingly, Tony Blair and Australia's John Howard say the Iraq war was still worthwhile. (They could hardly say otherwise.) The US vice-president, Dick Cheney, explained that, in spite of there being no WMD, the ISG report actually justified the invasion. It showed, he told an audience last week, that \"delay, defer, wait wasn't an option\". </p> <p>It is easy to dismiss Cheney's comments as the bravado of a candidate whose ticket is sinking over the mismanagement of Iraq. He seized on a portion of the report asserting that Saddam Hussein intended to reconstitute his WMD programme once sanctions were lifted. In effect, Cheney is arguing that the US was right to attack a country that posed no threat but whose leader had evil intent and one day might try to become a threat. </p> <p>In a June 2002 speech to the US army academy at West Point, President George Bush told the graduating cadets: \"If we wait for threats to fully materialise, we will have waited too long.\" This speech articulated what became known as the pre-emption doctrine. Nine months later, the US and Britain invaded Iraq to disarm Saddam's WMD. </p> <p>Although the case for invading Iraq depended on the threat from WMD, this single explanation did not make strategic sense in 2003. With the inspections regime that was in place on the eve of the war, Iraq could not have had a nuclear weapons programme. Building WMD requires large industrial facilities that could not have been hidden from intrusive inspections. </p> <p>Thus, on the eve of the war, the conceivable threat from Iraqi WMD consisted of previously manufactured chemical weapons that could have been hidden, and some possible production of hard-to-use biological weapons in mobile laboratories. Neither constituted a serious threat to well-equipped western forces, and neither actually existed. </p> <p>But the Bush doctrine is not just about forward defence. It also involves an American mission to spread freedom and democracy, particularly in the Islamic world. This theme is part of almost every Bush foreign policy speech. The Bush doctrine constitutes an ambitious combination of forward defence and nation building. The invasion of Iraq only makes sense in this context. </p> <p>Paul Wolfowitz and the Pentagon neo-conservatives, who are the ideological authors of the Bush doctrine, saw Iraq as an opportunity to transform the Middle East. They hoped that, by overthrowing Saddam, the US could establish a democratic Iraq which would have the same ripple effect on the Islamic world that the fall of the Berlin wall had on communism. Since the American people would never buy such an ambitious (and implausible) agenda, WMD became the justification for the war, but not its reason. Wolfowitz admitted as much when he told Vanity Fair that the administration had settled on Iraqi WMD as the single rationale for war for \"bureaucratic reasons\". </p> <p>The question is whether the Bush doctrine makes for sound national security strategy. Devising this strategy entails assessing threats and looking for opportunities. Since no country can do everything, the most important task of a strategist is to set priorities, taking into account available resources, costs and risks. In his West Point speech, Bush rightly identified the most serious danger as coming \"at the crossroads of radicalism and technology\". </p> <p>But Bush never prioritised. North Korea with nuclear weapons and Iran acquiring nuclear technology posed far greater threats in 2003 than an Iraq with some hidden chemical and biological weapons. The Clinton administration threatened war to get Pyongyang to freeze its nuclear programme in 1994. In 2002, the Bush administration noisily terminated the 1994 agreement because of North Korean cheating, and then did nothing when the country withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and began reprocessing previously safeguarded plutonium into nuclear weapons. All this took place before the start of the Iraq war, but the Bush administration never shifted its focus. North Korea is the world's leading exporter of missile technology to rogue states, and there is every reason to fear its nuclear weapons will be for sale. </p> <p>By not setting priorities, the Bush administration lost control of the costs and the risks of its strategy. The Pentagon neo-conservatives planning postwar Iraq had grand ideas for a long occupation (modelled on postwar Germany and Japan), but only sent a minimal number of troops (for domestic political reasons). Because of limited resources, they simply assumed a benign environment, eliminating from their planning the possibilities of resistance and lawlessness. </p> <p>Similarly, the administration hoped that Saddam's removal would intimidate Iran and North Korea, as well as encourage pro-democracy elements in Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia. They apparently never contemplated what might happen if the US got bogged down in Iraq. With nine out of 10 active duty army divisions in Iraq and Afghanistan - or preparing to go - North Korea and Iran understand that there is no spare US capacity to deal with them. And in the Middle East, it is surely the hardliners and the Islamists - and not the democrats - who feel emboldened by developments in Iraq. </p> <p>The Bush doctrine can be criticised on many grounds. Under international law, pre-emption is permitted (if ever) only in the case of imminent attack and not to deal with a hypothetical future threat. Bush's nation building has been ambitious, arrogant and incompetent. But the greatest flaw of the Bush doctrine is that it is poor strategy. </p> <p>By not distinguishing between serious immediate threats and distant potential ones, Bush ducked the hard choice at the core of all sound national security strategy - how to ration scarce military and diplomatic assets. As a result, the US invaded Iraq to eliminate a threat posed by non-existent weapons. As for North Korea and Iran, the US is reduced to hoping that others - China in the case of Pyongyang and the Europeans in the case of Tehran - can solve the problem. Hope is not a strategy. </p> <p>Peter W Galbraith, a former US ambassador to Croatia, is senior diplomatic fellow at the Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peterwgalbraith@hotmail.com\">peterwgalbraith@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "It's time to rewrite Kafka. It's not that he got it wrong, but he saw man - it didn't happen to women, apparently - going somewhere and being dragged into incomprehensible and dangerous labyrinths. Kafka will now show us man and woman not going anywhere. This time, K, or \"the traveller\", will simply sit within arm's reach of the phone and the computer and it's this fact alone that will drag the new K into the same labyrinth. <p>The new Kafka will write it like this: the phone will ring and it's Brian from British Gas. He's noticed that you get your electricity from British Gas. For a moment, you think this is his little opening gag, so you laugh. He doesn't laugh. You feel bad. </p> <p>He points out that he can offer you a reduction on a service that you don't actually have. You laugh again. Again, he doesn't. You feel worse. </p> <p>He says that it's maintenance. You won't have to do anything. He can simply put it into place with this phone call. Surely it'll cost? No, not for the first three months. A little thought crosses your mind: does that mean it'll cost something thereafter? </p> <p>But Brian from British Gas is still talking. He's on to another offer; like the first, this one will be discounted too: he can offer maintenance on your fridge. Your fridge has never gone wrong. You wonder why you would want maintenance on a fridge. You stop him. You say, what about when the three months come to an end? Yes, you will be charged, he says. You ask him if you will be told when the three months is up and your payments start? No. Will you ever know how much these will be or when the discount will stop saving you money? No, says Brian and adds quickly, so, I can take it that you want the service - it won't cost you anything at this stage. </p> <p>You're not sure. You say that you're not sure. So, he says, that's fine, he'll sign you up anyway and when you make up your mind, you can carry on, or not. Nice talking to you, he says. End of call. You have a sense that someone took your arm off without you noticing. </p> <p>You turn to your computer for light relief, only to find that the \"Anytime\" facility that you thought allowed you to access the internet at any time doesn't work. A screen comes up which explains that you've used up your allowed time under the \"Anytime\" arrangement. You find that a phrase you learned at university, \"a contradiction in terms\" keeps coming to mind. </p> <p>You push it to one side and go practical. You see that until the end of the month (one week away) you'll have to go to \"Pay per minute\". So for a week, you pay per minute. </p> <p>This all goes fine for a day or two until you have an out-of-this-world sense that when you've been switching off \"Pay per minute\" you are in fact still paying. It's something to do with the way in which you come home to your computer after a four-hour break to find that accessing the internet doesn't involve dialling again. </p> <p>You realise you've been paying per minute for the last four hours while you were in the park and the library and the post office with your three-year-old. </p> <p>So how do you disconnect Pay per minute? You run the cursor all over the screen, clicking on every icon you can find. The longer you look, the more you pay. You call your teenage son to the screen and demand that he helps you. He laughs, says that you're Ozzy Osbourne and goes back to bed with his girlfriend. </p> <p>When the month is up and you've paid for hundreds of minutes, you're back on \"Anytime\". Now, the old window that used to offer you \"Disconnect?\" doesn't appear. You roam round the screen all over again, enraged that a global conspiracy of Microsoft, BT and Yahoo are stealing your money. Your partner calls out helpfully: \"Kafka was right.\" </p> <p>You say, \"No he wasn't. I didn't go somewhere, like K, and try to get something. I just sat here and it got me. It didn't get me when I was in the park. It gets me here, indoors. That out-Franzes Kafka\" </p> <p>An image comes to mind of an octopus. One of its tentacles is sliding through an open window. Another one is coming up the plughole in the bath. In a panic, you ring pest control. A voice offers you seven alternatives. You choose number three. You are offered another four alternatives. You choose number one. Some music plays. It stops. A voice says that they value your custom. The music starts again. You fall asleep, not realising that you are lying on something that is eating you.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Sutherland will appear tomorrow</p>",
  "Australia and Afghanistan don't have much in common, other than a vast, arid interior. But as voters in both countries cast their ballots over the weekend, their respective elections will have had an impact on political landscapes around the world. In the case of Afghanistan, the very fact of its holding democratic presidential elections is the most optimistic sign to come from that country for some time. Despite last-minute turmoil when 15 presidential rivals to the interim president, Hamid Karzai, called for a boycott over possible voting fraud, election observers declared the election to be fairly conducted. The sight of long queues patiently waiting outside polling stations on Saturday is some vindication of the international efforts to reconstruct Afghanistan, as is the absence of serious reprisals and violent attempts at disruption that had been threatened by supporters of the Taliban. <p>The long queues in Australia, meanwhile, were more a reflection of the country's legal requirement on its citizens to vote than a celebration of the flowering of democracy. John Howard's victory as leader of Australia's conservative coalition was a surprisingly strong one, after opinion polls had predicted a tight race. Instead, Mr Howard's coalition increased its majority in the lower house of parliament and looks likely to take control of the senate, making it the first time in 20 years that a government has dominated both houses. This will allow Mr Howard to push through unpopular measures on employment deregulation and loosening the country's media ownership laws in favour of global goliaths such as Rupert Murdoch's News International. </p> <p>Mr Howard's victory will be closely studied by the incumbents in Downing Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr Howard and his government had been a staunch member of the \"coalition of the willing\" that invaded Iraq last year, with Australia having 850 troops on the ground. The Labor opposition had boldly pledged to withdraw them by the end of the year, capitalising on winning support from those opposed to the war. But it is Australia's strong economy, with low unemployment and rising house prices, that appears to have had a greater influence on the election outcome. </p> <p>From the perspective of Tony Blair, the result is encouraging, a reminder that voters will choose domestic priorities over international affairs. The latest set of opinion polls bears this out, with Labour widening its lead over the Conservatives. Mr Blair's opponents would be unwise to rely on using Iraq as the sole fulcrum to lever him out of office.</p>",
  "The newly re-elected Australian prime minister, John Howard, could consolidate his hold on power with an outright majority in the senate, the first time for more than 20 years that the government has won control of both houses, it emerged yesterday. <p>The country's complex electoral system means that the final tally of senate seats will not be confirmed for several weeks, but there are indications that the ruling coalition will either win or fall one seat short of complete control.</p> <p>The latter scenario would give unprecedented influence to a newly formed party of the Christian right, Family First.</p> <p>Having comprehensively trounced his Labor rival, Mark Latham, in the elections on Saturday, Mr Howard's potential capture of the senate is likely to be the most important result of the election.</p> <p>A bloc of independent senators and minor parties traditionally prevent federal governments from controlling Canberra's second house, and since 1980 no prime minister has enjoyed a majority in both chambers. With complete control of parliament and an increased mandate from voters, Mr Howard will have the numbers to implement a more radical programme than he has ever attempted, a position that Family First, which has links to Australia's biggest Pentecostal church, is bound to want to take advantage of.</p> <p>There have been heart-on-sleeve Christians in Australian politics for many years, but the rise of a new strand of strident religious conservatism could change the face of political life in Canberra.</p> <p>The government made a pre-election offering to the Christian right in August when it amended the marriage act to insist that a marriage could only take place between a man and a woman.</p> <p>Mr Howard, who opened a 3,500-seat Pentecostal convention centre in 2002, has also promised to prepare \"family impact\" statements for all cabinet submissions as part of a pre-election voting deal with Family First.</p> <p>There is no indication yet as to what these statements will entail, but gay rights and working mothers have been longstanding targets of Australia's Christian family values campaigners.</p> <p>The Tasmanian Liberal MP Michael Ferguson cut his political teeth as director of the Tasmanian Family Institute, an organisation campaigning against the rights of same-sex couples to adopt.</p> <p>In Brisbane Family First has been embroiled in scandal after one party activist allegedly suggested that lesbians should be burnt as witches.</p> <p>Danny Nalliah, a Family First candidate on the party's Victorian senate ticket, has been accused of vilifying Muslims by the Islamic Council of Victoria, and put out a pre-election leaflet in which he urged followers to \"pull down Satan's strongholds\".</p> <p>\"Spot Satan's strongholds in the areas you are living (brothels, gambling places, bottleshops, mosque[sic], temples - Freemasons/Buddhist/Hindu etc, witchcraft,\" the leaflet read.</p> <p>The only prominent defeat suffered by the Christian right in Saturday's poll was that of the Liberal MP Ross Cameron, who fell foul of the family values code after revelations about his extra-marital affairs.</p> <p>Despite the emphasis on family values, the Christian right tends to be well to the left of the government on several of the more controversial issues which have convulsed Australian politics under Mr Howard. Family First's leader, Andrea Mason, is the only Aborigine to lead a major political party, and the party's immigration policy is to the left of both the government and opposition.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Geldof On Marriage</strong></p> <p>8pm, Channel 4</p> <p>The devastating breakup of his marriage to Paula Yates is what fuelled Bob Geldof to make this programme in which he investigates the state of marriage in Britain today. With one in every two couples breaking their marriage vows, Geldof asks why we celebrate marriage with such gusto when the divorce rate is so high. \"Marriage is not to be entered into and dissolved upon a whim,\" he implores, \"yet that is precisely what the law encourages us to do.\" Despite his heartfelt comments, Geldof retains objectivity, inviting debate from figures such as Alain de Botton, Alan Milburn and Germaine Greer.

He didn't of course. Quinn was set up by a CIA operative, but the powers that be think he's a rotten apple. So while the recovered Harry brings in MI6 officer Adam Carter (Rupert Penry- Jones) to help clear Quinn's name, Special Branch move in to suspend all officers. \"The whole culture at Thames House is rotten,\" says Oliver Mace (Tim McInnerny), sinister instigator of the purges, \"and we're cleaning the stables.\"</p> <p><strong>Trial and Retribution</strong></p> <p>9pm, ITV1</p> <p>David Hayman, Victoria Smurfit and Frances Barber star in this twopart thriller, concluding tomorrow.

  "<p>Malcolm Glazer is this week expected to try to persuade the Manchester United board to recommend a highly leveraged offer of 285p a share for the Premiership club. </p> <p>Mr Glazer and his sons are hoping to secure the support of the board members in the face of stiff opposition from the club's fans - many of whom are shareholders. </p> <p>But it is thought their offer values Manchester United at about \u00a3700m - some \u00a3100m less than first thought. </p> <p>The price is believed to be in the region of 285p a share, which may not be sufficiently high to win the backing of the two Irish horseracing tycoons who control almost 30% of Manchester United's stock. </p> <p>Manchester United chief executive David Gill has promised the Glazers that he will respond to their initial, tentative approach this week. </p> <p>The Glazers need the backing of the Manchester United board because they require access to crucial financial information to put together the financing for their deal. </p> <p>They need detailed information about the club's ticket sales and its merchandising revenues to help secure the support of the banks which are lending them the money for the deal. </p> <p>Their loan is secured on the securitisation of the ticket sales - and the banks lending them the money will have to be convinced about their ability to repay . </p> <p>The Glazers have not yet publicly acknowledged their interest in the club or the price they are prepared to pay. </p> <p>It is not thought that they have given Irish racehorse owners John Magnier and J P McManus any indication about the value of their deal, but if it is in the region of 285p it will be some 25p less than the 310p they are said to want for their shares. </p> <p>A source close to the Irish investors yesterday told Reuters news agency: \"Business people will always consider a proposition, and what's happening now is that people are leaping between someone listening to a proposition and accepting a proposition.\" </p> <p>The club's shares closed at 272p on Friday evening, valuing it at some \u00a3713m. </p> <p>Mr Magnier and Mr McManus started building their stake four years ago, at just over 100p a share. </p> <p>Keith Harris, the former chairman of the Football League, will be monitoring the latest developments closely. </p> <p>Mr Harris, who had initially consulted with Mr Glazer, is part of a London-based consortium exploring the possibilities of mounting a rival bid that will be more \"fan-friendly\". As yet, however, Mr Glazer is the only interested party to make a firm move. </p> <p>Mr Glazer has been taken aback by the depth of hostility shown towards him by United's supporters, but there has been no indication that it will deter him from going through with his plans. </p> <p>Members of a group calling itself the Manchester Education Committee disrupted a reserves match last Thursday when they invaded the pitch and held up a huge banner, saying: \"Not for sale\". </p> <p>The anti-Glazer feeling is so strong that Maurice Watkins, a United director, was targeted for selling some of his shares to the American. His car was vandalised outside his home. </p> <p>Fans are also planning to protest at United's next home match, against Arsenal on October 24. Supporters opposed a planned buyout of United in 1999 by BSkyB, prompting the government to refer the matter to competition regulators, who blocked the takeover. </p> <p>The latest takeover approach came a week after the club warned of a \u00a314m hit to profits this year due to lower television revenues and less money from European football after it finished third in the Premier League in 2003-2004. </p>",
  "<p>Regardless of what happened on Saturday at Old Trafford, Wales are approaching a crossroads this week. Mark Hughes's last game as manager is on Wednesday at home to Poland and an era will end. </p> <p>How it ends is now a prickly matter. Those who had not seen Wales regularly over the past two years may have been alarmed by how tame they were and how cautious Hughes was against England, but within Wales there has been rising anxiety about the direction of the team. </p> <p>This was not an isolated under-performance from Wales. This was their ninth consecutive competitive fixture without a win, a run stretching back to March 2003. </p> <p>Hughes chose the word \"factors\" rather than \"excuses\" in explaining Saturday's effort and sheer lack of numbers will always be an issue for Wales. </p> <p>This was hugely disappointing regardless but that shallow-squad background meant that, after Andy Melville pulled out of the game in the warm-up, Mark Delaney was moved to centre-half. </p> <p>Delaney is not a centre-half and proceeded to show it. Simon Davies, covering for Delaney, is not a right-back. Craig Bellamy is not a defensive midfielder. Jason Koumas is a clever footballer but this was a poor display from him. The same goes for Gary Speed, the captain. Ryan Giggs offered more material to those who argue his status within the game is inflated and not based on what he has done recently. </p> <p>Inevitably this meant John Hartson was alone against Sol Campbell and Rio Ferdinand. This would have been a tough job had Hartson played well but he did not. Consequently, collectively, Wales were a shadow. They looked overawed when the expectation was they would be angry. </p> <p>Hughes was angry when he was questioned after the previous match about Wales's inability to beat nine Northern Irishmen with 10 Welshmen. And he reacted aggressively at Saturday tea-time to suggestions that his side had been the opposite. </p> <p>If only his players had been as easily riled and one - it turns out to be the most important one, Robbie Savage - contrasted England's dogged pursuit of possession with Welsh wariness. </p> <p>\"That's what we should have been doing,\" Savage said, referring to David Beckham's descent on Danny Gabbidon that almost yielded a third England goal in the 78th minute. </p> <p>Savage was suspended having been sent off against the Irish and never have so many valued the shaggy-haired midfielder. Even the occasion missed Savage. Thankfully for Wales Savage is available to meet a Poland team in second place in the group after their 3-1 win in Austria. </p> <p>\"We've got to win on Wednesday,\" said Speed, \"otherwise we're out basically. You can't keep saying that second place is there; we've only got two points from three games and that's not good enough.\" </p> <p>Another draw, or a home defeat, would mean a damp finish to Hughes's five years in charge. It would also make the vacant post less attractive to potential suitors. </p> <p>Not only would Wales be playing without a realistic chance of reaching a play-off place; the six-month break to the next qualifier is an obvious moment for certain players to pull a curtain over their international career. </p> <p>Melville, said Hughes, will not have recovered in time for Poland and, 36 next month, the West Ham defender may feel 65 caps spread over 15 years is enough. Mark Pembridge, who struggled against Wayne Rooney, is 34 next month. Speed is 35. In goal Paul Jones is 37. </p> <p>The fear, a fear mentioned privately by Wales players, is that the ground claimed by Hughes in his first 3 years, will be ceded. The new levels of professionalism under Hughes are what they do not want to lose and they are vexed that their association may not have the same priorities. </p> <p>Details such as travel arrangements, hotels and pay tend to mushroom in importance when a team is not winning and for Wales it is no different. </p> <p>Then there is the future and the concern once again about the numbers and quality coming through. </p> <p>On Friday night at Ewood Park the Wales Under-21s lost by the same score as their seniors, no disgrace given that Wales's starting XI featured only three players learning their trade at Premiership clubs. </p> <p>An uplifting performance by the national team in Manchester would have surely acted as a rallying cry to players at all levels. </p> <p>But now there is trepidation as the crossroads looms. </p> <p>Only time will tell if Bellamy was correct in his assessment. \"Disastrous\".</p>",
  "<p>Governments must work together to lift the \"cloak of anonymity\" that shields people who send email spam and prevent a loss of trust in legitimate e-commerce, experts said at a conference today.</p> <p>Representatives of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), speaking at the first international conference of email regulators, said law enforcement agencies must join forces to target the most prolific international spammers.</p> <p>They said the bulk of spam received by UK internet users originated from overseas - primarily from the US, China and Korea - making cross-border cooperation essential in tackling what is a vehicle for online fraud and computer viruses.</p> <p>\"We are all united by a common goal - to stop deceptive and fraudulent spam from flooding our email boxes, threatening our data security, and undermining email's effectiveness as a tool for commerce and communication,\" Deborah Majoras, the FTC chairwoman, said.</p> <p>\"Spammers hide behind the cloak of anonymity provided by the latest technology, and the path from a spammer to a consumer's inbox typically crosses one border, if not several.</p> <p>\"It's our biggest problem tracing the origin of spam, so providing information between countries on how to track them [spammers] down is imperative. In the cyber-speedy world of spam, it is essential that we move quickly to catch them.\"</p> <p>Bulk unsolicited email, commonly referred to as spam, accounts for more than 60% of all email traffic on the internet, and is linked to fraudulent, deceptive or pornographic activities. </p> <p>Today's so-called \"spam summit\", taking place in London, has brought together consumer and data protection officers and telecommunications executives from more than 20 countries.</p> <p>John Vickers, the OFT chairman, said spam deceit was a \"sophisticated criminal activity\" and posed a major threat to legitimate e-commerce.</p> <p>\"Our concern is the rising tide of unsolicited email coursing around the internet much of it laden with fraud, deception and viruses,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We are all familiar with the annoyance, invasion of privacy and cost that spam brings, but that is just part of the problem - spam is threatening the enormous potential for good that e-commerce, and the web generally, has opened up.</p> <p>\"Safeguarding that good, as well as combating the evil of the scams, is the challenge for us all. International collaboration by enforcement agencies, the efforts of the computer and communications industries and smart consumers at home, who take steps to protect themselves, are all needed to combat the spammers.\"</p> <p>According to Mr Vickers, one solution would be for internet service suppliers to charge for sending unwanted marketing emails, and another for workplaces to install spam filters. </p> <p>Richard Thomas, the UK's information commissioner, warned that spam was not just about email. \"We're coming across a hard core of UK spammers who are sending SMS text messages via mobile phones, or using faxes,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Thomas, whose job is to enforce the Data Protection Act and the Freedom of Information Act, called for increased powers to crack down on spammers.</p> <p>\"My powers are still not strong enough,\" he said. \"I'm seeking the power to get information from third parties who know what is going on. There is currently no obligation for internet service providers to provide information.</p> <p>\"The second is to ensure an injunction can be obtained rapidly when something comes to light - a fast-track solution so that, when we have got the evidence, we can go to court straight away.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two touchdown passes from Tom Brady helped the New England Patriots to a record-breaking 19th consecutive victory with a 24-10 win over Miami in Foxboro.</p> <p>The Patriots had shared the 18-game record with the Chicago sides of 1933-34 and 1941-42, Miami's 1972-73 team, the San Francisco side of 1989-90 and the Denver side 1997-98 before this weekend. If they beat Seattle next week, New England will level the mark of 17 consecutive regular season wins set by the Bears in 1933-34. If they beat the New York Jets the following Sunday, they'll break that record too. </p> <p>\"It doesn't mean anything right now because we are still in the middle of the season,\" cornerback Ty Law said. \"The fruit will taste a little bit sweeter if we can give ourselves an opportunity to play for another championship.\"</p> <p>The New England coach, Bill Belichick, was equally downbeat. \"He said, 'Congratulations on the streak, great job.

New England's offence struggled to fire and it took Brady's two touchdown passes, a one-yarder to Daniel Graham in the first quarter and another short range throw to David Givens in the second, to give the scoreline a degree of comfort that the performance had not matched. Brady had an otherwise quiet game, throwing for just 76 yards and allowing Corey Dillon, who rushed for 94 yards, to carry the bulk of New England's attacking threat. </p> <p>The Patriots lead the AFC East from the New York Jets, who also extended their unbeaten start to the season after a scare against Buffalo. The Jets led 13-0 at the start of the fourth quarter but two touchdown passes from Drew Bledsoe put the Bills ahead before a 38-yard Doug Brien field goal in the final minute gave the New York side a 16-14 win.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Indianapolis Colts continued their solid start to the season with a 35-14 thumping of the Oakland Raiders for their fourth win against one defeat. The Pittsburgh Steelers also went 4-1 but a poor defensive display meant that their 35-23 win over the Cleveland Browns was less comfortable than it might have been.</p> <p>Three fourth-quarter touchdowns for Houston were not enough as they slipped to a 34-28 home defeat to Minnesota. Daunte Culpepper's 50-yard touchdown pass to Marcus Robinson on Minnesota's second possession in overtime gave the Vikings victory.</p> <p>In New Orleans, Brian Griese threw for 194 yards and the decisive touchdown as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers edged out the Saints 20-17 for their first win of the season. The New York Giants improved to 4-1 with a 26-10 win over the Dallas Cowboys and the Detroit Lions handed the Falcons their first defeat by prevailing 17-10 in Atlanta. Last season's Super Bowl losers the Carolina Panthers slipped to 1-3 with a 20-17 defeat against the Broncos in Denver.</p>",
  "From a distance, the people standing around a town square table in red jackets look like a marketing team giving away free orange juice, but get a little closer and it is clear that they are pushing a quite different product. The mixed-race, mixed-age team are political activists who represent the great unknown quantity in next month's presidential election: the 527s. <p>The catchy umbrella title refers to the tax code for a group of organisations that has mainly come into being since campaign finance law made it illegal two years ago for parties to accept large contributions from corporations, unions or individuals. </p> <p>What it means on the ground in the swing states that will decide the presidency is impossible to judge now; what is clear is that they have already changed the character of the race and will continue to do so until November 2. </p> <p>The red jackets standing around in the main square of Wilkes-Barre, in eastern Pennsylvania, are from <a href=\" http://www.act4victory.org \" target=\"_new\"> America Coming Together</a>, a multimillion-dollar donor network with offices in 17 states. Technically, the organisation is non-partisan, but it is openly dedicated to overthrowing the Bush administration. </p> <p>The orange juice is just a way of illustrating one criticism: that the last two rounds of tax cuts have squeezed the middle class, which is now left with a huge deficit to pay off while the rich enjoy a windfall. </p> <p>This is campaigning in all but name. The obvious beneficiary of the group's imaginative public awareness exercise is the Kerry-Edwards campaign - but 527 status means that any coordination with political parties is strictly prohibited. </p> <p>\"We're not selling a candidate; we're selling issues - educating people and mobilising them,\" says Sean Carr, ACT's press spokesman, based in nearby Allentown. He adds: \"When I've asked a lot of people why they never got involved in politics before they just say, 'Well, no one ever asked me.'\"</p> <p>Mr Carr, a New Jersey resident, left \"a government job, my fiancee and my dog\" to get involved full time at the beginning of the summer. Like the other activists I met, most of whom were trade unionists sporting ACT jackets and talking of regime change, he is being paid.</p> <p>After the election Tyrek Lee, 27, will be going back to his job in Boston, where he has three kids waiting for him. \"This is for their future,\" he told me. \"These 30 days here are worth it for them and for the rest of America.\" </p> <p>I asked several of the ACT staffers which way they would be voting, which induced a serious bout of squirming. \"I don't talk about my individual vote,\" said Mr Carr, adding: \"When we give people the facts on the issues, I think they will vote in a good way.\" </p> <p>Sympathetic visitors to the Middle-Class Squeeze orange juice stand were also asked to give a name and phone number to help get the vote out on election day. ACT replaces the usual party rhetoric of \"Vote for me\" with pocket-sized leaflets stating: \"Take the pledge! Your vote makes the difference.\" </p> <p>Wilkes-Barre voters who were prepared to engage in conversation with the ACT team were generally sympathetic to the Kerry cause. Ironically, the rather dilapidated square where we stood had been encircled with plastic barriers in preparation for a presidential campaign stop the following day. </p> <p>George Barron, a Democrat-supporting attorney who passed by, said he had profoundly mixed feelings about the 527 phenomenon: \"The unfortunate thing on both sides is that they have been more negative and less responsible than the candidates themselves.\" </p> <p>He said the advertising end of the 527 operation, led in oppositional terms by <a href=\" http://www.moveon.org/front/\" target=\"_new\"> MoveOn.org</a> had encouraged a new \"nastiness\".</p> <p>\"As long as the <a href=\"http://www.swiftvets.com \" target=\"_new\"> Swift Boat Veterans for Truth</a> are out there making noise we need folks on the other side doing the same .\"</p> <p>But he added: \"I would like to think after this election these 527s will be eliminated, because it defeats the entire purpose of campaign reform.\"</p> <p>Progressive 527s may truly have had no contact whatsoever with Democratic strategy chiefs - or enraged swift boat vets with the Bush campaign - yet their positioning has been complementary. They have spent money and attacked with advertising in places where the party could not go. In Pennsylvania, the voting registration deadline was last Monday, and early indications are that tens of thousands more people have signed up than did in 2000. </p> <p>ACT's office in the classic swing voter territory of the Lehigh Valley provides some insight into why the political party establishment is viewing the 527 ground operation as a force to be reckoned with. </p> <p>The network of rooms at the back of a shabby local hotel has all the feel of a local campaign headquarters in full swing, without the obligatory stack of candidates' biographies and smiling posters. </p> <p>The field director in charge, Siobhan \"Sam\" Bennett, 47, is almost messianic about her task and the youthful team around her. She is a registered Democrat who ran for city mayor four years ago, losing by a few dozen votes to a seasoned Republican incumbent. </p> <p>She sees no contradiction in shelving her party connections for an operation that serves both her causes well. \"This is an important region on the ground floor in terms of making sure that everyone who should be registered is registered and making sure that everyone votes,\" she said. </p> <p>\"How can we remain healthy as a nation, irrespective of party, if people are not engaged in the political process? Declining voter participation is terribly damaging to our long-term health.\" </p> <p>Her idealistic and genuine hope is that ACT will make more people take part, and she goes a great deal further in transcending the party political prism than does the organisation's own website. She used to vote Republican until the Clinton era: \"At the door, we don't ever mention George's name here when we work. What's important to me are the issues,\" she says.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, local Republican officials do not recognise the civic-mindedness of the ACT and MoveOn agenda: \"They are shadowy groups funded by unregulated, soft money,\" said Mark Pfeifle, a media spokesman for the Bush campaign in Pennsylvania, who clearly sees the 527s as an electoral threat. </p> <p>\"Our grassroots operation has been empowered and excited by them. We have an army of volunteers who have made more than one million phone contacts; they, on the other hand, are paying people to come in from out of state.\" </p> <p>ACT has attracted thousands of volunteers of its own to help the huge doorstep operation in cities like Allentown. Many of them have indeed come by bus for the day or for the weekend from places such as nearby New York. Plenty of their volunteers are also locally based, say officials. </p> <p>One thing that both ACT and the state's Bush-Cheney campaign would agree on is that there is no way of properly judging the 527 effect until election day itself, although the local polling evidence is looking good for the anti-Bush lobby. </p> <p>Chris Borick, director of the public opinion institute at Muhlenberg college in Allentown, said that after being tied in the spring Kerry this week had a 6% edge over Bush among registered voters in the Lehigh Valley area. </p> <p>\"The 527s' presence is being clearly felt in local grassroots politics,\" he said. \"They are, by design, supposed to be unaffiliated with the campaigns, but by their very nature then go hand in hand ... While legally bound to be separate, in reality they are intertwined.\" </p> <p>With relatively small numbers of swing voters remaining, the decisive factor may be simply getting out the vote, he said: \"Something I'm not sure we are truly picking up in the way we model our polling numbers is greater-than-expected turnout. These groups could tip the balance in terms of mobilisation.</p> <p>\"When we look back at the book of the 2004 election, I am anticipating that 527s will be a fairly substantial chapter.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column on Friday October 15 2004</strong></p> <p>The International Cricket Council has pointed out that, contrary to the impression given in this article, it has made \u00a310,000 available to both the Zimbabwe Cricket Union and to the group of former Zimbabwe players who are parties to the current hearing into racism in that country.</p> <p><br>The 12 remaining Zimbabwean rebels who walked out on their national team six months ago and effectively instigated an International Cricket Council investigation into claims of racism and improper behaviour by key members of their cricket union have filed an official letter of complaint to the ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed. </p> <p>A statement is expected from the ICC at its next meeting, on October 16-17. </p> <p>The letter outlines grievances about the way in which the ICC's short-lived investigation was conducted in Harare last month, when less than half a day of the scheduled three-day hearing took place. It also quotes assurances from one of the two investigators, the South African high court judge Steven Majiedt, that he and India's solici tor general Goolam Vahanvati would \"investigate questions of fact\" and that \"counsel would be constrained from excessive cross-examination\". </p> <p>Norman Arendse, the ZCU's intimidating advocate, fought for three ZCU directors to be present but the investigators sustained the players' objection. So why, they ask, was the investigation cancelled when the ZCU refused to comply? Two of its directors - the chief executive Ozias Bvute and selection convenor Max Ebrahim - are the subjects of most complaints. </p> <p>\"We had 12 witnesses waiting, some who had travelled great distances. The inquiry could still have proceeded with certain witnesses giving evidence in front of all the directors. They were never given the chance,\" the letter states. </p> <p>The rebels add that much of the written evidence presented by their witnesses would be dismissed as \"irrelevant and speculative\" without oral testimony to provide background and context. None of the players handed in submissions either, as they planned to give oral evidence. </p> <p>The letter also highlights the case of a Zimbabwean journalist Mehluli Sibanda, the only man to give evidence. \"Contrary to assurances, he was given no option but to agree to his identity being revealed,\" they said, reminding Speed that investigators had earlier agreed that \"Sibanda was at risk\". </p> <p>The letter ends with a paragraph concerning a donation made by Speed to assist the players. They thanked him for his \"genuine attempts\" to resolve the issue but added, \"We have seven thousand pounds in trust. Please provide your bank details and a formal remittance so we can obtain authority to repatriate it to you.\"</p>",
  "<p>Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, the UK's second biggest insurer, today incurred the wrath of unions by announcing plans to move more than 1,000 jobs to India.</p> <p>The company said 1,100 jobs, representing 10% of its entire workforce, would be transferred over the next two years, saving it more than \u00a310m a year. </p> <p>The UK job losses will occur in call centres as well as in administration and processing departments across the country.</p> <p>Royal &amp; Sun said it would try to avoid compulsory redundancies, an aim it said was realistic given the rate of turnover in the industry. </p> <p>The insurer already has 100 workers in Bangalore, at a pilot operation set up by six months ago by the consultancy group Accenture. </p> <p>The new jobs will at first be created in the city, India's technology capital.

  "<p>New digital-age methods of measuring radio audiences are to be tested in a 'pioneering' trial aimed at improving the accuracy of listening figures.</p> <p>A whole floor of a north London hotel is being taken over for a weekend next month as 250 people take part in a bid to prove the accuracy, or otherwise, of three rival electronic measuring devices.</p> <p>The test is part of the timetable Rajar, the industry body that measures radio listening, has put in place to change the way it finds out which stations the nation is listening to.</p> <p>Its pen-and-paper-diary method of collecting data has been criticised for being outdated and subject to human error, with the possibility of people jotting down the wrong station.</p> <p>Following years of pressure, most notably and vocally from Kelvin MacKenzie's Wireless Group, Rajar last month announced its controversial diaries would be replaced witha system of electronic measurement in 2007.</p> <p>The tests taking place on November 13-14 will test how well the devices can identify up to 33 stations, both music and speech-based, in a wide range of \"real-life\" situations and against various levels of background noise.</p> <p>Rajar has specified several criteria that the audiometers should fulfil. These include the ability to identify all formats equally, whether music or speech, against a variety of extraneous background noises, when played at differing volume levels and regardless of whether the wearers are stationary or in motion.</p> <p>The test has been designed with - and will be managed and overseen by - the National Centre for Social Research, and the results will be presented to the Rajar's board in December. </p> <p>They will test Arbitron's Portable People Meter, Italian company Eurisko's World Media Monitor and the GfK/Telecontrol's wristwatch, which is used by Mr MacKenzie's group to publish alternative listening figures to Rajar's.</p> <p>Paul Kennedy, research director at Rajar, called the test \"pioneering\" and said: \"Once we have analysed the results from these tests and, assuming we have a successful audiometer or audiometers, then we will be able to progress quickly to regional fieldwork tests and a new specification in 2005.\"</p> <p>Rajar has already carried out a series of extensive tests on electronic measurement devices, but found them inconclusive, and decided to stick with its diary method until a reliable failsafe alternative could be found.</p> <p>But announcing the 2007 changeover date next month, the Rajar managing director, Sally de la Bedoyere, admitted it left little room for error in the test this time.</p> <p>The contract to gather radio audience data expires next year and Rajar expects to have a new deal in place by September 2005.

  "Read the media and you'll be aware of a momentous political event taking place some way east of California. Over on the other coast something called the 2004 presidential election is happening. Swing voters are being courted, canvassers are knocking on doors, and suspicious-sounding 527 committees are piling money into local TV commercials. But out here on the west coast, where people are as passionate about their politics as anywhere else, the whole thing seems like a phoney war. Sure, there are petitioners on street corners and leafleters at farmers' markets, but where oh where are the real politicians? California needs to see more of middle-aged men kissing babies, it needs to see more secret servicemen wearing mirror shades, it needs more senseless ticketed photo ops dressed up as political rallies. <p>True, Bush and Kerry both visited Los Angeles in the summer, indeed in the same week, and they both put in an appearance in the spring, going to their rich friends' houses to ask for money. But compared to four years ago the attention paid to the nation's most populous state, the state with the largest economy in the union, the state that has given most money to the presidential candidates, has been pitiful. </p> <p>Four years ago, California was the centre of things presidential as the Democrats held their convention in Los Angeles. The candidates swung through the state, they even had their photo taken with the governor. But this time, no one is coming to the party. </p> <p>The main reason is that, without a convention to go to, national candidates figure that there is little to be gained from the long trek to the west coast. Californian voters, polling wisdom tells us, have made up their minds, and their minds are firmly Democrat. So the Kerry-Edwards team stays away, not wanting to waste money on the converted, while the Bush-Cheney camp prefers to focus on the swing states. After all, it's a long way from Florida to California. </p> <p>But California, according to the latest polls, is slightly more complicated than they imagine. For a start, the state mirrors the nation. The coast is liberal, the interior more conservative. The further you travel from the Pacific, the more Republican the voters become. Californians also tend to be classic third way voters, sticking to neither liberal nor conservative orthodoxies: they are liberal on social issues, such as gun control, abortion, the environment, but are fiscal conservatives, preferring deregulation, low taxes and small government.</p> <p>If you were to try to embody this confused political philosophy in one person, that figure might look something like Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. His recent flurry of decisions on bills passed by the state's legilsature have revealed him to be, well, unexpectedly liberal on some social issues - he is a Republican, after all - and convincingly conservative on others. So he has approved the distribution of clean hypodermic needles to people without prescription, toughened gun control and strengthened the rights of same-sex couples. But his conservative side has vetoed legislation promising an increase in the minimum wage, granting driving licences to undocumented immigrants and extending health insurance to cover maternity. Schwarzenegger has passed all of the tests set for him by the state's chamber of commerce, opposing all the legislation the chamber opposed and proving himself to be a reliable friend of car dealers, the pharmaceutical industry and big business in general.</p> <p>Of course, Governor Schwarzenegger is one explanation for the absence of the big players from California. His star wattage remains undimmed, despite the various political setbacks he has endured during the first 11 months of his mandate. No national politician in his right mind would be tempted by the prospect of sharing Arnold's spotlight in California. </p> <p>But Schwarzenegger is also one reason why it might make sense for the national players to come to California. His liberal credentials have earned him widespread support among Democrats and, if the state were ever to sway toward the Republicans, this might be the time. Recent polling suggests that the state may not be the shoo-in Democrats have for so long assumed. Three polls published in the last week send the sort of mixed message that can make George Bush so snippy. The Field Poll has Kerry leading Bush by 49-40, down from 53-41 in August, which in turn was down from a Kerry lead of 55-40 in May. But a survey by San Jose State University has Kerry ahead by just six points, at 48-42, down from his lead of 50-28 in July. And, just to confuse matters, the latest Rasmussen survey, covering the week to October 4, has Kerry ahead 53-40. </p> <p>Of course what will actually happen on November 2 is that John Kerry will win California, taking all its 55 electoral college votes with him and bearing out the decisions of the two campaigns not to bother with the state. Hopefully that result will lend weight to calls for reform of the winner-takes-all formula governing the presidential election. But don't hold your breath.</p>",
  "<p>With the death of actor and activist <a href=\"http://www.chrisreevehomepage.com/\">Christopher Reeve </a>at 52, a condolence book has sprung up on the Christopher Reeve homepage, an unofficial fan site. Tributes have rolled in from around the world. A message posted by a fan in Scotland reads: \"Christopher's courage was inspiring. I hope that, having left his paralysed body behind, his spirit can soar.\"</p> <p>The sentiment is repeated again and again across the web today. The <a href=\"http://www.supermanhomepage.com/movies/movies.php?topic=\" m-movie1\" \">Superman</a> actor, paralysed from the neck down after a horse riding accident in 1995, became a symbol of obstinate hope against a condition many believed could never be improved.</p> <p>Reeve was always determined he would walk again, and initially believed it would be possible by the time he was 50. He did achieve some success against paralysis: moving his fingers, legs and arms, sensing hot and cold, feeling some sensation, gaining a certain amount of freedom from his respirator.</p> <p>For a 2003 article in the <a href=\"http://www.jeromegroopman.com/reeve.html\">New Yorker</a>, writer Jerome Groopman visited Reeve at his Bedford, New York home and witnessed the actor's unswerving optimism and faith in scientific advances. </p> <p>Reeve was a strong supporter of stem cell research and was working to progress the <a href=\"http://olpa.od.nih.gov/legislation/108/pendinglegislation/paralysis.asp\">Christopher Reeve Paralysis Act </a>through Congress. The bill would dedicate \u00a3300m to spinal cord research. </p> <p>Some disabled people, however, argued that Reeve - from a relatively privileged position - was offering false hope to others reliant on respirators and wheelchairs, who needed to learn to make a life for themselves. In particular, his critics cited his decision to make an advertisement - aired during the <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/feb2000/nf00209d.htm  \">2000 Super Bowl </a>- that showed a computer-modified Reeve walking across a stage to present an award. It was an imagining, Reeve argued, of a distinct possibility in the not too distant future. </p> <p>The Christopher Reeve homepage, by the way, has a complete listing of <a href=\"http://www.chrisreevehomepage.com/shop.html#books\">books</a> by and about Reeve, along with videos and DVDs of his films. </p> <p>You can make a donation in Reeve's honour to the <a href=\"http://www.christopherreeve.org\">Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation</a> via the foundation's website. A notice on the site says that cards may also be sent to the family in care of the foundation at 500 Morris Avenue, Springfield, New Jersey 07081, USA.</p>",

  "<p>At least once a week, Julie would wake up and know from her husband's expression that it would be a battle to get out of the door and go to work. \"He couldn't deal with the fact that I earned more than him and he'd start shouting at me if he woke up feeling grouchy,\" she recalls. \"Once in a while, he'd hit me. If it was bad, I'd have to phone in sick. Over time, my boss got more and more fed up and eventually I was sacked. Then my husband hit me for not bringing any money in.\" </p> <p>Five years later, Julie is long free of her husband and she has a high-flying job as an office manager. She is understandably proud of the courage it took her to leave literally everything behind - that was the price she had to pay to start a new, safer life. But the one person she believes could have supported her more was her boss. \"I'd told her what was going on. At that time, she was the only person I'd told. But rather than providing any help, she made my life 10 times worse by getting rid of me.\" </p> <p>Julie's story is by no means unique. One in four women will suffer domestic violence, according to victims' charity Refuge, and many of them face the added burden of disciplinary action at work - the place they often feel to be their only safe haven. </p> <p>The Government believes it's high time employers offered greater support to people with personal problems like domestic violence, not just because they have a duty of care towards their employees, but because it's in their own interests. The Cost of Domestic Violence, a report by Professor Sylvia Walby at the University of Leeds, assesses the cost to the UK economy of time off work due to injuries inflicted on one partner by another at nearly \u00a33bn. </p> <p>In addition, domestic violence can influence an employee's morale, work performance and productivity, as well as their career development. \"In the worst-case scenario, the employer may even lose the victim to death. Two women are killed each week in the UK by their current or ex-partner,\" says Refuge's spokeswoman, Olivia Lamb. </p> <p>\"Of course my ability to do my job was affected,\" says Julie. \"I was living in fear. My mental health was a mess. But I really do believe that I had been working in a supportive environment, it wouldn't have been like that. In fact, my next employer was a major influence in me leaving my husband. She pointed me in the direction of proper help and made it clear that she would stand by me, even if things got bad.\" </p> <p>The reality is that very few companies have a policy on domestic violence and some people - including Dianah Worman, diversity adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) - believe that developing one is not the answer. \"It's not about policies or firms taking a parental role. HR couldn't broach the subject with someone,\" she says. </p> <p>Stephanie Klass, commercial law partner at Berg &amp; Co, solicitors, agrees that employers need to tread very carefully. \"I do think those who believe staff may be experiencing domestic violence should enquire as to whether that individual needs help, but I don't think they should voice their suspicions directly. And if such enquiries or offers of help are consistently refused, the employer must respect that decision,\" she says. </p> <p>The fact that domestic violence remains so hidden poses a major problem for employers, even if they do want to help, according to Rebecca Gill, policy officer on women's equality at the TUC. \"Many of the women we anonymously surveyed on the subject had lived with domestic violence for 20 to 25 years and had never told anybody,\" she says. \"In fact, the reason we did the survey was because trade unions were coming to us, saying that they were facing disciplinary cases on behalf of these women, but that they were reluctant to say why they'd been absent.\" </p> <p>But she insists that this is no excuse for employers avoiding the issue. \"They have a major role to play. We are not asking them to be counsellors, but to signpost women to where they can get help and put in place any procedures that could help. Just having a poster on the noticeboard with a phone number could save a life. Meanwhile, a large company could help a victim who does come forward about their abuse by offering a transfer to an office in another city, which could enable them to escape the violence and begin a new life. We know that financial dependence is a crucial part of the psychological abuse that a lot of these victims suffer.\" Others go much further. Domestic violence suffered by an employee at South Hams and West Devon Primary Care Trust prompted the trust to tackle the issue for all staff. Sue Behenna, then the HR manager, says benefits for employees suffering from abuse now include the provision of temporary mobile phones, special paid leave, financial loans and redeployment. \"It's often seen as a taboo, private subject that employers have no business to get involved in, but I felt that was wrong,\" she says. </p> <p>It's not only victims who have been receptive to the policy, she says. \"Many managers had unwittingly stumbled across the issue before and tried to help, but in hindsight realised they'd been clumsy. They appreciate the measured approach we now have.\" </p> <p>Nationwide building society has a policy that is particularly effective because victims don't have tell their employers about the violence to gain the support. Its emphasis on work-life balance, for example, allows people to take time off at short notice for short periods, without saying why. In addition, Nationwide provides a welfare fund with interest-free loans to help alleviate immediate financial problems, plus around-the-clock access to free and confidential counselling services. \"If people are happy at work, they'll do a good job and there are also benefits for us around staff loyalty,\" says spokesman Tim Hughes. </p> <p>Other employers are focusing on helping people not to become victims in the first place and some even help potential perpetrators to develop better ways of coping with stress. And companies that offer employee assistance programmes (external and general counselling and information services) are often helping victims without realising it. Kevin Friery, director of counselling at Right Corecare says he hears from many domestic violence victims. \"We recently had a case of someone who lived with a particularly nasty man and the only way she was going to be able to break away from the violent and drug-ridden relationship was to physically move away. We worked with her employer to get her redeployed.\" </p> <p>Domestic violence can exist in isolation but it is often linked with other issues like alcohol and drug addiction. \"That's one of the reasons I believe employers need to have policies around all these things,\" says Friery. \"They need to accept that all personal problems can spill into the workplace and that they should therefore have a role in providing support.\" </p> <p>As with domestic violence, though, few employers so far have taken this on board. In fact, many take a contrary approach, having followed the trend from the States of introducing random drink and drugs tests which, if positive, can lead to instant dismissal. Friery believes this is misguided. \"Testing should not be carried out unless the employer is prepared to take a sympathetic manner. The employee may be dependent - which is essentially an issue of ill health and should be treated as such,\" he explains. Especially, Friery points out, because it is more and more often stress in the workplace that causes an employee to turn to drink or drugs in the first place. </p> <p>Consequently, Right Core care is among a growing number of organisations involved in helping employers to formulate a firm but compassionate drink and drugs policy. \"In fact, many of the policies that work are similar to those in place for domestic violence - providing counselling and advice on where to get treatment, attempting to prevent the problem occurring in the first place and enabling staff to take time off to deal with their problem where necessary, as well as accepting that many employees may not want to admit to having a problem,\" says Friery. </p> <p>Alcohol Concern, which also helps employers create policies covering both alcohol and drug use, agrees this is the way forward. \"We too put the emphasis on rehabilitation rather than disciplinary procedures,\" says a spokesman. \"In fact, we encourage employers to create a culture in which staff who have a problem can come forward rather than being caught out in random testing.\" </p> <p>And this, believes Dianah Worman of the CIPD, is the approach that employers should take when it comes to all personal problems that affect their employees' working lives. \"Employers need to develop a climate of trust so people feel they can talk about it,\" she says. But if the Government, as well as many charities, get their way, employers of the future will have a far more intercessionary role than that and the boundary between home and work may become increasingly blurred. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The 24-hour National Domestic Violence freephone helpline: 0808 2000 247.

  "Tony Blair today promised to undo the British class system and make increased social mobility the mission of his third term as prime minister by expanding choice in the public services. <p>Speaking to the Institute of Public Policy Research in London, Mr Blair said that realising his vision of an \"opportunity society\" would require radical reform of the welfare state and a resolute continuation of the New Labour project.</p> <p>\"We have made real progress in Britain in the past seven and a half years,\" he said. \"But the truth about the country is that for almost 30 years, social mobility has stayed relatively constant.</p> <p>\"I want to see social mobility, as it did for the decades after the war, rising once again, a dominant feature of British life.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The third-term vision has to be to alter fundamentally the contract between citizen and state ... to move from a welfare state that relieves poverty and provide basic services to one which offers high-quality services and the opportunity for all to fulfil their potential.\"</p> <p>Outlining his plans to increase choice in childcare provision, pensions, public health and lifelong education and training, Mr Blair announced that a series of \"forward policy strategies\" would be published in the months running up to the general election.</p> <p>These, along with the five-year plans already published on health, education, transport, and law and order, will form the basis of Labour's election manifesto and the genesis of a series of reform acts in a possible third term.</p> <p>Mr Blair coupled the announcement of his plans for the future with an attack on those of the Conservatives and the reservations of his critics on the left of his own party.</p> <p>He accused the Tories of having \"looked at their polling and focus groups and decided to retreat to where they are most comfortable, beguiled by apparent support for hard-right positions on issues like immigration and Europe\".</p> <p>Dismissing Michael Howard's \"timetable for action\" a series of \"minimalist pledges\", Mr Blair said it was designed to conceal his \"laughably inconsistent\" policy platform.</p> <p>He said: \"The Tory alternative will not be presented primarily as a policy alternative. They dare not do that, because every time their major policies are exposed - particularly their ever-changing patients' and pupils' passports - they reveal themselves for what they are: policies to benefit a small minority of the better-off at the expense of the rest.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair's speech comes after Mr Howard suffered another poll battering. The Tory leader's speech to his party's annual conference last week tried to capitalise on waning public faith in the prime minister. However, Mr Blair was voted most trusted party leader in a poll that placed Mr Howard third behind the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy. </p> <p>Labour also leads the Tories by nine points on 39%, with the Lib Dems on 23% in the latest ICM survey for the Sunday Telegraph. </p> <p>That would hand Mr Blair a historic third landslide victory with an estimated majority of 154 in the general election expected next May. </p> <p> Meanwhile, the Conservative chairman, Liam Fox, dismissed Mr Blair's speech as \"yet more talk\" and insisted that the Tories' proposals were more far-reaching than the government's.</p> <p>\"He cannot stop talking about building new societies and new economies. So far, we've had 'the decent society', 'the creative economy', 'a stakeholder economy', 'a new Age of Achievement' and 'the partnership economy'. </p> <p>\"Not to mention 'New Labour's Millennium Challenge', 'the information superhighway', 'a people's Europe' and, of course, 'the third way'. </p> <p>\"All this from the man who said 'this is no time for soundbites'.\" </p> <p>Dr Fox said that all Labour had achieved was \"a pension crisis; 66 tax rises; a million violent crimes; a million people waiting for NHS treatment and a million children playing truant\". </p> <p>He went on: \"No wonder people feel let down by Labour. Our proposals on healthcare, education, immigration, Europe and pensions are more far reaching than anything Labour are proposing.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government is attempting to strip the proposed children's commissioner for England of their ability to promote and protect children's rights, campaigners claimed today.</p> <p>Amendments to the children bill proposed by the children's minister, Margaret Hodge, would restrict the commissioner to merely concern themselves with the \"views and interests of children\".</p> <p>This would significantly downgrade the commissioner's role, which is currently proposed as to promote and safeguard the \"rights and interests of children\".</p> <p>The amendments, which will be put forward at the committee stage of the bill tomorrow, remove five references to children's rights within the first five pages of the proposed legislation.</p> <p>Carolyne Willow, national coordinator of the Children's Rights Alliance for England (CRAE), said children's commissioners need to be empowered to do more than \"promote awareness\".</p> <p>\"We are dismayed by the minister's apparent determination to weaken the commissioner's role,\" she said.</p> <p>Hilton Dawson, joint chairman of the all-party parliamentary children group, accused the government of trying to \"give children little more significance than animals\".</p> <p>The Labour MP for Lancaster and Wyre said: \"When parliament discusses a ban on fox hunting or the welfare of pigs we talk about those animals' interests. </p> <p>\"The government usually resists talking of animal rights and claims a commitment to the rights of children. However, these last minute amendments would ensure that the children's watchdog will have nothing to do with the obligations of the state and no role in relation to the rights of the child.\"</p> <p>Mr Dawson said the move was \"grossly demeaning and disrespectful to children\".</p> <p>CRAE said if the government amendments were passed, the English commissioner would be the only one of the 20 in the UK and Europe that would merely listen to children's concerns, rather than champion their rights.</p>",
  "<p>State school teachers today entered the row over a leading private school head, saying they supported the decision to require him to complete a one-year training course before qualifying to work in a state school.</p> <p>The National Union of Teachers (NUT) also called for a change in the law to require all private school teachers to be fully trained to teach.</p> <p>Tristram Jones-Parry, head of \u00a315,200-a-year Westminster school in central London, is retiring next year and wanted to transfer to a state school as a maths teacher.</p> <p>But the General Teaching Council for England said it had been unable to register the 57-year-old because he did not have \"qualified teacher status\" (QTS), which is generally obtained by completing a one-year postgraduate certificate in education.</p> <p>But teacher unions today said that the law prevented rogue teachers from entering schools and Mr Jones-Parry should take a one-year graduate training scheme. </p> <p>Since Margaret Thatcher was the education secretary in the 1970s all state school teachers must undertake recognised training and hold a degree. But the law was not applied to independent schools. </p> <p>Steve Sinnott, the general secretary of the NUT, said: \"There's no reason why Tristram Jones-Parry cannot take a one year Teach First course which is school-based in order to achieve qualified teacher status. In those circumstances it's difficult to see what all the fuss is about. </p> <p>\"Teaching in an independent school is very different from teaching in a state school. The classroom management skills, for instance, which are needed to ensure continuous learning in a class of 30 children are very different from those needed in a class of 15. Children's education is too important to leave it to chance that an person unqualified as a teacher is sufficiently capable.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It would be better if the government required that teachers in independent schools had to be graduates and professionally trained as is the case in state schools.\" </p> <p>The government scheme Teach First trains the top graduates to teach based on one-year supervised placements in schools. </p> <p>Chris Keates, the acting general secretary of National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said: \"The furore being generated about this teacher apparently not being able to work in state schools appears to be out of all proportion. \"If Mr Jones-Parry is committed to working in the state sector then there are routes by which his qualifications and competence can be assessed quickly to enable him to take up employment if he meets the required standard. I am sure the Teacher Training Agency will be able to point him in the right direction.\"</p> <p>The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said that it was a \"silly\" rule, which prevented MrJones-Parry from teaching and Carol Adams, the head of the General Teaching Council, said she would look into a fast-track scheme for other would-be state school teachers.</p>",

  "<p>Top City public relations firm Brunswick has become the target of militant Manchester United fans intent on blocking the American property billionaire Malcolm Glazer's \u00a3780m takeover bid for the club.</p> <p>Brunswick's London offices have become the focal point of a \"dirty tricks\" campaign and fans are threatening to launch a boycott of the firm's clients.</p> <p>The country's biggest financial PR agency is being plagued by unwanted deliveries, including a skip, taxis, pizzas and sandwiches. It has also been bombarded with offensive emails and telephone calls.</p> <p>Brunswick's clients are to be the next target. Influential supporters' group Shareholders United says it will publish Brunswick's corporate clients on its website and encourage fans to boycott them. The PR firm counts 24 of the country's FTSE 100, including the new owners of the Telegraph, the Barclay brothers, among its clients.</p> <p>Brunswick has taken immediate evasive action - taking down its own website and contact details from the internet and instructing switchboard operators not to divulge the identity of anyone working on the Manchester United bid or put calls directly through to the team.</p> <p>Around 18% of the Lancashire club is owned by fans with small stakes and many of them, including members of Shareholders United and the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association, are determined to derail Mr Glazer's bid.</p> <p>United fans have a successful track-record in using direct action tactics to impose their will.</p> <p>In 1998 they succeeded in preventing Rupert Murdoch from taking control of the club by persuading the government to refer BskyB's bid to the Monopoly and Mergers Commission. </p> <p>When Irish duo John Magnier and JP McManus - who remain United's majority shareholders - were reported to be considering a takeover last year, fans once again organised a campaign to derail a bid.</p> <p>\"Brunswick and Malcolm Glazer don't appreciate what they have taken on. And this is only week one. Our fans are beginning to sniff out clients of Brunswick and JP Morgan,\" Oliver Houston, the vice chairman of Shareholders United, told the Sunday Telegraph.</p> <p> Another fan group, Independent Manchester United Supporters Association, has pledged to fight Mr Glazer's bid.</p> <p>\"We sent Murdoch packing and gave Magnier and McManus a bloody nose,\" said Jules Spencer, chairman of the IMUSA.</p> <p>\"If Glazer wants a fight, we will give him one.

  "<p>Last week Online ran a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/online/story/0,3605,1320832,00.html\">feature about anonymous work bloggers</a> which looked at why and how people write about their workplaces. It made for interesting reading and the author, Jim McClellan, interviewed a number of anono-bloggers about what they do.</p> <p>Obviously, the interviews were condensed and cut to fit into the article as a whole, but since there are no limitations of space here on the web, we've decided to run the interviews in full on Onlineblog.</p> <p>The first interview is with <strong>Wrapstar</strong>, who writes <a href=\"http://callcentrediary.blogspot.com\">Call Centre Confidential</a>.</p> <p><strong>Online:</strong> When did you start your blog and why? Were other blogs, in particular other job/workplace blogs, an inspiration?</p> <p><strong>Wrapstar:</strong> I'd started to write a memoir of call centre life when I stumbled across blogging. Anthony Bourdain's book 'Kitchen Confidential' was my inspiration. He managed to make chopping onions appear the most compelling profession in the world. I wanted to do the same for call centres.</p> <p>Blogging is a form of micro-publishing. I've always produced magazines that have taken months to put together, at great expense and have been read by 50 people. Now, with the blog, it costs nothing, takes 5 minutes and is read by 500 people a day.</p> <p>The first entry was published February last year.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> What were you initially hoping to achieve with the blog? Has your blog (and what you write on it) changed as it's gone on?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> Call Centre Confidential has recently changed in tone as I've become more embittered. Initially, I was an invisible, participant observer of the absurdities of office life, nowadays it's a case of 'me against the world.'</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> What's reaction to it been like so far? Which kinds of entries are the most popular/draw the most comment?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> Reaction has been really positive. I expected some backlash following the 'Highly Commended' award from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/online/weblogs/story/0,14024,1108883,00.html\">Guardian's blog awards last year</a>, but readers increased and the response remained positive. Some of the entries in the comments are better than my posts!</p> <p>I'm always surprised and disappointed by which posts get the most response. I can spend hours composing a satirical masterpiece that gets ignored, while the 'pubes in the keyboard' entries that are knocked up in minutes are adored.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> You blog anonymously - if you blogged under your real name, how would your blog be different?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> I stay anonymous because I'd be found in a local canal if I got found out.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Does anyone from your work read your blog? If so, has anyone guessed that you're behind the blog?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> A handful of trusted colleagues know about the blog. I don't shout about it because I'd only have to put up with 'this is one for you' every five minutes. Besides, they have to put up with me all day, why would they want to listen to more of my bobbins?</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Do you see your blog as a purely personal thing - a way of dealing with the everyday frustrations at work - or does it have a more general, possibly political purpose - a kind of low-level whistle-blowing function - letting people know the reality of certain modern jobs?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> It's an entirely personal thing. A bit of my soul evaporates every day; this is is a means of topping it up.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Some people have suggested workplace blogs are a kind of rebellion against modern 'overwork' culture (in which people work longer and longer hours, in which work is seen as some sort of defining moral value, in which workers are under more and more surveillance and control, via audits, reviews etc). Do you agree?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> Are people in offices really over-worked? Generations of my family worked down a pit to feed their kids; these days people may worry 'does my boss rate me?', 'why does he have a bigger calculator than me?' and work through their lunch shuffling their in-box, but its to keep their kids in DVDs. Get a grip.</p> <p>Surveillance, control and auditing keep me busy, don't knock it.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Why do you think people read your blog? To find out 'the inside truth' about a particular area of modern life?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> Regular readers seem to enjoy following the narrative of the characters. People have their favourites. However, I suspect that most readers dip in and out. I suppose it does give people an idea of what life there is behind the phone.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Is what you write on your blog 'the truth' about your job? Or do you sometimes find yourself embellishing slightly, to make the blog more interesting. Bloggers often say that, though they set out to write about the everyday reality of their lives, they find that they've created a kind of alternate persona, which both is them and isn't, at the same time. Perhaps another way of coming at this is to say that blogs can be like stories and, as you build up momentum/audience, is there a temptation to spice things up slightly to keep people hooked?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> CCC is more honest than true. The things that happen do happen, but not neccessarily in the right order.</p> <p>The blog voice is different from my real voice. Many of the business-bull-shit sayings that I criticise in others, are things that I might say myself: I can 'push out the envelope' with the best of them.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Why are anonymous job blogs so popular now? Does it say something about modern work? Or does it say something about blogs and what people think they 're best at (eg personal accounts that take you inside a previously hidden world/correct big media assumptions etc)?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> I like to think that CCC has been an inspiration for some anonymous bloggers. The best blogs are focused, have a unity of voice and have pithy, unique insights.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> What do you hope to achieve with your blog? A way out of your current job? A publishing deal?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> I'd love to see Call Centre Confidential in print (I conceived it as a book) but I doubt anything will happen, after all I've been in a stopgap job for 12 years. I'm hardly a man of action.</p> <p>I'm in the throes of rewriting it as a one-man show to take it to Edinburgh next year. I'm not sure whether it will work it in a different format; my mate keeps reminding me of 'Porridge: The Movie'.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Is doing your blog still fun? Do you foresee a time when it might feel like another (unpaid) job? If that happened, what would you do?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> It's fun doing the blog. I'm worried about repeating myself. Call centres work in a cycle where the same pointless gubins rotates every year:</p> <p>'Let's multi-skill' 'Let's specialise' 'Let's multi-skill' Rinse and repeat.</p> <p>It won't go on for much longer.</p> <p>I've got an idea about writing a blog about my nocturnal activities, what happens 'after hours' - I may even spawn a whole new 'blog genre' watch this space!</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Do you feel a sense of responsibility to your readers? By which I mean I think a lot of people read job/workplace blogs and trust that they're telling it like it is about a particular job... Which is another way of saying - do you see yourself as a kind of journalist, with certain responsibilities as a result, or does the blog only have to please you/work for you?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> My motivation is to entertain my readers, I'm never going to let the truth get in the way, and I have made clear: when given the choice between the truth and the legend, I'll print the joke.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Could you explain your nom de blog?</p> <p><strong>WS:</strong> 'Wrap' time is call centre jargon for the time after a call when an adviser updates customer files.</p>",
  "<p>A few years ago, when French billionaire Fran\u00e7ois Pinault was searching for an original way to show a sculpture by the American conceptual artist Richard Serra that he had acquired, he decided to buy a ruined chapel in Brittany, dismantle it, transport it across France and rebuild it in the park outside his chateau. Local planning officials were aghast, but Pinault has never been one to allow bureaucracy, or logistics, to stand in his way. </p> <p>More recently, when Pinault was looking for a larger venue to exhibit his collection of contemporary art, he selected an abandoned island in Paris, three miles along the Seine from the Eiffel tower. There, on the site of a derelict car manufacturing plant, he aims to build a private museum to rival the Guggenheim in Bilbao or the Saatchi Gallery in London. </p> <p>For French socialists, the Renault factory that used to stand on the Ile Seguin was a symbol of the nation's glorious industrial past. But now, on Pinault's instructions, bulldozers have started to flatten it in preparation for its trans- formation into a monument to rapacious capitalism. On the island's western tip, six machines are scraping away at the factory's concrete ruins; later this year, construction will begin to replace the derelict shell with what could become Europe's most avant-garde contemporary art museum. </p> <p>There is much to be done before the project can be realised: the land must be decontaminated, bridges built and the island's banks shored up. But the foundation stone of the \u00a3150m concrete and glass building, designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando, should be laid next month. Officials are optimistic that the museum will be open by 2008. If all goes smoothly, the massive Renault placards that dominate the suburban landscape will be replaced with signs bearing the name Pinault. </p> <p>For 40 years, Pinault has been an energetic and successful entrepreneur, and now, aged 68, he is listed as France's third richest person. He has recently handed control of the running of his business to his son so that he can focus on his legacy. The creation of the Fran\u00e7ois Pinault Foundation for Contemporary Art will mark his transformation from the small-time timber merchant who left school, unqualified, at 16 into a leading member of France's establishment. </p> <p>He is keen to emphasise the philanthropic nature of the project: \"I want to share my passion for contemporary art with as many people as possible,\" he has written. \"I want the museum to be a place where people feel better at the exit than they did at the entrance.\" </p> <p>Pinault branched out from the timber industry by buying up newly bankrupt businesses in his native Brittany. He has subsequently accumulated an empire that embraces the Gucci Group, owner of brands such as Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney, the Printemps department stores, and the books and music chain Fnac. In passing, he has also bought himself a theatre, a right-wing magazine, a football club, a ski resort and one of the world's greatest red wines, Chteau Latour. </p> <p>As the thrill of collecting businesses waned, he moved into collecting art. In 1990 he bought Mondrian's 1925 Tableau Losangique for \u00a35.7m - a sum that, at the time, was twice the annual acquisition budget for the Pompidou Centre. Since then he has become France's most important private collector, with a personal collection of around 2,000 paintings, sculptures, videos and pieces of installation art. Such was his passion for art that in 1998 he decided to buy an auction house, Christie's, for \u00a3700m. </p> <p>Asked recently why he had focused on contemporary works, he replied that it was simply a question of economics. \"When I began to collect art, the masterpieces from the past were already in the museums and I didn't have the means to buy them.\" Never before has France witnessed such an extraordinary display of private ambition in the cultural sphere as Pinault's; there is no comparable tradition of private museums as there is in Britain and America. </p> <p>Yet there has been considerable hostility to the proposal from left- wing groups and historians who wanted the Renault factory's decrepit concrete hulk, known as Fortress Billancourt, restored and kept as a monument to French industrialism and the trade union movement. In the postwar era, the rights won by workers at Billancourt were shared by labourers across the country. In the spring of 1968, Jean-Paul Sartre balanced on an upturned dustbin here to lecture workers during the sit-in at the factory that triggered France's national strike. Poets and photographers glorified the site as a shrine to France's workers. The factory's role in the labour movement was so powerful that politicians warned: \"When Billancourt sneezes, France catches a cold.\" </p> <p>Pinault has tried to win over this group. \"This is a mythical place that is rich in history,\" he said. \"I want to share my love of contemporary art with the greatest number of people possible, not just an elite.\" </p> <p>Any regret at the flattening of the Renault building is dismissed as mere sentimentality by the foundation. \"The factory was extremely ugly and in very bad condition. It had to be knocked down,\" a spokeswoman says. Doubts about the wisdom of attempting a private project on this scale are also dismissed: \"Pinault has a pharoanic vision and he wants to have total freedom to do what he wants with the building, which is why no state support is being solicited.\" Pinault is nevertheless a member of President Jacques Chirac's most intimate inner circle, and their long-standing personal friendship suggests that the government will look fondly on the project, even if this support is not translated immediately into financial help. </p> <p>To those who question whether Paris needs another modern art museum, in addition to the Pompidou Centre and the ultra-modern Palais de Tokyo, which opened in 2002, the response is firm: the Pinault Foundation will be a contemporary art museum that will supplement both these state-funded enterprises. Former Pompidou Centre director Jean-Jacques Aillagon, who was France's minister for culture until earlier this year, is now working for Pinault. </p> <p>\"The Palais de Tokyo has good exhibitions of contemporary art, but no permanent collection,\" he says. \"The Pompidou centre has a good collection of modern art, but doesn't have enough space to show it all and it isn't so strong in the field of contemporary art. This will fill the gap in a very useful fashion. </p> <p>\"There won't be a spirit of violent competition between the museums, as if they were out to destroy each other. There will be some positive rivalry, but I think there will also be loans between the two museums.\" </p> <p>There is considerable mystery about the precise content of Pinault's collection. He refuses to divulge the full list - and the uncertainty has been heightened by his fondness for swiftly reselling new purchases - but the collection is known to centre on modern art from the second half of the 20th century and contemporary artists, containing works by Mir\u00f3, Pollock, Rothko, Modigliani, Brancusi and Warhol as well as Picasso and Gauguin. Pinault has a passion for the Young British Artists, and owns works by Damien Hirst and Tracy Emin. He is also enthusiastic about American contemporary artists, and the museum's debut exhibition is scheduled to be the first Jeff Koons retrospective. </p> <p>With some reluctance, the foundation concedes that very few French contemporary artists are represented. \"He doesn't think they're any good,\" one official whispers. </p> <p>Despite the urban chic endowed on the site by its industrial roots, the location may pose a problem. Over 30 minutes from the centre of Paris, at the last station on the tube line, and well beyond the range of standard sight-seeing routes, it will have to entice tourists to stray this far out of the city centre. The local authorities have yet to decide what will be built on the remaining two-thirds of the island. The Pinault Foundation hopes that other cultural and scientific institutions will be grow up there, transforming the island into a creative centre. </p> <p>Since the Renault factory's closure in 1992, the deserted island has become known as the Titanic of the Seine. At the foundation, officials are confident that Ando's new building - itself reminiscent of an ocean-cruiser about to set sail down the river - will finally secure the area's revival.</p>",

  "<p>We've had a decade of in-yer-face, blood-and-sperm drama. But, intriguingly, these two tantalising new pieces in the Royal Court's young playwrights season both have middle-class settings and greet apocalypse and disaster with wry humour. Are we into a new era of comic despair?</p> <p>Clare Pollard's The Weather puts me in mind of Bu\u00f1uel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, in that a family disintegrates against a background of social anarchy. In the outside world the economy collapses, bombs explode in shopping malls and the weather is unpredictably violent.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in one particular domestic kitchen, an angry daughter confronts her manic mum and harassed dad as poltergeists send toasters whizzing through the air and scrawl obscenities on the walls.</p> <p>Pollard's point seems to be that the nuclear family is doomed and curiously oblivious to external chaos - so nothing very new there then. But, as a published poet, Pollard has a good ear for language and, as an aspiring dramatist, she wittily exploits the possibilities of theatre. Not since Blithe Spirit have we seen a play in which domestic objects acquire such dynamic life.</p> <p>My only reservation about Ramin Gray's production is that it is too feverish from the start and, in particular, gives Helen Schlesinger as the loopy lush of a mum too much rope: the play would be even sharper if disaster sprang from recognisable normality.</p> <p>Oddly enough, Gray gets the tone precisely right in Robin French's Bear Hug: a very funny NF Simpson-like shortie about a middle-class mum and dad greeting their son's transformation into a bear with persevering optimism. Jonathan Coy exudes superb sobriety as the father who, speaking of his ursine son's driving, acknowledges that \"his hill starts are all over the place\". And Helen Schlesinger treats the fact that the bear has savaged her hands and reduced them to bleeding stumps as a minor inconvenience. \"I agree, it is wayward,\" says her husband.</p> <p>What makes the play so refreshing, however, is not just its savage humour but its suggestion that youthful alienation, even at its most extreme, is often greeted with dogged parental hope. </p> <p><strong>&amp;#183</strong> Until Saturday (Bear Hug)/ October 30 (The Weather).

  "The beautiful Seniors, the toast of London society in 1858, will meet again this week for the first time in more than a century. <p>Mrs Jeanie Senior has made regular outings. Her sister-in-law, Minnie, had retired completely from society and had not appeared in public since 1881 - until she was traced last year to a suburban living room in Wimbledon.</p> <p>The portraits, sedate Minnie walking through a garden and Jeanie bending to water flowers, awed the critics when they were exhibited together by the artist GF Watts at the Royal Academy in 1858.</p> <p>They meet again in an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, intended to help restore the reputation of a giant of Victorian art, judged by Henry James to be \"the first portrait painter in England\".</p> <p>He was already seen as old-fashioned when he died in 1904, and slid into obscurity for most of the 20th century.</p> <p>The exhibition is part of a renaissance marking the centenary of his death. There's an exhibition at the Watts Gallery at Compton in Surrey; a biography due out this month; huge allegorical paintings on display at Tate Britain; small exhibitions at the Royal Academy and Leighton House; and the portrait gallery exhibition of the works he valued least.</p> <p>\"People will be astonished at just how gorgeous these portraits are, the sheer richness and beauty of the colour, their glamour, and the scale and ambition of the compositions,\" curator Barbara Bryant said.</p> <p>Watts moaned about the need to earn money by painting portraits, which distracted him from his true work: the gloomy allegories, histories and symbolist paintings which are now the hardest to love.</p> <p>Ms Bryant thinks he pro-tested too much. \"You can't mistake, looking at these portraits, the enthusiasm, the freshness, and the constant experiment with which they are painted.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> GF Watts Portraits, Fame &amp; Beauty in Victorian Society, National Portrait Gallery, October 14 - January 9</p>",
  "<p>A year ago Elvis Costello was being written off for North, an album of (gulp) love songs. It's typical of his unpredictability that he has blasted back with The Delivery Man - an album for people who grew up thinking Costello was a punk - and this sole UK appearance in Britain's most rock'n'roll venue.</p> <p>As Costello stands lashing out song after song with barely a pause, he looks less like the musical adventurer who also released a classical album last month than the 1977 model. In those days he was a bundle of fidgety bile. Now 50, in a purple suit that looks a size too small, he is still so edgy he must get all manner of trouble at customs.</p> <p>The set blends The Delivery Man with classics, such as Radio Radio and High Fidelity, that fit with the new record's scatter-gun energy. Costello hurls in lost gems such as Blame It on Cain, the second B-side of Watching the Detectives, and trashes the planned set list as he responds to the crowd's mood.</p> <p>A spontaneous moment is the night's funniest, as he introduces the Darwinesque Monkey to a Man by suggesting: \"We should never... in any country... vote for anybody who is a disgrace to the theory of evolution.\"</p> <p>A spectacular Shipbuilding equally mocks any notion that his political fire has gone out. With every line sung by the crowd, the Falklands-inspired song feels like a succession of hammer blows against any case for war.</p> <p>The blistering energy is emphasised by occasional gentler numbers, including the eerie Country Darkness and a rapturously received Good Year for the Roses. The night divides into a punky hour-long blast and another hour of encores, as Costello rediscovers his common touch and rock'n'roll heart.</p>",
  "The person arrested in connection with the murder of a 14-year-old schoolgirl in Nottingham on Saturday has been released without charge, a police spokeswoman confirmed today. <p>Police made the arrest after Danielle Beccan was shot only yards from her home in the early hours of Saturday morning as she returned from a fairground with friends. </p> <p>Officers say they are baffled as to why Danielle or her friends might have been targeted by the gunmen, although witnesses said they believed the gunmen had been targeting one of the boys she was with.</p> <p>\"She was an innocent 14-year-old-girl, and I think we have to concentrate on the fact that this was a child who has been senselessly shot and killed,\" Sue Fish, the Nottinghamshire Assistant Chief Constable, said.</p> <p>Danielle's friends and relatives have been leaving dozens of messages and floral tributes at the spot where she was killed. A simple message from her mother, Paula Platt, which was attached to a toy dog, read: \"We will miss you always. Our hearts are broken.\" </p> <p>Her grandfather, Alvin, spoke tearfully of his \"friendly, easygoing\" granddaughter. \"She was just easygoing. She was a nice girl,\" he said. \"She was popular. All the family are cut up about it.\" </p> <p>Police said they had spoken to a number of Danielle's friends, and believed another group of around 30 youngsters had been in the area at the time and could help trace the girl's killers. </p> <p>\"We were trying to identify everybody who was with Danielle at Goose Fair,\" Assistant Chief Constable Fish said. </p> <p>\"I am now confident that we have traced most of this group. We now want to trace people in another group just a few hundred yards away from where she was shot. It is a very strong possibility that these people were witnesses. </p> <p>\"We need to know the motive [for the murder]. We need to know whether it was a case of mistaken identity.\" </p> <p>Superintendent Dave Colbeck, of Nottinghamshire police, said officers had received intelligence that there could be trouble at the annual Goose Fair. Measures had been put in place to combat any problems.</p>",
  "When I said there may be some surprises at the Labour conference, I didn't think that Tony Blair was about to grab the headlines with his announcement of imminent heart surgery and his intention to continue for another full term as prime minister. Poor Gordon Brown is starting to look like Prince Charles: permanently in waiting for anointment as our leader. <p>The \"big speech\" was billed as a difficult one for Blair: he needed to point up Labour's achievements in a period overshadowed by the war in Iraq and his preoccupation with it; give us all a reason for sticking with Labour for a third term; and achieve a reconciliation with his party and the country which would leave us all reassured that he was \"the straight kind of guy\" we have supported in the past.</p> <p>On the first point, he did tolerably well. In most domestic policy areas I'm satisfied that life under Labour has been better than it would have been under the Tories - although I think Brown deserves more of the credit for that than Blair. Similarly, no one would disagree with the priorities he outlined in the new 10-point plan, although I'm still left with the impression that we ought to have made better progress than we have achieved to date. I do not think the government has been sufficiently focused on delivery and the need for planning, support and follow-through to ensure that the organisations targeted for additional finance make best use of it.</p> <p>And so to Iraq. I listened carefully to Blair's acceptance that public perceptions of him were a problem for the party; his admission that the intelligence on weapons of mass destruction had been wrong; and his refusal to apologise for removing Saddam. Somewhere in there was his statement that he was not infallible and that he would work on the Middle East issue.</p> <p>I was left with the impression that here was a man who, over several years, had grudgingly given way with a series of admissions once faced with irrefutable proof. Worse still, not only was there no apology for what he had done but Blair did not give me any confidence that we would not embark on the next ill-omened, foreign adventure that President Bush came up with. </p> <p>Our PM seems inexplicably entwined in a friendship with one of the most rightwing presidents of the United States, with no real influence over him and to the detriment of this country. Blair has implored us to \"move on\" from here and concentrate on working together to put Iraq back together again. While I agree we can't walk out of Iraq now, I can't forget who got us into this mess, Tony. </p> <p>Meanwhile the Tory conference themes seem to be trust, delivery and accountability. So far, so good - the focus groups have done their work and my stereotype has been identified somewhere - I'm ready to have my deepest fears and desires pandered to and be reassured that the Tories have just the political medicine I need.</p> <p>Michael Howard was impressive; I could see why the consensus of opinion is that he's done a good job in pulling the party together since Ian Duncan-Smith. His delivery was succinct and powerful, with less of the more ethereal language Tony Blair is prone to. Howard's personal statement at the end of his speech was just right, clearly planned for a certain effect but not manufactured.</p> <p>All in all, he came across as prime ministerial material, honest and sincere in what he believed in and determined to do his best to deliver his vision of Britain. My problem is that I don't like his vision. While I can understand the political quandary he's in - as to whether to see off the UK Independence party's inroads into traditional Tory support by moving to the right or responding to the Liberal Democrats' ability to mop up the anti-Labour vote by moving to the centre, a diet of more of the same doesn't cut the mustard with me. A move to the centre looks more promising but I don't think that's where Mr Howard's political sympathies lie.</p> <p>I'm not overly bothered by the European constitution - I'm sure it will need some tweaking here and there but it's clear that with increased membership, changes in how the EU is run are essential. The Tories' attitude to law and order also makes me nervous but, given David Blunkett's regime, I now can't see the difference between the two.</p> <p> Finally, their great push for deregulation. Like many, I suspect, I remember the early 1980s when Thatcherism was rampant and the greed-culture was the foundation of society. I equate that with an abrogation of responsibility and I strongly believe that government has a duty to regulate where appropriate, to protect us from untrammelled market forces who are seldom motivated by the common good. Dangling deregulation as the answer to all our prayers appeals only to the anarchist in all of us.</p>",
  "Virtually every area of humanistic scholarship and artistic activity in the latter part of the 20th century felt the influence of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida, who has died aged 74 from pancreatic cancer. <p>\"Deconstruction\", the word he transformed from a rare French term to a common expression in many languages, became part of the vocabulary not only of philosophers and literary theorists but also of architects, theologians, artists, political theorists, educationists, music critics, filmmakers, lawyers and historians. Resistance to his thinking, too, was widespread and sometimes bitter, as it challenged academic norms and, sometimes, common sense. </p> <p>Derrida's name has probably been mentioned more frequently in books, journals, lectures, and common-room conversations during the last 30 years than that of any other living thinker. He was the subject of films, cartoons and at least one rock song, by Scritti Politi; he generated both adulatory and vituperative journalism; and he wrote some of the most formidably difficult philosophical works of his time. If he is remembered in future centuries, it is likely to be for contributions to our understanding of language, meaning, identity, ethical decisions and aesthetic values. </p> <p>Derrida's starting point was his rejection of a common model of knowledge and language, according to which understanding something requires acquaintance with its meaning, ideally a kind of acquaintance in which this meaning is directly present to consciousness. For him, this model involved \"the myth of presence\", the supposition that we gain our best understanding of something when it - and it alone - is present to consciousness. </p> <p>He argued that understanding something requires a grasp of the ways in which it relates to other things, and a capacity to recognise it on other occasions and in different contexts - which can never be exhaustively predicted. He coined the term \"differance\" ( diff\u00e9rance in French, combining the meanings of difference and deferral) to characterise these aspects of understanding, and proposed that differance is the ur-phenomenon lying at the heart of language and thought, at work in all meaningful activities in a necessarily elusive and provisional way. </p> <p>The demonstration that this is so largely constituted the work of deconstruction, in which writers who laid claim to purity or transparency or universality - and this would include most of the significant figures in the philosophical tradition - could be shown, by close and careful reading, to be undoing those very claims in the act of making them by their implicit recognition of the ongoing work of differance. </p> <p>For example, in an early work on the German phenomenologist Edmund Husserl, La voix et le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne (Speech And Phenomena, 1967), Derrida argued that the philosophical emphasis on the \"living present\" concealed a dependence on the idea of death: I cannot use a sign - a word or a sentence, say - without implying that it pre-exists me and will outlive me. \"I am\" means \"I am mortal.\" </p> <p>These readings were not done in a spirit of one-upmanship or negative criticism; Derrida claimed to love everything he deconstructed. For him, it was a mark of the greatness of Plato, Rousseau, Hegel or the Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas that their texts moved beyond what they straightforwardly asserted. This affirmative attitude became particularly visible when he was discussing literary works, where he often found vivid enactments of his arguments. </p> <p>Derrida moved easily among French, English and German writers, and his favourites included James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 and Paul Celan. Although his name is often coupled with the term \"postmodernism\" (sometimes with a suggestion of moral relativism), his allegiance was much more to the strenuous aesthetic experiments of the modernist writers. For him, the fact that moral values cannot be expressed as simple rules of conduct increased, rather than decreased, the importance of our ethical responsibilities. </p> <p>The warmest reception of his work occurred in university literature departments, where it was frequently studied alongside the writing of other poststructuralists, notably Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, Roland Barthes and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous. </p> <p>Derrida's style was as upsetting to traditional philosophers as were his arguments. This was an important element of his famous debate in the 1970s with the American philosopher John Searle concerning the significance of JL Austin's speech-act theory, which attempted to distinguish between different kinds of utterance. While praising Austin, Derrida criticised him for giving too much priority to \"serious\" uses of language, and not recognising the importance of the ways in which the same speech-acts are used in humour, play-acting, teaching, citation and on other \"non-serious\" occasions. </p> <p>Searle criticised Derrida for misrepresenting Austin (which in some respects he did), but the American, not appreciating the function of Derrida's playful style, equally misrepresented the Frenchman, who responded by writing an even more outrageous rejoinder. What might have been a valuable dialogue between Derrida and analytical philosophy of language led nowhere. </p> <p>In fact, Derrida had several styles, ranging from the technical analysis of Greek terminology, through highly personal meditations to an exuberant sporting with language. He could be a highly comic writer - and an equally comic speaker, with an impeccable sense of timing - even when the issues were of the utmost gravity. This affront to convention was not born of a desire to shock; it was part of a strategy of undermining the categories - including the distinction between the serious and the non-serious - that had long dominated philosophical language. (Exceptions, such as Nietzsche, were given due credit.) Derrida's writing is strange and difficult because it has to be: to test the limits of what can be thought is to test the limits of what can be articulated. </p> <p>Imitations of the Derridean style seldom succeed, and it is not surprising that a caricature version of Derrida emerged. But this flamboyantly self-regarding figure, dismissing the search for truth, declaring historical knowledge to be impossible, denying that there is anything beyond language - and doing all this in a relentless series of puns and neologisms - bore no resemblance to the person himself. He was a cautious thinker, frequently pointing out the unavoidable simplifications in what he was saying; he always insisted on philosophical and linguistic rigour (even if his understanding of what constituted rigour differed from the traditional one); and he respected truth and historical accuracy in a very traditional manner. </p> <p>He was a man of remarkable modesty and generosity, quite without self-importance. Anyone who attended one of the many conferences dedicated to his work observed how conscientiously he listened to every paper (whether by a famous thinker or a graduate student), took careful notes, and asked polite but searching questions. Unknown academics sending manuscripts would receive handwritten (which sometimes meant virtually undecipherable) comments in response, always written in a positive spirit. </p> <p>Jackie Derrida - he later adopted a more \"correct\" French version of his first name - was born in El-Biar, near Algiers, into an indigenous Jewish family. He attended local primary schools and, in 1941, entered the nearby lyc\u00e9e, already subject to anti-semitic Vichy laws. The following year, he was expelled as a Jew, and was not able to recommence regular schooling until 1944. Even then, he did not settle down; he dreamed of being a professional footballer and failed the baccalaur\u00e9at in 1947. These were years of intense reading, however, including Rousseau, Nietzsche and Paul Val\u00e9ry. </p> <p>Moving through two more lyc\u00e9es in Algiers, Derrida was introduced to the two great precursors in 20th-century French philosophy, with whom, oddly perhaps, he never engaged at any length in print, Bergson and Sartre; he was more taken by his discovery of Kierkegaard and Heidegger. He passed the bac in 1948 and set his sights, thanks to a chance radio programme, on the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, the leading French institute for literature and philosophy. </p> <p>The route lay via two years of preparatory classes at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-grand in Paris, although it took Derrida longer than this as he suffered physically and psychologically in the new environment (it was the first time he had been out of Algeria). At his third attempt, in 1952, he was admitted to the \u00c9cole Normale, where, after faltering again, he finally passed the agr\u00e9gation in 1956. He also made some important friends, including Louis Althusser, Foucault and the psychoanalyst Marguerite Aucouturier, whom he married in 1957. </p> <p>After a year's visit to Harvard University and a spell of military service, Derrida took his first teaching job, at a lyc\u00e9e in Le Mans. He then taught at the Sorbonne for four years, before moving to the position he was to occupy until 1984: mitre-assistant at the \u00c9cole Normale. There, his seminars - written every year on a fresh topic - became Parisian institutions. His first publication (1962) was a very long introduction to his translation of a short essay by Husserl on The Origin Of Geometry. It is striking that, despite the mathematical subject-matter of this work, Derrida confidently set out in it many of the themes that were to recur later, including his conception of differance. </p> <p>The event that projected him into the international limelight was a conference at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1966, where the relatively unknown (but incontrovertibly glamorous) young philosopher upstaged the likes of Lacan and Jean Hyppolite. This was to be the start of a long relationship with English departments in the US, where he was made more welcome than anywhere else in the world. (The French academic establishment never took him to its heart, and academic philosophers everywhere were generally uncomprehending.) </p> <p>Derrida's annus mirabilis was 1967, which saw the publication of three extraordinary books. For philosophers, it is in La voix et le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne that Derrida makes, or fails to make, his case, arguing through a careful critical reading of another text by Husserl, for the fundamental role of differance in language and thought. </p> <p>In L'Ecriture et la diff\u00e9rence (Writing And Difference), he brought together essays in which he began to develop his position in the context of debates about psychoanalysis, the human sciences and ethics. But it was De la grammatologie (Of Grammatology) that created the greatest stir. After an introductory discussion in which he argued that \"grammatology\", the theory of written signs, can point the way to an understanding of language freed from the myth of presence and open to the work of differance, he entered upon a brilliant deconstruction of the accounts of language given by Saussure, L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Rousseau and others. </p> <p>Derrida gives most attention to Rousseau, and connects the priority Rousseau gives to speech over writing with the priority he gives to nature over culture, to melody over harmony, and to coitus over masturbation. Derrida noted that, in each case, Rousseau uses the word \"supplement\" to designate the relationship between the second term and the first. The word suggests that the second term is inessential, merely adding to the first term, which is primary, full, self-sufficient. </p> <p>Yet a secondary meaning of the word \"supplement\" seemed to Derrida to be playing around all Rousseau's uses of it: as the supplement to a dictionary supplies its missing terms, so writing, culture, harmony and masturbation all make up for deficiencies in what was supposed to be the perfect and complete entity to which they are in an ancillary relation. </p> <p>The second entity, not quite under the author's control, comes to set the terms which make possible the first entity. \"Supplementarity\", thus understood, is a manifestation of differance; and other manifestations are explored in Derrida's discussions of the Greek terms pharmakon (both medicine and poison) and hymen (both separation and marriage) in his next major work La Diss\u00e9mination (Dissemination, 1972). </p> <p>Although Derrida was active in the protests of 1968, he had reservations about the allegiance to the Communist party of many of his associates. In 1974, he founded the Groupe De Recherche Sur L'enseignement Philoso- phique, dedicated to improving the teaching of philosophy in schools. By now, he was receiving invitations from many institutions, and important friendships were established on these travels. The American connection blossomed in the 1970s, when he began an annual visit to Johns Hopkins and then to Yale, where he worked closely with J Hillis Miller and Paul de Man (the kernel of what came to be known as the Yale school of deconstruction). </p> <p>In 1980, Derrida defended a doctoral thesis at the Sorbonne, based on his publications, and, that same year, he was the focus of a 10-day Cerisy-la-Salle conference organised by two friends whose work was to remain in close touch with his, Jean-Luc Nancy and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe. The following year, there took place an event that was to haunt him for the rest of his life: returning from a clandestine seminar in Prague, he was arrested on false drugs charges and imprisoned. His release was secured after a protest by the French government. </p> <p>In order to encourage developments in philosophy outside the traditional canons, Derrida contributed to the establishment of the Coll\u00e8ge International de Philosophie, of which he became the first director in 1983. That same year, he also participated in the creation of an anti-apartheid foundation and a writers' committee for Nelson Mandela. In 1984, he was elected to the \u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales as director of studies. As at the \u00c9cole Normale, he gave an annual seminar, keeping it up after retirement in 1998, although with fewer sessions. </p> <p>His friend Hillis Miller moved from Yale to the University of Irvine, California, in 1986, and Derrida switched allegiance at the same time, beginning an annual spring visitthat continued until 2003. He also began a regular short autumn visit to New York, as the guest of New York University, the New School and the Cardozo School of Law. </p> <p>The discovery, in 1987, of his friend de Man's collaborationist wartime journalism was a personal blow to Derrida. At the Alabama University conference at which the articles were made public, he gave an extraordinarily moving speech expressing the complex emotions provoked by the disclosure. Around the same time, more evidence about Heidegger's involvement with the Nazi party emerged, and Derrida was obliged to make it clear that, although he owed more to Heidegger than to any other philosopher, his adherence was far from uncritical. </p> <p>Derrida's honorary Cambridge degree, awarded in 1992, provoked a fierce debate and an outbreak of caricaturing, as well as spirited defences. In the early part of his career, he did not allow photographs of himself to be published, but such a simplistic opposition between the public and the private could not survive his philosophical scrutiny, and soon his image became familiar. The 2002 film Jacques Derrida, by Amy Ziering Kofman, entertainingly explored this questionable opposition, and gave a wider glimpse of its subject's wicked sense of humour. </p> <p> D errida published some 70 books and countless articles. The most important volumes include Glas (1974), which staged a confrontation between Hegel and Genet by means of an ingenious page-layout; La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 en peinture (The Truth In Painting, 1978), on visual art and attempts to theorise about it; La carte postale (The Post Card, 1987), an exploration of psychoanalytic themes through a fictional series of postcards to an unidentified addressee; and two large-scale collections of essays, Psych\u00e9: inventions de l'autre (1987), on a wide range of topics, and Du droit \u00e0 la philosophie (1990), in which the institutional situation of philosophy is addressed. </p> <p>In 1993 Derrida's longstanding admiration for Marx was given full elaboration in a controversial study, Spectres de Marx (Spectres Of Marx). Always a man of the left, he felt able to write this book only when Soviet communism had collapsed, as his espousal of Marx was then, he said, less likely to be misunderstood. </p> <p>Derrida's later writings were increasingly concerned with ethical and political issues, including religion (both Judaism and Christianity), the question of capital punishment (to which he was vigorously opposed), and the place of animals in the tradition of western philosophy. </p> <p>He and Marguerite continued to live happily in an unpretentious house in an unremarkable Parisian suburb. But he was a man with many anxieties, and death was a constant preoccupation, both philosophically and personally. Over the years, he delivered a series of moving eulogies, a collection of which was published in 2001 as The Work Of Mourning, but whose French title is even more apt: Chaque fois unique, la fin du monde (Each time unique, the end of the world). </p> <p>He is survived by his wife and their sons Pierre and Jean, and a son, Daniel, by the philosopher Sylviane Agacinski. </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Jacques (Jackie) Derrida, philosopher, born July 15 1930; died October 8 2004</p>",
  "<p>Rachel Roxburgh has a strange job title: head of running. Does this mean she runs around a lot? Or does she run things, or perhaps check whether machinery is running properly? </p> <p>In fact, Roxburgh is head of running at Cancer Research UK because she organises the spectacular fun runs that have seen a phenomenal 400,000 women participate in the charity's Race for Life events in this year alone, raising \u00a325m between them. </p> <p>The running operation is part of the National Events department at Cancer Research, Britain's biggest charity. Now Roxburgh - who also organises sponsored treks in such destinations as the Great Wall of China and Mount Kilimanjaro - is organising 10km runs for men and women in the grounds of Leeds Castle, Blenheim Palace and other stately homes. </p> <p>Roxburgh says: \"We reach out to a huge audience. It's very exciting and dynamic.\" Her team handles everything from finding and setting up the venues for the runs to thinking about the PR and marketing aspects - how the event will get the charity's message across. </p> <p>Roxburgh has worked for Cancer Research for the past 11 years. She fell into this field after a work placement at Help the Aged's special events department uncovered a side to fundraising she had never imagined. \"I had a standard idea of what charities were like: coffee mornings, twinsets and pearls,\" she says. \"But I was at film premieres. Princess Diana was our patron and I met her four times.\" </p> <p>Now, she says, one of the rewards of the job is meeting the supporters whose efforts raise such a lot of cash. She was there to greet cancer survivor Findlay Young as he completed the last of four gruelling half-marathons in 24 hours. \"Just seeing his expression as he was running towards the finishing line was the most extraordinary moment for me - tears streaming down his face and arms outstretched,\" she recalls. </p> <p>It is this link between the amazing contribution of volunteers such as Young and professionals such as Roxburgh that is crucial, says Lindsay Boswell, chief executive of the Institute of Fundraising. \"The thing that is really unique about the profession is its main public face is a vast army of volunteers, who are underpinned by a smaller professional, dedicated and sophisticated corps of employed individuals,\" he says. </p> <p>The professionals have a wide range of skills from marketing expertise to the ability to recognise the skills and attributes of others and work out who is best placed to \"do the ask\" - actually requesting donations. </p> <p>Lots of fundraisers have \"crossed over\" from the commercial world into the charity sector, Boswell says. \"They use their skills to make a difference rather than flog financial services.\" </p> <p>Stephen George, director of community appeals at NSPCC, does deal with more traditional fundraising. That reflects the heritage of the charity, which was formed as a local group in Liverpool. The professional fundraisers bring the NSPCC's army of volunteers together and offer support to local groups, keeping them in touch with the charity's activity and its campaigns - \"making sure the direction of the society and what we're doing for children is connected on the ground so the supporters feel inspired\", George says. He sums it up as \"a complex set of relationships in a marketing environment\". </p> <p>Anthony Baumann, who heads the 20-strong fundraising team at the RSPCA, says that in big charities, fundraising is a large-scale marketing effort - but with far fewer resources than a commercial marketing department would have. The RSPCA raises money from direct marketing campaigns that have recruited 750,000 \"live donors\" and from legacies, an important source for many charities. </p> <p>But though the resources may be scarce, the atmosphere is different to the cut-throat commercial world too. \"Charities are unbelievably friendly to each other,\" he says. \"Most are not in competition ... so we talk to each other. It's an exciting place to work as a marketeer - you may not make top whack, but you can make a difference.\" </p> <p>Fundraising is not all about house hold-name charities, however. Alison Woolley is a senior development manager at University College London, which last week launched a \u00a3300m fundraising campaign, thought to be the biggest ever university appeal in Britain. Rather than the general public, UCL is targeting wealthy individuals, many from a database of 60,000 or so former students. \"Major gift fundraising is not standing on street corners with a tin,\" Woolley says. </p> <p>Her role involves matching possible donors to a cause that will interest them - perhaps a particular area of the university's research. This involves liaising with the academic staff to find out what they are doing and researching potential donors. \"We have three people in a research team whose job it is to find out about people, their interests and motivations,\" she says. </p> <p>Asking for money is the crucial bit, of course, but Woolley says donors are often pleased to be approached. \"They say how amazing it is to be able to help with something so important.\" </p> <p>For many fundraisers, bringing together the donor and the cause provides their job satisfaction. Roxburgh also points to the variety of the work and the people she meets. \"I don't want each day to be the same - and it's not.\"</p>",
  "<p>On a crisp and sunlit morning in Surrey, with the languid buzz of an old lawnmower echoing around his enormous garden, Peter Alliss purrs contentedly. \"It's a glorious day,\" he says with the mellifluous hum of a 73-year-old golfer who believes he is seeing England at its very finest. As Alliss walks his three dogs and waves to his two gardeners, the setting seems strangely timeless. Yet, even here, nothing lasts forever. Winter is on its way. </p> <p>Introducing me to his \"bitch\" Buffy, it appears for one terrifying moment as if Alliss is about to parody gangsta-rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard, or pay homage to a foxy young Vampire Slayer, in a desperate attempt to fight the increasingly insistent accusation that he is a blinkered old fogey holding back modern broadcasting. Alliss, however, prefers to confront a more enduring problem in this little corner of England. </p> <p>\"As they're bitches,\" he muses while pointing to his gun dogs, \"they pee all over the place and that burns up the lawn. That's why the chaps over there keep mowing away. It's a constant battle, but they're wonderful hounds . . .\" </p> <p>Alliss, with a photographer to please and a new book to promote, is still enough of an old pro to slip into some serious nose-to-nose action with the lovely Buffy. \"This could make you famous,\" he croons, as if directing one of his conversational commentaries to a young buck standing over a six-footer on the last green rather than his exuberant pooch. </p> <p>It is the kind of velvety chit-chat which has made Alliss the \"voice of golf\" for the past 35 years. And, though two other broadcasting icons, Des Lynam and Barry Davies, have retired from our television screens in recent months, Alliss is about to sign a new three-year contract as the BBC's premier golf commentator. It is an appointment which will be celebrated in clubhouses from St Andrews to Westward Ho as a nostalgic tie to a lost era - but elsewhere it will be lamented by those both in and outside the game who regard Alliss as a pompous archetype of golf's most reactionary traditions. </p> <p>\"Journalists can't resist these snidey little comments,\" he suggests accurately. \"I'm either too old or the person which 20% of the population would most like to disappear. Or they dredge up the terrible faux pas I made at the Masters this year. It was all so silly. I'd been watching [Phil] Mickelson for four hours and knew exactly what was happening. But as he holed the winning putt a voice in my ear said, 'It's not over yet!' And instinctively I said the same words. But the producer wasn't talking about a play-off. He was telling the technicians we had to go into the Butler Cabin and film the presentation. I knew instantly I'd made a mistake but everyone still insisted on making a big deal out of it.\" </p> <p>Though Alliss places himself alongside Richie Benaud in the last bastion of traditional sports commentary, there is little real comparison between the two men. Benaud impressionists focus on the dry Aussie timbre in his voice and the lizard-like flick of his tongue, while his reputation within cricket remains impregnable. Alliss is different. Revered by those who remember how, almost single-handedly, he helped transform golf into a prime-time television sport, his amiable commentary also attracts criticism for its lack of technical description or analytical rigour. </p> <p>\"It's difficult to find adequate replacements,\" Alliss insists. \"It's the same with Benaud. People say, 'Oh, he's getting too old', but he knows everything about cricket. I think I describe the nuances of golf and somebody young and brash might not offer that. So I hope I'll be around for a while yet to keep pointing out those nuances and saying out loud what I think might be wrong.\" </p> <p>The Daily Telegraph suggests of Alliss that, \"when it comes to painting a picture with words, he's nothing short of Rembrandt\". It is, though, a lame old master who once described Shigeki Maruyama as \"the wily Oriental\". </p> <p>Alliss looks briefly mortified. \"That's my own ignorance. I thought 'wily' meant clever or street-smart. I've since looked up the dictionary definition of 'wily' and it basically means 'sneaky'. I meant it in a complimentary way but it came out wrong. So a lot of journalists think I'm Colonel Blimp but it's just not true. </p> <p>\"There's one particular fellow [the former Guardian journalist] Matthew Norman, who writes for the Evening Standard. He doesn't care for me and he writes these pieces where he has me driving a Lexus and wearing gloves. But I've never owned a Lexus or used driving gloves. I did think of writing to him and asking him to lunch - just to find out exactly why he's got this bee in his bonnet about me.\" </p> <p>Alliss, naturally, drives a Bentley rather than a Lexus. He seems mystified to hear that his political views may be a more compelling reason for the loathing he attracts alongside the adoration of middle England. My eyes glaze during Alliss'senthusiastic praise for the death penalty and plea to increase the prison population four times over, but there is one moment when the waffle seems almost shocking in its stark crudity. Pinpointing the exact time \"it all went wrong\" and darkness descended over the country, Alliss is emphatic: \"There's no doubt - and this is well-recorded - the freedom women felt when they got the contraceptive pill took the fear away from illegitimate relationships.\" </p> <p>I must look as if I am about to kick in Alliss's widescreen television - which is tuned silently to the golf on Sky - because he hesitates before he chuckles. \"Yes, I know. I do sound like Colonel Blimp here. But when I was a boy, that was the greatest contraceptive: getting VD or putting a girl in the family way. If you did that, you had to marry her, there were no two ways about it. You made your bed, now you lie in it. The other turning point was the end of National Service. But that's gone. You'd have to have a revolution to bring it back.\" </p> <p>And yet, in an act of personal conviction which is far more intriguing than his right-wing rhetoric, Alliss then reveals why he turned down an OBE in 1993. </p> <p>\"I suppose it's a silly reason but I remember people coming back from the war. When they heard an OBE had been awarded to someone who hadn't fought against the Nazis but had stayed at home and sold sugar on the black market, they'd call it Other Bugger's Efforts. Honours like that should only go to people who are brave in battle or help others less fortunate than themselves. I was just doing a job and there's nothing courageous or special about being a golf commentator. So I was never going to consider an OBE for services to golf. People make assumptions about me but they're usually wrong. They don't know me.\" </p> <p>As he uncovers a little more of the man inside the commentating persona, Alliss describes the great tragedy of his life. His third daughter, Victoria, was born with massive and irreparable brain damage. \"My wife, Jackie, was shattered - but she became a giant. For 11 years she visited Victoria in a home every day, showing her love and tenderness even though it was unlikely anything was being absorbed. I behaved badly. I became an ostrich. I couldn't visit Victoria. </p> <p>\"When she was 11 we got this call late at night to say she had just died. We didn't cause a fuss - but her death did change me. Before then I wanted people to like me. I'd get upset if I walked past old Joe and he didn't say good morning to me for some reason. I suddenly realised, well, maybe his wife left him or his granny died the night before. As long as they don't come and hit me over the head with a golf club, it doesn't matter what they think of me. </p> <p>\"But, as a commentator, I still get hurt by the criticism. I might get a hundred letters and 95 of them are very nice but I remember the five that call me a prick. They're usually badly spelt and scrawled on yellow paper and I wonder why they feel the need to write so vehemently.\" </p> <p>For all the antiquated folksiness of his commentary, the bitterness some feel towards him is also down to the fact that he exemplifies a certain class of people in this country. But Alliss rebuts the suggestion that he was outraged by Ian Poulter's Union Jack trousers or the sight of Jodie Kidd playing alongside Colin Montgomorie at St Andrews last week. \"I don't mind that stuff. People said I'd be offended by young Poulter. I just thought he looked a bit silly - nothing more.\" </p> <p>While clearly not pitching himself to the Poulter posse who read Golf Punk rather than Golf Illustrated, I am still surprised when Alliss reveals whom he pretends he is talking to when delivering his chatty commentaries. Rather than his old chum propping up the bar in an exclusive Dorset clubhouse, Alliss imagines that \"I'm talking to someone stuck in a tiny flat on the 23rd floor of some high-rise in Bermondsey.\" </p> <p>He brushes aside the possibility that the average council-estate resident in south-east London might not be interested in his views on Charterhouse or some \"smashing fellow from the Royal and Ancient\". He argues instead that \"golf gets played in some beautiful places and I try to take the person stuck at home with me. I try to make golf accessible while also highlighting the scenery to that old lady back in Bermondsey. People say I warble on too much about birdsong or the kid in a pram, but I've never been one to say, 'Here's Joe Brown, number 94 on the money list, he's played 48 tournaments so far and won $292,312.' I'm more observant than that.\" </p> <p>Alliss leans forward in his chair. \"You know,\" he says conspiratorially, \"if I hadn't taken up golf, I would've made a good detective. I am very, very observant.\" </p> <p>His gaze narrows and he sizes me up as if he's ready to question me about the bloody murder of Colonel Mustard. \"I would have been a detective like Columbo. All that scratching his head and looking a complete idiot, while prattling on about the most inane rubbish. That sounds like me. But Columbo was extremely observant. He always got there in the end.\" </p> <p>With a defiance that will thrill his followers and infuriate his detractors, Alliss's powers of observation are unlikely to become more introspective in the near future. He seems to be looking up instead at another of his old heroes for inspiration. \"We all reach that point when people think you're getting past it - but what keeps me going is the thought that the BBC offered Dan Maskell, the great tennis commentator, a new three-year contract when he was 81. So there's hope for me yet . . .\" </p> <p>Peter Alliss - My Autobiography is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton on October 18 at \u00a318.99.

  "<p>The BBC unveils its first interactive drama tonight, claiming to have learned lessons from past attempts to allow viewers to \"get closer\" to their favourite programmes. At the end of the first episode of the returning spy series Spooks, viewers watching on Sky and Freeview will be able to press the red button on their remote control to find out if they have \"what it takes to become a spook\". They will be greeted by spy master Harry Pearce (played by Peter Firth), who will oversee their progress through six training games, which provide an introduction to the skills needed by spies. </p> <p>This training module will be repeated at the end of the show for its first five weeks before making way for a game that replicates a mission for the following five weeks. </p> <p>\"The training game is great fun,\" enthuses Sophie Walpole, head of interactive drama and entertainment at the BBC. \"At the end of the show we ask you to press red and then Harry talks viewers through observation and memory tests, making sure you watch the split screen and follow the action so you don't miss any clues. There's even a garbology test where you have to go through someone's rubbish and pick out items that would reveal something about them - apparently garbology is a real word. </p> <p>\"The thing it really has going for it is that it gives viewers what they really want from interactive - it tells them something about themselves. We've found out through Test The Nation that people are most receptive to interactive when they get rated somehow, and so telling people if they're good enough to be a spook struck us as something that would prove really popular.\" </p> <p>The decision to split the interactive game into the same training module for the first five weeks and then the same mission for the next five was taken because the BBC had to concede that it could not rely on viewers watching every show. </p> <p>\"People don't consume television like they used to,\" says Andrew Whitehouse, a producer specialising in so-called 'enhanced television', who created the Spooks service. \"You can't rely on them watching every week because there are so many other things going on in their lives. If you made it different every week you'd put off people from playing if they missed last week's show.\" </p> <p>Whitehouse claims the interactive games at the end of the show are unique because the corporation realised that there was sufficient interest in espionage and gadgets to allow it to \"go deeper\" with Spooks than previous enhanced television services. \"The things you normally consider doing are along the lines of the DVD extra features people are now pretty familiar with,\" he says. \"Traditionally you'd be looking at a couple of interviews with the stars, some extra text telling you about the show and maybe a video guide to behind the scenes. With Spooks being a spy show, it just screamed out for us to tap in to the interest there is in the world of espionage and build a game around it. As far as we know, it's a world first.\" </p> <p>While it may be a first to have an interactive game built around a drama brand, the BBC has experimented widely with enhanced television, allowing viewers, for example, to switch to another court at Wimbledon or to get more information about dinosaurs during Walking With Beasts. </p> <p>Walpole claims this experience has taught the corporation some valuable lessons that will avoid a repetition of The Murder Game, which aired last year with a disappointing response to its accompanying interactive service. The show, described by Walpole as \"Big Brother meets a murder mystery\", saw members of the public on screen trying to solve a killing. At home, viewers could press red to play along and receive extra clues. </p> <p>\"It was far too complicated,\" Walpole confesses. \"You were faced with far too many choices that took you away from the main show, so only a very small percentage actually bothered to play the game once they'd pressed red. So we now know that for interactive to work, it has to be very simple and it mustn't divert attention from the show.\" </p> <p>It is this latter point that has been key in convincing Kudos, the independent production company behind Spooks, that the series would be suitable for the BBC's first interactive drama. </p> <p>\"We know that the BBC has come to see Spooks as a big hit, and so wanted to do something for the third series,\" reveals Kudos managing director Jane Featherstone. </p> <p>\"We knew it would be right for an interactive element because it's particularly strong with young men who are obviously very into gadgets and open to trying out interactive television. The one problem, though, that we'd always had with interactive drama is that it seemed such a silly idea for a production company to spend a year or so getting a programme ready for the screen only to allow viewers to be taken away halfway through it. I think it's something the BBC has learned has to come after the show, so it can build on its appeal rather than get in the way of the show itself.\" </p> <p>The BBC claims to have no worries that the interactive service could take viewers away from the Ten O'Clock News because, as Whitehouse says, \"if we were worried about that we'd just have the one channel\". </p> <p>It will be accompanied by an updated website (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/spooks)\">www.bbc.co.uk/spooks)</a> that also features tests that will establish how well suited the user is to becoming a spy, as measured by their skill, reaction and logic scores. </p> <p>Ultimately, the BBC's Interactive Drama and Entertainment division hopes that one day they will be able to combine the different experiences of web and television interaction, allowing people to play a branded game at home on their television sets yet still feeling linked to like-minded viewers. </p> <p>\"The thing the web has going for it is you get a far greater sense of community than you get sat at home playing a game on the television,\" says Whitehouse. \"It's a shame that the technology's not quite there yet for us to link people playing on the television so they could chat about the show and maybe compare scores. That would be the ultimate interactive service.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is over two years since the US music industry closed Napster and announced they would target private individuals. Last week the UK's music industry finally announced the end of their phoney war and opened up a second front in the battle against piracy. The BPI, the UK's music industry trade body, has the option of launching civil or criminal claims against the pirates. </p> <p>However, the criminal route is fraught with risks. The burden of proof needed in the criminal courts is so high that it will always make this an uncertain option. A criminal case against file swapping would also bring the BPI into relatively new and uncharted areas of the law. The likelihood is that the case would need to reach the House of Lords before it could be put to bed. </p> <p>Instead the BPI has taken the much more pragmatic approach of launching 28 civil lawsuits against uploaders, those individuals that make their music collections available to other individuals - the dealers rather than the junkies. For the uploaders, the fact that they will be faced by civil rather than criminal action should not cause them to rejoice. UK law is very clear-cut on the theft of intellectual property. Whether you are file swapping for fun or for commercial gain, if you are depriving the composers of the fruits of their labour and record companies of their income you can be pursued for very substantial damages. </p> <p>The levels of damages would be established by looking at the number of songs that the uploader had enabled to be copied rather than the amount of money that they have made from that copying. Each copy made would entitle the composer and the performer to their royalties, so the BPI does not have to prove that when a file has been downloaded it has resulted in a lost sale. </p> <p>The damages that the BPI could demand are scary - one user of one illegal uploader can fit 5,000 songs, roughly 400 albums, on to just one IPod. If you are an uploader who is proud of the popularity of the service you provide to the internet community, you may face a truly life-changing bill. BPI has said that the damages that it will pursue will be decided by how quickly the cases settle. Cases are likely to settle for a fraction of the total theoretical damages bill. </p> <p>In the US each illegal download of a copyrighted song carries a maximum penalty of $150,000, but public relations concerns mean that cases have been settled for tiny percentages of the maximum. </p> <p>The BPI has also said that at as well as seeking damages they will issue injunctions through the civil court that will forbid the downloaders from infringing copyrights again. Typically such injunctions cover the work of one artist, but in the case of music pirates, for such injunctions to be effective they will have to be drawn very widely. There is no point in restricting somebody from infringing the copyright of Britney Spears and the Pixies as that would leave the pirates free to rip off any other band's music the next week. Instead the injunction will have to take the form of a copyright Anti-Social Behaviour Order. </p> <p>If the uploader infringes the injunction, proceedings could be started for contempt of court. If found in contempt, the uploader will have to pick up the tab for court and legal costs. For the simplest of cases this will be \u00a310,000 to \u00a320,000. It's not unknown for the courts to sentence those found guilty of contempt to seven days in jail to give the offender a bit of time to dwell on things. </p> <p>Before the BPI can roll its legal guns out into action they need to cross one obstacle. That's identifying who they want to attack. At the moment the BPI is likely to know little more about the identity of their quarry than the handful of anonymous sounding IP addresses. </p> <p>What the BPI will need to do next is make an application to the courts to force the Internet Service Providers to disclose the names and addresses behind the IP addresses. Normally, it is \"Norwich Pharmical orders\" which are used to force the disclosure of information from those who have been innocently involved in copyright infringements. The orders are named after the pharmaceutical company that successfully won disclosure of information from Customs &amp; Excise who had seized a shipment of pirated drugs. </p> <p>The ISPs could choose to challenge these orders on the grounds that their involvement began and ended with the relay of transient data packets and that they had no involvement, unwitting or otherwise, in the actual copyright infringements. </p> <p>If the BPI find this route blocked they are sure to find another path. What little hope that downloaders have of avoiding ruinous damages is dependent on the BPI's fear of bad publicity. But the BPI is saying that who it decides to pursue will not be determined by \"political correctness\". </p> <p>The US music industry was willing to take a case against a 12-year-old girl and despite adverse publicity still forced her mother to pay $2,000. In the UK 12 is also seen as the age at which minors are culpable for their actions. Another reason why we can still feel a little bit uneasy about our children's enthusiastic embrace of technology? </p> <p>My advice to the uploaders? Time to pack it in. You have done your job and forced the music industry to sell in the format in which millions want to use, not the format the music industry wanted to peddle. The next test for the music industry is whether the claimed \"lost\" sales are related to the format or the content. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Andrew Hobson is head of IP at commercial law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain.</p>",
  "<p>Oxford University today denied that the language used in its new admissions test for potential history undergraduates would discriminate against state school pupils.</p> <p>The new test, which will be sat for the first time next month, asks pupils to evaluate political theories and apply them to real-life situations from history as well as reading and analysing 10th-century source documents.</p> <p>The university dropped entrance tests nine years ago after fears that the language favoured pupils from middle class and independent schools. They have reintroduced a new aptitude-based test to help them select the top students from a growing pool of straight A-grade applicants.</p> <p>The two-hour history test, which is expected to help the university cut the number of people it must interview for history courses, follows the introduction of the Lnat entrance test for law at a selection of top universities as well as the Bmat for medical undergraduates. </p> <p>The test, known as the History Aptitude Test (Hat) test, asks applicants to read through a text and answer four questions, including: \" 'To be sure, the pure types are rarely found in reality'. Do you think historians should make use of 'types' and theories in discussing the past? Write a paragraph setting out your answer and the reasons for it.\"</p> <p>Today John Dunford, the general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, was reported in the Daily Telegraph as saying he was \"very concerned\" that the tests could discriminate against state school pupils. </p> <p>\"There is every chance that it will discriminate against pupils from minority backgrounds or state schools by the language that is used,\" he said.</p> <p>In response John Watts, the history admissions coordinator at Oxford University, said in a statement to EducationGuardian.co.uk: \"In developing the Hat, we consulted very widely with teachers and students from all kinds of schools, including a significant number from inner-city and socially disadvantaged areas. </p> <p>\"The language of the test was an issue that was frequently discussed in our consultations. Some teachers did suggest that their students might find it difficult.\"</p> <p>But he added that all applicants would have to have a high level of linguistic competence, which justified the use of complicated language.</p> <p>The Hat is the latest in a series of new tests for university applicants. Professor Steven Schwartz, the vice-chancellor of Brunel University, last month published a government-backed review of university admissions which recommended that a national admissions test be piloted to cut back on the proliferation of university-level tests.</p>",
  "The health secretary, John Reid, will today take legal advice on whether a British charity should face prosecution for referring women who want late abortions to overseas clinics. <p>Government lawyers are expected to begin analysing evidence from the Sunday Telegraph after it reported that the British Pregnancy Advisory Service was giving women who wanted an abortion after the 24-week legal cutoff details of a clinic in Barcelona. </p> <p>Yesterday, the BPAS chief executive, Ann Furedi, justified the move, arguing that it would be \"morally reprehensible\" not to do so. But Mr Reid said he would act swiftly if it was found that the service had contravened the Abortion Act. </p> <p>A Department of Health spokeswoman, speaking before covertly recorded information was handed over, said: \"If there is evidence that the will of parliament is being thwarted, and in addition the law of a fellow European country is being broken, by an organisation in receipt of public money, this would be a very serious matter indeed.\" </p> <p>It was unclear what legal powers the secretary of state would have if - as BPAS insists - it was clear it had not breached the Abortion Act. But sources indicated that the charity, which receives NHS contracts worth about \u00a312m annually, could be in difficulties if it sought to circumvent British law by referring women abroad as a matter of policy. </p> <p>Ms Furedi suggested this was the case when she said the organisation, Britain's second largest abortion provider, helped clients get treatment in Spain and the US. </p> <p>\"There is nothing we are doing that is unlawful. We are informing women who come to us that there are circumstances in which we can't lawfully provide them with an abortion, and provide them with information that they can receive treatment in other countries.\"</p>",
  "<p>An unexplained and unprecedented rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere two years running has raised fears that the world may be on the brink of runaway global warming. </p> <p>Scientists are baffled why the quantity of the main greenhouse gas has leapt in a two-year period and are concerned that the Earth's natural systems are no longer able to absorb as much as in the past. </p> <p>The findings will be discussed tomorrow by the government's chief scientist, Dr David King, at the annual Greenpeace business lecture. </p> <p>Measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere have been continuous for almost 50 years at Mauna Loa Observatory, 12,000ft up a mountain in Hawaii, regarded as far enough away from any carbon dioxide source to be a reliable measuring point. </p> <p>In recent decades CO2 increased on average by 1.5 parts per million (ppm) a year because of the amount of oil, coal and gas burnt, but has now jumped to more than 2 ppm in 2002 and 2003. </p> <p>Above or below average rises in CO2 levels in the atmosphere have been explained in the past by natural events. </p> <p>When the Pacific warms up during El Ni\u00f1o - a disruptive weather pattern caused by weakening trade winds - the amount of carbon dioxide rises dramatically because warm oceans emit CO2 rather than absorb it. </p> <p>But scientists are puzzled because over the past two years, when the increases have been 2.08 ppm and 2.54 ppm respectively, there has been no El Ni\u00f1o. </p> <p>Charles Keeling, the man who began the observations in 1958 as a young climate scientist, is now 74 and still working in the field. </p> <p>He said yesterday: \"The rise in the annual rate to above two parts per million for two consecutive years is a real phenomenon. </p> <p>\"It is possible that this is merely a reflection of natural events like previous peaks in the rate, but it is also possible that it is the beginning of a natural process unprecedented in the record.\" </p> <p>Analysts stress that it is too early to draw any long-term conclusions. </p> <p>But the fear held by some scientists is that the greater than normal rises in C02 emissions mean that instead of decades to bring global warming under control we may have only a few years. At worst, the figures could be the first sign of the breakdown in the Earth's natural systems for absorbing the gas. </p> <p>That would herald the so-called \"runaway greenhouse effect\", where the planet's soaring temperature becomes impossible to contain. As the icecaps melt, less sunlight is refected back into space from ice and snow, and bare rocks begin to absorb more heat. This is already happening. </p> <p>One of the predictions made by climate scientists in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is that as the Earth warms, the absorption of carbon dioxide by vegetation - known as \"carbon sink\" - is reduced. </p> <p>Dr Keeling said since there was no sign of a dramatic increase in the amount of fossil fuels being burnt in 2002 and 2003, the rise \"could be a weakening of the Earth's carbon sinks, associated with the world warming, as part of a climate change feedback mechanism. It is a cause for concern'.' </p> <p>Tom Burke, visiting professor at Imperial College London, and a former special adviser to the former Tory environment minister John Gummer, warned: \"We're watching the clock and the clock is beginning to tick faster, like it seems to before a bomb goes off.\" </p> <p>Peter Cox, head of the Carbon Cycle Group at the Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Change, said the increase in carbon dioxide was not uniform across the globe. </p> <p>Measurements of CO2 levels in Australia and at the south pole were slightly lower, he said, so it looked as though something unusual had occurred in the northern hemisphere. </p> <p>\"My guess is that there were extra forest fires in the northern hemisphere, and particularly a very hot summer in Europe,\" Dr Cox said. \"This led to a die-back in vegetation and an increase in release of carbon from the soil, rather than more growing plants taking carbon out of the atmosphere, which is usually the case in summer.\" </p> <p>Scientists are have dubbed the two-year CO2 rise the Mauna Loa anomaly. Dr Cox said one of its most interesting aspects was that the CO2 rises did not take place in El Ni\u00f1o years. Previously the only figures that climbed higher than 2 ppm were El Ni\u00f1o years - 1973, 1988, 1994 and 1998. </p> <p>The heatwave of last year that is now believed to have claimed at least 30,000 lives across the world was so out of the ordinary that many scientists believe it could only have been caused by global warming. </p> <p>But Dr Cox, like other scientists, is concerned that too much might be read into two years' figures. \"Five or six years on the trot would be very difficult to explain,\" he said. </p> <p>Dr Piers Forster, senior research fellow of the University of Reading's Department of Meteorology, said: \"If this is a rate change, of course it will be very significant. It will be of enormous concern, because it will imply that all our global warming predictions for the next hundred years or so will have to be redone.\" </p> <p>David J Hofmann of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration centre, which also studies CO2, was more cautious. </p> <p>\"I don't think an increase of 2 ppm for two years in a row is highly significant - there are climatic perturbations that can make this occur,\" he said. \"But the absence of a known climatic event does make these years unusual. </p> <p>\"Based on those two years alone I would say it was too soon to say that a new trend has been established, but it warrants close scrutiny.\"</p>",
  "The national regulatory body for teachers in England yesterday pledged to end a legal anomaly that has prevented the head of a top private school with some of the best exam results in the country from switching to the state sector. <p>Tristram Jones-Parry, head of \u00a315,200-a-year Westminster school in central London, is retiring next year and wanted to offer his services - based on 30 years' experience - as a maths teacher to state schools.</p> <p>But the General Teaching Council for England said it had been unable to register the 57-year-old because he did not have \"qualified teacher status\" (QTS), which is generally obtained by completing a one-year postgraduate certificate in education or another training route.</p> <p>Teachers can work in the private sector without obtaining QTS. But in the state sector it is, by law, a condition of registration.</p> <p>The revelation yesterday sparked claims from Tim Collins, the shadow education secretary, that it was \"ludicrous\" that a \"silly rule\" should prevent a highly experienced maths teacher from teaching at a time of chronic shortage of maths specialists.</p> <p>Carol Adams, chief executive of the GTC (England), denied the incident was embarrassing for the organisation, but said she would be taking urgent steps to try to introduce a \"fast-track\" system to allow candidates of Mr Jones-Parry's standing to be approved for teaching in a different way.</p> <p>\"The legislation was passed for the best reasons. But clearly when someone is at the end of their career it's not reasonable to expect them to do a year at college, and a teacher such as Mr Jones-Parry has a lot to offer. This has highlighted an anomaly we have been seeking to address. We will be taking it up with the Department for Education and Skills.\"</p> <p>Mr Jones-Parry, who has been head of Westminster school for six years and taught maths there for 21 years before that, said: \"I wrote to the GTC and was told by a senior person that I can't teach without registering and that I can't register because I do not have qualified status.\"</p>",

  "<p>Former BBC director general Greg Dyke has been recruited as an adviser by Apax Partners, the private equity group that has been linked in recent years with a string of media deals including bids for ITV, Trinity Mirror and the Telegraph Group. </p> <p>Mr Dyke, who has declared himself open to offers after completing his book on the events that saw him kicked out of the corporation in the wake of Lord Hutton's report, has joined Apax's media advisory board to help examine possible deals. </p> <p>The board, chaired by former Merrill Lynch star media analyst Neil Blackley, is expected to run the rule over a number of big media deals in the coming year, including a possible bid for Big Brother producer Endemol. </p> <p>A number of private equity groups are looking at Endemol in anticipation of its owner, Spanish telecoms group Telefonica, firing the starting gun on a \u00a31bn-plus auction process. </p> <p>Mr Blackley left Merrill Lynch last year in order to spend more time with his family, but has also been recruited by Apax to spearhead its drive into the media industry across Europe. </p> <p>Last year, Mr Blackley was instrumental in putting together a consortium to bid for ITV prior to the merger of Carlton and Granada. </p> <p>Together with chief executive Stephen Grabiner, he put together a potential management team that included Sky sales chief Nick Milligan and Michael Grade, who then held a number of non-executive positions before he took up his current role as BBC chairman. </p> <p>In the event, shareholders made it clear that they wouldn't entertain a bid before seeing what effect the merger had on the share price. </p> <p>Mr Grabiner, a former executive at the Telegraph and Express newspapers, had already spent several weeks touring the offices of senior media executives and other partners in an effort to win support for an ITV takeover. </p> <p>He even talked to Lord Hollick, his former boss at United Business Media, about a possible return to the world of broadcasting. Apax also lined up Haim Saban, the American entrepreneur behind Power Rangers, as a possible bidding partner</p> <p>Earlier this year, Apax also made it to the final shortlist of bidders to buy the assets of the Telegraph Group from Hollinger International, although it conceded that eventual winners, the Barclay brothers, were always in pole position given their private funding and willingness to pay a premium. </p> <p>Apax is also keeping a very close eye on the German market, where they have also recruited experts to their media board. Private equity groups believe 2005 will be a good time to invest in media and telecoms groups as advertising revenues return and the industry consolidates while share prices remain relatively low. </p> <p>Apax was frustrated in a bid to buy German broadcaster ProSieben from bankrupt media giant Kirch, when Mr Saban clinched his own deal. And in 2002 a risky bid to rescue ITV Digital, the doomed digital broadcaster of which Mr Grabiner was the launch chief executive, also came to nothing. </p> <p>One of Mr Dyke's new colleagues will be ITV chairman Sir Peter Burt, who took up a new role at Apax shortly after accepting the ITV job to advise it on financial services companies, one of six sectors in which in invests.</p> <p>The broadcasting rumour mill went into overdrive earlier this year when Sir Peter was spotted talking to Mr Dyke at the Apax offices, sparking speculation that he was being lined up to replace ITV chief executive Charles Allen. </p> <p>Mr Burt was forced to issue a statement publicly backing Mr Allen, and the likelihood of Mr Dyke being offered the ITV job further receded when it became clear that Fidelity, the investment bank that forced the departure of Carlton chairman Michael Green, was happy with the current management for now. </p> <p>The group's current media investments include cable group NTL and publishing company Future Network.

  "<p>Now that Barry Davies has retired, John Motson can relax a bit and sit back on his throne, content in the knowledge that he is the undisputed king of football commentary. He's always been number one really; Davies never quite had the warmth of Motson, he never made you feel that you were watching the game with an old mate. </p> <p>Like all old mates, Motty can be annoying at times. He does those awful puns for one thing. On <strong> Match of the Day</strong> (BBC1, Saturday), the England-Wales match, he was at it before the game had even started. A famous opera singer had just sung both national anthems. \"Certainly Russell Watson did very well there to get through both those anthems,\" said Motson. \"I suppose you could say two for a tenor really.\" I know 11-year-olds who would roll their eyes at that one John. </p> <p>But he was right; Russell Watson had done well to get through it, particularly Land of Our Fathers, which was booed to oblivion by the English. Maybe the Welsh were also booing Watson for not bothering to learn the first verse of their anthem by heart. Where's Bryn Terfel when you need him? </p> <p>Motson mentioned the booing, but chose not to hear the shouts of \"Fuck off Wales\" from some charming England fans during the period of silence for Ken Bigley. </p> <p>Once the game was under way, Motson came in to his own. As ever he showed immense understanding of the game while always managing to sound humble. Often you could hear the smile on his face, a smile that would at times break into one of those wonderful mid-sentence Motson chuckles, as if he's suddenly realising what a wonderful thing he's saying. </p> <p>There wasn't enough high drama in the game to produce any classic Motson moments, but he describe John Hartson as \"something of a Brecon Beacon up there today I would have thought\". He added, \"There won't be much support either side,\" as if that explained why he was a Brecon Beacon. Are Brecon Beacons solitary mountains, surrounded by great flat plains? Why wasn't Giggs Snowdon? Or Bellamy Cadair Idris? </p> <p>It's the same for commentators as it is for footballers: the best ones aren't afraid of having a go at anything, and it doesn't always come off. I don't think the Brecon Beacon thing came off really, but did I want to hit the red button on the remote control at half time to get an alternative commentary from BBC Wales? Don't be daft. </p> <p>Robbie Savage was a different kind of joy. The Welsh midfielder, suspended from the game, joined Lineker and co for some half time chat. He was a nice presence, as smiley and relaxed off the pitch as he is normally hard as nails on it. But he didn't have an awful lot to add to the punditry. Alan Shearer was uncharacteristically lucid; Alan Hanson sat back, scoffed, knew it all and said \"unbelievable\" a lot; and Savage, looking like a German porn star with that long blond hair of his, just said \"y'know\" a lot. \"Yeah, y'know,\" he said, \"maybe, y'know, they haven't had many shots but, y'know, they're in the game and when it's one nil, y'know, anything, as y'know anything, can happen.\" </p> <p>On Sunday night it looked as if Channel Five had handed over programming to Rebecca Loos. Great she said, I'll have a bitchy hatchet job about my ex-love rival, followed by a sympathetic documentary about the man whose pants I'm currently trying to get inside, followed by a programme about me! </p> <p>First then, Posh was given a red card on <strong>Victoria Beckham's Secrets</strong> (Five). An old schoolfriend, an ex-fiance, a former producer, someone called Michelle Stevenson who was in the Spice Girls before they were famous (Bitter Spice?) - they all turned up to say how awful Posh is and how false she is. I'm sure everything they said is true, but I'm not convinced that makes it worth showing on television. </p> <p><strong>Stan Collymore: Confessions of A Premiership Footballer</strong> followed. The former striker went back to some of his old haunts: Anfield, the Paris bar where he beat up Ulrika Jonsson, his favourite dogging car park. Actually this one was quite good because Stan was so honest about the mess he's made of everything, and so much better at talking than Robbie Savage. </p> <p>It didn't include his latest bad decision - appearing on <strong> The Farm</strong> (Five), from which he stormed off on Friday. Copy deadlines mean that I don't know if Rebecca Loos (rhymes with dose) was kicked off last night, enabling her to go and hunt Stan down. And to be honest, I don't care.</p>",

His evidence brought home to me the moribund state of democracy in Britain. <p>Like all WMD anoraks (especially those of us who had initially been persuaded to support the war), I could recite the prime minister's words in the September 2002 intelligence dossier by heart. \"Intelligence has established beyond doubt that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons, that he continues to develop nuclear weapons ... some of these weapons can be ready for use in 45 minutes ... the threat is serious and current.\" We were 45 minutes from doom. Remember? </p> <p>Duelfer's conclusions definitively buried that dossier. Saddam Hussein had ended his nuclear programme and destroyed his chemical and biological weapons stocks more than a decade ago. We may have been 45 minutes from doom. But that was in 1991. </p> <p>Duelfer had the courage to state this with clarity. Remarkably, his report was commissioned by an agency of the US government itself - the CIA under George Tenet, who, with his subsequent resignation, effectively took personal responsibility for the pre-war intelligence mistakes. Contrast here the behaviour of John Scarlett in Britain. </p> <p>The Senate's examination of the Duelfer report was a model of serious democratic debate. John Kerry has now staked out a clear alternative point of view on Iraq, and there have been three hours of head-on Bush-Kerry television debate in the past week. So the US election is, among other things, a plebiscite on the Iraq issue. If the American people choose to re-elect their president, we are at liberty to disagree with their verdict, but at least democracy will have spoken. </p> <p>Those who wrote the US constitution were obsessed with checks and balances. Their handiwork remains intact today. And how sharp the contrast is between America, and Britain. Where are the checks and balances constraining Blair, the ability to hold him to account? </p> <p>I have been searching in vain. Compare Duelfer's rigour and honesty with that of his British equivalents, Lords Hutton and Butler. Of the inept former, enough has been said. For the latter, I have much more time. I suspect, though, that Robin Butler was constrained by others on his committee, and in the end they bottled out of assigning responsibility, having published more than enough evidence to show that there had been political interference in the intelligence dossier. No 10 ended up controlling both of these supposedly independent inquiries. </p> <p>What about parliament? The select committees, compared with those in Washington, were an abject failure. Entirely controlled by the power of No 10's patronage, the chairman of the culture committee, Gerald Kaufman, sent the BBC a letter of complaint about its war coverage that was drafted verbatim for him by none other than Alastair Campbell. And the foreign affairs committee was so eager to humiliate Andrew Gilligan that it forgot to get the truth out of David Kelly when it had the chance. As a source of genuine scrutiny of the executive, this is just ridiculous. </p> <p>Even more troublingly, our electoral system seems incapable of holding No 10 to account. Regrettably, the Conservatives have been so hamstrung by their original support for the war that they have been unable to land a single telling blow in 2004, despite being let loose in a veritable candy store of political opportunity. The Liberal Democrats have done better, but given the expected low turnout next year, Blair's tendency could get the support of less than 25% of the electorate and still win a large Commons majority. </p> <p>So I reluctantly conclude that there is but one part of our democratic process that is in robust working order. And that is the press. The Daily Mail, the Independent, the Guardian and the television news services have all pursued the Iraq issue like a pack of rottweilers gnawing at one gigantic bone. </p> <p>Increasingly hated by the government, the press has been accused of trivialising politics and breeding mistrust of our leaders. To some extent that is true, but the attacks by Campbell on the BBC last year mostly reflected the pent-up frustration that the fourth estate was the one remaining estate of the realm that would not dance to his tune. </p> <p>Far from being the weak link in our democratic chain, hard-bitten and stubborn journalists have almost single-handedly forced the government to account for its actions over the past two years. We should all be grateful that they are still around. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Gavyn Davies was chairman of the BBC from 2001-2004. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gavyn.davies@fulcrumasset.com\">gavyn.davies@fulcrumasset.com</a></p>",
  "<p>John Allwood, head of mobile phone company Orange UK for the last four years, is quitting to join the Telegraph group. He is to become executive director, reporting directly to the group's new chief executive, Murdoch MacLennan. </p> <p>A Telegraph source indicated that Mr Allwood will have \"the freedom to assess the full spectrum\" of the newspaper group's activities. His appointment suggests that there may be a radical overhaul ahead for the company, which was bought by Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay in June for \u00a3665m. </p> <p>Mr Allwood has a long track record in the newspaper industry and has a detailed knowledge of how to run papers on tight budgets. He is credited with having made a major contribution to solving the financial headaches at Mirror Group in the wake of Robert Maxwell's death. He also has an intimate knowledge of how the most successful newspaper company, Rupert Murdoch's News International, is run. </p> <p>Mr MacLennan and Mr Allwood worked smoothly together for a time at Mirror Group and their re-established relationship could herald changes at the Telegraph's Canary Wharf headquarters. </p> <p>It is thought that, as of last night, all the paper's senior executives were unaware of Mr Allwood's appointment and its significance. </p> <p>Given that Mr MacLennan only moved into his post two weeks ago after resigning as managing director of Associated Newspapers, which runs the Daily Mail, it is a swift decision. Neither Mr MacLennan nor Mr Allwood were available for comment. </p> <p>Mr Allwood, 53, who comes from an accountancy background, is regarded as a level-headed, cautious but shrewd operator. Before joining Orange in December 2000 he was deputy chief executive of Trinity Mirror but resigned after failing to form a good working relationship with the then chief executive, Philip Graf. </p> <p>Mr Allwood had joined Mirror group as finance director during its dark days in 1992 after the Maxwell pensions debacle and was faced with transforming the company's financial fortunes. </p> <p>It led to boardroom promotion, culminating in his appointment as Mirror Group chief executive in 1999. He then oversaw the merger with the regional chain, Trinity, headed by Mr Graf and stepped aside to become Mr Graf's deputy, a demotion which rankled. </p> <p>He had originally arrived at the Mirror from Microtel Communications, which later became Orange, having previously spent 11 years at News International in important financial posts. He was finance director of the newspaper division and later at Sky Television, often working closely with Mr Murdoch. </p> <p>Six months after leaving Mirror Group, in December 2000, he joined Orange as its executive vice-president. He has been responsible recently for overseeing a wide-ranging restructuring of Orange UK for its parent company, France T\u00e9l\u00e9com. One result was a report last month that Orange was about to cut 300 jobs from its British operation. </p> <p>It is not known when Mr Allwood will take up his new post, though a Telegraph source said it is expected Orange will release him quickly. </p>",
  "<p>There are two ways of viewing the actions of the Manchester United supporters who have taken it upon themselves to \"initiate a civil war\" in an effort to block the likely \u00a3780m takeover bid for the club by the American property billionaire Malcolm Glazer. </p> <p>One is a romantic one of them keeping the world's most famous club in the hands of the fans. The other, altogether darker interpretation of the work of the self-styled Manchester Education Committee is that a potentially dangerous pressure group is moving into areas that might have more to do with urban terrorism than legitimate protest. Coming just ahead of the news of Kenneth Bigley's death in Iraq, the threats expose an extraordinary - and worrying - lack of perspective inside their minds. </p> <p>First there was the daubing of the United director Maurice Watkins's Jaguar with red paint, a night-time attack on his property that was supposedly a punishment for his decision to sell a million of his shares in the club to Glazer. Next came the disruption of a Manchester United reserve fixture by protesters in the classic terrorist garb of black balaclavas. An American flag was burnt and a banner bearing the words \"Not for Sale\" was unfurled. For the demonstrators, headlines had been made and the first shots of their war fired. </p> <p>A statement followed from the MEC saying: \"For too long the wishes of Manchester United fans, and football fans in general, have been ignored as clubs sacrifice everything at the altar of commercialism\" - and some would say they have a point, although even a cursory look at the palatial Old Trafford stadium would suggest that this particular shrine has benefited magnificently from the money that continues to pour into the club. But it was the words that followed that should send a shudder through the decent people who make up the vast bulk of United's support. </p> <p>\"We intend to initiate a civil war effectively setting the football club - the supporters - against the company. In such a situation it is our intention to render the club ungovernable and actively disrupt all manner of commercial activ ity associated with Manchester United.\" The message is clearly threatening in its tone, not least because the MEC went on to encourage the \"targeting\" of other directors believed to be sympathetic to a Glazer takeover as well as public relations companies involved with the bid and, ultimately, Glazer himself. </p> <p>An escalation of the demonstrations seems certain if Glazer's representatives are successful in persuading the Irish horse breeders John Magnier and JP McManus to part with their 28.9% stake in the club. My worry is that the sort of people capable of damaging a club director's personal property would be more than prepared to resort to violence if they thought it would aid their cause. </p> <p>Presumably we are dealing with the same supporters who \"targeted\" Magnier and McManus when they were seemingly intent on undermining Sir Alex Ferguson's position in the club because of the Rock of Gibraltar affair, with the Irishmen increasing their stake in the club while Ferguson disputed their right to stud fees from the colt. In all probability Magnier and McManus never wanted to take control of United but they might also have been influenced by the way in which opposition was orchestrated against them. </p> <p>Old Trafford was seemingly consumed by hatred for the two. A race meeting at Hereford, where one of the Irishmen's horses was running, was disrupted and there were threats that the Cheltenham Festival might attract demonstrations. </p> <p>Then my observation - only partially tongue in cheek - was that thousands of Irish racegoers would take a dim view of their entertainment being wrecked by a few idiots from Manchester. In the event the protest never happened but it did not stop correspondence reaching me questioning my qualifications for daring to hint that they did not have the right to ruin Cheltenham, where Magnier and McManus horses were running. </p> <p>The irony now is that Glazer will not be able easily to make a takeover bid if he is unable to persuade Magnier and McManus to sell their shares - a sale that would net them a cool \u00a370m in profit from their initial investment. Perhaps they will listen to the MEC and their like. And then again, maybe not. </p> <p>More likely they will remember the vitriol that was aimed in their direction and take the money and run. Certainly anybody who witnessed the demonstrations, banners, T-shirts and obscene chants that reverberated around Old Trafford at the height of the dispute would say it would be unlikely Magnier and McManus feel anything more for Manchester United than the money that can be made from the sale of their shares. </p> <p>So the Glazer bid seems sure to go ahead, despite the efforts of a rival consortium. Glazer's PR men are keen to let it be known Ferguson will remain the key figure in the event of them gaining control. \"They have the highest regard for Alex and he would be offered a new long-term contract,\" a source said. \"If the bid is successful, the fans would be guaranteed a voice in how the club would be run. Glazer and his sons are decent people with a \u00a32bn fortune. Any offer would have elements that would make any fan realise they are concerned about the long-term future of the club.\" </p> <p>Whether those assurances will be enough to appease the MEC boys in black balaclavas remains to be seen. Perhaps they might listen more closely if the words had come from either Glazer or one of his two sons, Joel and Avi, who are supposedly genuine football fans. But, for now, the high-finance game leaves fans cold and some are literally spoiling for a fight.</p>",
  "<p>David Beckham went to so much trouble to get himself booked late in England's match on Saturday, adding the one moment of gratuitous malice to an encounter otherwise remarkable only for its mildness, that conspiracy theories became irresistible. </p> <p>At first it was suggested that he had provoked a caution by flying into a Welsh opponent with such wildness simply because he did not fancy this week's trip to Baku. Others argued, more sensibly, that by serving a one-match suspension against modest opposition, and thereby expunging the yellow card picked up against Austria five weeks ago, he would leave himself unencumbered for the rest of England's fixtures in Group Six.</p> <p>Then the Sunday papers dropped on to the doormat and a new set of possibilities emerged from the latest episode in the tale of Beckham's alleged sexual adventures.</p> <p>Last time it was Rebecca Loos, a children's nanny who walked away with half a million quid for her story of steamy embraces and text sex. This time it is Dannielle Heath, a beautician originally employed by Victoria Beckham but later invited to tan, wax and apparently otherwise minister to the more private regions of the England captain's body.</p> <p>So it may reasonably be suspected that, faced with another four days of media inquisition, Beckham saw an escape route and took it. As a result he can spend the week lying low, avoiding direct questions about his private life and, perhaps, attending to whatever repairs may be necessary.</p> <p>In this connection the key sentence in the Sunday Mirror's story, which occupied the first seven pages of yesterday's edition, was the very final one. \"Last week,\" it said, \"Beckham's press officer contacted us about Dannielle's story and said, 'It's rubbish'.\"</p> <p>If any word of that is true, then it means Beckham knew about the imminent allegations before Saturday's match. And it would be a surprise if that knowledge had not conditioned his mood and his behaviour in some respect.</p> <p>In football terms he used Saturday's match to reinforce his senior position in a team full of youthful promise. The incidents that led to his yellow card, however, looked like the acts of a man whose attention and priorities remain divided. \"Fame,\" as the actor Tony Curtis once warned Bob Dylan, \"is an occupation in itself.\" How long England can afford such a captain is a question gradually gathering urgency.</p> <p>The most charitable explanation of the way he ended his participation in the victory over Wales is that he is an incompetent ball-winner with a hint of recklessness in his temperament. The daft barge that brought him a late caution against Austria would be a further exhibit in the prosecution of that argument. But at 29, and presumably having spent the past six years mulling over the severe consequences of his foolish kick at Diego Simeone in St-Etienne, he may be assumed to be in control of his actions.</p> <p>\"At least it is a good opportunity to clear his yellow card,\" Sven-Goran Eriksson remarked, when asked about the caution at Old Trafford. And anyone who thinks the idea of collecting a booking in order to bring about a suspension and clean the slate is outlandish should remember that Beckham is widely believed to have done exactly that in a Champions League match last season. Real Madrid were leading AS Monaco 4-2 in injury-time of the first leg of their quarter-final when the Englishman, already with a yellow card from an earlier fixture, suddenly lunged at Jaroslav Plasil. The consequent booking kept him out of the away leg, in which Madrid unexpectedly failed to defend the lead they had established in the Bernab\u00e9u stadium.</p> <p>The tactical booking may now be as much a part of his technical repertoire as the sumptuous right-foot shot that he bent from outside the left-hand corner of the penalty area into a spot just inside the angle of the crossbar and the right-hand post, doubling England's lead in the 77th minute. That goal, the finest if not the most crucial of the 15 he has scored in 76 international appearances, had his signature written all over it. Other players might have brought it off, but few with an ease born of habit.</p> <p>If we look at it closely, we see further clues to the secret of his extraordinary gift. There is the turn of the body, with his left shoulder facing the target, like a right-arm outswing bowler. There is the extraordinary hinging of the right ankle, which allows him to wrap his instep around the ball. There is the positioning of the standing foot very close to the ball and the left leg's extreme angle from the perpendicular - the factor that betrayed him first in Istanbul and again in Lisbon, when the left foot could not take a load imposed from such an angle on an unstable surface and gave way, failing to provide the necessary platform for his penalty kicks.</p> <p>Before Saturday's moment of footballing genius he had played a decent enough game. Thanks to Eriksson's use of an attacking trident, with Wayne Rooney lurking behind Michael Owen and Jer main Defoe, Beckham found himself in a role closer to the one he has defined for himself at Real Madrid, lying deep on the right-hand side of a narrow midfield.</p> <p>Recent calls for his omission from the team seemed far away as he helped break up Wales's incoherent attacks, swung the ball out to the touchlines and sent in a selection of dangerous free-kicks and corners. Two minutes after guiding home that marvellous 25-yarder, he was unlucky not to score again when Paul Jones, Wales's brave goalkeeper, blocked his point-blank shot.</p> <p>But then, after 81 minutes, came the first of his two altercations with Ben Thatcher, the visitors' left back. In the first Beckham raced into a 50-50 ball with a dramatic flurry of limbs which had so little to do with the act of winning possession that a free-kick was inevitable. After a minute's treatment he returned to the fray and, at the first available opportunity, again launched himself at Thatcher, this time long after the ball had gone. A yellow card was his reward, along with a hairline rib fracture suffered in the first collision that may keep him out of the game for several weeks. If the petulance visible in those moments evoked memories of his sly kick at Simeone, the poor defensive technique reminded us of the way he jumped out of a crucial tackle in Shizuoka four years later. But perhaps, as we have said, there was another agenda. Or maybe just stupidity.</p> <p>Asked afterwards if he thought Beckham had been irresponsible, Eriksson was at first dismissive. \"No,\" he said. \"Let's talk about the goal he scored. It was special and I was very happy for him, and at 2-0 it killed the game.\"</p> <p>Later, however, speaking before he knew that the rib injury would in any case have kept Beckham off today's flight to Azerbaijan, the manager hinted at another view. \"If I have something to say to David Beckham,\" he said, \"I will do it to him, not to you. We'll see. It was not a good tackle and it cost him one more yellow card. But if I want to criticise my players, I do it privately.\"</p> <p>Once again, however, yesterday's front-page revelations exposed a harsher truth. In the world that Beckham and Eriksson have chosen to inhabit, privacy is just another negotiable commodity.</p>",

  "At the Sunrise and Hope children's centre, next to the refugee camp in Khan Yunis, I found myself a game. Dozens of small boys gathered for an impromptu replay of England v France. Amid the ubiquitous graffiti celebrating the heroes of the intifada, we spoke the globalised language of football. \"Zidane, Zidane, he is Arab,\" they chuckled. <p>Afterwards, they showed me their burns and bullet wounds, proud of the scars that marked them out as mini-martyrs in the fight against oppression. </p> <p>But the bravado of the football field was just that. A nurse from the mother-and-baby clinic in the rabbit-warren Darraj district of Gaza City, where more than 10,000 families are registered, spoke of how all the children suffer bed-wetting and nightmares. Many are too afraid to sleep alone. </p> <p>The Gaza community mental health programme has catalogued a full range of post-traumatic stress symptoms displayed by the children: stammering, depression, headaches, stomach pains, the inability to concentrate. Behind the cheeky grins, the shooting and shelling is educating the children of Gaza on a daily syllabus of fear. </p> <p>Pent-up frustration leads to hyperactivity in school. The centre holds daily anger-management classes. For an hour before school the children throw balls against a wall. In the last few years, academic results have plummeted. </p> <p>It is little wonder. Wella was shot by a sniper during lessons. Unlike the boys, she was close to tears as she showed us a six-inch wound in the centre of her stomach. \"Every time I have a bath I remember when I was injured. I am angry with the soldiers. Why did they do this? I didn't do anything. I was in school.\" </p> <p>Hamas won't need to teach these kids how to graduate from throwing balls to throwing stones and bombs; they are learning all they need to learn about violence from the Israeli Defence Force. </p> <p>All the children have their stories. Leaa Hussein Najim is 10. \"At 7.30 in the morning the Israeli bulldozers started destroying our house fence. The walls started falling. Big rocks fell down on my leg and it was injured. I was not able to stand on it. My mother carried me while my father carried my grandmother, but he fell down because he was in a hurry. Afterwards I went back. I didn't know where our house was. Everything was under destruction, my books and uniforms.\" </p> <p>Aya Al-Shaer is 13. \"We felt very afraid. My father said to the bulldozer: 'Please give me time to take our furniture out of the house.' But the bulldozer didn't agree, and started shooting at my father. He was shot in the back and the leg.\" </p> <p>The stories go on. Rouan said she \"sleeps with tears every night\". Another boy from the Brazil area of Rafah returned to search out his clothes and books among the rubble. Finding nothing, he went to school in his pyjamas. </p> <p>A few hundred yards from six-storey concrete flats, along the ironically named Philadelphi road, a huge Israeli barrier spreads its concrete wings along the length of Rafah. We picked our way through the chewed-up wreckage created by tanks and bulldozers. </p> <p>And then, out of nowhere, without us having crossed any sort of line and with no warning, a machine gun from the nearest watch-tower opened fire. As we dropped to the ground and scattered, a woman in a nearby tenement continued to hang out her washing. She had seen it all before. </p> <p>Despite all this, children continue to play. The Gaza strip is one of the most densely populated places on the planet and the majority of the population is under 16. The local zoo may have been destroyed, the football field is far too dangerous, and the beach has been appropriated by settlers and soldiers. Some play football in the cemetery. In Gaza, death is never very far away.</p>",
  "When locals hear of another shooting in Nottingham, they assume it was in St Ann's. Usually, they are right. The troubled district has become synonymous with increasingly vicious gun violence that police and local people seem powerless to prevent. <p>Forty years ago, residents say, they could leave the door of their Victorian terraces on the latch. Now CCTV cameras keep an unceasing watch on the gloomy, rubbish-strewn footpaths created by the decision to replace thousands of terrace homes with a labyrinthine network of low-rise, high-density flats in the 1970s.</p> <p>By the 1980s crime and vandalism were a growing problem, despite work to improve street lighting.</p> <p>Feuding drug gangs brought guns into the city and in February 2000 armed response vehicles began routine patrols of St Ann's. In October 2000, after 14 serious shootings in several months, Nottingham became the first city in Britain to experience routine armed foot patrols by police. Operation Real Estate focused on St Ann's and the Meadows estates.</p> <p>However, there were more shooting incidents in the city in 2002 than in all the seven previous years combined, including the murder of 16-year-old Brendon Lawrence in St Ann's. In 2003, there was on average more than one shooting every week in Nottinghamshire.</p> <p>Armed patrols were withdrawn from St Ann's this year as other approaches were tried. David Blunkett, the home secretary, visited Nottingham last year to launch a gun amnesty, and 600 weapons were handed in at police stations in a month. Police even used Nottingham's pirate radio stations to spread an anti-gun message.</p> <p>It failed to halt the growth of revenge attacks by gangs seeking to protect their trade in crack and heroin.</p> <p>On many occasions, innocent people have fallen victim of gun crime, which police have described as a pernicious form of \"urban terrorism\" designed to deter victims from testifying against their attackers. </p> <p>In July, Gerald Smith, a bystander, was shot dead in the doorway of a nightclub after nine members of a Nottingham drugs gang travelled to Sheffield to seek revenge on another gang who robbed them.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Derek Senior was shot outside his Nottingham home a week after giving evidence against a gang accused of viciously attacking him.</p> <p>In October last year, Marian Bates, 64, was shot dead as she defended her daughter from an armed robber during a raid on her jewellery store.</p>",

  "The contest for the White House was locked in a dead heat yesterday, with Republican and Democratic strategists looking to the third and last debate to score the convincing victory that could alter the dynamics of the race. <p>With just three weeks until voting day, the gap between George Bush and John Kerry has narrowed significantly. </p> <p>An ABC television poll conducted after Friday night's debate in Missouri and released yesterday put Mr Bush marginally ahead with 50% support compared with 46% for Mr Kerry, but still within the margins of error. </p> <p>That tightening of the race elevates the importance of Wednesday's debate in Arizona as the last, best chance for either candidate to take a decisive lead. </p> <p>With that debate, the focus of the campaigns shifts from Iraq to domestic issues, where the Democrats believe they have an advantage. </p> <p>\"We have to, number one, focus on making sure the American people know what's happened over the last four years,\" the vice-presidential candidate, John Edwards, said yesterday morning in one of several appearances on the weekend chatshows. </p> <p>Mr Edwards said Mr Bush had presided over historic job losses and a worsening economy, charges the Democrats plan to amplify in the run-up to the debate. </p> <p>Although two instant polls crowned Mr Kerry the winner of Friday night's clash in Missouri, the victory was not so decisive as to reverse the Republicans' overall edge. </p> <p>For his part Mr Bush was far more in command of his material than during his dismal performance in the first debate, and he held his temper largely in check, replacing the angry scowls with a studiously blank expression. </p> <p>The Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg said Mr Kerry had improved his \"likeability quotient\", especially among uncommitted voters. \"He clearly established a sense of confidence and likeability and made possible these gains in personal favourability which, I believe, will translate into vote changes during the next week,\" the pollster said. </p> <p>Now that the Democratic candidate has established a presidential demeanour with his two solid debate performances, he must work to convince the American people that he shares their concerns about jobs and healthcare. \"We are going to find that John Kerry is a fighter for the middle classes,\" said Joe Lockhart, a senior campaign adviser. </p> <p>Mr Kerry, meanwhile, picked up on one of the most pointed exchanges of Friday night, when Mr Bush refused to answer a woman who had asked for three examples of mistakes made by his administration. \"Do we want leadership - as it's called - that can't face reality and admit mistakes?\" Mr Kerry asked a Democratic rally in Ohio. </p> <p>But the president has been just as active in setting out the parameters of Wednesday's debate. With Iraq on the sidelines for now, Mr Bush has abandoned momentarily the \"flip-flop\" label that has dogged Mr Kerry throughout the campaign to focus on making the case that the Democratic candidate is a tax-and-spend liberal. </p> <p>Mr Bush used the \"liberal\" epithet four times in Missouri, and stayed with the theme in campaign appearances at the weekend. In the mid west battleground states of Iowa and Minnesota, Mr Bush moved to cast the Democratic challenger as a high-spending liberal who would raise taxes to pay for government welfare programmes. Mr Kerry \"can run but can't hide\" from his past support for tax increases, Mr Bush repeatedly said. </p> <p>The Republicans have homed in on Mr Kerry's healthcare plan, saying it would create an unwieldy government bureaucracy. \"If you like the DMV [department of motor vehicles] and you want to get that for your healthcare, you're going to love the Kerry plan,\" Mr Bush's campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, said yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Edwards has also become a target. A millionaire trial attorney before entering politics, he has become a convenient focus for Republican charges that health costs have escalated because of lawsuits. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Kerry was out courting the crucial black vote yesterday. He attended two church services in Miami, one with Haitian Catholics and the other with black Baptists, where the Rev Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton tied his election to the civil rights struggle. \"We have an unfinished march in this nation,\" Associated Press reported Mr Kerry as saying at the Friendship Missionary Baptist church. </p> <p>\"Never again will a million African Americans be denied the right to exercise their vote in the United States,\" he added, referring to the disputed Florida recount in the 2000 presidential race. </p> <p>Black turnout is key to Mr Kerry winning in Florida and elsewhere - less than 10% of black voters nationally supported Mr Bush in 2000.</p>",
  "<p>An unexpected sight greets the holidaymaker out for a gentle cruise on the 186-mile Lake Powell in Arizona. A mile or so upriver from the Glen Canyon dam stand red and green channel markers to guide those on the water. But the signs planted in the riverbank are of little use today: thanks to a drought which is entering its sixth year, the lake's water level has dropped by 40 metres (130ft), leaving the signs on each bank stranded at the top of a cliff. </p> <p>Steve Ward, who works for a tourism company, steers his motorboat into a bay and points to an island across the sparkling blue water. \"Normally we'd go across there to leave the bay,\" he says, \"Right now we can't, because there's land in the way.\" </p> <p>That land, like the many newly emerged beaches dotted around the lake, would normally be under 30 metres of water. </p> <p>Lake Powell, the second largest reservoir in the US, which fills the canyons straddling the border between Utah and Arizona, is an important link in the chain of water supply drawn from the Colorado river. So the falling water levels are not just a story of a tourist attraction facing tough times, but an environmental problem that may have a fundamental impact on life in seven of the states of the western US, notably the thirsty states of California, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico. </p> <p>That supply keeps agriculture in the south-west of the US irrigated, provides for the needs of industry, keeps lawns sprinkled and green, and enables people to wash their cars and themselves. Without the water from the Colorado river most of the west would revert to its natural state: a desert. </p> <p>This year the drought has hit home, causing alarm among the community of scientists, technicians and bureaucrats whose job it is to slake the thirst of the west. </p> <p>\"If the drought continues it will force the states to sit down and take some truly tough decisions,\" says Ken Rice, the manager of the dam, who works for the government's bureau of reclamation. \"It really depends on what mother nature does over the next few years.\" </p> <p>The threat of the drought is made tangible by the declining lake levels. Further down the Colorado river near Las Vegas, at Lake Mead - the biggest reservoir in the US, created by the Hoover dam - the remains of a once submerged village are starting to emerge. </p> <p>At Lake Powell, the \"bathtub ring\", a white mark left on the orange sandstone of the canyon by the receding lake, provides a jarring reminder of where the water should be, and a handy indicator that the lake is just 38% full, with a level of 1,088 metres. </p> <p>When the lake drops to 1,064 metres, it will have reached the minimum level at which the two power stations that use its water can operate safely, and the lake will effectively be decomissioned. </p> <p>Pictures of the Lake Powell Lodge at Wahweap - literally \"bitter water\", the lake's largest resort - show it perched on the shore, water lapping at its foundations. Today it is a third of a mile from the water's edge. </p> <p>The concrete launch ramp built to enable the thousands of holidaymakers who come to Wahweap each year to put their houseboats, dinghies, speedboats and jetskis on to the lake stops about 10 metres short of the water. It has been extended twice in the past year, and in August a system of welded steel tubes was laid into the water to provide additional access. The total cost of bringing the tourists back to the water's edge at Wahweap has been $5m (\u00a32.8m). </p> <p>But with the level of the lake falling by 53cm (20in) a week, unless there is significant rainfall between now and the spring, and unless the snowmelt that contributes most of the water increases on recent years, the ramp will have to be extended again for next year. </p> <p>\"We've been releasing more water than has been coming in, due to our legal obligations,\" says Mr Rice, turning to look out of his office window on top of the dam. </p> <p>The legal obligations explain why the drought could have a profound impact on the way water is used as far away as California. </p> <p>The Colorado river is the subject of a complex series of contracts and compacts dating back to 1922. Known as the law of the river, they establish a hierarchy of demand on the Colorado's water, with California having the greatest say. </p> <p>Should the water start to dry up and real cuts in supply be made, other states will lose their supply before California, which receives some 14% of its water from the river. Water trading and legal fees are the most likely outcome of any attempt to implement the law of the river. </p> <p>\"Our role is to make the states understand that if they don't get their act together, we will step in,\" says Bennett Raley, assistant secretary for water and science at the US interior department, which oversees the bureau of reclamation. </p> <p>Mr Raley, who has been going to water meetings since he was 11, says the drought should make people change the way they think about and use water, and that farming in the west should look both at its practices and at its choice of crops. </p> <p>\"People say that the west has obviously grown out of its water supply and must stop growing,\" he says. \"That's reasonable on the face of it, but not true. The issue in time of drought is what will be the relationship between irrigated agriculture and the cities. The secretary of the interior does not have the legal authority to say, 'Needs have changed, we're going to reallocate water from agriculture to urban use.' The view of this administration is that the market is the best way to make those changes.\" </p> <p>But some argue that the reservoir should simply be allowed to drain away. \"Glen Canyon dam and Lake Powell are unnecessary and counterproductive for the water needs of the west,\" says Chris Peterson of the Glen Canyon Institute. </p> <p>\"They've destroyed one of the most beautiful places in the world. We're in a water management crisis. We're dealing with a system that is 50 years old. It's like a 57 Chevy. </p> <p>\"Since that time, America has started to appreciate its wildlife, and we've also realised that there are better ways of storing water. We live in a desert. There's plenty of water - the question is who gets it and how is it stored.\" </p> <p>He predicts that if the drought continues (and some say that it is not a drought, but a return to normal conditions after a 50-year wet period), any attempt to enact the law of the river will become mired in litigation. </p> <p>Mr Ward starts to climb the steep slope from the water's edge to the latest temporary car park. \"I choose to be optimistic and tell people there's things we haven't seen for 30 years, come and see them before they're covered up,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I don't consider this drought to be a danger to Lake Powell as much as it is to the west of America. If this is a 30-year drought, things are going to have to change all over America.\"</p>",
  "A sunny day in Rome. A table in the open with its own umbrella. A plate of pasta, a glass of wine, and a view of one of Europe's most glorious monuments. <p>The only problem is no one else will be able glimpse more than fragments of the monument because of all the other open-air tables, each with its own huge umbrella and bevy of customers. </p> <p>Several squares in central Rome have turned into virtual extensions of the surrounding bars and restaurants in recent years. Now the guardians of the city's heritage have decided the time has come for a war on the encroaching white tablecloths. </p> <p>City council officials will resume a piazza-by-piazza inspection of the centre today, and will define, down to the last centimetre, how much of its cobbled surface may be given over to open-air catering. </p> <p>The aim is to ensure that visitors who do not choose to pay the inflated prices that go with open-air food and drink still get a proper view of the city's cultural treasures. </p> <p>Among \"black spots\" already identified is the Piazza della Rotonda in front of the Pan theon. A writer for the newspaper Corriere della Sera counted 277 tables and 734 chairs arrayed in front of the classical world's largest domed building last week. The Piazza della Rotonda, she said, had become a \"square that resembles a canteen.\" </p> <p>The official in charge of the clampdown, Gennaro Farina, said the area hidden under tables and chairs would be halved, at least. \"Occupation of publicly owned surfaces will be at the very most 10-15% of the available area,\" he said. \"Today, it is 30%.\" </p> <p>Already, though, the city's restaurateurs and barkeepers are preparing for a fight. A spokesman damned the project as the work of \"a committee of bureaucrats who have decided the catering business is at the root of all evil.\" </p> <p>He said: \"No decision taken without consultation will be accepted.\" </p> <p>Renting space on a Roman piazza must be among the best investments on the planet. The right to extend your business on to a leading tourist venue like Piazza Navona costs a mere \u20ac100 (\u00a365) per square metre per year. Elsewhere, the price drops to \u20ac70. </p> <p>Yet many tenants are in arrears. Until recently the bor ough that covers most of the centre of Rome was owed \u20ac3m (\u00a32m) in rent. </p> <p>A lot of bar and restaurant owners do not even ask before moving their furniture into the open. An investigation launched five years ago found police and local officials had been taking bribes in exchange for agreeing not to notice extra tables and chairs. </p> <p>Since then the law has been applied with more rigour. In the first nine months of this year 878 fines were imposed for illegal occupation of publicly owned space. </p>",
  "<p>Tugan Sokhiev may have bowed out as music director of Welsh National Opera but, that episode apart, things aren't going so badly in his career. His relationship with the Philharmonia seems comfortable, and his expressive approach to the Russian orchestral repertoire was evident in this programme.</p> <p>The brief tone poem The Enchanted Lake prompted a mental salute to its composer, Anatol Liadov: we owe him our thanks for not fulfilling Diaghilev's commission for the Firebird ballet and allowing Stravinsky to step into the breach. There's an element of prevarication in the score, of Liadov being afraid to dip his toes into icy waters full of foreboding rather than fairytale charm.</p> <p>Sokhiev brought out the sinister mood, and the glint of harp and celeste that suggests that something might develop, though it never does. But Liadov's darkness was a good foil for the exotic colouring of Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade, with the characterisation of the cruel sultan strongly delivered by the brass heavies, and leader James Clark making Scheherazade's insinuating lines cast a subtle spell.</p> <p>Sokhiev conducted with assurance, but pulled the tempi about in a way that may have showed control but didn't add to the music - indeed, sometimes detracted from its implicit momentum.</p> <p>It was in the partnership with soloist Simon Trpceski in Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto that sparks flew. This was as muscular a performance as might be expected from two young lions vying for supremacy, with the emphasis on the work's fiery rhythmic character even more potent than usual. Trpceski's pianism is formidable, but the furious pace of the finale made for some mad scrambles.</p> <p>Perhaps conscious of that, the reflective melancholy of his Tchaikovsky encore, October from The Seasons, offered poetry to balance the rhetoric.</p>",

  "More than 1,000 of the 2,500 immigration and asylum advisers in Britain may be \"struck off\" by next April because of problems surrounding a new state accreditation scheme, the Law Centres Federation has warned. <p>The scheme, designed to put cowboy advisers out of business, is in danger of driving away many experienced experts as well. </p> <p>Publicly funded immigration solicitors and advisers must pass a two-day exam, being held in London, Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester and Newcastle on three dates in September, November and next February. </p> <p>The federation says it is concerned that many will fail to qualify under the scheme run by the Legal Services Commission and the Law Society before the deadline in April. </p> <p>It argues that the timescale is unrealistic because the exam is being offered only intermittently at select locations that lack the necessary facilities. </p> <p>Only a few hundred appeared to have passed so far, its director, Steve Hynes, said. It was necessary to weed out the cowboys, but the effect, combined with the time restriction on legal aid work, was to severely restrict what private practice solicitors could do, he added. </p> <p>Sarah Hall, an immigration solicitor who recently left Bury law centre to practise criminal law, said the scheme was the \"final nail in the coffin\". </p> <p>\"From last April when the changes came in, I have spent more time applying for funding and appealing against refusals of funding than I have actually doing legal work on the cases,\" she said. </p> <p>Crispin Passmore, the head of immigration services at the Legal Services Commission, said the scheme was a fundamental part of the drive to guarantee good quality publicly funded asylum and immigration advice. He said there was sufficient capacity to assess up to 4,000 applicants. </p> <p>\"It is for the advisers themselves to decide when they sit the assessment.

  "The president of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian, attempted to restart peace talks with Beijing yesterday, calling for an arms control agreement and a new code of conduct to dispel the \"dark forces\" threatening cross-strait relations. <p>In his most conciliatory speech since taking office in 2000, the independence-minded leader said he was ready to resume negotiations after a five-year gap, on the basis of a previous agreement he had earlier rejected. </p> <p>The National Day address, which also included praise for China's reforms, appeared aimed at striking up a new relationship with the mainland, which views Taiwan as a renegade province that must be reunited by force if necessary. </p> <p>It comes less than a month after a major shift in Beijing's leadership, under which the former president Jiang Zemin - considered a hardliner on the issue of Taiwan - gave up control of the military to the current leader, Hu Jintao, who has stressed the need for a \"peaceful rise\" for China. </p> <p>Commentators warned earlier this year that the threat of war was greater than at any time in a decade. </p> <p>Mr Chen accused China of targeting Taiwan with 600 ballistic missiles, but called on both sides to step back from the brink. \"The threat of military force represents the greatest shadow of terror and forces of darkness across the Taiwan Strait,\" he said. \"Therefore, I propose that both sides should seriously consider the issue of arms control and take concrete actions to reduce tension and military threats.\" </p> <p>He called for confidence-building measures, including a new code of conduct and the reassertion of the negotiating principles laid down in 1992 when Taiwan and China accepted the principle that they were \"one country\", but agreed to differ about their interpretation of what that implied. </p> <p>Mr Chen had rejected this fudge, but said yesterday it was a \"not necessarily perfect, but acceptable\" basis for the resumption of dialogue. </p> <p>But he also said that his government would push ahead with plans to buy \u00a310bn of arms from the United States and reform the constitution, a move that China has warned could lead to war. </p> <p>Beijing has yet to respond, but it is likely to remain suspicious about the intentions of Mr Chen, whose core supporters favour independence.</p>",
  "Politics is curiously conservative in its areas of interest. It can take a generation for the need for change to move from pressure group to party policy (remember the slow and uneven progress on environmental issues). This disconnection may help to explain why a poll at the end of the party conference season last week showed just 2% pay attention to the politicians' seaside jaunts. It may also help to explain why Tony Blair's government survives disaster. Labour tells the most coherent story in the areas of public life of greatest concern - health, education and now the family. <p>It is the significance of family policy that the main opposition parties have yet to grasp. In their conference speeches, both prime minister and chancellor flagged up initiatives such as the extended school day, flexible working and the extension of parental leave, subjects on which Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy were notably silent. Neither Tories nor Lib Dems at the top have yet understood how coping with these issues dominates the lives of the 50% of the workforce whose children are under 18. And not even Labour devotes enough time to explaining why this is not merely a legitimate but an essential sphere of government activity. </p> <p>It is a familiar truth, highlighted by the new alliance between child poverty and pensioner campaigners, that children who are born into poor households go on to underachieve at school, miss out on higher education and grow old in poor households too, while poor grandparents are likely to lack the resources to help their children go out to work, or offer role models for their grandchildren. The solutions are complex, but the message is plain: tackle child poverty effectively and in the long term you tackle pensioner poverty, too. The poorest children live in workless and single-parent households. But Sure Start, children's centres and wraparound childcare, now to be implemented on a national scale, are not the product of right-on feminism nor of Gordon Brown's determination to make everyone economically active. They are essential preconditions for a society in which there is genuine choice and in which everyone can prosper. </p> <p>The other more familiar truth is that women, poor or rich, professional or unskilled, earn less than men. The presumption of interrupted working lives undermines women's earning capacity even in an era when they make up the majority of entrants to medicine and the law. First enabling and then encouraging fathers to share the care of their children with paid paternal leave is as significant a symbol as the anti-discrimination legislation of the 70s. Yet all the Tories have to say on this is that in divorce, regardless of the unhappy evidence that it is still the exception, co-parenting should be assumed and fathers should have equal access to their children with their mothers. Lib Dems say nothing at all. </p> <p>Labour women worked for a generation in opposition - and for seven years in government - to make family policy part of the political mainstream. It is an unintended irony now that the identification of their policies with the left adds to the opposition's reluctance to get to grips with them. The Tory spokeswoman, Eleanor Laing, can barely disguise her boredom with her brief, while the Lib Dems have only just realised they don't have a policy at all on what the government is planning to make a central plank of its election campaign. This dearth of political imagination may explain why polls show that the Conservatives have, for the first time ever, fewer women supporting them than men, and why, despite the sense of betrayal over Iraq, women are still more likely to vote Labour if they vote at all. But in this dominance there is a long-term danger: for these policies to prosper, the first condition is an acceptance of government's role.</p>",
  "This is the story of a suicide. It is the story of a boy who spent the last days of his short, troubled life in the strip cell of a British prison. For much of that time he was naked, covered only by a loose-fitting garment, something like a horse blanket; it was heavy, it chafed the skin, it was demeaning to wear, and when it was produced at the inquest there was a visible reaction from the coroner and jurors, perhaps because they were unable to believe that, in the 21st century, this is the garb in to which the state forces vulnerable children in its care. <p>During the nine days he survived prison, the boy was for the most part completely isolated. He was depressed, frightened and uncommunicative. He had scars on the bridge of his nose, on his chin and on his arms, injuries which, over the years, he had inflicted on himself. Then, on Sunday March 24 2002, he wrote a note to his parents and attached a noose to the bars of a cell window. His body was discovered by Steve Cowdell, a maintenance worker, who had been called in to investigate a problem with blocked toilets. Cowdell took the boy's weight, untied the knot and lowered him to the floor. By then John Joseph Scholes, known by his family as Joe, was almost certainly already braindead. He was 16 years and one month old. The note he left read: \"I love you mum and dad. I'm sorry, I just can't cope. Don't be sad. It is no one's fault. I just can't go on. None of it was any of your fault, sorry. Love you and family, Joe.\" To which he added an angry postscript: \"I tried telling them and they just don't fucking listen, the wankers.\" </p> <p>Beyond the personal tragedy for Joe and those who knew and loved him, there is a larger story. This concerns our prisons, obviously, and what goes on inside their walls. It also concerns our politicians, including - very directly in Joe's case - the home secretary, David Blunkett, and the now familiar blunt-speaking, high-profile forays into the law and order debate in which he seems to delight so much. It concerns our leading judges, including - also very directly - the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, and how the judiciary responds to political and media pressure. </p> <p>And it concerns us, as a society, for if Joe's death does anything, it throws an unwelcome spotlight on our appetite for punishment, for seeing it inflicted, for tolerating its severity, on our apparent ease at consigning those like Joe to the far reaches of our consciousness, where they are neither seen nor heard, sending them, in effect, to our own mental strip cells. Some might complain that this is too bleak a view, but were it otherwise, Joseph Scholes would not have died, alone and frightened, hanging from the bars of a cell window. </p> <p>By any measure, Joe was a terribly disturbed boy. He was born on February 20 1986 in Sale, a pleasant, residential suburb of Manchester, where his mother, Yvonne, was also born. However, in 1997 Yvonne's marriage broke down, and she had to sell their house and move the family - Joe, his two older sisters and his younger brother, Jack - to Wythenshawe to live on a council estate. </p> <p>Yvonne describes Joe as always having been young for his age. At 14 and 15, he was still climbing trees and building dens. She had earlier begun to notice relatively minor injuries on his body, but these Joe explained away as scrapes and bumps caused during play. However, the injuries soon worsened and Yvonne came to the unpleasant realisation that her son was deliberately harming himself. At the inquest into Joe's death, held in Shrewsbury in April this year, Yvonne laid out for the coroner and the jury a horrific catalogue of self-abuse. She described how Joe would drive sharp implements far down into his nails, causing his toes to go septic. The pain was excruciating, but nothing Yvonne could do would persuade him to accept medical attention. He also inflicted deep cuts to his face, on one occasion scoring the bridge of his nose so severely that he cut it down to the bone. </p> <p>Like many boys on the verge of puberty, Joe developed an obsession with his body, getting angry if his mother or sisters disturbed him in the bathroom. He would, Yvonne recalls, spend up to four hours in the bath. Additionally, and again not unusually in boys of his age, there was an element of anxiety about his sexuality, which Joe expressed in violent rants against gays (and which Yvonne linked to allegations of abuse - never proved - by a family member). By the age of 14, Joe was smoking cannabis and truanting. \"He used to call me stupid,\" Yvonne says, \"for allowing the family to live in a council house and that his father was living in a big house. He told us that he was going to kill his father and his grandmother. He would rant and rave, just being angry with everyone.\" He was already talking, \"of taking the coward's way out\". </p> <p>Joe stopped eating family meals. His obsession with cleanliness turned into complete disregard as he refused to wash, and he would come in late at night smelling of alcohol. He began to hide scissors and kitchen knives in his bedroom. Yvonne would see him standing at his bedroom door, holding a knife over his head, which he would then bring down to his stomach. In the autumn of 2000, 14-year-old Joe began making threats against his mother, telling her that he wanted to dismember and burn her. \"I just told Joseph not to be so silly and to calm down,\" Yvonne says. He also threatened to stab his infant brother, Jack. When Yvonne intervened, he stabbed his mother's coat, which was folded over her arm. After such outbursts, Joe would break down and cry and apologise for his behaviour. \"He would say, 'I don't know why I do what I do'.\" </p> <p>Joe was beset by irrational fears. \"He would come into my bedroom at least 10 times a night,\" Yvonne says. He was scared of the dark. \"When he wanted to walk from his bedroom-light switch to his bed, he would shout at me continuously for comfort.\" He developed a phobia about insects and would check every corner of a room he had entered to make sure that it was free of them. He began to write rambling letters about black holes and plagued his mother with unanswerable questions. \"He could not understand why I could not understand him.\" </p> <p>Yvonne sought psychiatric help. On one occasion, she recalls, Joe suddenly grabbed the steering wheel of the car as they were on their way to an appointment with the psychiatrist, causing the car to veer across the road. </p> <p>Yvonne Scholes is an articulate, intelligent and caring woman who faced up to Joe's problems with courage and love. But, at the end of her tether and with three other children to care for (including one - Jack - with learning difficulties), the time came when she could no longer cope. In October 2001, Joe went to live with his father. However, after only six weeks, Joe's father, likewise unable to cope with his son's disruptive behaviour, had to ask him to leave. There was a brief altercation in his father's house, the police were called and Joe was later made the subject of a supervision order. In November 2001, Joe was discovered by police sleeping rough and was taken into care by Manchester social services. </p> <p>Yvonne has nothing but praise for the Northenden Road children's centre in Sale. The building itself was bright, modern and purpose-built, and backed on to a park. The staff, she says, were \"pleasant and kind\" and \"showed humanity and caring\" towards Joe, in marked contrast, she says, to the prison staff into whose care Joe would soon be entrusted. </p> <p>On December 6, just a week after his arrival in the children's centre, Joe went out with four young people - two boys and two girls - from the home. While at Northenden Road, staff were later to say, Joe was well-mannered and polite, but was withdrawn and kept himself to himself. So when an offer of companionship eventually came, an invitation to go out for the night, he found it difficult to resist. Joe and his companions bought vodka, which they drank. They then boarded the metro link. A separate, mixed group of teenage friends, who had just spent the evening bowling, also got on the train. Both sets got off at Brookland station in Sale. Joe's companions split into two, males in one group, females in the other. The female group approached the girls and demanded their mobile phones. When one of the victims insisted that she didn't have one, one of the girl robbers said aggressively, \"Yes, you fucking have,\" and told them to empty their pockets. A watch was snatched from the wrist of one of the victims, two \u00a310 notes were handed over, and one of the victims was struck across the face, causing her nose to bleed. While this was going on, the male group approached the boys. Again, the victims were asked for their mobile phones. One boy was patted down before moving off but was then, without warning, punched in the side of the face. Another of the victims was threatened if he did not hand over his wallet. For the victims, it was a frightening and very distressing experience. </p> <p>Later that night, the police came to the children's centre at Northenden Road, where they recovered some of the stolen property. Joe and his companions were arrested. Yvonne was not informed of these events for some days. When she found out, she was deeply shocked. Joe was reluctant to discuss what happened, insisting to Yvonne that he had no idea when he left the home that night that the other children would do what they did, and he was adamant that he did not take part in the actual robbery. </p> <p>Of course, it is usual for those accused of offences to try to minimise their culpability. However, at the subsequent trial at Minshull Street crown court, Manchester, on March 15 2002, the prosecution accepted that although he was present, Joe took no physical part in any of the robberies. \"Joseph Scholes,\" the prosecutor told the judge, \"offered no physical violence to any person on December 6 2001.\" </p> <p>On the basis of what she had heard, Yvonne expected Joe to get a community service order. She had seen Joe five days before the trial, on Mother's Day, when they met at Yvonne's mother's house in Sale. Joe, she said, talked a lot about the past and was very sentimental. He was \"utterly nervous about what was going to happen\", but he would not let Yvonne or his sisters attend the trial, threatening to run away if he saw them there. Yvonne agreed not to go, not wanting to upset him further or make things worse. </p> <p>Yvonne recalls standing by her car outside her mother's house that day. She offered Joe a lift back to the children's centre but he didn't want one. \"He hugged me very tightly. I put my head into his neck and told him I loved him.\" Joe walked away and Yvonne, by then in tears, got into the car with Jack and her daughters. She had driven only a little way when she passed Joe sitting on a wall. She stopped and this time he agreed to get in. She dropped him further on, hugging him again, kissing him. \"We drove off,\" she says, \"and tooted the horn and waved to him.\" It was the last time she was to see her son alive. </p> <p>It is at this point that David Blunkett and Lord Woolf enter the story of Joseph Scholes. </p> <p>By now it seems clear that the home secretary enjoys his reputation as the bete noire of those he dismisses as \"Hampstead liberals\", preferring the company of the likes of Paul Dacre, editor of the Daily Mail, whom he recently toasted as the best journalist of his generation. And like Dacre's newspaper, Blunkett's rhetoric is unapologetically aggressive and authoritarian. He revels in promises of \"tougher action\", \"cracking down\", \"smashing gangs\", \"stamping out crime\" and \"banging away people for a very long time\". In a speech at the annual prison service conference in Nottingham, delivered the month before Joe Scholes went on trial, the home secretary focused on violent street crime, which, he claimed, was affecting the \"psyche of the nation\". Carjackers, he said, would be put away for \"as long as I can make it stick\". And, ominously for Joe, he publicly backed Lord Woolf's call, made the previous month, for all mobile phone thieves to be sent to prison. </p> <p>The lord chief justice does not share Blunkett's crass, in-your-face populism, and he is admired by many civil liberties lawyers. However, in January 2001, one month after the robbery at Brooklands station in Sale, and two months before Joe would go on trial, Britain's senior judge, sitting in London, re-examined the case of two muggers, referred to the court of appeal by Lord Goldsmith, the attorney general, after the original sentences were deemed \"unduly lenient\". Increasing the sentence of one of the muggers from six months to three and a half years, Woolf said that a custodial sentence \"will be the only option available\", save in exceptional circumstances. The lowest appropriate sentence, he said, was 18 months, the maximum, five years. </p> <p>Many observers of the legal scene were surprised by what Woolf had done. Only the year before, he had spoken at length about the urgent need to reduce the prison population, and he appealed to politicians on all sides to stop playing \"the prison card\". Prison numbers, as Martin Narey, the director general of the prison service, said in response to Blunkett's latest \"get tough\" policy, were going up by more than 700 a week. \"We are struggling to cope with the insanity of a prison population which is hurtling towards 70,000,\" he said. Narey might also have added that we are locking up record numbers of women and we are, in the home secretary's favoured phrase, banging up more children than ever before. </p> <p>Even the most die-hard supporters of get- tough policy-making have to acknowledge that this kind of zero tolerance approach cannot, by its very nature, take account of individual circumstances. There is collateral damage. So the minute Woolf delivered his judgment in the court of appeal, Joe Scholes was sentenced to death. </p> <p>Yvonne remembers the day of Joe's trial. It was Friday, March 15 2002. Forbidden by Joe to attend, she had waited anxiously at home. She kept ringing the children's centre to ask if there had been a verdict. As the day wore on, she became increasingly distressed, crying all the time. In the early evening, a member of staff called to tell her that Joe had been sentenced to a two-year detention and training order. She \"could not believe - and cannot believe to this day - that any humane, reasonable person could have given someone like Joe a custodial sentence\". </p> <p>Everyone - Joe's social workers, his psychiatrist, his lawyers - had told the judge, Mr Justice Lever, in the most unequivocal terms that there was a very high risk Joe would kill himself if he went to jail. The judge ignored their warning. \"It is an unhappy fact that these serious offences of street robbery are against a background of anxiety and fear the length and breadth of this country,\" he said, \"and only in the last couple of weeks, the lord chief justice has said what has always been the policy in my court, that is that people who go around terrifying people, committing street robberies, receive immediate custodial sentences.\" </p> <p>Even though he had been sentenced to detention, the authorities did not have to send Joe to prison. He could instead have been allocated to a local authority secure unit, where at least he would have had better chances of receiving the care he so desperately needed. However, there is a chronic shortage of rooms in secure units - they are expensive and, put brutally, prison is the cheaper option - and so Joe was taken to Stoke Heath Young Offenders Institute, near Market Drayton in Shropshire, a decision whose appropriateness was later questioned by the internal prison department report into Joe's death. The same report said that Stoke Heath's healthcare centre, into which Joe was received, \"is recognised as inadequate and unacceptable. Although funding has been approved for building a new facility, the governor is unclear about timescales due to difficulties in clarifying from where the required funding will come.\" </p> <p>Once Yvonne was over the initial shock, she rang the prison on the Saturday and Sunday and was assured that all was well. She spoke on the phone to Joe and asked for a visiting order, which duly arrived on the following Thursday. Yvonne made plans to travel from North Wales, where she had bought a house and was now living with her daughters and Jack. Meanwhile, she wrote to Joe every day. He sounded, \"sad, upset, shocked, frightened. He was being brave, for us, he didn't want to upset us, but he told the prison staff he couldn't cope.\" Joseph Scholes was entering the last week of his life. </p> <p>What went on during that week was examined in some length during the inquest. Prison staff, questioned by Karon Monaghan, the barrister acting on behalf of Yvonne, who was greatly assisted by Deborah Coles of the campaigning organisation Inquest and her solicitor, Mark Scott, admitted that, yes, Stoke Heath had been the subject of a highly critical report by the prisons inspectorate in 2000, but they pointed out that an inspection the following year had commended staff on subsequent improvements. </p> <p>There also was a bit of a to-do over what constituted a \"strip cell\". A strip cell is a room with basic fixed furniture, and without normal bedding or any creature comforts - television, radio, family photographs, posters and so forth. It is, if not entirely bare, then depressingly and oppressively sterile. In theory, the use of strip cells in the management of those thought to be at risk of suicide or self-harm was eliminated by prison service order 2000/2700. </p> <p>The head of healthcare at Stoke Heath, Dominic Donaldson, accepted that strip conditions, which are likely to be challenged under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, were \"utterly untherapeutic\" and did not lessen suicidal feelings. Prisoners, he conceded, often felt worse for the experience, feeling degraded and punished. However, he denied that there was any such thing as a strip cell in the healthcare centre of Stoke Heath. What he had, Donaldson insisted, were \"safe cells\". After sustained questioning by Monaghan, it became clear that the difference between a \"safe\" and a \"strip\" cell was entirely semantic. Strip cells had been abolished simply by changing the name. The same was true of \"strip clothing\". Were the jurors who looked over this degrading garment imagining one of their own children being forced to wear it? They certainly looked shocked. Donaldson rejected Monaghan's claim that this was in fact \"strip clothing\". It is \"referred to as safe clothing\", he insisted. \"Some staff refer to them as strip because that is old terminology. In my time I have said it's safe clothing and that's what it is.\" </p> <p>Too often with arguments like this, you can lose sight of the wood because there are just too many trees, and too often they end up obscuring the central point. And the central - and unmissable - point here was surely that if the parents or guardians of a 16-year-old boy were to keep him in a strip cell or safe cell, with only a horseblanket to dress in, they would be prosecuted for cruelty. Yet it's legal for the state to do it. </p> <p>Joseph Scholes repeatedly told prison staff that he would kill himself. And that's exactly what he did. At approximately 3.20pm on March 24 2002, Joe's body was found hanging from the bars of his cell window. He was taken by air ambulance to North Staffordshire hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival. </p> <p>Yvonne was making sandwiches and looking at the map with one of her daughters, trying to work out how to get to Shropshire from their new home in North Wales when there was a knock on the door. It was about 7pm. It was a local policeman. He asked if she was Yvonne Scholes. She answered yes. He asked if she was alone. Yvonne said her daughter was here. \"It just clicked into place,\" she says. \"I remember running off from him into the house screaming, 'He's dead, he's dead!' It was shocking for Joanna and Jack. The policeman followed me into the house. I feel sad for him, he was trying to talk but Joanna and I were running to the bathroom and being sick, falling down on the floor, screaming at the policeman that they'd promised to look after him. </p> <p>\"The policeman was very kind,\" she says. \"He stayed 20 minutes, and gave me the phone number of Shrewsbury CID. There was nothing he could do. We were lucky to have such a kind officer.\" </p> <p>Yvonne sees the pain of Joe's loss on the faces of her children every day. Supported by Inquest and by a number of MPs, she has repeatedly called for a public inquiry into Joe's death (the coroner, John Ellery, lent his voice to this demand at the close of the inquest) - there has never been an inquiry into the death of a child in custody. Blunkett has ignored her. \"The Home Office should hang their heads in shame,\" she says. \"Three children have died in prison since Joe died. I'm at a loss to understand why people in this country aren't bothered. If it happens to children in our own country, we close our eyes and ears to it. I feel disappointed in our fellow man.\" </p> <p>At the opening of the inquest, during the lunch break, Deborah Coles introduced me to Dr Barry Goldson, an academic at Liverpool University. On learning I was preparing an article on Joe's death, Goldson went into formal academic mode. He quoted figures from different European countries that showed Britain was at the top end of the scale when it came to the numbers of children it locked up. He quoted studies on youth offending, rehabilitation and sentencing policy, and offered to send me articles he had written himself. It was all very precise, very scholarly. And then he paused, looked me in the eye and said, \"But you have to ask yourself: what the fuck was the judge thinking sending him to prison?\" </p> <p>That night - just a few hours after the inquest's first day closed - a 15-year-old boy called Gareth Paul Myatt died at Rainsbrook training centre, run by Group 4. He arrived the previous Friday and had survived all of two days in prison.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ronan Bennett is author of Havoc in its Third Year (Bloomsbury)</p>",
  "Ask Enfield residents whether the Labour government has made them feel safer on the streets, and it's not the threat of international terrorism that worries so much as the corrosive spots that blight their daily lives - the youths hanging around, the abandoned vehicles that attract crime, the graffiti and the dog dirt. <p>Labour has made several legislative changes designed to enable local authorities and the police to improve daily life. The Conservative-led council in Enfield has, moreover, made the quality of life on the streets a priority and concentrated money and resources on it. The result is a new optimism among the professionals in the borough that improvements are slowly being delivered. Out on the streets, though, the public is not satisfied that the changes have come fast enough. </p> <p>\"If you see something horrible in your area as a member of the public, you don't want to have to navigate the planning department, the environmental health department and the cleansing department to get something done. You want to ring up the council and know it will be fixed,\" explains Mike Hainge, assistant director in the council's environmental health department. </p> <p>A new \"envirocrime\" unit, set up with money from the council budget but with extra funds coming from the police through central government initiatives, has helped provide some \"joined-up thinking\". </p> <p>For example, most low-level crime and antisocial behaviour takes place at night, but in the past if residents rang the police to complain they would often be told that a particular problem fell under the council's remit, and that the council was available only in office hours. Now, the envirocrime unit functions at night. It also works closely with local police officers who know who can get things moving. </p> <p>In addition, trading standards officers have worked hard to tackle the sale of alcohol to children. A blitz of undercover test purchases in off-licences led to several prosecutions, and the stores appear to have a more cautious approach to selling. Since the undercover work, the ambulance service in the Upper Edmonton area has reported a 50% drop in the number of call-outs to alcohol-related accidents. </p> <p>The fire brigade has also seen dramatic savings. It has spent \u00a31m less on putting out car fires in the last year as the number of vehicles abandoned on the streets has fallen. A combination of legislative changes to allow faster removal of such cars, and money from both central and local government to pay the cost of taking them away, has produced results. </p> <p>The borough has seen the number of dumped cars fall by a fifth in the last two years. Neighbouring Haringey has, however, seen a 29% increase. \"There may be some displacement of crime going on, but we have brought prosecutions, so people now know we are not a good place to dump their cars,\" Mr Hainge says. </p> <p>On the Lytchett Way estate, community wardens who started work less than a year ago have brought a sense of security to a most troubled neighbourhood. But one of the wardens, a former UN peacekeeper called Tonka al-Hassan, has already resigned. Government funding from the neighbourhood renewal programme was available for only two years. It took 18 months to recruit and train the wardens, and so six months after they started work the cash ran out. </p> <p>The project has continued with some money from the council and an extension from the Home Office, but now residents must decide whether they are prepared to pay for the service themselves. Each would have to pay about \u00a32.30 a week. Mr Hassan was popular and loved the job, but could not continue working under such uncertainty and has taken a job elsewhere. Work to make the leap from a successful pilot project to a long-term, financially viable operation has proved tough. </p> <p>Enfield has made use of the new legislation bringing in anti-social behaviour orders (Asbo). Six have been served on people who were a persistent nuisance. In addition, 43 of the less draconian acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs) have been issued to people causing misery to neighbours. Only one has been breached. \"They have been most successful with youths who treated the magistrate system with contempt because they knew the threat of prison for minor offences would never be delivered. But an Asbo is a court order and a matter of record; if you breach it you can go to prison. The newspapers print your picture, the community knows you can [go to prison] too, so it gives them confidence,\" Mr Hainge says. </p> <p>Although most people on the streets agree the borough is cleaner than before, with litter, dumped cars and vandalism dealt with faster, it is the blight that they still notice. </p> <p>A mother with young twins playing in the small new playground behind the Edmonton shopping centre, where the grim old high-rises have been refurbished or replaced with smart low-rise housing, is angry and depressed that the new climbing frames have already been sprayed with graffiti. </p> <p>Leford Thompson, employed by the housing management to clean up the streets, cannot believe how little people care about their environment. \"You just finish your work and they start littering it all over again. It's very discouraging.\" </p> <p>Leon Pali, a stall owner in a shopping centre which is to have its front replaced, believes things are getting worse. \"Safety is still a big problem here,\" he says. </p> <p>When pressed, he admits the part of the borough where he lives is much better. \"It's been cleaned up and feels safer.\" So are things getting better overall? \"They should do more.\" </p> <p><b>The Guardian's unique Enfield project</b></p> <p>Labour will be judged at the next general election in large part on whether it has succeeded in improving public services. In an attempt to build up a definitive picture in one local area, the Guardian is putting Enfield under a journalistic microscope. A team of specialist reporters returns to the London borough regularly to investigate performance in such areas as health, education and crime. Every month until the election we will publish their findings, providing a rare insight into the crucial challenge facing Tony Blair: is Labour delivering?</p>",
  "Ken Bigley said he only wanted to live \"a simple life\" moments before he was murdered by the Islamist militants who held him captive for three weeks, it emerged yesterday. <p>Although he clearly realised he did not have long to live, Mr Bigley appeared calm as he addressed the prime minister in a video posted on a website yesterday: \"Here I am again, Mr Blair... very, very close to the end of my life.</p> <p>\"You don't appear to have done anything to help me,\" the 62-year-old engineer continued. \"I'm not a difficult person. I am a simple man who just wants to live a simple life with his family.\" At the end of Mr Bigley's plea, he is beheaded by his masked captors.</p> <p>There were no clues in the video about whether Mr Bigley did manage to briefly escape his captors shortly before his death. At the weekend, claims surfaced that Mr Bigley had spent up to 12 hours at liberty.</p> <p>However, on the video showing Mr Bigley's murder, one of the captors accused the British government of lying when it said it had no means of communication with the group. \"They lied. There was a very clear contact,\" he said.</p> <p>The worst fears of the Bigley family were confirmed on Friday when the video showing Mr Bigley's murder surfaced in Baghdad. It was not posted on a website used by Islamist extremists until yesterday.</p> <p>As in previous tapes, Mr Bigley is seen dressed in an orange jumpsuit, similar to those worn by prisoners in Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>He sits on the floor in front of six armed men wearing balaclavas. Five carry rifles and one, a tall broad-shouldered man standing in the centre, has a large knife tucked into his belt.</p> <p>Behind the group is a bare brick wall and the black and white flag of the Tawhid and Jihad group, the militants led by the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</p> <p>Mr Bigley says in the video that the patience of his captors \"is wearing thin, and they are very very serious people\".</p> <p>He says: \"Please, please give them what they require - freedom of their women from the Abu Ghraib prison. I beg you... British people, more than ever I need your help, more than ever I need your voices to go out in the street and to demand a better life for the females and the women who are imprisoned in the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad... All I can tell you now is that I have very short time left.\"</p> <p>One of the hooded men then says that leaders of \"infidel western governments\" pretend to care about their people but are \"liars and hypocrites\".</p> <p>He says the kidnappers extended the deadline for Mr Bigley's death to allow time for coalition authorities to meet their demand.</p> <p>Britain has repeatedly said it has no women prisoners under its control.</p> <p>He adds: \"Britain is not serious in releasing our sisters. There is nothing further for this wicked Briton than the sword.\"</p> <p>He then draws a knife from his belt, and three of the others grab Mr Bigley. He is shoved to the floor and his head severed and held up.</p> <p>The confusion over Mr Bigley's possible escape has continued. It appears he was being held in Latifiya, a mostly Sunni enclave south of Baghdad and a crucial supply route for insurgents holed up in the stronghold of Falluja.</p> <p>Several sources from the Sunni insurgency have suggested Mr Bigley escaped. One man claiming to know the kidnappers told the Associated Press that he was found by his kidnappers carrying a gun.</p> <p>The Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshiyar Zebari, said it was \"likely\" Mr Bigley had escaped, but he could not give details.</p> <p>The British Foreign Office refused to discuss a newspaper report that two of his captors were paid by British intelligence to help him escape and were driving him towards a US-controlled area when they were stopped by members of another Tawhid and Jihad cell and returned.</p> <p>Nor would it discuss the kidnappers' claims that the government knew how to contact them. On Friday the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, admitted that the government had exchanged messages with the captors, but refused to give details.</p> <p>Tony Blair spent about 15 minutes speaking to members of Mr Bigley's family in Liverpool on the phone on Saturday. Downing Street said there were no plans for Mr Blair to make a statement about the murder. But together with the conclusion of the Iraq Survey Group that Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction, it will lead to mounting pressure for a debate.</p> <p>In Iraq, Sabah Kadhim, a spokesman for the interior minister, said: \"The terrorists succeeded in exploiting the media for their benefit.\"</p> <p>\"We feared from the beginning that they would kill him. They want the world to focus on them and their savage acts.\"</p> <p>The Iraqi police continue to search for Mr Bigley's body. In similar cases in the past, bodies have been dumped at the roadside soon after killings.</p>",
  "During tomorrow's House of Lords debate on hunting, some noble participant will claim that abolitionists are less concerned with the welfare of foxes than with promotion of class war. The allegation is not original. Ninety-five years ago - when the Lords and the Commons clashed so violently that the peers' powers were limited by the Parliament Act - the same accusation, supplemented by a threat, was made by Winston Churchill. \"They have started a class war and they had better be careful,\" he said. His warning was directed towards the Lords, which had chosen to challenge the decision of the elected House of Commons. <p>In two significant ways, the constitutional dispute of 1909 was different from the little squabble which ought to end tomorrow. The legislation which their lordships tried to derail was the finance bill. Without it, the government could not have fulfilled its promise to introduce old-age pensions and increase the size of the fleet. The principle - \"who rules, peers or people?\" - applies, in exactly the same way. However, the Commons of 1909 defended its democratic rights with a passion that its modern counterparts have lacked. </p> <p>Edwardian MPs had only a limited right to claim that they represented the popular will. Women and working men were still denied the vote. But the spokesman for democracy rounded on their lordships with real ferocity. Churchill never liked the upper house, which he described as \"filled with old, doddering peers, cute financial magnates, clever wire-pullers and big brewers with bulbous noses\". He promised to \"rattle their coronets\". Lloyd George offered a more elegantly offensive description of the peerage: \"Five hundred ordinary men, chosen accidentally from the unemployed.\" They could not be allowed \"to override the deliberate judgment of millions of people\". </p> <p>The similarities of the two occasions confirm how little even the reformed upper house has changed. We can predict, with absolute certainty, that claims will be made about the way in which a ban on hunting with dogs will devastate the rural economy. It may even be that the Earl of Onslow makes noble flesh creep with the prediction that hundreds of farriers, kennel men, grooms and huntsmen will lose their jobs. The Lord Onslow of 1909 warned that, if Lloyd George's budget got through, penal taxation would force him to sack half the workers on his estate. </p> <p>However, the greatest similarity between then and now is the way in which peers who wish to frustrate the will of the Commons always invent special (but spurious) reasons why the usual conventions of parliament should be ignored in this \"particular case\". </p> <p>Tomorrow we shall be told that the opponents of blood sports are motivated by malice; that urban MPs certainly do not understand and probably hate the countryside; that only elective tyrannies deny minorities the right to kill small furry animals; and that, in any case, the bill is the work of backbench members not the government. </p> <p>On other occasions, the Commons will be applauded for its occasional demonstration of unwhipped independence. But not tomorrow. The subject will be said to have a unique significance. It has to be constitutionally special in order to justify the Lords' conduct. </p> <p>It was just the same in 1909. Lord Rosebery - by then, bitterly opposed by the party he once led - announced that the Lords were the true democrats. The people had not been consulted about Lloyd George's proposals. They had no more control over what he intended than \"if they were Lapps or Tatars\". If the Commons had its way, the upper house would \"simply exist as a debating chamber\". By defeating the government, peers would \"uphold the rule of law\". They would be rejecting \"not a budget but a revolution\". </p> <p>Lord Ridley made the same point in rather more flamboyant language. The Times reported his speech with evident approval: \"The Lords had hitherto acquiesced to decisions of the House of Commons because its business had been conducted by sane men. But there was now a House of Commons which was controlled by madmen, and they had to take a different view.\" Lloyd George's response was equally colourful. \"With your help,\" he told the public meeting in Limehouse, \"we can brush the Lords like chaff before us.\" </p> <p>Do not expect to hear anything like that tomorrow - either in the House of Lords or in the Commons when members of parliament discover that the bill, which they have approved so often, has once more been rejected in \"the other place\". But true democrats should feel that what the debate lacked in character it has made up in constitutional significance. The Lords, once more displaying their sclerotic nature, will do themselves more damage. \"Liberty,\" said Lloyd George 95 years ago, \"owes as much to the foolhardiness of its foes as to the sapience and wisdom of its friends.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Roy Hattersley's The Edwardians is published by Little Brown tomorrow </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

It has been virtually impossible to watch soaps or serials because I have never been in during the evenings, so I tend to watch one-off programmes. Although now, I'll be able to watch soaps, which I've not been able to for the past 40 years. When I go to America I enjoy watching the Weather Channel, which we don't have here any more. </p> <p> <strong> Radio: </strong> I mainly have it on as background noise and in the car. When driving around the country I listen to Radio 2 but if I'm in London I'll turn to Capital. Chris Tarrant's breakfast show was excellent, but I don't enjoy his successor. </p> <p> <strong> Ads: </strong> I watch ITV about once or twice a year, so I don't see many adverts. The only adverts I see are in the newspapers which I don't tend to remember. However I can't forget one in a newspaper last week for a musical instrument company which featured me - without my permission. </p> <p> <strong> New Media: </strong> I've been working on computers since 1962. I have several at home, because I do most of my work via the internet and email. I also enjoy buying computer parts on eBay. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Michael Fish presented weather forecasts on the BBC for 32 years until his retirement last week </p>",
  "<p>Children's television is a mega global business. Some of the multimillion-dollar numbers involved are enough to bring tears (of joy, that is) to the eyes of the most hardened City investor. So what are we to make of the news that ITV, Britain's premier commercial broadcaster, is considering selling its children's airtime to Nickelodeon? </p> <p>On the face of it, Britain's most commercial broadcaster has failed to grasp the major commercial opportunities offered by one of the most lucrative areas of the television business. In reality, there are three interrelated factors behind its thoughts of selling - the broken-backed ownership of ITV pre-merger with the attendant role of the Network Centre, the profoundly unhelpful approach of the old regulator (the ITC) and the nature of the children's business itself. </p> <p>To take the last first. Much children's TV is funded by merchandising and about 80% of the revenues are from off TV. In other words, ad revenue is nowhere near the most significant revenue stream associated with this type of programming. In effect, TV is the shop window for sales of branded goods - toys, pyjamas, paper plates, potties - you name it and I bet there's one with a Pok\u00e9mon on it. </p> <p>Broadcasters have responded to this in two main ways. Either they have used the value of their airtime - the shop window - to force down the price they pay producers for the programming or they have sought to play the whole game themselves by originating the programming and using their own airwaves as effectively as possible to create a market for the attendant merchandising. At one extreme, it is not unusual in the US for broadcasters to charge producers a fee and demand a share of their other revenues in exchange for broadcasting their children's programmes. At the other, there is the BBC, which has turned Teletubbies and Tweenies into global money-spinners. It has organised the use of its airwaves so its properties get the maximum and most effective exposure, especially at key times (such as the lead up to Christmas), making it the UK's most effective commercial kids player by far. </p> <p>ITV, meanwhile, is stuck in the terrestrial space alone with no dedicated children's channel, still paying over the odds for programmes that go on to make other people lots of money and unable to grasp the whole value chain in the the way the BBC has. To ITV, children's programmes are loss-makers - the advertising revenue barely covers the cost - and the requirement to do them at all is part of what it regards as overburdensome regulatory obligations. </p> <p>There are broadly two reasons for this - both historical and to some degree beyond ITV's control. First, the programmes ITV made were not owned by the network but by the then individual companies, such as Granada or Carlton. The network could be judged only in terms of ad revenue - it had no share in the ultimate value of the property beyond its immediate value to the ITV schedule. </p> <p>Second, there is the role played by the then regulator - the ITC. The idea, which still underpins so much regulation, that commercial activity must always be separate from editorial content, was played out in the children's arena in the most ostrich-like fashion. Programmes were not allowed, for instance, if merchandise related to the characters was already in the shops. But these rules didn't apply to foreign acquisitions or the BBC. This amounted to a wilful failure to understand the dynamics of the marketplace and hobbled ITV. </p> <p>In fairness, not all ITV's required kids' programmes can be regarded as big potential moneyspinners. General entertainment and factual shows featuring real kids (as opposed to merchandisable characters) may have extra value as formats internationally, but are not in the Power Rangers, Sponge Bob or Teletubbies league. Nevertheless the fact is that ITV has been unable to turn its children's block into the valuable asset it could have been, which might have sustained and nurtured ITV's considerable contribution to public service children's programming for the future. </p> <p>But back to reality. ITV still sees its children's block through ad sales' eyes as a liability and has failed to establish a presence in the multichannel marketplace so beloved of many young viewers and as such is some way behind the pack. So maybe that's it - game over, bring on Nick or Disney? Shame though.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Steve.hewlett1@btinternet.com\">Steve.hewlett1@btinternet.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Billboards have always been the largest advertising media in terms of literal size. They're now big business too. Most people will have driven past the UK's largest poster site, which covers one side of the Fort Dunlop factory by the M6 outside Birmingham, without realising it earns an annual revenue of \u00a33m. But before you decide to offer up the exterior of your home as a billboard - perhaps with little holes in it for the windows - bear in mind that high income requires high traffic. </p> <p>A gable-end on a quiet side-street would be worth an annual rent of only \u00a3500. Whereas a modest site on London's Oxford Street can pull in \u00a37,000 a year, a 40-ft illuminated panel on the route to Heathrow can net \u00a350,000 a month. </p> <p>The poster business has been through a quiet revolution. Viacom, ClearChannel and JCDecaux have bought out most of the 150 plus companies who used to run what was until recently a virtual cottage industry, and they now control 75% of British sites. </p> <p>Revenues have risen 23% since 1998, creating a market worth over \u00a3800m, with the industry's slice of the advertising cake rising from 7% five years ago to an estimated 10% this year. </p> <p>The new-found success is partly due to the enormous investment by new owners - they've spent millions on turning bus stops into bus shelters (which carry ads), on illuminated posters, on \"talking\" and scent-emitting posters, even computers that report whether a scrolling \"Tri-Vision\" has got stuck. </p> <p>Plus they've created, at great expense, an audience measurement company called Postar, which has studied the travel habits of 7,500 people, tracking 80,000 of their journeys, to deter mine not just how often they pass posters, but how often they look at them and for how long. </p> <p>Postar has surveyed over 100,000 British poster sites and analysed the traffic flowing past them on an hour-by-hour basis, even recording socio-demographic information on the people who pass by. Its data is so detailed, it even tracks how much daylight a poster receives depending on whether it's in London, Liverpool or Glasgow. </p> <p>So despite the seismic changes taking place in the media landscape, the future for posters looks rather promising. For one thing, we're all spending more time out of the home - \"often stuck in traffic jams\", says a spokesman for the Outdoor Advertising Association. Frustrating if you're in a car, but good if you own billboards. And as Stevie Spring, the chief executive of ClearChannel UK, puts it, \"You can't TiVo a poster.\" </p> <p>Arguably, the internet may be one threat on the horizon. (It has overtaken cinema as a medium, and is now closing-in on radio). But internet advertising has a long way to go to match the creative opportunity posters offer. Would Eva Herzigova's breasts in a bra have had the same impact online as they did on the high street? </p> <p>As media consumption fragments, so poster briefs are becoming more highly sought after by creatives - they're the biggest shop window their egos, and that includes mine, have left. </p> <p>Creatives have always liked posters, perhaps because of their brutal simplicity (Charles Saatchi was a noted exponent). The best ones were often for brands not allowed to advertise on TV, such as cigarettes (Silk Cut) and political parties (\"Labour Isn't Working\"). </p> <p>Lately it's cars, like Land Rover's \"Hippos\" and \"Maasai Warriors\" executions, Volkswagen's \"Elepump\" (last year's Campaign Poster Awards Gold winner) and maybe even my own effort - a poster showing US cops huddled behind a \"small but tough\" Volkswagen Polo, which is nominated at this year's awards which take place on Wednesday night. But it's a hard job when you're granted only one second of eye contact with the punter. It's like having to make up a joke when all you can use is the punchline. </p> <p>\"You have to come up with a simple idea, and then simplify it,\" says Dave Dye, creative director of Campbell Doyle Dye, speaking at a conference on the art of the poster. Dye cited the Ben &amp; Jerry's billboards (by Fallon) as a success. His least favourite poster? \"By their very nature they are dull and un-rememberable. So I can't think of any.\" </p> <p>Jeremy Carr, creative partner at Miles Calcraft Briginshaw Duffy, told the same conference that he admires the British Heart Foundation poster \"Artery\", by Euro RSCG London, for its \"disgustingly compelling visual\" which \"stuck out like a nicotine-stained thumb\". In fact, it was a poster for Araldite that made him want to get into advertising. \"A Cortina was stuck to a poster, which read: 'Also sticks handles to teapots'. The brand's still glued in my head.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Simon Veksner is a copywriter at ad agency DDB London.

  "<p>The now legendary story of Cadbury's sponsoring Anthea Turner's wedding a few years ago was what a PR analyst might call a landmark case. The self-righteous and principled among us shake their heads at the sheer tastelessness of it, while secretly cursing the fact that it wasn't our idea. In truth it was a simple case of cheeky product placement. Cadbury's Snowflake brand did well for a few days, although Anthea's career took a nosedive. Signficantly it set the tone for a trend in staged paparazzi shots brokered by photographic agencies. </p> <p>A few years ago there was a breed of snapper that used to be happy elbowing their way into society events and then employing a brassy form of charm to win over the host. Most were chucked out amid a scuffle of curses and oaths but one or two - notably Richard Young and Dave Bennett - lasted the course and have gone on to become the eminences grises of the business. It can be no coincidence that two of the star players - Dave Hogan and Bennett - have sold up to Getty Pictures, although Young remains independent. </p> <p>Celebrity photographers are dug in at the front line of the media war zone. Some seek anonymity, others dress like an SAS strike squad. All carry an increasingly sophisticated array of high-tech kit and converse in a bizarre military slang in their self-appointed roles as the dogs of war. </p> <p>The two names that dominate the tabloid market here are Big Pictures and Jason Fraser. Last Tuesday's Sun front page led with a Fraser series of pictures of the model Sophie Anderton apparently relaxing with her new boyfriend in Monaco. The week before, Denise Van Outen was photographed in New York and these pictures were sold to three different UK glossy magazines, again by Fraser's company. Fraser is a former Fleet Street picture editor with a colourful past and a persuasive nature. Most of his shots are set up and, by my calculations, it's possible for an agency such as his to make over \u00a32m in revenue during a good year. </p> <p>Big is run by an entrepreneurial Australian called Darryn Lyons who has nailed a huge lion skin to the floor of his London office in a gesture that says: \"Don't Fuck With Me\". His businesses include clubs in Australia, a yacht company based in the Far East and the South of France, and an international property company. His core business is the distribution of celebrity photographic images. </p> <p>Lyons and Fraser are big game hunters with a hotline to the senior editors of UK media titles. Their symbiotic relationship with the PR business can be demonstrated through branded photography in the tabloids or through the unofficial pap shots that have an air of having been approved by someone in a position of authority. </p> <p>This is a critical point as many magazines and picture desks are wary of the ability of celebrities to sue for invasion of privacy. A magazine like Heat - which celebrates its intimate relationship with celebrities on a weekly basis - has learnt to tread carefully as it pursues a readership with a keen desire for behind-the-scenes access. </p> <p>The uncomfortable relationship between stars and paps is built on many misconceptions. One of these is the belief that all paparazzi are wild animals. This is not so. Some are honourable, talented and generous people who take great photographs but this is not acknowledged by a star like Jude Law, who stalks past the paparazzi at film premieres in the mistaken belief that he's making a stand against the devil. </p> <p>It is the European paparazzi on their high powered bikes that are likely to cause most offence. In amongst this group are a hard core of Travis Bickle-style lunatics who are quite happy to trespass, bribe, stalk, bully, molest, insult and blackmail their prey to get a result. It is this activity that has started to register with celebrity PR and legal representatives from London and LA. As a result the activities of the paparazzi and agencies could be challenged through a potential change in the law. The publication of photographs of people going about their private business is under scrutiny and new rules of engagement seem imminent. </p> <p>Ultimately the tradition of great news photography will not be affected by a new privacy law. How the cult of celebrity, with its myriad parasitic industries, adapts to deal with the increasing threat of new legislation, remains to be seen.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Julian Henry runs Henry's House, a PR consultancy for brands and celebrities</p>",
  "<p>There's generally tension when a member of a family announces an interest in amateur genealogy. During the period of research, the other relatives are suspended between the likelihood of tedium but the possibility of secrets being revealed. </p> <p>You may initially feel the same ambivalence about Who Do You Think You Are?, in which eight showbiz aristocrats investigate their ancestors. If discovering the middle names and death dates of our own aunts and uncles can be dull, then how much interest can we develop in Jeremy Clarkson's or Amanda Redman's? The batting order also seemed to me problematic: didn't it make sense to begin with one of the friendlier screen presences - Ian Hislop or Meera Syal, say - rather than the prickly Bill Oddie? </p> <p>You soon realise, though, that the producers have chosen the order owing to narrative rather than character. A tree is too gentle an image for the family connections Oddie uncovers: he stumbles on deeply buried tendrils that can't be pulled up without pain. </p> <p>\"I never thought I had much of a family,\" Oddie confesses as his search begins. With the ear of the comedian he was before he turned to a second TV career in birds, he chuckles and corrects himself: he isn't complaining about the quality of his relatives but the quantity. In fact, his gripe has both meanings. He remembers being \"sort of abandoned\" by a mother of whom he has only four memories. These feel to him like a trailer for a film he's never seen. </p> <p>Oddie had a breakdown about four years ago. Although he doesn't say so, the on-screen graphic of his family tree reveals that this happened at the age his father died. Therapy encouraged him to reconstruct his past and add to the quartet of stories about his mother. </p> <p>It's clear that the model for this series is detective fiction, but what Oddie discovers makes this more than a structural metaphor. The protocol of writing before transmission demands vagueness but the ambushes from Oddie's background include insanity and two suspicious deaths: one domestic, the other industrial. The eventual significance of an old Lancashire mill practice called \"kissing the shuttle\" feels, in particular, very Ruth Rendell. </p> <p>Then, as Oddie meets old schoolfriends and reads death certificates and coroners' reports, the feel of the documentary moves from crime story to one of those amnesia thrillers in which the hero suddenly understands the meanings of fragments. The boy who lived next door remembers from six decades back the arrival of a black van: \"I remember your dad having trouble getting your mum to go.\" </p> <p>Not since a Comic Roots documentary in which Michael Palin talked of his father's stutter and his sister's depression has a film revealed such unexpected complexities in a television figure: we are even offered a Freudian explanation for Oddie's interest in ornithology. </p> <p>Unusually for a portmanteau show, the opening titles feature all eight presenters - as if to plead, like a lonely spinster aunt, for us to stay around even if we're bored - but this opener alone makes you want to see more of this clever and original idea which has the feel of a version of Great Railway Journeys in which the geography is personal. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tuesday, 9pm, BBC2 </p> <p><strong>Sex in the city</strong></p> <p>In a moment as bleak as TV drama has ever felt, a middle-aged man explains why he's ending his relationship with a young woman: \"You get looser, you get diseases. You cost me $1200 and I'll be lucky to get $800 now.\" The speaker is a pimp, telling a Moldovan teenager, who he abducted and sold into sexual slavery, why he is selling her on to a London flesh-factory. </p> <p>The scene is from Sex Traffic, Channel 4's two-part drama about the international racket in selling young European women for prostitution. As acknowledged by the title, this series has an obvious connection, in subject-matter and structure, with one of Channel 4's biggest drama hits of the past: the drug drama Traffik. But, in that case, the audience had an ambiguous relationship with the material: demographics suggest that many of Traffik's viewers would have been drug-users who were perhaps not too bothered about how the products got here. </p> <p>But, as even the most priapic free-marketeers would balk at supporting the sale of European women into prostitution, Sex Traffic faces the risk of guaranteed indignation from an audience that instinctively supports the investigators rather than the scumbags running the trade. </p> <p>Abi Morgan's script addresses this by adding layers of moral complication through sub-plots that touch on western exploitation of Europe: including possible corruption in an American defence contractor and the international peace-keeping force. </p> <p>The other technical challenge for Sex Traffic is how to make a film about the sexual exploitation of women without repeating the evil you claim to be preaching against. Recent French cinema (Romance, Irreversible) has often failed in this respect but director David Yates avoids pornography by extending the fast-cutting, eye-distracting visual style he used in State of Play. In that drama, the method prevented viewers getting on to the plot; here, it guards against anyone getting off on the sexual depravity depicted. </p> <p>Television programmes with \"sex\" in the title are generally opportunistic - no other word so reliably raises ratings - but viewers seeking sleaze here will soon leave. This is a bleak, responsible but also gripping thriller which - like Stephen Frears' Dirty Pretty Things - shows that most of us know almost nothing about the underworld of London.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sex Traffic, Thursday, 9pm, Channel 4</p>",
  "<p>In April, six Rolls-Royce workers were sacked for what the company claimed was misuse of the internet. There was nothing illegal about the content of the material they downloaded, and the police weren't notified, but it was P45s all round, nevertheless. </p> <p>It's just one of the stories that is making trades union increasingly concerned about the number of staff being fired or disciplined by bosses who snoop through their email accounts and web archives. Bosses, on the other hand, argue that they are justified because they need an objective way of monitoring staff performance. Millions of pounds are lost each year, especially by small businesses, because slack employees are wasting too many working hours in cyberspace. </p> <p>Unions, however, fear that technology is beginning to outstrip the law and that individual privacy is under threat as bosses swap scruples for the latest in \"spy software\". But bosses, perennially under pressure from shareholders to boost profitability, claim that such software is a great business tool and as long as it's there, they'll use it. </p> <p>A growing number of UK companies are monitoring staff electronically. The birth of call-centre Britain with its rows of cubicles has made it more difficult for managers to check up on employees. They used be able to deal effectively with people chatting around the coffee machine but now they are more concerned about what they get up to when they are - supposedly - working at their desks. \"It's beginning to dawn on employers, that personal emails and internet usage are a large invisible use of time,\" says Colin Barrow of the Cranfield School of Management. </p> <p>Aware of how much of the day can be squandered online, many multinationals have signed up for backroom software packages to monitor internet use in detail. From the moment a worker logs on in the morning to the moment they shut down at night, IT departments can watch his each and every action - websites visited, emails received and sent, even the keys pressed. Drug testing, toilet-break timing, and CCTV surveillance have also been introduced by companies anxious to ensure that staff are not dragging their heels. </p> <p>Statistics show that employers have good grounds to be watchful. Almost 15% of office emails are to recruitment agencies from staff using their employer's time to scout for other jobs. Over 70% of internet shopping purchases, including sign-ups for pay-to-enter porn sites, are made between nine and five during the working week. At its peak, it was estimated that the weekly cost to employers in the UK of workers accessing Channel 4's Big Brother website was \u00a31.4 m. </p> <p>According to Barrow, Britain's fabled long-hours culture is partly responsible for the upturn in cyberslacking. Employers, particularly in small businesses, are stepping up their demands on staff but offering little in return. Using the internet and sending personal emails are ways in which staff can seek compensation for 'lost' hours. \"If you 'steal' people's time, you can't be too surprised, if they steal it back,\" he says. People make trade-offs too. \"I hear people saying 'I had to phone America from home, so why shouldn't I book my holiday on the internet at work' or 'They didn't reimburse me for texting that I was held up in a traffic jam on the way to the office'.\" </p> <p>As a riposte to the TUC and human rights organisations' indignation at Britain's booming 'snooping culture', bosses claim that they have legitimate reasons for upping surveillance levels at work. In the post-Enron era, they say, they need to address security risks and, for insurance purposes, assess cases of harassment. Emails need to be scanned for viruses, spam, and to monitor customer service. There are jolting pecuniary repercussions for employers in the form of lawsuits or egregious PR for any chinks in the armour. </p> <p>But the increasing use of what Liberty has dubbed 'Stasi-like' surveillance methods has sparked anxieties about privacy, and, as recent research by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development shows, deleterious effects on employee stress levels, morale and productivity. </p> <p>Monitoring staff may also be against the law. The UK's privacy watchdog the Information Commissioner has produced stringent codes of practice governing how closely companies can scrutinise private communications. Companies that breach them risk prosecution under the Data Protection Act. \"Staff do have rights against Big Brother bosses and they must be told if, how and why their email, phone calls, internet use and other behaviour is being monitored,\" says Brendan Barber at the TUC. </p> <p>Barrow suspects that in many cases monitoring gizmos are being used to conceal bad management practices. \"Electronic surveillance should be a final fallback,\" he says. \"The problem is that bosses grab at it as a substitute for a policy.\" </p> <p>Barry Hugill, of human rights lobby Liberty, agrees that employers' trust in surveillance technology is misplaced. \"Any sensible employer will not want to spend a great deal of time monitoring how their employees are using their computers and phones, because a much more effective way of checking someone's capability at work is the output,\" he says. \"Sensible management will make it absolutely clear what the rules are. Of course, it's OK to use your phone to ring your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife, to book film or theatre tickets. But if you spend your entire afternoon on the internet, that will reflect on the quality of your work.\" </p> <p>Should the Rolls-Royce staff have been sacked? The burden of responsibility lies with employers to justify their monitoring activities, says Barrow. In order to avoid union accusations of intrusiveness and potential prosecution under data protection laws, clear guidelines need to be laid out. After all, it's no good recording every keystroke if it won't stand up in court.</p>",
  "<p>After seven years and 118 episodes of The Saint, I was looking for a new challenge. It was 1970. EMI had recently appointed Bryan Forbes as their head of production at Elstree Studios and we knew each other well from our time in the Combined Services Entertainment Unit. So I was intrigued when he called to ask if I'd heard of a book called The Case of Mr Pelham. He'd just given the green light to a script based on it, with producer Michael Relph and director Basil Dearden heading it up. They were two of Britain's most successful film-makers. Their script was called The Man Who Haunted Himself. </p> <p>It was one of the best scripts I'd ever read, with a very intriguing story: Harold Pelham momentarily \"dies\" on an operating table after a car accident, and his doppelg\u00e4nger is released into the world. He begins assuming Pelham's identity amongst friends, colleagues and even his family. Pelham (the real Pelham) is pushed towards insanity. It was a role that called for emotion, drama and great intensity; a role that needed an actor. I had that on my passport, so felt somewhat qualified. </p> <p>When asked about the film nowadays, I always reflect that it was one of the few times I was allowed to act. It's a terrible admission from someone who has made a living from walking in front of cameras. Though, in my defence, I'd previously been cast in roles that required a relatively straightforward approach, either as a romantic lead, heroic lead - or just holding a spear, as I did in my first movie. I'd never been dramatically stretched, as they say. </p> <p>Basil Dearden was a wonderful director. He gave me a great confi dence, as indeed he did the other actors. The great tragedy is that a short time after filming wrapped, he was driving home on the same stretch of the M4 where we'd filmed Pelham's accident, and his car careered out of control. He was killed. The film industry was robbed of a great talent that day. </p> <p>Armed with renewed confidence, I briefly returned to television to produce, (occasionally) direct and star alongside Tony Curtis in The Persuaders. It was a joyous year, spent at Pinewood and in the south of France - a dream job. Then I had a call from Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. Sean Connery had said \"never again\" to the role of James Bond, and would I talk to them about taking up the Walther PPK? Having completed The Persuaders, I was available and certainly interested. I obviously did something right, as they employed me for seven movies over 12 years. </p> <p>Any actor who says they wouldn't want to play Bond is lying. It is the role of a lifetime, and as well as financial security, it brought me the ability to choose other terrific roles in between outings. </p> <p>I look back with great affection on all my movies and television work. Among them all, many say my best role was in The Man Who Haunted Himself. Being a modest actor, I won't disagree.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A season of Roger Moore films starts at the Barbican, London EC2, on October 21. Details: 0845 1207550</p>"
