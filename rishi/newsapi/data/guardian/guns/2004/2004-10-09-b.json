  "<p>David Beckham seems to save his best for this arena, and by the end of a monumental anti-climax England were glad he still has the knack of stamping his personal class on less-than-convincing performances.</p> <p>The England captain's late goal was almost as uplifting as his famous free-kick against Greece, and if he has just avoided the onerous trip to Azerbaijan by picking up a booking, he can be forgiven after single-handedly rescuing the afternoon from workaday mediocrity.</p> <p>Considering Wales has just been omitted from the European Union's latest political map, this must have been the most over-hyped fixture since, well, since the last time England met any of their neighbours in a competitive game.</p> <p>That would have been the ludicrously pumped-up Battle of Britain of five years ago, when, in a demonstration of how far British football had fallen from the standards being set by the rest of Europe, Kevin Keegan's ageing and uninspired side limped past an abysmal Scotland to claim the right to be humiliated at Euro 2000.</p> <p>How times have changed. Scotland are now even more abysmal, and England are incomparably better, as Wales have just discovered, with two or three good young players for every position (except left wing, obviously) and a coach who is not afraid to let them show what they can do. Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson was variously described as bold, attacking and adventurous when the team sheets arrived to confirm England would play with three forwards, yet all he was actually doing was making sure he posed as many problems as possible for the reserves and lower league players in the Wales defence.</p> <p>Playing Wayne Rooney in the hole was also a recognition that the Manchester United player naturally operates deeper than conventional strikers, saved Eriksson from having to add to Michael Owen's frustration and allowed him to gloss over the left-wing problem. For all the neatness and enterprise of Eriksson's solution, there was a suspicion he might not have risked it against opponents any stronger than Wales, and might not have considered it at all had Wayne Bridge been fit.</p> <p>Wales did their best to counter Eriksson's cunning with a late reshuffle of their own when Andy Melville was injured in the warm-up, but pushing Mark Delaney into central defence and using Simon Davies as an emergency right-back only left the visitors looking even more patched up. Delaney was still congratulating himself on checking Owen's first run when the striker deflected Frank Lampard's shot past Paul Jones for an opening goal in under four minutes.</p> <p>'Are you Scotland in disguise?' the wags in the crowd demanded to know, showing a tad more wit than when spoiling the silence for Ken Bigley with anti-Welsh jibes a few minutes earlier. That was about as witty as it got. 'Stand up if you hate the Welsh' and 'No surrender to the IRA' do not count as higher forms of terrace originality, though the crowd needed to do something to stay awake.</p> <p>The combined effect of the early goal and the Welsh defensive switch was to take all the urgency out of the contest. Whereas everyone had been expecting a full-blooded, Premiership-style scrap, Wales were in damage limitation mode from the fourth minute onwards, sacrificing most of their attacking ambitions and concentrating on not getting too stretched at the back.</p> <p>The result was that England ended up with too much time. Too much time on the ball, too much time to think. Instead of darting into space and making the most of momentary openings, players such as Owen, Rooney and Jermain Defoe found themselves surrounded by their own colleagues.</p> <p>There was always an easy option to move the ball along sideways and England usually took it. It was not the ideal situation in which to judge the effectiveness of Eriksson's bold new formation. Even the supposed weaknesses on the wings were never put to the test after the Welsh reorganisation.</p> <p>Owen looked the liveliest of the three forwards, with Defoe not quite sharp enough to accept a couple of early chances and Rooney playing deeper than usual and gradually coming to the realisation that not even he can score with every touch.</p> <p>Swagger is all very well in an 18-year-old, but Rooney must play the team game too. There were times when Rooney went for glory when shooting was simply the wrong option, and there were signs too that the rest of the England team are starting to believe the teenager's publicity. David Beckham was guilty on a couple of occasions of ignoring better options in favour of unimaginatively giving the ball to Rooney. With Owen and Defoe hardly setting new standards for unselfish interpassing, England's attack had begun to look dysfunctional before Alan Smith replaced the latter.</p> <p>Although there were a couple of pleasing link-ups in the first half, England spent most of the game looking for someone to raise the tempo or make the afternoon memorable with a moment of undoubted class. </p> <p>Significantly, that person was not one of the three strikers but the much-maligned captain. Shaun Wright-Phillips would not have scored the goal Beckham supplied to secure victory. Yet by the same token, had Wales's best chance of the game fallen to a deadlier finisher than Craig Bellamy (that means anyone else on the pitch) the scores might have been levelled 10 minutes earlier. </p> <p>Had Mark Hughes been on the pitch, even in his suit, he would have buried the volley Bellamy fluffed and England would have been looking at another Austria scenario. That's Wales's problem. Their great players are never around at the same time. England might be thought to have the opposite problem, though on this evidence they still have more promising players than great ones.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>For the neutral there could be only one choice. Come on, you Wales! This is not merely to be a contrarian, more to try to inject some life into what promises to be a predictable qualifying competition. If Wales were to win or draw, everything would be up for grabs. If England were to win, they would be clear and coasting. 'The Road To Germany', as this series of matches has inevitably been dubbed, would be long and obvious. </p> <p>Austria at home with qualification already assured, anyone? Or how about Poland four days later with qualification even more assured, anyone? 'Two for the price of one... A fiver the pair...' Who'd be a tout? The BBC fielded an Englishman, a Scotsman and a Welshman in the studio and Gary Lineker, having noted this fact, sensibly refrained from following up with a joke. The Englishman, oddly, was Alan Shearer, who need not detain us. The Scotsman, inevitably, was Alan Hansen. And the Welshman, entertainingly, was Robbie Savage, who turned out to have made a financially astute move by having himself sent off against Northern Ireland, because surely the BBC pay their pundits more than the \u00a3300 fee plus \u00a3100 win bonus that was on offer for the Wales players performing on the pitch, rather than in the studio. </p> <p>In sum, the Englishman and the Scotsman thought England would win and the Welshman thought Wales would win. 'Things must be going well if Alan Hansen says England are playing well,' said Shearer, who then patted Hansen's right thigh in some form of masonic signal to denote he was telling a joke. Lapdog Savage duly laughed. Even in a bare half-hour of build-up, there was room for not one but two Garth Crooks interviews. </p> <p>'What will it be like to walk out of the Old Trafford tunnel in an England shirt?' asked Garth Crooks, ponderously and with an emphasis more suited to speaking to young children. </p> <p>'Just like any other game,' said Rio Ferdinand. </p> <p>'It must be your biggest game in a Welsh shirt,' asked Crooks. Although admittedly I paraphrase because I popped out to make a cup of coffee halfway through the question, returning from the kitchen easily in time to hear the reply. </p> <p>'I wouldn't say so,' said Ryan Giggs. </p> <p>Barristers strive not to ask questions to which they don't know the answer; fortunately for any putative clients and the speed of British justice, Crooks is no barrister. </p> <p>John Motson opened his commentary with the exciting news that 'I've got a new co-commentator'. It was Graeme Le Saux. And his first word was 'unbelievable'. He must lead a life full of surprises, because the news that a Wales central defender had injured himself in the warm-up didn't stretch one's credulity too much. </p> <p>Anxious to impress his new co-commentator, Motty, probably mistakenly, decided to see the match as a school reunion. </p> <p>'Three keen goal collectors in the front row of the England class,' he said. 'Nicky Butt is back in the form room.' On he stormed with his analogy: 'Ryan Giggs had to check he went into the right classroom.' It could have been a trailer for Grange Hill. </p> <p>'We seem to have been waiting for this match for an awful long time,' said Motty after a five-out-of-10 silence for Kenneth Bigley. And, within four minutes of the start: 'Sven's on his feet.' </p> <p>After which the game drifted into a lull from which it took more than an hour to escape. 'There we were thinking it was all going to be muck and bullets, but it hasn't quite turned out like that.' Muck and bullets? Motty was finding his stride. Minutes later Wales were 'smothering the ball away' and 'there was an unorthodox save by a fallen goalkeeper'. He is always at his best when he throws away the prepared script. </p> <p>In the tunnel at half-time Crooks buttonholed Bryan Robson. 'Hartson, Bellamy, Speed,' he said and if he had gone on through the entire team we would have rejoined the match in the 80th minute. </p> <p>The second half had its moments, notably when, in another trailer for Grange Hill , 'the Welsh defence completely lost their geography'. A Mottyism that should henceforth replace the rather tired 'lost the plot'. As in: 'I'm not sure what came over me. I completely lost my geography.' Then Beckham, who as Le Saux correctly pointed out hadn't been playing very well, played very well indeed for a second. 'Oh, what a joy to see Beckham produce a moment like that. It's like Greece all over again.' </p> <p>Not quite. Then England secured their World Cup place in the final minutes. This time they have practically done so with more than a year to go.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago English football was a different game. Fans could pay at the gate, grounds were often only two-thirds full, average attendance was 26,000 and not every Premiership stadium was all-seat. Sky Sports showed 40 live matches per season, and only on Sunday afternoons and Monday nights.</p> <p>Fast-forward a decade. You must buy your ticket in advance, the average crowd is over 35,000, and across the season's 380 Premier League games, grounds are 95 per cent full. This season Sky will screen 138 fixtures live and there are three different kick-off times on Saturdays alone. The top players earn \u00a380,000 to \u00a3100,000 a week: that would have been several months wages to most Premier League footballers in 1994.</p> <p>There have been similarly radical changes in the communications industry. Britain's 60 million citizens own 56.2m mobile phones; in 1994 it was just a few million. A decade ago few Britons had even heard of text messages; last year we sent 20.5 billion of them. Sky had 3.6m subscribers, fewer than half the number in 2004. And back then the world somehow coped without the as-yet-uninvented joys of photo-messaging, video-phones and Freeview set-top boxes.</p> <p>It is in this context of dramatic change in football, lifestyle and technology that Malcolm Glazer's bid to buy Manchester United makes sense, especially given the similarly dizzying upheaval still to come in those areas. When the takeover approach was confirmed last week, most business analysts were sceptical. How, they asked, could the 76-year-old American hope to make a serious profit on an investment of about \u00a3800m? Nobody seemed to know.</p> <p>The answer lies in what football and telecommunications might be like in 2014. If the changes over the next 10 years are as significant as they have been since 1994, Glazer's move might make him a fortune. The booming popularity of broadband internet - which lets fans watch TV-quality pictures on a personal computer, and allows every club to act as its own TV station - is the key. </p> <p>Privately, many United insiders are sceptical about Glazer's chances of making even bigger profits. 'How do you sweat what is probably football's dampest asset?' asked one. 'How would you do that except in the ways United are already doing it?' Understandably, the sceptics point to United's status as the world's most profitable football club. Their annual profits may have dropped from \u00a339.35m to \u00a327.91m last year because of their relatively poor performance in both the Premiership and Champions League, but that \u00a327.91m is still far more than any English or top European club made.</p> <p>It is no coincidence, however, that both Glazer and the Cubic Expression duo of John Magnier and JP McManus - the Irish investors who own 29 per cent of United, and whose stake Glazer wants to buy, to add to his own 19 per cent holding - see Old Trafford as a superb commercial asset that, in City parlance, is significantly under-exploited. Inevitably, perhaps, for characters who are businessmen first and lovers of sport second, the trio believe that United are in effect a slot-machine that in different hands could and should deliver bigger jackpots.</p> <p>'Malcolm Glazer and his sons want to own United for a number of reasons,' explains one source close to the American's plans. 'They are genuinely interested in sport; they think they could bring stability to the club; they have very smart marketing skills; they want to make the team even stronger and more successful football-wise, to make it unrivalled; and, yes, they want to make it more successful off the pitch too.'</p> <p>That last reason is the most important. There are plenty of ways in which United under the Glazer family's control could quickly start making even more money. Jacking up ticket prices, while unpopular, would scarcely affect United's drawing power: they were the only Premier League club to record 25 sell-outs from 25 home games last season. More of Old Trafford's 67,900 seats could be sold to corporate visitors willing to pay \u00a3100 or more a time, or many of the extra 7,700 new places that will be installed as part of Old Trafford's planned expansion could become 'executive' seats.</p> <p>Selling the stadium naming rights, as Arsenal have just done for their new home, would be easily the biggest money-spinner of that sort in football history. If the airline is prepared to pay \u00a340m-\u00a360m over 15 years to have the Gunners' new home called The Emirates Stadium, how much would Nike or Coca-Cola stump up to have Old Trafford renamed? Gambling would also provide a lucrative new revenue stream. Some football finance analysts believe United could use their worldwide popularity and their manutd.com website to become, in effect, an online global bookie. Their existing arrangement to have Ladbrokes as their 'official gaming partner' has only skimmed the surface of the huge potential there. United's best opportunity to make huge profits, though, is to get control of their own broadcasting rights and then use the ongoing revolution in broadband internet access to fully exploit the club's global popularity by persuading fans to pay to watch Wayne Rooney, Ruud van Nistelrooy and the rest live on a United website.</p> <p>The resulting revenue could reach \u00a3100m a year or more, and would destroy the competitiveness of not just the Premier league but the Champions League too - unless, of course, other super-clubs were doing the same. For United, broadband offers the chance to create a massive worldwide network of fans who pay a monthly or annual subscription to watch action from Old Trafford on personal computers or computer-fed TV including, crucially, live Premiership games. And if they can pull off that trick, then Liverpool, Juventus, Real Madrid and other clubs will quickly follow. Initially TV cameras will provide the pictures seen by broadband, but ultimately broadband could replace television altogether. Technological advances will soon end the inferior quality of pictures seen on the internet compared with TV. </p> <p>'If Malcolm Glazer got control of United and put exclusive club content on broadband, he could charge people to watch goals, highlights, archive games, player interviews, training sessions and, if things changed in the future, live Premier League games. Any club with a decent following abroad could monetise those people that way,' explains Dan Markham of Octagon, the sports marketing group.</p> <p>Broadband is spreading fast; very fast. While only some 100m people worldwide will have access to it by the end of 2004, numbers are going up rapidly in Asia, North America and parts of Europe. Only 3.2m households in the UK have it now, but that is predicted to rise to 5m by next year. The stunning growth in recent years of what were once niche markets - multi-channel TV, text messaging, even mobile phones - shows the potential rewards for any sports club or league who can 'monetise' by broadband.</p> <p>'Being American, and given the fact that America already has 30m homes with broadband, Glazer could start a United subscription broadband service there first,' says Markham. 'You have a potential market of tens of millions there and United are already a powerful brand there.' They could then seek to repeat the trick in China, Japan and beyond. Kevin Roberts, editorial direc tor of Sport Business , says: 'United are one of the few clubs that have the global fan base you need to make this a serious business proposition. Once broadband really takes off, United could cash in on their status as the only truly established international superbrand in English football and eventually make maybe \u00a32m or \u00a33m per match, adding perhaps as much as \u00a370m a season to their income.' </p> <p>What will happen if Europe's superclubs succeed in this? The trouble, as Markham and Roberts point out, is that their domestic leagues will become even more uncompetitive. And the on-off idea of creating a European Super League, if not a global league, could finally be realised. If all this sounds fanciful, consider that in America, one million baseball fans now pay $2.95 a day, $14.95 a month or $80 a season to watch up to 15 Major League Baseball matches live every day on a broadband website. Last year it was 500,000. During Euro 2004, fans wanting to see 10-minute highlight packages of games from Portugal soon after the final whistle paid \u20ac14.99 to do just that on the euro2004.com action broadband service. The site had more than two million visits during the tournament, but Uefa will not reveal how many people subscribed.</p> <p>In England, most of the 20 Premier League clubs operate a subscription-based broadband internet service where fans can, for a small fee, watch highlights, interviews and behind-the-scenes material. Between them they have about 100,000 subscribers worldwide. Since 2003 Sky Sports have been offering subscribers in the UK and Ireland highlights of events such as the Champions League, Ryder Cup and Premier League via broadband.</p> <p>'I can't tell you how many subscribers we have except that it's growing rapidly, but off a low base,' says Steve Nuttall, head of enterprises at Sky Sports.</p> <p>In all these ventures, what industry experts call 'displaced fans' - a Liverpool supporter living in Thailand, a New York Yankees follower on a trip to Seattle, an English cricket enthusiast on work placement in Australia - are the main target. While home-based fans can usually see what they want through domestic television, those outside the country often cannot. But thanks to the rapid globalisation of football, there are more and more 'displaced fans'. A recent survey by sports sponsorship agency Sport + Markt calculated that Real Madrid had 490m fans or potential fans around the world, with United second on 350m. Turning those fans into subscribers to a dedicated club broadband service could generate vast wealth. </p> <p>Nobody pretends that webcasting - offering live sporting action or highlights via broadband internet - is yet a serious money-spinner. But then, who in 1994 would have predicted games kicking off at lunchtime, 3pm and teatime on Saturdays? And who in 1991-92 really believed that the then Big Five clubs would dare to break away and form their own league, the Premier League? </p> <p>The problem for United in seeking to go down this road, whoever owns the club, is that the Premier League control their, and the other 19 clubs', broadcasting rights. In Italy and Spain, clubs sell their rights individually; here the league does it collectively. 'The only rights which United control are those to friendlies, testimonials, tours, Uefa Cup games and matches they play in the final qualifying round of the Champions League. The value of those is nothing compared to being able to show live Premiership games, which is where they could make really serious money,' stresses Roberts.</p> <p>While the 20 clubs have taken back more and more rights to exploit themselves with each new Sky contract, they can still show only highlights or full-match delayed reruns, not live games. When the Premier League chairmen sit down in 2006 to discuss the shape of the deal that will start in August 2007, Roman Abramovich's Chelsea, Liverpool - with a significant fan base in Asia - and Arsenal could all join United in seeking that concession, if not more.</p> <p>United have long been frus trated at earning far less from the Premier League's collective TV deals at home and abroad than they arguably deserve, given the large number of viewers they deliver. Last season, for instance, the League distributed to its 20 clubs \u00a3457.7m from the domestic broadcasting contract with Sky, of which United got \u00a331.3m, or 6.8 per cent. It was the same with the share-out of the \u00a365m from foreign television companies. United, despite being English football's undisputed big attraction, got the same \u00a32.83m as the other 19 clubs. Yet they provide, by common agreement, at least 25 per cent of all fans who tune in.</p> <p>This is why their former chairman, Sir Roland Smith, once suggested that the Premier League should let United sell their own TV rights and then pay a 'tax' on the resulting income as compensation to the other 19. Nothing changed. And when the new three-year broadcasting contracts were being discussed by the clubs early last year, Peter Kenyon, then still United's chief executive, again tried to get United more money. He requested the introduction of a 'weighting system' for the distribution of revenue generated from selling live Premier League games abroad, with payments linked to popularity. Unsurprisingly, the club chairmen rejected the proposal 19-1. If the Glazers get control of Old Trafford, United are unlikely to accept the rejection of such demands.</p> <p>The defining trends of European football in the past decade have been globalisation, commercialisation, broadcasting and elitism. Harnessing the worldwide popularity of football's lucky few clubs through broadband technology draws all those together perfectly.</p> <p>The Glazers know that, even if most others don't yet.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It was billed as a Premiership match between international teams. If so, it was more Manchester United at home to, say, Charlton rather than a contest between two top-quality equals. </p> <p>Although not as ruthless as they should have been, England easily saw off Wales and will go to Azerbaijan this week in good shape, with seven points from their three matches in qualifying Group 6 of the World Cup. They will, however, be without David Beckham, the captain having been shown a yellow card for a reckless tackle that earns him a suspension. Later he went to hospital where an X-ray showed a hairline fracture to a rib. </p> <p>Still, he knew that he would be forgiven for the lapse. A trademark goal, curled in expertly from some 30 yards made the last 15 minutes or so comfortable for England after they had missed several chances to add to Frank Lampard's early strike. Not that they ever looked uncomfortable. </p> <p>Poor Wales. Their hopes of qualification are slim after a limp performance in which they never looked likely to add to the two points they had gleaned. Now they must win Wednesday's match - Mark Hughes's last as their manager - against Poland at the Millennium Stadium. </p> <p>'I think England could now run away with the group and the hope is that they do, which will open it up for the rest of us to battle for the second place,' said Hughes. A play-off does look their best hope. </p> <p>The fates seemed to be against Wales from the outset. Their central defender Andy Melville pulled up with a calf injury in the warm-up and Hughes had to reorganise, Jason Koumas called into the midfield, Simon Davies moving to right back and Mark Delaney inside. </p> <p>This against an attacking selection by Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson. Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Jermain Defoe started in a three-pronged attack, Rooney the head of a midfield diamond, constantly unsettling Wales. His marker, Mark Pembridge, was withdrawn after an hour, to spare him further punishment. </p> <p>'They did very well,' said the England head coach. 'It is not only about putting on strikers and hoping they will score. You have to have a balance and we had that. We knew that Wales would want to defend deep, so they would not give space to Owen, Rooney and Defoe, and then make counter-attacks. I was happy that we were organised against that. </p> <p>'Michael played especially well,' Eriksson added, confirming also that the striker will 'probably' be captain in Baku. 'I haven't seen him that bright for a long time.' </p> <p>Hughes lamented: 'We hoped to be solid in the initial 20-minute period, but we had to reorganise and it proved too disruptive.' Indeed, Wales were a goal behind after four minutes, England profiting from a back four finding their feet. </p> <p>Nicky Butt, quietly efficient as England's holding midfield player, passed the ball forward to Owen and the striker held off Delaney to lay it off to Lampard. His drive from the edge of the penalty area entered the net via the foot of Owen, who claimed the goal, but the referee gave Lampard his sixth goal in nine internationals. </p> <p>It eased any expectancy England were subjected to by a raucous home crowd, many of whom jeered the Welsh anthem, some of whom disgracefully interrupted a silence for the murdered hostage Ken Bigley. Now England could pass the ball with patience, drawing Wales out from a shell that saw the deployment of a midfield five, an area in which the suspended Robbie Savage was missed. </p> <p>Space and opportunities materialised. Rooney danced past Pembridge and strode on to shoot from 25 yards, Paul Jones just turning the low shot aside via a post. Defoe swivelled to shoot wide, Jones saved Owen's shot with his legs. Wales, for whom Gary Speed hinted at attacking danger with a lob looped too high and a header straight at Paul Robinson, were grateful to get to half-time just a goal down. </p> <p>England emerged after the break reminded by Eriksson of the need for a second, soothing goal. Owen in particular looked hungry to score and came close when he cut in from the left and went past Delaney and Danny Gabbidon before Jones intervened. Rooney, too, also went close when, from another pass by Lampard, he beat Delaney, only to shoot at Jones from an acute angle with Owen and Defoe screaming for the ball to be cut back. </p> <p>Jones, who has recently lost his place in the Wolves team, was fast becoming a hero for Wales and excelled himself again by leaping to clutch Beckham's chip. And having survived England's flurry, Wales began to entertain thoughts of taking something from the game. </p> <p>Bellamy, largely disappointing, had switched from right to left in an attempt to escape the cloying attention of Ashley Cole, and with some joy. After a one-two with Ryan Giggs, the ball broke back to Bellamy off Koumas and he found himself in the clear, only to slice the volley wide. Bellamy even had the ball in the net, but the whistle had gone for John Hartson's high kick that caught Sol Campbell in the face. </p> <p>Now England looked aware of the danger of ridiculously letting slip two points against a team with scoring potential but possessed of too many weak links. Eriksson had replaced the ineffectual Defoe with Alan Smith in an attempt to breathe life into the team. That came from his captain. </p> <p>Butt, winning another tackle, supplied Beckham with a square pass wide on the left. One touch took him a few yards inside and from there his arcing shot landed in Jones's top left corner. </p> <p>It was game over as a contest, but Beckham now had the bit between his teeth, England scenting an improvement to their goal difference. Jones saved Beckham's volley from point-blank range, Gabbidon kicking away Rooney's shot from the rebound. Owen, desperate to score now, also saw his header well saved by Jones. </p> <p>The only sour note thereafter was Beckham's indiscipline in the shape of two late tackles on Ben Thatcher. Irresponsible? 'Let's talk about the goal instead,' said Eriksson. 'As long as it is 1-0, you are are never comfortable.' </p> <p>Now England are in control of the group, though, and even without Beckham should have sufficient depth to win on Wednesday. Germany, the land of Beckenbauer, beckons for 2006.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The recent strides made by Lawrie Sanchez's side have certainly not impressed Azerbaijan coach Carlos Alberto, who described Northern Ireland's football as 'shit' after a drab draw.</p> <p>Sanchez remains unbeaten in his seven away games since taking charge. But, it would appear, it takes more than mere statistics to impress the captain of Brazil's 1970 World Cup team.</p> <p>'I'm sick of having to play shit football teams like Northern Ireland and Wales,' he fumed. 'They committed over 100 fouls, but there was not one yellow card. If you think that is football, will you please applaud. Now I'm looking forward to playing England because they play much better football. They will probably beat us and we don't have much chance. But at least we will have the chance to show we can play football in the right way.'</p> <p>Sanchez refused to be drawn into a spat, claiming instead his side deserved to win the game. 'I don't make comments about other managers or their teams. I'm more concerned with my own team,' he said. 'I think this was obviously two points dropped for us because we had far and away the better chances.</p> <p>'I'm disappointed because we were the better team. We just lacked that little bit of quality to test the keeper more. But they always say, if you don't win, make sure you don't lose and we were never in any danger of losing.'</p> <p>Pinned back by an enterprising Azerbaijan team during a drab first half, Northern Ireland fought back impressively in the second period. But they were unable to find the finish that would have brought three crucial points and dramatically improved their standing in Group 6. Sanchez's belief that his side can make a genuine challenge to finish in the top two had been bolstered by last month's battling performance in Cardiff when, depleted by the dismissals of David Healy and Michael Hughes, Northern Ireland clung on to claim a deserved point.</p> <p>But deprived of Healy, Northern Ireland's threat in front of goal was always likely to be severely diminished. The Preston North End forward has struck seven of his side's eleven goals since Sanchez took charge and, starved of meaningful service, the new-look frontline of Hull City's Stuart Elliott and Willem II's James Quinn rarely looked capable of breaking the deadlock.</p> <p>The home side almost immediately exposed the visitors' patched-up right flank and worked the first clear opening of the game when Ismayil Mammadov worked his way to the by-line before cutting back to Mahmud Gurbanov on the edge of the box. Fortunately for Sanchez's side, the midfielder failed to test keeper Maik Taylor with a side-footed effort that flew wastefully wide.</p> <p>Azerbaijan continued to dominate possession although impressive defending by Northern Ireland's back three of Colin Murdock, Mark Williams and Aaron Hughes denied an opening of note inside Taylor's box.</p> <p>A darting run and cross from Damien Johnson aside, Northern Ireland's principle threat was always likely to come from a set piece and Murdock's towering header from Gillespie's corner was the closest the visitors came to forcing Jahnagir Hasanzade into action in a dismal first half.</p> <p>But after the break the visitors demonstrated much more purpose and, with Damien Johnson, Tommy Doherty and Jeff Whitley wresting control of the midfield, it was Northern Ireland who appeared most likely to make the breakthrough.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

The company prints a Paris Time Out in English and has an office in the French capital, but a French-language equivalent would be the first in a foreign tongue.</p> <p> Time Out is privately owned and Elliot has held talks with several venture capital groups with a view to selling a 15-20 per cent stake in the company but has not found a suitable partner. He would like to secure outside investment to speed up the group's global expansion, but is reluctant to surrender control of the company he founded over 25 years ago. </p> <p>Axel Springer's chairman and chief executive, Mathias Dopfner, wants to acquire assets outside the group's home market. The group, whose titles include broadsheet Die Welt and tabloid Bild, dominates the German newspaper industry and further expansion there is likely to be blocked by the competition authorities.</p> <p>Axel Springer made an unsuccessful bid for the Daily Telegraph and its Sunday sister title earlier this year.</p>",
  "<p>It should have been a harmonious moment. Nick Faldo had seemingly thrown away and then just clung on to win his third Open Championship in 1992, becoming the first Englishman to do so since Henry Cotton. His attempt at 'My Way' did nothing to ruin the mood. And then he turned to the crowd and thanked them from 'the bottom of my heart' before thanking the press from 'the heart of my bottom'.</p> <p>Fair enough, I remember thinking at the time. It was extraordinary how vilified Faldo was by the media. Before he won his second Open, and after he had won back-to-back Masters, some comments from Scott Hoch, of all sources, were parlayed into 'FALDO IS A PLONKER' in the Daily Mirror and 'WE ALL HATE NASTY NICK' in the Sun . If you think Tim Henman has it bad you should consider the treatment doled out to Faldo and then imagine how odd it would be if it were printed on the eve of Henman competing in not his first but second Wimbledon final, not his first but fourth grand-slam final. Nor was it just the written press. Television commentators, notably Peter Alliss, would coo about Sandy and Woosie before coming over all stern about Faldo.</p> <p>It all seemed so unfair. Faldo, like Geoff Boycott and Steve Davis, dedicated his life to being the best in the country in his chosen sport, but the more successful he was the less popular he became. All three of them were perplexed by the conundrum, Faldo most of all. For two decades they had wanted a great British champion, along he came, and it was as if he needn't have bothered.</p> <p>Thankfully, now that his professional career is in its dotage, people might decide he is at least half as decent a bloke as he was a player. He is staying in a discreet hotel in central London to publicise his ghost-written autobiography, Life Swings , when we meet. During the interview, he will move from crouching forward on an armchair as if reading a tricky putt, to lounging on it with his feet over one arm and his head thrown back over the other, looking more like a model than a golfer. Maybe, hardwired to see everything as a challenge, he felt able to relax when he realised it was no such thing. Maybe he was bored. Whichever, his changing position provides a relatively neat synopsis of his dealings with the media as he has moved from being a necessarily prickly individual to being an easygoing publicist.</p> <p>He admits in his book that 'public relations is one of the areas of my life to have changed significantly since V's [his third wife Valerie] arrival'. He has moved from being Nasty Nick to being a Hello! feature boy. Which is a shame in a way.</p> <p>It is, however, probably beneficial for his long-term health that he appears to have developed a carapace against criticism. 'As you mature you realise it's just words,' he says. 'If someone says you're great or if someone says you're shit there's no difference between them.'</p> <p>He realises how superficial the images created around sporting idols are. 'Once it's been written that Sandy [Lyle] is a warm and lovable guy, that's it. I'm cold and hard, that's it. Because you've been labelled a comedian you're deemed to be a comedian. If Lee [Trevino] walks on to the tee and says to the starter \"Ain't you dead, yet?\", that's funny. If I do it, it's \"That's a bit curt\". Once you have an image you're stuck with it.' Until, after you've retired, you have the time to do something about changing it.</p> <p>It is apt that his ghosted column in a newspaper is called The Secret Diaries of Nicholas Alexander Faldo because he shares one defining trait with Adrian Mole - they are both an only child. From the moment they were born they were the centre of attention. They have been spared sibling rivalries but deprived of sibling support. They, more than others, are used to getting their own way because there is no one else's way to get in the way. Faldo, in many respects, is an archetypal only child.</p> <p>His devoted parents afforded all the assistance to enable him to become a champion and he remains a devoted son. They gave him the space and funds to pursue his ambition and he was sufficiently grateful and dedicated not to abuse either.</p> <p>One of the more amazing statistics of Faldo's career is that within six years of swinging his first golf club he made it into the Ryder Cup team. This was due in large part to a period between the ages of 16 and 18, when every day he would go to the drab course at Welwyn Garden City and play imaginary games. 'Me versus Trevino, who fades, and Player, who hooks, or Nicklaus, the master tactician, and Palmer, the muscle man. I'd play all three balls, trying my hardest to mimic the style and strokes of my playing partners. I guess even then my ability to visualise was developing unwittingly.' He even, showing an early talent for golf-course design, went so far as to visualise imaginary bunkers and lakes to transform Welwyn Garden City into a more challenging and picturesque venue.</p> <p>'I self-taught myself a lot of things, which, 25 years later, sports psychologists would be putting into words,' he says.</p> <p>'The thing that amazed me was that my parents never double-checked on me. They must have just known that I was down on that range belting balls, happy as a sandboy. They gave me that trust. It's a very important thing for me. I hate that being broken. When people say they are going to do something and then they don't... it's just a pain.'</p> <p>Faldo's parents probably realised by then that they had a gifted and determined child on their hands. Before he took up golf, aged 13, Faldo had had success at individual sports ranging from swimming to throwing the cricket ball. He enjoyed both the challenge and the acclaim. 'It gave you a sense of something,' he says. 'If I won something then it would be read out in assembly and that's great. It gives you that glow, that little buzz inside.' A pattern had been established. He liked to win and he liked to be credited for it.</p> <p>The first tournament Faldo entered was a monthly medal and he shot a 72 minus five for a medal-winning 67, only to be disqualified - and how typical is this of the blazered world of golf - for having teed off at 10.45am when juniors weren't allowed on the course until 11. Faldo - and how typical is this of him - never played another monthly medal in his life.</p> <p>It is to his credit that he has had no truck with the pomposity that surrounds his sport and has invested time and money into the establishment of the Faldo Series to enable youngsters from a similar comprehensive-school background to attempt to emulate his achievements. 'We are slowly trying to break some of those barriers down,' he says.</p> <p>The Faldo Series is joined in the book's index by the Faldo Charitable Trust, Faldo Design, Faldo Enterprises, Faldo Golf Institute, and Faldo Selection. The last named being 'a range of Australian whites and reds which in my opinion represent the best quality for the price on the market'. Some golfers like wine, say Costantino Rocca or Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez, and concentrate on drinking it; others like wine, say Faldo or Greg Norman, and form their own label.</p> <p>Also in the index of his autobiography there is mention of 16 different Faldos, a number swelled by three marriages and four children. Family is very important to him, possibly because he was so single-minded that there wasn't much room for anyone else. Ever the professional when he started on tour, he didn't choose to room with anyone else for fear their nocturnal habits might disturb his regime. It was a sensible decision but made him appear stand-offish. It was also an impression that a fanatical pursuit of his career left him with no time or inclination to dispel.</p> <p>It also cost him both of his first two marriages. First, he married Melanie within seven weeks of their meeting. He writes, with a slight lack of self-awareness: 'I cannot understand why no one thought to grab me by the neck and say, \"Whoa! Slow down, pal...\".' Two reasons suggest themselves. There was no close friend: his best man, very worryingly, was his agent. And even if there had been would he have listened? His summation of the marriage is as follows: 'Melanie and I were happily married for six months. Unfortunately for both of us, we remained married for four-and-a-half years.'</p> <p>The rows started. 'I had never argued with anyone before in my life - family Faldo were not given to confrontation - yet there we were becoming increasingly embroiled in these awful screaming matches.' What is remarkable is not the marital discord but that Faldo had reached his mid-twenties without having an argument. Either he spent 25 years willingly doing everyone else's bidding or he had a quarter of a century of doing exactly what he wanted under his belt.</p> <p>The following passage suggests the latter. 'When Melanie used to complain, \"You think you're number one and everyone and everything revolves around you\", I would reply in all honesty, \"Guess what? At this moment in my golfing life I am number one and everything does revolve round me because I'm the one with the career. For now I'm the one generating the money to give us this fabulous lifestyle.\" That attitude had a positive effect on my career but a negative effect on my marriage, and I'm sorry if it makes me sound insensitive.'</p> <p>Just a touch, Nick, but maybe you need to be that driven to become a champion. And he has the grace to admit not only how difficult these passages were to write or read (you can never tell with a ghost in the picture) but also to having matured quicker as a golfer than a person.</p> <p>'As a golfer you gain experience every day,' he says. 'As a person maintaining a relationship it's a much harder thing. In golf you can analyse things right away. But if you upset someone and walk out of the door and don't realise there's a little volcano brewing and you've just waltzed off. You need a partner who completely understands what you are doing and it is hard for them to share in the joy of accomplishment. It's your little team you're doing it for, you're little family.' His third marriage, consolidated by a fourth child, and not under threat from an utterly obsessive career, may be luckier.</p> <p>If Faldo was hard on his early wives he was equally unforgiving to himself. The defining moment in his career, the one that would lead to his winning six majors, was when he voluntarily left the comfort zone of being one of the best golfers in the world to tear up his swing and start all over again in an attempt to become the best golfer in the world.</p> <p>'I just wanted more,' he says. 'I knew there was the possibility of more. In the '78 Open I was four [strokes] back, in '83 I was right in there and blew it. It was obvious I could get in there, but my game was just not good enough to finish it off.' Bad times followed. 'It was the worst two years. Horrible. I was really working hard, working so hard, all that practice and everything, and it's all a kick below the belt when you're two over after five and you think \"Oh...\".'</p> <p>The 'ohs' were replaced by 'ahs' to such an extent that Nick Price reckons Faldo could have won 12 majors. He is now phlegmatic about what might have been. 'Six is a good number. I would have loved to have won the grand slam but six is a good number. What you have to be happy with is that you gave it your best shot during a limited time period when you could make it all happen. You have to feel contented that that was your box. You don't want to think that you could have done more or you could have done better.'</p> <p>Faldo does seem, if not contented, not too disappointed with himself. And the book also allows him to show the humorous side to his character that was always there but, perhaps because of an antipathy between him and the press, seldom allowed into the open. It is illustrative that when talking about Seve Ballesteros he writes: 'I can still remember his victory speech in the press tent after winning the Westchester Classic: \"I was very lucky. At the 18th hole I hit my drive 310 yards... very lucky... next I hit big with a three-iron, high cut 12 feet from the hole, very lucky shot... then I hit my putt way out to the right, it swings back and drops straight in the hole... very lucky to hole that putt and make an eagle\".' If at Muirfield he had adopted the same approach the press, oblivious to any intended irony, might have loved him.</p> <p>This is an outcome that would have made his life easier. The childish need to have his achievements recognised in front of the school assembly hasn't been entirely eradicated and, still prickly after all these years, he continues to seek approval from unlikely sources for unlikely deeds. Writing about his third Masters menu - Harry Ramsden fish and chips with individual salt cellars and vinegar jars - he is 'delighted to say my choice was voted one of the three best dinners ever staged at Augusta, rated right up there with Ben Crenshaw's famous Texan barbecue and Vijay Singh's Thai and sushi evening'.</p> <p>Mentioning the barrage of programmes commissioned to celebrate British sporting success in the past century he writes: 'From mystery man you quickly become forgotten man. A moment which seemed to underline this was when I was invited to appear on the BBC's Century of Sport awards programme and I was afforded a whole three seconds of screen time.' Which is half-a-second for every major. Surely our attention spans have not become that diminished.</p> <p>Faldo is even buoyed by American golfer Peter Jacobsen describing him as 'the funniest Englishman since John Cleese'. It is a compliment that might have carried more weight if it had come from novelist Howard Jacobson rather than Peter Jacobsen and had 'was funny' tacked on the end, but, hey, the new relaxed Faldo will take what he's given.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Last week Gloucester went all superstitious in their attempt to change their fortunes against Bath. They spent some money on a hotel, despite the proximity of the away destination. Anything to break the voodoo: a seance, hypnotherapy. Whatever. They were still beaten.</p> <p>Yesterday they were at home, where they feel a little more secure. Harlequins have not won at Kingsholm since February 1999 and came this time boasting six from six this season. Defeats, that is.</p> <p>Gloucester opted for something a little more rooted in reality, like spending the week on the basics, such as bulking up the front row with Olivier Azam and the man the size of a Mendip, Christo Bezuidenhout. They also went for a bit of balance and pace in the back row, picking James Forrester and Andy Hazell alongside captain Jake Boer.</p> <p>The end result of the more rational approach? Well, it was as if they were still in their hypno-sleep. They were snoring away happily while Harlequins rattled up 10 points - a penalty by Jeremy Staunton and a try by Gavin Duffy, which started with one of those high kicks from Aussie scrum-half Matt Henjak that had 'trouble' written all over it.</p> <p>At least the try was the wake-up call. The real Gloucester appeared, not so much with the Henry Paul penalty that set them scoring, but with the scrummage that heaved Harlequins off their own ball. Bezuidenhout could not have been made to feel more welcome had he run in from 80 metres. As it was, the loose-head's blast led to possession against the head, and Duncan McRae's clever grubber was chased by James Simpson-Daniel.</p> <p>Downwind, Staunton kept Harlequins ahead with a second penalty, but the visitors surrendered their lead when McRae, Terry Fanolua and Paul exposed a little weakness in the midfield defensive chain. Fanolua surged through and Paul was on his shoulder.</p> <p>The point of weakness opened to become a running sore right at the start of the second half. Fanolua charged again, and through he went once more, this time without the need to pass to his midfield mate. It would happen again eight minutes later: Fanolua, bash, try. It exposed so much of what Harlequins have been suffering all season. They do so much heroically in defence and then leak soft tries.</p> <p>In attack they spilt a lot of ball, too. But between the Fanolua pair came a try by Will Greenwood that revealed a lot of shrewd invention. Neither Harlequins nor Greenwood may yet be spent forces. The centre used all his spatial awareness to check and then run back against the drift.</p> <p>The closing moments were dominated by Gloucester in the opposition 22. Phil Vickery came on and scampered around safely enough. And yet Harlequins escaped twice to put themselves within striking range of a losers' bonus point. The first opportunity was squandered, with Staunton missing a sitter of a penalty in front of the sticks. The second he landed and a point was earned, a small but potentially important reward for a club in trouble.</p> <p>Two weeks ago there was no news and no crisis in the Zurich Premiership. That Gloucester beat Harlequins hardly merits a banner headline, but it does leave the London club in real trouble. They do not look like complete wasters, but they have yet to win. And in the next month they face Leicester and Wasps in the Zurich, and Munster and Castres in the Heineken Cup. Hypnotherapy is not recommended.</p> <p><strong>Gloucester: </strong>Goodridge; Garvey, Fanolua (Bailey 76), Paul, Simpson-Daniel; McRae, Gomarsall; Bezuidenhout (Sigley 62), Azam (Fortey 58), Powell (Vickery 53), Buxton, Brown, Boer (capt), Hazell (Balding 53), Forrester. </p> <p><strong>Harlequins: </strong>Duffy (Jarvis 73); Harder, Greenwood, James, Monye; Staunton, Henjak; Jones, Fuga, Lambert (Dawson 67), Winters (Rudzki 62), Miall, Easter (Sherriff 71), Vos (capt), Diprose. </p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> A Spreadbury.</p>",
  "<p>Not even the pervasive influence of Bernie Ecclestone could prevent the prospect of a typhoon disrupting preparations for this morning's Japanese Grand Prix. The predicted arrival of Typhoon 22 yesterday brought the temporary closure of the Suzuka circuit and the postponement of qualifying until this morning, a few hours before the penultimate round of the championship was due to start. In the event, Typhoon 22 veered to the east and merely brushed this corner of the island of Honshu with only the stiffest of breezes. </p> <p>Assuming the rain, which has lashed the Suzuka area for more than 24 hours, had not caused flooding and allowed the rescheduled programme to be met this morning, life was always going to be difficult for the teams as they hurriedly prepared for a race without the benefit of running in the dry on Friday. This might not have been a worry for old hands such as Michael Schumacher and David Coulthard, but it presented an unwelcome hurdle for younger drivers making their first visit to one of the most complex tracks on the 18-race calendar. </p> <p>Even though Suzuka was built as long ago as 1962, it set a benchmark that not even the most imaginative new circuit of recent years has been able to match. The figure-of-eight design - the only such format in F1 - embraces every type of corner as it dips and climbs through steep hillsides that presented muddy and perilous perches this morning for many of the 100,000 spectators besotted by Formula One. </p> <p>There may have been a blip in the sport's popularity following the death in 1994 of Ayrton Senna - a local hero because of his exploits in Honda-powered cars - but Takuma Sato has done much to revive interest to the extent that the Japanese driver cannot move around Suzuka without being mobbed. Not even the persistent rain on Friday prevented fans from patiently lining the exit road in the hope of the merest glimpse of their hero. </p> <p>These bedraggled Japanese F1 supporters may be the lucky ones. Their British counterparts could be faced with making plans to travel abroad next year if uncertainty continues over the future of the grand prix at Silverstone. The governing body of motor sport, the FIA, is due on Wednesday to announce a calendar that is likely to show the British Grand Prix as being provisional pending discussions that have become as tedious as some of the races this season. </p> <p>Plans for the British Grand Prix took another twist on Thursday when a consortium of unknowns and minor motor-sport players had to call upon Nigel Mansell to give their bid to promote the race a semblance of credibility. The background of the new group, Brand Synergy, appeared to be as cloudy as the sky over Suzuka. Many F1 insiders here believe the mysterious group is nothing but a cover for Ecclestone in his bid to corner the increasingly beleaguered British Racing Drivers' Club, the owners of Silverstone. </p> <p>Ecclestone, who has not travelled to Japan, kept his feet, if not his powder, dry on Friday by offering the BRDC two further proposals. Details have not been released but it is believed that, typically, the plans favour Ecclestone despite his assertion to the contrary. It would be no surprise to find that these alternatives are designed to ease the BRDC into the hands of Brand Synergy. Either way, the future of the race was no clearer, with the betting here suggesting the British Grand Prix will not take place for the first time since 1950. </p> <p>Silverstone is similar to Suzuka in that it is frayed round the edges but possesses atmosphere and tradition, two elements that have been noticeable by their absence in Bahrain and Malaysia, and to a lesser degree in Shanghai, the recent additions to the calendar. It is a point that has not been lost on the teams, particularly those such as BAR-Honda that are based in England. </p> <p>'Tradition is a very important aspect of F1,' says David Richards, boss of BAR. 'But there has to be a balance; everything evolves, everything moves on. I don't think anyone would argue that the addition of Shanghai and that wonderful circuit there hasn't benefited F1. But so does keeping some of the older circuits going. It is my personal wish that the British Grand Prix should happen next year. </p> <p>'For BAR-Honda and many of the British-based teams, the commercial impact of not having the race, and the affect on all our factory-based staff [for whom the Silverstone race is the only opportunity to attend a grand prix] is not acceptable. We need to find a solution.' </p> <p>Given Ecclestone's relentless pursuit of the dollar and the downfall of the BRDC, some would say there is as much chance of the sun rising in the west. </p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>There is a stark difference between senility and maturity, as Australia have been demonstrating in Bangalore. When they arrived in India a fortnight ago, it was to a chorus of whispers that they were an ageing squad whose mission - to become the first Australia team to win in India since 1969- 70 - was sure to flounder in the baking heat and against India's swishing blades.</p> <p>That line of thought has been quashed, thanks to a surging performance that will give English optimists plenty to ponder before next summer's Ashes series. Barring a miracle, the match will have been wrapped up this morning. </p> <p> The hype surrounding this series has been immense and no aspect has been more puffed up than Shane Warne's return to a country where his 29 previous wickets have come at 55.44. But while he has dealt India's hopes two killer blows, with the scalp of VVS Laxman in each innings, it has been another of Australia's old stagers who has slipped back on to centre stage. </p> <p> Since taking nearly a year out of the game after ankle surgery, Glenn McGrath's protestations that he has never felt better have fallen on largely deaf ears. But at 34, McGrath has been insuperable. In his first two overs, he took a wrecking ball to India's first innings by dealing out ducks to Aakash Chopra and, crucially, Rahul Dravid and in the second innings he completed a hat-trick of blanks for India's top three by nailing Virender Sehwag. </p> <p> McGrath's age-old virtues of line, length and imperceptible seam movement have epitomised Australia's new softly-softly approach. That Kolkata defeat of 2001, when Laxman and Dravid added 376 in the follow-on to set up a stunning win, has not been allowed to slip far from anyone's thoughts here. That is largely because of an off-the-pace India performance that has seemingly been waiting for inspiration to slap them in the face, but also because of a certain fiery young Sikh called Harbhajan Singh, who slipped beneath the radar to grab 11 more wickets, including his sixth five-wicket haul in consecutive home Tests against Australia. </p> <p> However, Australia have been planning for all eventualities and during the build-up to this series, Adam Gilchrist, their stand-in captain in the absence of Ricky Ponting, said that the team's gameplan had veered towards the reckless on their previous visit. Gilchrist had been particularly culpable then, so his hundred in Australia's first innings this time around was one of the sweetest moments of his career. After watching Matthew Hayden top-edge Harbhajan straight to deep midwicket, Gilchrist resolved to abolish the sweep and instead chose to play straight to the spin of Harbhajan and Anil Kumble. The upshot was 104 from 109 balls. Even in cautious mode, Gilchrist is explosive. </p> <p> Gilchrist's innings, however, was just a footnote to the central tale of the Australia innings. It is a measure of the consistency and competitiveness of Australia's top-order that, since Darren Lehmann made his debut for Australia on this ground in 1997-98, they have handed out caps to just three other batsmen - Simon Katich in 2001, Martin Love in 2002-03 and now Michael Clarke, a 23-year-old bottleblond from New South Wales. </p> <p> Clarke was given his chance by Ponting's thumb injury and he seized it with a nerveless debut century, which he converted into a wonderful 151. As if that was not enough, he cemented his all-time place in Australian folklore when, with a hundred in sight, he cast aside his helmet and called for the Baggy Green. Steve Waugh would have been proud. </p> <p> All in all, it has been a dispiriting week for India. Sachin Tendulkar, whose elbow injury has not prevented him from earning the loudest cheers of the match whenever he has appeared in the middle on 12th-man duty, is expected to return for the second Test in Chennai, starting on Thursday, and although the team would seek to deny it, they miss his influence. </p> <p> Apart from anything else, there is no one more adept at soaking up the huge burden of expectation on the team each time they set foot on a cricket field. 'I am not a god,' said Harbhajan, in response to criticism of his first-innings performance. Maybe not, but we all know who is. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> South Africa players Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje are to answer questions sent to them by the Indian police as part of an investigation into match-fixing. The United Cricket Board of South Africa, who have sought assurances from the Board of Control for Cricket in India and the ICC that the pair would not be detained during South Africa's tour to India next month, will hand affidavits from the players to the Indian High Commission in South Africa.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "The stars are Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken. The director is Tony Scott, known for blockbusters such as Top Gun and Crimson Tide. But the identity of the writer of Man on Fire, the bestseller that hits the big screen in Britain this weekend, has been a riddle for a quarter of a century. Until now. <p>The film, starring Washington as a mercenary bodyguard, has been a hit in America, and the book on which it is based has sold 7.4 million copies worldwide in 20 languages. It is credited simply to 'AJ Quinnell', the pseudonym of a man about whom virtually nothing is known. </p> <p>Now Quinnell has broken a 25-year silence to give The Observer his first newspaper interview. The enigma behind 12 books that have earned a cult following around the globe - four more are under option in Hollywood - is revealed as a thrice-married Briton who travelled the world, took up his pen after a chance encounter with the Mafia and borrowed his alter ego from a Welsh rugby player. </p> <p>Man on Fire is a critically praised story of a kidnapping in Italy (the movie version transfers it to Mexico). Now in his early sixties, Quinnell recalled the Mafia's role in its genesis: 'I was flying from Tokyo to Hong Kong, and the man next to me had a heart attack. He was elderly and obviously very wealthy, dripping with gold. The flight crew were going to call an ambulance from the general hospital, which would have been a disaster, because it's a huge government hospital and not very efficient. But I knew the captain and persuaded him to call a private hospital instead. </p> <p>'Two days later, a lot of young men in smart suits turned up. It transpired the man was a member of one of the old Italian families. They said if I ever needed help I should get in contact. The man subsequently died, but when it came to researching my book, I had the name of his son, who put me in touch with his lawyer in Rome, who put me in touch with various people I wanted to talk to. </p> <p>'They didn't actually come out of it very well: the juxtaposition of the violence that went on in those days with the very kind people I met at the hospital was extraordinary. When I wrote the book, I said to them I'd change all their names, but they refused. I said, \"Look, you all die terribly.\" They said, \"We don't care, we want to be in the book,\" so I left them in.' </p> <p>Quinnell has repeatedly shunned publicity and few of his publishers know his real name, which he asked The Observer not to disclose. He explained: 'When I was finishing that book, I had another at the back of my mind, The Mahdi, long before the Salman Rushdie fatwa. It wasn't particularly anti-Islamic, but it was a spy story which involved Islam, Mecca and so on. I wanted freedom of movement, so I decided to take a pen name at that point. </p> <p>'I chose the name Quinnell when I was in a bar at home. My agent rang me up and said, \"Look, if you want a pen name, give it to me now because they need to start printing.\" I used to play a lot of rugby and remembered the Welsh player Derek Quinnell. I sent that off and the agent came back and said, \"You need initials or a first name.\" The bartender's son was AJ, so I took that. </p> <p>'Curiously enough, when you use a pen name and no one knows your real name, not even your publisher, you get people who suddenly tell their friends they're AJ Quinnell. It can be a little strange.' </p> <p>Quinnell - who still writes in longhand using a felt-tip pen - was born in Nuneaton during a German air raid. His childhood was spent in Tanzania and at boarding school in West Yorkshire. At 20, he became a trader in Hong Kong. He has been married for nine years to Elsebeth Egholm, a detective novelist 20 years his junior. They divide their time between her native Denmark and what he describes - with an air of mystery - as 'an island in the Mediterranean'. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.smith@observer.co.uk\">david.smith@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>The thriller <strong> Man on Fire</strong>, according to the production notes, 'marked the culmination of a 20-year odyssey by director Tony Scott', which is twice the time it took Ulysses to get from Troy to Ithaca (though the latter did not manage to make Top Gun or Beverly Hills Cop II along the way). </p> <p>This is a characteristic Scott movie in the high-octane blockbuster style he learnt working for Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, taking him down Mexico way, where he went in the late Eighties for a similar trip, called Revenge . </p> <p>This is that dark, dangerous Mexico, 'so far from God, so near the United States,' as Porfirio Diaz put it. The burned-out, alcoholic Creasy (Denzel Washington) goes there to act as bodyguard to Pita (Dakota Fanning), the 10-year-old daughter of a rich Mexican businessman and his blonde American wife (Radha Mitchell). He's a former assassin for the US government's counter-insurgency division and in search of redemption. </p> <p>'Do you think God will forgive us for what we've done?' he asks his old CIA chum, Christopher Walken. After reluctantly bonding with his young charge, Creasy is nearly killed when she's kidnapped and drags himself from his bed to go on a rampage, torturing and killing anyone associated with the abduction. </p> <p>Adapted by Brian Helgeland from a 1980 novel set in Italy, the movie has been switched to Mexico City because it's now the world capital of kidnapping for profit (though Baghdad probably holds the title pro tem) and the place is presented as a polluted hell, rotten to the core. </p> <p>Only an honest middle-aged cop and a crusading journalist stand up to the universal corruption and they unite in helping to unleash Creasy. It's an exciting tale, roughly an hour too long, and marred as always by Scott's self-conscious artiness, a legacy of days shooting commercials. There's slow motion, fast motion, hectic editing, pounding music and even the sub-titles are designed to jump up and hit you between the eyes. Denzel Washington is his commanding, jaw-clenching self and Dakota Fanning (whose name sounds to me like a Midwest company manufacturing air-conditioners) shows once again that she's the most accomplished child actor at work today.</p>",
  "<p>Why Bobby Darin? The first thing that comes to mind is that he's been forgotten. There are all those tributes to the Rat Pack guys, Dean [Martin] and Frank [Sinatra], yet you look at all these kids who win Pop Idol contests and do their first albums and what music do they do? They do Bobby's because they want to prove they can sing. </p> <p>The point is that his music is all around us, yet if you say the name Bobby Darin to a younger generation they go 'Who?' And then, if you sing four lines of any of his songs, they go, 'Oh, yeah.' That's true in any country; his music's really international, but people don't know his name. </p> <p>Unlike a remarkable artist like Frank Sinatra, who found a style and did it for 40 years better than anybody else, Bobby kept re-inventing himself. This meant that although he was discovered in rock'n'roll, he moved into pop, folk, country and western, gospel, protest songs against the Vietnam War: walk into a record store and Bobby's in every section. </p> <p>My dad had a 78rpm record collection, so I grew up with the same music that Bobby Darin grew up listening to: he was obsessed with the big bands. This kid had talent, and because his mother was in vaudeville - she was known as the woman who could sing three octaves - Bobby learnt music from a very young age. When he got rheumatic fever - his first attack was at the age of eight - he stayed at home with his mother and listened to her records for months and months at a time. </p> <p>I got the rights to do this movie in 1999, but my own mother got ill with a brain tumour and I decided to stop everything. After she died I suddenly had all this time on my hands. I had hired a writer and had a very nice script, but it still felt as if something was missing. It needed to go in a new direction to avoid it being a cookie-cutter version of someone's life story. Gradually I worked out a concept for the story. </p> <p>I had to get the film made in 2003; that was it. And I knew that if I didn't get it done, I would never do the movie because there would never be the opportunity. I knew I was coming to the Old Vic for the long haul and also know what it takes to direct a film. It would take a year-and-a-half out of my life. </p> <p>The most rewarding 12 days I have ever spent were in the Abbey Road studio with a 48-piece orchestra laying down all the tracks before we started shooting with Phil Ramone, my music producer, and John Wilson, my musical director. These genius guys completely understood how to capture the sound and the spirit of Bobby. </p> <p>As the film is released toward the end of the year across America, I'll be hitting the country on the 'Beyond the Sea' tour: an evening celebrating the music of Bobby Darin. That's all about using this music to introduce this movie and this man who, I believe, is probably next to Sammy Davis Jnr as the greatest nightclub entertainer we've ever had. My aim is to bring attention to his entire catalogue. </p> <p>All of the issues about whether I'm too old to play this part will go away when people see the movie: it is not a linear story at all, not even close, it's just something else. I can't quite describe it because I don't want to define it. It's not what people will expect and it's not a biopic: this couldn't be more different from De-Lovely [the recent film about Cole Porter]. It's the movie my mother wanted me to do more than any movie I've ever done. It's my personal statement.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Timewaster Letters</strong> <br><strong> Robin Cooper</strong> </p> <p>Michael O'Mara \u00a39.99, pp192 </p> <p>In the tradition of the Henry Root letters comes a new collection of letters that do what the title describes. The time wasted, however, is not the reader's - only the terminally humourless could fail to be delighted by this volume - but that of the many put-upon secretaries and public relations officials who have been naive enough to take Robin Cooper's enquiries seriously and respond to them. </p> <p>Only the fact that life is so often stranger than invention can have prevented these people from spotting that Cooper's letters were obviously spoofs. He writes to the publishers Dorling Kindersley proposing his children's book, 'Kelly Telly and his Smelly Belly'; the United Kingdom Spoon Collectors' Club; the Ball and Roller Bearing Manufacturers' Association for advice on his son's uncontrollable ball bearing fetish, as well as more prominent bodies such as Ikea and the Liberal Democrats. </p> <p>What makes these letters glorious is the flawless deadpan of Cooper's style - 'Thank you ever so much for your charming letter of 12 March (the date, incidentally, of my mother's birthday!) But that is, sadly, irrelevant' - which engenders entirely serious responses - 'Dear Mr Cooper, I'm afraid we have been unable to identify the manufacturer of your wife's hair station and are therefore unable to help you'. </p> <p>That Cooper's book comes garlanded with praise from leading comics - Matt Lucas, Sally Phillips, Ricky Gervais and Avid Merrion, to name-check but a few - offers a clue as to his true identity; Cooper is the alter-ego of Robert Popper, former comedy producer at Channel 4 and co-author of the Bafta-nominated BBC2 series Look Around You. </p> <p>If it has a deeper purpose, the book exposes the absurdities of a PR industry obliged for the sake of customer relations to humour even the most insane requests. If you don't laugh out loud, write and ask for your money back.</p>",
  "<p>There are those who lift your spirits, and those who keep you on your toes. Professor John Kenneth Galbraith has lifted the spirits of several generations of politicians, officials, economists, students and general readers around the world. He has also kept them on their toes. </p> <p>Galbraith is due to celebrate his 96th birthday this coming Friday. When I had lunch with him and his wife of 67 years, Catherine, in their house just outside the Harvard campus last week, it was a perfect day, autumn was beginning and the great man was in fighting form, despite still being in a wheelchair after a recent illness. He was also struggling with various deaf-aids, but the spirit was, as always, indomitable. </p> <p>I was carrying a copy of his latest book The Economics of Innocent Fraud , in which he attacks politicians and the media for colluding 'in the myths of a benign \"market\" that big business always knows best, that minimal intervention stimulates the economy, that obscene pay gaps and unrestrained self-enrichment are an inevitable by-product of the system'. </p> <p>It is, as he remarked, his 'smallest book, but has taken the longest amount of time'. He had been working on it when we last met two years ago, but he rewrote in between stays in hospital, after the fall-out from the Enron crisis proved a dramatic illustration of his thesis that there is nothing that unfettered chief executives will not do to feather their own nests. </p> <p>Before signing my copy, Galbraith drew my attention to the illustration on the cover. 'This is the roughest thing I've ever had on a book of mine - an executive briefcase scattering bombs!' In a world where US foreign policy in Iraq has been dictated by Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and others with strong corporate links, Galbraith, who has campaigned about the power of large corporations since The Affluent Society (1958) and The New Industrial State (1967), is, as it were, sticking to his guns. </p> <p>My own association with Galbraith is a long one. The Affluent Society contained a powerful Keynesian attack on the classical economists who held that unemployment was something about which governments could do little. Galbraith, following Keynes, writes like a dream, and reading The Affluent Society was one of the factors that led a number of my generation to study economics. It is not for nothing that another great influence, the Nobel prize-winning Amartya Sen, describes Galbraith as 'the most widely read economist in the world'.</p> <p>Alas, later in our conversation, Galbraith went on to lament 'this is the only government in 30 or 40 years with no one in authority who has ever heard of John Maynard Keynes'. But we are jumping ahead. As Catherine Galbraith offered a glass of sherry, the professor boomed: 'I'm still partly crippled, but alcohol is still remedial.'</p> <p>Then, before I could ask a question, he sailed in. 'Let's start with a few problems I have. Is Blair in trouble?' I said he ought to be, but it might be wishful thinking on my part, and reminded him of Lord Hailsham's dictum that the British political system is an 'elective dictatorship'. </p> <p>Galbraith continued: 'It's a strange political calculation of his to stay for so long in support of George Bush. Why did he do that?' I said his bafflement was shared by many here. </p> <p>The wise professor, who has advised both FD Roosevelt and JF Kennedy in his time, went on to express very strong views: 'It is not a good design for relations with the US because the active voices in this country on international policy are all in conflict with Bush.' What the 'special relationship' needed was 'a certain deeper association and alliance with someone who is responsibly critical. For whatever reason, that has not been the case in Britain'. </p> <p>In Galbraith's view the French were more in tune with reality. 'Politics must take account not only of the position of the government but also of the forces behind it, and Blair does not have the support of the articulate in the US.' </p> <p>He added: 'And that is the group which has always thought well of a certain allied relationship with Britain.' He paused. 'There was a better decision by Winston Churchill!' </p> <p>At this stage I tried to move the conversation back to The Economics of Innocent Fraud and get him to say something about Conrad Black, his fellow Canadian, with whom I recalled he had not been too enamoured on a previous occasion. But he would not be moved. </p> <p>'Why has Britain been so tolerant of George Bush and his gang?' He smiled, adding, 'I always interview the reporter.' </p> <p>I did my best to answer this. He then said that perhaps it was partly because 'a lot of things important to the US do not have the same repercussions in Britain'. </p> <p>Warming to his theme, he said: 'This is a crude government, and its crude misdirection of power in minor things has more direct impact domestically than abroad.' Such as? </p> <p>'One of the worst things - unimaginable in Britain - is the open character of legislation for the rich, particularly on taxation; and the open resistance to support for the poor.' </p> <p>But that was not all. 'When income tax reductions,' he pauses and revises 'reductions' to 'slashes', 'were put into effect they were combined with this warning: \"Let's not open the way for a softer policy for the poor and the unemployed\" - a softer policy that in Keynesian terms might have been a more im portant factor in alleviating the recession.' </p> <p>Many people enter their 'anecdotage' at ages much younger than Galbraith's. Although he was happy to reminisce, he kept returning to the gravity of the present US and world scene. </p> <p>'We are seeing the disintegration of the American economic and wider world role, which could well continue after this election. I am talking about the passage of power to the Rumsfelds of the economic and political structure.' </p> <p>In his new book, Galbraith points out that in the fiscal year 2003 'close to half the total of US government discretionary expenditure [outlay not mandated for particular use, such as social security or service of the public debt] was used for military purposes - for defence, as more favourably it is called'. </p> <p>In one sense, as he acknowledges, little has changed since President Eisenhower warned in the 1950s of a 'military industrial complex'. As Galbraith says, 'a large, vital and expanding part of what is called the public sector is for all practical effect in the private sector... much [arms expenditure] is at the initiative and with the authority of the arms industry and its political voice - the private sector. </p> <p>Galbraith gave a dire warning of what would happen if Bush was re-elected. 'Under the thrust of power of present forces, including the money-making powers, there's going to be a continuing and disastrous [American] decline. The Rumsfelds and the Cheneys will still be there, and anyone with a grasp of world history should be here to report it.' He smiled and said: 'Why don't you do that?' </p> <p>The great man feels passionately. 'In all my 90-odd years, I've never had such a clear view of the future,' adding with a twinkle in his eye, 'with still, of course, the possibility of being wrong.' But only the possibility. 'I have a feeling that not since the end of World War Two have we had such a time when the role of wisdom, action and misunderstanding in the US has such worldwide consequences.' </p> <p>He says he is now working on a new book. With that he was assisted into a chair (made in Newcastle, England) that hoisted him up the stairs, as if on a domestic funicular railway, for his afternoon nap. </p> <p>As he disappeared from sight he called out: 'There's just one more thing.' His nurse brought down a car bumper sticker, with a picture of George Bush. The slogan was: 'Some things were never meant to be recycled.'</p>",
  "<p>Big bank, big money, big egos. A potentially heady concoction at the best of times and no more so than at Lazard, the pukka investment house that is lining up a $3 billion flotation on Wall Street next year. </p> <p>Things are never simple at Lazard, which spans operations in Paris, London and New York, and where office politics can be brutal, even by City standards. In the past, Lazard has been riven by infighting and turf wars; its semi-autonomous offices in Europe and the United States doing little to conceal their contempt for each other. </p> <p>Now, Lazard's flotation proposals, put forward by its American boss, Bruce Wasserstein, have sparked more arguments, which have burst into the open, much to the chagrin of the old guard, who usually eschew publicity. </p> <p>Last week one broke cover to say: 'Whoever is leaking these stories [citing dissent within the firm over the terms of the float] should be strung up. It's quite disgraceful.' </p> <p>Disgraceful it might be, but where money and power are so important, there are bound to be disagreements about the carve-up of the spoils. Not everyone wants to abandon the partnership structure for a new life as a public com pany. Goldman Sachs, which floated in 1999, experienced a similar internal debate, although less fractious.</p> <p>For Lazard the questions that are most vexing are these: who is eligible for equity in the event of a float? And how much should each individual get? Inevitably that leads to another question: why should he or she get more than me? Those disputes are common enough following the distribution of City bonuses each year; in fact, no issue is more divisive in an investment bank. </p> <p>Throw into this pot several larger-than-life personalities - senior operatives with searing intellects working in an environment where there is a degree of insecurity about one's ability to pull off the next deal - and you have a recipe for... well, let's just say creative tension.</p> <p>The latest twist to the Lazard story can be traced to the arrival of Wasserstein, the legendary Wall Street dealmaker, brought in to lead the firm by chairman Michel David-Weill four years ago. </p> <p>Prior to Wasserstein's arrival, Lazard was in trouble. Senior partners such as John Nelson and Nigel Turner left or were poached by rivals. Their departures heralded an era when Lazard began slipping down the investment-banking league tables. </p> <p>At about the same time, the firm was rocked by the sudden departure of Bill Loomis, who fell out with David-Weill, a descendant of the founding French families and septuagenarian aristocrat who is both demanding and patrician in his approach.</p> <p>But in Wasserstein, David-Weill appears to have met his match, the former insisting that he be ceded overall managerial control before coming aboard. As soon as Wasserstein was installed, there was little doubt in City circles that his endgame was to either sell or float Lazard. </p> <p>Stories soon began circulating about Wasserstein phoning rival bankers whom he was keen to recruit. He promised chunky bonuses and large amounts of equity that could be realised in the event of a sale or flotation. Wasserstein brought in some big names, pushing Lazard back up the league tables. Suddenly the firm, whose mainstay is advising companies on mergers, acquisitions and restructurings, was coming into its own again. </p> <p>Its partners were involved in multi-billion-pound deals involving Pfizer, the pharmaceuticals giant, as well as the the Bank One merger with JP Morgan in the US, and the sale of the Telegraph titles to the Barclay brothers in Britain.</p> <p>But before long, Wasserstein had his first public spat with David-Weill. The chairman was incensed that the American had been spending so much on recruiting top dealmakers that there was less money in the form of dividends for Lazard's capitalists, or non-working partners, who occupy five of the 11 seats on the board. Somehow the rift was healed.</p> <p>David-Weill's friends say he has never championed a float, but he will not use his veto to block one. Now it is believed that, after weeks of negotiations, he and other non-working partners - who own a sizeable stake of Lazard - have agreed to sell out in the event of an IPO. But there is a condition: David-Weill will not go ahead unless Wasserstein has the full support of the working partners, and not all have agreed.</p> <p>As a consequence, Wasserstein was forced to delay his plans last week after a board meeting in Paris. And he has had to soften his stance with the dissidents - initially he set a deadline of last Wednesday for them to agree to flotation, then backtracked to give them more time. The dissidents are concerned about how equity will be divided, and how much power will be concentrated in Wasserstein's hands. Some spoke of dictatorial tendencies. </p> <p>People who know him rebut such suggestions: 'Whatever people say, Bruce is a most benign dictator, and a brilliant negotiator; if anyone can pull off a deal, he can.' </p> <p>But this is Lazard, and despite his success in breaking down barriers between London, New York and Paris, there are many influential and astute players within the firm - men like Georges Railly, one of the leading partners at the Paris office. The dissidents speak for a quarter of Lazard's annual income, so they cannot be easily dismissed. But the latest talk was that many had been won round, and that Wasserstein will get to float Lazard in the spring.</p> <p>Not that the story will end there. A New York analyst said: 'Once Lazard floats, you can bet that the directors won't rest till the bank is sold to a larger competitor, although selling investment banks is not as easy a task as it used to be.'</p> <p>Nor should we discount the possibility of a trade sale if an IPO fails to materialise.</p> <p>Lazard, as a public company with a primary listing in New York, under the full glare of Wall Street's number- crunchers, is still a strange notion to those whose image of the firm is of a discreet sounding board for companies in search of impartial advice. Even now, it's not clear why Lazard needs to float - the firm doesn't need to raise funds to bolster its balance sheet. </p> <p>But an IPO will tidy up Lazard's messy shareholder structure, give David-Weill and his allies an exit, and make Wasserstein and his colleagues a great deal of money. Incentives enough.</p> <p><strong>King of 1,000 deals</strong></p> <p>'Bid 'em up' Bruce Wasserstein is synonymous with the image of the brash, no-nonsense American banker. Wasserstein, 56, caught the world's attention in the late 1980s when he was involved in a deal that saw KKR, the US buyout specialist, acquire tobacco giant RJR Nabisco for $25 billion, the largest buyout deal of the time. </p> <p>Since then, the deals have come thick and fast. Wasserstein advised Dean Witter on its takeover of Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley and Wal-Mart on its purchase of Asda.</p> <p>He was involved with the $180 billion merger of AOL and Time Warner. In total, he has been linked to 1,000 deals on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>After he sold his firm, Wasserstein Pirella, to Dresdner of Germany - a transaction that is reported to have netted him a cool $650m - he fell out with his new master after it was absorbed by German insurer Allianz. Allianz blocked Wasserstein's plan to spin off and float the investment-banking arm, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.</p> <p>When the call came from Michel David-Weill to head Lazard, Wasserstein was happy to bid farewell to his German employers.</p>",
  "They seem to have little in common: a right-wing New Zealander who transformed his party's fortunes with hardline rhetoric on race, and Tony Blair's famously pessimistic polling guru. <p>But senior Tories have alighted on both Don Brash, leader of the New Zealand National Party, and focus group king Philip Gould as they scour the globe seeking ideas to steal for the next election. Gould may be a surprising choice, but shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin - who last week confessed to buying his book about Blairism, The Unfinished Revolution - admits that the pollster's argument that the ground must be carefully and repeatedly softened up ahead of major policy changes provided inspiration for his own strategy on tax. </p> <p>'One of the things that struck me most [about the book] is that if you are going to say \"X\" at a given moment, you need to have said \"A, B, C, D, E, F\" before you get to X in order that X is read in the way you mean it,' Letwin said. </p> <p>Gould argues that endless repetition of ideas is essential because voters tune into politics so intermittently - a tactic in evidence at last week's Tory party conference, where most of the policies 'unveiled' had already been announced, some by Iain Duncan Smith's regime. </p> <p>Letwin admitted 'we have all been reading everything we could find about campaigns that were successful', including John Howard's 1990s comeback in Australia and George Bush's 2000 election. </p> <p>However, the most intriguing inspiration for last week's tough talk on crime and immigration - tempered by Michael Howard's emotional recollections of his immigrant past - is Brash, who met the Tory leader for private talks in the summer. </p> <p>Elected leader shortly before Howard's own coronation, Brash interests Tory strategists because he inherited a similarly despairing party. Unlike Howard, he has demolished a 15-point Labour Party lead over his party with a populist platform of opposition to Maori rights, which he argues have disadvantaged poor indigenous whites, tough crime policies and attacks on the 'grievance industry' of reparations for infringements of minority rights. </p> <p>Allegations of playing the race card do not appear to have stuck - partly because his wife is Chinese, giving him similar credentials to Howard, the son of Jewish immigrants. The Tories' summer offensive on crime, immigration and the 'compensation culture' of suing for infringements of human rights suggests intriguing parallels. Maori rights was a 'hard issue for a lot of people to deal with without being accused of being racist', says one former National Party aide. </p> <p>'Brash made a speech in which he said we have to live as one people under one set of laws with no favouritism, and it really hit a chord with the public. The polling turned round within weeks.' </p> <p>Howard used his keynote conference speech to outline tough policies on drugs, crime and immigration, as did shadow Home Secretary David Davis. Liam Fox, the Tory co-chairman, told The Observer 's conference fringe meeting that Tories had been 'cowed by a left-leaning, politically correct culture' out of discussing asylum. </p> <p>While Howard has had little time for new policies, he did present them last week in new wrapping, devised largely by thirtysomething Michael Moszynski, who heads an offshoot of the M&amp;C Saatchi advertising empire called Immediate Sales. The agency offers what it calls 'brutal simplicity of thought' - the condensing of ideas into short, clear messages. </p> <p>Briefed to portray the party as one that 'gets things done', Moszynski devised the revamped Tory torch logo, borne by an arm with a rolled-up sleeve to indicate readiness for action. He also provided the slogan 'a timetable for action', involving ministers pledging to take certain actions within their first day in power. </p> <p>The final weapon was stardust: a dinner in London for celebrities to meet Howard - hosted by Charlotte Church's agent, Jonathan Shalitt- was followed by the arrival in Bournemouth of a train full of minor celebrities including a former girlfriend of Mick Jagger and LBC presenter Caroline Feraday. </p> <p>The emphasis on celebrity has, however, prompted wild thinking among some MPs unconvinced that a slick rebranding will win them the election. If Howard does badly, some are talking of a 'Schwarzenegger solution', making MP and television personality Boris Johnson leader to emulate the buzz created by the election of Schwarzenegger as governor of California. <br> <b>Spin vs Substance</b><br> <b> Spin</b> The Tories claim their polling shows that they are four points ahead in Labour's 130 most vulnerable seats. </p> <p><b> Reality</b> No one at Central Office has been able to explain the full details of the polling sample, raising doubts about the figure's reliability. </p> <p><b> Spin</b> Within the first week of a Conservative government, the Home Secretary will announce the ending of Labour's early release from prison scheme. Within the first week he will start his new prison-building programme. </p> <p><b> Reality</b> One of the reasons Labour has introduced the early release scheme is that prisons are full. It seems odd to promise that criminals will spend more of their sentence in prison before building new ones to house them. David Davis has yet to explain how he will square these policies. </p> <p><b> Spin</b> The Health Secretary will abolish targets imposed by Whitehall on hospitals. </p> <p><b> Reality</b> Introducing this on day one, rather than phasing it in, risks chaos. The Tories have not explained what the targets would be replaced with on day two. The whole NHS is geared up to hit targets and it is difficult to see what benefit would come from their immediate abandonment, however unpopular they are with health professionals. </p> <p><b> Spin</b> Within a month of coming to office, the Conservatives would publish a Bill introducing a presumption of co-parenting and equal rights for both parents in the case of separation. </p> <p><b> Reality</b> Children's Minister Margaret Hodge argues that the opposition has not seen fit to table an amendment to this effect in the Children Bill going through parliament and has not clarified whether this means the rights of the parents should have precedence over the rights of the child. </p> <p><b> Spin</b> Howard described from the platform a Saturday night out in Brixton where in two hours he didn't see a single policeman, suggesting inner cities were abandoned by the forces of law and order. </p> <p><b> Reality</b> Detective Chief Inspector Glynn Jones of Brixton suggested Howard should 'go and shove it'. The only recorded crimes that night were one robbery, one burglary and one serious incident. </p> <p><b> Martin Bright</b></p>",
  "<p>The call came in from somewhere out on the rain-slicked New Jersey Turnpike. Could they please hold the curtain at tonight's benefit performance of The Owl and the Pussycat at Manhattan's City Center? Pleasepleasepleasepleasepleeeeease?</p> <p>Kimora Lee Simmons, the dynamo director of Baby Phat fashions, was in the back seat of her extra-long platinum Bentley, running half an hour late. Did it mean anything to anyone that she was the chairwoman, yes, the chairwoman of the event? 'There are rules for these things. The show will start on time,' somebody had to tell her. Ralph and Ricky Lauren were in the house. So were Diane von Furstenberg, Oscar de la Renta, and Zac Posen, the 23-year-old who had crafted Kimora's gown, with the loopy swish that looked like a conch. </p> <p>Kimora's husband, Russell Simmons, arrived at the theatre in his white Ford Excursion. The affable co-founder of Def Jam Records, Russell, who had recently sold his Phat Fashions clothing company for $140m, joined the ladies with fur wraps inside as they awaited US Vogue editor-at-large Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley's turn onstage with the Martha Graham dance troupe. As the performance got under way, Kimora sneaked in through a side entrance and she and Russell sat down, holding hands.</p> <p>After the show, there was a dinner dance at the Plaza, where Russell and Kimora were seated with Anna Wintour. But Kimora was distracted. There was something for sale in the silent auction outside, and she wanted to go home with it. 'Unprecedented fantasy opportunity to have Mr Blahnik name a shoe in your honor', the sign said.</p> <p>Kimora slipped out to the vestibule to keep an eye on the prize. 'Did no one hear me on the microphone? I said, \"No one go mess with the Manolo Blahniks! I'm the chairwoman!\"' she joked. Kimora got on a mobile phone with a Minneapolis doctor whose wife was there fishing for a birthday present. 'You're making me look bad,' Kimora said to him in her jingling, cash-money voice. 'Tell your wife I will give you a pair of mine. Let's just collaborate.' The doctor caved in, and somebody chided Kimora for her furtive price-fixing. But there was other competition. Kimora found herself toe-to-toe with Suzanne Levine, a podiatrist celebrated for tending to the ailments of the high-high-heeled. 'I don't know why Manolo Blahnik would want to name a shoe after a podiatrist, but whatever,' someone in the crowd whispered. 'It's my livelihood,' Levine kept saying.</p> <p>Kimora Lee was a more obvious Cinderella for the slipper. Born out of wedlock, this woman-child from the Midwest had willed herself on to the runways of Europe as a model and was now the high-living other half of the city's most fascinating power couple. </p> <p>A man shouted that he was the lawyer for Dr Suzanne Levine, so nobody should try anything funny. 'I want you to make sure no one does this to me, Jack,' said Kimora to her lawyer and manager, Jack McCue. But the hands on her diamond-flecked watch touched 12, and Russell dragged Kimora back to her car. The shoe was hers, or so she thought. But then Levine bid a final $20,000 on a piece of folded paper, and after a protracted cellular exchange with McCue from the car, Kimora decided she had enough Manolos at home to play with.</p> <p>The gossip columnists sunk their canines into the incident. The scarlet Kabbala string on Kimora's wrist, the one 'blessed by the matriarch Rachel - she's long dead, like in a tomb somewhere', had again failed to protect her.</p> <p>'You gotta get tough,' Russell told his wife. She had gone to such trouble - for him! - to measure up as an urban fashion icon, a woman who, in her own words, could 'inspire young women to aspire'. But to the New York tabloids, Kimora is an irresistible pin cushion.</p> <p>'Why is everyone worrying about what she spends?' says Russell. 'They should be worried about what Roberto Cavalli spends, too. How many cars does Tommy Hilfiger have, by the way?'</p> <p>'If you are successful, people want to see it,' says Vogue's Talley. 'They want to share in the dream.' Especially people of struggle, as Russell Simmons tactfully calls them. It's one reason rap lyrics sometimes read like shopping lists.</p> <p>However, the auction-room spat has been surpassed on the Kimora scandal meter. In July she was pulled over while driving her Mercedes for 'for minor vehicle violations' and charged with eluding police, careless driving and possession of marijuana under 50g. All of which she denied at an August court appearance. </p> <p>'There was not a bag of drugs in the car,' says her lawyer, Stacey Richman. 'Evidently some item that has some marijuana residue in it was in the car. I don't believe the item belonged to her.' Husband Russell sees the episode as a commercial opportunity. 'Have you seen the mug shot?' he asked. 'It's a nice T-shirt at the end of the day.'</p> <p>In the mugshot Kimora is wearing her Kabala wrist string. Yet again it failed to bring her luck.</p> <p>Long ago, Kimora Lee realised that if she couldn't be the most popular girl in school, it might be fun to be the girl everybody talks about. 'Be happy if people are talking about you,' her father used to say. Only now she's not so sure. The self-styled World's Biggest Collector of Louis Vuitton is trying not to brag these days, but there's just so much to show off. 'I am a fly bitch!' the 29-year-old says, sounding slightly exasperated.</p> <p>'I have this vision of Kimora being the greatest brand in the world,' says Russell, 46. 'There's no woman better. Nobody should put on a Franck Muller diamond-platinum watch before Kimora. You have some girl who's a rapper who came from the block? It ain't the same as Kimora.'</p> <p>Russell started Baby Phat in 1999, the year after he married Kimora, recognising his bride's potential as a champion of the multi-ethnic woman, an image that could sell a new line of women's and children's clothing to teenagers and clued-in young mums. Under the ex-model's supervision, Baby Phat fashion shows were like rock concerts, promoting the entire Phat family. Runway collections were created in three weeks: editors chuckled at the visible safety pins and the fur stoles camouflaging hurried finishing on spring 2004's Josephine Baker showgirls, but none of that stuff was ever meant for upscale department stores. The big business is in the jeans, the T-shirts, the copycat Vuitton-like bags, graffitied with the BP logo.</p> <p>The Times Square billboard will be one of the first sightings of Kimora Lee: The Brand. The newly formed Simmons Jewelry Company is inventing a Kimora-cut diamond. Talks are intensifying to get Kimora her own Baby Phat Barbie, a line of MAC cosmetics, a Coty perfume.</p> <p>The fashion company is but one sliver of Kimora's portfolio. Hollywood has been on line one ever since she was a judge on Tyra Banks's hit TV show America's Next Top Model. And a talk show, Life &amp; Style, is arriving at the same time this autumn as her role as a basketball player's ex in Beauty Shop, MGM's Barbershop spin-off.</p> <p>'I loved the whole experience, and I want to do more of it!' says Kimora. 'Damn! She's basketball tall,' the film crew marvelled whenever she stepped out of her trailer, 6ft 4in in heels, her three dogs yap-yap-yapping, a huge birthday bouquet from her husband outside with the remains of an ice sculpture of her bitch-goddess self. Russell flew a poet in to recite some birthday verse: '27 Again', the title teased.</p> <p>Russell was ambivalent about her doing the movie. He doesn't know if he wants everyone in the world to know just how crazy and funny and silly Kimora can be. 'There's a lot of stuff Russell wishes I wouldn't do,' Kimora acknowledges.</p> <p>At parties, if Russell is working the room, Kimora gets restless. 'Whenever you're ready,' she says loudly. Russell cocktail-parties with Mayor Bloomberg, Martha Stewart, Ron Perelman. Sounding at times like a man planning a run for office, he's been vocal about public education, drug-law reform and voter registration, and he gives almost $1m a year to charity. </p> <p>Russell and Kimora have a unique relationship in hip-hop culture, says Talley: 'She's not behind him, she's on the side of him, and sometimes she's in front of him.' But even though Kimora scored $20m of her own from the Phat fashion sale, it's Russell who is sitting in the director's chair, Russell who just took her to England to meet Prince Charles.</p> <p>'There's a difference between a rapper talking about a luxury brand and someone who really has the ability to establish one,' says Russell. 'I want people to know Kimora's history.'</p> <p>It's a history that could have been written by Danielle Steel. Ten minutes after her warm hello, Kimora casually drops that she had an exclusive contract modelling for Chanel at the age of 13. Russell likes to say she lived with Karl Lagerfeld.</p> <p>Already, one detects the myth-making. In 1989, shortly after the 14th candle was snuffed out on Kimora Perkins's cake, a scout in St Louis put her on a plane to Paris. Lagerfeld had just broken up with his muse of six years, Ines de la Fressange. In strode Kimora, late of Dillard's department store in the Galleria shopping mall. Lagerfeld repackaged her as a bejewelled child bride with a big-bowed hat for Chanel's haute-couture grand finale.</p> <p>'This girl represents the Nineties!' he told reporters. 'She has human proportions!' When CNN's fashion correspondent asked where she was from, Lagerfeld professed ignorance. W magazine guessed she was Hawaiian.</p> <p>'We always felt that Karl had kind of used Kimora to flaunt in Ines's face,' says Kimora's St Louis agent, Delcia Corlew. 'You know, a sort of, \"Here's this young girl who's taking your place.\"'</p> <p>'I was 13! I was certainly the youngest face. I was certainly the most different face that had ever been the bride or the muse,' says Kimora. In her adolescent mind, she believed that Lagerfeld, a confirmed bachelor, wanted to marry Ines. But Lagerfeld was dallying with others, too: Bernadette Jurkowski, Shoshanna Fitzgerald and Olga Sobolewska. Women's Wear Daily labelled all four 'the Karlettes'. 'Olga was the only one on contract, and Olga's name wasn't really even Olga,' Shoshanna remembers. 'Karl just didn't like her real name.'</p> <p>Kimora was speedily indoctrinated in the ways of fantasy. But making friends was difficult because there were no other children skipping around 31 rue Cambon. She was soon pirouetting through the local McDonald's in Chanel's signature silk ballerina shoes, cardigan and 'camellia bows out of the yin-yang,' she says. Staff at the fashion house joked that Kimora had become 'Mademoiselle Chanel'.</p> <p>'She wanted a Porsche, she wanted a Mercedes, I knew that about her,' says Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, who was introduced to her at the time.</p> <p>Lagerfeld himself was proficient in the art of high maintenance, says Kimora: 'I remember his house on rue de l'Universit\u00e9. It was like, hoist the piano through the window. Hoist the 10-ton marble sculpture up the six flights of stairs.'</p> <p>But Kimora only worked two seasons for Chanel, says her second agent, Bethann Hardison. 'It was a novelty for Karl, a moment,' says Hardison flatly. 'She talks about it a lot because it's chic to talk about.' Kimora adds: 'You know how Russell will say, \"My wife has travelled all over the world and she speaks these different languages and she taught me what fork to pick up?\" Well, Karl taught me which fork to pick up. Andtospeakveryquickly.'</p> <p>Whereas other models could be frosty, Kimora radiated a sunny familiarity as she was fussed over at fittings. But Kimora was always in the fridge or running up a scandalous phone bill, and Lagerfeld's patience was not elastic. 'She got on people's nerves,' says Hardison. 'The child was ostentatious.'</p> <p>'It's a wonderful thing I've created with you,' Lagerfeld told her, 'but now you're a $5,000-tote-bag-wearing monster, and for that, I am sorry.' Kimora requested Tyra Banks as her roommate in one model apartment. 'She always had the new Prada bag and would laugh at me because mine was from Wal-Mart,' says Banks.</p> <p>Careering back and forth between Paris and St Louis, Kimora graduated on time with the help of a coach. Her mother was thinking college and tried to stop Kimora from frittering away her tiny fortune. But at the age of 15, she'd bought herself a Rolex and a second-hand BMW convertible, before she even had a driver's licence. Accidents ensued. Some girls spray-painted the car. Other Dillard's models hissed about the Pomeranian now poking out of Kimora's Louis Vuitton holdall. </p> <p>Kimora Lee's father, she says, was the first black deputy federal marshal in St Louis. The rest of the story is generally redacted. He was out of the picture before his daughter was born. Like his daughter, Vernon Whitlock Jr distinguished himself early: graduating at the top of his police academy class in St Louis, he was recruited by the federal marshals in 1962. He told people he marched with Reverend Martin Luther King Jr from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. After 10 years, Whitlock quit to be an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigator; the money was better, and it got even better when he became a bail bondsman in the late Seventies. But he was such a superfly, with his flashy cars and clothes and diamond-chip rings, and such a braggart - trading bonds for jewellery or sex with inmates' girlfriends, court papers alleged, and dealing cocaine and synthetic heroin - that in 1985, he was targeted by several law enforcement agencies.</p> <p>Sentenced to 24 years when Kimora was in primary school, Whitlock was sprung after just three: he swaggered into the local marshal's office and told ex-colleagues he'd turned state's evidence against his supplier. Now a barber, Whitlock was a guest at Kimora's St Barts wedding and captured the ceremony on video, which he screens for customers at his shop.</p> <p>Her mother's story is very Joy Luck Club, Kimora says. Joanne Perkins was born into the chaos of the Korean War and later adopted by an American serviceman who had spotted her mother filling sandbags in Inchon. Joanne maintains that her 'full-blooded Japanese' mother went to Korea from Kyoto as a refugee during the Second World War, though this would make her a historical anomaly. There were few, if any, refugees from Kyoto, since it was never bombed, and those who left for Korea at the war's end were invariably ethnic Koreans who were being repatriated.</p> <p>Joanne Perkins worked as an administrator for Social Security and has retired to a house in East Hampton that Kimora bought for her. Perkins now calls herself by her mother's name, Kyoko, baffling longtime acquaintances. For Kimora, the link to her Japanese heritage represents another marketing opportunity. 'I cannot wait to get Kimora on a plane and take her to Japan,' says Russell, 'because I know they're going to go crazy.' 'I consider myself to be one of the black women in fashion who made it,' she says. 'But black women don't look at me like that.'</p> <p>'A number of them probably think Russell should be married to a black woman,' says Emil Wilbekin, editorial director of Vibe magazine. And in negotiations for TV shows and movies, race remains an issue: is Kimora Lee Simmons black enough?</p> <p>Kimora was 17 when Russell Simmons, who grew up in Queens, spotted her on the catwalk. Russell's girlfriends looked like they'd stepped out of a cigarette ad - 'But with Def Jam's success, he got a crack at a different grade of model,' says a hip-hop executive who's known him for years. 'In Russell's mind, he's always trading up.' Russell sent ridiculous flowers to Kimora's agency, so heavy that two men were required to move them. 'I thought that was major,' Kimora remembers. 'I told Tyra.' Banks replied: 'I can imagine what they look like, because he sent me some, too.' Tyra told Kimora to get rid of him.</p> <p>Kimora's bookings would soon fall off - people complained she was a brat - but Russell's interest did not flag. 'I was kind of more on his level,' says Kimora. They were on and off for years. 'He was a playboy, and I am a bit crazy because of it today,' says Kimora. She eventually fled to Milan to escape the insanity. After a year, Russell begged Kimora's mother for her phone number. Yoga and veganism had chased away the partying and the other women. Kimora moved into Russell's house in Beverly Hills and took courses at UCLA. According to friends, Russell is happier and more stable since Kimora arrived in his life for good. 'Kimora's very flamboyant and Russell tries not to be,' says Donald Trump, 'but in many respects, they're the same.'</p> <p>Russell is quick to point out his Timex to a reporter, but he is a yogi with Brahmin tastes. Russell often quotes his rapper brother, the Reverend Run - 'You can't help the poor if you're one of them.' </p> <p>Kimora shuffles downstairs wearing her FUCK FAME T-shirt, rocks flashing like high beams on both hands. With 10 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms, the house in Saddle River, New Jersey, is way bigger than the one in East Hampton. 'It's actually two or three houses deep,' says Kimora. 'You're like Alice in Wonderland in here - and I'm not saying this in a bragging way.' </p> <p>Such a great big space required lots of filling. First, there's Russell's art, a rare Dalai Lama face mask, some Bleckners, a Clemente here, a Warhol/Basquiat collaboration there. And Kimora's innumerable objets: Faberg\u00e9 eggs ('All from Czar whomever - Nicholas! I mean, what he gave to his czarina, right? They're probably not original - see! Faberg\u00e9 eggs! I love my eggs'), Limoges boxes ('That's the little tag that I want to rip off, but my mother would tell me not to').</p> <p>After Gianni Versace died, Kimora practically showed up at Sotheby's with a removal van. 'This is actually Versace's china. His very own that he ate off,' she said with liturgical solemnity. 'This is His own personal bed from His personal bedroom. His mattress. You go figure it out.'</p> <p>Versace was one of the few designers who could actually create a supermodel, but he didn't think Kimora was sexy. 'Kimora's such a baby!' he used to say, which made her glum because she preferred his extravagant stylings. Now Kimora's older daughter, Ming, four, is jumping up and down on His satin-duchesse bedspread, on His $20,000 mahogany lit d'alcove.</p> <p>'No respect for the Versace bed,' Kimora says calmly. 'There is nothing in here that a kid can't touch.' When she was growing up, her white stepmother had a white sofa. And she would say: 'You're gonna get it if you don't get out of my living room.' There are no white sofas here. Or white pets. 'Who's even this colour in this house?' she shouted to her assistant, spotting some fuzz on a tufted ottoman. 'All my animals are black!'</p> <p>Kimora collects dogs with names like Beluga. Miyake is a cat that showed up on her doorstep, 'so calm and sweet, like the people in Saddle River,' she said. 'But I have another one, Midnight, from the ghettos of Seattle. He's long and wiry and crazy. He'll knock stuff over,' she said admiringly.</p> <p>In a recent magazine campaign, Kimora was photographed in her mansion as a you-can't-touch-this chatelaine attended by an array of servants. It got people's attention. 'The message is: I'm rich and you're not,' says Robin Givhan, The Washington Post's fashion critic. 'I found the ads offensive. It's a very calculated \"look at all the stuff I have\", with the domestics, and the kids are just another possession.'</p> <p>But plenty of designers have starred in their own ads, including Calvin, Giorgio, Donna, Donatella and Ralph. 'It makes people feel like they're more a part of your life,' said Kimora. 'And my life is so crazy and so over-the-top, a True Hollywood Story, except without being tragic.'</p> <p>Daughter Aoki doesn't want to take a bath, and Kimora swings the 18-month-old up on her hip. 'Really, it's hard being a teenage mother. That's why they say you should wait until you're old enough, and maybe I wasn't old enough for you two,' Kimora says playfully. 'When they get older, I may get a tutor on the road.' She won't separate from her children, she says, and if she's gone for any length of time, the animals hop on the Gulfstream, too.</p> <p>Aoki's tears turned into long sighs. Kimora is friendly with half-Japanese model Devon Aoki, who landed enviable contracts with Chanel and Versace. Kimora not only hired her for a Baby Phat ad campaign, she also snatched her manager. 'But I didn't name my daughter after her,' Kimora said, 'though maybe subliminally, subconsciously it happened.' Kimora headed into her favourite room, a walk-in closet with CCTV cameras ogling shoes like jewel-encrusted barges. A man appears, Kimora's queer eye, she says. 'These are Giuseppe Zanotti,' he says, grabbing a pair of pumps, 'and she had these before Beyonc\u00e9 did in her video.' Kimora considers the fistfuls of jewellery locked up in the safe, and how she was always buying these gifts for herself. Russell just wasn't that kind of guy, she says. She looks sad.</p> <p>An SUV grumbles to a halt outside, and Russell Simmons climbs out. 'Hi, hubby!' He's fasting, penance for paella eaten on holiday with the guys. He goes to grab several baby bottles filled with scary-looking green stuff out of the fridge. She can't imagine how anyone can drink that stuff, even if it is in a Tiffany glass.</p> <p>The S on the Neverlandish gates outside stands for samadhi, a state of blissful union. 'The whole thing about living in a house like this,' says Kimora, 'is being able to share it with your family. Have tonnes of kids! Have tonnes of animals!' A giant topiary giraffe at the end of her driveway is the last thing Kimora sees when she heads out into the world. And it will never disappear from her rear-view mirror.</p>",
  "<p>You've got to love it when men start whingeing about women not 'allowing' them to be men. Bob Geldof did it only this week during a rant about the breakdown of marriage. Geldof believes that the fact women initiate 70 per cent of divorces does not mean that men don't understand women, but rather that women don't understand men. And that instead of trying to get them to change, we should accept them as they are. 'If girls don't like masculine characteristics, then it's too bad, because 50 per cent of the planet is men,' says Geldof, adding: 'Men don't feel the need to talk in general, to articulate what it is they are. I feel no need to talk. Men and women are very different, and we have always been very different. That is precisely why we find each other so attractive.' </p> <p>Dispensing swiftly with the puzzling image of Geldof as someone who 'feels no need to talk', one's thoughts turn to men displaying 'masculine characteristics', which wouldn't necessarily involve a trip to the pub with a tenner stolen from your purse: all I could come up with up was Steve McQueen looking beautiful and damned in a tight T-shirt sitting astride a motorcycle, which probably says more about me than it does about masculinity. Still, it seemed significant that I had to turn to Hollywood, the land of fantasy and wish fulfilment, for elucidation on the essence of machismo. That's what I'd like to ask Mr Geldof: where are all these men who want to be men? Where are these guys being held back by dreadful harpies who won't stand for any 'masculine characteristics'? It seems more and more that it's men who aren't allowing themselves to be men - they prefer to sit around moaning about their lives like a bunch of hairy, whingeing girls. </p> <p>I'm not trying to claim there aren't women out there who'd do anything to stop the practice of 'Men Enjoying Themselves Without Them'. Come on, girls, we all do it. However much we try to suppress it, it drives us crazy when we get wind of our men 'escaping' from us, if only for a few hours, into some (usually beery, sporty, mega-hetero) enclave where we just can't get at them, however much we nag and sulk. This attitude was perfectly illustrated by the news that the 'feminised' BBC wants to axe the sports show They Think It's All Over for being 'laddish' and 'outdated'. I'm sorry, but men sitting around talking pointlessly about sport and cracking childish jokes will never be outdated. You might as well say men are outdated. You could definitely say that, once again, women are ganging up to try to stop men openly enjoying sport. On this level alone, women have become slightly unreasonable (you don't see men opining on the disgraceful 'anachronism' of women enjoying fashion). On every other level, men have got it wrong. We are not against 'masculine characteristics' per se. How can we be, when we rarely ever see any? </p> <p>Here's a little secret: on the whole, women rather like masculine men. We would love them to take control sometimes, know their own minds, walk around occasionally with drills, grapple with balaclava'd muggers and stuff like that. So, where are you all? Bring it on, come into our lives so we can see if we dig you or not; don't be strangers. Instead, there seems to be an awful lot of a new kind of man, dripping around whining that no one's taking care of him properly, life's really hard, he's disenfranchised, women are meanies, boo hoo. At the same time, the surely not insignificant point that women - those appalling ballbreakers, those annihilators of male pride - work just as hard as men these days, thereby sharing and easing the financial burden, gets completely overlooked. It seems to say something that after the eventual disintegration of the relationship, some of these whingeing girl-men spend all their time gallivanting on top of public buildings complaining about not seeing enough of their children instead of (natch) seeing their children. Is this what passes for manly behaviour these days? Is this Whingeing Girlie dressed as Batman thing the best you guys have got? </p> <p>With modern life being the way it is, maybe it's sad but not so surprising that the genders have gone into 'manly woman/girly man' meltdown. And that our differences, the things that Geldof rightly says make us intriguing to each other, are shrinking away with evolution like psychosexual appendixes. The thing to remember is that it's not all one-way traffic. Just as there's the standard moan about women turning into men, it seems that some men are turning into women at an alarming rate, and not even particularly nice women; whingeing, nagging cry-babies, in fact. So yes, Mr Geldof, women shouldn't try to change men, but maybe it's more the case that they're trying to change them back. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

The burned-out, alcoholic Creasy (Denzel Washington) goes there to act as bodyguard to Pita (Dakota Fanning), the 10-year-old daughter of a rich Mexican businessman and his blonde American wife (Radha Mitchell). He's a former assassin for the US government's counter-insurgency division and in search of redemption. </p> <p>'Do you think God will forgive us for what we've done?' he asks his old CIA chum, Christopher Walken. After reluctantly bonding with his young charge, Creasy is nearly killed when she's kidnapped and drags himself from his bed to go on a rampage, torturing and killing anyone associated with the abduction. </p> <p>Adapted by Brian Helgeland from a 1980 novel set in Italy, the movie has been switched to Mexico City because it's now the world capital of kidnapping for profit (though Baghdad probably holds the title pro tem ) and the place is presented as a polluted hell, rotten to the core. </p> <p>Only an honest middle-aged cop and a crusading journalist stand up to the universal corruption and they unite in helping to unleash Creasy. It's an exciting tale, roughly an hour too long, and marred as always by Scott's self-conscious artiness, a legacy of days shooting commercials. There's slow motion, fast motion, hectic editing, pounding music and even the sub-titles are designed to jump up and hit you between the eyes. Denzel Washington is his commanding, jaw-clenching self and Dakota Fanning (whose name sounds to me like a Midwest company manufacturing air-conditioners) shows once again that she's the most accomplished child actor at work today. </p> <p>The film I most enjoyed last week, <strong> Bright Leaves</strong>, is a rambling highly personal essay in which Ross McElwee, the Boston-based documentarist, returns to his native North Carolina to meet friends and relatives and look into the state's tobacco industry in which his great-grandfather played a major role in the years after the Civil War. </p> <p>Apparently the nineteenth-century McElwee developed the weed known as Bull Durham and started manufacturing cigarettes by machine but was destroyed by his rival, the autocratic bully James Buchanan Duke, who went on to become one of the world's richest men. If great-grandad had won out, McElwee's family would be rolling in money today, but they'd be steeped in guilt for killing more people through lung cancer and heart disease than died in the Civil War. He also pursues a curious id\u00e9e fixe that the long-forgotten 1951 Warner Brothers melodrama Bright Leaf , starring Gary Cooper and Patri cia Neal, was a fictionalised version of his great-grandfather's life. McElwee is a more congenial companion than Michael Moore and his movie gives self-indulgence a good name. It deserves a wider showing than it's getting. </p> <p>Also about the hypnotic quality of cinema, and one of today's five movies about ghosts and revenants, Tsai Ming-Liang's elegant <strong> Goodbye Dragon Inn</strong> is set on the last night of a large, decaying cinema in, presumably, Taipei. The two-person staff - a male projectionist and a female cashier with a gammy leg - wander round the building but never meet. The film being shown is King Hu's 1966 martial arts classic Dragon Inn and the audience gradually disappears until a mere handful remain, some clearly ghosts. Shot in deep focus with long takes and little camera movement, the movie has only four lines of dialogue. One is 'Do you know this theatre is haunted?'; another is 'Nobody goes to the cinema any more'. You'll love it or hate it. I loved it. </p> <p>The second ghost movie is the latest bizarre South Korean horror flick, <strong> Into the Mirror</strong>, in which a series of strange murders occur in the days leading up to the re-opening of a grand department store in Seoul. A young homicide detective suspects that a serial killer is on the rampage; a former senior colleague of his, now working as the shop's head of security, believes that a vengeful ghost, operating through the endless mirrors, is a possible culprit. It's a very clever film about mirrors and mirror images that Lewis Carroll and Jean Cocteau would have loved. Among the clues is a National Gallery postcard of Jan van Eyck's The Arnolfini Marriage, with its mysterious convex mirror. </p> <p>Jacques Rivette, 76, the least known and most cultish of the Nouvelle Vague directors, is noted for the length, obscurity and infrequency of his pictures, though his latest, <strong> Histoire de Marie et Julien</strong>, was made only two years after his previous one, lasts a mere 150 minutes and tells a seemingly straightforward love story. As with Tony Scott and Man on Fire, this picture has been on Rivette's mind for 27 years and he originally intended Albert Finney and Leslie Caron to play the Parisian clockmaker and the enigmatic beauty who enters his life. The roles are now taken by Jerzy Radziwilowicz and Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, the heroine of Rivette's last really good movie, La Belle Noiseuse. The film has echoes of Hitchcock's Vertigo and Cocteau's Orph\u00e9e and turns on the commonplace notion that the dead remain with us until their work on earth has been discharged. For a picture about the fantastic and supernatural, it's a surprisingly flat and unmagical affair. </p> <p>The ghost in<strong> Bubba Ho-tep</strong> is a malevolent Egyptian mummy conjured up from somewhere to wreak havoc in a dismal convalescent home in Mud Creek, Texas, where he's challenged by an elderly black patient who believes himself to be Jack Kennedy and a wrinkled old man with a Zimmer frame who is either an Elvis Presley impersonator or the King himself. Depending on how that description strikes you, it's neither as good nor bad as it sounds. </p> <p>In the terrible <strong> Resident Evil: Apocalypse</strong>, based on a best-selling video game, the ghosts are undead cannibals, released from the underground laboratories of a crazy biotech corporation to lay waste a place called Raccoon City. It's morgue-standard 'Dawn of the Dead' stuff, as unnecessary a sequel as ever got made. </p> <p>Finally, two movies about love by women writer-directors. Set in smart bohemian-academic-professional Dublin, Liz Gill's <strong> Goldfish Memory</strong> takes its title from the chat-up line a womanising university lecturer uses on his girl pupils. He compares the three-second memory of a goldfish to the transience of love. It's a thin, likable Irish variation on La Ronde , though less an amorous roundabout than a M\u00f6bius strip for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and straights, who are favoured by the director in that descending order. </p> <p>Clare Peploe's <strong> The Triumph of Love</strong>, more formally philosophical on matters of mind and heart, is an adaptation of an early 18th-century Marivaux commedia dell'arte comedy. A princess (Mira Sorvino) and her servant dress in men's clothes to stir up a detached philosopher (Ben Kingsley) and his spinster sister (Fiona Shaw) as a means of winning over the thinker's handsome ward. The cross-dressed Sorvino is lovely, but the play doesn't work on screen. It's a little like Twelfth Night , but more like a month of Sundays.</p>",
  "<b> Humanist values </b> <br> I agree with Mary Riddell (Comment, last week) on the case of Charlotte Wyatt, except in one respect. It is not my observation that 'humanists risk prizing survival at all costs'. In fact, on voluntary euthanasia, abortion and other medical ethical problems, we usually argue on reason and compassion for quality of life to be vital in decision-making. We often find ourselves opposing those who argue on religious grounds. <b>Marilyn Mason, Education Officer</b> <br> British Humanist Association <br> London WC1 <p><b>Not so sweet</b><br> Your health correspondent's disclosure of the confidential briefing document, designed to undo the World Health Organisation's attack on 'globesity', provides a compelling aide-m\u00e9moire, not only on the World Sugar Research Organisation that drafted it, but on the politics and power of a far too much taken for granted, 'pimp' commodity (News, last week).

  "Maurice Saatchi, the advertising magnate who is very influential over Tory strategy, has a theory about the British electorate. He expounded it during a rare interview at The Observer's event at the Conservative conference. According to Lord Saatchi, the electorate is like a 'girl' who has had her heart broken by Tony Blair. Having once succumbed to his charms, now she feels betrayed. This is bad news for Mr Blair, but that doesn't necessarily make it good news for rival suitors. <p>Saatchi's 'girl' has become mistrustful of any politician who comes bearing 'boxes of chocolates and bouquets of flowers'. So wounding has been her experience at the hands of the Lothario of Downing Street that she has become suspicious and cynical about the promises of them all. </p> <p>You can see why the Saatchi theory is liked by Michael Howard and his colleagues in the shadow cabinet. It helps to explain why dissatisfaction with the government has not translated into success for the Conservatives. It gives them an excuse not to ask themselves whether their real problem with wooing 'the girl' is that she simply doesn't fancy the Tories. </p> <p>Given that the immediate context of the Conservative conference was a run of poor opinion polls and a humiliating fourth place in the Hartlepool by-election, the Tories had a good week in Bournemouth. They appeared largely united. They unveiled some new policy. Actually, they largely regurgitated a lot of old policy dressed up as new policy. One of the New Labour tricks they are imitating is relentless repetition. The leader delivered a well-received speech. But scratch beneath the surface of the choreography of the Tory conference and you found no serious Conservative expecting to be part of a government on the day after the next election. </p> <p>If Labour is the appalling disaster they kept telling everyone it is, then why are the Conservatives so distant from where they should be if they are going to regain power? </p> <p>Their answer is that the public is deeply disaffected with the entire political class. Trust- the lack of it and how to rebuild it - was the underlying theme of the entire party conference season. </p> <p>Charles Kennedy made the low level of trust in the government the central thrust of his critique of Tony Blair. The Prime Minister openly acknowledged that the 'problem of trust' flowed from 'the decisions I have taken' over Iraq. While attacking Tony Blair over trust, Michael Howard felt his own party's credibility needed the concession that the Tories had made their own contribution to the corrosion of public faith in politics by breaking their promises on tax when they were in government. </p> <p>The leader with the least obvious problem with trust is Mr Kennedy. His personal poll ratings for trustworthiness are high. This has something to do with his undemagogic, straight-talking persona. It probably has at least as much to do with the fact that a Liberal has not been in residence at Number 10 for nearly a century. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy's credibility problem is of a different order: he still has to fight the idea that a vote for the Liberal Democrats will be a wasted vote or a vote marginal to the real contest for power. </p> <p>Tony Blair's trust deficit over Iraq is again thrust to the centre of debate by the barbaric killing of Ken Bigley. Public reaction may well split in broadly the same way as the Bigley family itself has divided. One brother, Paul, accuses the Prime Minister of having 'blood on his hands' from an illegal war. The rest of the family say that they are satisfied that the government did everything it could in an impossible situation. Number 10 will hope that provides the Prime Minister with some insulation from re-ignited attacks on the war and its aftermath. Mr Blair can hope to capture an almost universal mood when he expresses his admiration for the 'extraordinary dignity and courage' of the family and his 'utter revulsion' at the killers' savagery. </p> <p>The Prime Minister's fundamental and continuing trust problem is the way in which he sold the invasion of Iraq on the basis of a threat from weapons of mass destruction which it was definitively announced last week did not exist. The anger about this and the inability to find a way to appease that fury was exemplified by the mauling suffered by Patricia Hewitt at the hands of the BBC's Question Time audience on Thursday night. Whatever she said, and however she put it, the Trade &amp; Industry Secretary was howled at until she finally uttered the word 'sorry'. This was reminiscent of the treatment meted out by TV audiences to ministers in the dying days of the last Tory government. </p> <p>As the politicians grope to address public disaffection, some common approaches were evident at the conferences. One was the attempt by politicians to humanise themselves by demonstrating that they come from the same planet as the rest of us. At a risible level, there was the excruciating video shown at the Tory conference in which frontbenchers were asked about their first kiss and most recent CD purchase. Does anyone seriously think the Tories are going to get a single extra vote because Nicholas Soames claims to like Dido? And is she consulting her lawyers? </p> <p>More effectively, Gordon Brown, a man who has previously flinched from any personal revelation, spoke movingly about how he had been touched by life and death. Michael Howard, who before he became leader was utterly resistant to opening any windows into his background, moved some of his audience to tears when he talked about his grandmother being killed in a concentration camp and owing his own life to Britain. </p> <p>One politician more than any other has pressed his biography into the service of his politics. That is Tony Blair. Interestingly, he seems to think that he has mined this seam to exhaustion. His conference speech was devoid of the emoting that used to be one of the most prominent characteristics of his big rhetorical occasions. </p> <p>He also eschewed much blue skies oratory. His aides tried to make a virtue of the flatness of much of Mr Blair's delivery by saying his speech was deliberately designed to be 'conversational'. He broke one of the cardinal rules of the speech-writers' textbook by giving a wordy and prosaic list of '10 pointers to what a third term Labour government would do'. Where once Mr Blair would offer us pillars and pledges, now it is pointers. The Big Idea is now small ideas. </p> <p>The Conservatives likewise spent their conference week trying to deal with public distrust. Some of this was transparently gimmicky. To make his 'timetable for action' sound more credible, Michael Howard promised to sack any member of his cabinet who failed to come up to scratch. Does that mean Mr Howard would have to fire himself for appointing these failed ministers? The Tories' central pledge on tax cuts was not to make a pledge of tax cuts. </p> <p>'We will only promise what we can deliver,' Michael Howard told us. That could have been Tony Blair in 1997. In fact, it is precisely what Tony Blair said then when he went to the electorate with a limited number of pledges and a modest prospectus designed to make it sound safe to elect Labour. Vote for the politician who promises you least, they say. That way you will be least disappointed. </p> <p>Even as the parties attack each other, they ape each other. Trust us - we don't trust ourselves either. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: a.rawnsley@observer.co.uk\">a.rawnsley@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A year ago, 24 members of the Irish Ramblers Club travelled to South America. Our plan was to cross from Peru to Bolivia but, due to unrest in Bolivia, the border was closed. </p> <p>We had booked flights from La Paz to Lima worth \u00a33,288 and had to cancel them. The Bolivian airline in Cusco said we would get a refund, but had to go through our travel agent, Condor Travel in London, which agreed to process it.</p> <p>Over the next six months, I emailed and phoned on numerous occasions and made three personal visits without avail. Finally I contacted the airline in Barcelona and its head office in La Paz. On 6 July, the airline confirmed that it had sent the cheque to Condor Travel but, two months later, I still have not received the money.<br><strong>FR, Dublin</strong> </p> <p>Condor Travel said it had a cheque - for \u00a32,013 - for you but was waiting for you to confirm how you wanted to receive it - by cheque or direct payment - and that you would accept \u00a32,013 in full and final settlement. The lower amount appears to be due to several currency conversions. You had already provided this information and agreed to accept the lower amount to end the saga. Your cheque has now arrived. </p> <p><strong> So near and yet so Faro</strong> </p> <p> I left my handbag in the hotel when rushing to catch a flight home from Faro airport. We heard that the bag had been handed in by hotel staff but Airtours would not post it to me because it contained valuables, such as my driving licence. My Norwich Union travel insurance will not pay to send it back by courier because the handbag is not lost.<br><strong>KL, Halesworth</strong> </p> <p>Airtours says it has no confirmation your handbag has been found and it does not generally return lost property to Britain. But, if you paid it a \u00a335 search fee and it found the bag, the company would send it back by courier, although you have to pay and the courier it uses will not ship valuables. </p> <p>Norwich Union would pay compensation only if the bag really is lost, and then minus an excess. You cannot claim for the cost of posting it back and, if you believe the bag is safe, cannot say it is lost. Your cheapest option is to pay the hotel to send it with a courier that accepts valuables. </p> <p><strong> Accounting for Abbey's bad habit </strong> </p> <p> I opened an Abbey Isa and wanted to transfer \u00a31,400 from an existing Isa with Principality building society. Abbey's customer helpline said the money was transferred on 29 June. I tried to withdraw \u00a31,200 on 23 July and was told that there were no funds in my account. </p> <p>On 29 July, Abbey said it did have my money but it had not yet been posted to my account. I needed the \u00a31,200 to make a mortgage payment and, because it failed to come through, had to arrange an overdraft.<br><strong>DA, Newport</strong> </p> <p>Abbey says it has taken on more staff and brought in new equipment to clear the backlog which built up in the summer but admits you suffered bad service. It is sending you \u00a350 compensation. </p> <p><strong> Wheel of misfortune</strong> </p> <p> On 6 May, I drove over a huge piece of debris, a stripped lorry tyre, on the M65 which caused \u00a3300- worth of damage to my car. The Highways Agency turned down my claim for the repairs, saying its agents did a sweep once a week which, it assured me, fulfils its responsibility to provide a debris-free highway. But I am \u00a3300 out of pocket.<br><strong>VM, Chorley</strong> </p> <p>Under the Highways Act 1980, highway authorities must keep motorways and strategic trunk roads maintained and safe, but the law also protects them from claims for damages provided they take reasonable measures to comply. The M65 falls in inspection category B, where safety inspections must be carried out no more than once every seven days, although there are daily safety patrols as well. </p> <p>The agent, Atkins, carried out a safety inspection on 5 May and a safety patrol on the morning of 6 May and neither found any debris. It had no report of the tyre until you hit it, so the Highways Agency reckons Atkins fulfilled its obligations, so it will not pay compensation. </p> <p><strong> Can I carry on working? </strong> </p> <p> I work for an organisation that has a compulsory retirement age of 60.

  "<p>Margaret, 55, was a late developer pension-wise and now wants to make up for lost time. She writes:</p> <p>'I left school at 15 and worked in a variety of jobs, none of which involved a pension. </p> <p>In my early twenties I went back to college to get my A-levels and then did a degree in politics and modern history. This meant I was 30 by the time I finished university. </p> <p>After that I did a teaching qualification but by that time I was married. I then had two sons, so I only worked part-time. I didn't get a full-time teaching job until 1992 and only then did I join the pension scheme. </p> <p>Assuming I retire when I am 60, I will have contributed about 17 years to the teachers' pension scheme and 13 years to a FSAVC scheme. I estimate that when I retire these will provide me with a pension of about \u00a34,200 a year. I am not sure what state pension I am entitled to and whether it would be advantageous to buy back any of the years I have missed. </p> <p>My eldest son, who is 19, has just started his second year at university and my younger is 17 and still at school, so he still has about four years further education to complete. </p> <p>My husband is a self-employed chartered surveyor and has a personal pension, but this has gone down considerably in value in recent years. </p> <p>We have a repayment mortgage of \u00a325,000 which will be paid off in seven years' time, but we have no other debts. </p> <p>We have about \u00a350,000 invested in shares, such as the privatisations and demutualisations. I also have \u00a314,500 invested in premium bonds on behalf of my two sons. </p> <p>I currently save \u00a3100 a month in a building society to pay for things such as holidays. I estimate I could save another \u00a3250 or so towards my pension. </p> <p>Should I buy added years, or would it be better to buy a cottage in the country which would appreciate in value as our own home has done? </p> <p>We wouldn't let this out: it would be for our own enjoyment.'</p> <p><strong>You will have more money than you think</strong></p> <p>Many middle-aged women find themselves in a similar position to yours. Pensions were not a priority when they were young and even if they did pay into one, they would usually take a refund of contributions when they moved jobs or stopped work to start a family. Cash in hand seemed more important at the time. Many now regret those decisions as they near retirement and have little pension to look forward to. </p> <p>With regard to your state pension, you may not be in as bad a position as you think, says Robert Reid of independent financial advisers Syndaxi. During the years when you were working part-time looking after your children, you will probably have qualified for home responsibilities protection (HRP). This reduces the number of years of National Insurance contributions you need to qualify for the basic state retirement pension.</p> <p>HRP has been available since April 1978 and is given automatically to anyone receiving child benefit for a child under 16, although Reid says problems can arise if the child benefit has been credited to the father's bank account rather than the mother's.</p> <p>The best way to find out how much state pension you can expect is to request a state pension forecast from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) on 0845 300 0168. The staff will fill in your application over the phone. Alternatively, get form BR19 from your local DWP office or the internet and send in a written request. Unfortunately, if you have gaps in your contribution record dating from your twenties you will not be able to rectify them as there is a time limit of six years for making good missing contributions.</p> <p>Buying added years to boost your teachers' pension is a sensible idea, says Clive Down, retirement specialist at financial adviser Pendleton May. The huge advantage is that you will know exactly how much extra pension you will get for your money and that it will be index-linked. Added years are even more attractive if your salary rises or you get another promotion as your pension will rise automatically in line. The drawback may be the high cost.</p> <p>The alternatives are making extra AVCs (additional voluntary contributions) or contributing to a stakeholder pension. But Robert Reid says you should first look into your existing FSAVC scheme: 'It is important for Margaret to check the charges and the type of fund she is paying into so she can see whether they are still appropriate.' If the charges are over 1 per cent per annum you would be better off transferring to a cheaper stakeholder pension. If you are planning to retire at 60 you should consider moving your pension savings into the safer environment of a cash or fixed-interest fund if they are not there already.</p> <p>Reid believes you should be considering a similar course of action with your share portfolio, especially as you appear to be uncomfortable with stock market investments. He suggests: 'Why not sell the shares and switch the mortgage to an offset arrangement with a lender such as Intelligent Finance, putting the proceeds of the shares into an allied savings account. Your savings would be in a secure environment, reducing the interest on your mortgage, and you would be able to pay off your mortgage quicker.' The interest you would have earned on your savings goes toward clearing your loan but you still have access to your savings.</p> <p>He also urges you to encourage your husband to see a financial adviser about his pension.</p> <p>Buying another property as a pension top-up would be risky, especially in the current climate, says Clive Down: 'Although property has risen spectacularly over the past few years, it looks as though the market has slowed down.'</p> <p>He suggests investing in a commercial property fund through a stakeholder pension. The attraction of commercial property is that it benefits from a good rental return as well as being a relatively stable investment. At the same time, by investing through a pension you will get income tax relief on your contributions, which will boost your returns.</p> <p>Stakeholder pensions which offer a commercial property fund option include Legal and General, Scottish Widows and Standard Life. At present if you earn less than \u00a330,000 a year you can contribute up to \u00a3234 net per month to a stakeholder pension, or \u00a3300 gross. After April 2006, most people will be able to contribute up to a limit of 100 per cent of their salary to any pension of their choice.</p> <p>And don't forget to use your cash Isa allowance for your building society savings. That way you won't have to pay any tax on the interest.</p> <p><strong>Margaret's to-do list</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Ask for a state pension forecast from the DWP. </p> <p><strong>2. </strong>Ask your employer about the cost of buying added years.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Check the charges on your FSAVC policy and the fund in which your contributions are currently invested. You may need to switch to a cheaper stakeholder plan or transfer your money to a more secure fund.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Consider selling your shares and using the money to offset your mortgage.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Encourage your husband to consult a financial adviser about his pension.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> Think twice about buying another residential property.

  "<p>Bashing the pharmaceutical companies has long been a popular pastime: they are greedy, come up with products with nasty side effects, rush out medicines without conducting sufficient research and their overpaid executives make arrogant, patronising remarks. In Britain, many of us remember the thalidomide scandal, which has coloured many people's views about drugs companies to this day. </p> <p>But while not wishing to gloss over their failings, it is as well to take a reality check - because these are not organisations that make atomic bombs, nerve gas or even cigarettes. Believe it or not, drugs companies, for the most part, sell medicines that make people feel better. Drugs have been developed that have slowed down the advance of Aids, while the discovery of antibiotics means that simple infections are no longer life-threatening diseases. </p> <p>Standards of medicine in western Europe and North America are the envy of the world; it is no coincidence that these are areas where the free enterprise system has had most time to evolve, giving the pharmaceuticals companies the freedom and incentives to come up with new products. </p> <p>But freedom is a double-edged sword and patient groups are now becoming increasingly militant - especially in the States, where the drugs giants face multi-billion-dollar lawsuits for promoting medicines with allegedly harmful side effects. As a result, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are anxious to protect their backs, and that means the pharma firms will find it increasingly difficult to bring new drugs to market. </p> <p>Last week, the sector was rocked by news that Merck was pulling one of its best-selling arthritis drugs after it emerged that the treatment may have caused up to 7,000 fatal heart attacks. Other companies have faced similar problems, while AstraZeneca, Britain's number two drugs firm, has warned of increased regulatory risks. </p> <p>All this comes amid intense government efforts to force down the price of medicines as public healthcare costs spiral out of control. No wonder that the world's biggest drugs companies saw \u00a333 billion wiped off their share prices last week as investors got the message that the days of easy money have probably gone forever. </p> <p>It will be no bad thing if pharmaceutical safety standards are improved, but not if innovation is stifled by red tape. What the industry does need to do, however, is improve its public image. </p> <p>That could start in Africa: making it difficult for people in impoverished countries to acquire cheap drugs to combat Aids is hardly the best way to win hearts and minds.</p> <p><strong>Broken promises leave nasty taste at Standard</strong></p> <p>We know about politicians who break their promises, now we have something similar in the financial services industry. </p> <p>Standard Life has reneged on a promise made four years ago to bail out mortgage endowment holders facing shortfalls. Except Standard Life has been rather more careful than our politicians. For those who bothered to read the small print of the mutual life insurer's promise in 2000, they would have found it littered with caveats. That is why there will be no lawyers, no legal action, no policyholder action groups.</p> <p>Iain Lumsden and Scott Bell, the former bosses at Standard, made it clear that the shortfalls would only be met under certain conditions. One of those conditions was that Standard's with-profits fund returned annual increases of at least 6 per cent a year. By 2002, it was 20 per cent down. At that point, the responsible thing for Lumsden and his directors to have done would have been to admit to policyholders that things were not going well. But they did the opposite, insisting at one point that the bear market was over, and stuffing the fund with equity investments when others were being more cautious.</p> <p>But right up until 2003, when the Financial Services Authority made Standard admit that its solvency ratios were not all that they were cracked up to be, the directors carried on pretending that everything was dandy. They committed the same errors as America's day traders during the tech boom - assuming that stock markets always go up, give or take the odd hiccup.</p> <p>But Sandie Crombie, Standard's new boss, cannot afford to take the risks taken by his predecessors. He has confessed that top-ups for underperforming endowments cannot be met in full. And Crombie has reduced the equities component of the with-profits fund to just 35 per cent, reflecting a more sensible approach.</p> <p>However, the sad fact remains that if Standard had acted earlier to warn endowment policyholders of the clouds on the horizon, they would have had more time to make alternative arrangements. Their interests have not been well served; and now Standard must prepare for a flotation in 2006 in order to replenish its capital base - a rescue rights issue in all but name. It leaves a nasty taste in the mouth.</p> <p><strong>A dig too far for Rupert</strong></p> <p>When a company falls out of favour with investors, it is customary for the incumbent board to blame former managers for screwing things up. And so it was last week, when Rupert Murdoch, chairman of BSkyB, took a swipe at ex-CEO Tony Ball for 'turning down promotional efforts and turning up the price too much'. </p> <p>Murdoch was talking to a conference in New York about the company's new strategy of investing in marketing, new studios and infrastructure - a project that is costing millions more than shareholders had realised. As a result, BSkyB's shares have dived. Of course, the short-termists in the Square Mile are incapable of understanding that BSkyB needs to invest to stay ahead of the game, so all sympathy to Murdoch for outlining the new plan. But laying into Ball is a bit rich, and sits uncomfortably with Murdoch's statement last year, in which he said: 'Tony has shown himself to be one of the most outstanding businessmen in Britain. I am confident that [we] will continue to deliver fantastic results.'</p> <p>Well, not yet. BSkyB's shares were trading at 639p when Ball said he was resigning last autumn; now they are languishing at close to 500p. Somewhere along the line, BSkyB took a wrong turn. But are we really to believe that the man responsible was Ball, one of the finest businessmen this country has seen? Ahem.</p>",
  "<p>The great Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath once noted that cricket was a straightforward game that people were constantly trying to complicate. 'The hardest part,' he said, 'is keeping it simple.' </p> <p>The same is true of management. Not that management is any easier than getting your bat near, or yourself out of the way of, a 95mph ball. It's not. But keeping sight of the context is just as hard as laying bat on ball. </p> <p>Do you hook the bouncer or not? That requires a simultaneous evaluation of the condition of the pitch, the balance of the battle between bowler and batsman and the state of the entire game. </p> <p>Most management is a vast superstructure of complication erected on a small, simple base: the requirement to deliver a product or service to a customer at a satisfactory quality and price. But the superstructure is now so overgrown that it's almost impossible to see the true context. </p> <p>When you get down to it, 95 per cent of 'management' is about managing complexity and 5 per cent about doing the simple things that really matter. </p> <p>Hence the feeling of infinite regression so characteristic of the field: managers pounce eagerly on the latest dragon-taming device (usually IT), only to find that the 'solution' is as frustratingly distant as ever. </p> <p>The answer wasn't IT after all. But nor is it marketing, strategy, HR or any other single element. It's to stop obsessively 'doing the wrong thing righter' (Russell Ackoff) and strip the organisation back to the original simple idea. </p> <p>Think of simplicity as a strong force whose unifying principle is 'pull'. This is in relation to its opposite, the weak force of complexity whose governing principle is 'push'. Both are self-reinforcing spirals but traditional, complexity-based push management drives a vicious circle. </p> <p>Most companies make a product or service and then sell it to the customer with a big sales push. </p> <p>Because they're manufacturing a guess of what the customer wants, they have lots of product variants in reserve 'just in case'. This inventory now has to be stored and managed. </p> <p>As well as IT to track their inventory, companies need computers, specialists and managers to predict demand, order materials and parts and schedule manufacturing for the products they guess the customers will buy. </p> <p>When companies guess wrongly they must dream up incentives for both their salesforce and customers to get these expensively made and stored mistakes sold. These schemes often cancel out any profit and forced sales also obscure what customers really want. </p> <p>Push is so ingrained that we don't notice it any more. Internally rather than externally mandated, it requires forced circulation through the system. Decisions (guesses) and commands about customers, products and quantities are pushed down from the departments where they are made. Communications departments are set up to circulate the information. </p> <p>Jobs are pushed too, their shape determined by computer-derived abstractions that drive (another significant word) production. </p> <p>So is much of the training on offer but, as psychologist Abraham Maslow put it, 'A job that isn't worth doing isn't worth doing well.' These jobs aren't worth doing well and people know it. So to smooth their edges and cajole performance, managers resort to incentives, palliatives and sanctions, administered by an army of human resources executives. </p> <p>Now reverse the logic. Suppose the customer pulls the product or service required through your system. Because you're making what someone has actually ordered, you don't have to guess or predict sales and production. You don't have to add extra features or colours to tempt people to buy. If you're not making things on spec, you don't need the space, computers or people to store and track the inventory. </p> <p>Within the factory, computers for complex scheduling and ordering are redundant because the work itself carries the necessary information. The order automatically triggers demand for parts; the work triggers the next stage in the process. So jobs also have a clear and present focus: to do just what is needed to satisfy the next internal customer. </p> <p>Because the information is validated by the customer and inherent in the work, companies need fewer managers to second-guess it or make arbitrary decisions and then correct them. Managers' jobs change from giving orders to helping others do the job of satisfying customers. </p> <p>Another of Maslow's sayings was: 'If you want people to do a good job, give them a good job to do.' People doing a good job don't take sickies, so firms working this way can do without absenteeism measures (absurd and disastrous bribes for people to turn up to work), nor do you need complicated incentives or other sanctions. Pull easily defines appropriate training, information and pay: whatever it takes to enable people to do a better job of satisfying the cus tomer. Decades ago, author and consultant Richard Schonberger termed this virtuous circle 'frugal' management. The more smoothly work is pulled through the system, the less wasted time, effort, space, inventory, rework, duplication, computers - and cost. </p> <p>Oh, yes, and management too. As Peter Drucker once lamented, 'So much of management seems to be preventing people doing their jobs.' </p> <p>A better aim for managers is getting out of the way. The best kind of management is no management at all. Simple, or what?</p> <p><strong>Less is more</strong></p> <p>'Push' engenders friction, and friction wastes energy. Telltale manifestations of push are: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> advertising and PR (a dismal substitute for distinctive quality and pricing) which are often self-defeating because they raise the general level of noise</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> HR programmes such as absentee management and other incentives (compensating for poor work organisation and command and control)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> internal communications (ditto) and targets, specifications and service level agreements (to make up for the fact that work is divorced from information and measures that would enable people to do it better).</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Coaches, consultants and other hangers-on in the executive suite (dead weights adding yet another element of burden to the management superstructure)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 'Culture change' (classic 'push'- meaningless and doomed as a standalone programme)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Bureaucracy is a sure sign of 'push' and complexity at work. Jim Collins, author of the influential Good to Great, noted that 'the purpose of bureaucracy is to compensate for incompetence and lack of discipline - a problem that goes away if you have the right people in the first place.'</p> <p>Collins found that companies that went from good to great paid 'scant attention to managing change, motivating people or creating alignment'. They didn't even worry very much about pay. They didn't need to. In management, less really is more.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk\">simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>With one simple announcement, all is well with the world champions. Which sounds a bit silly. How can world champions be unwell? 'Played like stink, and here we are, the best on the planet...' But this is England, and they are the world champions, and they are a bit poorly. And now they're going to be fine again. Because Jonny Wilkinson is the new captain.</p> <p>For the champions, denied the services of their leading points-scorer, it has been a year of plunging fortunes. Five defeats in their last six games. But don't worry, cos Jonny's back. Rise, fall, rise. It's positively tidal, this period of English rugby history. But don't fret. Here's Jonny, shoulder nerves reactivated, to calm the motions, control the flow, cup the injured sparrow in his hands and set hearts a-flutter. Metronome and pin-up in one. He has a special place in rugby.</p> <p>Can it all be so simple? Without wishing to drop guano on Nelson's column, I can't see it.</p> <p>This time last year, Wilkinson was about to be plunged into a personal playing crisis. He went to the World Cup, for me, as the best outside-half ever to have played the game. His accumulation of points spoke for itself, he thumped the ball off either foot and passed off both hands with complete ease and accuracy. If, going solo, he lacked the gliding elusiveness of Barry John, the jagged side-step of Phil Bennett or the 0-60 of Jonathan Davies he more than compensated by being the most ferocious tackler in their position by a country mile.</p> <p>At the World Cup the best player of all time fell to bits. Hell, it happens. He took half a step too far before clearing, he began to stutter on reception of the ball, his decision-making took him into heavy traffic. He buried himself in rucks, a lover of exposure - a naturist almost - seeking shelter in pit-pony darkness.</p> <p>And as his game disintegrated he, as vice-captain, presented himself before the world and set about wringing his hands in public. No, he put his whole self through the mangle. He talked of the goals he set himself, the pressure he applied on himself, the anxiety he suffered.</p> <p>By the time of the semi-final he was no longer flying solo at press conferences. He would be flanked by Lawrence Dallaglio and Martin Johnson. They looked like a pair of giant goons on either side of their flaky boss, purveying devoted respectfulness until a smirk broke out if Don Jonny threatened to go off on one, down martyrdom alley. They then gently steered him back to the task of playing France in the semi.</p> <p>To be fair, he was rigour itself against the French. He outplayed Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michalak, who had been threatening to steal the whole World Cup show but whose collapse in the Sydney rain made Jonny look like a model of sturdiness. Wilkinson was back, in the nick of time.</p> <p>Against Australia in the final, he of course dropped that goal. It was the moment of all time in the game of all time. But, to be honest, it was a simple kick. The pass from Matt Dawson may have placed him on the wrong foot, but the creeping set-up by the forwards had put him in exactly the right place. It was a bread-and-butter kick in front of the posts for a player who sends the ball over from the touchline for fun.</p> <p>Wilkinson took his chance unerringly and the parades followed. But Stephen Larkham, his opposite number - and even while receiving running repairs to a nasty facial injury - played more authoritatively on the night.</p> <p>So? Well, it just means that Wilkinson is not superhuman. For someone who is only 25, a lot of Jonny is already shrouded in myth, most of it deserved but some of which wraps him up in infallibility.</p> <p>Not only does he have a track record of losing the plot, but after his mythical moment he was also out of the game for nearly 12 months. A year is a long time in the politics of pain and we do not know yet if his shoulder and neck are fully up to the demands of making Test tackles. He hasn't put them through trials at Newcastle yet. He is, as everyone who has witnessed his comeback observes, 'easing his way back into things', which I think is another way of saying he isn't finding it that easy to rediscover the mastery of his trade.</p> <p>It hasn't prevented him from being fast-tracked to England. Barely back with his club, he has now been given the captaincy of his country. It is an appointment for the long term but it has triggered hopes of immediate fulfilment.</p> <p>Here, we run into the second obstacle to instantaneous revitalisation. The England Jonny rejoins is not the England he left behind in Trafalgar Square last December with the cheers of a million ringing in their ears. You can hear the cruel fates chuckle: with one hand they usher Jonny back, with the other they twist the knee of Richard Hill. They give; they take away. </p> <p>Hill may not be gone for ever from the back row, but he joins that list of heavyweights who will not be there to provide ballast aboard HMS Wilkinson. No Martin Johnson, Jason Leonard, Neil Back, or Lawrence Dallaglio. Such has been the form of others like Ben Kay and Steve Thompson - or such have been the injury fortunes of Phil Vickery and Trevor Woodman - that Jonny may have to peer hard through many bags under the eyes to make sure there are any of his old muckers left.</p> <p>The point is, I suppose, not to expect too much too soon either from Jonny or his team. This may be uncomfortable for Andy Robinson as he looks to moor himself to the job of head coach all the way to the next World Cup. But the simple truth is that England look vulnerable up front and behind.</p> <p>South Africa, as the new champions of the Tri Nations, will come to Twickenham in November with the robust clatter that is peculiar to them, while Australia will be more cerebral, without being exactly non-aggressive. In the New Year, the other five of the Six Nations will no longer walk in fear of being flattened by Johnson's pack within the first quarter of an hour. Kick off, ouch, game over.</p> <p>The pain may flow the other way for a time. Since we are only at the start of a four-year World Cup cycle, it dos not matter. Myth Night II does not have to be made today. Before it goes into production in 2007, we may have to grow accustomed to the sight of Jonny Wilkinson playing the part of mere mortal.</p> <p>You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "The barbaric murder of Ken Bigley concludes another difficult and gruesome episode in the drawn out tragedy of Iraq and the wider Middle East. No less disturbing, in Egyptian Red Sea holiday resorts, 28 people (mostly Israeli tourists) died in a series of what are believed to be al-Qaeda-inspired attacks. Not only does Middle Eastern savage and brutal terrorism approach new levels of careless inhumanity and disrespect for human life, there is no evident end in sight. Once again, we have to ask fundamental questions about the wisdom of American and Israeli policy and, since Britain is so closely associated with it, whether Mr Blair is right to offer the continued and largely uncritical support of Britain. <p>George W Bush has been anxious from the beginning to depict America as engaged in a war against terror, with himself as a wartime President. In this framework, terrorism had to be dealt with rather as states take action against home-grown terrorists. This was true of Afghanistan; if the Taliban did not collaborate in bringing Osama bin Laden to justice, then, it could be argued, there was an explicit case morally, strategically and in international law for invading the country that shielded him. </p> <p>The case for intervention in Iraq was always more finely balanced, and rested on the judgment that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, the capacity to make more and to use them and the readiness to support terrorist groups. As the Iraq Survey Group confirmed last week, Iraq had neither WMD nor the capacity to manufacture them, nor the immediate possibility of using them, even if Saddam nursed malevolent ambitions to do so. In the politics of hindsight, this plainly undermines a major plank of the pro-intervention case. But we do not operate with hindsight. The case for a pre-emptive intervention was that the evidence at the time - accepted among Western agencies including the French and German - pointed to Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction and had obstructed the implementation of key UN Resolutions. </p> <p>We now know that was untrue and that Iraq, by and large, had met its obligations. This does not mean that there were not strong grounds for believing Saddam posed a serious threat and for acting accordingly. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> New threat </b><br> </p> <p>Now we face a new threat. Fighting terrorism is about intelligent policing, successful international surveillance, monitoring flows of finance, dealing with arms smuggling and, most importantly, winning hearts and minds. Terrorists have an inbuilt disadvantage, since they should find it difficult to win the support of the vulnerable host population (though its support is crucial to their clandestine operations). The biggest mistake of the United States has been to wage war on terrorism as a war against states, undermining the key strategies it needs to beat terrorism on the ground. </p> <p>It is not enough simply to say that the world is better off without Saddam Hussein, though that is true. The balance sheet has to convince; negatives have to be set against the positives. On the negative side, the security position in Iraq, especially in the so-called Sunni triangle, looks intractably poor; Iraqi rule will have to rely heavily on American support to maintain order, which in turn will weaken its legitimacy. There are more terrorists in Iraq than before. And, the Israel-Palestine conflict looks far from resolution. With a two-state solution more elusive than ever, the Middle East is extremely volatile. </p> <p>On the positive side, most Iraqis welcome the removal of Saddam Hussein; civil society, whether measured in marriages or newspaper start-ups, is surprisingly vigorous. If the terrorism and security position could be stabilised, Iraq could find a way forward. </p> <p>For that, the US and Britain have to demonstrate how their long-term intentions square with an honourable settlement between Palestine and Israel. We are a long way from that. Every month that Sharon is indulged in the building of his fence and the expansion of the settlements in the West Bank is another month in which Palestinian resentment grows and more terrorists are recruited to hidden training camps. The most important contribution the next US President could make to world peace is to reverse the current stance on Israel. Our own Prime Minister should be insisting on this, both in private and publicly. </p> <p>One consequence of events in Iraq is that it is now harder to practise pre-emption. Any future British government would find it hard to win parliamentary support for a pre-emptive war, let alone public opinion. Winning support for a UN Resolution would be even harder. Yet in an era of globalisation and global terror the international legal position that what goes on within national borders is nobody else's business is not sustainable. As Mr Blair has argued, there needs to be change; but it will now be close to impossible to marshal support for such a change. The suspicion, rightly, would be that US neoconservatives could 'shock and awe' as they pleased. </p> <p>For the growth of an unhealthy US nationalism is another destabilising force today. Part of American public opinion and a section of its political establishment, is finding in Islam today a strategic enemy to substitute for the Soviet and Chinese communism of yesterday. Islam, though, is not a country. It is a religion and a culture which shares a common heritage with Christianity and Judaism, and whose global reach is as extensive. In Britain, we live side by side. We should not forget this when we hear others use the sloppy and dangerous language of a clash of civilisations. </p> <p>Ken Bigley was murdered by depraved terrorists - not depraved Islamic terrorists. The balancing act we must now perform is forensically to fight the war against terror, not against the countries and civilisation in which terrorism operates.</p>",
  "<p>There was a time when investing in new art was a simple business: you'd see a canvas or a bronze you liked, buy it, put it in your home, and wait for the artist to die. To some extent, this is still how it works. The catch is that many of today's challenging new artists don't much care for canvas and bronze, preferring to work with materials like flesh or snow, which make a mess of your home and are likely to rot away before the artist does.</p> <p>\"Any object presents issues,\" says Philip Long, a senior curator at the National Museum of Modern Art in Edinburgh, \"but artists in the 20th century have used an extraordinary range of different materials.\" That's putting it mildly. A visit to the Saatchi Gallery in London turns up pieces such as Love Lost by Damien Hirst, which consists of a gynaecologist's chair submerged in a tank of water full of fish. The chair rusts and the fish die.</p> <p>\"Some artists have made works in which part of the artistic concept is that they will effectively degrade,\" explains Long. \"Jean Tinguely, the Swiss artist, is a famous example of that.</p> <p>There was a particular work of his that struck me when saw it at the Tate a few years ago. It was a machine called Sculpture That Cuts Itself in Half, and there it was, slowly sawing through itself.\" Robert Hiscox has struggled with many similar items as chairman of the specialist insurer Hiscox. \"I had a Damien Hirst cabinet here,\" he says, \"which was one of the ones he did with used medicine bottles. The smell was phenomenal, and they were gradually turning funny, going off. When asked, he said, 'Yes, that's the whole point of it. It's great. Gradually it will ferment.'\" </p> <p>This is all very well for artists and audiences, but how can a buyer justify spending thousands of pounds on a piece that may change beyond all recognition within a decade? Hiscox is pragmatic about it.</p> <p>\"A lot of contemporary art is ephemeral. It has a potential end of value, like a lease. It may go up at the moment, but it will go down, which gives you valuation problems that must be sorted out.\" To attempt this, one needs a definite sense of whether work's perishability is a strength or a weakness.</p> <p>\"Galleries have got to ask themselves whether the fact that this work may degrade is part of the artistic concept of the work.\" says Long. \"We would always look at the individual circumstances of the work, and if we can, discuss it with the artist.\"</p> <p>The most practical way to look at ephemeral art is as an exploitable resource, whose value - both cultural and financial - must be extracted over the lifetime of the piece. </p> <p>\"We insured a block of salt put in the sea, which, gradually, was being washed away,\" says Hiscox with pride. \"And we have other examples of transient art. We insure it against things that can happen: an Andy Goldsworthy snowball, say, against being vandalised or run down by a car - anything other than it just disappearing in front of your eyes, which is the point of the art.\"</p> <p>What if an artwork does deteriorate, but its deterioration is not part of the point of the art? This has always happened with paintings, and now some of Britain's best known conceptual works are starting to suffer too. Tracey Emin's bed and Damien Hirst's preserved shark are certainly looking a little the worse for wear.</p> <p>\"Restoration is an absolute bloody nightmare,\" says Hiscox. \"When someone removes one used condom from Tracey Emin's bedside, is that a total loss or not? We have had problems in the past with someone removing one pen from a Joseph Beuys desk. If the artist is alive, can he put another pen there to recreate the work? Is Tracey Emin's bed, when it has fallen to pieces, going to be completely recreated by somebody other than her?\" </p> <p>Even in photography, authorship is important, Long points out. \"If you go to a photography exhibition, you may see that much is made of the fact that they are vintage prints - prints produced under the control of the artist. It's an important aspect of the market value - and the artistic value, because the artist will make a choice about the tone of the photographic print.\" </p> <p>So doesn't the restoration of art dilute the artist's influence and thereby devalue it? \"I think it's very hard to answer that in a general way. Of course it presents issues. I think some people might argue that restoration will increase the financial value.\" There is a compromise solution, but it is a rare and complicated one: agree a contract in advance for the artist to maintain the work themselves. Anya Gallaccio, whose 2002 work Because I Could Not Stop put real apples on a bronze tree, is said to have promised to regularly replace the rotting fruit for anyone who bought it. The trouble with an arrangement like this is that, when the artist dies, it must come to an end.</p> <p>A little consideration from artists might be best. New York-based Doug Fishbone, whose taste for perishable sculpture has led him to filling town squares with tens of thousands of bananas, was forced to think hard after sculpting a revolving selfportrait in a cylinder of doner kebab meat.</p> <p>\"The decay wasn't part of the process of that work because it was intended to be shown very brie\ufb02y,\" he says, explaining he meant to \"send up the arrogance and vanity of the art world\". Now the piece is in a freezer somewhere in Queens in New York. \"I'm sure it's a lot the worse for wear.</p> <p>\"That was a kind of oneoff piece,\" he continues, \"but I'm hoping that, if I were to make it in London and get it in front of people who collect that type of art, it might be something that I could sell. I have thought about working with a taxidermist in future - someone who's used to preparing that type of material for maintenance.\" </p> <p>For all its drawbacks, however, there remains one good reason why transient art will continue to be made: people like it. \"I'm an Andy Goldsworthy fan,\" says Hiscox, \"so I don't mind art that's here today and gone tomorrow. People are making it because they love it, and buying it because they love it. The fact that it will not be here in 400 years' time is tough shit.\"</p>",
  "A second man on trial for sex crimes on Pitcairn island has pleaded guilty to three charges of indecent assault. <p>Tractor driver Dave Brown, 49, pleaded not guilty to a further 12 charges. </p> <p>He said he was in love and in a consensual relationship with another girl he was accused of indecently assaulting. </p> <p>He told the court that the girl said she enjoyed having sex and wanted to continue their intimate relationship. </p> <p>Brown pleaded not guilty to two charges of gross indecency and 10 remaining counts of indecent assault, alleged to have taken place about 20 years ago. </p> <p>Since the investigation of sex abuse on the island began three years ago, the alleged victim has withdrawn her complaint against Brown. </p> <p>The prosecution is therefore basing its charges on a police interview during which the defendant admitted having sex with her while she was under age. </p> <p>Brown also denies sexually assaulting a five-year-old and her six-year-old friend. </p> <p>Most of Pitcairn's female residents have come out in defence of their men, insisting that under-age sex is part of the island's culture and that none of them was forced into it. </p> <p>But the prosecutors have alleged that the island's men treated women and girls as their harem. </p> <p>Earlier this week Dennis Christian, a relative of the island's mayor, Steve Christian, admitted indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl in the early 1980s. </p> <p>The court suppressed details about the other two charges to which he pleaded guilty. </p> <p>The trials, held under British law before New Zealand judges, are expected to take six weeks. </p> <p>The Pitcairn Islands have a permanent population of just 47, all on the main island, the descendants of Bounty mutineers and shipwrecked sailors. </p> <p>They lie midway between New Zealand and Peru and have a total land area of 18 square miles.</p>",
  "<p>Our small Cessna was being batted about by turbulence, and this was not a good place for an unscheduled landing. We were high above the Okavango Delta and its wastes of scrubby bush and purulent marsh, all swarming with hungry wildlife. Fortunately, our pilot, Barbara, was more than a match for a few errant air currents. </p> <p>Barbara was the first surprise of my trip which was to see a community tourism project involving the San people of northern Botswana, because she is San herself. Encountering her dispelled all preconceptions of visiting an indigenous group stranded in the stone age - though within living memory, many of the San were hunter-gatherers pursuing a lifestyle that had continued unchanged for 20,000-odd years. </p> <p>The Gudwiga project is an attempt to preserve some of the San's traditions before they vanish. Another aim is to provide funds for the development of the local Bukakhwe San community; despite the achievements of Barbara and others, most of the San live in poverty. </p> <p>A US-based non-governmental organisation, Conservation International, helped assemble the project. It is owned and largely run by the San, who have provided 18 of the 19 staff and management. Their base consists of eight huts built according to traditional design, but with welcome modern additions: electric lighting, showers and flush toilets. The guides' role is to educate visitors about the San way of life, but in the process they learn about some of their own traditions for the first time. </p> <p>\"It's important to pass on the culture from the elders,\" said Lets, one of the guides. Lets knew that his grandparents used to hunt with bows and arrows, but was vague about the details. \"I did not understand how they managed to kill large animals like giraffes with them,\" he said, \"until I discovered that the arrows were poisoned.\" </p> <p>One of the San's most singular feature is their languages, which incorporate unusually high numbers of clicking sounds. Equally distinguishing is the way the Bukakhwe oscillate their shoulders rapidly when dancing. At a session of music and dance I saw, the drumming, singing and ululating steadily merged and became overwhelming. </p> <p>In the cool of dawn next morning, we were taken out into the bush by a San woman, Theora. Traditionally, gathering vegetables and herbal medicines was a female responsibility. We saw a ball of elephant dung and were told that when coals are placed on it, the fumes help to keep mosquitoes away. Then there's the purple verminia plant which the San use to treat skin cancer lesions. Later, we were shown how to make a bird trap using a bush willow branch and thorns, with a piece of fruit for bait. </p> <p>The Gudwiga project goes beyond the standard approach of budget travel companies to indigenous cultures. It is a genuine attempt at cultural interaction and has partially reconstructed a way of life that almost vanished. </p> <p>The host community is the village of Gudwiga, five kilometres away, where large numbers of Bukakhwe San live. This is an artificial development created by combining several scattered settlements into one, part of a long run ning process which has turned the Bukakhwe into pastoralists who no longer have the right to hunt wildlife. </p> <p>Under current government arrangements, the Bukakhwe control a large area of land in partnership with a South African travel company, which hands back profits from the project after deducting costs. </p> <p>There does not appear to be the same level of dissatisfaction among the Bukakhwe that exists in the Kalahari to the south, where many of the San accuse the government of seizing land so that companies can prospect for diamonds. Even so, there has been dissent. \"Some of the older men were not happy about their game licences being removed,\" said one of the guides. That loss is the death knell for keeping traditional culture truly alive, yet it would be misleading to say the majority of the Bukakhwe San wish to re-adopt their forebears' arduous lifestyle. Despite the feelings of unease I took away with me, projects like Gudwiga might offer the best way forward. </p> <p><strong>Root and branch tourism</strong></p> <p>These projects are wildlife-oriented, but also have a strong emphasis on introducing visitors to traditional ways of life.

  "<p>'I t's sort of a mixture of climbing and drowning,\" said our instructor cheerfully as we clambered down the cliff towards the churning sea. A member of the local search and rescue team, Dave had spent the last two nights on Exmoor looking for a missing party of teenage girls. \"Not to worry,\" he said, pointing towards the crashing waves. \"Once I get myself in there I'll be awake alright.\" </p> <p>Coasteering is one of the fastest-growing sports in the UK. As far as I could tell, it involves most of the things that brought stern looks of disapproval when I tried them as a child: climbing cliffs before jumping into unknown depths; being dragged out to sea by powerful currents; swimming through tiny caves in complete darkness and, best of all, getting someone else to go first to make sure it is safe. </p> <p>\"Yes, that's fine, didn't even touch the bottom,\" said another instructor as he bobbed about in the swell. \"In you go ... \" The sentence trailed off as he was engulfed by a wave which dragged him out of site around the rocks. There was nothing else for it; a final check that the lifejacket and helmet were secure, then pick a gap between the waves and ... </p> <p>Coasteering is just one of a range of activities laid on by breathingspace - a fledgling activity company offering high-quality breaks for busy people in search of, well ... a breathing space. </p> <p>\"We are here to take the uncertainty out of organising an activity holiday,\" said Richard Best who, with wife Susan Radice, set up the company that also incorporates the UK's first dedicated surfers' hotels - Little Beach and, 200 yards up the road, Westbeach Studios, in Woolacombe, north Devon. </p> <p>\"We use only 'wow' locations and with the best local guides we can give people anything from extreme adventure to truly restorative experiences.\" </p> <p>Arriving in Woolacombe late on Friday, our main concern was that Little Beach would already have called last orders. There was no need to worry. The hotel, which, like Westbeach, commands superb views of the craggy bay, is a long way from the traditional seaside B&amp;B whose doors are locked at 10pm. </p> <p>The open-plan restaurant and bar is laid back, with life-size pictures of some of the longboard heroes of the 1960s and 70s adorning white walls. The menu - especially the locally-caught seafood - is superb and the view of the sunset is the stuff of local legend. The idea, says Alex Liddle, an ex-army surfing enthusiast who created Little Beach and has now joined the breathingspace project, was to move away from the traditional guest house or hotel where surfers are viewed as a necessary evil at best. </p> <p>\"I wanted to create an attractive laid-back hotel that was designed with the surfer in mind,\" he said. \"We've been full every night since the spring. Now what we are trying to do is emphasise that the fun doesn't stop because the summer's over. Some of the best surfing happens from now on and there are so many other things to do here; it's a beautiful place just to relax and enjoy the fresh air once some of the crowds have gone.\" </p> <p>Drawing the curtains the following morning, I consoled myself that the flint skies and biting wind would at least ensure a degree of solitude for my first surfing lesson - perhaps just a few hardy souls taking an early morning walk along the sands, oblivious to my cack-handed attempts to master the ultimate in lifestyle sports. But just after breakfast, strange wetsuit-clad beings began to emerge through the drizzle and within half an hour a dozen groups were spaced out along the sand, listening to their new mentors with the awed attention of school children on the first day of term. </p> <p>\"This is your board,\" said Alex, who, despite leading a late-night clubbing party into Woolacombe the night before, had assumed the role of surf instructor and looked annoyingly awake. Quickly gauging our levels of competence, he starts off with the most basic of basics. \"The first thing you need to know is how to hold it.\" </p> <p>So far, so good. </p> <p>\"The waves are not perfect today,\" he explained. \"But they are fairly powerful, so it should be pretty good for getting your eye in.\" And so it proved. After a quick land-based briefing which helped to demystify the surfing process, we took to the water. </p> <p>\"It's amazing how much more you get from this with just a few tips from people who know what they are doing,\" enthused an investment banker in our group as we battled with a sizeable swell. \"I've tried to surf twice before, but this is the first time I've really got the hang of it - I think I could be hooked.\" He is not the only one. According to the latest figures, surfing has an estimated 250,000 regular devotees in the UK. </p> <p>After an exhilarating battle with the elements, we dragged our exhausted bodies back to the comfort of Little Beach. A quick warm-through with home-made soup and some exaggerated stories of the waves we nearly caught and it was back to the beach for the next session. </p> <p> T he afternoon was much like the morning - exciting and exhausting in equal measure - and when it was finally time to leave the sea my thoughts turned to another treat, which, when I had signed up, had seemed like a huge extravagance, but was now an undoubted necessity: a massage. </p> <p>An hour of gentle rubbing, kneading and prodding in the comfort of my own room left me with an almost overwhelming urge to sleep for a week. But having read the blurb on the award-winning chef and drooled over the menu the night before, the bar proved an even stronger attraction. </p> <p>The next morning, as I pulled on my wetsuit and life jacket for the coasteering trip, Alex, who had again led the way round the clubs and bars of Woolacombe the previous night, explained why even on a Sunday morning in late September the hotel was full of people pulling on wetsuits and heading to the beach. </p> <p>\"Look at it,\" he said as the sun broke through the clouds, giving a stunning view of he bay. \"No congestion, no pollution and a real break from the stresses and strains of everyday life; it takes you out of yourself for a while and people appreciate that.\" </p> <p>Half an hour later, as I plunged off the rocks into the icy waters of the Atlantic, it seemed he may have had a point. Deadlines, targets and meetings seemed a long way away. <br><strong>Matthew Taylor</strong></p> <p><strong>From city to surf in a weekend ...</strong></p> <p>I'm a poor swimmer, have nothing by Mambo and didn't even know the thick end of a surfboard (the nose) from the thin end (the tail) until last weekend. I am, in short, the world's most unlikely surf dude. </p> <p>But Big Friday reckon they can turn an urbanite like me into a waxhead within a weekend. So I joined a 12-strong group, predominantly female and ranging from a Kiwi trance DJ to a network analyst from Essex, to catch the Surf Bus for the five-hour trip down to Newquay, the British surfing capital. </p> <p>Big Friday offers a range of weekend packages, from serious surfing and partying to chill-out post-surf pastimes at a secluded B&amp;B with its own reiki massage hut overlooking Harlyn Bay, just outside of Padstow. Our group stayed at the Boarding House, a lively but rather down-at-heel hostel-style surf lodge, located a hop from North Fistral beach. </p> <p>Fistral has some of the best surfing in Britain, and conditions from now until late October are at an optimum with sea temperatures around 16 degrees. Sadly, the vagaries of the British weather are beyond control and, at 10am on the Saturday morning, five-foot waves and on-shore wind were hardly ideal conditions for a group of beginners. </p> <p>Nevertheless, we ventured stoically into the swell after the safety talk from our instructor ('rather surly but looks great in a wetsuit,' according to one group member). For me, just getting into a super-clingy bodysuit proved tricky enough, let alone riding the waves Hawaii Five-O style. But, with practice, most people are up on their feet within the first two-hour session. </p> <p>That night we hit the town for dinner at the stylish Chy Bar, offering welcome relief from the stag-party frenzy of Newquay's downmarket big Saturday night. The next morning, some of the group were out catching early waves, while I headed for a stroll along the beach and brunch at a relaxed surf cafe on Watergate Bay. </p> <p>By the time we rolled back in to London's Victoria coach station on Sunday night, Big Friday hadn't made a surf dude of me, but a weekend of fresh air had banished the post-summer blues. 'It wasn't the cheapest weekend, but I liked the fact that everything is arranged for you,' concluded Bronwyn, a 25-year-old PA, as we said our goodbyes. 'Plus I feel loads better for an escape from the city.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Big Friday (020-7793 1417, <a href=\"http://www.bigfriday.com\">bigfriday.com</a>) runs weekly trips until the end of October, monthly thereafter throughout winter.

  "<p>The no-frills revolution that has dominated the aviation industry over the last decade looks set to continue - in the form of low-cost airport terminals. The explosion of passenger numbers and the sheer expense of building new terminals (the proposed Terminal 5 at Heathrow is costed at \u00a34bn) have had the no-frills carriers wondering why they should be so elaborate. </p> <p>New budget terminals at Bari, southern Italy, Geneva and Changi airport in Singapore are, respectively, being built, proposed or seeking building tenders. Low-cost carriers hope this new breed of purpose-built terminal will result in cheaper passenger charges, which in turn will mean cheaper tickets (if passed on to the passenger) or greater profits. </p> <p>The proposed Terminal 2 at Geneva, which is likely to get the go ahead shortly, is a good example of what to expect. According to a Geneva airport spokesperson: \"There will be no fancy architect, no escalators or stairs, mostly self-service check-ins, no business lounges, no air bridges, and generally a shorter journey between check-in and plane.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for easyJet, which intends to use the terminal, described these innovations as \"outsourcing to passengers\". </p> <p>The new Changi Singapore terminal, expected to be complete by early 2006 at a cost of \u00a37m-\u00a315m, will be much smaller than Changi's other terminals and will cater for around three million passengers. Long check-in queues are forecast. </p> <p>At present, most airport owners charge for each passenger the airline carries in return for maintaining the airport infra structure, including baggage handling, security and runway maintenance. The British Airport Authority (BAA) charges per person: Stansted (\u00a32.90), Gatwick (\u00a35-\u00a36), Heathrow (\u00a37-\u00a38). Stansted, a low-cost hub, has a price advantage similar to that assumed of the new brand of terminals. </p> <p>But what are the implications for travellers? \"The no-frills airlines have been the runaway success story in travel,\" said an ABTA spokesperson, \"but if travellers are delayed in a terminal with minimal services or even seating for 12 hours they may well think again about using that airport.\" </p> <p>A spokesperson for BAA added: \"The cost difference is less than a coffee at Starbuck's. The bulk of the cost of an airport is infrastructure and terminals are already pretty basic.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Flood</strong> <br>by David Maine <br>272pp, Canongate, \u00a312.99 </p> <p>Most first novels are eager to please, desperate to be noticed and embarrassingly autobiographical. David Maine's The Flood, longlisted for the Guardian's First Book award, is none of these: instead, he has written an elegant retelling of an ancient narrative, using the Biblical story of the flood to craft a moving meditation on families, faith and how people cope with global catastrophe. </p> <p>If you think you know this story already, but haven't actually read the relevant passages in Genesis, or read them a long time ago, you will be shocked by the callous details, the casual brutality, the sense of confusion, the terror of having to believe in a god who doesn't give a damn whether you like him or understand his motives. Maine adds to this feeling of novelty by basing his narrative on the Douay Bible, an English translation from the Latin published in 1609, and his characters have unfamiliar names: Noe, Sem and Cham rather than Noah, Shem and Ham. </p> <p>Maine refuses to modernise or sentimentalise the story. Noe is 600 years old, and the world has only existed for a millennium. A grouchy old man, Noe is brutal to his wife and, she thinks, can't even remember her name. One day, he hears a voice in his head, and pisses himself with terror. When the voice tells him to build a huge boat, he weeps, then gathers his family and orders them to start building. They think he's nuts, but don't dare disobey. Some giants arrive to help. A crowd gathers, jeering and laughing at Noe's hubris, although impressed by his ambition. \"It's not every day you see a ship growing in the desert.\" Someone offers to buy room for himself on the boat. Noe refuses, explaining that space could only be bought \"with a pure heart\". </p> <p>\"A stocky, tattooed man says, I'd rather barter for some of this. He hikes up the plump woman's tunic, and ruts her on the ground in front of the crowd. The men form a circle, tugging themselves.\" </p> <p>When the rain starts, the waters rise, and these same people are left outside the ark, begging to be allowed aboard. Staring down at them, Noe is jubilant. He stands on deck, jeering at the crowd: \"You can explain yourselves to Yahweh.\" When his daughter-in-law suggests that they rescue some of the children, Noe responds: \"We shall have children enough of our own.\" The world's population is swept away, and Noe rejoices: \"They were unclean in the sight of the Lord... Old is this world, a thousand years or more. It had grown heavy with filth and weary with sin. Now it has been scrubbed clean.\" </p> <p>Maine tells the story in eight voices. A narrator takes control of the chapters devoted to Noe, and the other characters - Noe's wife, three sons and three daughters-in-law - tell their own stories in their own voices. Some are loquacious; others terse and grumpy. Together, they create a wonderful description of a family coping with crisis. Confined to the boat, floating for weeks, they grow tired, bored, hungry and thoroughly irritated with one another. The sons bicker with their father; Noe's wife sighs, resigned, and does most of the work; the three daughters-in-law, sucked into this strange family, suddenly finding themselves the only fertile women on the planet, provide witty, caustic assessments of the situation and the other characters. These three women are never named in the Bible; Maine names them, gives them voices, and turns them into his most fascinating characters, tougher, more cunning and much more astute than any of the blunt, muscled men. </p> <p>Maine is an American who has lived in Morocco and Pakistan, and he writes with complete conviction about the desert, nomadic life and primitive communities. From the crumbling goats cheese to the psychology of the characters, everything feels right. What I most admired about The Flood is not just its honesty and authenticity, but Maine's refusal to give any easy answers or allow any simple readings. Again and again, there are enticing opportunities to draw metaphorical parallels with our own time. The oceans rise. Prophets decry the depravity of modern civilisation. With his impregnable faith, Noe might be Osama bin Laden or any of the other lunatics around the world who claim God is on their side. The flood might be the twin towers crashing down, destroying a decadent civilisation. </p> <p>Maine disdains all these metaphors, instead telling a story that cannot be read simply. No one knows Yahweh's reasons for making the flood; the innocent are swept aside along with the sinners; Noe puts an unfair curse on his grandson, sends his descendents in different directions across the Earth, and dies alone. These are the facts of the story, and they remain mysterious both to the characters and to the reader.</p>",
  "<p>The poplars are beginning to turn bright yellow and one's eye naturally follows the trees up the valley. Now is harvest time. It is the end of October and the almonds are being gathered in the fields. There are piles of cracked husks in the countryside and outside the cooperative in the local town. Ripe red peppers from the huerto (allotment) are strung up to dry against the whitewashed walls of the terrazas (verandas); tomatoes and figs are spread out on azoteas (rooftops). The only vegetables that are still growing are the calabaza (pumpkin), acelga (chard) and col (cabbage). Later the grapes and olives will follow, along with chestnuts and persimmons.</p> <p>It is time to prepare for the winter months, preserving the fruits that have been grown during the summer. The finale is usually the slaughter of a fattened pig. Over a couple of days the beast is turned into myriad salchich\u00f3n (salami), chorizo and morcilla (blood sausage), jam\u00f3n y paletillas (cured ham and shoulder), as well as tocino (pig fat) and panceta (cured pork belly) to last the whole year.</p> <p>Autumn is also the hunting season. It is common to spot hunters in camouflage clothing with their dogs around the mountains. They are after most wild things: perdiz (partridge), jabal\u00ed (wild boar), ciervo (deer) or cabra montes (the ibex or wild mountain goat). These are often stewed al ajillo, with garlic and wine.</p> <p><strong>Tasca burra (salt cod, tomato and olive salad)</strong></p> <p>The red peppers and tomatoes that are dried on the terraces and rooftops are often made into a salad called tasca burra. We have tasted a couple of versions, a simple one made with chopped dried tomato and red pepper, thyme and cured black olives, served with fresh cheese, flavoured with thyme, or a more traditional version with salt cod.</p> <p>Serves four.</p> <p>100g sun-blushed or half-dried tomatoes <br> 1 garlic clove <br> 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves <br> 75g black olives, halved and pitted <br> half tsp ground cumin <br> 2 dried \u00f1oras peppers, broken open and covered with boiling water, or half tsp sweet paprika <br> half small red onion, finely chopped <br> 100g salt cod, soaked for 12-24 hours, then skinned and shredded (optional)<br> 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil <br> 1 tbsp roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley <br> sea salt and black pepper</p> <p>Coarsely chop the tomatoes. Pound the garlic and thyme together in a mortar. Put all these in a bowl, along with the olives, cumin, peppers, onion and shredded salt cod. Pour over the olive oil, toss and season with a little salt and pepper. Serve with the chopped parsley on top.</p> <p><strong>Carne en salsa de almendras (pork in almond sauce)</strong></p> <p>Carne en salsa is found throughout Spain and is eaten as a tapa or main course. What makes this recipe particular to the Alpujarras area is the way the sauce is thickened with almonds.</p> <p>Serves four .</p> <p>6 tbsp olive oil <br> 50g whole almonds, preferably with skins on <br> 50g white bread, without crusts, roughly diced <br> 1 head garlic, plus 4 garlic cloves <br> 1kg free-range pork shoulder, trimmed and cut into 2cm cubes <br> 1 tsp sweet paprika <br> 2 small mild onions, halved <br> 1 large tomato, halved <br> 2 bay leaves (preferably fresh)<br> 1 dried \u00f1oras pepper, seeds removed and torn in pieces, or half tsp extra paprika <br> 400ml white wine <br> sea salt and black pepper </p> <p>In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over a medium heat and add the almonds and bread. Fry for a couple of minutes until golden, remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate with the four garlic cloves.</p> <p>Still with the saucepan on the heat, salt the pork and add to the pan, along with the whole head of garlic (sliced in half widthways so as to release its flavour), the paprika, onion, tomato, bay leaves, dried pepper and white wine. Simmer for 50-60 minutes, covered.</p> <p>Remove from the heat. With a spoon, take out the onion and tomato and transfer to a food processor along with the almonds, bread, the four garlic cloves and four tablespoons of the cooking liquid, and whiz until almost smooth. Add this sauce to the meat, replace on the heat and simmer for another 20-30 minutes, uncovered, or until the meat is soft and tender and the juice as thick as double cream (add water if too thick). Check the seasoning once more. Traditionally served with fried potatoes, but mashed would be just as delicious.</p> <p><strong>Pastel de almendras (almond cake)</strong></p> <p>We find many Spanish puddings very sweet, but this almond cake is delicious, and is made by Hilde, a friend of Josefa, who lives above our village. She prepares her almonds by soaking them in boiling water until the skins loosen and can easily be popped off. Almonds prepared this way do have a better flavour, which is preferable for this cake, though not essential. Serves six to eight .</p> <p>150ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for oiling the tin <br> 165g light brown sugar <br> 4 medium eggs <br> 175g blanched almonds, ground (some fine, some medium, some coarse, for bite and texture)<br> 100g plain flour, sifted </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. In a processor or with an electric whisk (or, indeed, by hand), whisk the olive oil, sugar and eggs together until pale and fluffy (about 10-15 minutes on a medium-high speed). This whisking is important as it beats air into the mixture and makes it light. Now gently fold in all but two handfuls of the almonds and all the sifted flour until evenly mixed, taking care not to knock out any air. Pour into a 26cm flan or pastry tin, sprinkle the remaining ground almonds on top, and place in the oven. Cook for 15-20 minutes or until the cake is firm and golden brown. Remove and cool on a rack. We ate this accompanied by an infusion made from local wild rosemary, thyme and rosebuds from the hills. Nectar!</p> <p><strong>Fresh cheese (with rennet)</strong></p> <p>One day we were sitting on the terrace when there was a loud knock on the door. 'Tengo queso fresco. Quieres?' (I have fresh cheese. Do you want one?). Five minutes later, the woman returned with a beautiful fresh cheese and a bunch of radishes from her allotment. Just a couple of days old, the cheese was soft, creamy and mildly goaty, made from the milk of her goats that roam around the foothills of the mountains.</p> <p>This inspired us to make our own cheese, which is so easy to do, provided you have what the Spanish call cuajo (rennet). Animal rennet comes from an enzyme extracted from the stomach of calves and lambs. Vegetarian rennet, often made from crushed cardoon flowers, is sometimes used in Spain and Morocco. You can buy both in supermarkets. Makes around 1kg of cheese.</p> <p>2.4 litres full-fat organic milk, goat's or cow's<br>half tsp rennet </p> <p>Gently heat the milk to 32C/90F, then stir in the rennet. Transfer to a stainless steel or glass bowl, cover with clingfilm, and leave in a warm place for half an hour until the curd starts to separate from the whey, and the milk sets. Cut the curd into 3cm squares with a thin knife to help release more of the whey. Cover and leave in a warm place for an hour. When the cheese is firm enough to lift with a slotted spoon, carefully transfer to a colander set within a bowl. Refrigerate for at least six hours, or until the curds and whey have fully separated and the cheese is firm. To speed things up, cut the curd into smaller cubes</p> <p>\u00a9 Samantha and Samuel Clark, 2004.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is an edited extract from Casa Moro, by Sam and Sam Clark, published by Ebury Press on November 4 at \u00a325.

  "<p><strong>Premature preamble</strong> We've waited 20 years for England v Wales, and it was well worth the wait wasn't it eh? Eh? Here we are, then: 7th in the world v 57th, Nicky Butt v Mark Pembridge, a past-it former Man United winger v a past-it current United winger, etc and so forth.</p> <p><strong>Team news</strong> As expected, Sven has in no way whatsoever ducked an awkward decision over Michael Owen. Here's the team: Robinson; Neville (G, not P), Ferdinand, Campbell, Cole (A, not J, or NK); Beckham, Butt, Lampard; Rooney; Defoe, Owen.</p> <p><strong>First email of the day, from a man who has better things to do</strong> \"My advice from the Austria match still stands,\" says Ian Bruff. \"Download Before Sunset [fab talky American film starring Ethan Hawke and the sumptuous Julie Delpy], and watch it instead of this match...which will be rubbish. All you need to say is: 5 mins: lots of fouls and no skill<br> 10 mins: lots of fouls and no skill<br> 15 mins: lots of fouls and no skill<br> 20 mins: England score scrappy goal<br> 21-90 mins: England spread 10 men across the edge of their penalty area. Wales get nowhere. It's very dull with lots of fouls and no skill.<br></p> <p>I do have an interest in saying this - I have to finish off a draft of my PhD chapter by tomorrow!\" Good luck. What's it on? Not the films of Richard Linklater by any chance?</p> <p><strong>Here's the Wales team</strong> Could be either 4-4-2 or 4-5-1, but Super Furry Fiver suspects the latter: Jones; Delaney, Melville, Gabbidon, Thatcher; Bellamy, Davies, Pembridge, Speed, Giggs; Hartson.</p> <p><strong>My 2p's worth on the teams</strong> It would be cynical to say Eriksson has only picked 4-3-3 to avoid the Owen decision - he played it at Lazio - but he's never picked this type of 4-3-3 with England before: when he's done it, it's been one focal point and two (Heskey and Vassell) coming in from wide. This looks to me more of a 4-3-1-2, and certainly very narrow.</p> <p>The upshot is that England have three in the centre of midfield against Wales's (probable) three, but overall it will be 5 v 3 in midfield, which is a risk in a game that will doubtless centre around a furious (and dirty) midfield battle. Conversely, if and when England do get on the ball, Rooney, Defoe and that other crewcutted bloke could do untold damage to the Coca-Cola centre-half pairing of Gabbidon and Melville.</p> <p><strong>Regrets? I've had a few dept.</strong> Earlier in the week, a well-known bookmaker (I use that phrase not in the 3am girls sense, but because my undersized brain can't recall which one) were offering 15/8 on Sol Campbell starting this game. 15/8! I thought about putting a monkey, a nugget or even a chimpanzee on it ... and in the end put nothing. Careless. Here's Ian Bruff, meanwhile, on his PhD: \"My thesis is comparing small and large European countries, saying that small countries have a different national culture to the large countries by virtue of being small.\"</p> <p><strong>Late team change</strong> Andy Melville has done himself in the warm up - which means Delaney to centre-back, Jason Koumas in and - probably - Simon Davies to right-back. Bet Joe Cole wishes he was playing now.</p> <p><strong>Cigarwatch</strong> \"Buenos dias Se\u00f1or Rob,\" says Pablo. \"Give us a plug - <a href=\"http://www.pablamos.com\">www.pablamos.com</a> - Pablamos Cigars Espa\u00f1a - el corruptee Se\u00f1or Barry Glendenning already took our bribes and enjoyed the rewards I believe (fast cars, women, casinos, okay a few Habanos cigars maybe). And for f**! sake tell these PhD party poopers to crawl back under their respective stones. I mean what is the 'kin point of a PhD anyway? I already got one years ago and you end up selling Cuban cigars on the net.\"</p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Here we go then. England 3 Wales 1 is my prediction, for the little it's worth. Meanwhile, a minute's silence for Ken Bigley is appallingly interrupted. Go home, you morons.</p> <p><strong>2 min</strong> Couple of promising early touches for Owen. \"Too early for Barry eh?\" wonders Brian Marples. \"Is he sleeping off last night's adventures?\" In Bazza's world, last night probably hasn't finished yet...</p> <p><strong>GOAL! England 1 Wales 0</strong> Frank Lampard scores from 20 yards via a big deflection offf Mark Delaney. Butt played it into Owen, whose heavy touch allowed Delaney to prod clear. It fell to Lampard, who thrashed it back, but it was going straight into Jones's arms until it span away off Delaney's leg.</p> <p><strong>7 min</strong> Well, well: we expected a fast start, but not from England. That has knackered Wales' gameplan completely. \"I am thick,\" sniffs Matthew Cobb. \"I don't understand 'a well-known bookmaker (I use that phrase not in the 3am girls sense)'. What does 3am girls sense mean and what on earth are you referring to?\" A-ha: simply, it meant that 3am girl-type columns contain questions like 'which well-known footballer was seen with his pants down shouting 'Give me catharsis' in the ladies' toilets in a west London nightspot'. So it wasn't that I couldn't name William Hill/Ladbrokes/whoever for legal reasons. Just that I, erm, couldn't remember.</p> <p><strong>9 min</strong> Free-kick in a dangerous crossing area for England, so Beckham goes for goal. Comfortable save for Jones.</p> <p><strong>10 min</strong> Wayne Rooney hits the post. A trademark, snaking run from midfield took him to within 25 yards and his low, skimming drive was fumbled by Jones on to the post.</p> <p><strong>12 min</strong> Rooney is getting on the ball all the time in the hole.</p> <p><strong>13 min</strong> Another opportunity for England. Splendid play between Cole and Lampard on the left; Cole fed Defoe, who wriggled away from his man awkwardly and then dragged a left-footed shot across goal from the edge of the area. A decent chance.</p> <p><strong>14 min</strong> Thus far, Wales have carried all the attacking threat of Mr Puniverse in a Royal Rumble. </p> <p><strong>16 min</strong> Like a Scotsman's stomach the day after the conclusion of a 64-day bender, the game is settling down a bit now. And yes, there are worse analogies than this lurking somewhere in my brain to be inflicted upon you later in the day.</p> <p><strong>17 min</strong> I'll get my coat: it looks like the goal came off Owen rather than Delaney - they look so similar, eh? Eh? - so that'll be Owen's goal, even though he was facing away from the ball and had his derriere sticking out like a badly dubbed version of Intolerable Cruelty at the time of the crucial touch.</p> <p><strong>20 min</strong> Owen is denied by Paul Jones's legs. Slick move from the front three: Defoe laid it off back to goal, Rooney slid the ball through and Owen, coming inside, went for the curler from about 12 yards. It was actually straight at Jones, who half fell backwards and side-footed it clear. The sort of save you see in a park kickaround.</p> <p><strong>22 min</strong> Wales have had enough possession, as you'd expect given their five-man midfield, but Ferdinand and Campbell - who was 15/8 earlier in the week to start this match; have I mentioned that? - look totally comfortable. As do the imperious Cole and Gary Neville, who predictably hasn't given Giggs, 30 going on 39, a kick.</p> <p><strong>25 min</strong> Wales's best effort, which, like a spotty 14-year-old trapped in a lift with Jodie Marsh, isn't saying much. Long free-kick is nodded by Hartson for Speed, on the corner of the box and facing away from goal, to flip the ball up and loop a volley over the bar.</p> <p><strong>27 min</strong> Cole has Bellamy in his pocket at the moment; his defending really has come on leaps and bounds in the past 12 months.</p> <p><strong>29 min</strong> Wales are having their best spell of the game now; Bellamy goes round Cole and makes me look an idiot before fizzing in a dangerous cross that is bundled away.</p> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Another crackerjack strike from Rooney 30 yards out ricochets to Owen in the box, but his first touch is heavier than a conversation between Dawson Leery and Joey Potter and the danger clears.</p> <p><strong>33 min</strong> England's attacking play has been slick at times, yet a little clumsy at the point of the kill - Owen and Defoe keep slipping and sliding as they shape to shoot 18 yards out. \"How old is John Hartson?\" asks Jon Wilks. \"Wasn't he in the same school year as Stanley Mathews?\" Year before - he used to nick his pocket money and flush his head down the dunny.</p> <p><strong>38 min</strong> Another half-chance for England: Owen on the left clipped a pass across the face of the box to Beckham, who set himself for a curler towards the far post - a bit like his screamer in La Coruna two years ago, only not so far out - only to shape it about five yards wide. He's got his preferred central role today, has Beckham, but of England's three he has been the least effective.</p> <p><strong>40 min</strong> The oles come out from the Hackett brigade, but the move ends with Gabbidon nutting Neville's cross well clear.</p> <p><strong>42 min</strong> From Giggs's free-kick, Speed's flashing, diving header is straight at Robinson. Fine effort, and a bit unlucky to pick out the keeper.</p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> That's it then: England have been pretty comfortable, with Cole, Lampard, Rooney and the centre-halves excellent, but Wales kept their heads after the shock of Michael Owen's absurdly lucky early goal. They now have to decide if and when to release Bellamy alongside Hartson.</p> <p><strong>Half-time abuse</strong> \"Just out of interest, why would anybody sit at their computer reading your erratic and inaccurate ramblings when they can just as easily get radio five live on the BBC website?\" asks Dan Fibious.</p> <p><strong>46 min</strong> We're back, with news that the referee has given the goal to Frank Lampard. Hmm.</p> <p><strong>48 min</strong> Gabbidon down and receiving treatment. \"I don't know if you are aware of this, but it costs $24.95 to watch this game on pay-per-view in the States,\" says Chad Thomas. \"So I'm reading your thoughts instead, for free!\" Technically it's free, Chad, but the regret and naff analogyitis that these minute-by-minute reports subliminally engender will come back to haunt you one day, probably when you're <em>that</em> close to sealing the deal with some all-American girl in one of those bars where people eat, like, four steaks in one sitting.</p> <p><strong>51 min</strong> \"I'm in work answering phones,\" says Joss, presuming this information is of sufficient importance to justify me publishing it ahead of the one other email I've got (and that containing a Welsh joke I probably shouldn't print). So your erratic metaphors are all I can get. At least they're frequent\". </p> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Michael Owen metamorphoses into an (admittedly constipated-looking) doppelganger of his 1998 self. Glorious solo run, darting in from the left, takes him past three, only for the last man - Gabbidon I think - to muscle him off it at the point of shooting. Great stuff from Owen.</p> <p><strong>53 min</strong> First yellow card, for a Pembridge foul on Defoe. It's hotting up. Giggs and Beckham, meanwhile, have a bit of a spat. And we all thought they were best of friends, eh? Eh? Oh.</p> <p><strong>54 min</strong> Jones saves a Rooney close-range piledriver, but the youngster should have played Defoe in as he was at a pretty awkward angle.</p> <p><strong>56 min</strong> Curling chip from Beckham - in an almost identical position to his first-half effort - is clawed down two-handed by Jones. Fine effort, and a goal is coming as Owen slashes wide from the edge of the box. Where's the Welsh passion?</p> <p><strong>57 min</strong> Steffen Iversen has given Norway the lead in Scotland. Oh dear. \"How does one go about getting a job like yours,\" asks Jon Wilks. \"I mean, that's not journalism is it?\"</p> <p><strong>59 min</strong> Pembridge off, Sunderland's Carl Robinson on.</p> <p><strong>61 min</strong> Lampard, played in on the left by Defoe, is wrongly given offside. \"I think the Governor of my town wants me to marry his daughter,\" says Mark Chandler. \"Lucky me, eh?\" Eh, etc.</p> <p><strong>63 min</strong> Like loose-limbed masochists, England will kick themselves if they don't win this. But then we've said that once or twice with Sven's men this year. Here's Paul Fairweather in Toronto. \"3am girls? That makes them 9pm girls here and you'll get no catharsis I can attest before the bars close at 2.\"</p> <p><strong>64 min</strong> Paul Robinson gets a rare touch of the ball, from Bellamy's misplaced cross. \"I'm watching in Beijing on BTV,\" says David Smith, \"and the commentator keeps saying Britian versus Wales.\"</p> <p><strong>65 min</strong> A flurry of ricochets ends with Bellamy shanking a volley comically wide from 18 yards. A very difficult chance, but one of the better ones Wales have had today.</p> <p><strong>68 min</strong> Eminem is coming on for him from Diff'rent Strokes, as Rooney forces a corner with some smart footwork.</p> <p><strong>69 min</strong> From said corner, from Beckham, Campbell thumps a header over from 10 yards.</p> <p><strong>72 min</strong> A Berkovic moment. Ben Thatcher's throw is flicked on, and Hartson hoofs Campbell flush in the face. As Campbell's header drifts clear, Simon Davies batters it into the corner. The whistle, of course, had already gone for Hartson's right-foot volley on Campbell's snout. Meanwhile, here comes Robert Earnshaw for Jason Koumas. It's not quite the cavalry, but he does have a useful scoring record internationally, even if he couldn't locate a barn door - let alone hit one - for West Brom.</p> <p><strong>74 min</strong> A magnificent through ball from Rooney gives Owen a chance, but Delaney blocks well for a corner. Glorious demonstration of the purity of Rooney's talent.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! England 2 Wales 0</strong> David Beckham, who has been useless all day, scores an utterly glorious goal. Darting infield from the left, 25 yards out, he arced a trademark curler over Jones and into the top corner; the side-netting in fact. It was almost a mirror image of his goal against Deportivo two-and-a-half years ago. Quite stunning.</p> <p><strong>77 min</strong> A bizarre incident. Three England players, led by Smith, harangued Gabbidon into a mistake, which left Beckham with an eight-yard volley that was blocked by Jones. The loose ball broke to Rooney, and his shot - which was probably going wide - was deflected to safety by Gabbidon.</p> <p><strong>81 min</strong> England are all over Wales now, and Wayne Rooney almost scores an even better goal than Beckhams. Zig-zagging majestically past four players, he was only denied by a brilliant last-gasp tackle from Gabbidon. Rooney is so blatantly the new Maradona that it's impossible not to get excited about the implications for ENgland onver the next ten years.</p> <p><strong>82 min</strong> Beckham gets himself booked in quite pathetic circumstances, following up on a previous incident with Thatcher with a needless tackle. He'll now miss the big one in, erm, Azerbaijan on Wednesday.</p> <p><strong>83 min</strong> Hartson passes up a presentable heading opportunity at one end, and Owen slams a 25-yarder straight at Jones at the other.</p> <p><strong>85 min</strong> Shaggy-haired scampered Owen Hargreaves comes on for Beckham, who is hobbling.</p> <p><strong>87 min</strong> Ledley King on for Wayne Rooney, who has again been - at times - spellbinding.</p> <p><strong>88 min</strong> Tremendous save from Paul Jones. Smith clipped a short-range cross in for Owen, flying in six yards out, to batter a header towards the corner. Jones dived to his left to palm it wide quite brilliantly.</p> <p><strong>90 min</strong> Four minutes of added time to, erm, add on.</p> <p><strong>Full time</strong> That's it: a comprehensive win for England, which could and should have been by a greater margin. Wales never recovered from the shock of conceding so early, and there was none of the 'breathing fire' guff predicted in the build-up. In fact it was all a bit tame, but England were worthy winners and Beckham scored a genuinely great goal. Thanks for all your emails, Rob.</p>",
  "<p><strong> QI</strong> (BBC2) is back, with Stephen Fry looking like a professor of Ancient Greek, who, through some frightful government initiative, finds himself in charge of Bash Street's sin bin. Not one of whom has done his homework and most of whom have no homes. Naturally avuncular, Fry comports himself with benevolence, ejaculating rarely heard ejaculations like \"Oh, lordy, bless!\" Who can fail to pity the man when he incautiously mentions that, when a rosy-kneed schoolboy, his tailor was called Gorringe. (This was apropos a rhyme for orange, the only other suggestion being Lester Piggott asking for porridge). Bash Street licked its thin lips. \"Which side does young sir dress on?\" they whined lasciviously. \"Would young sir like to wear a cravat on the cross-country run?\" \"You are all such beasts\" cried the tormented man, thrashing like a well-educated whale. </p> <p>(Fry Minor can count himself lucky.

  "<p>It's normally employed to drum up that missing address, phone number or website, or to check facts, dates, names and other miscellany. </p> <p>But now the internet search engine Google has added crime-fighting capabilities to its formidable armoury, helping to solve a grisly mystery that has perplexed a town in northwest America for more than a decade. </p> <p>A US detective embarked on a week-long web trawl with only Google for assistance to identify a man who died in an apparent hit-and-run accident 11 years ago in this small town in Washington state. </p> <p>The mystery had baffled law enforcement agents ever since. Over the years, investigators combed through missing-person databases in vain. </p> <p>But Detective Pat Ditter of the Washington State Patrol finally identified the victim as David Glen Lewis, a 39-year-old man from Texas. </p> <p>Lewis had no known ties to central Washington, and his presence in the area is still a mystery, Mr Ditter said. Relatives believe Lewis was kidnapped. </p> <p>Mr Ditter said he turned to Google after reading a series of newspaper stories about long-unsolved missing-person cases. By a process of elimination over several days, he narrowed down the identity of the corpse to one of about a dozen missing persons. </p> <p>Finally, he came across a distinctive pair of glasses in a photograph on the websites of the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Doe Network, an international volunteer organisation devoted to solving identification cases. </p> <p>On Monday, officials at a laboratory in Texas confirmed a DNA match between the unidentified pedestrian and Lewis's mother. </p> <p>\"If he hadn't looked at those cases, we would still be back at square one, thinking he's alive and going to give us a call one of these days,\" said the dead man's brother, Larry Lewis. </p> <p>Google has acquired dozens of new features and problem-solving tools, offering everything from word definition and translation to stock market prices, and even solutions to maths problems.

  "<p>By the time the Selfridges clock has finished chiming 10, the mobile phone store on the opposite side of Oxford Street is already full of customers. </p> <p>In a setting that feels more like a futuristic cocktail bar - all metal panelling and white faux leather stools - they wait in line to acquire the newest gadgetry with which to impress and amaze. </p> <p>Back on the pavement, successful customers can now watch the latest Franz Ferdinand video or catch up with that Thierry Henry goal they missed on Saturday. They can take a peek at scenes from the new horror flick, Saw, and find out where it is being shown. If they have forgotten where the cinema is, or indeed where they are, they can summon up a map. And, if they really want to, they can phone somebody up. </p> <p>Over the next few weeks and months, Oxford Street and other shopping centres across the country will be the scene of fierce competition between the mobile phone giants as they introduce their long-awaited \"3G\" handsets in time to catch the Christmas market. </p> <p>Shoppers will become familiar with terms such as \"walled garden\" and get to know which operator can offer Star Wars footage and which network best captures Wayne Rooney's shooting skills. </p> <p>Parents may be in for a shock if they do not keep an eye on their children's mobile phone use: downloading a video of Britney Spears's new offering from the only company currently providing a 3G service currently costs \u00a31.50 a go. </p> <p>But it will not stop there. In the not too distant future, media experts predict that every mobile user will be of the 3G generation, with the ability to hook into music videos, comedy clips and news and sports bulletins from wherever they may be. </p> <p>Developers are hunting for the best design and content to do for the mobile phone industry what the Sony Walkman and, now, the iPod have done for music on the move. </p> <p>Jon Corke, deputy editor of What Mobile, said: \"It's an exciting time to be a mobile phone consumer. The competition as we come up to Christmas is going to get fierce, which is good for the consumer. It's bound to increase again next year.\" </p> <p>The history of 3G is a tortuous and costly one. In 2000, at the height of the telecom boom, Vodafone, T-Mobile, Orange, O2 and 3, a newcomer to the market, paid Gordon Brown \u00a322.5bn for 3G licences. </p> <p>The great bonus of 3G is that it allows videos and other services to be downloaded far more quickly than other technologies. After a series of false starts, 3, whose Oxford Street store was so busy this week, unveiled the first British 3G service last year. But it was hampered by a clunky handset and content deemed to be unappealing, with too much news and not enough glamour. </p> <p>Now it offers music videos, along with clips of Premiership football games only minutes after the final whistle, cartoons, comedy clips, movie previews and reviews, showbusiness gossip and out-takes from a reality television show. </p> <p>The top brass at 3 do not like to talk about it much, but the \"adult\" section - films provided by Playboy and gambling from Ladbrokes - is also popular and a moneyspinner. </p> <p>Gareth Jones, the chief operating officer of 3 UK, said he was convinced the phone industry was at a \"turning point\". He said: \"The mobile phone industry has given people too little for too much for too long. That will have to change.\" </p> <p>Mr Jones said 3 was trying to provide users with \"snacks\" of entertainment. \"It's for people who've got a couple of minutes free two or three times a day and want to be entertained.\" </p> <p>Where some analysts believe 3 has gone wrong is to keep its customers within what is known as a \"walled garden\". The user of a 3 phone can get access only to the services 3 wants it to. There is no opportunity to reach the internet and the goodies that independent service providers may have come up with. </p> <p>By the middle of this summer, however, 3 boasted 1.2m customers - 70% of them male and most aged between 18 and 34 - and is believed to be adding around 65,000 a week. </p> <p>Each of 3's customers faces a bill of \u00a343.22 a month, more than \u00a3500 a year, around double the national average. </p> <p>3's handsets have won plaudits. They are still not as sleek as the best of the non-3G models, but its bestseller, the LG8120, is at least more like something Captain Kirk might have used than a metal brick. </p> <p>Vodafone, Orange and T-Mobile have all announced in the past few weeks that they are going to follow 3's foray into the 3G world. </p> <p>This is good news for companies such as Monstermob, which specialises in the sale of mobile phone \"entertainment content\". Its chief executive, Martin Higginson, welcomed the moves, saying: \"3G will help give consumers a better, more rewarding experience.\" </p> <p>In a redbrick office block in Cambridge, meanwhile, the best brains of Bango.net, which acts as a link between content providers and phone companies, are hunting for the elusive \"killer application\" that will make 3G phones indispensable, as the search engine did for the internet. </p> <p>Some believe that the run-up to Christmas may only be a first skirmish. Roger Taylor, chief financial officer at the Carphone Warehouse, said he expected the real battle to happen next year when the companies roll out more new handsets and services. He said: \"Then we'll see prices for services start to come down.\" </p> <p><strong>Video wars: what the companies offer</strong></p> <p>Battle lines are being drawn up between the main mobile phone companies.

  "The second presidential debate turned into a bare-knuckle battle for the White House last night, with George Bush and John Kerry dropping all pretence at civility as they savaged each other's records. <p>In an encounter that bristled with animosity, both candidates were on almost constant attack, setting out sharply opposing positions from Iraq to the economy, supreme court judges, abortion, and the environment.</p> <p>Last night's debate - the second of three encounters - caps a difficult week for Mr Bush, with opinion polls showing a tightening of the race for the White House after his lacklustre performance in last week's televised contest.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the CIA chief weapons inspector discredited the administration's rationale for the war on Iraq by saying that Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction. Mr Bush also suffered a setback on the domestic front yesterday with the release of disappointing new job figures.</p> <p>An AP-Ipsos opinion poll published hours before the debate put Mr Kerry slightly ahead with 50% support compared to 46% for Mr Bush, raising the stakes of the encounter.</p> <p>For Mr Bush, under deepening pressure to make up for the shaky performance and angry scowls of last week's debate, the rematch was his chance to reassure Americans that he was of presidential material. Strategists for Mr Kerry were hoping for a forceful appearance to build on the momentum of their first contest.</p> <p>Unlike their previous encounter, last night's contest was a town hall debate, with voters posing questions that had been vetted earlier in the day by a moderator. The candidates paced across a vast red carpet, making occasional attempts to bond with the spectators, but mostly focussing their fury on each other.</p> <p>For campaign operatives, the intensity of last night's engagement was designed to give voters a clear idea of the differences between the candidates. </p> <p>\"The president's view of the world is black and white and there is no grey at all,\" said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Kerry campaign. \"John Kerry showed that he understands these very complicated issues and could negotiate them.\"</p> <p>Dan Bartlett, the White House communications chief, said: \"There were some key moments where I think the president highlighted in a very effective way the problems in Senator Kerry's record.\"</p> <p>In practical terms, that meant that Mr Kerry used his portion of the 90-minute encounter to drive home his argument that Mr Bush - because he won't acknowledge his mistakes on Iraq - is dangerously out of touch with reality.</p> <p>Mr Bush, in turn, focused on portraying Mr Kerry as a liberal who would raise taxes, and who was naive on national security.</p> <p>But neither candidate gave ground willingly.</p> <p>The first question, to Mr Kerry, echoed a Republican charge that has followed the Democratic challenger throughout the campaign: that he is wishy-washy, and tailors his opinions to the prevailing political winds.</p> <p>Mr Kerry immediately turned the question into an attack on Mr Bush's conduct of the war on Iraq. \"The president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq so he has turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception,\" he said.</p> <p>And so it went, with Mr Kerry and Mr Bush trading barbs on taxes, jobs, Osama bin Laden, and the deficit.</p> <p>When Mr Kerry promised he would not raise taxes on the middle classes, Mr Bush sneered: \"Of course he is going to raise your taxes.\"</p> <p>When Mr Bush unveiled his plan to trim a deficit that had ballooned under his watch, Mr Kerry replied: \"He's added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together. Go figure.\" </p> <p>After the debate, Republican and Democratic strategists both predictably proclaimed outright victory, but neither side appeared overly confident, and the outcome was not as clear as in last week's debate.</p> <p>That contest was decided by Mr Bush's angry grimaces and evident impatience, broadcast to 65 million television viewers. </p> <p>By last night's debate, the president had his temper mostly under check, but his anger was evident as he scribbled frantically in a large notepad, or jumped out of his seat to answer questions. He also interrupted the moderator to angrily denounce Mr Kerry's charge that he had failed to build a coalition for the war in Iraq.</p> <p>\"You tell Tony Blair we're going alone,\" he said. \"Tell Silvio Berlusconi we're going alone. Tell Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland we're going alone. We've got 30 countries there.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush also appeared more in control of his material - unlike the first debate when he clung relentlessly to a few poll-tested slogans - although he faltered in his answers on the environment and the appointment of supreme court judges. He also provoked muffled laughter from the audience when he mentioned the \"internets\".</p>",
  "<p>A US judge last night dismissed a $1.25bn (\u00a3690m) lawsuit alleging that Conrad Black and others looted the Daily Telegraph's former parent, Hollinger International, of hundreds of millions of dollars. </p> <p>The verdict was a rare legal victory for the fallen press tycoon and a spokesman for Lord Black described the ruling as \"a stinging setback to Hollinger's campaign\" against him. </p> <p>The suit was brought by Hollinger International directors who accused Lord Black of plundering the business on a vast scale. It also named Lord Black's wife, Barbara Amiel, and three other former directors. It claimed that they had taken unapproved non-compete fees when they disposed of assets, sold themselves newspapers for bargain prices and received excessive levels of compensation. Federal judge Blanche Manning dismissed it for technical reasons. </p> <p>Hollinger International claimed the alleged looting was a violation of the US \"racketeer influenced and corrupt organisations act\", or Rico. Under the racketeering law it sought triple damages of the $380m the firm claimed had been looted and also asked for $104m in interest. Judge Manning said the case should be tried under securities fraud law instead. </p> <p>Lord Black has denied any wrongdoing and launched two defamation claims against Hollinger and certain directors. Hollinger International recently published a 500-page internal report that added further detail to the allegations made in the racketeering lawsuit. In court, the firm argued that the alleged looting went way beyond securities fraud. </p> <p>Judge Manning disagreed. She said the alleged offences were actionable as securities fraud and therefore were barred from being prosecuted under Rico. </p> <p>\"To facilitate and disguise\" the alleged scheme, she wrote, the defendants allegedly used \"wire and mail\" fraud that resulted in the firm making \"material mis-statements and omissions in its financial records and public filings\". </p> <p>Hollinger International, which owns the Chicago Sun-Times and The Jerusalem Post, is considering its alternatives, including an appeal. Interim chairman Gordon Paris said the company would continue to vigorously pursue its claims against Lord Black and his associates.</p>",
  "Is there a second party political leader who cannot say sorry? In yesterday's Guardian, Polly Toynbee described the anger in Brixton generated by Michael Howard's speech to this week's annual Conservative party conference. In it he made a most serious allegation against the police, suggesting they had abandoned the inner-city district. More precisely, he said that on a visit to Brixton three weeks earlier he had walked the streets for two hours without meeting \"a single policeman, not one\". He went on: \"This was inner-city London just before midnight, on a Saturday night. No wonder people feel the police have become distant and remote.\" <p>So angry was the community consultative group, which brings residents and police together, that it wrote to Mr Howard expressing exasperation at his failure to check his facts. Brixton has been enjoying one of the largest drops in crime in London: a 9% fall overall in the latest annual figures, with even bigger reductions in the crimes that communities most fear: burglary falling by 17%, car crime by 22%, gun crime by 24% and robbery by 36%. The police were just as angry. Detective Chief Inspector Glynn Jones declared: \"Basically, Mr Howard, go and shove it. If you want a lesson in leadership and delivery you could get it from no one better than [the local] Lambeth borough commander Richard Quinn, awarded the Queen's Police Medal and one of the masterminds behind the London-wide Operation Safer Streets.\" </p> <p>Indeed, there was even less excuse for Mr Howard getting his facts wrong. Two weeks before his speech, his \"Brixton walk\" had already featured in separate reports in the Daily Mail and Evening Standard. In a polite response the borough commander pointed out that there were 15 officers working in Brixton town centre at the time as well as a separate intelligence-led team tackling gun crime. All this was ignored by Mr Howard, even though the main theme of his conference speech was \"rebuilding trust\". Neither the police nor the community has had an apology. This is no way to build trust.</p>",
  "A giant American database, which is being used by the Tories to root out swing voters, is being hailed by Michael Howard as the party's secret \"tool\" which could transform next year's general election. <p>Senior Tories told the Guardian that the Voter Vault system, which identifies 400 social characteristics, is proving a great success in identifying voters who have abandoned the party in the past decade. </p> <p>The Tory high command believes it is on the verge of finally identifying its own \"Mondeo Man\" or \"Worcester Woman\", the sort of upwardly mobile voters who flocked to New Labour in the mid-90s. </p> <p>\"We have a new tool,\" one senior Tory said proudly. \"It is something we have borrowed from the US. The notion is that if you know what people's social characteristics are, it is not too difficult to identify how they will vote.\" </p> <p>Voter Vault, which is being used by the Bush campaign, looks at people's shopping, eating and lifestyle habits. This is based on the Mosaic system which is used by supermarkets to work out which products to target at shoppers. </p> <p>The new system \"vaults\" this commercial information to predict how people will vote. That in turn allows party workers to focus their efforts most efficiently on those individuals most likely to respond to canvassing. </p> <p>An example of a key finding in the US is that Volvo drivers rarely vote Republican. </p> <p>At the heart of Voter Vault is a graph that places the tendency of people to vote against their tendency to vote Conservative. The Tories identify potential voters by taking a list of people who vote - this is publicly available - and setting this against certain pieces of information about them from the national census. They then identify Tory voters by examining the characteristics of 20,000 of their party members to work out what sort of people vote Tory. </p> <p>The two groups are then placed together to identify swing voters - people who vote and who have Tory tendencies. In one study of 340,000 people the Tories achieved an 82% success rate in predicting who would vote for them. </p> <p>Liam Fox, the Tory co-chairman who imported the system, said yesterday: \"This is potentially very significant. In the 2002 mid-term elections in the US, Voter Vault helped the Republicans increase their vote by 4%. This is politics of the margins but this is where elections are won.\" </p> <p>Dr Fox added that Voter Vault gave the Tories a useful advantage over Labour, which was using outdated systems to identify voters by areas. \"Politics is now becoming very fragmented. The days when you could say this is a Labour street or this is a Tory street have gone. You can't even say this is a Tory or a Labour house. Voter Vault allows us to get round that and do 'virtual' canvassing of constituencies.\" </p> <p>Next month's US presidential election will pit the Republicans' Voter Vault technology against the Democrats' equivalent, DataMart, in the first duel between the rival databases. The Republicans have a head start. They used Voter Vault to devastating effect in congressional elections two years ago, focusing their time and resources on voters who were most likely to be persuaded to vote for them. </p> <p>Before 2002, candidates would purchase databases state by state and district by district from a specialist company called Aristotle. Voter Vault was the first true national voter database. </p> <p>It was built by Seattle-based Advanced Custom Software, which - according to PC World magazine - contracted much of the work out to Compulink Systems of Maharashtra in India, leading to questions over whether the data could be stolen while being shipped around the world, and inevitable accusations of \"outsourcing\". The Republicans say all the work on Voter Vault since 2002 has been done in the US. </p> <p>For the 2002 elections, the database sucked in state voter information, census data and membership information from scores of clubs and interest groups. It allowed the Republicans to shape their message to reflect the leanings and concerns of each voter, and to fly President Bush to areas where he would be most effective. </p> <p>\"In the old days people walked and knocked on every door,\" said Michael Cornfield, at the Pew Internet and American Life Project in Washington. \"Now they just knock on the doors where they have reason to believe they'll get a favourable response.\" </p> <p>Partly as a result of their advantage in getting their supporters to the polls, the Republicans won back control of the Senate in 2002 and consolidated their hold on the House of Representatives. </p> <p>Rattled, the Democratic party scrambled to catch up, and has since built up its version of the technology, DataMart, into a list of 166 million voters, just 2 million smaller than Voter Vault. The party has a second electronic contacts book known as Demzilla, of donors and activists. But unlike Voter Vault, neither system has been road tested.</p>",
  "The current home secretary is known for keeping a dog close to him, but it seems that there could be a canine solution to one of Mr Blunkett's biggest job problems. <p>A conference for pet-lovers in Glasgow this week was told of an American scheme in which young convicted killers, rapists and thieves were given a badly behaved dog to look after. The creators of Oregon's Project Pooch claim that, in 100 test-cases, all the men and pets stayed out of trouble. Perhaps Sherlock Holmes spoke truer than he knew in believing that the key to solving crime was a dog that didn't bark. </p> <p>This solution to hounding out crime emerged on the same day that one of the home secretary's rather less heart-warming schemes for reforming young thugs was given encouragement to continue: the high court threw out a challenge from three members of a gang of seven whose pictures were publicised in support of antisocial behaviour orders given to them for intimidating a north-west London community. The trio had claimed that publication of their faces breached their right to privacy. The police insist that distribution of the images reduced crime in the area by a fifth. </p> <p>These cases offer an intriguing coincidence of starkly different approaches to solving serious crime: mug-shot or mutt; name-and-shame or tame-and-shame. </p> <p>Apart from the reported 20% reduction in crime, the Asbo posters can easily be justified by the relief that will have been given to the people terrorised by the young thugs identified by the ad campaign. And while the group Liberty, which backed the three complainants, was doubtless using the legal argument most likely to succeed, it's hard to sympathise with a claim for privacy from men who invaded the space and lives of residents on a housing estate. </p> <p>Even so, the legal case against such stigmatising campaigns is weak - the practical objections are stronger: any reduction in crime needs to be balanced against possible unintended consequences. </p> <p> Six of the seven men identified on the posters were black. This detail invites either a shrug that this was a mere fact of the criminality being targeted, or a fear that pushing such leaflets through doors encourages fear of a particular race. And there is a risk of misidentification and a possibility of vigilante action. </p> <p>At a time when the authorities have been discouraging similar snap-and-shame exercises in the popular press (especially rogues' galleries of alleged paedophiles), it seems strange for the police to be distributing sheets of fear that face the same dangers. A likely effect of this week's high court ruling is that the populist press will feel encouraged to run their own Asbo galleries. </p> <p>The thought nags that the 20% crime-drop achieved by the Asbo-posters and the total makeovers claimed by Project Pooch both demonstrate not the triumph of criminology but the brilliance of statistics: there may be other factors involved. </p> <p>Yet, whatever doubts it might invite, we can see how Blunkett's favoured method might work. Instinct suggests that the members of the Asbo gangs would be unlikely to become less threatening if each was handed a psychologically damaged dog to look after. Indeed, anecdote and observation give the impression that many cheerfully reoffending criminals in Britain are already inseparable from their large, dysfunctional dogs. </p> <p>A believer in Project Pooch, however, would point out that the difference in those cases is that neither thug nor mutt is under any pressure to improve: the point of the scheme is that destinies of man and dog become linked. </p> <p>Proselytisers from Oregon claim that the system works because - when confronted with a disobedient animal - the criminals come to appreciate how irritating their own bad behaviour must be. Although this is simply an extension of the American theory that the use of pot-belly belts and shitting-and-screaming dolls will discourage schoolgirls from pregnancy, it seems fanciful in the canine application. An alternative - and far sadder - explanation of the Oregon dog effect is that these young men have never experienced loyalty, love or respect from any source. </p> <p>The success-rate claimed by the dog advocates of Oregon is so extraordinary that police forces here should probably grasp the lead, at least as an experiment. Even if it didn't work, there are far less obvious ways in which it could go wrong than the bigotry, vigilante attacks and misidentification that may result from the practice of printing pamphlets of local baddies. </p> <p>A Tory home secretary introduced the Dangerous Dogs Act in the hope of making the streets less frightening. It is proof of the complications of enforcing law and order that it now seems he should have simply handed each rottweiler to a young repeat offender. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "As a newly minted British citizen, I spent the week wrestling with this country's passport application process, but my efforts were accompanied by unpleasant background music, sung loud and clear from Bournemouth. Michael Howard led the tune, with its catchy refrain of \"controlled immigration\". And of course Ukip was singing its own versions of \"foreigners go home\". <p>What a cacophony this produced in my head ... as very recently I had received a letter from the home secretary in my Being a British Citizen pack, praising, in dulcet tones, my \"decision to become a British citizen\". </p> <p>When, earlier this year, David Blunkett announced the creation of US-style citizenship ceremonies I scoffed at the idea. How could the government come up with such feel-good fluff while so many were languishing in detention centres, or were deported? </p> <p>Imagine, then, my annoyance at finding out that these ceremonies were compulsory. Hence my recent appearance at a community centre in Leytonstone, to be welcomed by Waltham Forest council to the country I had been living in for more than five years. </p> <p>During the hour-long ceremony, my cynicism softened. I observed my new fellow citizens - some in jeans, some in hijab - as we pledged, under a serenely smiling picture of Her Maj, to \"give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its rights and freedoms\". Was I really in the right country? Could this be the same home secretary that used the Thatcherite expression \"swamping\" about asylum seekers? And isn't this the Britain that produces newspapers with screaming headlines about the threat of \"foreigners\"? </p> <p>As we finished the ceremony with a mumbled version of God Save the Queen, I realised that this was a Britain I had not seen before - one that, just for a few hours, really did seem welcoming. </p> <p>Being American and white, I felt that I had always been out of range of the right's steady stream of rhetorical gunfire. But the struggle isn't unknown to me - try being an Italian-speaking immigrant in the Midwest, as my grandmother was. </p> <p>Herein lies the difference: the US, for all its faults, once welcomed immigration, and built part of its national myth on it - although the nostalgia was more about the Irish in the 1800s and less about Mexicans in the 2000s. But contrast this to Britain, where outsiders are outsiders and the British are British. Many people are working to change this, but the events of this week show there is a long way to go. So, as contrived as these citizenship ceremonies seem, we need them. </p> <p>There may be a paperwork backlog in the Home Office; the government may still cruelly deport people; but one positive thing the country can do is to welcome its new arrivals. It could be the first step in actually making real the idea that we are an inclusive society. </p> <p>The American writer Seymour Martin Lipset argues that being American is an ideological commitment - a person chooses to be American, being born there is no criterion. European identity, on the other hand, is linked to community - it is about the place you are born. In the US, a person can be called \"un-American\" for doing things deemed unpatriotic, but a person can never be un-British, no matter how much they dislike the Queen or Tony Blair. But in this globalised age when economic migration is often not a choice but a necessity; when wars and famine force people to leave their homes; and, here, when the European project is reshaping ideas about nationality, should we not dismiss notions of who we are based on where we are born, and embrace, instead, where we want to be? Britishness is not a birthright - Britain belongs to the people who choose to live here. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:carrie.gibson@theguardian.com\">carrie.gibson@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, yesterday tightened his grip on Britain's railways by stripping the Strategic Rail Authority of its autonomy. <p>Mr Darling has been increasingly concerned about the SRA's spending. He pre-empted the authority's abolition, which is due to happen through legislation next year, by issuing directions requiring it to consult him over any decision in the run-up to its demise. </p> <p>Under the rules, the SRA needs Mr Darling's consent before taking any steps towards amending or replacing train operators' franchises. </p> <p>It cannot produce any strategy documents on the running of routes without his approval and he will get regular updates on its spending, including the progress of the troublesome modernisation of the west coast mainline. </p> <p>The SRA's emasculation is the first step towards the implementation of Mr Darling's white paper, which transfers the running of the rail network to his department. </p> <p>The authority's chairman, Richard Bowker, resigned in protest at the plans last month. He was replaced by his deputy, David Quarmby. </p> <p>The SRA was established four years ago to provide leadership for the industry. But critics say it faced too many competing pressures from the rail regulator, the government and Railtrack, and more recently from Network Rail. </p> <p>Mr Darling became frustrated with the SRA's profligacy and with slow progress in improving punctuality. He was also irritated by ambitious strategies which included a plan to build a new high-speed line from London to Scotland costing more than \u00a310bn. </p> <p>A railways bill to abolish the SRA is expected to be included in the Queen's speech next month. Insiders say the government is hopeful it will receive cooperation from opposition parties, so it can be implemented rapidly. It hopes to close the SRA and to transfer many of its 380 staff to the Department for Transport by early autumn next year. </p> <p>Civil servants have expressed concern that a series of key decision are due before the SRA's closure, including a new franchise on the east coast mainline. The inter-city service between London and Edinburgh, which is run by GNER, is facing a strong challenge from Virgin Trains. </p> <p>Many of the SRA's recent franchise awards have been controversial. Critics say they failed to take adequate account of past performance by ousting strong performers such as Anglia Railways. </p> <p>An SRA spokesman said the authority had agreed to yesterday's changes. He denied that the authority had been emasculated but said: \"They do set out a closer relationship between the SRA and the Department for Transport than was documented before.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Gordon Brown</strong> <br>by Tom Bower <br>320pp, HarperCollins, \u00a320 </p> <p>One thing is for sure, Gordon Brown won't be sending copies of this book round as Christmas presents. Tom Bower is not celebrated for looking on the kindly side of his subjects; he gives the benefit of the doubt as sparingly as Silas Marner dishing out fivers at Christmas. I would hate to be given the Bower treatment. You'd keep saying: \"No, that was meant to be a joke!\" Or: \"I only did that because he asked me to! I'm not really a monster!\" </p> <p>Bower starts as he means to go on. Few people seem to have had a kind word for our chancellor. Even his brother is called in aid: John Brown told friends at university that Gordon was \"boring, but very clever\". Later he quotes a popular gag about the chancellor: \"A man who can brighten a room just by leaving it\". From a host of revealing anecdotes, we learn that, in 2000, Brown, Tony Blair and Robin Cook were so wrapped up in hatred of each other that they chartered three separate planes to fly themselves to a European summit in Lisbon. The great panjandrum of prudence had helped cost the taxpayer \u00a330,000. </p> <p>Brown's self-preening budgets are treated with almost throwaway contempt. Yes, inflation is low, but it is low around the world. Unemployment is also low, but that's because about one million healthy people are receiving invalidity benefits. Economic growth is substantially less than it was under John Major, our productivity remains hopeless, the balance of payments is worse than ever before, no one is saving, and Brown's raids on pensions have been so predatory that we are all going to spend our old age catching squirrels for the pot. It is a picture that the Tories would be delighted to paint, if they had the words or, come to that, the platform. </p> <p>In fact this is as much a polemic as it is a biography. Of 492 pages, only the first 42 are spent on Brown's life before he entered parliament. By page 141 he is walking into the Granita restaurant for that fraught meal with Tony Blair in May 1994. Here I feel considerable sympathy for Brown. He had always been the senior partner in the relationship, formed when the two men shared an office in 1983 and realised that they had the same view about what Labour had to do to rescue itself. Brown was the brains, the tough professional politician, battle-hardened in the hell men call the Scottish Labour party. Blair was an eager Islington lawyer. </p> <p>To realise suddenly that he had been outmanoeuvred, that he wouldn't be getting the ultimate prize, must have been as hurtful as it would for an eldest son to be told he wasn't going to inherit the house and land because his little brother looked better on television. </p> <p>According to Bower, the so-called \"deal\" at Granita was nothing of the sort. Blair merely said that, if he did become prime minister, he wouldn't be in the job for ever; after perhaps 10 years his old pal Gordon should get a chance. The bitter and inconsolable Brown seized on this as a cast-iron promise. Life for him must be like drinking a cup of gall that constantly refills itself. </p> <p>But there was a formal agreement at Granita, and it effectively made Brown co-premier - or as you might put it, prime minister (domestic affairs). His command of the Treasury spread out to all the other spending departments, where ministers discovered that they were working under his command. Attempts to plead over his head to Blair, now reduced to being prime minister (Iraq), failed because Blair had signed away too much of his authority. </p> <p>The book is full of instances where Brown simply ignores Blair, pursuing his own expensive and unworkable schemes. It's as if Billy Liar woke up to find that he really did run his own nation, and that his hare-brained ideas affected real people's lives. As one minister is reported to have said this week: \"The Treasury is like Fallujah. We have no idea what's going on in there, we have no control over it, and all we know is that it's full of fundamentalists who are fanatically loyal to their leader.\" </p> <p>Little escapes Bower's gimlet and disapproving eye. Brown's relationship with Geoffrey Robinson, for example, as he scoffs lobster and champagne affordable because of Robinson's skilful use of tax havens. His instant revenge on any civil servant who raises objections to his plans - or who even furnishes statistics which did not prove Gordon right. The way he ploughed on with his favourite Individual Learning Accounts, even when the evidence of massive fraud was virtually forced down his throat. </p> <p>If a challenger to Brown emerges in the closing years of Blair's rule, they will certainly want to press copies of this book into the hands of the party electors. Which makes Bower's conclusion somewhat surprising. He finds much to praise in Brown's work; most people think it \"fundamental and sustainable\". When, in June this year, he became the country's longest-serving chancellor since the 19th century, \"he had acquired an unchallenged reputation for personal competence.\" Will he ever become prime minister? Bower judges \"probably, and deservedly, his bid will be successful\" - though not, curiously enough, on the evidence in this book. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Simon Hoggart's Punchlines: A Crash Course in English with John Prescott is published by Pocket books.</p>",
  "<p>Sports enthusiasts labouring in sedentary jobs can now grab the opportunity to turn their passion into a new career. The Institute of Sport and Recreation Management (ISRM) has launched Train-to-win, an initiative to promote various career opportunities available in the sports and leisure sector. </p> <p>The idea is to make people aware of the variety of jobs on offer in sport, providing advice on how people can break into the industry and gain qualifications through learn-as-you-earn training schemes. </p> <p>Most people's idea of a career in sport will focus on the high profile professional sports, such as Premiership football, formula one racing or the pro-golf circuit. But there are tens of thousands of people who make their living in sport through coaching, fitness training, sports science and many other areas. This sector employs nearly half a million people and offers jobs to suit everyone, from part-time lifeguards to full-time marketing experts and people with managerial skills. </p> <p>Ralph Riley, chief executive of the ISRM says: \"The sports industry is a growing market, which offers an exciting and challenging career, away from the confines of a desk job. We can't all be professional footballers, but many people can turn their sporting hobbies into a great career. </p> <p>\"What people are not sure about is how to get started. As the professional body for the sport and recreation industry, we aim to develop people's skills and careers. There are currently 12,000 people in the industry accredited by the ISRM, who have gone on to provide safe and exciting sporting opportunities for the public.\" </p> <p>Take Gareth Kirk, an ISRM member who worked as a soccer coach in the USA. On his return to the UK he started work in the marketing department of The Deep, a \u00a346m futuristic aquadrome in Hull. The visitor centre, said to be the world's first \"submarium\" with a 100ft-deep pool alive with sharks and swordfish, budgeted for 350,000 visitors - but some 850,000 have been through the doors in its first year. </p> <p>Today, Mr Kirk is assistant manager at Greenwich Leisure, a social enterprise company that manages York Hall in Bethnal Green, London. The famous boxing venue, where champions such as Lennox Lewis and Audley Harrison learned their craft, also has two swimming pools and a gym. </p> <p>Mr Kirk, who started as a fitness instructor two years ago, says that although very often it is hard graft, the variety of the work keeps him very interested in his job. He could be helping with lifeguard duties in the morning when the local school is using the facility and spend the afternoon preparing the venue for a televised boxing match that evening. </p> <p>The job requires a sound technical knowledge of running the building and facilities and an ability to communicate with customers. Leisure centre managers also need to be able to control and motivate a diverse workforce. </p> <p>The ISRM runs a range of courses and professional qualifications, which provide people with the recognised skills to work in the sports and recreation industry. Run in partnership with City and Guilds, they allow participants to gain vocational training whilst working. </p> <p>Courses cover a range of subjects from sports skills and health and safety to business administration and management.

  "<p>A hangover at NatWest<br> </p> <p> <strong>Q</strong> My marriage ended nine years ago - and with it, the joint NatWest account I held with my ex-wife. </p> <p>I ended this financial relationship with the procedure NatWest suggested. I assumed that was the end of it. I entered a new relationship and put the past behind me. </p> <p>But last year, NatWest told me I owed \u00a31,610 on this account. I then discovered this debt had been on my credit record since 2002. </p> <p>I then realised the only person who could have run up this amount was my ex-wife, after I had taken myself off the account. At the time the marriage ended, the balance stood at zero. </p> <p>I then spent time and effort convincing NatWest this was not my debt and they should chase my ex-wife, if they could find her. </p> <p>After a year of worry, working my way through the bank's system, and wasting a huge amount of my time, NatWest finally conceded it had got it wrong, and it had failed to record my \"resignation\" from the account. </p> <p>It wrote me an apology. And it sent two bottles of very average Chilean wine. </p> <p>Is this enough? </p> <p><strong> PT, West Midlands </strong></p> <p> <strong>A</strong> No. You were entitled to believe your old account was well and truly closed. It was not - and credit reference agencies discovered the outstanding debt before you did. </p> <p>Although you eventually ensured NatWest saw sense, you spent days writing letters, rewriting them because the bank's credit people did not enter a dialogue with you, and in seeking advice from your union, Citizens Advice and a local legal clinic. You also had to deal with debt collectors. </p> <p>But worst of all was the effect this might have had on your present relationship. Your partner could have suspected the break with your ex-wife was not so clean. </p> <p>When Capital Letters intervened, we pointed to a 1908 case where the Privy Council found that impunging someone's reputation to be able to repay debts could be construed as defamation. </p> <p>NatWest now concedes its initial response - the wine -was inadequate. It will apologise for your distress resulting from the failure to remove your details from the joint account. </p> <p>It will now send you \u00a3750 in compensation. And you can drink the wine. </p> <p> <strong>Q</strong> I bought a newly built flat in March. One attraction was the fitted kitchen, complete with all the appliances I would need. The builder handed over the guarantee documents for the electrical items with the keys. </p> <p>I noticed problems with the dishwasher and the electric oven, both made by Hotpoint. I reported these faults in early May. I arranged a convenient mid-May date for an engineer's visit. The dishwasher was fixed. But the engineer was not qualified to repair the oven. </p> <p>Hotpoint then said I would have to wait six weeks for an oven engineer to visit. I had to take a day off work as I live alone and Hotpoint only give a date, not a time. </p> <p>No one turned up. Hotpoint then offered late July. I took a day off - an engineer arrived but he was only qualified for dishwashers. The next time the engineer was sick. And the subsequent repairer was only qualified on dishwashers. </p> <p>I am quietly going mad. Please help restore my normal happiness! </p> <p><strong>BA, London</strong> </p> <p><strong>A </strong> This is a total mess. Presumably, your double repair request was just too much for the system at Merloni, Hotpoint's owners, resulting in total confusion between dishwasher and oven repair people. This led to days of your valuable holiday time being wasted while you waited in. </p> <p>After the last failure in late August, you tried for a month on your own to get an engineer to sort the oven. </p> <p>You went from pillar to post, with everyone blaming everyone else and no one willing or capable of taking on your complaint. </p> <p>Capital Letters told Hotpoint that it had a contract with you to ensure the kitchen items worked properly within the guarantee. </p> <p>Hotpoint/Merloni was unable to explain why nearly five months had elapsed since your first call. But it did agree you had not been treated in a way that extolled its brand values. </p> <p>It has now sent a real oven engineer who discovered the problem was no more than a loose fan mounting, less than one hour's work. </p> <p>It also agreed you were due compensation for your wasted time. It first suggested \u00a3100 - rejected as too low. It raised its offer to \u00a3300, then \u00a3500. Both of these were turned down as inadequate. Finally, Hotpoint/Merloni offered \u00a3700, which you have accepted. </p> <p><strong> Can IF take my home for debt?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong>Q</strong> I opened a current account with Intelligent Finance in November 2000. It had a \u00a3700 overdraft limit. </p> <p>I ran this up to \u00a33,500. I closed the account in April 2001 and arranged a \u00a3100 a month deal with IF but as it did not freeze interest and penalty charges, the debt was rising faster than I could pay it back. I stopped after seven months. </p> <p>I now owe more than \u00a313,000, rising by around \u00a3250 each month. IF has applied to a court for a charging order over my home. Can you get it removed?</p> <p><strong>VD, Co Durham </strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> Your IF account was a disaster from the start. You ran up the debt because cheques used to open the account bounced after you spent the money. </p> <p>You did come to an agreement with IF. But IF did not change your monthly statement to reflect the deal, so it kept adding on unauthorised overdraft interest at nearly 30% plus late payment charges. This is contractual so there is no point challenging IF's arithmetic. </p> <p>The charging order for \u00a313,059 only applies if you sell your home and realise a profit after the mortgage has been repaid. If you do not move, IF gets nothing. </p> <p>How much help you deserve is debatable. But Capital Letters will give you the benefit of the doubt because your husband is on medication for severe depression and you have an assessment next week with a psychologist. </p> <p>Capital Letters has agreed a stick and carrot approach with IF. You can pay \u00a350 a month for seven years - \u00a34,200. Provided you keep up that schedule, IF will again wipe off the interest and abandon the charging order. Or you can pay \u00a32,800 any time (\u00a33,500 less the \u00a3700 you repaid in 2002) and the near \u00a310,000 in interest and penalties will be wiped clean and the order torn up so you can remortgage or sell freely. But if you fail, you could be facing a \u00a350,000 bill in seven years' time, backed by a legal charge if you sell. </p> <p><strong> Time to get my free gift</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong>Q</strong> I signed up for a \u00a36,500 personal loan with Alliance &amp; Leicester in January. This was fine. But there was a special offer of \"his'n'her\" watches. These have never arrived and A&amp;L does not want to know. Can you help? </p> <p> <strong>A </strong> It seems there was some confusion due to your not quoting a \"special offer\" code. But your flyer did not have a code while still promising the watches. A&amp;L did not accept this - even when you offered to send in a copy of its own advert. </p> <p>It now concedes you were mistreated. It will send you the watches plus a \u00a325 voucher for a major store. </p> <p><strong>DM, Aberdeenshire </strong></p> <p><strong> Will CIS give the hard sell?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong>Q</strong> Jobs &amp; Money recently recommended CIS travel insurance for older people. My sister phoned for a quote but was told a \"consultant\" would visit her home to fill in the forms. She refused as she feared a sales pitch. Was she right? </p> <p><strong>A</strong> CIS travel cover has no age limit and no medical underwriting for the under-75s. So it's a good deal for many. Buying an annual policy is simple - you can do it over the phone or internet as well as face to face. </p> <p>But single trip customers must have an existing relationship with CIS or have a home visit from an adviser. CIS says no attempt will be made to sell anything else. So it is not suitable for last-minute travel decisions. </p> <p><strong>HO, Liverpool </strong></p> <p><strong> Co-op can't account for it </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong>Q</strong> I saw details of a Co-op Bank fixed term bond paying 5.55%. I sent off a form with a \u00a320,000 cheque. </p> <p>The bank kept my cheque for three weeks before saying the account was closed. Then I was offered compensation, but nothing arrived. Then the bank said my money was in a lower paying account - despite having returned my cheque. Can you sort this?</p> <p><strong>A</strong> This was a comedy of errors. The bond was very successful and withdrawn the day you sent your cheque. Then the bank thought you were applying for another account. Finally, it did not link returning your cheque with the failure to open the original account - or anything else. The Co-op admits it flopped on customer service standards. It will send you \u00a3100 and a fulsome apology. </p> <p><strong>AC, Glamorgan </strong></p> <p><strong> Home claim on shaky ground</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong>Q</strong> I bought a Paymentshield mortgage protection plan in 2002. I claimed in May for unemployment but I was turned down on demonstrably false and specious grounds. I have tried the Ombudsman but have not had success. What should I do now?</p> <p><strong>A</strong> Give up. HSBC subsidiary Hamilton, which handles claims for Paymentshield, is on strong ground. </p> <p>As Jobs &amp; Money has often warned, payment protection plans are a waste of time for those in fixed term contracts or self-employment. </p> <p>You are a journalist. You had a six-month contract at a legal publisher until April. You then went freelance. </p> <p>The only way you can claim is to prove your business has permanently ceased trading. You did this by giving notice of cessation to the Inland Revenue after just three weeks of not getting work. </p> <p>This is hardly enough to test any business plan. So its ending was not outside your control. And unlike some businesses, it is not easy to stop journalism - all you need is a pen, a pad, a phone and a computer. </p> <p>You might have had a mis-selling case against the seller. But as you cannot remember how or where you bought it, that course would be tough. </p> <p>JB, London</p>",
  "<p>Standard Life was this week accused of breaking its promise to mortgage endowment policyholders. </p> <p>The insurer is effectively abandoning a pledge it made four years ago to help bail out mortgage endowment customers facing shortfalls. </p> <p>The move deals a blow to more than half a million peo ple and means many will now receive top-up payments that are thousands of pounds less than they were expecting. And, of course, it worsens the plight of homeowners who have already been warned their policies are set to fall short of the amount needed to pay off their mortgages. </p> <p>Standard Life launched its \"mortgage endowment promise\" in September 2000 - a move which brought a stack of positive media coverage. \"Standard Life guarantees its endowment mortgages\" was the headline in the Guardian at the time while another newspaper described the move as \"a breath of fresh air\". </p> <p>Two years ago, Jobs &amp; Money revealed how the promise seemed to be unravelling, and now the Edinburgh-based firm looks to be ditching its pledge in an attempt to keep the City sweet ahead of a planned stock market flotation. </p> <p>Standard Life says the changes to its promise mean someone with an endowment maturing in 2015 who was told they were in line for a maximum top-up of \u00a34,700 is now likely to get as little as \u00a31,880. However, for some policyholders it will be a lot worse than that. Below we give details about one fairly typical policyholder whose endowment is due to mature in 13 years' time and whose payment under the promise looks set to be slashed from \u00a313,200 to just \u00a35,280. </p> <p>Back in 2000 the company pledged that, subject to certain conditions being met, as long as future investment earnings averaged 6% a year it would top up any shortfalls so people would not have to dig into their own pockets. </p> <p>\"To give them [our customers] peace of mind, we've made a promise (subject to certain conditions) to pay the full target value on mortgage endowment plans,\" said the company in its 2000 annual report. Many commentators interpreted this as meaning that, provided the conditions were met, all borrowers would be in the clear. </p> <p>But it later emerged the promise only applied to those who were told back in 2000 that their policy may be at risk of failing to hit its target amount. Those people who have fallen off-track since then were not covered. </p> <p>On Thursday Standard Life said that \"the capital growth condition required for our promise has not been met, nor do we anticipate it being met in the foreseeable future\". Since 2000 the company has been setting aside \u00a3100m a year to meet possi ble payments, but has now decided to stop doing this and plans to use the \u00a3393m already in the kitty to make top-up payments to eligible policyholders. </p> <p>The 65,000 people whose policies mature between now and December 31, 2005, are the lucky(ish) ones - they will receive maximum top-ups. Payments under the promise to people whose endowments mature after that date will be gradually reduced to around 40%-60% of the maximum amount previously announced. </p> <p>Standard Life says it will be writing to all eligible policyholders in the coming weeks with details of the impact of this decision. The move affects 600,000 policyholders covered by the promise. </p> <p>It's all a big blow for the insurer's army of endowment holders, who have in the past few years suffered repeated cuts to policy bonuses and payouts. As recently as January this year, the company was still reassuring people that even if investment returns were less than 6% a year, \"Standard Life currently intends to pay a top-up towards any shortfall up to the maximum promise amount (although this would not cover the shortfall entirely)\". </p> <p>This wasn't the only bad news emanating from the insurer which, despite all its talk about how things have got \"a lot tougher,\" is spending about \u00a310m on advertising this year, including a TV ad campaign. </p> <p>The company warned policyholders to prepare for more bonus and payout cuts over the next couple of years. </p> <p>And it announced it is joining Norwich Union and Friends Provident in setting final deadlines for customers to complain about being mis-sold endowments which they bought from tied agents and the insurer's own direct sales force. In the majority of cases, these \"time-bars\" will apply from the end of May 2006 onwards. </p> <p><strong>The pain in pounds and pence</strong></p> <p>The best way of understanding the impact of Standard Life's apparent dumping of its endowment promise is to look at what it will mean, in pounds and pence, for a typical policyholder. </p> <p>Just hours after the company's announcement on Thursday, Jobs &amp; Money was contacted by a worried policyholder who is now facing a much bigger shortfall as a result of the firm's actions. </p> <p>His 25-year endowment is due to mature in 2017 and has a target sum of \u00a360,305. </p> <p>Before this week's announcement the promise was worth as much as \u00a313,205 to him. Now it's likely to be worth as little as \u00a35,282. </p> <p>The man, who is paying \u00a374 a month into his policy, sent us a copy of his last statement from November 2003. </p> <p>This states that, assuming future investment growth of 4% a year, his endowment might at maturity be worth \u00a331,500 - but with the top-up payment under the promise this would increase to \u00a344,705. </p> <p>On returns of 6% a year (which the firm says is a \"reasonable assumption\") his policy would be worth \u00a339,400, but the promise payment would lift this to \u00a352,605, although still leaving him \u00a37,700 short of his target. </p> <p>Standard Life is now saying that for policies maturing in more than 10 years' time, the top-up payments will be \"gradually reduced to a level in the region of 40%-60% of the maximum amount previously communicated to policyholders\". </p> <p>In his case, this cuts the value of the pledge by nearly \u00a38,000. </p> <p>Clive Scott-Hopkins at IFA Towry Law says windfalls from the planned demutualisation may help to offset anticipated shortfalls.</p>",

  "<p>I'm not sure what led me into the world of pharmacy - my father used to design lots of brochures for pharmaceutical companies so there were always lots in the house - maybe that was the subconscious influence.</p> <p>I was always going to do science A levels, and knew I wanted to do a vocational course - a degree in pharmacy seemed right. When I did it it was three years (it now takes four) and it has to be followed up with a one-year, on-the-job vocational practice which I opted to do at the Joyce Green Hospital in Dartford.</p> <p>I was assigned a mentor - a senior pharmacist - to oversee my work as I went about the wards and rotated through other areas of hospital pharmacy including medicines information. I faced real patients with real requirements and had to find the best course of medicine - all overseen by my mentor.</p> <p>As a pre-registration pharmacist we are taught to prepare medicines in special sterile environments, including nutrition products for people unable to digest food and chemotherapy for patients with cancer.</p> <p>At the end of the year we took exams to enable registration with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and, because I wanted to stay in London, I got a job at the Chelsea and Westminster.</p> <p>As a teaching hospital it is a fantastically stimulating place to work.

  "He has spent his life documenting the struggles of the poor and excluded, in films ranging from Cathy Come Home to last month's Ae Fond Kiss. <p>Now Ken Loach is taking on the might of Canary Wharf in a row that mirrors his acclaimed 1998 film Bread and Roses, fighting for the rights of cleaners in the lucrative financial institutions on the Docklands estate. </p> <p>The film-maker will premiere the director's cut of Bread and Roses in London next Thursday to promote a campaign to improve cleaners' pay and conditions. </p> <p>But plans to march on the Canary Wharf estate the next day have been axed after its owners applied for an injunction to ban the protest, pointing out that it was privately owned and there were no public access rights. </p> <p>The T&amp;G called off the demonstration after the Canary Wharf Group threatened to go to the high court to stop the march, claiming it would \"severely compromise the security of the estate\". </p> <p>Bread and Roses celebrated the Justice for Janitors campaign in the US, which won decent wages and working conditions for thousands of low-paid workers. It also helped to inspire the current campaign by the Transport and General Workers Union and the East London Communities Organisation (Telco). </p> <p>\"This is the first of what will be a long war with many battles,\" Loach said yesterday, adding that he had planned to join the march. \"I feel connected to this issue after Bread and Roses. I hope the employers will be forced to pay them a living wage and give them proper contracts.\" </p> <p>He said: \"The situation in Los Angeles was very similar. People are very vulnerable, but office cleaners there really did get organised and made sure offices couldn't function unless they were treated fairly. </p> <p>\"I would have thought everyone would think this is a very just cause.\" </p> <p>The union says workers earn as little as \u00a35.20 an hour, with the statutory minimum of 12 days' holiday and eight public holidays a year and no sick pay or pensions. </p> <p>It argues that a minimum living wage in London would be \u00a36.70 an hour, and believes that all workers should receive sick pay, pensions and greater holiday entitlement. </p> <p>Neither the Canary Wharf Group nor companies based on the estate employ the cleaners directly. But the union argues that companies should ensure all workers receive a living wage. </p> <p>\"The people ultimately responsible are those who deal out the contracts. The buck stops there,\" said Loach. </p> <p>The campaign has already had some success. Last week Mitie Cleaning, which manages workers at the law firm Clifford Chance, agreed to raise wages and holiday entitlement. In June ISS, a multinational cleaning company which has cleaning contracts for Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, agreed to recognise the T&amp;G. </p> <p>In a statement the Canary Wharf Group said yesterday: \"The whole of the Canary Wharf estate is privately owned and there are no rights of access over it which are enforceable by the public. Canary Wharf Group is very conscious of its relationship and obligations to its tenants and is concerned with the effect of any demonstration on private property. We believe the event will severely compromise the safety and security of the estate.\" </p> <p>It added: \"This decision does not reflect any view of Canary Wharf Group on the merits of this march.\" But police had raised no concerns about the demonstration, which was arranged to coincide with the European Social Forum (ESF), a four-day global justice conference starting on Thursday. </p> <p>Hundreds of leaflets advertising the event had been distributed across Europe prior to cancellation of the march. </p> <p>The Guardian is media partner of the ESF, which is expected to attract at least 20,000 delegates from trade unions, charities and community groups across Europe.</p>",
  "The last time Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal worked in London it was as a waiter and bricklayer. Since then he has become a heart-throb of Latin American new wave cinema. Next year he will be back in London - this time round he will be starring at the Almeida theatre. <p>The 25-year-old appeared most recently as Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara in Walter Salles' The Motorcycle Diaries. </p> <p>This year he also won praise for his role in Pedro Almod\u00f3var's latest film, Bad Education, in which he played a drugged-up drag queen. Other successes include Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n and Amores Perros. </p> <p>For the Almeida, Bernal will take the role of Leonardo in Garc\u00eda Lorca's drama Blood Wedding, in which a young Andalusian bride elopes with her childhood sweetheart on her wedding day. </p> <p>The production will open next May, directed by Rufus Norris. \"Gael has got total access to all the layers of humanity,\" Norris said. \"In Motorcycle Diaries and Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n and Amores Perros I was struck by the openness of him; he is vulnerable, funny and sexy.\" </p> <p>It will be the first theatre Bernal has tackled for some while - but not the first time he will have acted in London. He trained at the Central School of Speech of Drama before being whisked off by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rrituto make Amores Perros. </p> <p>Bernal was approached previously by the artistic director of the Young Vic to appear in London in a production by Norris. While he agreed in principle, his shooting schedule prevented him from taking part.

  "<p>For a film with such limited circulation, the cast on the screen is mightily impressive. Grinning, slightly unsure of himself, on assignment for Rolling Stone magazine, there's Truman Capote. Accompanying him, brandishing the cassette recorder that is now his constant companion, Andy Warhol. And, of course, there's the star of the show. Just in case you couldn't guess this was him, he's wearing a sequinned body suit. This, of course, is Mick Jagger.</p> <p>The cast list - essentially comprising the great and the good of early 1970s American celebrity - doesn't diminish in its capacity to impress. Noticeably dishevelled, there's Terry Southern, noted screenwriter of Dr Strangelove. There's Jackie Kennedy's sister, Princess Lee Radziwill, another member of the Capote party. But even in this esteemed company, it's perhaps the film itself that has a more notorious name than anyone present in its backstage scenes. Shot by the American photographer Robert Frank and his young colleague Danny Seymour, this - 16mm, in shaky black and white - is a film called Cocksucker Blues.</p> <p>In the 32 years since it was made, Cocksucker Blues has come to occupy a unique cultural place. In Don DeLillo's Underworld, a character speaks of loving \"the washed blue light of the film ... corruptive and ruinous, a beautiful tunnel blue\". In rock legend, it occupies a place as a record of the kind of bacchanalian excess - nodding out backstage, oral sex on private jets - that one has come to imagine the rock star demands as his right. In troublesome fact, it has continued to be an object of contention between Robert Frank and its subjects, the Rolling Stones. Even today, with a huge show of Frank's photography and a programme of his film work about to open at Tate Modern, the film is subject to stringent (and private) exhibition restrictions.</p> <p>It was, of course, not meant to be this way. Having used one of his photographs for the cover of their Exile On Main Street album, and been impressed by his landmark 1958 monograph The Americans, in 1972 the Stones commissioned the 48-year-old photographer to make a film of their triumphant return to concert performance in the United States. Three years previously, the Maysles brothers documentary team had witnessed the tragic denouement at Altamont Speedway of their concert ambitions for 1969. This time, things were going to be different: new record label (their own Rolling Stones records), new attitude (concerts running like clockwork, not turning into bloodbaths), new Rolling Stones. Celebrity journalists would record the band's progress. Meanwhile, a film of proceedings would satisfy both the desire for a record of the concerts, and Mick Jagger's film-making pretensions.</p> <p>\"One of the rules when making the movie was that none of the people in the Rolling Stones could say no,\" explains documentary director Paul Justman, then an editor on the film. \"If they said no, then Robert put the camera down and he left. There wouldn't be any anger or anything. It would be like, 'OK, you guys have given up and said no to me. Get someone else'.\"</p> <p>It was this policy, above all, which led to the unique quality and content of Cocksucker Blues. Certainly, the film did contain footage of the Rolling Stones playing some of their finest rock'n'roll, but this was shot by another crew. What Frank concentrated on was the periods of time between these shows: periods of time-killing, crotch-scratching and, frankly, boredom that can evidently also accompany the rock'n'roll life. There are notorious scenes - Keith Richards dumping a TV out of a window; a choreographed sexual encounter on board the Stones' jet, the so-called \"lapping tongue\" - but perhaps more representative of the content are two others. One where Keith attempts to order some fruit from room service. And another, where Mick Jagger films himself preparing, not to put too fine a point on it, to masturbate.</p> <p>\"Technically,\" says Susan Steinberg, who edited the film, \"it was a complete mess. There was a light leak in the [camera] magazine. Most people who saw this happening would have got the light leak fixed or got a new magazine, but Robert didn't. He didn't believe in that, and it's that attitude that's very prevalent in the film. It's down and dirty.\"</p> <p>An anecdote recorded by Terry Southern, meanwhile, recounts Frank's attempt to explain to Keith Richards exactly what it was he was after in the film.</p> <p>\"It's v\u00e9rit\u00e9,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Never mind v\u00e9rit\u00e9,\" the guitarist reportedly replied, \"I want poetry.\"</p> <p>This, after a fashion, is what he got. Assembled over the course of the next two years in Frank's loft on the Bowery, Cocksucker Blues slowly began to take shape. Bob Dylan would pop in to look at what they'd done. The team screened their material for interested celebrity parties at John Lennon's editing suite. Meanwhile, every two weeks, Mick Jagger would drop by to relish the relative anonymity afforded by the Lower East Side locale, eat Chinese food, and check on the progress of what was becoming a film with its own impressively perverse logic.</p> <p>Not everyone was so impressed with Frank's freewheeling pursuit of v\u00e9rit\u00e9. George Griffin, an animator roped in to provide the film's graffiti-style titles, remembers the time with a certain frustration.</p> <p>\"After having sprayed numerous titles, each increasingly more rough, spontaneous and 'authentic',\" he explains, \"Robert shot them while walking around, swooping, and sort of discovering them within the rubble of the roof. Only to discover, at dusk, that he had forgotten to load film into the camera.\"</p> <p>\"It wasn't commercial,\" concludes Paul Justman. \"It wasn't product. Robert doesn't make product. Whether it was good art or bad art - that's what he meant.\"</p> <p>Though supportive of the project as individuals, as an organisation the Rolling Stones were perhaps always going to have problems with Cocksucker Blues. Containing scenes where the band are surrounded by heavy drug use (in the credits, Danny Seymour is billed as \"Junkie Soundman\"), as well as heavily implying their own drug use, whatever the film was - staged documentary? Fiction, as a disclaimer in the titles implied? - it didn't fulfil a helpful function for a rock'n'roll band aiming to cross international borders as part of their day-to-day working life. Finishing the film completely being an expensive process, the Stones instead paid for a rough mix and a print, and then the cutting room was shut down. In the place of Cocksucker Blues, to little fanfare, they released the anodyne concert film Ladies And Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones.</p> <p>The trail of the movie went cold until several years later, when Susan Steinberg got a call from Mick Jagger. With Frank's permission, the pair were to clean up parts of the movie, with a view to a release. Keith Richards was then busted for drug possession in Toronto. The plan was shelved.</p> <p>Since then, the film has been left to work its way into the culture as a contraband artefact. Available to view only at restricted screenings - one of the provisos being that Frank must be present; the film must be viewed in the context of his, and not the Stones', oeuvre - it's otherwise a famous rock bootleg item, though one with a weighty pathos attached. While the film was being completed both Frank's daughter Andrea and his colleague Danny Seymour died, events the photographer would work through in subsequent films.</p> <p>Filled with moments of beauty and insight, meanwhile, Cocksucker Blues is left to add new depth to what would otherwise simply be a film about an excessive rock'n'roll junket. \"It's such a time capsule of what life was like behind the scenes in 1972,\" says Susan Steinberg. \"I've always wanted to get it released and seen.

  "<p>It's hell. It takes it all out of you. It nearly kills you ... It is more difficult than anything else that I have ever done - so I do it.\" Who said this? Matthew Pinsent after winning his fourth rowing gold medal in Athens this summer? Kelly Holmes after struggling back from injury to add the 800m to her 1500m gold? Roger Federer after retaining his Wimbledon title? Lance Armstrong after winning his sixth Tour de France? Jonny Wilkinson on his slow fight-back to form after surgery to his shoulder? The answer is Ernest Hemingway, talking about the rigours of writing world-beating, hairy-chested fiction, and his commitment to going mano-a-mano with a Remington typewriter, a Superman complex and a coldly perspiring demi-litre of Pastis every morning. </p> <p>\"See him now in his caf\u00e9,\" as Alfred Kazin described Hemingway's self-mythologising self-portrait in Paris in the 1920s, \"with his sweatshirt under his shirt, his blue-backed notebook to write in, his two pencils and his little pencil sharpener ... You think this is less of an American fable than Huck Finn on a raft, Ben Franklin waiting for his kite to be hit by lightning?\" </p> <p>His quota of words completed for the day, \"Papa\" was off rolling his shoulders and shadow-boxing round the Deux Magots and La Closerie des Lilas, shouting up his reputation as an outstanding pitcher and hitter on the high-school baseball team, a legendary college footballing ace, to anybody who was willing to listen. </p> <p>The truth, of course, was that Hemingway was nobody's first pick to be on their side. He was a shy boy, hampered by imperfect eyesight, overweight and awkwardly stumbling over his outsized feet. As a ballplayer, his brother Leicester once said, Ernest was a pretty studious reader. His mother used to find him poring over a book, and propose that he go out to play some baseball. \"Aw, mother,\" Ernest would wail, \"I pitch like a hen.\" </p> <p>For all this, and maybe because of it, no major American writer devoted more time and energy to the world of sport. One of his many biographers, Scott Donaldson, has noted that sports are referred to in 43 of Hemingway's first 49 stories, and in a number of cases (\"Big Two-Hearted River\", \"The Undefeated\", \"My Old Man\") are the meat of them. His journalism and correspondence frequently focused on bull-fighting, hunting, and fishing, as did three of his books - Death in the Afternoon, Green Hills of Africa, and The Old Man and the Sea. All he wanted, Hemingway wrote to Lillian Ross in May 1950, was to be champion of the world. </p> <p>He also wanted, like Walt Whitman and many of Hemingway's heirs in contemporary American letters, to be \"regarded as one of the roughs\". So he dined out on apocryphal stories about running away from home, about brawls in and out of the ring, about the tough south-side Chicago neighbourhoods he had frequented. But even in the days when he remained an unpublished writer, not everybody bought it. \"You are to remember that in Paris,\" Ford Madox Ford wrote at the end of that \"lost decade\", the 1920s, \"I have lived for years buried under mountains of middle-westerners who there find it necessary to assume the aspects, voices, accents and behaviours of cowboys crossed with liberal strains of prize-fighters and old-time Bowery toughs.\" </p> <p>In no other novelist was the division between the thinking man and the doing man, the writer and the sportsman, more pronounced than in Hemingway. As Donaldson writes in By Force of Will (1977), Hemingway was \"a man deeply divided against himself, with the most conspicuous split separating the writer, worker and man of feeling on the one hand, from the adventurer, sportsman and man of action on the other\". </p> <p>More than 40 years after Hemingway's death, it is a fracture that some of America's most prominent writers - John Updike, Philip Roth, Don DeLillo, Richard Ford - still feel impelled to try to heal in their fiction. David Foster Wallace, who once described himself as a \"near-great\" tennis junior, took it as the starting point for Infinite Jest (1996) and, at 1,079 pages, produced undisputedly the longest novel about tennis ever written. </p> <p>One of its earliest set-pieces features the young Enfield Tennis Academy prodigy, Hal Cadenza, up for interview by the admissions panel at the University of Arizona, where Wallace himself was a student. The deans on the panel are suspicious of Hal because of an apparent inconsistency between some verbal test scores that have shown him to be \"subnormal\", and the impossible braininess of his essays. It's the braininess that worries them rather than the dumbness which, on a primarily athletics-oriented campus, can be viewed as a \"revenue-raising asset\". </p> <p>As a 10-year-old, Hal's father had been lectured on the futility of book-learning by his own father: \"Those thoughts in your mind are just the sound of your head revving, and head is still just body, Jim.\" Revving heads (mainly Wallace's), and the ponk of tennis balls reverberate throughout Infinite Jest . As an exercise in the inversion of the old Hemingway clich\u00e9 - rather than the writer who thinks he's lean and mean and a bit of a bruiser, the athlete who is a brain - it is berserkly, and sometimes brilliantly, cerebral. </p> <p>Infinite Jest's most obvious antecedents are the postmodern metafictions of John Barth, Thomas Pynchon and Robert Coover, in particular Coover's The Universal Baseball Association (1968). DeLillo and Roth wrote early, loosely experimental novels that also dealt in a surreal-satirical way with sport. Both DeLillo's End Zone (1972), which was about gridiron football and nuclear fission, and The Great American Novel (1973), which saw Roth cutting loose in the tale of America's only homeless big-league baseball team, were the antithesis of everything the virulently anti-abstractionist Hemingway thought good writing should be. \"Artist, art, artistic!\" he was once heard to rant. \"Can't we ever hear the last of that stuff?\" </p> <p>As its title indicates, The Great American Novel was intended as a commentary on the fervid competition between Roth, Norman Mailer, Bernard Malamud and their contemporaries in the 50s and 60s. An extended scat on winning - \"Oh, you really can't say enough good things about it ... Win hands down, win going away, win by a landslide, win by accident - you just can't beat it, however you slice it. Winning is the tops\" - is obviously meant to be a satirical take on the infamous letter Papa sent to the publisher Charles Scribner in 1949: \"Tried for Mr Turgenieff first and it wasn't too hard. Tried for Mr Maupassant and it took four of the best stories to beat him . ... Mr Henry James I would just thumb him once the first time he grabbed then hit him once where he had no balls.\" </p> <p>Roth hammers home the point by having \"Hemingway\" send a telegraph message in The Great American Novel: \"To Messrs Hawthorne, Melville, Twain and James, in care of the Department of Literatoor, Vassar College, New York. Dear Illustrious Dead: The Great American Novelist, c'est moi. Signed, Papa.\" </p> <p>The irony here is that The Great American Novel is as testosterone-charged and swaggeringly, preposterously ambitious as any of the pumped-up works by rival writers that it tries to take down. Al Alvarez touched on a further irony in these pages a few weeks ago. Writing about Roth's scandalous success with Portnoy's Complaint , Alvarez noted that \"when it was published in 1969 it seemed to epitomise the anarchic spirit of the decade. Maybe it did, but the author himself (b.1933) was a product of the 1950s, the last generation of well-behaved, sternly educated children who believed in high culture and high principles ... Portnoy was considered outrageous when it appeared, but the real outrage was Roth's and he was outraged because he couldn't help being a good boy however much he yearned to be bad.\" </p> <p>DeLillo (b.1933) and Updike (b.1932) also came of age in the clean-cut 50s; Richard Ford was born a decade later (1944) but he too grew up through the jutting-jawed Eisenhower years. With Roth and Wallace, these writers have produced some of the landmark American novels of recent times. And Independence Day (Ford), Underworld (DeLillo), American Pastoral (Roth), Infinite Jest and even Updike's Rabbit tetralogy are all, in one way or another and to greater or lesser degrees, about sport. </p> <p>Images of sportsmen and sportswomen have become swarmingly ubiquitous in the electronic society of the image in which we live. It is sports stars, we are told, rather than Hollywood or music industry figures, who can swing next month's election for George W Bush. At every campaign stop-over, local baseball heroes and National Football League Hall of Famers are wheeled out to endorse the president with a sporting metaphor: \"He's made the right calls time and again and he's got the scorecard to prove it!\" Cue high-fives, pseudo-military salutes and manly bear-hugs. </p> <p>But only 80 years ago even baseball, now regarded as the American national pastime, was considered to be slightly disreputable. In many ways it took a writer, Ring Lardner, in his daily newspaper column and, later, his phenomenally popular syndicated short stories, to make it respectable. Lardner wrote his baseball column for five years in Chicago between 1908 and 1913, and continued to cover big games until the early 20s, though he became somewhat disillusioned after the so-called Black Sox scandal of 1919, when the Chicago team contrived with a betting syndicate to lose the World Series. The legendary \"fix\" has been immortalised by a reference to it in The Great Gatsby (1925); Scott Fitzgerald and Lardner had become friends and drinking partners - two of America's \"deepest drinkers\", Lardner liked to joke - while living in Great Neck, Long Island, in 1923, and Fitzgerald introduced Lardner to his (and Hemingway's) editor, Maxwell Perkins. But they never succeeded in persuading Lardner to write a novel, or, for that matter, as David Lodge has written, \"to put his stories before the public with the dignity appropriate to a modern literary master\". </p> <p>Writing in 1925 in praise of Lardner's experiments with the American vernacular, Virginia Woolf concluded that \"it is no coincidence that the best of Mr Lardner's stories are about games, for one may guess that Mr Lardner's interest in games has solved one of the most difficult problems of the American writer; it has given him a clue, a centre, a meeting place for the diverse activities of people whom a vast continent isolates, whom no tradition controls. Games give him what society gives his English brother.\" </p> <p>Lardner died of TB brought on by excessive drinking in 1933, aged 48, and when Fitzgerald wrote his friend's obituary, he allowed his frustration to show. He traced Lardner's \"cynical attitude towards his work\" back to his youthful infatuation with baseball: \"During those years, when most men of promise achieve an adult education, if only in the school of war, Ring moved in the company of a few dozen illiterates playing a boy's game. A boy's game, with no more possibilities in it than a boy could master, a game bounded by walls which kept out novelty or danger, change or adventure.\" </p> <p>Lardner came from a prosperous mid-western farming family, and enjoyed a comfortable, almost idyllic upbringing. He trained his ear for bar-room slang and lively gutter language travelling with the \"illiterates\" of the White Sox baseball team. Spectator sports, although still in their infancy, were a ready route out of poverty, then as now, for new Americans, and locker rooms became a forcing ground for the improvised, hybridised kind of English that Lardner started putting into his stories and Hemingway wasn't alone in picking up on. He inscribed a copy of Death in the Afternoon (1932), \"To Ring Lardner, from his early imitator and always admirer\". But this didn't stop Papa rounding on the multitude of impersonators of his early, plain-spoken fictions. \"You bastards have stolen my prose style\", Roth has him explode in The Great American Novel . \"Every shithead sportswriter in America has stolen my style and then gone and fucked it up so bad that I can't even use it anymore without becoming sick to my stomach.\" </p> <p>In an essay for the New York Times 40 years ago, the British football writer Brian Glanville (author of the football novel The Rise of Gerry Logan) joined Orwell in comparing the rich American vernacular with the thin gruel of standard English and \"the deadness of middle-class speech\". Cricket, Glanville noted, \"a haven for the belletrist and the literary romantic, has yet to produce a single piece of serious fiction about the professional game\", and that remains the case today. The rough world of northern Rugby League, on the other hand, at the time Glanville was writing, had just produced David Storey's This Sporting Life (1960), a novel by a miner's son who became an art student, and travelled north every weekend to play for Leeds Reserves. It had an authenticity, Glanville believed, which was guaranteed by Storey's own experience; no stranger to the Rugby League milieu and Yorkshire mining background could have hoped to write it. </p> <p>By putting the narrator of his breakthrough novel The Sportswriter (1986) into the trade of the title, Ford encouraged readers of his earlier, \"dirty realist\" stories to expect a book fetid with the smells of wintergreen and embrocation and astringent. And though, in the course of the novel, Frank Bascombe does travel to Detroit to profile a former star footballer who is now a paraplegic, and visits the offices of the magazine that employs him in New York, The Sportswriter is a novel that stays resolutely in anti-heroic mode. It is virtually all interior monologue; a (frequently very funny) meditation on the routine and the mundane, with numerous digressions on what Bascombe has learned about life-through-sport. \"Athletes, by and large, are people who are happy to let their actions speak for them, happy to be what they do. As a result, when you talk to an athlete, as I do all the time ...he's never likely to feel the least bit divided, or alienated, or one ounce of existential dread.\" </p> <p>This patent untruth - which in many ways is the subject of Roth's American Pastoral, the story of an all-American, sun-blessed athlete, patriotic, dutiful, simple-seeming, bland as butter, who turns out to be wracked by uninmaginable existential dread - is reiterated by DeLillo in End Zone: \"Football players are simple folk. Whatever complexities, whatever dark politics of the human mind, the heart - the football player travels the straightest of lines. His thoughts are wholesomely commonplace, his actions uncomplicated by history, enigma, holocaust or dream.\" </p> <p>By the time of Independence Day (1995), Ford's follow-up novel, his sportswriter Bascombe has moved on to become a buyer and seller of property and father of an estranged, violently delinquent son. To try to heal their relationship, and acting on something he has said in the earlier novel, that \"talking about sport ... is a pretty innocent part of people, and talking has the effect of bringing us all together\", Bascombe sets out with Paul on a \"hombre-to-hombre\" tour of all the sporting Halls of Fame they can fit into the July 4 weekend. The trip ends in near-disaster when Paul beans himself - maybe accidentally, maybe not - by putting his head in the way of a ball being pelted out of a pitching machine in Cooperstown, NY. </p> <p>Ford, who spent the first 18 years of his life \"unlettered as a porch monkey\", is a self-identified sports nut. In \"The Three Kings\", an appreciation of Hemingway, Faulkner and Fitzgerald, he wrote that \"Some boys, alas, do not come to serious reading, nor God knows to serious writing, precisely like hounds to round steak. Though, then again, special boys sometimes do.\" </p> <p>Ford is a southerner, from Jackson, Mississippi. Updike, Roth and DeLillo are all from the north-eastern United States. Updike and Roth have described their home neighbourhoods so insistently, and occasionally rapturously, over the years that their work contains pictures of Shillington, Pennsylvania and the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey, so complete that, as Joyce once remarked of Dublin, \"if the city one day suddenly disappeared from the earth it could be reconstructed out of my book\". </p> <p>DeLillo grew up in the Bronx, but it wasn't until Underworld (1997), his 11th novel, that he approached material which was clearly autobiographical. In the closing section, set in the early 1950s, Nick Shay, the main protagonist, is depicted as a rough-tongued delinquent, helling around with girls and drink and the local poolroom hoodlums. But the close reader may suspect that it is Nick's studious, chess-playing brother who offers a truer picture of the authorial alter-ego. </p> <p>Little Matty Shay is \"pale with an indoor passion\", like Dale, the computer nerd in Updike's Roger's Version . (Like, in fact, Seldon Wishnow, the little loser who lives downstairs from the Roths in The Plot Against America . Seldon throws a ball like a girl; all he likes to do is play chess. He wants to be a friend of Philip's and walk to school with him; Philip can't wait to see the back of him.) </p> <p>Updike has written marvellously about sport, especially golf, in articles and stories. But until he was an adult, the series of afflictions he enumerates in Self-Consciousness (1989) - psoriasis, asthma, claustrophobia, hydrophobia, arachnophobia, insomnia, poor teeth, a tendency to choke and a spectacular stammer - prevented him having much of a sporting life. The four Rabbit novels, published at intervals of roughly a decade between 1960 and 1990, are of course about a great deal more than Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom's regret about his finest hour as a star of the college basketball team being way behind him: they are about race and terrorist attack, the legacy of Vietnam, the sexual revolution, the disintegration of the American landscape and the apparently unstoppable, runaway expansion of what Roth has called \"the indigenous American berserk\". </p> <p>But the 1,500 pages of the tetralogy begin and end with Harry doing what he has always done when he wants to feel most within himself: sneakered-up, running and leaping with a ball. \"That tan pebbled roundness, the smooth seams between, the little circlet for taking the air valve.\" It is Harry's last conscious moment before a heart-attack kills him on-court. \"A big pebbled ball that wants to fly.\" </p> <p>\"What is it with ballplayers?\" Martin Amis wonders in Money (1985), as the crapulous John Self is being humiliated in a game of tennis by an athletic Hollywood type. \"What is it about roundness that they understand better than we do? The world is round. They understand that too.\" </p> <p>A close, almost forensic, even fetishistic attention to the plastic fact of the ball - its size, weight, consistency, colour, texture, resiliency and liveliness - is a striking feature of all these books, all written of course by men. Ford does it in Independence Day (a baseball is the object that has almost killed Bascombe's son). Wallace does it with \"a dirty green dead old\" Slazenger in Infinite Jest: \"Perfectly round. Even distribution of mass. But empty inside ... Nothing in there but evacuated air that smells like a kind of rubber hell.\" Roth does it over several pages in The Great American Novel, and then again over several more pages, a few chapters further on, but takes 30 years to tell us, in American Pastoral , what he might have been getting at: that the \"Moby Dick-coloured\" balls in the museum showcase are nostalgic remnants of an era when \"orderliness [was] a natural condition, daily living a simple story tangibly unfolding, a deeply unagitating story, the fluctuations predictable, the combat containable, the surprises satisfying\". </p> <p>In Mao II , DeLillo's writer-hero Bill Gray lies awake at night \"going down the batting order of the 1938 Cleveland Indians\": \"I do batting orders in my head all the time. And I've been trying to write toward that kind of innocence ever since ... There hasn't been a moment since those days when I've felt nearly so good.\" </p> <p> Underworld , the book DeLillo wrote after Mao II , has been called America's great love song to baseball. In the novel, collectors compete to possess the ball that won a legendary game played in New York in 1951. They want to possess the ball - \"this little spheroid fact\" - so that they can possess a moment pre-dating television when people \"did something great just by being there ... - decades ago when things were not replayed and worn out and run down and used up before midnight of the first day\". The ball has come into Nick Shay's keeping, at a price: $34,500. He keeps it on a bookshelf in the bedroom, \"wedged in a corner between straight-up books and slanted books, tented under books, unceremoniously\". On nights he can't sleep, he weighs the ball in his hand, examining the seams, the rough spots and stains on the horsehide. \"This is the thing that will pulse in his brain come old age and double vision and dizzy spells - the surge sensation, the leap of people already standing, that bolt of noise and joy when the ball went in.\" </p> <p>There is an echo of Fitzgerald here, and Tom Buchanan in Gatsby, \"who would drift on forever, seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game\". An echo of Fitzgerald himself who, until the end of his life, would mingle with the crowds in the big university stadia and eventually died of a heart attack annotating an article in the Princeton Alumni Weekly. In his copy of the magazine, a pencil line still runs wildly down a page of a story about football. </p> <p>Part of the lure of Ivy League matches for Fitzgerald was that, in their liveries and traditions, they seemed timeless. \"Baseball's time is seamless and invisible,\" the game's chief laureate, Roger Angell, has written, \"a bubble within which players move at exactly the same pace and rhythms as all their predecessors. This is the way the game was played in our youth, and in our fathers' youth, and even back then - back in the country days - there must have been the feeling that time could be stopped.\" </p> <p>In this way it's like reading; it's like writing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Gordon Burn's book about George Best will be published by Faber and Faber next year.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Heroes: Saviours, Traitors and Supermen</strong><br>by Lucy Hughes-Hallett<br> 624pp, Fourth Estate, \u00a325 </p> <p>\"The history of the world is the biography of great men,\" declared Thomas Carlyle in his Lectures on Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History (1840). Carlyle tried to prove his point by giving rhapsodic accounts of the lives and influence of a bizarre mix of prophets, poets and rulers (Odin, Mohammed, Dante, Shakespeare, Luther, Burns, Johnson, Rousseau, Cromwell and Napoleon), whom he saw as the motors of human history. Most of us would find it pretty difficult now to call someone \"my hero\" without putting on the voice of Popeye's Olive Oyl and doing a lot of batting of our eyelids to show we don't really mean what we're saying. Democracies have problems with heroes, and democracies in which most people believe that human character is principally fashioned by environment find it hard to believe in the existence of, let alone to worship, the kind of overwhelming natural brilliance that Carlyle found in his heroes. </p> <p>Lucy Hughes-Hallett knows all this and treads a canny line in constructing her new canon of heroes to supplant Carlyle's. She offers short and sparky biographies of eight men, all of whom had troubled relations with their political rulers: Achilles (for Homer still the best of the Achaeans despite his rebelliousness), Alcibiades (the charismatic and deceitful freelance Athenian general), Cato (the priggish defender of the Roman Republic against the rise of Julius Caesar), El Cid (the glamorous mercenary who resisted Muslim incursions into Spain), Francis Drake (the pirate-cum-imperial voyager), Wallenstein (the one-man military-industrial complex who led the imperial army in the thirty years war), Garibaldi (the engagingly lecherous, swashbuckling liberator of Italy) and finally, and all too briefly, the wily Odysseus. </p> <p>Her selection of heroes is skewed towards military leaders: there is no Christ or Sir Thomas More to alleviate the swashing of buckles, or to indicate that heroes can be people of principle rather than simple men of action. The closest she comes to a patient and resistant hero is Cato, who withstood many trials in his vain attempt to protect the Roman Republic, including being pelted with dung. But she tells the life stories of all these men (and yes, they are all hairy-chested blokes) with vivacity and wit. Although she does not believe with Carlyle that the biographies of Great Men make history happen, she is extremely good at using the events of her heroes' lives to evoke a larger swath of historical events. The chapter on Wallenstein does as much as anyone could in the space to make the thirty years war comprehensible and interesting, and people who want to know a bit about fifth-century BC Athens or about the unification of Italy could do a lot worse than read the chapters on Alcibiades and Garibaldi. </p> <p>She also has a sharp eye for the kind of anecdote that can bring history to life. Apparently one Spaniard got so carried away showing what he would do to Francis Drake that he shot a bystander dead. And there is a glorious cameo appearance by the Irishman John Peard, who, when asked why he was fighting with Garibaldi (in his tweeds), declared that he respected Italian independence, \"but I am also very fond of shooting\". He was, apparently, sometimes taken for Garibaldi himself, and the ladies all swooned over him in place of the real hero. The chapter on Garibaldi also almost offers the book's only female hero: his first wife Anita stood by him while bullets whistled through her hat, and was bowled over not only by him but also by cannon-balls. They had met in South America, where Garibaldi had said \"You must be mine\" (as he remarks \"my impudence was magnetic\"), and she was. He tried more or less the same line with his second wife (Anita could not stick the life of a Garibaldina for long, and died in 1849). He was less lucky second time around: the beautiful young Giuseppina Raimondi, it transpired, had had a sexual career almost as colourful as Garibaldi's own before their marriage. Unfortunately Garibaldi learnt about this immediately after the wedding and, being a hero with traditional male beliefs about female promiscuity, never spoke to her again. </p> <p>It's a witty and readable book, but it does have problems with its argument. The basic idea is that the particular kind of heroes that Hughes-Hallett is interested in are men of (in her excellent phrase) \"seditionary greatness\". They're too big, too wild, too dangerous. They fight at one moment for their leader or regime, and then turn against them - indeed several of them, including El Cid and Alcibiades, turn and turn about in their political allegiances. A final chapter introduces a more sinister note: it shows how D'Annunzio, Mussolini and Hitler manipulated hero-worship to suit their own ends, and argues that by contrast Leopold Bloom, the humdrum democratic Odyssean hero of James Joyce's Ulysses, is far more appealing to our age. As Hughes-Hallett puts it, with a distinct hint of a wrist-slap, hero-worship \"allows worshippers to abnegate responsibility, looking to the great man for salvation or for fulfilment that they should more properly be working to accomplish for themselves\". So don't sit there watching replays of Beckham's free kicks; get out there and kick a ball yourself until you can bend it with the best. </p> <p>As well as this thoroughly decent strand of liberal-democratic horror at what a hero can do to a state and at what hero-worship can do to the soul, this book also has a strong thread of soft-core Nietzschean wonder at the superman running through it. These two strands don't sit comfortably together, and it is often not clear whether we're being invited to wonder at the natural charisma of heroic individuals or to deplore the ruses by which heroes trick people into admiring them. </p> <p>To make up for this problem with her argument, Hughes-Hallett has to throw in a heavy dose of comparisons between her subjects. Sometimes the effect is a bit like the first-century Greek historian Plutarch, whose Parallel Lives compared the actions of a famous Roman with those of an equally famous Greek counterpart. But most of the time the comparisons stand in for a clear argument about what really might be good or bad about heroes. We are told far too often that \"As Cato\" stood up for the state, \"so\" Garibaldi, or Drake, or Alcibiades or whoever did the same; or \"As Achilles\" sulked in his tent \"so Wallenstein\" retired to his private chamber to indulge in dark thoughts about the emperor. There are moments when these comparisons are so strained that they recall dear old Fluellen in Shakespeare's Henry V , who tries to prove that Henry V (a fellow Welshman) is as heroic as Alexander the Great, but can't muster anything much that they have in common except \"there is a River in Macedon, and there is also moreover a river at Monmouth... and there is salmons in both\". </p> <p>If Hughes-Hallett is finally unclear about whether she loves or loathes her heroes, or what they all have in common, this is not simply her fault. We all have a problem with heroes. We want them so badly that we keep inventing new ones, and yet our political culture tells us that naturally exceptional individuals should not be either possible or desirable, because we are all equal and equally the products of our environment. In that respect this book suits our times as much as Carlyle's did his: instead of his unashamed and defiant hero-worship, it offers the guilty pleasure of wondering at the undemocratic wildness of eight great men. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Colin Burrow is a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and is the editor of Shakespeare's Complete Sonnets and Poems for the Oxford Shakespeare.</p>",
  "<p>About a year ago, I decided to join a class on the mystical poems of Jalal al-Din Rumi. Years before, studying Persian at Cambridge, I had read some of Rumi's 13th-century poems and remember warming to his harmonious view of the cosmos and his benevolent, highly personal Islamic faith. I told friends in Tehran, where I live, that I was looking for a teacher. </p> <p>A friend, Maryam, promised to introduce me to Mr B, her Rumi teacher for the past five years. A few days later, she reported that Mr B was reluctant to have a British journalist in his class. I was dismayed but not surprised. Many Iranians regard journalists as unreliable, and resent the British for their history of meddling, spying and otherwise obnoxious behaviour in Iran. It took several months before Maryam convinced Mr B to relent. </p> <p>In January, Mr B started a weekly class, to be held in the home of some people called Roshan, and I was invited to take part. It is quite common for educated Iranians to host classes in their houses. These classes are a small rebellion against the state's efforts to regulate the way people think and act: 25 years after the 1979 revolution, it is impossible to hold an intimate and relaxed poetry class in a public building. The authorities might balk at an assembly of men and women. The women would be unable to remove their hijabs, the Islamic head and body cover that must, according to Iranian law, be worn in public. Eavesdroppers might monitor the class for subversive political undertones. </p> <p>A few days before the first class, I visited a friend, Ali Dehbashi, in the offices of Bukhara, the literary magazine he edits. He is the editor of a collection of essays about Rumi, one of several recent Iranian books on the subject. Since the 1990s, he told me, Iran has been experiencing a Rumi revival. The poems, he said, are popular among \"people who want to keep their God\" but are \"not excessively religious\". Dehbashi is not surprised by the depth and duration of the revival. \"Historically,\" he told me, \"mysticism has arisen in response to doctrinal pressure.\" </p> <p>After taking power, Iran's cleric-politicians shut down lodges where mystical Islam was promoted, and silenced mystic holy men, called sheikhs, who disapproved of linking religion with worldly power. The clerics encouraged people to follow the recommendations of the most senior ayatollahs, rather than their own faith and conscience. </p> <p>One evening, I drove from my home in Elahiyeh, in north Tehran, to a township full of high-rise blocks. A middle-aged woman opened the door of a flat on the 14th floor, and introduced herself as Mrs Roshan. She ushered me into a sitting room lined with straight-backed chairs, and introduced me to her husband. She gave me tea and kak, a kind of millefeuille, and we looked out at the lights of neighbouring buildings. </p> <p>The other participants started arriving. The men hung up their coats and greeted the others, placing their right hands over their hearts and making barely perceptible bows. The women shed their headscarves and came in rearranging or patting down their hair. There was a married couple whose solicitous mutual regard betrayed them as newlyweds. There was a young woman with a plaster on her nose; and there was a young man, pale and brainy looking, who helped himself to a surprising quantity of kak. I learned later that we would have to pay around \u00a33 per class, which is beyond the means of most Iranians. We all held copies of the Masnavi-ye ma'navi. The title means the spiritual rhyming couplets. They were composed in the 13th century by Jalal al-Din Muhammad b. Muhammad al-Balkhi. </p> <p>Western readers know him as Rumi, from his long residence in Rum, so called because it had been the heart of the eastern Roman (or Byzantine) empire. (Rum corresponds roughly to Anatolia, the landmass that dominates modern Turkey.) He was born in 1207 in what is now Tajikistan, but his family moved west to Konya, the capital of the Seljuk Sultanate in Rum, when he was a boy. After receiving theological training in Syria, Rumi returned to Konya, where he achieved modest fame as an Islamic legal expert and preacher. </p> <p>In 1244, an ageing mystic, Shams of Tabriz, arrived in Konya and struck up a rapport with Rumi. The two men spent several months in seclusion and Shams guided Rumi towards an ecstatic realisation of God. Shams taught Rumi to whirl, accompanied by music or an invocation. In 1247, Shams disappeared. Grief-stricken, Rumi composed odes that ascribe divine qualities to him. In the late 1250s or early 1260s Rumi started his great narrative and didactic work, the Masnavi-ye ma'navi. He is thought to have spent at least a decade intermittently composing its 25,000 lines before his death in 1273. </p> <p>The Masnavi contains thousands of stories and anecdotes, many of them drawn from the Qur'an, interspersed with Rumi's advice. Rumi's poetry can transport the reader to a kind of rapture. However, he warned against the blinding effects of outer beauty, and urged his readers to seek the wisdom inside his wit. \"The letters are the vessel,\" he says in the Masnavi ; \"therein the meaning is [contained] like water.\" I know people who say that they have grasped this meaning and been changed by it. </p> <p>Mr B is a man of medium height, with thick grey hair and a beard. When I first saw him, he was wearing pressed corduroy trousers and a long woollen waistcoat over a white shirt. When he smiled, his eyes shone darkly. He began the class with the words, \"In the name of God, the compassionate and merciful\". </p> <p>Although the Masnavi addresses Muslims, it is tolerant of other faiths. In Mr B's telling, it treads a pragmatic path between the competing ideas of predestination and free will. Rumi rejects the extreme asceticism of other mystical traditions. \"If you hoard a coin in your pocket,\" Mr B told us, \"it is material. As soon as you give it, out of charity, it becomes spiritual.\" </p> <p>In an ode, Rumi describes love between human beings as a bridge to heavenly love. As someone who is married and recently became a father, I was reassured by this. Although he was observant of Islamic law, Mr B told us, Rumi believed that an observant person who is ignorant of Islam's spirit is \"more dangerous than an irreligious person\". In the Masnavi , Rumi hints that he can only communicate some parts of his awesome message; most people are incapable of understanding the whole. Mr B seemed to share Rumi's spiritual elitism. He referred disparagingly to \"the common people\", for whom \"only religious ordinances are important\". </p> <p>The classes developed a pattern. I would sit on a seat with my back to the window. The brainy-looking young man, a newly qualified civil engineer called Ali, sat on my left. The seat opposite was occupied by a middle-aged woman called Mrs Malayeri. She usually wore jeans and a T-shirt. </p> <p>For the first hour-and-a-half, Mr B would speak and we would take notes. (I am slow and clumsy at writing Persian, and would copy from Ali the bits that I had missed). Then there would be a break for tea and fruit. During the break, I would sometimes talk to Ali or to Mrs Malayeri, who is a yoga teacher. During the second, shorter part of the class, Mr B would read from the text, quoting in Arabic from the Qur'an, and from other Iranian poets. </p> <p>Once, while Mr B quoted and his eyes shone, I remembered that Mrs Malayeri had told me that poetry flows in the veins of Iranians, even those who are not bookish. I looked up. The girl with the plaster over her nose had closed her eyes. Mrs Malayeri was smiling. I smiled too. It was what Rumi had warned against, the blinding effect of beauty. The class ended joyfully. We thanked Mr B. </p> <p>The woman with the plaster asked if anyone intended to drive in the direction of Elahiyeh. I offered her a ride. She introduced herself as Simin and added that she hoped my wife would not mind my taking her home. As we walked to my car, Simin switched from Persian to English. She told me she was planning a PhD the sis, and that she had attended primary school in Leeds. She taught English at a language institute. </p> <p>For the next several weeks, I took Simin home after class and we would talk. She was hungry for information about literary life in Britain and the US. She complained that the London Review of Books was hard to find in Iran. Her favourite poets were the Metaphysicals; she loved Donne. </p> <p>Simin has no recollection of life before the revolution. In schools, on TV, in speeches made by politicians, the authorities have tried to mould young Iranians' view of themselves and their history. But she attends a weekly class on a great epic poem, Firdawsi's Shahnameh , whose roots lie in the mythology and legends of pre-Islamic Iran. For Simin, reading the Shahnameh is a way of reminding herself of Iran's \"glorious heritage\". </p> <p>Talking to Simin, I realised that poems like the Masnavi provide refuge not only from the Islamic Republic's interpretation of Islam, but also from aspects of western culture. Simin referred to a western-style consumer mentality that Iran's middle classes have embraced. The Masnavi , she said, teaches that \"if you want spiritual calm, you won't achieve it by building up material possessions\". </p> <p>One night, as Simin and I approached Elahiyeh, we passed a young woman in the street with a plaster on her nose. According to a plastic surgeon that I met a several months ago, Tehran boasts more nose jobs than most western cities. I took the opportunity of asking Simin about her own nose. Given the mystical verses that we were reading - verses that value the content of a thing, not its form - I wondered whether Simin regretted her vanity. \"In the 1990s, for the first time in so many years, we were exposed to western products and magazines, and people learned to be aware of their appearance,\" she said. Simin exempted herself from this category; her nose, she told me, had been operated on for medical reasons. </p> <p>Over the coming weeks, we read a story in the Masnavi about a king who falls in love with a handmaiden. When he brings her back to court, she falls ill. The king prostrates himself in a mosque and, entering a trance-like state, is warned of the impending arrival of a wise physi cian. The following day, an old man presents himself at court. </p> <p>Mr B explained that the king represents the seeker of spiritual perfection. The old man is his \"guide\". Their meeting mirrors the epiphany of Rumi's encounter with Shams. \"That was the greatest divine gift,\" Mr B said. \"Shams's physical aspect was human, but in reality he was something else.\" Mr B meant that Shams had been infused with God's spirit. </p> <p>According to Mr B, the journey to spiritual perfection must be accomplished from within. \"It's only by knowing yourself that you can come to know God.\" Mr B alluded to Rumi's view, expressed in the Masnavi, that a person who blindly imitates another person is like an ape. I thought of an Iranian academic, Hashem Aghajari. In a speech he made in 2002, he compared the unquestioning emulation by Shias of senior ayatollahs to the mimicry of monkeys. Aghajari was sentenced to death for this and other comments that were deemed insulting to the clergy and Islam. (The judiciary recently bowed to international pressure and commuted his sentence to a prison term.) Mr B quoted Saadi, another great Iranian poet, \"How can I thank God enough for the divine gift of being too weak to oppress?\" Everyone broke into smiles. It was a moment of subversion, a delightful moment. </p> <p>One evening after class, I approached Mr B and asked if he had ever known someone like the old man in the story. He replied that when he was a boy, growing up in the eastern province of Khorasan, he had read the poetry of a mystic shepherd called Baba Taher. Years later, as a student in Tehran, Mr B had felt an irresistible pull towards a man who passed him in the street. The man was a sheikh, and Mr B told him that he wanted to be his student. The sheikh said, \"I've known you since you started reading the poems of Baba Taher.\" </p> <p>I had heard that the Islamic republic had relaxed its hostility to mystic lodges. I tried to picture Mr B in such a lodge, spiritually inebriated, but the image was irreconcilable with the mellow, cerebral man I knew. Mr B told me, \"For every 100 people I teach, perhaps three are able to cross over into another kind of consciousness.\" </p> <p>Over the next few weeks, we inched through the story of the king and the handmaiden. The old man determines that the maiden is lovesick for an ironmonger in a distant city. On his instructions, the king uses promises of wealth and advancement to entice the ironmonger to come to court. United with her lover, the maiden recovers, only for the old man to feed the ironmonger a potion that debilitates him. The ironmonger becomes ugly and the handmaiden stops loving him. In the end, the ironmonger dies. </p> <p>According to Mr B, the story relates a struggle inside us - the handmaiden is worldly love that has become \"unhealthy\" because of its reliance on physical infatuation. She is cured when her lover loses his looks. The ironmonger represents our covetous and materialistic self. His death is \"a triumph over the devil in all of us\". </p> <p>During the break, I took my tea over to Mrs Malayeri. I asked her how she had become interested in Rumi. It goes back, she told me, to a personal calamity that happened shortly after the revolution (she did not tell me what), when she sought solace in Indian mysticism, Zen Buddhism and yoga. After six or seven years of study, and two visits to India, Malayeri regretted that she was ignoring sources of wisdom in her own culture. \"I asked myself, 'Malayeri! Where are you?'\" </p> <p>I asked if she had voted in February's parliamentary elections. She raised and lowered her eyebrows very quickly - a wordless Iranian \"no\". </p> <p>In 1997 and 2001, Iranians turned out in massive numbers to elect Mohammad Khatami as their president. But Khatami's plan to spread democracy was thwarted by a conservative elite made up of a few dozen clerics and their supporters in the judiciary, armed forces and media. They jailed his supporters, banned reformist newspapers and vetoed legislation. </p> <p>In the spring, Khatami inaugurated the annual Tehran book fair. Khatami is a bookish cleric. (He is not an ayatollah, which means \"sign of God\" in Arabic, but has a lower rank, hojjat-al-Islam, which means \"proof of Islam\".) He is a former culture minister and once headed the national library. After coming to power, he lifted many artistic restrictions and put a stop to the extra-judicial execution of intellectuals. </p> <p>Shortly after the inauguration, I had a rendezvous at the book fair with Ali, from Mr B's class. Of all my classmates, Ali intrigued me the most. Behind his shy exterior, I sensed a young man's wilfulness. Ali had told me that he had always been expected to follow a family tradition and become a civil engineer. But at university in the northern town of Rasht, he developed a passion for literature and philosophy. The other engineering students made fun of his bookishness. After graduating, Ali returned to Tehran and started a part-time degree in Iranian literature. He longed to give up engineering and devote himself to books. </p> <p>Ali was standing at an entrance to Tehran's open-air convention centre. At a refreshment stall next to a pavilion that specialised in religious books, some women in chadors, unbuttoned lengths of black cloth, held books of Islamic ordinances and sucked iced lollipops. Seminarians in gowns and turbans compared purchases. Ali and I dawdled in the English language pavilion, where a young clientele perused dictionaries, novels and DIY guides . </p> <p>Unlike his conservative opponents, Khatami does not fear pluralism in dress, beliefs or books. During his presidency, the book fair has grown and diversified. It has become a showcase for books that, before 1997, would not have cleared the censors. Next summer, Khatami's second term of office will come to an end, and the clerical elite will ensure that only conservatives may stand to replace him. The 2006 book fair may have a different feel. </p> <p>Ali and I bought chips and ate them sitting on a lawn. Ali was preoccupied by his professional dilemma. If he abandoned engineering, his family would be disappointed. It would mean material uncertainty. On the other hand, he longed to turn his back on a society that judges people \"not on what you think, but what you have\". I asked if the Masnavi was having an effect. He said: \"I've come to the conclusion that Rumi has something other than poetic power... he sees something that others do not.\" </p> <p>At our next class, Ali told me that he had consulted Mr B about his dilemma. Mr B had advised him to give up engineering only when he was certain that he could live with the consequences. Ali seemed relieved that Mr B had not pressured him to make an immediate decision. \"Things may be clearer,\" he said, \"when we've finished the Masnavi .\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Christopher de Bellaigue's book In the Rose Garden of the Martyrs: A Memoir of Iran is published by HarperCollins, price \u00a320.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The final 70-character instalment of the text-message novel Out of the Fortress buzzed into thousands of mobile phones last week, leaving readers wondering what the author, Qian Fuzhang, will do next to push back the technological boundaries of publishing. Last month, this very modern Chinese tale of adultery, illegality and immorality appeared on tiny screens in twice-daily instalments.</p> <p>It wasn't the first time the Guandong-based author had shunned book stores. His last work, Red Horse, was published online. In a book market notorious for piracy, it's a smart move to use the latest technology to control distribution. Lucrative, too. Even before the latest text message novel came out, the portal Hurray.com gave Qian (whose real name is He Xingnian) an advance of 180,000 renminbi (\u00a313,000) - a decent sum in China, where writers are notoriously poorly paid.</p> <p>The new media does have its limits, however. Including spaces and punctuation, the latest tale was a mere 4,200 characters long - making it a very short short story. Qian said he was only thinking of his readers. \"In this age, with a flood of information, I thought it was cruel to force readers to wrestle with a 200,000-word book,\" he told the New York Times.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Despite the marketing blitz that surrounded the Chinese version of Bill Clinton's My Life in September, the book can already be found at half-price in many Beijing bookstores. This might have something to do with an impressively astute counterfeiting operation, which not only had an unofficial translation of the biography out before the official version, but also tailored the contents for the domestic audience.</p> <p>The \"enhancements\" included Clinton quoting the sayings of Mao Zedong, marvelling at the \"great inventions of mysterious China\" and lamenting his relationship with Monica Lewinsky thus: \"She was very fat. I can never trust my own judgment.\" Lewinsky may have her chance for revenge, however. The word is that she will visit China later this year to promote her own account of the world's most famous sexual act.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> China's publishing industry is in the midst of a frenetic bout of international matchmaking as it prepares for the opening-up of the wholesale book market in December. The change - a condition of membership of the World Trade Organisation - will allow foreign firms to form alliances with local partners to enter a market said to be worth 40 billion rmb (\u00a32.8bn). Bertelsmann was one of the first to wed, buying a 40 per cent stake in the private, Beijing-based 21st Century Book Chain last year.</p> <p>Not wanting to be left on the shelf, the state-run Xinhua Bookstore - which, with its affiliates, controls 70% of the market - revealed last month that it was looking for investors, possibly from overseas. Zhang Yashan, a director, told reporters the company aimed to announce a tie-up by the end of the year and float shares by 2006.</p>",
  "<p><strong>A Venetian Affair, by Andrea di Robilant (11hrs 25mins, Clipper, \u00a319.95)</strong></p> <p>Of all the great European city-states in the mid 18th century, Venice, the most cosmopolitan, was the natural home of political and social intrigue. Even against this colourful background, the true story of the love affair between Andrea Memmo, a Venetian nobleman, and the beautiful, young, half-English half-Italian Giustiniana Wynne is remarkable. It is based on letters found by the author's father in a Venetian palazzo once owned by the di Robilants, direct descendants of the Memmo family. They give a unique glimpse of public and private life at a time when, to be considered truly civilised, you had to be related to a duke, speak five languages, have your own box at the opera and correspond with Voltaire.</p> <p>Andrea passes on all counts, but Giustiniana's provenance is distinctly dodgy, which means they can never marry. How they manage their illicit and dangerous liaison is an exhilarating mix of Mrs Radcliff and Barbara Cartland, with Casanova, Lady Mary Wortley Montague, Titian and Frederick the Great's envoy to William Pitt taking cameo roles.</p> <p>Letters, especially love letters, bring characters to life as no other writing can, and it would take a curmudgeon not to sympathise when Giustiniana, exiled in London, complains to her lover that the English climate is so damp and society so dull she prefers to stay in bed all day reading a delightful new book she has come across called Tristram Shandy. My only gripe is with the author's failure to provide a few practical footnotes explaining how the Wynnes, despite their poverty, can afford to stay in Paris, Brussels and London attending masked balls and getting their hair dressed in the latest style.</p> <p><strong>Wolf Brother, by Michelle Paver (6hrs 30mins, Orion, \u00a312.99)</strong></p> <p>Social niceties played little part in primitive civilisations where survival was the only preoccupation. In the vast primeval forests peopled by nomadic hunters from the Viper, Raven and Wild Boar clans, Torak, brought up by wolves, swears to avenge his father's death. This is a story packed with ritual magic, natural law and blood-curdling adventures that I enjoyed as much as my 14-year-old son. Even without Ian McKellen's voice it would have been an epic, but the combination of Gandalf, demon bears, a boy who can talk to wolves and a wolf cub as charismatic as Bambi, is irresistible.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Fascination</strong><br>by William Boyd<br>224pp, Hamish Hamilton, \u00a316.99</p> <p>Sitting in the first-class cabin of a jet bound for LA, Alexander Rief goes over his sketches for a project in Pacific Palisades. Suddenly he realises he has a headache. \"It seemed almost physically to move round my head,\" he recalls, \"almost as if something were crawling around the interior of my skull...\" He takes two aspirin, but the headache has lodged itself in the centre of his forehead. He fears a blood clot; he fears \"strokes and tumours\". Finally, hoping for distraction, he reapplies himself to his work. But his work, it will turn out, is at the centre of the problem.</p> <p>Many of the stories collected in Fascination pivot around a single coolly observed moment, often a \"quotidian epiphany\", which catches its victims on the hop, about to fail to understand themselves yet again. In \"The Woman on the Beach with a Dog\", a New York businessman's life reassembles itself uneasily after a one-night stand. In the morning it is as if he has woken \"to a different, simpler world where there was only light and empty walls\"; but this Hopper-like suspension won't last.</p> <p>\"Loose Continuity\" offers us Gudrun Welk, whose history has somehow transformed her from an earnest young student of the Dessau Bauhaus into a designer of hamburger joints in postwar America. At the beginning of \"Incandescence\", a successful stock analyst is dazzled by the sulphurous image of the sun on a country-house lake, then singed by an old flame: \"I know now that it was a trick of the weather... I should have recognised it then for what it was: an omen.\"</p> <p>William Boyd's characters find themselves fighting to stay in the life they know. The onset of their condition seems sudden to them - a midlife crisis, a failed affair, a professional embarrassment - but its roots go all the way back. What's changed so suddenly is their awareness of things. They are mostly men, it has to be said, journalists who want to be poets, historians who want to be novelists, men of letters writing a film script, often married to good-looking competent women whose sole function is to remind them that they have dinner with Tim and Rosy tomorrow: which, of course, they forget. They want to forget.</p> <p>One moment we are sympathising with their vague downtroddenness, the next we feel all the rage their wives, parents and children must feel. William Boyd Man is barely present to himself, let alone his dependents; and we can't require him to be, and we can't require him not to be: and therein lies, somehow, the joke.</p> <p>In that he keeps a lucid eye on the alienation of middle-class men, Boyd occupies some of the same broad ground as JG Ballard and Will Self. But while Ballard is uninterested in individuals, Boyd is delighted by them, and where Will Self Man is angrily delivered, rawly conscious of his own failures, Boyd's characters dissociate themselves gently, only half aware of what they're losing or what they've already lost. They feel \"a kind of grief\" for their lives, but rarely acknowledge it. They yearn for control but change their minds a lot.</p> <p>As ever, Boyd is technically restless. In \"Lunch\", an advertising executive charts his sudden downfall - loss of job, marriage and dignity - as a collection of gastronomic jottings, starting with roulade de foie de veau farcie at \"Le Truc Interessant\" in Soho and ending up with ploughman's bap and a Mars Bar in the buffet of a train to Norwich. They begin as little more than a record of expenses, but bare details of price, wine and venue are steadily replaced by admissions of bitterness and despair. Boyd seems to be looking less for a way of telling a story than for a formal sleight of hand which will reveal at the same time as pretending to hide. A drift along the interface of memory and order drives \"Beulah Berlin, an A-Z\", in which Beulah talks of her life as the search for \"a personal encryption\".</p> <p>The idea seems central to Boyd's own performances. He believes we encode ourselves as our own compulsive or repetitive actions, then act out our characters by acting out of character. As demonstrations of this, the stories collected here are perfect. They would seem a little too perfect if they weren't also suffused with an understanding of love, desire and emotional incompetence. Behind the comedy and the stacked sleights of hand, vulnerable people can be seen quite clearly, blundering about trying to make contact with one another; personal disaster lurks and real lives are lost.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> M John Harrison's Light is published by Gollancz</p>",
  "<p><strong>Eleanor Rigby</strong><br>by Douglas Coupland<br>250pp, Fourth Estate, \u00a315.99</p> <p>What happens when the official chronicler of youth writes about the no-longer young? In other words, what happens when Douglas Coupland hits middle age? Coupland began the 1990s giving the name to Generation X with his bestselling first novel. His work to date has represented the state of young adulthood in the multi-corporate world as a fusion of brand-name nostalgia and melancholy mourning. \"I believe that you've had most of your important memories by the time you're thirty,\" says the hero of Life After God (1994).</p> <p>His novels generally give unexpected spirit a voice and pit nuclear paranoia and corporate apocalypse against a stunned instinct for kindness. The earlier novels masquerade, with a deceptive lightness of tone, as shapeless states or critiques of life which have turned into novels almost by chance. \"Do we understand the events that make us who we are? Do we ever understand the factors that make us do the things we do?\" Tyler asks in Shampoo Planet (1992). His previous novel Hey Nostradamus! (2003) was centred around a high-school shooting and its aftermath, and School Spirit, released last year in collaboration with the artist Pierre Huyghe, was essence of Coupland, a college yearbook seen through the eyes of a dead teenager.</p> <p>He loves the lyrical ephemera of pop. The first of his novels whose titles are also pop songs, Girlfriend in a Coma (1998), was an end-of-the-world vision; its heroine Karen fell into a teenage coma in the late 70s after seeing visions of a future where the cars were different, sex could kill you and \" 'meaning' had vanished... we were meaningless\". </p> <p>Eleanor Rigby, his latest novel, has the recognisable Coupland narrative voice; gently banal, slightly numbed-out, a discursive first person trying to make sense of a surreal world. Liz Dunn is 42, fat, plain and lonely. \"People look at me and forget I'm here.\" She's been fat, plain and lonely all her clich\u00e9d life. \"I feel like that one Scrabble tile that has no letter on it. I'm a Styrofoam puff used in packaging. I'm a napkin at McDonald's.\"</p> <p>The most exciting thing that's ever happened to her was when she was a child and found the murdered corpse of a transvestite by a railway line in the 70s, a time that's revealed as shockingly liberal in Coupland's comparison with the current post-9/11 world. But after Liz sees comet Hale Bopp cross the sky, her world changes drastically: her son comes back into her life, as if from the dead. He is 20, funny, difficult, vibrant, and he has progressive MS; \"for the sake of brevity I'll say that, just like Rome, MS has many websites\". He has apocalyptic visions of farmers unable to grow what they need, and he is blessed with the curious talent of singing tunes backwards.</p> <p>At a cursory look this book risks whimsy, seems a rather slender story about a middle-aged woman finding herself. A more careful reading reveals an utterly integrated and impossibly lightly held fable of blindness and vision. Its title acts as exactly the social synonym it is, not just for loneliness but for popular expectations of women of a certain age and spinster state, nothing more to look forward to than being buried along with their names.</p> <p>Liz, who at the start finds the idea of becoming soil quite exciting, \"moist and granular like raspberry oat muffins\", opens the novel with a discussion of restored sight. \"I had always thought that a person born blind and given sight later on in life through the miracles of modern medicine would feel reborn... and yet I've read books that tell me this isn't the way newly created vision plays out in real life. Gifted with sight, previously blind people become frightened and confused. Everything shocks and nothing brings solace.\"</p> <p>This particular book, very much about the alteration of vision, is a pivotal novel for Coupland. Funny, unexpected and fragile, it deromanticises loneliness to politicise presence. It does this purposefully against the grain; unlike the usual Coupland read, it jettisons mourning as a kind of wasteful self-indulgence. \"Death without the possibility of changing the world was the same as a life that never was.\" It is as if it sings its own title-song backwards, gracing Liz with an unimaginable fulfilment.</p> <p>Coupland is a postmodern transcendentalist. \"How are you supposed to derive solace from stories of oneness with nature written by those old-fashioned writers about hiking and breezes in the trees?\" Liz asks. \"If they were alive today, they'd all be in leather bars.\" Eleanor Rigby is about \"radical change\" - a phrase he repeatedly uses at the start of the novel. It's about a change in Coupland's writing too. He's still the chronicler of our times, and of the damage done to us by them, but here he's the chronicler of our potentials rather than our losses.</p> <p>The earlier books relied on product-placed shorthand as a reassurance of where we were and what we had in common: Ding-Dongs and gin, eightplex screens, a \"Kleenex box full of already nostalgic Polaroid snapshots\". This made Coupland himself a kind of brand name. Here these same tags light themselves up, metaphysical neons, signs of life. Hey Nostradamus! suggested a mature wholeness of conception in Coupland's new work. Eleanor Rigby, in which the lost get found and the cosmic gets real, does this too, with a goodness of heart that is actually inspiring.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ali Smith's The Whole Story and Other Stories is published by Penguin</p>",
  "<p>I took it that the decision to revive Calixto Bieito's production of Don Giovanni for 12 performances at the ENO meant something along these lines: \"Although you may have heard that the management wants us to play safe and please the stuffed shirts, we believe such a policy would be artistic death; art thrives on risk; we are artists, not corporate crowd-pleasers; we will fight for the artistic traditions of the old Colly; we shall overcome!\" Anyway they invited me to the first night, so I went.</p> <p>Every opera house, every individual production makes a kind of unspoken contract with the audience. Many would blush if the terms of the contract were read out loud. \"We know this art is pretty much ridiculous,\" said one old clause, \"but we guarantee you a painless and undemanding night out, and a chance to wear that frock.\" Or, in an upward revision, \"There may be great art going on, but don't worry: it is guaranteed not to impinge in any unwelcome way. There certainly will be something pretty to look at. The words will be either inaudible or incomprehensible. Have a nice time with the music.\"</p> <p>The contract with the old Colly was different. It said in part: \"This is not going to be a concert in costumes. It is going to be a genuine drama through music. We intend you to be able to understand and follow the words, and to that end we are going to perform in English. Genuine drama requires constant rethinking by real directors. This you will get from us. Our musical standards are going to be of the highest, and if you don't necessarily get the very top range of international singer you will find more than enough to compensate in the overall musical and dramatic quality of the evening.\"</p> <p>This was the contract between house and audience which inspired the partisanship of the latter, although it is worth recalling that, even in the \"Power House\" days (so called because the musical, production and management team was perceived as having a united purpose and strength), there was never a guarantee that the individual result would be a success. Far from it. Prestigious directors came in with catastrophes, such as a Fidelio that took place on a steel-mesh set which clanked when anyone moved.</p> <p>The audience generally speaking believed that the team in charge knew what they were doing, that they believed in it. But this self-belief, if it was there, was not reckless. I remember in the preparations for Jonathan Miller's Rigoletto that Mark Elder was terrified of allowing anything to be done which would cause the audience to understand that we were sending the opera up. Once people started to laugh, he thought, all would be lost. (The permitted, anticipated exception was the jukebox for \"La donn' \u00e8 mobile\".) No slang words at all, no Americanisms were allowed in the translation.</p> <p>The dramatic formula - the unspoken contract of the day - contained this central anomaly: the music was to be absolutely faithful to the composer's intentions, the production could involve a root-and-branch rethink, but the words sung must be in an English that never acquired too much individual character. What was aimed for was an inoffensive, singable, neutral.</p> <p>For the current Don Giovanni, Amanda Holden's translation is said to be \"adapted for this production\" (presumably by the author, who keeps a tight control over her own work). Occasionally one can tell where the vernacular has been allowed in, but for the most part we are in the world of conventional libretto-language (not surprisingly - the translation was for a previous production) and this means that its idiom bears no relation at all to what is happening on stage, which in turn bears no relation to the music.</p> <p>Even if the production were brilliant, there would still be these three divergent criteria at work: authenticity for the conductor, neutrality for the translator, indulgence for the director. But the production is very far from brilliant, and certainly not a mast to which the ENO should be nailing its colours. It is a case of a very few ideas, very quickly running out. The fights needed a fight director. The simulated sex needed a simulated sex director. Much of the first night audience slipped away in the interval.</p> <p>I was left, glorying in elbow room and a better view, and wondering what could possibly have been lost if the piece had been sung in Italian. What is the piety that insists on the English language, but which fails to make any link between the sung words, the idiom of the libretto and the events we witness on stage? What other sort of drama suffers from this institutional word-blindness? What is the real text on the private contract between the Coliseum and its audience? \"We guarantee the drama - please ignore the words\"?</p> <p>As I made my way down the stairs, someone was saying, with a forlorn brightness: \"But I think it will go down well with the young.\" But I should have thought the young deserve better.</p>",
  "<p>The Curious Life of Robert Hooke, by Lisa Jardine (Harper Perennial, \u00a38.99)<br> </p> <p>Robert Hooke left behind no defining great work, but claimed to have anticipated Newton's ideas and those of other leading scientists. Jardine argues he was probably right. Take the elliptical motion of the planets: Hooke hypothesised such a motion in conversation, but Newton produced the mathematical proof. Time and again this pattern repeated itself, but as the first curator of experiments at the Royal Society, Hooke was always rushed off his feet with the society's affairs so never completed anything. Newton's view of him as \"a man of strange unsociable temper\" has stuck, and Newton edited him out of the official story of the law of gravitation and destroyed Hooke's portrait at the society, leaving no image for posterity. In this companion piece to her biography of Hooke's lifelong friend Sir Christopher Wren, Jardine asks us to remember him with the admiration he deserves. <strong>IP</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> The Encyclopedia of Stupidity, by Matthijs van Boxsel (Reaktion, \u00a38.99)</strong><br> </p> <p>No one is intelligent enough to comprehend the depths of their own stupidity, states Matthijs van Boxsel in this engagingly eccentric history. Stupidity is inherent in us all and the more we seem to progress, the more mistakes we make. He argues that man differs from animals not by virtue of his superior wisdom, but by his stupidity, his ability to risk his own survival and that of his species on self-deluded whims. The technological advances that we hold up as proof of our progress are not always as clever as they appear: sun lotions contain carcinogens; cars built with sturdier chassis make it more difficult to extract casualties when they crash. And yet, he insists, without the mistakes and failures catalogued here, progress would be impossible. Fairy tales, science fiction, even garden history are haphazardly drawn together in this slightly surreal, often exasperating but consistently enjoyable view of the history of civilisation. <strong>NB</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Bill Clinton: An American Journey, by Nigel Hamilton (Arrow, \u00a39.99)</strong><br> </p> <p>Hamilton's previous biography famously outed Field Marshal Montgomery, so it's not wholly surprising to find that this specialist in sexual secrets has produced a life of Clinton that's a bemused but largely admiring account of how an erotomaniac somehow came to be US president - overcoming on the way other serious problems including a disastrous first term running Arkansas, near-divorce from chilly Hillary and exposure of his fibs in evading Vietnam service. The book concentrates on psychology, convincingly depicting the man from Hope as shaped by his fatherless upbringing by a working mother. It's excellent on the nitty-gritty of southern politics, with Betsey Wright (his chief of staff when governor) proving an invaluable source. Purchasers should be aware that it's something of a swiz: nothing on the jacket indicates that it stops in 1992 and does not cover its shagaholic subject's presidency. <strong>JD</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Arnhem 1944, by William F Buckingham (Tempus, \u00a39.99)</strong><br> </p> <p>Most accounts of Operation Market Garden paint Field Marshal Montgomery as the villain, vainly pushing ahead with the plan while Brigadier Frederick \"Boy\" Browning, the \"father of British airborne forces\", objects that it might be \"going a bridge too far\". Buckingham pours scorn on this version of events and lays the blame squarely at Browning's feet. In fact, were this an Alistair Maclean novel, he says, \"Browning would have to have been the German spy in the allied command\", so successfully did he sabotage the operation. Operation Market Garden was the self-serving Browning's last chance to consolidate his position in the military, and it had to go ahead at all costs. The result was that thousands of men died or were captured. British high command tried to blame the Poles, but Buckingham leaves the reader in no doubt that British army politics, inexperience and incompetence led to this tragedy of errors. <strong> IP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Global Ideas Book, edited by Nick Temple (Institute for Social Inventions, \u00a315)</strong><br> </p> <p>The people behind the Global Ideas Bank believe that technology can and must be used to change the way the world works. This handbook is a collection of ideas drawn from its website tackling housing, crime, politics and education. They range from the sensible (taxes on countries that make no effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; laws to ensure pharmaceutical companies publish negative as well as positive results) to the outlandish (mirrors that make us look thinner; laws to protect the rights of robots). At times the book does seem to prove the notion that innovations only create more problems. Mobile phone tracking devices may put parents' minds at ease but could be used for less noble motives. Labour-saving devices such as \"virtual fences\", whereby cattle can be monitored remotely, would surely increase unemployment in rural areas. And would a tax on divorce really \"make couples looking for an easy way out reconsider\"? <strong> NB</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Muddied Oafs: The Soul of Rugby, by Richard Beard (Yellow Jersey, \u00a37.99)</strong> <br> </p> <p>Rugby (a nine-to-five job for unsmiling, super-fit gladiators) has increasingly grown away from cheery, beery, character-forming rugger since the sport's top tier went professional, and now - with men ever less willing or able to surrender time to play and train without reward - threatens to crush it. That's the argument advanced by Beard, a novelist and utility back approaching the end of his playing days, who tests the amateur game's health by revisiting all his former sides and turning out for them where possible. He writes well, being equally good at evoking exhilaration and misery, and a quest that takes in Paris, Geneva and Tokyo as well as Cambridge, Argyll and Somerset offers intriguing contrasts. But the autobiographical approach generates too much material that lacks wider resonance: intercutting between his rugger memoirs and a more journalistic exploration of pro rugby might have produced a more compelling study.

  "<p><strong> The Quarry</strong> <br>by Damon Galgut<br>169pp, Atlantic, \u00a312.99 </p> <p>In last year's Booker-nominated The Good Doctor - and in, for that matter, such long short stories as \"Small Circle of Beings\" (published here in 1988, now out of print) - Damon Galgut impressively combined plain-speaking understatement with lethal emotional accuracy. In prose so stripped down that the occasional extra phrase stood out as flab, he faced the moral equivocations of the new South Africa, and found a fresh way to ask big questions: what is good? Can individuals make a difference? And is there any point? As Frank, deputy of a decrepit hospital in a forgotten bantustan, demands of idealistic Laurence, the \"good\" doctor determined to set up clinics in the bush, \"Do you really think talk and a few bright lights will save the world?\" </p> <p>In The Quarry , first published in South Africa in 1995, a man - we never learn his name - stumbles down a long, empty road, hungry, thirsty, near the end of his endurance. Shades of Steinbeck, Faulkner; even, in that classic beginning, of Hardy - though unlike Hardy, the book does not flower into social detail and complex explanation: we soon discover the man is being hunted, watch him murder to protect himself, but are never told what he has done, or why. </p> <p>The man finally fetches up in a mission station near the sea, at the far, alien reaches of white settlement, where the police station is surrounded by sandbags, the church doubles as a courtroom, and the nearby disused quarry hides all manner of sins. And though initially there is sanctuary, there's finally no escape from conscience: The Quarry essentialises crime and punishment, pushing men to such extremes that they \"were not people any more, they were a principle in operation: law and outlaw, hunter and quarry\". </p> <p>One of the impressive things about The Good Doctor was Galgut's acute ear for subtext, the sparks of power, disaffection, lust thrown off when well-defined, complex characters rub up against one another (Galgut is also a playwright): if your characters might as well be called the Policeman, the Fugitive, the Woman, and act accordingly, as types, you lose much of this particular pleasure. Meanwhile, the plot, in thrall to allegory, comes to rely too heavily on coincidences, even a well-timed eclipse. </p> <p>Though in many ways The Quarry is beautifully written, the desolate veld more of a character than those it subsumes, Galgut's style shows evidence of strain. Sometimes it's uncharacteristically overwritten (the food on a table is \"wrested from branches, from under the ground, from inside the bodies of animals\"); sometimes, reaching for both simplicity and profundity, it falls into empty portent: \"He went down to the water. There were gulls eddying above him again. He ignored them. He waded out a little way till the water reached his knees. It was cold.\" Or \"Then the sun, which is also a star, came up as it perhaps always will.\" </p> <p>In the end this is a crime story, and not a hugely gripping one, and although that's probably the point - the mundane wheel of hunter and hunted will turn for as long as humanity exists - my reluctant response is: who cares? The novel may actually have been the wrong form for this story: it would have made a good play, a poem, a movie - even, with its dramatic lights and shades, its vistas and near-wordless face-offs, a dance.</p>",
  "<p>Eve Ensler has been saying the word \"vagina\" wherever possible for the past eight years and does not appear to tire of it. The writer of The Vagina Monologues takes great pride in being known as \"the vagina lady\" and her peculiar fame has circled the globe. Ensler has become a worldwide celebrity icon for women who find hearing the word vagina spoken in public to be a profound and transformative experience. </p> <p>Their response has always completely bewildered me. I read The Vagina Monologues and thought it sounded like post-feminist confectionery - fleetingly bonding, perhaps, but scarcely more consciousness-raising than a trip to see the Chippendales. Germaine Greer took part in a British performance of the play and found it a \"much-hyped and fundamentally unchallenging piece of buffoonish American hoop-la\". The scramble of actors to land the part where they got to say \"cunt\" on stage seemed to smack more of a celebrity bandwagon than a feminist movement, and some critics suggested Ensler was little more than a theatrical one-trick pony, exploiting the word vagina as a publicity stunt. </p> <p>But Ensler has now written a new play, The Good Body. It is another series of monologues by women, but this time about their whole bodies. The play opens with an admission that the playwright loathes her stomach, and proceeds through a series of monologues featuring a woman with anorexia in Kenya, an Indian woman addicted to the gym, an African-American teenage girl at fat camp, a model almost entirely rebuilt by her plastic surgeon boyfriend. Its message is simple: \"Love your body and stop fixing it. It was never broken.\" </p> <p>With a sleek ebony bob, russet red lipstick and mildly unconventional outfits, Eve Ensler looks like a hippy Anna Wintour. She is physically charismatic, and has a way at 50 of seeming both maternal and girlish - a fast-talking New Yorker, yet yoga-calm. Most striking is her intense emotional engagement. She is what therapists describe as \"present\". </p> <p>Ensler has done a good deal of therapy. Her middle-class childhood was scarred by a violent father who raped and abused her from the age of five to 10. She doesn't like to say much more about her childhood, except that her emotional survival strategy was to \"fight back\". By her early 20s she was \"as wild as it gets\" - an alcoholic drug addict living naked in communes, having \"massive amounts of sex\". At 24 she met her first husband and with his support sobered up. </p> <p>But from her mid-20s to late-30s she suffered from profound depression as she struggled with the legacy of abuse. Her marriage eventually ended, although the couple remain close friends, and 15 years ago she met an artist and psychotherapist with whom she has been since. She attributes her salvation to love and long years of therapy, as well as many years of writing. By the early 1990s she had become a modestly recognised, though \"way, way downtown\", New York playwright, staging productions for audiences of no more than a few hundred. </p> <p>Then, in 1994, she wrote The Vagina Monologues. It was an unexpected and instant hit. Women queued up afterwards to tell her stories about their vagina, often stories of rape, abuse and violence - and the play transferred to off-Broadway. Ensler used some of the proceeds to found V-Day, a worldwide movement to end violence against women, and persuaded famous actors to star in gala performances in Los Angeles and New York. By 2001, V-Day had become a global phenomenon. Through V-Day there have now been 2,300 productions of the monologues in 1,100 cities, including Islamabad and Kosovo, and they have raised more than $25m. </p> <p>Ensler's brand of feminism has evolved since The Vagina Monologues. She says her new philosophy is a longing for women to stop trying to transcend their body, in an assertion of intellectual equality, but to name and return to it as the source of female wisdom and power. Women have fallen for a post-feminist delusion that the greater their physical self-control, the greater their prospects of happiness, not realising that alienation from their own bodies actually destroys the possibility of empowerment. </p> <p>\"What a way to control us. This skinny thing is genius,\" Ensler exclaims. \"It's genius. If you're hungry you don't have a lot of energy, and it's really hard to think. You can't do anything except think about food! What women are doing to their bodies is so utterly frightening - and, more importantly, so distracting. And if we don't get off it, it's going to be devastating.\" </p> <p>The single greatest source of futile preoccupation and self-reproach in women's lives today - even the most apparently liberated women's lives - is the very thing that makes them female. It is taken for granted that a woman will despise at least part, if not all, of her body, and increasingly considered advisable for her to go to any lengths necessary to correct it. Self-acceptance would be tantamount to self-neglect. </p> <p>This false prospectus, according to Ensler, has been responsible for the decline of feminism's international power. Women alienated from their own bodies no longer identify themselves by their universal femaleness, but isolate themselves instead into unisex categories - profession, class, nationality - in which a broader sense of sisterhood is meaningless. The feminist context of their problems has become lost. </p> <p>\"When I was researching The Good Body,\" Ensler explains, \"I went to a vaginal laser surgery centre in Beverly Hills where women were tightening their vaginas and trimming their labia. I flew from there to Kenya, where women were having female genital mutilation. And I thought, this is bizarre. What's different about it? Somebody got it into their heads that if they got a tight pussy they'd be more lovable. Somebody got it into their heads that if they got their clitoris cut off they'd get a husband. What's the difference? It's some system that got imposed to shut women down and cut them off. That's what people have to understand. Every culture has a mechanism for ritual operations that they utilise to impose their particular beauty tyranny and control women.\" </p> <p>The Good Body is in many ways a globalised dramatisation of The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf. Wolf identified a direct correlation between the increase of women's power and the shrinking of fashion's edict of the \"ideal figure\". Models got thinner, clothes got smaller, and women who as 1950s housewives had been allowed to be content with naturally rounded figures now discovered that to be successful professionals they had not only to be good at their jobs, but to spend a large portion of their life in the gym and of their salary on cosmetic improvements. Despite having opportunities now to change the world, when asked what single change they would like to achieve, repeated surveys of women always produce the same answer: weigh less. </p> <p>But Wolf wrote The Beauty Myth in 1991. Susie Orbach published Fat Is A Feminist Issue in 1978, Andrea Dworkin was railing against diets long before that, and long-established feminists such as Greer have therefore questioned whether Ensler is offering anything new. \"There are serious and important points to be made about women's attitudes to their own bodies,\" Greer wrote, \"but feminists were making these points 30 years before Ensler clambered on the bandwagon.\" </p> <p>Nothing annoys Ensler more than the suggestion that her work comes too late to have relevance. It provokes a rapid-fire outburst of evidence to the contrary; when the monologues first became a hit, for example, CNN famously ran a 20-minute profile of Ensler without using the word vagina. It was truly a remarkable editorial decision - but surely only an example of the peculiarly prudish nature of the US. </p> <p>\"Hel-lo! What about Paris? When they first staged the play, they said they couldn't put it on unless they changed the name. And Rome! They only put it on in Rome two years ago. There has been nowhere - not one country - where this word did not cause problems. So when people say they've been there and done it, I laugh. I go, really? Really? You've done it, have you? So that, for example, young girls are being brought up to know their vaginas and touch their vaginas and look at their vaginas? Nowhere is this happening in the world. Do you think there's sex education happening anywhere, where girls grow up to know what their bodies are, to look at their bodies? It's not happening. Not happening.\" </p> <p>She is right; it clearly is not. If anything, attitudes are moving in the opposite direction. When Wolf wrote The Beauty Myth, plastic surgery was still relatively rare; 13 years later it is not only routine but sold to women as a trophy of empowerment: you're an independent girl now, you can afford to buy this gift to yourself. How can Ensler explain women's willingness to buy into this idea? </p> <p>\"The whole problem with feminism was that it was always too 'heady'.\" The reply is instant and emphatic. \"So women were changing their ideas, but they weren't changing their being. It was all in the head. And so, for example, you could be a very strong woman and have a great independent job - but you could be with a husband who still battered you. We didn't change our bodies or our beings, so all this stuff kept happening. Now there's a chance for this next movement to change all of us, not just our heads.\" </p> <p>How does Ensler intend to achieve this? An insight was offered by a conference she organised in New York this autumn, attended by 1,500 women. The event was co-hosted by an organisation called Omega - a vaguely new age foundation (\"Dedicated to awakening the best in the human spirit\") which usually holds spiritual retreats and yoga weekends. This made for an interesting aesthetic mix. Young V-Day activists wore T-shirts that read \"Value your vagina. Vote!\", Omega devotees wore floaty kaftans from India, and in the exhibits hall there was a touch of Camden Market meets the student union. </p> <p>Ensler's collaboration with new age therapies struck me as surprising, for she describes herself as a radical feminist. A therapeutic emphasis on \"inner spirit\" is a very long way from the radical feminism Ensler grew up with in the 1960s and 70s, and many activists of that era would consider talk of \"doing work on ourselves\" fundamentally antithetical to their political project. It is men, they would argue, who need working on. </p> <p>\"I used to be a militant maniac,\" Ensler admits, smiling slowly. \"I used to divide the world into good and evil, right and wrong, because it was much easier. I don't see the world like that any more. It doesn't bring about change. I've been involved in social activism my entire life and I would argue that many people involved in social activist movements have done very little work on themselves. And that has created power structures and power dynamics that are just like the ones we're trying to get away from. Look at the inability to unify on the left - the endless fragmentation. I've just seen so many dynamics repeated over and over that don't work. And I think it has to do with people ...\" she pauses delicately, \"not having any self-awareness.\" </p> <p>Anyone who has been involved in leftwing activism could not fail to recognise what she is talking about. But feminism based on new age spiritualism can come dangerously close to pseudo-mysticism, hints of which were on show at the conference. From a stage adorned with candles and flowers there was talk of internal \"rivers\", of \"waters flowing\", and of other opaque symbolism. One young researcher stood up and solemnly announced: \"My focus is the empowerment of women. And what I know is that women know what they know.\" Can Ensler truthfully say she knew what that statement meant? </p> <p>\"I'll tell you exactly what that means.\" Her answer is quick and forceful. \"When you say to a woman you know what you know, there's not a woman on this planet that doesn't have an inner voice. One that she's learned to disregard because of patriarchal censorship. Like when people say to a girl, why did you get in the car with him? And she says, 'A voice inside me was telling me not to.' Only she'd learned to disregard it. That's what knowing what you know means.\" </p> <p>Another reason why some feminists have been dubious about Ensler is her willingness to promote her work through celebrity. Among the conference speakers were a number of Hollywood stars. Didn't their presence distract from more important matters? There was a time, she agrees, when she would have said the same. \"But there came a day - it was during the anti-nuke days - and there I was on a street corner, handing out flowers, as I did on a regular basis. And some guy spat on me and called me a dirty commie. And I thought to myself, this isn't working. This just isn't worth it. You are not changing anything. This is just for me. I'm just doing this for me to feel good; I'm not changing the world. </p> <p>\"And at the time I was so opposed to celebrity culture, and so opposed to the hierarchy of some people matter and some people don't. But there came a point where I said, OK, you can go on like this and you can stand on the street corner - and you can be right. But not have an impact. Or you can figure out another way of doing this so that people will actually show up to hear what you're saying. </p> <p>\"Do I think it's great that we have a celebrity system where some people matter and some people don't? No. But do I think we'll always create icons and legends? Yeah, I probably do.\" </p> <p>Ensler's most eloquent celebrity supporter has turned out to be Jane Fonda. For women under 35, Fonda is synonymous with her workout video, which in turn is synonymous with the 1980s. The Jane Fonda workout was sold to women on a promise that it would help make them thin but, more importantly, that it would make them strong. It was self-punishment masquerading as self-empowerment. </p> <p>Fonda now travels the world on behalf of V-Day, and was interviewed by Ensler on stage in New York. She addressed the audience in a voice breaking with emotion. \"My father always married women with thin legs,\" Fonda said. \"He used to send messages through his wives: tell her to wear longer skirts. By adolescence I hated my body. And you can't be in your body if you hate it, so I moved out and into my head. I'd moved out of my body to disown it because I wasn't perfect enough for patriarchy - and I didn't move back until I was 61. </p> <p>\"I was bulimic and anorexic for 35 years. I lived on willpower; I have tremendous willpower. I'd just will myself into exercise, and all the while I was living in my head, being perfect.\" Fonda said she had always loved trees. She was teaching herself to think of her legs as Arizona sycamores. \"I've betrayed my legs. They've never betrayed me.\" </p> <p>Fonda said her moment of epiphany about her body had come while she was watching a performance of The Vagina Monologues. \"For 20 years I thought I was a feminist - and then, while I was watching, my feminism just slipped from my head into my body - I felt it - and I've never been the same again. As I've begun to heal, I could feel a need to fill my body with what I was seeking all along - which was actually my feminine soul.\" </p> <p>Life-changing epiphanies were once the stock-in-trade of feminism. Women read The Feminine Mystique and suddenly saw the light - they recognised themselves in Betty Friedan's unfulfilled housewife, obsessed with the trivial tyranny of housework while the world passed them by, and they wanted a change. But the women's movement stopped producing new epiphanies, and it gradually unravelled from emotional certainty into self-doubt and dispute. Young women today could be forgiven for thinking that feminism was little more than the name given to an interminable media debate about how to get your work/life balance right. </p> <p>Having grown up in this era, the last thing I expected from Ensler was a moment of epiphany. It certainly wasn't forthcoming from The Vagina Monologues. But as she and Fonda were talking about bodies, quite suddenly the penny dropped. I felt something happen inside - intellectual anger about beauty tyranny changed into physical rejection of it, a less sophisticated but more formidable force - and I understood the difference between them. </p> <p>Feminists have for generations been urging resistance to the tyranny of beauty. But their language has been grounded in \"issues\", with the effect that Botox or anorexia became interchangeable with equal pay and flexible working hours. Ensler is proposing something quite different - not a version of feminism that includes, among other things, an argument against hating our bodies, but a feminism that derives entirely from trusting our bodies. \"When things change in your body,\" Ensler says, \"you say no to things. You have to.\" </p> <p>It is hard not to feel angry that feminism still has so far to go - and this may explain why some feminists have found Ensler so irritating. The popularity of The Vagina Monologues can be read as a depressing revelation of how little earlier feminist works had achieved. But it is hardly Ensler's fault if women still get a thrill out of hearing the word vagina; her plays are transforming armchair post-feminists into activists, and radicalising women more effectively than a whole generation of feminist theory. </p> <p>And The Beauty Myth is not the only book that appears to have passed many women by. There were some at the conference who could have stepped straight from the pages of The Feminine Mystique. One woman was 60 and said she felt rather uneasy with the \"politics\" she'd heard here. She had raised her sons \"in a traditional way\", and they were fine men. But then she added, uncertainly, \"I'm coming up to retirement age. I'm going to see a fortune teller and I want to ask, will there be more for me to do? I've been in the same house for 30 years. I've just redecorated it. But I don't know. Maybe it's time to move on - I think, maybe I should get out there. But I don't know where to go.\" She paused. \"I'm a bit afraid, to be honest. But I think I'm capable of more.\" </p> <p>Ensler is the first feminist in a generation to have won this 60-year-old woman's interest. The capacity to inspire epiphany in others is a life-changing gift. It is remarkable to inspire it in a woman who had never given feminism a thought - but possibly even more so in a younger woman who imagined she'd heard all that feminism had to say. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Good Body by Eve Ensler is published by William Heinemann on October 21 at \u00a310.99.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Cuba: A New History</strong> by Richard Gott<br> 384pp, Yale, <strong>\u00a318.99 </strong><br> </p> <p>All too often, Cuba conjures up images of a last communist stronghold, Fidel Castro's beard and an American military base holding Afghan prisoners. Richard Gott's invaluable Cuba: A New History dispels many convenient myths. Gott, a frequent visitor to the island, guides us through its troubled history, from the first colonisation by the Spanish in 1511 to the present day. </p> <p>It is a savage story. Even Diego de Vel\u00e1squez, who began with the intention of treating the Indians well, became brutal when they refused to work for foreign invaders. By the early 17th century, Africans brought in as slaves formed half the total population. Racism was always endemic. </p> <p>With the brief British occupation of Havana in 1762, however, the city suddenly became an international port, and North American tradesmen set up business there. Initially, the struggle for Cuban independence involved war with Spain, in which Jos\u00e9 Marti, the great 19th-century poet, was a notable fighter. The United States began to take an interest in the Cuban-Spanish conflict only after the US battleship Maine - which had not been on a war footing - exploded in Havana in 1898, with the loss of 258 American lives. After the ensuing war, the US occupied Cuba for four years. </p> <p>When a new Cuban party, the Independent Party of Colour, was formed in 1907 and launched an armed protest movement five years later, US Marines arrived to protect American sugar cane estates, and in the repression that followed, some 3,000 black Cubans were killed. </p> <p>The influence of Communism, as Gott skilfully explains, now became pervasive. Cuban Socialists were impressed by the Russian Revolution and formed an embryonic Communist Party in 1925. Several of its members were Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe. Significantly, the Communists had no prejudice against blacks taking a leadership role in the party. A revolutionary junta was set up in September 1933, led by a mulatto typist named Fulgencio Batista. A university professor, Dr Ram\u00f3n Grau San Mart\u00edn, was chosen as Cuba's new president. He refused to service the debt on American loans and nationalised the Cuban American sugar mills. However, Fidel Castro, in a highly significant 1985 comment aptly cited by Gott, sniped at Grau's - and, by implication, Batista's - claim to be revolutionary in character. </p> <p>The fact is that Communists were allowed to operate legally under Batista and even to launch their own newspaper, Hoy. In return, the Communists promised Batista the political support he lacked. During the second world war, Batista himself became President of Cuba and ruled as a social democrat, welcoming Communists into his government. </p> <p>On July 26 1953, Fidel Castro led an armed attack on the Moncada fortress barracks in Santiago - Cuba's second city. He was arrested after the assault failed and served less than two years in jail before being amnestied by Batista. I would have welcomed more details to explain why Castro was already so convinced that armed insurrection was the only way forward. After all, the author points out that Batista, on winning the November 1954 presidential election, announced the return of constitutional rule and guaranteed a free press. Nevertheless, Castro was proved right: in Batista's second term in power, he became cruelly repressive. </p> <p>In Mexico City, Castro's brother, Ra\u00fal, introduced Fidel to Che Guevara and Gott describes this first meeting wonderfully. The two men initially got on very well. Che badly needed a political cause, while Che gave Fidel valuable insights into other revolutionary experiments around Latin America. </p> <p>Batista fled Cuba on New Year's Eve, 1958, and Castro arrived in Havana as Cuba's new leader on January 8, 1959. Gott might usefully have included at this point a remarkable quotation from a speech Fidel made on May 21 1959, in which he declared: \"Our revolution is neither capitalist nor Communist ... Capitalism sacrifices the human being; Communism, with its totalitarian conceptions, sacrifices human rights.\" </p> <p>Castro's energy was to inspire some of the greatest Latin American novelists of the 20th century, including Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes. He charmed not only Russian politicians like Nikita Khrushchev and African revolutionaries such as Ahmed Ben Bella, but also French intellectuals such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. </p> <p>It would have been helpful for Gott to throw some light on the sources of Castro's antagonism towards the great Chilean Communist poet, Pablo Neruda, who wrote the first book of praise for the Cuban revolution, Canci\u00f3n de gesta, in 1960. Perhaps Neruda's relationship with Fidel became prickly because a poem in that book dared to remind Castro that the revolution ought to be like a bottle of wine: the work of many men, not just one. The degree of control Fidel exerted over his country's intellectuals was demonstrated in 1966, when more than 100 Cuban writers - apparently on Castro's direct orders - published an open letter in the Cuban government daily, Granma, condemning Neruda for taking part in a PEN congress in New York that year. A wounded Neruda never returned to the island. </p> <p>However, Gott is superb on Castro's political skills and on the Che-Fidel estrangement. Guevara, who saw himself as a 20th-century Don Quixote, had, in Castro's eyes, become a loose cannon, an unstable visionary. Even before Che's assassination in 1967, Fidel had been seeking an opportunity to abandon the armed struggle. (Gott was on hand himself to identify Che's body after the murder.) </p> <p>Gott explores Castro's cautious attitude to the Sandinista overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua in 1979. Fascinatingly, Fidel even suggested that the Sandinistas should establish a mixed economy and a pluralistic political system. </p> <p>In some ways, Gott saves the greatest surprise until the last. He writes that he expects little change in Cuba in the years ahead, even after Fidel Castro dies, because \"Cuba has already been governed for several years by a post-Castro government ... Castro himself is now largely absent from the scene ... He remains a figure from all our yesterdays, grey-bearded but eternally youthfully, like an ageing rock star.\" This is one of the many unexpected insights which make it likely that Gott's book will remain the standard work on Cuba for many years to come.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Life of Graham Greene, Volume 3: 1955-1991</strong> by Norman Sherry<br> 906pp, Cape, <strong>\u00a325 </strong><br> </p> <p>Professor Norman Sherry's battle to understand and explain the life of Graham Greene is a legend of modern biography. When they first met 30 years ago, Greene had read and admired one of Sherry's books - a study of Conrad - and Sherry, who was head of English at the University of Lancaster had, reportedly, read one of Greene's, A Gun for Sale. The biographer was looking for a new subject, and the author was tentatively encouraging. </p> <p>After another meeting in London, Greene was knocked down by a taxi and Sherry made a joke about the incident. Greene liked jokes and it seems that, on the basis of this one, he gave Sherry the job coveted by writers who knew his work much better. He sent his newly appointed biographer a map of the world, with all the places he had travelled to marked in red, asked him not to interview certain women and promised never to lie to him - though he also made it clear that he would not always be helpful. </p> <p>The first volume of biography, covering Greene's childhood, his early suicide attempts and conversion to Catholicism, was well-written and widely praised. The second volume, a patchier affair, appeared three years after Greene's death in 1991. It encompassed the years when Greene was creating his greatest characters, men John Mortimer has described as living \"on the dangerous edge of faith\". There was also Greene's love for a married American, Catherine Walston, which inspired The End of the Affair . </p> <p>With this last volume, it seems that all the fight has gone out of Sherry. The book is badly written, full of lazy assumptions and statements of the crashingly obvious. Borrowing the title of a Greene novel, Sherry has apparently described himself as \"a burnt-out case\", attributing illness and family problems to his exhausting task. </p> <p>His aim, as set out in the introduction, is to recreate Greene's \"total experience in a particular area at a particular time\". To that end Sherry spent seven years travelling the world, tracking down people Greene had known, and even contracting some of the same illnesses (he lost part of his intestine this way). One thinks of Pierre Menard, a character created by Borges, who wanted to think and see like Cervantes so that he could write Don Quixote anew. </p> <p>Here, for example, is Sherry in Mexico, reporting back on the man who inspired the Judas figure in The Power and the Glory: \"The mannerisms Greene noted, including the scratching under his armpit, were repeated in my company, but his way of life made this understandable. His mouth was toothless, the two fangs described by Greene gone, so that what Greene saw and felt, I did not.\" </p> <p>Clearly the lack of those two fangs disappoints Sherry: the \"total experience\" he wants to give us is compromised. But even if Sherry had loved the same women, drunk the same whisky and suffered from the same \"large, painful, internal pile\" it would not bring us closer to Greene on the page. He cannot \"see what Greene saw\" but he ought to be able to do something more valuable and that is show us the man he claims to have known better \"than I know the lines on my face\". Sherry met Greene lots of times and interviewed him extensively. Yet, over the course of 800 pages, he fails to bring him to life. </p> <p>During the years covered here, 1955 to 1991, Greene travelled to Haiti, the Congo and Cuba. He wrote novels including The Comedians, A Burnt-Out Case, Our Man in Havana, Monsignor Quixote and Travels with My Aunt, as well as plays and film-scripts. He championed the embattled regimes of Panama and Nicaragua, and finally lost hope of a life with Walston. His last 30 years were spent in Antibes, close to another married woman, Yvonne Cloetta. </p> <p>Sherry plots all these events, but in his hands we discover little about the feeling or motivation behind them. Many questions remain. Was Greene able to love women only when deceit was part of the equation? Was religion a way to add drama to his work, and to his life? How should we reconcile the \"hollow\", self-hating Greene with the funny and affectionate man his friends remember? Sherry does not do justice to his subject's remarkable generosity - Greene supported, often anonymously, a number of struggling writers as well as a rag-tag bunch of hard-up friends. He makes simple things complicated and vice versa, tossing out that Greene suffered from manic depression, or voicing opinions he seems not to trust himself. Greene never loved anyone as much as Catherine, writes Sherry, adding \"(I might be wrong)\". </p> <p>At other times he is simply defeated by the job of description. Greene was \"special, unquestionably so\", he tells us weakly, while Walston gets the luxury of italics: \"Catherine was <em>special</em>.\" </p> <p>It becomes a challenge to see what we can of Greene in spite of this intermediary. It is like jostling with someone to spy through a key-hole. You want to yank Sherry away, to get a better look at Greene, but his commentary obscures the view. Many of his observations mean next to nothing. \"He is cornered, truth dripping slow,\" Sherry tells us sagely, and elsewhere: \"[Greene] crossed the shadow-line, after casting a savage, sceptical look at his own face looking back from the mirror, over to a consuming vacancy reflected there, in an exhaustion as heavy as the sea.\" </p> <p>The purple prose makes you long for Greene, whose voice remains compelling in letters, diary entries and articles. To Walston he writes: \"I love you dearly &amp; I hate myself so much - &amp; it's the second half that seems to cause the trouble ... there's nothing in life one values like you - not work or children or books.\" And later: \"We are nearly together again - put out your hand.\" </p> <p>It is left to Greene himself to give the most coherent explanation of the moral ambivalence in his work and life: \"[A writer] stands for the victims, and the victims change. Loyalty confines you to accepted opinions: loyalty forbids you to comprehend sympathetically your dissident fellows; but disloyalty encourages you to roam through any human mind: it gives the novelist an extra dimension of understanding.\" </p> <p>There are other mercifully clear voices here too. Rebecca West is memorable on Greene's treatment of treachery. Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Burgess tackle his religious beliefs. Sherry piggybacks on the eloquence of others. But there is very little in the way of new commentary, possibly because Sherry has alienated the available sources or did not dare approach them. Louise Dennys, Greene's niece, editor and friend, was never asked for an interview. </p> <p>After 30 years, and the toll that has been taken on his personal life, it would be understandable if Sherry no longer admired or even liked Greene (he hints that he loved Greene's siblings more). All the same, his subject's legacy is not served well by this final volume of biography. Greene, perhaps, must share some of the blame. The novelist, who was famously careless with his life, may have been careless with his Life, too. </p> <p>It is terrible to read that, hours before he died, and just before falling into a final coma, Greene stopped taking morphia so that he could have a final word with his confessor, Fr Leopoldo Duran, and try to address some questions of Sherry's. </p> <p>And what were the questions? He never even tells us. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Miranda France is the author of Bad Times in Buenos Aires (1998) and Don Quixote's Delusions: Travels in Castilian Spain (2001).</p>",
  "<p>Michael Phelps yesterday pulled out of the 400 metres individual medley at the short course world championships in Indianapolis with a sore back. His withdrawal ended any hopes of a repeat of his performance in Athens in August when he won six Olympic gold medals. </p> <p>The 19-year-old won the 200m freestyle on Thursday but then told reporters he felt tired and sore. The United States team issued a statement saying that Phelps had been withdrawn from yesterday morning's heats after complaining of tightness in his back. </p> <p>Phelps will receive medical treatment and could still compete in the 4x200m freestyle relay final this evening. He is also scheduled to swim in the 200m butterfly and the 100m and 200m individual medleys. </p> <p>Phelps had made a winning return to the pool on Thursday, claiming victory in one minute 43.59 seconds to the delight of the home crowd at the Conseco Fieldhouse. Canada's Richard Say finished second in 1:44.39 while Ryan Lochte of the US took the bronze in 1:44.97. </p> <p>\"I'm tired,\" Phelps said after the final. \"I was really hurting pretty bad over the final 75 metres. I was definitely in pain. My body has been beaten up pretty good in the last three months.\" </p> <p>Distracted by sponsor commitments, endorsements and promotional appearances since his return from Athens six weeks ago, Phelps led from the gun but could not power clear of Say. With Phelps never seriously threatened, neither was the world record of 1:41.10, held by his Australian rival Ian Thorpe who is not competing here. </p> <p>Phelps said: \"This is my first short course gold medal so I guess it's pretty special. This is nothing to put down. I'm excited to be here and excited to win my first medal in front of the home crowd.\" </p> <p>Kaitlin Sandeno claimed three gold medals as the US team won all five finals on the first day. The 21-year-old won the 200m butterfly and 400m individual medley before swimming the anchor leg for the triumphant US relay team in the 4x200m freestyle final. The US men's team also took gold in the 4x100m freestyle final. </p> <p>Sandeno, who won three medals at the Athens Olympics, was almost forced to pull out after being struck in the face by a kickboard during morning training. </p> <p>\"I had a slight accident and for a while didn't think I would swim,\" she said. \"I'm excited I did so well because I'm not in very good shape.\"</p>",
  "<p>Four horses who competed in the Athens Olympic Games have failed drug tests. Waterford Crystal, the mount of Cian O'Connor, Goldfever, ridden by Ludger Beerbaum, Bettina Hoy's Ringwood Cockatoo and Harald Riedl's Foxy Xx all tested positive during the games, and the riders now have 10 days in which to request that the second sample (taken at the same time) also be tested. </p> <p>O'Connor, 24, gained the individual gold medal in the show jumping - Ireland's only equestrian medal in Athens. He said yesterday that he was \"utterly devastated\" that the test had proved positive and added: \"I am not a cheat.\" He intends to have the second sample tested as soon as possible. </p> <p>Ludger Beerbaum was in Germany's gold medal team in the show jumping and was their third best rider. But even without his score, the German team would still retain their gold medal because the fourth score was good enough. </p> <p>Hoy, Germany's event rider, had already forfeited her individual and team gold medals because of her error in the show jumping, resulting in the individual gold medal going to Britain's Leslie Law. Riedl was not in contention for a medal in the three-day event. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Robert Smith claimed his first win at the Horse of the Year Show on Kalusha, and came close to another victory when he gained the fastest time in the jump-off in the six-year-old championship, but had to settle for third place in this class when Di Conrish's Ocombo de L'Eau took out a rail in the double. </p> <p>Smith's win on the 12-year-old Kalusha in the Dick Turpin Stakes was a surprise as he did not think the twisty track would suit his horse.\"It was a horrible course to ride\" he said afterwards.</p>",
  "<p>Eddie Jordan relishes his role as formula one's joker. He was the life and soul of Honda's end-of-season party here, the Japanese hosts indulging his irreverent sense of humour with somewhat bemused good manners. These days, however, even Jordan's smile is a little strained. </p> <p>Time is running out for the Dublin-born wheeler-dealer who, almost 30 years ago, sold second-hand carpets to fund his own racing career. Recently his team, already under severe financial pressure as minnows battling to attract sponsors, lost their engine-supply contract after Ford closed Cosworth engineering - a decision which threatens to overwhelm Jordan in their battle to stay on the grid next year. </p> <p>\"To say I am disappointed with Ford is an understatement,\" a seething Jordan said yesterday. \"I have been trying to keep my total dismay under control. I am angered that after a long relationship I should get seven minutes' notice that they were pulling out. It's now almost too late to build a sophisticated car around a new engine. </p> <p>\"We already had an agreement and we'd agreed to design and build a car for next year. Ford said they would find a way of making an offer. And do you know what they suggested? They doubled the price for engines which were not going to be subject to any development. You cannot believe their behaviour and believe me, I am only scratching the surface. Ford have behaved appallingly, I kid you not. I can't get an appointment to talk to anybody to talk about it. This is a very sad state of affairs.\" </p> <p>Ford's interpretation is that they tried hard to accommodate Jordan and feel that his assessment is excessively critical, although their formula one programme has been under pressure from head office in Detroit. </p> <p>Jordan, meanwhile, admitted he would consider amalgamating or selling if he could guarantee the future of his team, but would not com ment on talk that he is considering an offer from Christian Horner, the owner of the Arden formula 3000 team whose driver Vitantonio Liuzzi won this year's European championship. </p> <p>\"All of those things are possible and it's better than going bust, so if I have to I will,\" he said. \"I would be happy to join a partnership if it means I can live to fight again another day. </p> <p>\"I believe that formula one is in danger of having an ageing population in key positions. People believe in themselves too much. There is no form of succession. There is no obvious succession for Bernie Ecclestone, for Frank Williams or for Ron Dennis. When I came into formula one I was in my late 30s and now I'm in my 50s. It's also just too expensive to come into this business.\" </p> <p>But that has not stopped the Guernsey-registered Midland Group announcing their intention to compete in 2006. The team would be called Midland F1 and is backed by Russian money, prompting plans for a Russian driver at some stage. </p> <p>They have recruited the Italian chassis maker Dallara to build a car, but like Jordan are on the look-out for an engine supplier. According to the team's co-founder Alex Shnaider, their headquarters will be outside London. </p> <p>\"The opportunity to create value is immense and it stuns me there are not more companies that have identified this opportunity. It is like getting an NBA or NHL franchise for free, as it is one of the world's most popular sports.\" </p> <p>Jordan, though, had some salutary words on the difficulties facing small teams in formula one. \"The situation for the small teams is pretty grim,\" he admitted. \"The presence of too many manufacturers have sounded the death knell for the smaller independent teams.\" </p> <p>He also criticised GPWC, the alliance of car manufacturers who compete in formula one and are seeking more influence. \"The GPWC persuaded Max Mosley [the FIA president] to give up the ban on electronic driver aids. He gave up on the condition that the manufacturers supplied engines, priced at no more than \u20ac10m [\u00a36.9m] for the small teams. Have they put a finger in their pockets to help? Have they hell!\" </p> <p>Jordan admitted candidly that he has gone through a severe learning curve during his 14 years as a formula one chief, a period which has seen the team's fortunes go full circle. </p> <p>\"In 1991, our first season in formula one, I could put my hands on \u00a35m, had about \u00a310m in sponsorship and ended up with an overdraft of \u00a35m. It was obscene. My whole life had changed. I had a profitable driver management business, we'd been one of the most successful teams in the junior categories, half my drivers were in formula one. </p> <p>\"I thought I was Jack the Lad, so what did I do? I blew it all on a formula one team. But I persisted with it and turned it into a success. I had the good days, and now I am feeling the pain.\"</p>",
  "<p>The 10-day Hindu festival of Dussehra is being celebrated in these parts. It is associated with the vanquishing of demons, though whether these will include Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne today is doubtful. </p> <p>India will have to bat on a deteriorating pitch for a day and a half against some of the world's finest bowlers if they are to retrieve this first Test at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. </p> <p>It cannot be done. Unless you believe in miracles. Such as the Miracle at Kolkata three years ago, when India beat Australia from a position of hopelessness. The more likely scenario is that Australia will pack their bags for Chennai tomorrow with a 1-0 lead in this four-Test series. </p> <p>They did not win the third day's play yesterday. They merely consolidated on having won five of the six sessions of the previous two days, and that was enough to leave India in a parlous position. </p> <p>First the Australians took India's remaining four first-innings wickets for the addition of 96 runs, to take a lead of 228, and then they scored 127 for four to extend that advantage to 355. </p> <p>They are likely to push this up to about 500 before declaring halfway through today's afternoon session. Then they will again unleash their bowlers, with the occasional low bounce and the willingness of the ball to reverse-swing precociously likely to prove even more potent weapons than Warne's twirl. </p> <p>The worrying news for England supporters with an eye on next summer's mouth-watering Ashes series is that Australia's attack looks formidable, with the considerable powers of McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Warne looking undimmed while Michael Kasprowicz looks a much im proved bowler as he bustles in from a short approach. He has an eye for reversing, hits the bat harder than some suppose and thrives on long spells. </p> <p>Their best bowler in this match has been McGrath. At 34, and following an ankle operation, he is half a yard slower than when he was in his pomp in England in 1997 - not that he was ever really quick. But his principal weapons of accuracy and minor movement seem under even greater control. </p> <p>He finished with figures of four for 55 from 25 overs and said last night: \"I've swapped my boots for a pair half the weight and I feel a lot lighter on my feet. I have more energy and I'm going through the crease better. </p> <p>\"This is the best I've bowled for two or three years. The seam is low on the ball, and it flattens out after five or six overs. So it was nice to get two wickets in my first two overs on Thursday - especially as Rahul Dravid was one of them. What I didn't expect was for the ball to reverse after just 10 overs. But the pitch is very abrasive. Today the pitch was very slow and the ball felt very soft, so it was a question of chipping them out bit by bit.\" </p> <p>India resumed on 150 for six and would have been chipped away sooner but for the character of their tail. The home wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel was particularly obdurate, with an innings of 46 spread over 3 hours. </p> <p>Patel looks younger than his 19 years and when he toured England two years ago Alec Stewart asked him whether he got his pads from Mothercare. He was also reminded of the new rule that young wicketkeepers must wear a helmet when standing up unless they have a note from their mother. </p> <p>Irfan Pathan, also difficult to dislodge, appeared unlucky to be given out by Billy Bowden, under pressure from Matthew Hayden, caught behind off Warne. Anil Kumble hung around for 98 minutes before Gillespie bowled him. </p> <p>Justin Langer was lbw to Pathan's fourth ball of Australia's second innings and Hayden was brilliantly thrown out by Harbhajan Singh. Then Simon Katich edged a googly and Darren Lehmann was caught off his gloves. </p> <p>Diwali - the festival of lights - is also upon us. If India save this there will be even more firecrackers than normal. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Madras high court has suspended all newly-elected officials on India's cricket board, including the president Ranbir Mahendra, over the conduct of the board elections held last month. A retired supreme court judge, S Mohan, will take over as an interim administrator until the case is resolved.</p>"
