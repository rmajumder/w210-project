  "<p>The A-level and GCSE papers have been marked, the results are being published and the newspapers are having a field day compiling league tables purportedly showing the best-performing schools. Independent and grammar schools are receiving all the plaudits from the rightwing press. But little mention is made of the influence that private home tutors have had on their results. </p> <p>From my own experience of private tutoring in recent years, I strongly suspect that home tutors are helping to throw a more favourable light on the results of independent and grammar schools than they would otherwise deserve. </p> <p>I was first drawn into the world of private tutoring six years ago, when a neighbour of mine in Islington asked for help with his son, who was floundering in the first term of his A-level physics course at a local comprehensive. He was taking the exam in the first module of the course four months after he had started and his teachers were expecting him to fail badly because, in a class of 22, he was failing to understand many of the new concepts that were being thrown at him. I had six weeks to rescue him and, with the help of my handwritten notes and a lot of explaining, he managed to obtain a grade C, which was one of the top marks in his class. </p> <p>My first pupil was joined by his friend, who was also struggling, and I was soon teaching A-level maths as well as physics. At the end of their first year, these so called under-performing students were obtaining A and B grades. </p> <p>I did not realise it at the time but this quiet, leisurely start to private tutoring in maths and science would lead in the following years to a demand for my services that I could have little hope of meeting. </p> <p>With my first pupils, I allowed myself the luxury of believing it was the quality of my teaching that was bringing about the improved results. However, this notion was quickly dismissed after the parents of my two first pupils asked me to help their sons with the statistics module of their A-level maths syllabus. I let them know that my knowledge of statistics was rudimentary, but the lads were doing so badly I could not abandon them. It took hours of my time to learn the material I was to teach but eventually, after a few weeks, the boys gained confidence to such an extent that they were leading me a merry dance in the subject. They both gained A grades in their statistics papers, not because of the quality of their teacher but because for one session a week they had the chance to speak to an adult who was conversant with their problems. </p> <p>It is this kind of individual tuition in our independent schools that makes them so attractive to middle-class parents. They pay out many thousands of pounds each year for their children to be educated in small groups. But still many of them feel the need to fork out more money for home tutors. Many of the inquiries I now receive about private tutoring are from parents who send their children to some of the most prestigious independent schools in London. Some middle-class parents are increasingly prepared to squeeze out and pay for any extra little advantage they can obtain for their children, in addition to that conferred by the education given by independent schools. </p> <p>There is little doubt that the nationwide shortage of maths and science teachers is affecting the independent sector as well as state schools. This has to be the case, otherwise the independent schools would not be paying over the odds for the poor teaching that is being served up in these subjects. It is not uncommon for me to find in the science workbooks of some of my independent school pupils page after page of notes that have been laboriously copied from a chalkboard or overhead projector. When I ask how the pupils feel about this, the stock reply is that the teacher is \"so boring\". Such teachers ought to take their methods into some of our comprehensives. They would be eaten alive. </p> <p>It is not just the teaching methods that can give cause for concern with some independent school teachers. Sometimes I find that their subject knowledge is a real worry. In one lesson last spring I was reviewing, with one of my pupils, a multiple-choice science test paper she had been set by her teacher. Her paper had been marked and three answers out of 30 had been marked wrong when in fact they were correct. This was no aberration because other pupils' papers had been marked in a similar way. </p> <p>The criticisms levelled at maths teaching in this country seem to apply equally to independent schools as to state schools. Final-year GCSE students in both sectors are still over-reliant on calculators. Too many of my private-school pupils find long multiplication and division difficult because they have not yet sat down and committed multiplication tables to memory. Some can eventually tell me that 7x9 is 63, but not before they have written seven nines in a line and then added them up. Unfortunately for these pupils, the GCSE maths exams now have non-calculator papers and they often come unstuck. </p> <p>The quality of science and maths teaching is only one of the reasons middle-class parents call me in to help out. Another factor is the in fluence that the highly competitive nature of independent and grammar schools has on the confidence and self-esteem of some of their pupils. I am often called to the aid of teenagers who find themselves in the bottom sets in maths and science. They think they are useless in the subjects even though they eventually obtain A and A* grades. If these students were in truly comprehensive schools, they would be able to judge their own abilities on a more rational scale at an earlier age. Perhaps we might then be able to persuade more of them that maths- and science-based careers are worth following. </p> <p>Oxbridge entrance is clearly high on the agenda of many parents seeking the help of private tutors for their children. I am told there is no hope of obtaining an interview for Oxbridge unless an application shows a string of A* and A grades at GCSE. This is one of the main reasons why I am inundated with calls for tutorial help after Christmas each year. Mock exams have led teachers to predict B grades in maths or the sciences at GCSE and parents begin to fear that the cherished Oxbridge place for their child is about to disappear. </p> <p>Maths and science are not the only subjects for which many parents are passing over their cash to private tutors. Since I visit the child's home to do my teaching, I am aware that I am often preceding or following tutors in other subjects. With some children it is often difficult to arrange suitable times to do the teaching since their evenings are so taken up by tutors. </p> <p>Islington, Camden and Hackney, where I do most of my private tutoring, are the areas of London where many of the nation's opinion-formers reside. As a result, I have been asked to help the children of politicians, television personalities, highly regarded barristers and others at the top of their chosen professions. Invariably they are New Labour supporters with a social conscience but they are not prepared to submit their children to the vagaries of the state secondary school system. </p> <p>One is tempted to fall back on the words of the columnist Simon Jenkins to explain this phenomenon. He wrote recently that \"British politics, we must constantly remember, is always about class. To be middle class is above all else not to educate your children alongside working-class ones, at least unless the latter are bright.\" </p> <p>Jenkins's words may have some validity at secondary level but they do not explain why many of the children I teach attended state primary schools that had comprehensive intakes. We have to probe more deeply for an explanation. Middle-class parents who eschew their local comprehensive for the private sector know it is the absence of their children that contributes to the below-average examination results. They know that if their children attended the schools in greater numbers, results would improve. </p> <p>The major concern is that children from deprived families who have emotional and behavioural problems become more difficult to control as they get older and the local schools become rougher. Independent and grammar schools have far smaller numbers of these pupils and the concern is greatly reduced. </p> <p>A recent survey has shown that 5% of London's school children are receiving help from private tutors. On present trends this figure may increase sharply in the next decade. If my experience is anything to go by, the rapidly increasing band of private tutors in the capital will be enhancing the results of independent and grammar schools. </p> <p>We ought to be questioning whether the results from our independent schools truly represent the quality of the schools. In addition, we should have few qualms about those universities that are giving entry preference to bright kids from comprehensive schools with inferior grades who are not receiving the extra tuition that money can buy.</p>",
  "An army reservist charged with abusing Iraqis at Abu Ghraib prison said yesterday that he would plead guilty to some offences. <p>Staff Sgt Ivan \"Chip\" Frederick, 37, of the Maryland-based 372nd Military Police Company, said in a statement issued by his lawyer: \"I will be pleading guilty to certain charges because I have concluded that what I did was a violation of law.\" </p> <p>He is charged with maltreating detainees, conspiracy to maltreat detainees, dereliction of duty, and wrongfully committing an indecent act. He is to appear at a pretrial hearing today in Mannheim, Germany. </p> <p>Sgt Frederick, a Virginia state prison guard in civilian life, is one of seven members of the 372nd charged; another, Specialist Jeremy Sivits, pleaded guilty to three abuse charges in May and was sentenced to a year in prison. </p> <p>Sgt Frederick was the senior enlisted soldier at Abu Ghraib between October and December, when the mistreatment allegedly occurred, and among the first identified by CBS when it broke the story in April. A photo shows him standing behind a naked prisoner smeared with faeces. </p> <p>He has claimed the abuse was orchestrated by military intelligence officers rather than MPs, according to a diary that his family made available. </p> <p>In Mannheim yesterday, a military judge demanded prosecutors speed up their investigations. Col James Pohl was told a lone investigator was reviewing thousands of pages of records in a secret computer server at Abu Ghraib. \"And in what millen nium will that be finished?\" he asked. He was hearing a third case, that of Spc Charles Graner, whose lawyers complained the delays were preventing them from receiving evidence. </p> <p>Col Pohl said he wanted the report on the server inquiry by December 1, but might dismiss the case at the next hearing in October in Baghdad if there was no sign it was nearly finished. He said the government could always refile charges later. </p> <p>Col Pohl also told prosecutors that the government seemed to be dragging its feet in three other investigations, but he chastised the defence for moving too slowly - complaining that Spc Graner's lawyers had not interviewed top US military commanders in Iraq or reviewed documents months after he had permitted them to do so.</p>",
  "The former Zimbabwean cabinet minister Eddison Zvobgo, who has died aged 68 after a long illness, was a founder of the ruling Zanu-PF party. But though a spokes- man referred to his death as a great loss to country and party, Zvobgo had become a controversial figure in recent years, having led some challenges within Zanu-PF to the autocratic rule of President Robert Mugabe. Endowed with a flashing intelligence and a razor-sharp wit, Zvobgo never hid his ambition to succeed Mugabe; as a result, he was perpetually sidelined. <p>Zvobgo was born in southern Zimbabwe, near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo), where his father was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. He went to mission schools, where he excelled academically before graduating from Tegwani secondary school. In 1960, he won a scholarship to Tufts University, in Boston, Massachusetts. After taking a bachelor's degree there in 1964, he returned home to be promptly arrested for his involvement in the nationalist struggle against white minority rule in what was then Southern Rhodesia. </p> <p>Freed in 1971, he returned to the US to study law at Harvard, where he took his PhD. He then taught criminal law as an associate professor at Lewis University College, in Illinois, before going to Mozambique, where he became a key aide to Mugabe in 1978. </p> <p>Zvobgo played an impor tant role in the international negotiations that ended the bitter Rhodesian bush war and led to British-sponsored, all-race elections ahead of independence in 1980. Dur ing the 1979 Lancaster House talks, he was the Zanu-PF spokesman, and impressed many in the international press with his quick repartee and astute analysis of the negotiations. In the 1980 elections, he won a seat in parliament for Masvingo, which he continued to hold until his death. </p> <p>An influential member of Zimbabwe's first fully independent cabinet, Zvobgo was minister for local government and housing until 1982, and minister for justice until 1985. As minister of parliamentary and constitutional affairs, in 1987 he made several amendments to the constitution that concentrated power in the hands of the president and moved Zimbabwe towards a one- party state. Critics suggested he was creating powers that he hoped to enjoy himself once Mugabe retired. But by the mid-1990s, it became clear that Mugabe had no intention of stepping down from office. </p> <p>In 1992, Zvobgo was moved to the less influential post of minister of mines. In 1996, he survived a car accident, in which both his legs were broken; the incident looked suspiciously like several others in which challengers to Mugabe have died. Shortly after the accident, Mugabe demoted Zvobgo further to minister without portfolio, and, in 2000, he was dropped from the cabinet altogether. </p> <p>Zvobgo became a regional power baron in Masvingo, where he owned two hotels. In the 2002 presidential elections, he refused to campaign for Mugabe, but did not endorse the opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (DMC). He also voiced his opposition to the sweeping media law, passed the same year, calling it \"the most serious assault on our constitutional liberties since independence\". </p> <p> N one the less, despite his criticism, Zvobgo eventually voted for the legislation, which was used to close off Zimbabwe's only privately owned daily newspaper, the Daily News, and to arrest more than 70 independent journalists. </p> <p>He became the subject of a party disciplinary inquiry in 2003 for his refusal to campaign for Mugabe and his attack on the media laws as a weapon to stifle opposition, but allegations of disloyalty were eventually dropped. He was accused also of holding private talks with the DMC at the time when Zanu-PF abandoned formal dialogue between the two parties. </p> <p>Meeting with a gaunt, but still ebullient, Zvobgo in 2002, I noticed how he had mastered the art of criticising Mugabe and Zanu-PF only on technicalities. Smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee, he was outgoing and voluble, happily talking about his role at Lancaster House and the early years of independence. He became more guarded when dis- cussing Zimbabwe's current crisis. Although he gave a qualified criticism of Mugabe's land seizures, he assiduously avoided any sweeping statements in favour of a free press, respect for human rights, and free and fair elections. He refused to condemn Mugabe or Zanu-PF; even pushed aside, he remained loyal. </p> <p>It is expected that Zvobgo will be declared a national hero and buried in Harare at Heroes' Acre. His wife Julia, a former Zanu-PF MP, died in February at the age of 67. He is survived by seven children. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Eddison Zvobgo, politician, born October 2 1935; died August 22 2004</p>",
  "The Spanish government yesterday held out the promise of amnesty to illegal immigrants, saying it would offer full legal recognition to many already in the country and stop turning back boats before they reached its shores. <p>The move was welcomed by some as an attempt to end the exploitation of immigrant workers and reduce the number of people who drown trying to enter Spain.</p> <p>But it was attacked by the opposition, who said it was foolhardy to step out of line with the rest of Europe.</p> <p>Consuelo Rum\u00ed, the immigration minister, said foreigners with working contracts would be offered work permits and residency papers as part of the new immigration plan to be launched in September.</p> <p>Ms Rum\u00ed said the aim of the plan was two-fold: \"We want to facilitate the social integration of of foreigners and uncover the hidden economy that feeds off them.\"</p> <p>The move appears to contrast strongly with the approach elsewhere in Europe. The EU's incoming justice and home affairs commissioner, Rocco Buttiglione, told Reuters yesterday that the growing problem of people seeking asylum for economic reasons was a \"timebomb\".</p> <p>He called for transit countries around Europe's borders to set up holding camps for prospective immigrants.</p> <p>\"The camps would take in immigrants who, for example, arrive from sub-Saharan Africa, to offer them humanitarian aid and information about job possibilities in Europe,\" he said. \"But they would also investigate, identify and send back those who don't meet the criteria or who would not be able to integrate.\"</p> <p>For the past three years Mr Buttiglione has been a minister in Italy, which like Spain has sought to prevent immigrants entering by sea. The Italian approach has proved controversial.</p> <p>Its navy has tried to stop boats from landing and forced them out of Italian waters. In 2002, 65 immigrants died when their boat capsized while being towed by an Italian navy vessel.</p> <p>By contrast, the Spanish defence minister, Jos\u00e9 Bono, said at the weekend that the navy would no longer intercept immigrant boats in Spanish waters unless they needed immediate help. The decision is a recognition of the increasing dangers faced by would-be immigrants.</p> <p>A quarter of the immigrants entering the EU illegally do so through Spain and the summer months bring feverish activity across the Gibraltar Straits. Traffickers in highpowered speedboats play cat and mouse with coastguards to land people and drugs up and down the coast of Andalucia.</p> <p>The increasingly sophisticated technology used to combat the professional smugglers forces those with less resources to take ever more dangerous routes.</p> <p>Many prospective immigrants head out into the Atlantic in flimsy wooden boats in an attempt to avoid border patrols. They make for C\u00e1diz, 70 miles up the coast from Gibraltar, or try to cross the 60 miles of open water between Morocco and the Canary Islands.</p> <p>Six people died this weekend. Four sub-Saharan Africans drowned when their boat capsized just a few metres from the shore off Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands. Police and holidaymakers managed to rescue 34. Two more bodies were found on the coast of mainland Spain.</p> <p>Ms Rum\u00ed blamed the previous government, of the Popular party, for many of the problems.</p> <p>\"That government left us in chaos,\" she said. \"They didn't regulate the flow of immigrants, they didn't control the borders, and they sustained confrontation with Morocco, with whom we are trying to re-establish cooperation.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, she hopes the PP would join a cross-party agreement on the issue.</p> <p>Such a prospect seems unlikely. The PP is angry that Spain is stepping out of line with the rest of Europe. \"We are very worried by this announcement,\" said Angeles Mu\u00f1oz, its immigration spokesman.</p> <p>\"The Socialists are planning a radical departure from a policy that was developed through consensus with our European partners. It's just not possible to have a different policy, and certainly not for Spain given our levels of unemployment\"</p> <p>Ms Rum\u00ed called on other European leaders to follow the Spanish lead and address the failings of their policies.</p> <p>\"We are sorting out these problems despite a lack of leadership from the EU and the international community,\" she said. \"Spain is already leading the debate over common entry criteria and the social integration of immigrants.\"</p> <p>The minister added that it was too early to say how many people would be affected by the change in rules. But she warned that the initiative would not change the situation for those who had just arrived in the country.</p>",
  "Under a tree in Liberia, I sit with six giggling women. They are internally displaced people, or IDPs, and they think I've lost my mind. My translator, Marline, who is also an IDP, is trying to translate my question: \"What do you do when you're a refugee and you get your period?\" <p>Marline asks me to repeat the question, makes sure she understands, and then translates. \"She want to know,\" she says, in lilting Liberian patois, \"what you do when you receive\" - and she raises her hands heavenwards - \"and you runnin'?\" Refugees have no time for linguistic niceties. Displaced, refugee, IDP - all it means is running, literally, for years. </p> <p>The women are still laughing at my question, but they answer it. You take a strip of your lappa (sarong), they say, if you've got one. You use it as a pad, if you've got any knickers left, and if you can find a stream and five minutes to stop, you wash it. They laugh, when I ask them how you wash in the bush, how you wash your children. They say it very slowly, all together, as if to a stupid person: \"No soap!\" They see that they can't explain properly how things were. They see that when they say, \"We had nothing\", I don't understand how much nothing that is. </p> <p>I get used to incomprehension in Liberia, where conversations go like this: \"When did you leave your home?\" \"When the war met me.\" \"Which one?\" Or, \"How was your child killed?\" \"Which one?\" </p> <p>The bafflement works both ways: I find it hard to understand how a country this devastated can still be standing. They can't understand why I don't know that the best place to hide a mobile phone from rebel soldiers is in your backside. The woman who tells me this mentioned it in passing, during an interview about the women's health programme she works on. I checked: she definitely meant \"in\" your backside, not next to it. </p> <p>She has had 14 years of war to learn this. Liberia started falling apart in 1989. Since then, a variety of armed men, women and children have ripped the country to bits, fighting under a variety of lethal acronyms: PRC, LPC, NPFL, INPFL, ULIMO-J, ULIMO-K, LURD, MODEL. President Charles Taylor, now safely in exile in Nigeria, was no better than his opponents. Now, nearly a year after peace was first declared, 750,000 Liberians - a quarter of the population - are still on the run from their homes. The streets of Monrovia are now bustling - I see furniture shops in blackened houses; a barber's shop in a charred bus shelter; a shop called \"Living Proof\" - but this is because the whole country has moved to the capital. The rest of Liberia is empty. Proportionately, this is equivalent to 12 million people, or more than the population of London, moving to Nottingham. </p> <p>After so many years of war, it got to the point where it didn't matter who the enemy was. \"Anyone with a gun,\" says Mary Kamara, an elegant woman who also works on the women's health programme. During an interview about her work, she remarked in passing that she had been a refugee since 1989. Mary's colleague Grace - beautifully dressed now, in her African clothes and gold jewellery, fitting no stereotype of what a refugee should look like - still keeps a bag packed every night. She used to sleep in her jeans, her money in her knickers. </p> <p>Not that it would have stayed there long: Liberia's fighters took everything. The child soldiers stole toys. The adult soldiers even stole dirty dishes. They took what they could, and they could take what they wanted. A third of Liberia's women have been stripped during the wars. A hand down your pants, fingers in your pubic hair, groping for money - it was so standard it was hardly worth commenting on. These women were stripped often enough to develop a verb for it. \"They naked me!\" And they laugh. Eventually I get used to this. </p> <p>\"We are a very peculiar people,\" says Grace. \"A lot of people will never be able to understand how we can laugh through the worst. They will launch a rocket and 20 people die and 30 minutes later, people will be looking for the humour in the situation. That's the way we've been able to carry on.\" She thinks they may have inherited some sort of genetic resilience from the freed American slaves who founded Liberia in 1847. It's all they have got, really: at last count, there were only 28 doctors in the country, and no psychiatrists. But the need is staggering. I ask women refugees if they know any women who have been raped, and they snort with laughter again. \"Ha! There are so many, I can't remember!\" </p> <p>When 60,000 displaced people moved into Monrovia's SKD stadium last year, the non-governmental organisation Concerned Christian Community found that of the 1,502 women registered with them, 626 had been raped. These are the ones still alive. I met women who had seen women raped with sticks and bayonets, by boys who said their private parts were too clean to use on women. \"If you met a child soldier,\" says Grace, \"they used to say, 'Woman da wat?' It means, 'Of what importance is a woman?' It means you are nothing. If they say that, forget it.\" </p> <p>In a Monrovia office at dusk, I meet General Janet Jackson. I had met plenty of refugees by then - over the course of two weeks in Liberia, I only met two people who hadn't been dis placed - and I wanted to see someone who had made them that way. Jackson qualified. She may not be as famous as other female fighters, such as Black Diamond, who fought in bikinis and carried rocket-propelled grenades with long painted nails, but she was a one-star general in Charles Taylor's militia, and a member of the presidential bodyguard. She is fearsome, and she is unapologetic. </p> <p>Jackson explains away atrocities such as the use of human intestines as checkpoint barriers as military tactics. \"If people see that, they scared of you.\" She says her forces carried out no rape, no murder. \"Only looting. Everyone did looting.\" She is lying, and she gives me the creeps. </p> <p>But Janet is Liberia's future, the same as Grace, Mary and Joanne. The same as Michael Smith, a 15-year-old boy whose fighting name was Death Squad, who - like more than 20,000 other boys and girls - has spent the past few years drugged, drunk or wrecking his country. Smith says he wants peace, and has cut his hair to prove it. Fighters had corn-rows, bandanas, dreadlocks. Now the only people who dare wear them are the shameless ones. </p> <p>Smith and Jackson say they are ready for peace, though they had nothing to do with creating it. Even so, it is holding. Liberia has been allocated the largest peacekeeping force in the world, after the US put its influence behind solving the problems of its once-important African satellite (Liberia has the largest CIA listening station in West Africa). A UN donor conference in February allocated more than $274m to Liberia's reconstruction, but there was little money for emergency assistance, in a country with little healthcare, endemic malnutrition, hardly any schools, teachers, or houses. </p> <p>\"Just take us home,\" say the women stuck in a camp outside Monrovia. \"We will rebuild.\" They will have to: 75% of the country's households are headed by women. It will be Marline and Grace and Mary who put Liberia back together, with mud and sticks or forgiveness. In the IDP camp, a young woman tells me how she was raped when she was four months pregnant, by a 15- year-old soldier. She sees him from time to time, because his parents live in the same camp. \"I want to ask him why he do that, but he runs away.\" </p> <p>Another young woman's brother joined the rebels, then came home and held his family up at gunpoint. Years later, in peacetime, he begged forgiveness. His sister gave him a T-shirt, a precious thing in an IDP camp with no spare clothes. I look at her with astonishment, and she shrugs. \"I'd still help him now if he asked,\" she says. \"He's my brother.\" </p> <p>But blind forgiveness only goes so far. Families are poor and stretched, and are used to the absence of their fighter in the family. \"If he wants to come back,\" says Allen Lincoln, who runs rehabilitation centres for child soldiers, \"how will they feed him? They can't even feed the kids they have.\" </p> <p>The disarmament process is supposed to help this - fighters who turn in their weapons receive $300 and rehabilitation training - but the first episode was a disaster. The UN was unprepared, and unarmed NGO workers faced 8,000 armed fighters who wanted their money on the spot. There was rioting and nine people died. There are other disincentives: in neighbouring Cote d'Ivoire, the disarmament programme offers $600 instead. To poor, bored ex-combatants, this is a red rag to travel. Armed, frustrated fighters on the move: it's not a peaceful prospect. </p> <p>Smith says he'll give in his weapon, find his parents, go home and be a mechanic. But like all his friends, he'll probably give up one weapon and keep another, just in case. Jackson has a shipping-container full, and no intention of being anyone's mechanic, because someone will pay her enough to fight again. \"Not here. I'll get $1,000 a month, at least. That's what my life is worth.\" She doesn't see the irony. </p> <p>\"We have a saying,\" says Mary Kamara, \"that all the devils have danced in Liberia.\" She's not sure whether the show's over, with people like Jackson around, or whether this is just the interval. But she'll give peace the benefit of the doubt, like Marline, Grace, Joanne and every other woman I meet. They have no choice. Woman da wat, in a Liberia on its knees? Woman da everything. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A Life Removed: Hunting for Refuge in the Modern World by Rose George is published by Penguin.</p>",
  "Vladimir Putin made a rare visit to Chechnya yesterday to support its pro-Moscow administration by laying a wreath at the grave of Akhmad Kadyrov, the Chechen president assassinated in May. <p>The visit, Mr Putin's second since the killing and the third of his presidency, was an attempt to bolster his claim that Russian-backed martial law has brought peace. </p> <p>It came ahead of an election to choose Mr Kadyrov's successor. Alu Alkhanov, the Chechen interior minister, and the Kremlin's choice, is expected to win. </p> <p>Mr Putin's visit was undermined by reports of persistent fighting between federal troops and separatists. </p> <p>Hours before Mr Putin landed at Kadyrov's home town of Tsentoroi to lay the red carnations, officials had reported clashes between militants and federal troops. </p> <p>One government official told the Associated Press news agency that more than 30 people had died, including 23 troops, when three polling stations were at tacked. Other officials said the figures were lower. </p> <p>Under intense security, Mr Putin was pictured on Russian television alongside Kadyrov's son and former chief of security, Ramzan Kadyrov, and Mr Alkhanov, marking what would have been Kadyrov's 53rd birthday. </p> <p>\"We lost a very courageous, talented and exceptionally decent person,\" state TV showed the president saying. </p> <p>Since Kadyrov's death, the Kremlin has almost beatified him, although he had been accused of brutality and corruption. </p> <p>Ramzan Kadyrov has sought a wider role since his father's death, even offering this weekend to send troops to help stem a conflict in neighbouring South Ossetia. Yet he is seen to lack his father's commanding presence in the republic.</p>",
  "An audit by international observers supported official election results that gave President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela victory in a referendum to recall him, the secretary general of the Organisation of American States said. <p>Although observers such as the former US president Jimmy Carter and the OAS secretary general, C\u00e9sar Gaviria, endorsed the election council's results for the August 15 vote, they proposed the audit to assuage the opposition's concerns of vote fraud. </p> <p>However, the opposition refused to participate in the audit, saying they did not believe the methodology was capable of detecting fraud. </p> <p>Mr Gaviria said: \"In our opinion, the type of check used in this audit of the electronic system doesn't leave us much doubt regarding the result. </p> <p>\"It's evident that the opposition has huge doubts regarding the results.

  "In 1953 Peter Brown, who has died aged 79, was a co-founder of the Liberal party of South Africa, and he was its chairman from 1958 to 1964. He had taken this task on to give Alan Paton, the party's first chairman, time to write. <p>No other party in that country's history had ever been freely formed by black and white together: the Communist party of 1921, on the orders of the Communist International, was initially all-white; and the African National Congress only admitted whites after going into exile in 1969. Brown was the warm human face of this culture of high principle. </p> <p>It is easy to say that his stock of integrity accumulated in direct proportion to his remoteness from state office. In 20th-century South Africa, British-descended anglophones have never got further than the wings of the stage; liberal English-speakers like Brown have barely reached the theatre door. That in the general election of 1958 he should have won more than one in 10 white voters in Pietermaritzburg District was an achievement, especially when official discourse equated \"liberal\" with \"communist\". In the new South Africa, where Brown had the satisfaction of seeing his ideals inform the constitution, a no less demented rhetoric all too often treats liberal as a synonym for \"racist\". </p> <p>Born in Durban, of an old and well-to-do Natal family, Brown was educated at Michaelhouse school in what is now KwaZulu-Natal. After wartime service in the 6th South African Armoured Division in north Africa and Italy, he began to read agriculture at Jesus College, Cambridge. </p> <p>Then the mixed-race South African writer Peter Abrahams, who had just published a novel set in the Johannesburg slums, came to Cambridge to speak, and Brown had gone with other South Africans to oppose him. In the event, it was Brown's outlook that was challenged. He gave up his studies, drove a car the length of Africa and in 1948, the year that the National Party won the \"apartheid election\", enrolled on a course in native law and administration at the University of Cape Town. </p> <p>After graduating, Brown was employed by the Natal midlands health commission. Under the state of emergency following the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, he was held without charge for 98 days. While his major political energies went into opposing forced removals among rural black people, the state chose to act against him, using unwelcome developments within his own party to turn (so it was hoped) public opinion against him: the disillusion of some younger white members with Gandhian methods and their espousal of sabotage. He was silenced by a \"banning\" order for 10 years from 1964; by the time of his unbanning the party had disbanded, rather than compromise, as Helen Suzman's Progressive party had done, with a 1968 law which forbade party-political activity across the colour line. </p> <p>During the next 30 years he edited the journal Reality; helped to finance legal defence in political trials; and founded the Association for Rural Advancement. There was one more public role: he was among a 1990s delegation that met members of the ANC-in-exile in Lusaka. </p> <p>Brown's good looks and his wry smile will forever be the outward sign of his inward qualities. I remember that blond head popping up at the funeral of a communist tailor from the Indian quarter of Pietermaritzburg in 1962 and delivering a eulogy. Fourteen years into the cold war, enough of the wartime anti-fascist spirit survived in South Africa for a known foe of communism to mourn one of its adherents. There will be hope for South Africa only if the new foes of liberalism show the same spirit, epitomised so grandly in the man we have lost. </p> <p>Brown is survived by his wife Phoebe and three children. </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Peter McKenzie Brown, farmer and political activist, born December 24 1924; died June 28 2004</p>",
  "Essential supplies were being ferried into Kathmandu yesterday under the protection of military helicopters, after Maoist rebels cut off Nepal's capital from the rest of the Himalayan kingdom for the fifth day. <p>On the main highway out of Kathmandu, the traffic consisted only of ambulances and army lorries carrying soldiers. </p> <p>The rebels' ability to isolate the capital by setting up a blockade has created fear and panic. Whereas 1,200 lorries a day normally enter the city, yesterday's trickle sent local prices spiralling. </p> <p>Less than a mile from the heavily-fortified but narrow Nag Dhunga pass, Jeevan Subedi said he had walked for two hours up the highway with medicine for an ill relative. </p> <p>\"What else can I do?\" he said. \"There are no buses, because people are too scared to take the risk of being attacked by the Maoists.\" </p> <p>Janardan Bhandari, who sells vegetables in Kathmandu's Kalimati market, said: \"No produce came today.\" </p> <p>Mr Bhandari said hauliers were either refusing to travel or were charging danger money, after a lorry driver who defied the blockade had his vehicle set ablaze. \"We are not yet running out but things are running short,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Last night an old man came here after walking with his cauliflower crop on his back for 16 hours. He charges more and so do we. Prices have risen by 75%.\" </p> <p>Until a few years ago, Nepal's civil war was fought out of the sight of the capital, which lies in a Himalayan valley surrounded by cloud-topped mountains. </p> <p>The \"people's war\", which has claimed 10,000 lives since 1996, pits a rebel force of an estimated 15,000 fighters against a Nepalese army of 80,000 soldiers, armed with sophisticated American and British weapons. </p> <p>But the Maoists control most of the countryside and are beginning to strangle the cities. </p> <p>Irritation at what seemed a faraway struggle has turned to anger in Kathmandu after the rebels detonated several bombs in the capital and shot dead a policeman on Saturday to enforce the blockade that has left thousands stranded and severely limited the flow of goods into and out of the capital. </p> <p>Yesterday, thousands took to the streets to protest against the Maoist tactics. </p> <p>Navraj Pokharel, 24, said his family had fled their village after the rebels shot dead his father. </p> <p>\"We have been made refugees in our own country,\" he said. \"We do not want this kind of terror.\" </p> <p>Experts said the rally, organised by the Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Industries and Commerce, appeared to be a political move to show the Maoists that the people of Kathmandu would blame them and not the government as the crisis deepened. </p> <p>This has not dissuaded the guerrillas from attacking other towns. Hundreds of rebels stormed a mountainous vil lage in the north-west, bombing government buildings and killing one soldier before the army repulsed the attack. </p> <p>Despite such attacks, it is the blockade of the capital which has wrong-footed the government. </p> <p>Ministers said last Friday that they would agree to one of the guerrillas' demands: to locate 17 missing trade unionists. But they declined to compensate the families of leftwing activists who had been killed by security forces, or to prosecute soldiers for extra-judicial murders. </p> <p>The guerrillas vowed to extend the siege to the Tibetan border. </p> <p>The showdown in reality pits the Maoists against the monarchy. </p> <p>King Gyanendra, who ascended to the throne after the crown prince shot dead his father and close family in June 2001, had promised elections but instead appointed politicians who would not disturb the status quo. </p> <p>The prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, had previously been sacked for incompetence. </p> <p>Worse still, there has been no movement in resurrecting the moribund peace process with the Maoist. </p> <p>\"We have a crisis developing and a government which appears not to know how to deal with it,\" said Padma Ratna Tuladhar, a former minister who mediated in the last peace process between the government and the Maoists. </p> <p>\"The rebels have made it clear they want elections to a parliament and a new constitution that does away with the monarchy. But on offer are talks only with the current constitutional set up. How do you expect the Maoists to talk on that basis?\"</p>",
  "<p>Someone asked David Moyes if this win was a turning point in Everton's season. The manager, with more respect than was due, suggested it was a bit soon to be talking in such terms. Nonetheless the victory equalled their total away last season. </p> <p>The turning point, after a summer of boardroom dispute and distraction as they flounder in \u00a340m debt, may have to come off the field first, be it from Russia with love or elsewhere; players these days are mere shelf-stackers and check-out staff in the great game of supermarket takeovers. </p> <p>But the match had a turning point that may be as seminal as the pass by Oxford's Kevin Brock in January 1984 that let in Everton for a late League Cup draw and gave their manager Howard Kendall a stay of execution that was followed by a period of great achievement. It may be as seminal for Palace. </p> <p>For almost 20 minutes they had Everton on the rack, pulling them wide and cutting through the middle with Andy Johnson's pace while Everton packed as much punch as pom-pom girls. Then Julian Speroni, Palace's Argentinian keeper, dribbled in his area, was challenged by Kevin Campbell and ended up fouling him. Everton were level, morale and momentum exchanged. </p> <p>Iain Dowie resisted the clich\u00e9 of promoted managers that the difference at the higher level is that errors get punished and said they were a \"no-blame club\", adding: \"Julian has quick feet.\" Not quick enough to out-smart Campbell tells another story. And John Harbin, the fitness coach, wrote in the programme on how they focus on focus. Speroni will have to learn fast. </p> <p>So may Ivan Kaviedes. He was brought on at 2-1 down against 10 men after Gary Naysmith had been sent off for a second foul. As Dowie disdained cautious convention and chased the game with a switch from 4-4-2 to 3-4-1-2, the Ecuadorean was the one. \"He has a good change of pace,\" said Dowie - from torpid to sluggish presumably. </p> <p>Dowie, an aeronautical engineer, is bullishly refreshing. He propelled Palace through the First Division last season with fierce intensity. It may be rocket science. It is certainly founded on fitness, focus and spirit. </p> <p>Fitz Hall looked a useful midfield addition, Wayne Routledge was lively in the manner of Shaun Wright-Phillips and crossed for Mark Hudson's opener but Everton were comfortable once they cut off the supply to Johnson's willing and intelligent running. </p> <p>Dowie said they need to be brighter in the boxes but Everton's open-play goals came from a growing midfield control exerted by Thomas Gravesen and aided by Kevin Kilbane. Moyes said of the Dane that \"some things he does make you tear your hair out\" - perhaps his own too - but his second goal was a beauty from 25 yards and he laid on Marcus Bent's. </p> <p>Moyes, uncommonly demonstrative at the end, said his players, \"in the face of other things happening at the club, had stood up and answered back\". Now he must hope the board answers back before the deadline with decent cash for rejuvenating players. And that may be up to Boris or whoever today. </p> <p>Dowie looks to tomorrow, for his third of \"38 Cup finals\", against Chelsea. \"It's a massive game against the riches of avarice,\" he said. Palace, in the language of the day, are not looking to \"podium\" this season. They will do well just to pontoon. </p> <p>Man of the match: Wayne Routledge (Crystal Palace)</p>",
  "<p>Apart from the toe-curling sight of Mohamed Al Fayed attempting to dance in the pre-match singalong, the Fulham family did not put a foot wrong on their homecoming after two years' exile. Nothing was missing, save for around 5,000 fans who stayed away from an occasion demanding a full house. </p> <p>It can be argued that SW6 is not big enough to house two Premiership clubs, especially with the blue monster lurking round the corner. But floating fans should not be afraid to test the water at Fulham's refurbished riverside home. </p> <p>Fulham have their own multinational squad under the guidance of their own young, thrusting manager. Understandably Andy Cole received most of the accolades for his own piece of history-making, marking up his double century of league goals at the club where this scoring sequence started 13 years ago while on loan at Fulham from Arsenal. </p> <p>On this evidence, Chris Coleman has successfully gambled in taking a 32-year-old striker whose career appeared in steep decline at Blackburn. In Cole, Fulham's manager believes he has found \"the predator\" lacking since the sale of Louis Saha. \"Cole's got that arrogance. He always believes he'll get in and score.\" </p> <p>Coleman seems to have exercised good judgment with all the four home debutants - acquired for less than \u00a35m - who thrived in a fluid, attractive performance that overwhelmed a Bolton side receiving precisely the treatment they meted out on opening day. \"The defending was abysmal,\" said Sam Allardyce, which was just one of his forthright criticisms. </p> <p>The influence of Jay-Jay Okocha, whose first-minute shot was parried by a startled Edwin van der Sar, eventually waned, which reflected well on Fulham's own midfielders, notably Bouba Diop. </p> <p>This is a name to note, according to Coleman, just in case anyone had forgotten the Senegalese defensive midfielder's goal that beat France in the 2002 World Cup opener. Manchester United showed interest and Portsmouth had a contract ready before Fulham acted decisively, signing Diop from Lens for about \u00a31.5m. </p> <p>\"He's 6ft 4in, got good pace, a great engine and he's very strong,\" said Coleman. Is there a downside to Diop? \"He got 12 to 13 bookings and was sent off three or four times in the French League. He'll probably upset a lot of people here - but I don't mind that.\" </p> <p>Diop utterly outshone his listless Bolton counterpart, Iv\u00e1n Campo, and it is no wonder that Allardyce is trying to recruit another defensive midfielder, Emmanuel Petit. Allardyce is still hopeful of signing Petit from Chelsea, despite the Frenchman saying that he has already rejected Bolton, claiming that the club attempted to change details of their original offer. </p> <p>Here, Fulham concluded their business emphatically, Cole slipping away and shooting fiercely from Claus Jensen's oblique pass for his landmarkgoal some 77 minutes after fortuitously diverting Zat Knight's shot for the opener. Sylvain Legwinski hit the woodwork, as did Cole. But such failings were soon forgotten by the Fulham faithful. </p> <p><strong> Man of the match</strong> : Andy Cole (Fulham)</p>",
  "<p>Andy D'Urso's status as a Premiership referee is set to be withdrawn after he failed to send off Barry Ferguson despite twice booking the Blackburn captain. </p> <p>The referees' select group manager Keith Hackett has launched an investigation into the incident and a suspension is considered inevitable. Hackett declared it \"a basic error\" and said the Football Association is likely to mirror his own inquiry by probing \"a failure to apply the law\". He will also interrogate D'Urso over a series of questionable decisions during the match. </p> <p>The referee awarded Southampton a dubious match-winning penalty for a routine aerial challenge by Craig Short. Ferguson was then shown a second yellow card for flicking the ball away. </p> <p>After James Beattie scored from the spot, D'Urso was alerted by the fourth official that Ferguson had been cautioned twice, but the Scot was allowed to remain on the field. </p> <p>Hackett said: \"The procedure for a referee at any level is to inform the player he is being cautioned, to ask his name and record it in the notebook. If these principles had been followed, this basic error would not have occurred.\" </p> <p>The referee can expect up to a month on the sidelines; it is not the first time D'Urso's performance has attracted scrutiny. Following Tottenham's third-round FA Cup win over Crystal Palace last season, D'Urso was sanctioned for sending off Danny Butterfield for a foul he did not commit. </p> <p>D'Urso's suspension on that occasion, served secretly in the absence of a formal announcement, will leave him in no doubt about the consequences of his latest blunder. D'Urso is likely now to be dropped from the select group of 24 Premier League referees. The official refused to comment after the match. </p> <p>The last-minute penalty might have served to alleviate some of the mounting pressure on Southampton's manager Paul Sturrock, however his position hardly appears more secure for the three points. </p> <p>The chairman Rupert Lowe failed to endorse Sturrock's stewardship after the match, saying: \"[He] remains the manager until the time that the board decides otherwise. All managers are driven by results. We have got Paul Sturrock managing the club and that is good enough for us.\" </p> <p>Those comments will do nothing to alter the suspicion that Sturrock will be dismissed if Bolton's visit to St Mary's on Wednesday does not also produce three points. For this was an unconvincing display from the home side. </p> <p>Having taken the lead after the Blackburn defence failed to deal with a long ball into the box from Paul Telfer, allowing Kevin Phillips to pounce unchallenged from six yards out, Southampton showed no composure. Tackles were missed in a frenetically open match that could have gone either way. </p> <p>With the painfully slow Dominic Matteo inexplicably selected in Blackburn's left-wing position, Southampton should have concentrated their attacks down that flank but Sturrock failed to spot the weakness. Instead, following the half-time introduction of Paul Dickov, the visitors were allowed back into the game. </p> <p>The former Leicester striker provided Ferguson with his goal with a sumptuous through-ball, before scoring himself with a calm finish from Brett Emerton's cross. </p> <p>Anders Svensson restored parity for Southampton with a well-struck effort before Beattie stole the points. </p> <p>Yet there is currently something of a malaise at Southampton. The managerial situation is disturbing for the players and, with Beattie angling for a move away from the south coast, the club's main asset is unsettled. </p> <p>Svensson, however, put a brave face on and said that the atmosphere in the dressing room was great. Sturrock, a jovial and likeable man, will have done everything to foster that \"great atmosphere\" but, like D'Urso, he is out of his depth in the Premiership. </p> <p><strong> Man of the match</strong> : Paul Dickov</p>",
  "<p><strong>9.55pm</strong> Late update on the gymnastics, rioting was narrowly avoided after the crowd jeered the judges' marking of Alexei Nemov's performance on the horizontal bar. </p> <p>The judges originally gave Nemov a score of 9.725, but after a delay of 10 minutes when the crowd voiced their disapproval, the Russian's score was upgraded to 9.762. A fantastic display of people power from the land that invented democracy. </p> <p>In the end it didn't matter, Nemov finished in fifth place, Igor Cassina of Italy won with a 9.812, ahead of the all-round competition winner Paul Hamm. Japan's Isao Yoneda took the bronze.</p> <p><strong>8.30pm</strong> Kelly Holmes steps up to the podium to receive her gold medal. She mumbles along to the beginning of the national anthem, gives up to grin through the middle and finishes it off with a token \"... save the Queen\" at the end. She looks delighted and she should, a great result for an athlete that thoroughly deserves it. And she's still fot the 1,500m tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>8.20pm</strong> Margaret Defar of Ethiopia takes the 5,000m ahead of Isabella Ochichi of Kenya and Tirunesh Dibaba also of Ethiopia. They broke the field after setting a brutal pace in the middle laps. Jo Pavey finishes strongly to take fifth place. Sonia O'Sullivan is lapped, but still comes home smiling</p> <p><strong>8.10pm</strong>The women's 5,000m got off to a slow start before the Chinese athletes combined to force the pace. Sonia O'Sullivan is way off the pace, obviously feeling the effects of her tough qualifying round. Britain's Jo Pavey kept up for the first few laps but is now lagging.</p> <p><strong>7.55pm:</strong> Dean Macey has won his heat of the 400m, clocking a time of 48.99secs. It was another good performance by the Essex boy after a gruelling day. He will go into tomorrow morning's 110m hurdles in fourth place, 100 points behind Bryan Clay in third. Dmitri Karpov leads the competition, with Czech Republic's Roman Sebrle in second place.</p> <p>Francoise Mbango, of Cameroon, has denied Hrysopiyi Devetzi glory in front of her home crowd, pipping her by five centimetres in the women's triple jump with a leap of 15.30m. Tatyana Lebedeva was third for Russia.</p> <p>Right, it's time for me to pass you onto my colleague Tom Lutz. Many thanks for your emails, Mike.</p> <p><strong>7.40pm:</strong> As promised, here are the standings in the decathlon after four events:</p> <p>1 Dmitri Karpov (Kaz) 3721pts<br> 2 Bryan Clay (USA) 3702pts<br> 3 Roman Sebrle (Cze) 3702pts<br> 4 Dean Macey (Gbr) 3591pts<br> 5 Claston Bernard (Jam) 3553pts<br> 6 Tom Pappas (USA) 3504pts<br> 7 Chiel Warners (Ned) 3476pts<br> 8 Attila Zsivoczky (Hun) 3452pts<br> 9 Aleksandr Pogorelov (Rus) 3415pts<br> 10 Jaakko Ojaniemi (Fin) 3405pts</p> <p>So Dean Macey has risen three places to fourth following his terrific high jump. Dmitri Karpov has just run the 400m in 46.81secs, but Bryan Clay was considerably slower in 49.19secs. Another good performance from Macey could see him in a medal position overnight.</p> <p><strong>7.30pm:</strong> Dean Macey is jumping tremendously. Having sailed over 2.12m, he is now taking on 2.15m. No other decathlete has jumped higher. And he's done it. 2.15m - truly phenomenal. He is going to make up so many points with this leap, and he may choose to retire from the high jump to conserve energy for the last event of the day, the 400m. Leader Brian Clay could only manage 2.06m earlier. Full standings after four events will follow shortly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Tim Walton has picked me up on my ignorance of the music in the Olympic stadium. \"'Dancing Queen' was played whilst the winner of the Heptathlon, Carolina Kluft did her victory lap of the stadium.\" Maybe Matthew Syed was right all along.</p> <p><strong>7.18pm:</strong> Jeremy Warriner has won the men's 400m final in an American 1-2-3. The time of 44.01secs is the fastest run since Michael Johnson retired. Guess who Warriner's coach is - yes, Johnson. Otis Harris and Derrick Brew completed the sweep for the US.</p> <p>Sara Williams is delighted with the 800m result. \"I'm shaking and hoarse having screamed at the tv for two minutes. Could not have gone to a better athlete. Brilliant race - is there anyone who reads a race better?\" Sara, I don't think there is. It was a truly exceptional performance.</p> <p><strong>7.05pm:</strong> What a race it was. Jearl-Miles Clark took the field out in a ridiculously fast first lap, while Holmes, Mutola and Ceplak sat off the pace about fifteen metres back. Slowly Holmes and Mutola went past the field one by one, until the two hit the front coming off the final bend. Giving it their all down the last 100m they matched each other stride for stride, but Holmes was too strong, moving half a yard ahead near the line. Suddenly danger came in the shape of Ceplak and Benhassie, who were both finishing faster than Mutola and Holmes, but the tape just came quickly enough for Holmes to seize the moment she has been waiting for all her career. There were just thirteen hundredths of a second separating the first four. No chance to catch breath, it's time for the men's 400m final. </p> <p><strong>7pm:</strong> <strong>GOLD FOR GREAT BRITAIN</strong> Kelly Holmes has won the 800m. In a fantastic race she was in last place at the bell, but steadily moved up through the field and was involved in a titanic sprint finish with Maria Mutola down the home straight, eventually pipping her training partner on the line in a photo finish involing four athletes. She cannot believe it, but it certainly is true: Kelly Holmes is the Olympic champion. Mutola finished fourth and misses out on the medals, Benhassie taking silver and Jolenda Ceplak bronze.</p> <p><strong>6.50pm:</strong> Dean Macey has now cleared two metres in the decathlon high jump and looks like he could go considerably higher. Brian Clay and Dmitri Karpov, who were first and second after three events, have both cleared 2.03m so Macey still has some work to do.</p> <p>Joyce Maduaka was unable to join her team-mate Oyepitan in the 200m semi-finals. She found it difficult in lane eight, eventually finishing fifth. Slovenia's Merlene Ottey was fourth, and must wait to see if she is one of the fastest losers. Regarding Ottey's switch of national allegiance, I'm sure the Slovenian media didn't whinge about it as much as we did when Malachi Davis chose to run for Britain in the 400m. They probably just accepted the rules and the fact national federations cannot break them without strict consequences.</p> <p>Kelly Holmes is about to run in the 800m. She is expected to win a medal, but Mozambique's greatest ever sportswoman, Maria Mutola, is strong favourite for the gold. Incidentally, Mozambique's greatest ever sportsman is Eusebio.</p> <p><strong>6.40pm:</strong> Abi Oyepitan has continued her fine form, running powerfully into second place in the second round of the 200m. Her time was 22.79. She will now fancy her chances of making it through the semis tomorrow for her first Olympic final. She missed out on a place in the 100m final on Saturday by just a whisker.</p> <p><strong>6.25pm:</strong> Sailors Chris Draper and Simon Hiscocks are in silver medal position after they were placed fourth in the 12th race of the mixed 49er class. Spain lead the rankings, with Ukraine in third.</p> <p>Jamaica's Veronica Campbell won the first heat of the women's 200m.</p> <p>Oh, and Mike Higton has brought the Matthew Syed commentary debacle back to life. \"Matthew Syed also said during Jan-Ove Waldner's quarter-final that 'Dancing Queen' (which was playing in the background at some point) would become the anthem of these Olympic Games.\" I'm yet to hear it in the Olympic stadium, but my ears are pricked up just in case.</p> <p><strong>6.10pm:</strong> Matt Douglas is out of the men's 400m hurdles after coming home sixth in his heat. Kemel Thompson of Jamaica won the race. Hrysopiyi Devetzi has sent the home crowd wild by jumping 15.14m in the triple jump. She lies second at the halfway stage.</p> <p><strong>6pm:</strong> Brazil have beaten Australia 2-0 in the first semi-final of the women's beach volleyball. They will play an American duo in the final, as the other semi-final consists of two pairs of athletic ladies from the United States.</p> <p>Felix Sanchez has just won the fourth heat of the 400m hurdles in a time of 48.5secs. The Dominican Republic athlete, favourite for gold, wore a red and blue lycra suit which made him look like Spiderman, but his performance was impressive in the extreme. Chris Rawlinson reckons he can beat Sanchez. I don't.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Joe Waters is distraught. \"Blimey, is it illegal to have too much testosterone?\" he wonders. \"Isn't this feminism gone too far?\" It could well be.</p> <p><strong>5.50pm:</strong> Andrew Haines asks impatiently: \"Is Dean Macey back on yet? Canvey Island is getting very excited about bringing its first medal home from the Olympics.\" Actually, Andrew, he is, and he's going great guns in the high jump. He easily cleared 1.85m before flying over 1.91m. If he can add a few more centimetres, and have a good 400m in which he is always strong, he will not be far off a medal position overnight.</p> <p><strong>5.40pm:</strong> Chris Rawlinson finished third in the heat. He looked comfortable leading round the final bend, but took his foot off the gas too early and paid the price for his complacency. Angelo Taylor was first in a time of 48.80 and Jiri Muzik second. Danny MacFarlane of Jamaica won the second heat despite having an horrific hurdling technique.</p> <p><strong>5.30pm:</strong> The American softball team have thrashed Australia 5-1 to clinch their third successive gold medal. America, led by superstar Jenny Finch, had not conceded a run before the final today.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Great Britain have been involved in a ten goal thriller in their final hockey group match against Pakistan. Unfortunately, Britain only scored two of the ten goals, though they were 1-0 up. Hence they lost 8-2. </p> <p>Chris Rawlinson is about to start his campaign for a 400m hurdles medal when he runs in the first heat of the first round. He is up against the reigning champion, Angelo Taylor.</p> <p><strong>5.20pm:</strong> Iain Percy and Steve Mitchell have been back on the water today at Piraeus, finishing sixth in the fifth race of the Keelbent class. They are ranked ninth overall.</p> <p>Joe Waters has stopped laughing long enough to write: \"John Inverdale made another gaff on Radio 5 Live the other day claiming that Kelly Holmes trains by running 90,000 kilometres a week. About three and a half times round the circumference of the earth then.\"</p> <p><strong>5.10pm:</strong> Hello again, sorry about that little glitch. The action has started on the track with the women's 100m hurdles second round. Perdita Felicien of Canada won the first semi-final in a fine time of 12.50secs. Bridgette Fraser, one of the favourites for gold, has withdrawn from the second semi-final, which was won by Joanna Hayes of America in an even more impressive time of 12.48secs.</p> <p>\"In a swimming relay,\" Jonathan Cardy says, \"the swimmers who help the team get into the final in the earlier heats are awarded a medal if the team eventually wins one, whether they take part or not. Why does this not apply for the cyclists? All seems incredibly unfair and not in the Olympic spirit at all.\" Hear hear.</p>",
  "<p>The UK journalist held by Israeli authorities since her attempted arrival in the country 12 days ago, faces further time behind bars after a district court postponed a decision on her future today.</p> <p>Ewa Jasiewicz, a 26-year old correspondent for leftwing magazine Red Pepper, was condemned to spending at least three more days in an Israeli detention centre after the court failed to decide on whether she should be allowed into the country or deported.</p> <p>Jasiewicz was detained at Tel Aviv airport on August 11 after the Israeli authorities objected to her past connection to the pro-Palestinian International Solidarity Movement, claiming she was a \"political activist\" whose reports \"would not be objective\".</p> <p>The 26-year old is a former member of the non-violent ISM, described by the Israeli government as a \"terrorist organisation\". Her eyewitness reports of Israeli atrocities have also angered authorities.</p> <p>Two years ago she witnessed the extra-judicial killing of a 13-year-old Palestinian boy, Baha al-Bahesh, by members of the Israeli Defence Force, and her accounts have received widespread international press coverage.</p> <p>After being detained at Tel Aviv airport she was interrogated by defence ministry officials and later told that she would be deported. </p> <p>At an appeal against the decision on Friday, an Israeli court ruled that she should be free to enter Israel on condition that she paid bail of \u00a33,800 and did not enter the West Bank or Gaza. </p> <p>Just hours after the case, however, the government appealed to the Israeli supreme court, hich reversed the original decision. </p> <p>At a subsequent supreme-court hearing yesterday the case was batted back down to the district court, which re-heard the case this morning.</p> <p>Jasiewicz's lawyer, Yael Berda, said: \"A decision will now not be made until Wednesday morning at 8.30am.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy in London declined to give reason why the lower court had deferred the decision, but said there were \"good reasons\" behind her detention.</p> <p>But Berda accused the Israeli authorities of flouting international law.</p> <p>\"The detention shows that the authorities can really do whatever they want. The whole issue of free speech is really a problem here,\" she said, adding that if Jasiewicz was deported, she would \"appeal all the way\".</p> <p>Red Pepper editor Hilary Wainwright said she would be writing to Jack Straw in a bid to get the foreign secretary to intervene on Jasiewicz's behalf.</p> <p>\"It is incredible that the Israeli government is keeping a journalist captive for fear of what she might report,\" she said last week. </p> <p>\"It is an outrage, an assault on the freedom of the press. I call on Jack Straw to make the strongest protest to the Israeli government and to do everything he can to ensure that Ewa is able to do her job and report from Israel and Palestine.\" </p> <p>Even the National Federation of Israeli Journalists, which rarely acts ont eh behalf of foreign reporters, condemned her detention. </p> <p>\"The arrest of foreign journalists and the limiting of their journalistic work causes damage to the good name of Israel. This damage is 10 times greater than biased or even hostile reporting, the NFIJ said in a letter to Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon</p> <p>\"Israel takes pride in being the only democracy in the Middle East and for its freedom of the press. It needs to allow this freedom also for foreign journalists.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Great Britain had to settle for silver after losing to Australia at the Olympic Velodrome in Athens today.</p> <p>The quartet of individual pursuit champion Bradley Wiggins, Rob Hayles, Paul Manning and Steve Cummings were beaten by an Australian line-up which justified their favourites tag. </p> <p>The British team had qualified for the gold/silver final with their first ever sub-four-minute mark in the 4,000m event but the Australians had gone one better by beating their own world record to reach the final. In the event the team from down under were more than two and a half seconds ahead of their rivals in a time of 3:58.233.</p> <p>The British team used a higher gear in a bid to counter the Australian team who had beaten them in the final of the last two World Championships. But the tactic was not enough as they were never ahead and they were almost two seconds down at the half-way point and well over three seconds back at the finish.</p> <p>Rob Hayles, who was in the team which won bronze in the event four years ago, said: \"It's good to be back but I'm starting to get sick of hearing the other finishing gun go off. But it's a silver medal to add to my bronze.\" </p> <p>In the final heat for bronze, Spain beat Germany with a time of 4:05.523.</p>",
  "<p>HBOS today assumed a spoiler's role in Santander Central Hispano's \u00a38.3bn takeover of Abbey National by highlighting the Spanish bank's ties to the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p> <p>HBOS - which has indicated an interest in making a counterbid for Abbey - said it would write to the European commission to express its concern about cross-shareholdings between RBS and Santander.</p> <p>\"In the event that SCH acquires Abbey National, we believe that it would be unhealthy for board directors from both banks to sit on each other's boards,\" HBOS said. </p> <p>\"At a very minimum, we believe that the cross-director representation should cease. Despite what the companies say, it is hard to ignore the fact that any cross-director representation looks like a cosy gentlemen's club.\" </p> <p>Santander has had ties with RBS since 1988, and each company's chairman sits on the other's board. Royal Bank owns 2.8% of RBS - Spain's largest bank - which has a 5.1% stake in Royal Bank, Britain's second biggest. </p> <p>A spokesman for Santander said it would be prepared to alter its ties with Royal Bank if the competition authorities required it to do so. However, the spokesman added that he did not believe Santander's bid for Abbey would require a change to its links with Royal Bank because they already compete in several markets. </p> <p>HBOS said the bank would also ask the commission to verify that Royal Bank and Santander had no verbal or written agreement that would allow Royal Bank to take on any of Abbey's back-office operations in the event of a Santander takeover of Abbey. </p> <p>Alastair Gorrie, a competition partner at law firm Coudert Brothers, said the European commission - which is currently examining Santander's application to bid for Abbey - would now have to look at the issue of the Spanish bank's ties to RBS. \"HBOS have spotted a good card to play. The cross-shareholdings at that level are unlikely to cause a problem,\" Mr Gorrie told Reuters. \"But I would have thought that it [cross-director representation] might do, because it does give them access to confidential information and strategic planning.\" </p> <p>Prior to the HBOS announcement, the commission was expected to clear the takeover, because the deal does not appear to raise competition issues over market dominance.</p> <p>Santander also plans to cut around 3,000 jobs at Abbey if its bid is approved. Its chairman, Emilio Botin, speaking to representatives of Abbey's trade unions, said the job cuts were necessary to achieve \u20ac450m (\u00a3302.2m) in savings in three years.</p> <p>Mr Botin said the Spanish bank had already written to the head of the trustees who manage Abbey's pension fund, saying it would safeguard staff pension rights and offer 100 Santander shares each to Abbey employees if the takeover bid was successful.</p> <p>It was reported at the weekend that Santander would drop its offer for Abbey if rival bids resulted in a drawn-out competition investigation, because it feared a lengthy inquiry would create uncertainty and damage Abbey's business. </p> <p>The bank has indicated it would let its bid lapse in the event of a six-month competition investigation - giving Abbey shareholders a stark choice between a certain takeover by Santander and a possible higher bid from a British rival. Santander's deal will lapse if not completed by March 31.</p>",
  "Today is the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition - an event of particular importance this year because 2004 is the UN's International Year to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and its Abolition. <p>Yet slavery continues: millions of women, children and men throughout the world are enslaved and no region is free from this abuse, even though it is illegal under international law. </p> <p>Slavery takes many forms. Boys as young as four are abducted from their families in South Asia to be used as camel jockeys in the United Arab Emirates; in west Africa young girls are used as domestic slaves while women are brought to western Europe and forced into prostitution.</p> <p>Human trafficking is the fastest growing form of slavery. A 2004 US government report estimates that around 800,000 people are trafficked across borders each year. (The figure does not include those trafficked within their countries.) </p> <p>The traffickers prey on people in impoverished areas who are excluded from opportunities or are in societies destroyed by war and other turmoil. </p> <p>Promising well-paid work or education and training unobtainable at home, they lure, trick and coerce people who are desperate to improve their lives into conditions to which they never agreed.</p> <p>Leela's experience is characteristic. Taken from India to the UK and promised well-paid work as a domestic servant, she was made to work from 6.30am to 11.30pm every day with only one hour off each week. </p> <p>She was forced to sleep on the kitchen floor and her employers locked her in the house when they went out. They took her passport, telling her that if she left her job she would be deported back to India. She had been promised \u00a3150 per week but she received nothing.</p> <p>The drafting of the Council of Europe's European Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings provides a valuable opportunity to protect victims of this crime throughout the EU</p> <p>For the convention to be truly effective, however, it must have at its heart measures that safeguard human rights. These include a requirement that member states allow trafficked people to stay in their countries for at least three months. Such a delay would allow victims to begin to recover from their ordeal and make informed decisions about their future. </p> <p>During this period, governments should provide access to a full range of services, including access to medical help, training and education, employment opportunities and financial support. </p> <p>Trafficked people also need to be granted renewable short-term residence permits, and those would be especially vulnerable if sent back home must be given the chance of permanent residence.</p> <p>Migrants are at particular risk because many developed countries' governments fail to acknowledge the growing demand for migrant labour. The International Organisation for Migration estimates that the original 15 EU states will need 68 million more foreign workers by 2050 just to stabilise their existing workforces due to ageing populations and declining birthrates. </p> <p>Despite this, some EU countries are imposing more restrictive immigration controls that make regular migration more difficult. This in turn increases the demand for smuggling and trafficking. </p> <p>Facilitating regular migration and protecting the human and labour rights of migrants are important steps in reducing trafficking in people. One step governments should take is signing or ratifying the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families, which no EU member state has done to date. </p> <p>This convention seeks to prevent and eliminate \"the clandestine movements and trafficking in migrant workers\" and extend the protection of human rights law to all migrant workers and their families throughout the migration process.</p> <p>It is vital European governments take steps to protect those who are most vulnerable to trafficking and help those who are victims of this crime.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Beth Herzfeld is press officer of the organisation Anti-Slavery International</p>",
  "The Green party are to field a student to take on the education secretary, Charles Clarke, at the next general election, it was announced today. <p>Adrian Ramsey, who is already a councillor for the party in the Norwich South constituency as well as a postgraduate at the University of East Anglia, was chosen by the party - and has pledged to make top-up fees his \"number one issue\".</p> <p>The 23-year-old is studying for a masters in politics, and says the issue of fees makes Mr Clarke a \"sitting target\" for the town's 10,000 student population.</p> <p>At the last general election the Greens came fourth, increasing their vote by 2%, while Labour slipped 6%. However, it would still take an electoral earthquake for the Greens to seriously dent Mr Clarke's 9,000-strong majority.</p> <p>Mr Ramsey, however, points to the five council seats his party now has within Mr Clarke's constituency - including the education secretary's own Nelson ward.</p> <p>\"The entire campus of the University of East Anglia is within Norwich South, and the majority of the 10,000 students live there too,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Top-up fees were incredibly unpopular in the education secretary's seat, and now voters have the chance to tell him what they think of them.\"</p> <p>Although the party has yet to win a Westminster seat, it has scored better under elections held under proportional representation, with two MEPs, two London Assembly members and seven seats in the Scottish parliament.</p> <p>The party's number one target is Brighton Pavilion, currently held by Labour's David Lepper.</p> <p>The Green candidate, who has been a local councillor for the past two years, said Norwich South was now \"in the top five of Green target seats\".</p> <p>\"We can definitely make inroads and send Mr Clarke a strong message,\" he said. \"We want to send Greens to parliament as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>\"Labour wasn't listening to the majority of the population when they introduced top-up fees in their mid-term. Now people can make their voices heard at the ballot box, and hopefully the Green party will benefit.\"</p> <p>Mr Ramsay, who was the youngest councillor to be elected in the city, will also challenge Mr Clarke on SATs, the Iraq war, public services and animal protection.</p> <p>He said: \"The government has concentrated its attention and money on waging an unwanted war with Iraq whilst completely neglecting to tackle climate change, animal protection and trade injustice - here and abroad.\"</p> <p>Although the Tories came second in 2001, they currently hold none of the ward seats in Mr Clarke's constituency. </p> <p>The city council is under no overall control, but the Liberal Democrats, who came third in 2001 with 22.6% of the vote, are the largest party group.</p>",
  "<p><strong>5.05pm</strong> I've run out of space here, so am switching to another page. Bear with me.</p> <p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> It's a bit quiet at the moment, though Dean Macey should be competing in the high jump shortly. He lies seventh in the decathlon after three disciplines. So to more of your emails. \"Did anyone else notice the fat American guy in the crowd who refused to give Gatlin his USA flag after the final last night?\", James Coney asks. \"He leaned over the railing to give Gatlin a hug, but when Gatlin tried to take the guy's flag to do his lap of honour the fat guy snatched it back. Gatlin tried again, but the fat guy moved it out of his reach!\" I wouldn't give him my flag either.</p> <p>James Peterson has an explanation for Radcliffe's disappointment yesterday. \"I reckon Paul looks like a thin version of judo player Kate Howey. I ain't no conspiracy theorist,\" he says as he sniffs the air for conspiacy, \"but has anyone ever seen them together? I reckon that could explain her failure.\" The Beeb have just been replaying Paula's interview with Steve Cram - it really was heart-wrenching to watch, with Paula believing she had let the country down. Not in my opinion, Paula.</p> <p><strong>4.40pm:</strong> The women's beach volleyball semi-finals will see an all-American match-up, and a clash of the titans between Australia and Brazil. Craig Doyle wants to know why Britain is no good at this sport - perhaps it's because playing on the beaches at Blackpool is not quite like having a run-around on the Copacobana, Malibu or the Gold Coast.</p> <p>It seems we've all got it in for Matthew Syed today (ok, admittedly I started it). John-Paul Wilson found the following especially rib-tickling: \"Not exactly a gaffe so much as a literary analysis - Syed started talking about the 'narrative structure' of a table tennis match being best when an attacking player met a defensive player.\"</p> <p><strong>4.30pm:</strong> The British cycling team have been presented with their silver medals, though only the four who raced in the final. This means Brian Steele and Chris Newton, who contributed to the team making the last two, do not win a memento of their achievement. Is this unfair?</p> <p>\"The old man (Paul Dickinson?!) who commentated on the men's 100m final said 'there are now four Jamaicans who have failed to win the Olympic gold'. Maybe more like 40 million?\" Well, I'm sure he'd be delighted to be conisdered an old man, Jamie Kenwood, but an astute observation nonetheless.</p> <p><strong>4.20pm:</strong> Laurent Gane, Rene Wolff, Theo Bos and Ryan Bayley have all won their cycling sprint quarter-finals. They consquently move into the semi-finals. It's not rocket-science, you know?</p> <p>Meanwhile, John Browne has pointed out that Matthew Syed also claimed Jan-Ove Waldner was \"one of the greatest sportsmen that has ever lived\". What do you mean, \"Who is Jan-Ove Waldner?\" Read below if you don't know, but you should anyway because apparently his name is up there in the pantheon of sporting greats. Ali, Bradman, Pele, Waldner...</p> <p><strong> 4.10pm: </strong> Greek Olympic officials are to launch an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the positive doping test that cost weightlifter Leonidas Sampanis a bronze medal. Sampanis's sample contained twice the legal amount of testosterone.</p> <p>Anna Seddon needs to get something off her chest. \"I heard Jonathan Edwards describe the decathelete Roman Chebrele this morning as 'a great all rounder',\" she fumes, still trying to remove the brick from her television. \"Of course he's a great all rounder, Edwards, he's a flaming decathlete.\" Hope you feel better now, Anna.</p> <p><strong>4.00pm:</strong> The cycling sprint quarter-finals are continuing in the velodome after that anti-climactic team final. This discipline is most entertaining, with the cyclists eyeing each other up with acute suspicion for the first few laps, in much the same way as Dougal of Father Ted fame used to study his parallel counterpart from Rugged Island when he was trying to get one over on him. The elderly priests' football match when Ted gave Dougal the job of protecting the corner flags particularly springs to mind.</p> <p>Deena Kastor, the American who was third in yesterday's marathon, has entered the debate as to whether our Paula should run the 10,000m on Friday, saying she would do herself proud if she made it to the track.</p> <p>More commentator gaffes. \"During Bradley Wiggins' gold medal ceremony the commentator said that the gold medal went to Bradley McGee (the Australian Wiggins beat in the final),\" Tom Freke sniggers. \"I guess it was Wiggins' fault for having the same name as McGee.\" Maybe the master of the medal ceremony for the team pursuit will reverse this mistake, and our boys will jump up to the podium in the gold medal position.</p> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> The British cyclists look gutted, though according to Chris Boardman they knew they only had a \"30% chance\". How did you work that out then, Chris? The Australians, meanwhile, are blubbering like babies.</p> <p>James Coney is a hockey fan who is not too impressed with the sport's commentary. He recalls that Bob Ballard claimed during Britain's match with Egypt: \"That is excellent play from the cool experienced head of Barry Middleton. He's 19 years old, playing in his first Olympics.\" An interesting paradox.</p> <p>Incidentally, Nick Dempsey has his final windsurfing race on Wednesday afternoon when he will be looking to climb into the medals.</p> <p><strong>3.43pm:</strong> <strong>SILVER FOR GREAT BRITAIN</strong> The Aussies have won by over three seconds. They set off on world record pace, and despite losing a man at the end of the third kilometre, they continued to move away from the British quartet. The Brits clocked a good time of 4:01mins, but it was not enough to defeat this formidable team.</p> <p><strong>3.40pm:</strong> Australia lead by 1.5secs at the half-way stage.</p> <p><strong>3.35pm:</strong> Spain have beaten Germany by 1.67secs to take the bronze medal in the men's cycling team pursuit. The commentator has just added: \"It's a very popular result.\"</p> <p>The Germans have clearly upset the BBC, Tom Hopkins noting: \"In the middle of the tedious debate over whether we'd get silver or bronze in the horse riding,\" yawn, but wait, \"Claire Balding noted that Britain, France and the US were appealing for points to be docked from the German girl and 'history teaches us that when those three nations take on the Germans, they usually win.' You could almost hear the cringing around the studio.\"</p> <p>Britain will have another medal in about ten minutes, but will it be gold or silver? The team pursuit cyclists are warming up now, and will set off in a couple of minutes. Australia beat GB in the world championships three months ago, but can they do it on the biggest stage? Paul Manning, Bradley Wiggins, Rob Hayles and Steve Cummings go for Britain, and Sir Steve Redgrave and Mary Peters are among the famous faces in the crowd.</p> <p> <strong>3.25pm:</strong> Nick Dempsey finished first in the ninth race of the men's sailing Mistral (windsurfing) today, and sixth in the tenth race. He lies fourth overall.</p> <p>Jo Davis has sent a quote to make one chuckle. \"How about Brendan Foster's whole 'it's not a real marathon' theme yesterday?\" she asks rhetorically, knowing it's a good'un. \"Surely an accusation which could be reasonably levelled against any other marathon in the world, but not this one.\" Too right. John Inverdale's presenting on Radio Five was almost as comic, claiming that the Japanese marathon girls run 840 miles a week. Eight hundred and forty miles a week! That would mean 120 miles a day, or almost five marathons a day. </p> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> The Beeb are currently showing the men's sprint cycling - you know the one, it's where the two cyclists tart around for a few laps before one of them decides he's had enough and goes for it. These particular races are just one lap, and are only taking 10 seconds. Of course, this is just the warm-up event (in other words, there's no Brits riding) and the big race is in 20 minutes, when GB take on Australia in the men's team pursuit.</p> <p>Victoria Pendleton has not qualified for the final in the woman's sprint, finishing ninth.</p> <p>Peter Morley, in St Petersburg, informs me that excessive commentary spreads further than just these isles. \"Russian TV commentators are noted for their paranoia (usually claims of biased judging in favour of the Yanks) and rabid nationalism, which usually means claiming anything and anyone with a vague connection to Russia as 'ours'. Particular highlights this time have been a commentator saying a boxer is 'ours - he was born in Kazakhstan then moved to Germany', and a gymnastics commentator saying 'The North - that's our Korea, let's say'.\" I suppose that's similar to the way we all claimed Greg Rusedski as \"ours\" when he was winning, but not now that he's useless we hardly hear about him.</p> <p> <strong>3.05pm:</strong> Britain's Tim Brabants has qualified fastest for Friday's final in the men's K1 1000m. He will look to add to medals won by Helen Reevs and Campbell Walsh last week.</p> <p>Dominic Jones has answered my plea for commentator gaffes, though he did his best to kill the anecdote before revealing the quote. \"I think the comment was made with regards to their poor showing in the womens team all around competition and there are worse stereotypes he could have referred to but I couldn't help nearly choking on my beer when one of the beeb's gymnastics commentators observed that the chinese team were 'looking a bit short'...tautology at its best.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, to update you on Syed's favourite Swede, Jan-Ove Waldner has lost to Wang Liqin of China in the table-tennis bronze medal play-off.</p> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> Carl hester has donned his top hat and tails once more, gracing the equestrian venue in the first round of the indivudal dresage competition. He finished ninth in the Grand Prix Special, moving through to the second stage.</p> <p>The American \"basketball \"Dream team\" have had no trouble beating their Angolan counterparts 89-53. LeBron James et al may be moody, but they sure now how to slam-dunk.</p> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong> Hello everyone, just received a message from my mate (whose name, curiously, is M Renshaw, the same name as one of the riders in the cycling points race which will be run tomorrow) saying that he is indeed \u00a3100 lighter in the wallet, but is still pleased for the \"wily Korean\" in the table-tennis. According to Beeb commentator Matthe Syed, he is \"a rock\", which is slightly less hyperbolic than his assertion last week that a Swedish victory in the men's quarter-final was \"the iconic moment of the Games\". Any other ludicrous comments from commentators would be appreciated. Nothing happening at the moment, but I'll investigate now and report back shortly with all the news and gossip.</p> <p><strong>2.30pm</strong> The BBC are showing us various classic Olympic moments, so we'll have more from Paula. \"It was an important thing. It was something I had worked for for so long - it was the one thing I was aiming for. A little bit of a bad day I could have got away with, but to have such a bad day...\" I'm off; here's Mike Adamson to guide you through the rest of the day.</p> <p><strong>2.25pm</strong> Ryu Seung Min of South Korea has taken the gold in the men's table tennis after beating China's Wang Hao 11-3 9-11 11-9 11-9 11-13 11-9 victory, and my colleague Mike Adamson's mate is \u00a3100 lighter as a consequence. \"[The radiant] Paula should run the 10,000,\" said Luke Satchell. \"She has a point to prove now (basically that she's not a total wuss).\"</p> <p><strong>2.22pm</strong> Paula Radcliffe says she hasn't decided whether to do the 10,000m.</p> <p><strong>2.20pm</strong> [The radiant] Paula Radcliffe has just spoken about yesterday's debacle. \"Middlesbrough didn't defend well enough,\" she said. Arf. \"Physically, I feel fine. My legs maybe felt they hit the ground harder than they did but physically I am okay. Mentally I am trying to pick up the pieces. It's really difficult - I am still waiting for the results of tests they did. I set off not too bad. I didn't feel conditions were excessively bothering me heatwise but after 15-20km I felt nothing in my legs. I felt I could regroup but in the end I was struggling to stay on the road and I felt numb.\" </p> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> Afternoon.</p> <p><strong>2.10pm</strong> Right, Mr Smyth will be back for the next update, so I'll leave you with news that Alexandre Despatie of Canada is romping (or should that be triple-piking) his way to victory in the 3m springboard. Please, contain yourselves.</p> <p><strong>2pm</strong> \"Do you think Paula should have done a Derek Redmond and hobbled her way into our hearts by completing the course?\" asks Andrew Doney. \"The Sports Personality of the Year award would have been a lock for her if she had - Freddie who?\" I'm sure we'd all enter the nation's hearts by experiencing a long, painful and generally unjust death Andrew, but when winning Big Brother is all it takes these days, why bother?</p> <p>Shameless attempt at getting British sailors onto top finishers list: race five in the open Tornado (multi-hill) sailing has finished, so why don't we take a look at, oh, I don't know, the first seven boats home? 1.

Tut tut.</p> <p>Korea's Ryu Seung-min has pulled off something of a coup to beat Wang Hao in the men's table tennis gold match. He won 11-3, 9-11, 11-9, 11-9, 11-13, 11-9, becoming the first Korean to win since Yoo Nam-Kyu in 1988.</p> <p>\"The repechage is a bit of a throwback to the Victorian organisation of sport isn't it?\", suggests Andrew Goldsby. \"'Well you chaps tried jolly hard why don't you have another go?'\" </p> <p><strong>1.40pm</strong> Apparently 10m people tuned in to watch Paula Radcliffe (who surely needs to get in touch with deed poll about that \"our\" prefix) last night. Unfortunately I wasn't among them, having got into a particularly addictive game of mahjong (so rock 'n' roll). Now, if that was an Olympic sport...</p> <p><strong>1.30pm</strong> Well, it looks like sailing is set to become the next big thing in Britain, what with our sailors doing so well out there. Chris Draper and Simon Hiscocks have just finished second in race 11 of the open 49er (that's double handed dinghy to the likes of us). Expect to see Jodie Marsh taking to the Thames any day now...</p> <p>\"What exactly is the difference between the repechage and a semi final?\" asks Maj Evill, possibly raising a pinkie to the corner of his mouth (but probably not). A repechage is a bit like the fastest losers element of track racing - people eliminated in the qualifying rounds compete to make it through to the quarterfinals, say.</p> <p><strong>1.20pm</strong> Brit watch: Iain Percy and Steve Mitchell came sixth in race five of the men's keelboat. Canadian's Ross Macdonald and Mike Wolfs came first.</p> <p>\"We've sorted out why Roger Black isn't on the telly during the Olympics (he's busy motivating people),\" says Nick Watson, \"but its been bothering me - why is Michael Johnson on the BBC, and not NBC, ABC, CNN or whatever US channel? Surely he must be in high demand?\" Have you seen him chatting to Sue? There's more animation in Eastenders' Ferreira family, for my money.</p> <p><strong>1.10pm</strong> Sorry for the delay, there's no excuse. To make up for it, I've dug out possibly the funniest quote of the games thus far. Greek boxer Elias Pavlidis made this sensational revelation in today's Greek daily Apogevmatini: \"Yes, I do take drugs, but my anabolics are classical music, piano.\" But wait, it gets better. \"If they tested me, I believe they would find in my blood the notes of Rachmaninov.\" Ah, you gotta love the Greeks.</p> <p><strong>12.55pm all right it's 12.57pm</strong> We've started on the windsurfing now, so we might as well persevere: the women's event now. Jian Yin of China is out in front after nine races, Natasha Sturges of Team GB is in 11th. The Chinese are having a storming games, aren't they? I've only had emails from \"important people\" offering me investment opportunities so far by the way. Anyone want to get in touch while I line my bank account with the lost funds of various African nations?</p> <p><strong>12.45pm</strong> We'll take a breather from the waxed chests of the diving to bring you... men's windsurfing, and Britain's Nick Dempsey won the ninth race and is now fourth overall, behind Gal Fridman, Ricardo Santos and Nikolaos Kaklamanakis.</p> <p>Dean Macey's standing seventh so far in the decathlon, by the way, with 2647 points from three events. </p> <p>And anyone who's confused over Britain's gold medals (not just how on earth we got them but how many we've got), I've been semi-reliably informed that we do have six, but only five have actually been awarded. Possibly. We've got six, anyway.</p> <p><strong>12.35pm</strong> In the absence of any more interesting results to bring you, we'll stick with the diving, men's 3m springboard to be uncharacteristically precise. Some lovely diving in the third round has seen the lead changes hands with every other competitor, but it is with China's Peng Bo at the moment.</p> <p><strong>12.25pm</strong> Hello one and all, trust you're enjoying a pleasant afternoon so on and etc. Leslie Law is currently seventh in the showjumping business, with Pippa Funnell 11th and Jeanette Brakewell 17th, in case you wish to be so informed. There's some men's diving going on at the moment, all of which looks incredibly graceful and athletic, none of which I'm going to pretend I can describe in the technical terms, but it's being led by the Russian after two rounds.</p> <p><strong>12.10</strong> Dean Macey is currently third in the shot put heat with that 15.73m. \"The human drama that was Gareth Henderson's stag in Jersey this weekend easily eclipsed anything your Pinsents and Radcliffes managed,\" begins Andre Douglas. \"Our epic beach cricket match attracted easily 7 spectators and one dear girl risked her life retrieving a ball for us from the middle of the surging Jersey motor traffic. Our thanks to her and all the other beautiful island girls who will live long in the memory. But curses to the hidden mollusc which might have ended my beach rugby career...\" That's it from me; I'm off to get some lunch. Join Georgina Turner for more from, well, right now.</p> <p><strong>12.05</strong> \"Please explain,\" says Robert Hisnay. \"I don't understand how come there was no minute-by-minute live of the England-Ukraine friendly but you can find time to cover the Olympics.\" I couldn't be certain, Robert, but I think it's to do with one being a meaningless friendly and the other being the biggest sporting event of the year. </p> <p><strong>12.00</strong> In the hockey, Spain hammered Egypt 3-0, and New Zealand beat South Africa 4-1.\"I'm so bored of the Olympics now,\" says Jonathan Keith. \"At least until Katie Allenby competes in the women's pentathlon. So meanwhile, who's the biggest-selling-out band ever? My vote could possibly go to the Dandy Warhols, for taking the Barclays and Vodaphone advertising shillings, except for the fact that their entire <em>raison d'etre</em> has been buckets of cash and never mind where it comes from.\" </p> <p><strong>11.50</strong> Strike two for Macey, but he only manages 15.17m this time. Like a man who's wolfed down an undercooked chicken that's about to give him food poisoning even though he doesn't know it yet, he rushed that a bit. Bah!</p> <p><strong>11.45</strong> The decathlon shot put is underway, and Dean Macey begins with 15.73m - only 4cm off his personal best.</p> <p><strong>11.30</strong> \"Is it my telly or does Waldner look a bit like perennial EastEnders loser Ian Beale?\" says James Peterson. Good spot, and like Beale he is indeed a loser: Liqin has won 4-1. \"Maybe he wasn't complaining about the air conditioning but simply concerned that the deep fat fryers in the snack stall outside were a bit hot?\"</p> <p><strong>11.25</strong> Even Waldner's old-man cropped centre-parting can't save him now, surely. \"You have a history of just missing out on medals in the big event,\" says Andrew Goldsby. Do I? \"So you decide to dedicate 4 years of your life to one event to correct that one failing in your sporting career. However after 23 miles of searing heat, hills and running you know you've no chance of that one thing you worked so hard for. For crying out loud is it any wonder she fell apart? Not very British I grant you but very, very human and I'd rather see that.\"</p> <p><strong>11.20</strong> Liqin takes the third game 11-8, and the fourth 11-7. Sean Ingle to my right is getting <em>very</em> excited. \"If Katy Turner's asking about my email sent on Friday where Americans came fourth 20% of the time in the swimming and diving, it was the percentage of fourths who were American,\" says Chris Powell. \"I would have worked it out for the whole Olympics but I got really bored.\" Surely not, etc. \"Regarding the Prodigy album too, is it perhaps not only that it doesn't sound as young, fresh 'n' new, but also that you (like myself) are no longer as young, fresh 'n' new?\" </p> <p> <strong>11.15</strong> Waldner is getting battered now: he's 7-2 down in the third game, and whinging about the air conditioning. \"I know you're a Radiohead fan,\" says Ian Johnston, \"but the pure horror of listening to Kid A for the first time means that no first listen of a new album will ever be as bad again.\" You clearly haven't heard John Squire's first album, Ian.</p> <p><strong>11.10</strong> In the table tennis, Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner has taken the first game of his bronze-medal shoot-out, 12-10, against Liqin Wang. Ah, now it's 1-1, after Liqin took the second game 11-3.</p> <p><strong>11.05</strong> \"As a percentage of medals to athletes attending, do you know who is the most successful nation in Olympic history?\" asks Christian Nistri. What do you think I am, Christian, some speccy, maths-loving retentive nerd, eh? Exactly: I'll have the answer to you asap.</p> <p><strong>11.00</strong> \"With regard to the percentage of fourth places, what exactly was calculated?\" asks Katy Turner. \"The percentage of fourths who were American or the percentage of Americans competing who finished fourth. It's important. Possibly.\" Katy, I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.</p> <p><strong>10.50</strong> Meanwhile, anyone got any thoughts on the new Prodigy album? I expected an absolute shocker after reading various reviews, but the first and last songs are absolute stormers, and the stuff in the middle is slowly growing, too. Mind you, it doesn't sound as young, fresh 'n' new as the other Prodigy albums. </p> <p><strong>Brief football update in the absence of any Olympic news</strong> Paul Sturrock has left Southampton by 'mutual consent'. Yeah, right.</p> <p><strong>The great Paula debate</strong> \"Everybody loves a crying loser so are the bets off for BBC 'Sports Personality of the Year' award?\" fumes Ian Johnston. Sorry Freddie but you can't laugh and joke while you beat the Windies and expect to be loved like [the radiant] Boo Hoo Radcliffe.\" You and Jo Manning would get along well.</p> <p><strong>1040</strong> Decathlon standings after the 100m and long jump.<br> 1 Bryan Clay (USA) 2039pts<br> 2 Dmitriy Karpov (Kaz) 1987pts <br> 3 Chiel Warners (Ned) 1942pts <br> 4 Roman Sebrle (Cze) 1914pts <br> 5 Jaakko Ojaniemi (Fin) 1868pts <br> 6 Claston Bernard (Jam) 1861pts <br> 7 Nikolay Averyanov (Rus) 1859pts <br> 8 Erki Nool (Est) 1848pts <br> 9 Dean Macey (Gbr) 1812pts <br>10 Tom Pappas (USA) 1811pts.</p> <p><strong>What <em>did</em> happen to Roger Black</strong> \"I can confirm that Roger Black is now pursuing a potentially lucrative career in motivational speaking with Kris Akabusi,\" says James Wilson. \"He came and did a talk designed to give everyone at our firm a boost. I'm not sure if anyone asked him how he motivated himself to go and get soundly beaten by Michael Johnson or how he feels about Johnson nabbing his spot at the BBC, too...\"</p> <p><strong>10.30</strong> Not much happening at the moment as we wait for the decathlon shot put. \"Did anyone see the table tennis quarter final between Jan Ove Waldner and Timo Boll?\" asks Frances Green. \"The overexcited commentator described it as the 'iconic moment of the Olympic games' and likened it to the Muhammad Ali / George Foreman 'Rumble in the Jungle'. Not sure how fitting that was....\" Not very, I'd wager.</p> <p><strong>10.25</strong> Dean Macey's 7.47m put him sixth in his long jump group. \"This weekend I was overdosing on culture, with a trip to Notre Dame, the Louvre and the Orsay...\" says Tame Alien. What sort of a name do you call that?</p> <p><strong>10.15</strong> \"It's interesting to reflect the mentality behind the torrent of abuse directed towards [the radiant] Paula,\" says David Clayton. \"These know-nothings didn't seem to see the Japanese athlete spewing up at the roadside after only 10 miles or the heat-hardened Kenyan failing to pull back 12 secs on the Japanese athlete who was clearly rocking over the last miles.\"</p> <p><strong>10.05</strong> The decathlon (men's) shot put heats were scheduled for 10.20, but it should be nearer 11 by the time they get started now. \"I was on a friend's hen do in Brighton,\" says Louise Wright. \"If anyone else was there, we were the ones with shiny red devil horns and an air of over-exuberance. Amazingly, nobody cried, nobody was sick, and nobody got into a fight.\"</p> <p><strong>The coldest woman in Cardiff writes...</strong> \"Anyone else feel very little sympathy for [the radiant] Radders?\" asks Jo Manning. \"Maybe if she'd bothered finishing the race instead of bawling on a pavement I'd have felt differently...\"</p> <p><strong>10.00</strong> Here's Kevin McCann: \"Before reading or acting on this e-mail, or opening any attachment, please read Derby City Council's disclaimer and confidentiality statement at the end of this e-mail.\" Eh? Oh. \"Never mind [the radiant] Paula, what has happened to Roger Black? Does anybody know where he is and why he is not being used by the BBC?\"</p> <p><strong>9.55</strong> To reiterate, Dean Macey jumped 7.47m before passing on his last two jumps, though where that puts him in the grand scheme of things I've no idea as yet, because the long jump is running 40 minutes late. Unlike my train from Clapton this morning, which was bang on time! Tanni Grey Thompson, meanwhile, is on TV and she's just used the word 'insipid'. You don't get words like that from Wayne Rooney, do you? Although you do get words like 'massage' and 'parlours', if today's tabloids are anything to go by.</p> <p><strong>9.54</strong> The emails, like goals in a spectacularly-depressing-yet-I-suppose-quite-worthy Arsenal comeback, are flying in now. \"I ran a 5k race on Saturday, in aid of the Limbless Association,\" says Grace Pickering. \"Bekele only runs 2.15 times faster than me, which I think is quite an achievement on my part.\" Absolutely; and I ran the 100m in 49.94 yesterday, which puts me within 40 seconds of being Olympic champion.</p> <p><strong>9.51</strong> I hope I can run like Merlene Ottey at the age of 44 - she's just finished third in her 200m heat. A time of 22.72 at the age of 44! Like my (former) friend's assertion that he'd rather listen to Starship than Radiohead, that's just wrong.</p> <p><strong>9.45</strong> A Greek solider guardian an Olympic facility was shot dead this morning, apparently during a game of Russian roulette.</p> <p><strong>Pathetic plea for emails</strong> Come on.

  "<p>Looking out across the main plaza of the Santander Group's new, nearly finished headquarters on the outskirts of Madrid, it would be easy to forget you are still in Spain. The parched yellow fields in the background and the shallow rectangular pools and freshly planted cypress trees that break up the patio carry echoes of the country's Moorish past. </p> <p>But everything else says this is a super modern financial centre. You could be in Asia or South America or, most tellingly, the United States. </p> <p>And that, of course, is the point. Santander City, as it is known, is a clear statement of the bank's ambitions, and those ambitions are inspired by America. </p> <p>Emilio Botin, Santander's emblematic chairman, has maintained a healthy relationship with the US bank Wachovia ever since he sold it his stake in First Fidelity in 1995. A couple of years later he visited the bank's new campus headquarters at Charlotte, North Carolina, and it gave him an idea. </p> <p>Now, six angular buildings of grey stone, gun metal and dark glass spread out across the plain. Bamboo sprouts up from below, escalators dip beneath the pavement. At the heart of it sits the presidential building, a space-age ark, from where Botin looks out over the city. </p> <p>When the project was conceived Santander's transforming deals still lay ahead. But already the process of building through acquisition had left management scattered across the centre of Madrid. Botin knew that his ambitions would only make the problem worse. </p> <p>Santander City brings all the main people together in one place for the first time. It gives the bank a centre and a sense of identity. </p> <p><strong> American model</strong><br> </p> <p> The 150 hectare site is Spain's biggest ever real estate project. It has cost \u20ac480m (\u00a3325m). And by the end of the year, 6,000 Santander employees will be working there full time. </p> <p>If you start from the American premise that corporate efficiency is paramount, then you can't fault the project. Not only does it look great, it is cost effective and organisationally efficient. </p> <p>The sale of the city centre properties the bank owned has covered the entire cost and it will save a further \u20ac21m a year in rent. Having all the important people based in the same place saves an enormous number of man hours which would otherwise be spent in taxis running up and down the Castellana, Madrid's main boulevard. </p> <p>Botin has predicted a 30% increase in worker productivity. \"Bringing together formerly fragmented services leads to a significant saving in management and maintenance,\" he said at the project's official launch. </p> <p>\"Second, improving the possibilities of interaction between staff means a greater flow of ideas and knowledge.\" </p> <p>If, however, you take the European view that there are some abstract benefits in having your staff wander out into the city to drink coffee and shop and meet their friends from time to time, then Santander City has considerable drawbacks. </p> <p>The problem is, Botin's vision may be American, but most of his staff are European. </p> <p>So he has set out to persuade them. Santander City has free restaurants with free beer. It has a free cr\u00e8che. There are 17 free bus services running to different parts of Madrid and there are heavily subsidised mortgages for staff to buy homes in the town of Boadilla just down the hill. </p> <p><strong> Prison</strong><br> </p> <p> It is a major charm offensive. But the Spanish love to grumble, even those who work for the country's biggest bank. </p> <p>\"Spaniards don't go to bars for beer,\" says a building contractor from Boadilla who worked on the project. \"Maybe the British wouldn't understand, but we go for the people. In the Santander complex they are surrounded by the same people that they work with all day. It's just not the same. It feels like a prison. I wouldn't work there, and my friends who do aren't very sure.\" </p> <p>The prison comparison does tend to come up. It could be the double security fence plus cameras and dogs. Or the fact that the layout owes a debt to 18th century theories of discipline. Those floor-to-ceiling windows will make the traditional siesta seem uncomfortably exposed (the chairman's office has blinds). </p> <p>But few prisons look quite so stylish. And none has its own golf course. </p> <p>\"I think the whole deal is extremely generous,\" says one former Santander banker based in the Boadilla area. </p> <p>\"I don't have much patience for my friends at Santander when they complain about the move. They're being completely blind.\" </p> <p>He points out that many of the big corporations have moved out of the city in recent years and none have done as much for the staff as Santander. </p> <p>Other reports suggest that staff are already coming round to the idea. As they pass through the border controls of the futuristic city each morning on their way to the office, they may reflect: Santander has never been a place for traditionalists anyway.</p>",
  "<p>Hope of an Olympic Gold for the British athletics team may be fading fast, but a new study of endurance in mice suggests we may soon understand how to build a better athlete - one who can run twice the distance of competitors.</p> <p>Professor Ronald Evans, of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California, has discovered a way of changing the muscle type of mice, altering the way they consume energy and improving their endurance and speed. </p> <p>Running, like any form of exercise, consumes large volumes of a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which generates fuel for muscle cells, powering contractions and sustaining on going exercise. The way the ATP molecule is produced depends on a number of factors including speed, duration of exercise, type of activity and the type of muscle fibre involved. Animals contain two types of skeletal muscle fibre - type I, or slow twitch and type II, fast twitch. Slow twitch fibres are aerobic and need oxygen to generate the large volumes of ATP required for long distance running. Endurance athletes like Paula Radcliffe have up to 90% slow twitch muscle fibres. </p> <p>Fast twitch fibres, on the other hand, are anaerobic, and produce ATP very quickly by burning glucose in the muscle cells. This produces the rapid and powerful contractions needed for sprinting; short distance runners, like 100m Olympic gold medallist Justin Gatlin, have up to 80% fast twitch muscle fibres.</p> <p>Endurance training has been shown to change the type of muscle fibre in the body to the more efficient slow twitch, thereby improving performance. Professor Evans believes a protein called PPAR-delta, which regulates the way fat is burnt in the body, might control this change.</p> <p>In a paper published today in the Journal PLoS Biology, the professor and his team explained how they genetically engineered mice to produce higher levels of PPAR-delta in their muscle cells. They found that the engineered mice could run twice the distance of - and for nearly an hour longer than - their normal siblings.</p> <p>Converting muscle fibre to the slow twitch variety needed for endurance sport could not only improve performance, but may also protect against obesity.</p> <p>The average person watching the Olympics on TV has an equal proportion of both fast and slow twitch fibres, but in severely obese patients the fast twitch fibres are much more common. Finding a means of converting these fast fibres into the more efficient slow twitch fibres could improve a patient's metabolic rate, even without exercise.</p>",
  "The Conservatives today mooted repealing the Human Rights Act as part of its manifesto for the next general election. <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, announced he is to form a commission to look at \"reform, replacement or repeal\" of the legislation - which was seen as one of Labour's landmark achievements on coming to office.</p> <p>The Tory commission - its members have yet to be announced - will report back in time for the general election, with Mr Davis pledging to make its conclusions a \"high priority\" for an incoming Conservative government.</p> <p>Any move to amend, or even end, the rights conferred under the act, which was brought in four years ago to implement the European convention on human rights (ECHR), is certain to prove controversial.</p> <p>But Mr Davis insisted there were now \"too many spurious rights\" as a result of the \"unintended consequences\" of the act.</p> <p>Conservative-produced statistics claim that there has been a 20-fold increase in cases in which the convention has now been considered - and a 70% increase in cases in which it has affected the outcome.</p> <p>In a Westminster press conference, Mr Davis said that the act - which was passed in 1998 and came into force in 2000 - has allowed convicted killers access to hardcore pornography in prison, and given travellers the right to set up homes in country villages.</p> <p>He also said that the number of prisoners in Scotland serving a life sentence who were awarded parole had leapt by 40% as a result of the act.</p> <p>\"Some, if not all, of these consequences would be disapproved of by most UK citizens,\" he said.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary said he was in favour of \"real human rights\", and had opposed David Blunkett's attempts in parliament to curb trial by jury.</p> <p>A chair of the new commission has already been appointed, Mr Davis revealed, although he refused to say who it was or who its members would be until October - probably in time for the Tory party conference in Bournemouth.</p> <p>Mr Davis first spelled out plans for reform of the Human Rights Act in an article for the Spectator last week. </p> <p>Mr Davis said he wanted to cut back the \"cancer of litigation\" caused by the act. \"Once we had inherited English liberties; now we have incorporated European rights,\" he wrote. </p> <p>\"The English idea - evolved through the Magna Carta (1215), the Petition of Right (1628) and the Bill of Rights (1689) - was of freedom held back from the state. </p> <p>\"The idea - invented by the Code Napoleon - is of bounties handed out by the state. </p> <p>\"Once, the law limited the state and enlarged the sphere in which the citizen could be free; now, it imposes obligations on the state and limits the freedom of the citizen.\" </p> <p>In effect, by incorporating the ECHR into British law, the Tories argue that the Labour government streamlined the procedure by which applicants had to go to Europe to have their cases adjudicated upon. </p> <p>Mr Davis admitted it would be \"highly complex\" to redraw the law, but said that the Tories were not considering withdrawing from the ECHR itself.</p> <p>Human rights lawyer Geoffrey Bindman QC rejected the idea that the Human Rights Act, which enshrined the European convention into British law, was based on continental legal principles. </p> <p> \"That convention very much expresses principles of English law going back centuries, and the drafting of the convention was largely done by British lawyers led by a former Conservative lord chancellor,\" he told the BBC's World At One programme. \"It is simply not true that we have incorporated some European document.\" </p> <p>He added that only a very small number of cases had been brought to court under the act. \"In fact, because of the reduction in the availability of legal aid by the present government, it is extremely difficult for anybody to mount a human rights claim,\" he said.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said: \"The increase in spurious compensation claims is bad news, but the Human Rights Act is not the cause. The act contains principles which most of us agree are a good thing, like the right to life, to a fair trial, and to freedom of speech. </p> <p>Meanwhile the president of the Law Society, Edward Nally, said: \"A recent government study found the compensation culture is an urban myth fuelled by misleading media coverage. </p> <p>\"It is only right that genuine claimants whose lives have been ruined in that way should receive compensation. It would be nonsensical to exclude the public services from that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Free driving lessons, discounts on books and CDs, the gimmicks in place to lure in young business to the banks are endless. </p> <p>If you are old enough to come over all misty-eyed when you remember the NatWest piggy banks, now collectors' items, then there's a strong chance you still hold an account with the bank that gave them to you. A symptom of the inertia that keeps consumers from looking for a better deal, perhaps, and, of course, a source of delight to the banks. </p> <p>It is in their interest to bring in customers at a tender age, and to keep them there until they start making them serious money by taking out mortgages and credit cards and buying insurance. And it's in everyone else's interest to see through the freebies used to lure children and young people in. </p> <p><strong>First accounts</strong></p> <p>The accounts for younger children are essentially savings accounts, with little need for extras, and so the first thing parents are likely to look at is the interest rate. As such, freebies play second fiddle, and interest rates for first savings accounts are fairly competitive, hovering around the 4% mark. That way children are brought into the fold nice and early.</p> <p>HSBC's Young Savers Account pays 4%, while the NatWest interest rate is tiered, starting at 4.07% and increasing depending on the balance of the account. Junior Barclays Plus is similar - it starts at 3.65%, then increases according to the amount saved, although you have to have over \u00a310,000 to go into the next tier. </p> <p><strong>11 to 16-year-olds</strong> </p> <p>At secondary school-age, all the major banks offer current accounts with telephone or internet banking and cashcards, trading up to Solo or Electron debit cards at 16 (with the exception of Barclays, which offers a debit card at 15, subject to parental permission). And the gimmicks, in some cases, get flashy. </p> <p>HSBC's Live Cash account comes with a free clip-on radio or, from September, an electronic touch screen organiser. It also offers a reasonable rate of interest, at 4%.</p> <p>Abbey, which currently offers a lower interest rate of 2.53%, is unusual in offering no specific gift for 11 to16-year-olds. Instead, says a spokesperson: \"Our philosophy is based around giving young people the means to learn about managing their money, and advice to support them.\" </p> <p><strong>School leavers</strong></p> <p>You might be able to leave school, smoke, and even get married, but the average 16-year-old is not likely to be in the habit of doing the research to find the best financial deals. According to Alliance &amp; Leicester, 72% of 16-24-year-olds have not shopped around for their bank account. </p> <p>This is, of course, a fact not lost on the account providers according to Philippa Gee, investments director at financial advisor Torquil Clark. \"You need look no further than the poor deals offered by the major banks as they simply don't need to price themselves into the market - they get business whatever they offer,\" she says.</p> <p>However, even if the offer is similar, some banks are now trying to differentiate their products by marketing them to those who are leaving school at 16. Alliance &amp; Leicester is pitching for the business of the 60% of those who choose not to go to university with its Young Worker current account. </p> <p>Open to those between 16 and 21 who can pay at least \u00a3100 into their account every month, it offers the standard services of debit cards and free internet and telephone banking but also, to those over 18, a guaranteed \"emergency fund\" of at least \u00a350 which is interest free for six months, \u00a33 per month for an authorised overdraft and a pre-approved credit card. However, its standard interest rate is poor, at 0.25%. The linked savings account offers a more competitive 4.5%.</p> <p>HSBC, meanwhile, offers 16-17-year-olds a Right Track into Study and Right Track into Work package, with a free driving lesson and discounted subsequent lessons. </p> <p>HSBC's head of youth accounts Josie Clapham says this is about talking to the individual. \"If you look at a 16-year-old who's working versus a 16-year-old in education, they have very different lifestyles and needs,\" she says. </p> <p>In fact, the two accounts are virtually the same, but for the name. They both offer a chequebook, direct debit facility, debit card and access to the bank's mini cash Isa, but beyond the free driving lessons lies a low rate of interest of just 1%. </p> <p>There are plenty of other gifts and gimmicks to choose from, like the 15% discount at Waterstone's and HMV for Barclays' 16-19-year-old Young Person's Account customers, or the mobile top-up vouchers for NatWest's 11-18 Card Plus account holders. But Barclays only pays 1% interest on balances, while NatWest pays 3.4%. </p> <p>Even if with a young person's account that pays a good rate of interest and offers everything you want, it's important to find out what will happen the account holder reaches the age limit. With HSBC's Right Track to Work account, the bank will write to the account holder two months before their 18th birthday to let them know they will be moving on to its account for 18 to 21-year-olds. This is essentially the bank's normal, adult current account, with all its standard features and a few incentives thrown in, and pays a pretty miserable rate of interest of just 0.1%.</p> <p>It's essential to be aware of what's behind the gimmicks when choosing an account. And, when it comes to moving up an age bracket, it's just as important not to be shuffled along into an account with a low rate of interest. Check whether the new account offers you the best deal for your needs, and if it doesn't, take your business elsewhere, rather than sitting back and demonstrating that inertia banks rely on.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC's Today programme, still dealing with the aftermath of the Hutton report, is in the dock again after being criticised by watchdogs for broadcasting one-sided allegations about Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Ofcom found the BBC's report failed to present the response of the Saudi government to allegations made about its arms procurement policy.</p> <p>The adjudication is embarrassing for the Today editor, Kevin Marsh, who has been trying to keep a clean slate in the wake of the devastating Hutton report and particularly because it comes just months after BBC governors found fault with the programme for a similar offence.</p> <p>Ofcom investigated the programme, which aired in November 2003, following a complaint from the Saudi ambassador, Turki al Faisal.</p> <p>Today had broadcast allegations from a former employee of a company that acquired visas for Saudi subjects in relation to a defence contract in 1985.</p> <p>The man made allegations concerning the level of hospitality provided to Saudi officials, further claiming that sweeteners were required in order to do business with officials and diplomats from the kingdom.</p> <p>The Saudi government complained about the programme through its embassy in London, saying the allegations were untrue and that the BBC had not included any of the right to reply statement provided by the embassy. </p> <p>Ofcom said the seriousness of the allegations warranted a right to reply and that the BBC had been amiss not to run any of the Saudi government's defending statement.</p> <p>\"Ofcom was not in a position to say whether the allegations were correct or not.

  "<p>Greek medical chiefs have discovered anabolic steroids at a warehouse used by the coach of disgraced sprinters Kostas Kederis and Ekaterina Thanou, Greece's National Organisation of Medicines said today.</p> <p>A prosecutor and two inspectors working for the agency searched the offices and warehouses of coach Christos Tzekos last Friday and found small amounts of the supplements, which they removed from the building.</p> <p>\"The supplements included materials that do not have a distribution license,\" read a statement from the agency, which also said that more than 1,000 'units' of food supplements contained the stimulant ephedrine as their main ingredient.</p> <p>The agency, which is known as EOF, also revealed that \"small quantities of medicines that contained anabolic steroids\" were found in the warehouse.</p> <p>EOF vowed to \"take all the necessary actions that are foreseen by the law\" and added that \"the inspections would continue and expand in all directions.\"</p> <p>The search of Tzekos' premises follows the withdrawal of Kederis - the Olympic champion at 200m - and Thanou, who won silver in the 100m in Sydney four years ago, from the Olympics after the pair missed a dope test in the Olympic Village on August 12.</p> <p>The pair were subsequently admitted to hospital after a reported motorcycling accident, and they withdrew from the Games last Wednesday.</p> <p>Both athletes maintain their innocence.</p>",
  "Explosions and gunfire shook Najaf again today as US forces continued to battle militants sheltering in one of Shia Islam's holiest shrines. <p>Militia members loyal to the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr remain in control of the Imam Ali mosque despite protracted negotiations over a peaceful handover of the shrine to religious authorities. </p> <p>Damage to intricate tiling on one of the shrine's outer walls was visible this morning after the latest fighting. At least three people were killed and 18 injured overnight, according to Tawfiq Mohammed of Najaf general hospital.</p> <p>For more than an hour today militants fired mortars at US troops, who responded with artillery, residents said; late yesterday US warplanes and helicopters attacked positions in Najaf's old city for the second night, according to witnesses. </p> <p>The US military said it had fired on sites from where militants were shooting, south of the shrine, and had not hit the compound wall.</p> <p>The clashes in Najaf yesterday appeared more intense than those of recent days as US forces sealed off the old city. </p> <p>The fighting around the mosque had eased by mid-morning and US tanks had pulled back from positions as close to the compound as 800 metres, Reuters reported. </p> <p>Officials from the Iraqi interim government said they intended to resolve the crisis without raiding the shrine. </p> <p>\"The government will leave no stone unturned to reach a peaceful settlement,\" the deputy Iraqi national security adviser, Mouaffaq al-Rubaie, told the Associated Press. </p> <p>\"It has no intention or interest in killing more people or having even the most trivial damage to the shrine. We have a vested interest in a peaceful settlement.\" </p> <p>Senior government officials last week said an Iraqi force was preparing to raid the shrine within hours to break the Mahdi army's grip on Najaf, but Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, quickly stepped back from that threat. </p> <p>Such an operation would anger Shia across the country, possibly turning them against the new government as it tries to gain legitimacy and tackle the 16-month-old insurgency. </p> <p>The potential for Shia anger was made all the more apparent today when the Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami, said Iraq's interim government risked losing popular support because of its backing for military operations in Najaf. </p> <p>Both US and Iraqi officials have accused Iran, an old enemy of Iraq, of stirring up tensions among Iraq's Shia community. </p> <p>Mr Khatami told reporters the fighting was unjustified since Mr Sadr's militia had shown it was willing to reach a negotiated settlement. </p> <p>\"It seems there is a desire to crack down on Najaf and scare all Iraqis,\" the official IRNA news agency quoted Mr Khatami as saying.</p> <p>\"It was Falluja yesterday; today it is Najaf, and if the trend continues it will spread to all Iraqis.\" </p> <p>Some Iranian politicians have said Iran should actively support Mr Sadr in his fight against the US and its allies. Mr Khatami, however, was quick to point out that Iran did not support Mr Sadr.</p> <p>\"We have never officially supported any particular group in Iraq. We want peace and stability to prevail in Iraq. The Islamic Republic of Iran has not carried out any provocative interference in Iraq,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Sadr proved useful to one American, however: Micah Garen, a journalist from New York, was freed on Sunday after the cleric made an appeal to his kidnappers.</p> <p>Militants had threatened Mr Garen and his Iraqi translator, Amir Doushi, with death if US forces did not pull back from Najaf. </p> <p>In a brief interview with the Arab TV news channel al-Jazeera after his release, Mr Garen thanked Mr Sadr's representatives for their work.</p>",
  "<p>On a steamy Saturday afternoon last weekend, 120 or so people filed into the Quad Cinema in New York's West Village to do something they had probably never done before: watch Fox News. </p> <p>Or rather, they were watching a documentary about Fox News: an angry evisceration of America's rabidly rightwing 24-hour news channel. The gasps from the liberal audience were frequently audible. Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism is a polemic in the same vein as Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. The film rounds on Fox for hiding behind objectivity; although the channel's twin mottos are \"We report, you decide\" and \"Fair and balanced\" it hammers home the point that Fox is neither. Clips show anchors ridiculing Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry for looking French (an incalculable insult in the mind of a conservative), counting down the days \"until president Bush is re-elected\" and brutalising liberal guests. Another anchor chirps that \"North Korea loves John Kerry\". </p> <p>\"We weren't necessarily, as it was told to us, a newsgathering organisation, so much as we were a proponent of a point of view,\" says John Du Pre, a former Fox correspondent, in the film. </p> <p>In one sequence that seems like a bad joke, the veteran anchor Brit Hume stands in front of two maps side by side, one of Iraq, one of California. As he updates on the American dead in the Iraqi conflict, he deadpans that there is more chance of being shot in Burbank than Baghdad. The implication seemed to be that we should stop our liberal handwringing. </p> <p>The film, the work of Hollywood producer/director Robert Greenwald, was made on a shoestring budget of $300,000, largely funded by campaigning leftwing organisations, and began life as a so-called \"guerrilla\" DVD sold online. One of the organisations, <a href=\"http://www.Moveon.org\">Moveon.org</a>, screened the film at around 3,500 \"house parties\" across the nation. It quickly topped Amazon.com's bestsellers list. In the past few weeks the film has won theatrical release in a handful of American cities and it could now be picked up nationwide. </p> <p>Outfoxed is one of a new breed of documentaries enjoying unprecedented success in American cinemas. The most successful of the lot, Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore's biting but meandering assault on the Bush administration, has made more than $100m at the US box office alone. </p> <p>Others include Control Room, a portrait of the Arabic network al-Jazeera; The Corporation, an examination of corporate America; Super Size Me, a wry take on the ill effects of McCulture that opens soon in Britain, and Hunting the President, a trot through the hounding of former president Bill Clinton. </p> <p>The phenomenon could simply be a hunger for polemic in politically charged times. Outfoxed, while ridiculing the bias of Fox News, certainly makes no pretence at fair play itself, giving the channel no right of reply and indulging in some suspect editing to make its points. </p> <p>The success of the films, though, could also be explained by a different sentiment - a growing sense that Americans have been failed by the mainstream media, particularly since the Iraq war, and have an urge to seek out information elsewhere. It is probably no coincidence that in each case the underlying villain is the mainstream American media. Outfoxed is just the most stunning and unapologetic exemplar. </p> <p>It also seems unlikely to be a coincidence that the tub-thumping documentary is succeeding at a time when the nation's most well-respected newspapers and some of the best-known TV anchors are admitting that they failed to ask the tough questions in the run-up to war in Iraq. </p> <p>The mainstream media's self-doubt was most recently evident in the Washington Post, which on August 12 ran a critical self-examination of its coverage in the months leading into the war and beyond. Stories questioning the rationale for war were buried at the back of the paper, while government proclamations regularly found their place on the front page. The piece concluded that, with hindsight, coverage had \"looked strikingly one-sided at times\". </p> <p>In May, the New York Times delivered an even harsher assessment of its own performance. Some stories, the newspaper ombudsman Daniel Okrent said, \"pushed Pentagon assertions so aggressively you could almost sense epaulets on the shoulders of editors\". </p> <p>The Post article ended with a question: \"Whether a tougher approach by The Post and other news organisations would have slowed the rush to war is, at best, a matter of conjecture.\" The comment drew angry responses from readers. \"Clearly, this is untrue,\" wrote one. \"If we believe that a properly informed citizenry is integral to a functional democracy, we should either recognise the media's role in allowing the war to happen or accept that we don't have a functioning democracy.\" And Christiane Amanpour of CNN at the end of last year aired her belief that the press had been \"muzzled\" by the government. </p> <p>The sense that Americans have lost some trust in mainstream US media is borne out elsewhere. Americans dubious of the cheerleading at home have been scrambling for overseas news coverage ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Almost 45% of the 9.6 million users accessing the Guardian's website originate in the US. </p> <p>Conspiracy theories have abounded not just about the administration but also about the media's complicity. Control Room touches on the well-rehearsed theory that the Pentagon press office staged the iconic toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. </p> <p>The thirst for \"truth\" also seems evident in the sheer volume of books clogging the bestsellers lists that promise to reveal the facts about the decisions that led to the Iraq war and the Bush administration. They have included the former intelligence chief Richard Clarke's Against All Enemies and Ron Suskind's The Price of Loyalty, based on the recollections of the former treasury chief Paul O'Neill. </p> <p>Of concern to journalists is that an unchecked mass of information, often with a clear agenda, is being embraced as fact. During the recent preview of autumn programming on ABC, the TV news anchor George Stephanopoulos expressed some concern at the growth of films like Fahrenheit 9/11 and the reasons for their popularity. </p> <p>He said he had seen the film with a group of undecided voters. \"What was most striking to me is when I asked them: 'Why did you go to see it?' and they said: 'Because we wanted to get the facts',\" he told reporters. \"At least a few of them had the sense that if it's coming from the government, if it's coming from the established media, they must not be telling us something, and we have to go to this alternative venue to get the facts.\" </p> <p>Even Hollywood directors are taking note. A recent article in the Los Angeles Times pointed to the re-emergence of politically charged films including The Manchurian Candidate, in which a vice presidential candidate is in the sway of a Halliburton-style corporation. \"The free press hasn't been on the job,\" the director Jonathan Demme told the paper. \"Maybe people are turning to all these films and documentaries for information, as if they're an unconscious effort to fill a void.\" </p> <p>The grasp for information could, though, simply be another example of the yawning chasm that divides America: the culture wars between the metropolitan values of the coasts and the conservative values of the vast swathes in between, a clash more in evidence now than ever before. </p> <p>Most of the bestselling books are anti-Bush and most of the documentaries now packing them in at the cinemas notably appeal to liberal sensibilities. Al Franken's recent book Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them attempts to explode the myth of liberal control of the media. The appetite for leftwing treatises on page or screen suggests he is right. </p> <p>While half of America is looking elsewhere for information, the other half is quietly content. Fox News - because of and not in spite of the flaws exposed in Outfoxed - remains the most popular news channel in the US.</p>",
  "<p>Mark Twain was supposed to have said: \"Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated,\" when an obituary was published in error. Even that report was wrong as what he actually said was \"The report of my illness grew out of his illness, this report of my death was an exaggeration\". That was back in May 1897 (he lived on until 1910). </p> <p>But last week people dying, not dying or simply disappearing became news again. From the ridiculous - Belgian driver Christian Lauwers was shocked to be told she could not get a registration document for her car because she was dead, and became very annoyed when officials in Antwerp refused to accept that she was still alive (their records stated she died in 2002) - to the serious: BBC1's The Day They Disappeared revealed that 200,000 people in Britain apparently walk out on their lives each year, some of them never to be seen again. Some stories had happy endings; Angela spotted her missing son George by chance when collecting a passenger from Heathrow. George had been living at the airport for four years. </p> <p>The police are used to alleged murderers faking suicide Reggie Perrin-style and John Stonehouse, a Labour politician, even tried to disappear from a beach in Florida. It was there, last year, that the alleged serial killer Leonard John Fraser collapsed in court when the prosecutor announced that Natasha Ryan, the girl he was accused of killing, and indeed had confessed to the crime to a prison cell mate, had not died five years earlier but had been found by police hiding in a cupboard at her boyfriend's home. Case dismissed. Her parents had held a memorial service but, believing that she was pregnant, 14-year-old Natasha had simply run away. </p> <p>Disappearing beneficiaries, rather than criminals or their victims, are more normal fare for lawyers and come into focus when a rich deceased person has been generous with his or her money to the extended (but dispersed) family. But media lawyers and journalists should be aware that even in the law of libel things are not always what they seem in life and death. </p> <p>Individuals that publishers might believe to be safely dead and therefore unable to sue have a habit of turning up alive, well and friendly with libel lawyers. In his controversial 1968 play Soldiers, Rolf Hochhuth included the second world war aircrash in which the Polish prime minister in exile was killed. Hochhuth blamed the pilot but, unfortunately for him, the pilot, Captain Prchal, was still alive. He was living in California but was understandably prepared to travel to London to restore his reputation and win \u00a350,000 in libel damages. </p> <p>But even when somebody is actually dead there can still be problems. Victorian prime minister William Gladstone liked to stalk the streets of London seeking to reclaim street prostitutes from a life of vice and this was well known at the time. So were his possibly innocent dalliances with society courtesans such as Lillie Langtry (Punch magazine alluded openly to them). Perhaps to protect his reputation from subsequent trashing, Gladstone burnt a series of letters in 1887 which (he wrote in his diary) \"might in parts have suggested doubt and uneasiness\". He had been writing to the strikingly beautiful courtesan Mrs Dale, finding her so attractive that he commissioned a portrait of her by William Dyce. Stories about politicians and married women are not new news. </p> <p>But Gladstone's efforts were in vain. After his death, the biographers started to put the boot into his reputation and, as a result, Gladstone became involved in a bizarre posthumous libel action when, in 1927, his surviving sons clashed with the author Peter Wright who had alleged that the prime minister was immoral. Gladstone's sons called the author a liar and Wright sued. Wright had been more obsessed with Gladstone's obsession with courtesans and upper class women of fortune than the prostitutes he tried to save and he had named Langtry as one of the prime minister's lovers, which she had furiously denied (she said he was too old, financially a mistake - but those were pre-Max Clifford years). Wright had said that he thought it most improbable that with a mistress on Grosvenor Square (Langtry), Gladstone would go and pick up girls on the street. But, seeking damages from the sons and heirs in the libel courts, he was wholly unable to provide evidence of wrongdoing and was, so the reports at the time said, torn to shreds by counsel for the Gladstone brothers. Author Wright's mistake, like Oscar Wilde's before him (and many, many since), was to try to use the libel courts to protect their own dodgy reputation. </p> <p>When accused of naughtiness in the latter part of his life Gladstone came out with this zippy retort: \"At no period of my life have I been guilty of the act which is known as that of infidelity to the marriage bed\" - the sort of remark that even Bill Clinton would have been proud to call his own. </p> <p>Trite law states that the dead cannot sue for libel but, often overlooked, this does not apply to malicious falsehood where a claim survives for the benefit of the estate. In addition to malice, falsehood and publication, a claimant's estate would also have to show some loss. And claims have been made; a contemporary of Gladstone, a Mr Ratcliffe, was successful in court after alleging that he and his father, who had run an engineering business called Ratcliffe &amp; Sons, had been damaged by a newspaper report that claimed the firm was no longer in business. According to the jury the article was intended to, and did in fact, cause the claimant damage. </p> <p>Even if not defamatory or malicious, an untrue report that someone is dead falls foul of the Press Complaints Commission's code of conduct and Ofcom's codes of practice. It is an obvious inaccuracy which entitles a complainant to a published correction and, most probably, an apology. </p> <p>A public announcement by the appropriate authorities that an individual is believed to be dead would be covered by qualified privilege, so safe, but assuming death is a risky business. People turn up in strange places. A sailor believed to have died on the Argentinian warship General Belgrano was found alive 14 years after it sank. He was listed as missing, and then registered as one of the sailors killed, but was discovered in a mental institution by a cousin in 1996. </p> <p>Who knows, maybe the missing Lord Lucan will turn up this week to sue for libel all those who have accused him, over the past 30 years, of murder. Apart from relying on the limitation period, publishers would struggle to defend his libel claim if he produced some sort of explanation for his strange behaviour. A motorcycle accident on the night perhaps? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Duncan Lamont is a media partner at City solicitors Charles Russell</p>",

  "The Iraqi government, according to its spokesman this weekend, has a vested interest in a peaceful settlement in Najaf. <p>The spokesman might easily have added that among those with a similar interest may now also be numbered the Iraqi people, the US government, its allies, including Britain, and even the wider international order itself. </p> <p>Over the last month, Najaf has become the pivotal confrontation of post-war Iraq. </p> <p>It may seem foolhardy to assert that the entire modern history of a complex military and political situation in a large and unstable place like Iraq rests on the resolution of one relatively small stand-off in a single town. </p> <p>But it is increasingly necessary to see Najaf in that manner. Its potential to affect everything else grows by the day, especially because it is the focus of so many eyes, Iraqi and non-Iraqi alike. </p> <p>Najaf is no longer merely a confrontation between US troops and Moqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi militia. </p> <p>It has also become the place where the world outlook of Iraq's majority Shia population could be settled for perhaps a generation. </p> <p>This weekend that crucial issue continued to hang in the balance. </p> <p>But the stakes are very high. If the Mehdi army finally forces the Americans and their surrogates, the Baghdad government, to back away from the holy city, then al-Sadr will have proved that his guns and implacability can achieve effects that the caution and diplomacy of the older and more moderate Shia leadership answerable to Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani have failed to match. </p> <p>But this is not a good enough reason for crushing al-Sadr. If the Americans, acting on behalf of Ayad Allawi's interim regime in Baghdad, contrive to destroy the holy places, to kill al-Sadr and his band, or, perhaps most misguided of all, if they deal out summary justice to a surrendering militia, then it will not merely be the people of southern Iraq who will have to live with the consequences for decades to come. </p> <p>It could be all of us. In circumstances like Najaf, it is worth remembering a little history. </p> <p>It was not so much what Patrick Pearse and his comrades did in Dublin in 1916 that set the agenda of 20th century Ireland; it was what the British did to them once the rising was over. </p> <p>Once created, martyrs are hard to unmake. </p> <p>That experience is just one reason why Britain should be counselling firmly and publicly against any attempt to crush the Najaf revolt. But there are others. </p> <p>After a long period of relative stability, British troops in Basra and elsewhere in Shia Iraq have recently come under more frequent attack from al-Sadr supporters. </p> <p>A Najaf effect already exists there. But our troops will be under even greater threat if the US or its proxies cross the Rubicon into the Imam Ali shrine. </p> <p>This danger is already real. The Jerusalem Post has recently reported that the Israelis have been training US troops in techniques to combat insurgents in heavily populated areas - in effect exporting the methods of Gaza and the West Bank to Iraq. </p> <p>If that is true then, among other consequences, British ministers will face more harrowing encounters with distraught relatives demanding to know why their sons and daughters have died in a conflict over which Britain has so little control. </p> <p>Where Najaf is concerned, therefore, no news is almost good news. </p> <p>The failure of either side to defeat the other should be welcomed. What is needed in Najaf is for the interests of majority Shia opinion - which still supports neither the Mehdi army nor the Americans - to prevail. If that involves a setback for the US and for the Allawi government, then so be it. </p> <p>The outcome in Najaf will shape the balance of power in whatever Iraqi society and state emerges from the current insecurity. </p> <p>But it could even settle the question of whether it is possible for a workable Iraqi state to survive at all within the existing borders. We may want Najaf resolved - but it should not be at any price.</p>",
  "<p>When Matthew Pinsent was asked, in the aftermath of Saturday's triumph, if he had ever reached further down into his own resources, he thought hard and remembered a more physically exhausting race, one from 10 years ago, in which he and Steve Redgrave had needed to come from a long way back. Saturday's final, by contrast, had been neck and neck all the way, with a different kind of demand. Then he thought some more. </p> <p>\"But emotionally, no,\" he said finally. \"Nothing touches this.\" </p> <p>Those who were on the river bank to witness Pinsent's helpless tears at the end of the coxless fours final could eulogise forever, and probably will, about a race of matchless drama, a herculean struggle won by not much more than the span of a man's hand. The emotional scenes at its conclusion will also be part of the story. </p> <p>But the man with the clearest idea of what Pinsent achieved while winning his fourth Olympic gold medal was his opposite number in a phenomenally competitive Canada boat. And Barney Williams, who will report for post-graduate law studies at Oxford University next month and hopes to be selected for next year's Boat Race crew, paid Pinsent the ultimate compliment by claiming that he would rather have lost such a memorable race by 0.08 seconds than win a gold medal by a distance. </p> <p>\"There's no one else I would have accepted being beaten by,\" Williams said an hour after matching Pinsent stroke for stroke yet losing by the narrowest of margins. \"He's a phenomenal person to compete against. He's very humble. He's a very quiet competitor. He doesn't do anything brash and in your face. He just goes out and performs phenomenally well. </p> <p>\"The fact that we were part of one of the most exciting races of all time is as stimulating to me as winning a gold medal by three or four seconds. Because, if you win by three or four seconds, the race is there and it's gone. Congratulations - you've done your job, you dominated the field, thanks a lot. </p> <p>\"But this race might still be talked about. People will be talking about the fact that Matthew won his fourth gold medal but they'll also be talking about the fact that someone made it very difficult for him to do that.\" </p> <p>Pinsent knows that he will be the focus of public interest but he was concerned to share the praise with James Cracknell, Steve Williams and Ed Coode. </p> <p>\"What we did today was the product of all four of us,\" Pinsent said. \"I looked at those guys today and I needed stuff from them just as they needed stuff from me.\" </p> <p>On Saturday he had already changed his Olympic accreditation from \"athlete\" to \"IOC member\". Today he will be acting as an official observer at the canoe-kayak events, followed by a visit to the cycling. But he will be spending much of his time calmly deflecting all the inevitable questions about his interest in staying on to 2008 in an attempt to match Redgrave's five gold medals. By that time he will be 37, and his 108kg physique may be harder to control. </p> <p>He would need a month or so to think about it, he said. The aftermath of a triumph such as Saturday's, and the applause of a massive crowd of supporters, tended to push the memory of harsh weeks of winter training on the Thames to the back of the mind. And experience is telling him that the immediate future will be hard enough to cope with. </p> <p>\"I know that for three weeks or a month what happened today won't make sense,\" he said. \"My wife will tell you that after Sydney I was completely bipolar. On cloud nine one moment, in the depths of despair the next. A nightmare to be with. Losing my medal, losing my passport. Wanting to party one minute, wanting to go to sleep the next. I'm ready for that and I hope I'm ready for all the madness that will descend when we get home.\" </p> <p>Before that he and his wife would be spending some time in Athens with the Redgraves. \"Whether I talk to Steve about retirement or not, I don't know. It won't be him I'm dragging down to the river. It'll be myself. And it's a marriage issue, as well. What I do with my life affects my wife. I think she'll be the first port of call. </p> <p>\"To be honest, whenever I've spoken in glowing terms about how much I want to retire, about how I hate training on cold mornings, she's always said, 'You should carry on.' She sees how happy it makes me, in the long term. And a day like this changes your life.

  "<p>Forty years ago, when A Hard Day's Night was at the top of the hit parade and Sir Alec Douglas (later, Lord) Home was prime minister, a long-haired teenage Glaswegian anarchist was arrested in Madrid on a mission to assassinate General Franco with some plastic explosives he had smuggled across the border from France under his woolly jumper. He faced the possibility of death by Franco's favoured method of execution, the garrotte. </p> <p>He was spared that dance of death and served his sentence in Spain, only to return to England and, a few years later, find himself in the dock at the Old Bailey, accused of being a member of the Angry Brigade, which had been engaged in its own, more modest, efforts to change society in Britain. Now Stuart Christie, that young anarchist, is a 58-year-old freelance writer and publisher, husband and father, living in a seaside town in the south of England. Next week his autobiography, Granny Made Me An Anarchist, will be published. </p> <p>My first political demonstration, as a law student in Edinburgh, was when we marched down the high street in a torchlight procession carrying an effigy of said anarchist with a garrotte round his neck to protest against the arrest. The generalissimo was clearly frightened by this. Christie was sentenced to a mere 20 years in jail. </p> <p>\"I wish you'd kept the effigy,\" says Christie, now smartly turned out in a suit and a Christie tartan tie, when we meet in his local winebar. What Christie did keep, throughout his time inside and ever since, was his sense of humour: Granny Made Me An Anarchist is a wonderfully funny, engaging and self-deprecating account of a life that might easily have been snuffed out all those years ago in the shadows of Carabanchel prison, an account peppered with cultural and political reference points, from Just William and Leslie Howard in Pimpernel Smith, to Hegel and Hank Locklin's Wild Side of Life, to C Day Lewis and Bu\u00f1uel's Viridiana. </p> <p>Born in Partick, the son of a hard-drinking trawlerman and a hairdresser, Christie was named after the country's best-known Stuart, Bonnie Prince Charlie - \"the only man in history to be named after three separate sheepdogs\" as his fellow Partiquois, Billy Connolly, once said. His father departed one day for the legendary packet of fags and did not return for 20 years, so young Stuart was brought up by his mum, his grandad and his redoubtable, eponymous gran. </p> <p>She had been in service all her life, growing up in the gatekeeper's house in Lochnaw Castle in Galloway. He describes her ethical make-up as \"equal parts John Knox and village community.\" </p> <p>\"Basically, what she did was provide a moral barometer which married almost exactly with that of libertarian socialism and anarchism, and she provided the star which I followed,\" he says. \"She kept me on the straight and narrow and was a real influence in my life.\" </p> <p>The straight and narrow was soon to take a few twists. As an apprentice in a dental laboratory, Christie joined the Labour party Young Socialists in Glasgow, one of whose members was a young Daily Record reporter called Paul Foot. He did not linger there long. \"I was soon disillusioned with the chicanery of Labour politics, and [I was disgusted] with the executive committee going out with Rangers scarves on to make sure that the Protestant candidates were accepted.\" It was the early 60s and the US Polaris nuclear submarines had been sited at the Holy Loch. Christie joined the Scottish Committee of 100, which was dedicated to their removal and whose direct-action politics appealed. </p> <p>\"The idea of revolution was quite alive in Scotland at the time,\" he says. \"There was the political radicalisation of the 50s, satire, rock music and the collapse of the credibility of the Communist party.\" But a greater influence was Spain and the cause that had prompted many of his compatriots to join the International Brigade a quarter of a century earlier. He moved south to London where he worked as a sheet-metal apprentice and on an ironmongery stall in Shepherd's Bush. He met Spanish anarchist exiles in Bristol and decided that \"I had to do more than just demonstrate and leaflet. I offered my services.\" The mission he was assigned was to deliver explosives to Madrid for the latest attempt - the 30th, as it happened - to blow up Franco. In Paris, he met his fellow desperadoes, who were tickled when he introduced himself with the phrase, \"Zut alors!\" His limited knowledge of French had led him to believe that that was what one said in the circumstances. </p> <p>Was he frightened? \"Not really,\" he says. \"It was fun. I got an adrenaline buzz and I was doing good at the same time. No one knew. My mother thought I was grape-picking.\" He hitchhiked south, having packed his kilt, which he had found was a great way to get lifts. This was to lead to some confusion: it was reported in the Argentinian press that the man trying to kill Franco was a Scots transvestite. </p> <p>But the movement had already been heavily infiltrated, and Christie was arrested at the handover spot in Madrid, along with his Spanish contact. He was not tortured but his companion was, in front of him. He signed a confession after four days and was jailed. </p> <p>In prison, he was warmly welcomed. The anarchists sent him money, but did not want to use their own names so signed them with the only English names they knew: John, Paul, George and Ringo. The prison authorities assumed he was being funded by the Beatles. </p> <p>His incarceration prompted many protests, including from Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertrand Russell. \"I was told by the British consul that there were demonstrations all over the world. The most beneficial thing was that my arrest provided a focus for what Franco was doing. Here he was trying to pass himself off as an old avuncular gentleman on a white charger while in fact he had all these political prisoners, thousands of them who were tortured and some of them killed. The monster was growing again.\" </p> <p>One of his unlikely supporters was the late Malcolm Muggeridge, the author, journalist and television pundit who, on a programme called Why Anarchism?, had asked Christie just before his mission to Spain if he thought it was justifiable to assassinate Franco. \"I knew I was going to Spain, and here I was presenting myself as a radical revolutionary anarchist, so what could I do but say yes,\" says Christie. \"He sent me a Christmas card every year for the rest of his life.\" </p> <p>In prison he studied for A-levels in history, English and Spanish and read anarchist books smuggled into the jail. His mother wrote to Franco to ask for clemency. The Spanish authorities responded to what they described as \"her dignity and motherly concern\" and released him after three-and-a-half years. </p> <p>In London, Christie became friends with some of the people who were later to form the Angry Brigade which, in the early 70s, carried out a number of small bombing expeditions aimed at the Ted Heath government. Not entirely to his surprise, he was arrested again and faced another 20 years in jail, but at his trial at the Old Bailey he told the jury that the police had planted two detonators on him and was acquitted. </p> <p>But rearrest, he soon realised, would only be a matter of time. He moved first to Yorkshire and then to Sanday in the Orkneys, an island that had the twin advantages of a complete absence of officers of the law and a plentiful supply of Glenmorangie. </p> <p>Now married, for the next seven years he worked on local farms, ran the anarchist Cienfuegos Press and started a radical newspaper called the Free-winged Eagle. The local minister denounced him as \"the anti-Christ\" and advised his parishioners to boycott it. A degree in history and politics followed. There was a job as sub-editor for the launch of Media Week and a series of other magazine ventures which included editing the British edition of Pravda - \"I said I'd do it as long as I didn't have to join the politburo\". His past has not dogged him. \"Occasionally, I would be introduced to someone and they would say: 'You're not that Stuart Christie?' and my response is, 'You mean the west of Scotland ballroom dancing champion?' The poor guy had the same name as me.\" </p> <p>He voted for the first time in the European elections. \"I voted against Tony Blair and for Respect. The furore it caused from anarchists when it appeared on a website! The next thing, I'm getting emails from Italy saying, 'What are you doing voting?' It was because of the war primarily, but also everything else. I can feel the hairs on the back of my neck when I see Blair on television. He has subverted the good name of Scottish radicalism with the people he surrounds himself with.\" </p> <p>He is glad, after everything, that his assassination attempt was unsuccessful. \"The arrest turned out for the better. I probably did more for the cause of anti-Francoism by not killing him. There is that law of unintended consequences.\" Now he is working on a documentary about the Spanish civil war and thinking of a novel about a Scot joining the International Brigade. Current reading is Hadrian the Seventh by Baron Corvo, \"and I'm trying to plough my way through Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, an extraordinary book written in the 17th century, full of insights.\" Just like granny.</p>",
  "By August 6 1964, everything was ready for my mission. My ticket had been booked on the night train from Paris to Toulouse. I met Bernardo and Salvador, my Spanish anarchist contacts from London, at the place d'Italie, and from there we walked down the rue Bobilot and into a narrow and neglected side street with grubby grey tenements. <p>Checking to ensure we had not been followed, Salva gave a prearranged knock on the curtained street-floor window and, when the door opened, we filed quickly through the dark and narrow hallway and into the front room. This was the quartermaster's stores, where the weapons, explosives and forged documents could be kept with some degree of safety. </p> <p>Three people were already in the room. Two were seated, one of whom I recognised as Octavio Alberola, the charismatic coordinator of the underground anarchist group Defensa Interior, and the man on whose shoulders lay the responsibility for killing Franco.The third man, referred to as \"the chemist\", was standing by the sink wearing rubber gloves, measuring and pouring chemicals. </p> <p>Being thirsty, I went to the sink for water, and was about to put a glass to my lips when the chemist turned round and saw what I was doing. He shouted at me to stop and rushed across, removing the glass carefully from my hands, explaining that it had just been used for measuring pure sulphuric acid. </p> <p>Shaken, I stood back to lean on the sideboard and went to light a cigarette. This triggered another equally volcanic reaction from the chemist as he explained that the sideboard drawer was full of detonators. I retreated to the table, and was very cautious after that. </p> <p>The chemist placed on the table five slabs of what looked like king-size bars of my granny's home-made tablet (a crumbly Scottish toffee similar to butter fudge), each containing 200 grams of plastic explosive, along with detonators. </p> <p>Alberola went through the details of the operation while Salva translated. My job was to deliver the explosives to the contact, together with a letter, addressed to me, which I was to collect from the American Express offices in Madrid. Then, at a rendezvous in the plaza de Moncloa, the contact would identify me by a handkerchief wrapped around one of my hands. He would approach me and say, \"Qu\u00e9 tal?\" (\"How are you?\"), to which I was to reply, \"Me duele la mano\" (\"I've a sore hand\"). </p> <p>I spoke no Spanish, so to avoid the embarrassment of forgetting my lines and unloading a kilo of high explosives on the first friendly Spaniard I met, Octavio wrote the words down for me, along with all the instructions. (This was, with hindsight, extremely foolish.) Once the contact had identified himself, I was to hand over the parcel, together with the letter, and leave immediately. </p> <p>My train pulled into Toulouse station shortly before dawn on Friday August 7 after a clammy and uncomfortable night. After a hurried coffee and croissant I caught a train to Perpignan. Here, I prepared myself for crossing the border; I would hitchhike the rest of the way to Madrid. </p> <p>The best way to take the explosives in, I thought, was on my body, not in my rucksack in case it was searched by a punctilious customs officer. In Perpignan, I found the public baths and paid for a cubicle. After a hot soak, and still naked, I unpacked the slabs of plastique, and taped them to my chest and stomach with Elastoplasts and adhesive tape. The detonators I wrapped in cotton wool and hid inside the lining of my jacket. </p> <p>With the plastic explosive strapped to me, my body was improbably misshapen. The only way to disguise myself was with the baggy woollen jumper my granny had knitted to protect me from the biting Clydeside winds. At the risk of understatement, I looked out of place on the Mediterranean coast in August. </p> <p>I walked through the outskirts of Perpignan until I came to a junction with a road sign pointing to Spain. After what seemed like hours, a car pulled over. It was driven by a middle-aged English commercial traveller from Dagenham. He was going to Barcelona. </p> <p>It soon became apparent that his charity was driven to a large extent by enlightened self-interest. Every few kilometres the old banger would chug to a standstill and I would have to get out in the full blast of the August Mediterranean sun and push the bloody car up the foothills until we got it bump-started. Between pushing a car uphill and granny's jumper, the sweat began rolling off me. Waterproof tape was yet to have been invented, and the cellophane-wrapped packets of plastique began slipping from my body. I had to keep nudging them up with my forearms. </p> <p>Traffic was heavy when we reached Le P\u00e9rthus, the busiest of Spain's frontier mountain passes. This was where we would have to clear a customs check. On the other side was fascist Spain. </p> <p>After queuing for a bowel-churning eternity, I had to push the car on to the ramp while my companion steered. I pulled my jumper taut and waited with my heart in my mouth while two dour-faced Civil Guards with shiny patent-leather three-cornered hats and sub-machine guns at the ready looked me up and down. I handed my passport over to the border guard while the customs officers examined the boot and searched behind the seats of the car. </p> <p>\"Why have you come to Spain?\" </p> <p>\"Turista!\" I replied, hoping my accent didn't make it sound like \"terrorista\". </p> <p>A pair of dark eyes looked at me suspiciously for a moment before the stamp finally descended on the passport. </p> <p>The car made it as far as Gerona's main square, where it broke down again, this time in the middle of the rush hour. Eventually we got going again and before I knew it we were driving through the dilapidated red-roofed outskirts of industrial Barcelona. </p> <p>\"I never thought we'd make it,\" said my companion. </p> <p>\"Neither did I,\" was my reply. </p> <p>We said goodbye and went our separate ways. </p> <p>The possible dates for my rendezvous in Madrid were from Tuesday 11 to Friday 14 August. I left Barcelona on Monday, this time keeping the explosives in my bag. I could have flown or taken the train, but I enjoyed hitch-hiking and it also meant I would have a bit more money in the event of any emergency. </p> <p>My destination in the capital was the American Express office. Instead of going to the railway station for a left-luggage locker and leaving my rucksack there, which is what a more experienced anarchist would have done, I swung it on to my back and strolled down the carrera San Jer\u00f3nimo to collect the letter for my contact. </p> <p>It was siesta time and the streets were quiet. Turning the corner to enter the American Express office, I was immediately aware of three smartly dressed and tight-lipped men in heavy-rimmed sunglasses standing by the entrance muttering among themselves. I breathed deeply and tried to control my anxiety. Walking past this group, I went into the American Express office where I asked for the poste restante desk. A clerk pointed me in the direction of a desk at the far end of the room. </p> <p>Handing my passport to the receptionist I asked whether any letters were waiting for me. At this same moment I noticed out of the corner of my eye two men and a woman sitting in an alcove to my right. Again, I knew immediately they were police. The blood and lymph drained from my face and heart. My stomach churned. Something had gone badly wrong. </p> <p>The girl with my passport found my letter among the tightly packed trays behind her and pulled it out. As she did, I noticed it had been marked with a pink piece of paper the size of a bookie's slip. The woman from the alcove, a supervisor, approached the girl, now bringing the letter to me, said a few words to her and removed the slip. </p> <p>What was in the letter? How much did they know? Would I be arrested there or would they wait until I had met my contact? But if they knew about the Amex pick-up, they probably knew the details of my rendezvous as well. </p> <p>The supervisor handed the slip to the girl, indicating she should take it across to the two men in the alcove. The supervisor then handed me the letter and my passport. I turned to see the two men from the alcove quickly walking out. I made a mental note to shaft American Express at every conceivable opportunity, if I were ever again offered an opportunity. </p> <p>My diaphragm tightened even more and my heart thumped like a tight Lambeg drum. Yet I felt curiously detached as I took a deep breath and walked out of the office, trying to keep my face expressionless. Mustering all the confidence I could, I paused at the doorway to look at the group of five men now standing to one side of the entrance. Until I appeared at the doorway they had been deep in conversation. They stopped briefly, exchanging knowing looks with one another, and carried on. </p> <p>Attempting the jaunty air of a well-heeled tourist who had just cashed his letters of credit, I walked back the way I had come, and as slowly as I could. I had only gone a few yards when the knot of men began to follow me up the street, still talking among themselves. My eyes darted everywhere, desperately searching for any opportunity to escape. I continued up the carrera San Jeronimo, stopping to peer in shop windows I passed, as though I was window shopping, but in fact to see how far they were behind. They had allowed me a 20 yards' start before moving, and they kept to that distance. </p> <p>An empty taxi pulled in to the pavement beside me. But when the driver appeared to invite me to get in, I knew it was an undercover police car. I was being hemmed in. </p> <p>By this time I had reached the corner of the busy calle Cedaceros. As I steeled myself to make a dash through the crowds I was suddenly grabbed by both arms from behind, my face pushed to the wall and a gun barrel thrust into the small of my back. I tried to turn my head but I was handcuffed before I fully realised what had happened. It was all over in a matter of moments. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This is an edited extract from Granny Made Me An Anarchist, by Stuart Christie, published by Sribner on September 6</p>",
  "<p>BBC soap-opera pioneer Matthew Robinson is wrestling with what he describes as his most comprehensive challenge yet - setting up a media campaign to persuade Cambodians to stop calling a condom a \"hygienic bag\". The profoundly unsexy term in the Khmer language presents a big barrier to tackling the country's HIV/Aids problem, which is now the worst in south-east Asia. </p> <p>Robinson, former executive producer of EastEnders and Byker Grove and head of drama for BBC Wales, is creating a soap promoting a new name for the condom - \"Mr Help\", which in Khmer sounds like \"Mr Sex\". If the plan succeeds it could help prevent many of the country's annual 20,000 Aids deaths. His simmering hospital drama, Taste Of Life, will save even more lives if it educates Cambodia's poor that washing hands after defecating helps prevent diarrhoea. One-in-three children in the country die before the age of five from preventable diseases. </p> <p>The soap hits the screens shortly after a lightning pre-production phase. Almost all of the young production team have had to be trained from scratch in just three months because most of the country's previous media professionals were wiped out by Pol Pot. The soap's director is a former law student with no previous TV experience. The production manager is a restaurant manager who runs the show from 7am to 7pm then works until 11pm to keep his real business afloat. </p> <p>The ability and commitment of his young charges has electrified Robinson.\"A few months ago most of these people had never seen one end of a camera from another; now you walk on to our set and it is as professional as any film crew I have ever seen anywhere in Europe,\" he says. </p> <p>Robinson adopted the novel recruitment technique of approaching the top colleges in Phnom Penh to ask for the best students. \"The Khmers are extraordinarily bright people who have had a tragic history. They all want to get on - they want to do something to help their country.\" </p> <p>None of the scriptwriters - the oldest of whom is 23, and the youngest just 18 - has written before, and they come to the office to fashion individual episodes while working to ensure that characters and storylines remain coherent. </p> <p>There is a fascinating contrast between the first episode of Taste of Life and the first episode of EastEnders, which Robinson directed. \"On EastEnders in '85 you had to scream for attention in a crowded [TV] marketplace at peak time. Here, there's nothing to compete with - the Cambodians will be fascinated to see themselves portrayed. So far they have just been given karaoke videos and very stylised Chinese-style drama with characters shouting at each other and performing backflips.\" </p> <p>The production process has also been easier in many ways. Robinson drew up plans for a set thought to be the biggest in south-east Asia - 2,200 square metres. The next day the bulldozers moved in to start work on the foundations of a warehouse, a nursing home, a bar, and a new hospital so realistic that a notice on the gate warns locals not to bring in the sick. Five months later filming started. In the UK he would still have been waiting for planning permission. </p> <p>The costs are minuscule. EastEnders costs more than \u00a3100,000 an episode; Taste of Life around \u00a35,000. But even that is expensive by Cambodian standards, where gameshows are churned out for just \u00a3160 a programme. This means the project will end in three years unless new funds can be found. </p> <p>It is being run by the BBC World Service Trust with a three-year \u00a33.3m grant from the UK Department for International Development. The covert public-health messages embedded in the soap script are amplified by a parallel radio and TV ad campaign. </p> <p>Giselle Portenier, the former Newsnight and Panorama producer who is running the project, hopes it will help to create a sexual revolution in Cambodia. \"Some of the women in the series will have sex without a condom and will get HIV. This is going to be very racy for Cambodians,\" she says. \"We have tested the drama on about 100 people and unequivocally they loved it - they thought it represented reality in Cambodian society.\" </p> <p>The project is strongly supported by the Cambodian government. The new women's minister, Ing Kantha Phavy, says: \"This is going to be rather shocking to some of our people. But this is a challenge, and sometimes how you can address a challenge is to shock the culture and traditions of a society. It's a matter of how to protect life.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Roger Harrabin is a correspondent for Radio 4's Today programme.</p>",
  "A hunt began yesterday for The Scream and another masterpiece by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch after they were snatched in a daytime raid at a gallery in Oslo. <p>Tourists were forced to lie on the floor as two armed robbers pulled The Scream and The Madonna off the wall and ran to a waiting car. No shots were fired. The frames were later found dumped. </p> <p>In 1994, another version of The Scream disappeared from the city's National Gallery. It was recovered undamaged. </p> <p>With at least 70 people in the Munch Museum yesterday morning, there was no shortage of witness accounts. \"I saw one of the men put a gun right behind a guard's head,\" said Richard Marcus, 63, of Texas. \"What was almost the most shocking thing was seeing a gun being used here in Oslo.\" </p> <p>Elena Martin, a 28-year-old Spanish engineer who saw the theft, said: \"A guy wearing a grey sweatshirt and a black balaclava hood ran into the room. He went first to the Madonna and took it off the wall then put it on the floor. </p> <p>\"Then he pulled The Scream off the wall. He put them under his arms and ran out of the room. There was no alarm.\" </p> <p>Other accounts suggested the guards themselves had been ordered to remove the paintings from the wall. </p> <p>A ransom demand is seen as the most likely development as experts said The Scream, valued at \u00a333m-\u00a341m, could not be sold on the open market. </p> <p>\"These are crucial paintings in art history,\" Gunnar Sorensen, the head of the Munch Museum said yesterday. \"I'm very afraid for the pictures because they were treated in a very rough way.\"</p>",
  "The first anyone heard was a crash as the two armed robbers, masked in balaclavas, careered into plate glass doors at the front of the Munch Museum. <p>In their adrenalin-psyched eagerness to snatch one of the most renowned and valuable of modern paintings, the gang reportedly misjudged the gallery's sequence of automatic sliding doors. </p> <p>But the blundering entrance - which startled Sunday morning tourists drifting through the gallery and alerted security guards - was followed by a rapidly executed theft. </p> <p>Armed robberies are highly unusual in galleries and the daylight attack raises fears that more costly forms of protection may be needed. The art world has traditionally taken precautions to defeat the guile of cat burglars rather than aggressive smash and grab operations. </p> <p>Suspicions for yesterday's raid focused immediately upon the perpetrators of a series of armed bank robberies elsewhere in Norway this summer. They were characterised by careful planning, frequently involving gunmen pushing their way into banks shortly after they opened and before staff had time to get organised. </p> <p>According to reports, the gang was at times 15-strong and several members appeared to have had military training. </p> <p>Why anyone would want to steal a painting as well known as Edvard Munch's The Scream is a mystery. The belief that masterpieces are stolen to order for wealthy private collectors is no longer widely credited. A ransom demand at some future date seems more likely. </p> <p>\"We're following all possible leads ... but we don't know who did this,\" Detective Chief Inspector Kjell Pedersen told a news conference yesterday. One of the thieves spoke in Norwegian during the robbery. </p> <p>Painted in 1893, The Scream has come to be seen as an icon representing humanity's existential alienation. Ten years ago another version - Munch painted four - was stolen from Norway's nearby National Gallery; a former footballer and prankster with a Munch obsession was among a gang of four jailed. They had planned to ransom it for $1m. </p> <p>That infamous theft involved a ladder run up against the wall of the gallery at night, a shattered window pane and a picture postcard - featuring three men laughing uproariously - left on the wall inscribed with the message \"Thanks for the poor security\". At the time the painting was estimated to be worth \u00a348m. </p> <p>Yesterday's raid, though equally audacious, was less subtle. External security had recently been tightened at the Munch Museum, a low-rise glass and concrete building in the heart of the capital. </p> <p>Some 100,000 visitors a year stroll through the galleries. There are guards - albeit unarmed - in every room. On Sundays there are escorted, lunchtime tours. So the robbers, brandishing at least one pistol, struck soon after opening and before the crowds arrived. </p> <p>\"Two men rushed into the museum but crashed into the glass doors first of all,\" Jorunn Christoffersen, the museum's spokeswoman said. \"They tried to push them open. The noise attracted the guards who went to see what was happening. </p> <p>\"The thieves knew where the paintings were. They pointed pistols at the guards. They pulled [The Scream] and another important work by Munch, The Madonna, off the wall. Both paintings are priceless. They would, like the Mona Lisa, be impossible to sell. </p> <p>\"No shots were fired but people were very scared. We are still shocked. It's a terrible thing to happen. The Scream is painted on cardboard and very fragile.\" </p> <p>Both pictures were attached to the wall with wire which had been electronically alarmed. The alarms, Norwegian detectives explained yesterday, made no sound but triggered a police response. By the time the first squad car arrived, however, the robbers had already fled in their getaway car, a black Audi A6 estate which was later found abandoned. </p> <p>A German tourist, Marc Michl, 24, said: \"I heard screaming and ran up the stairs. I saw a man carrying a black gun and wearing a black mask. Another man was running away with two pictures under his arms. The gun was quite long; it might have had a silencer attached to it.\" </p> <p>Fran\u00e7ois Castang, a producer with the France Musique radio station, was visiting the museum and stood in front of The Scream just minutes before the robbers burst in. He said he was staggered by the lack of security at the museum. </p> <p>\"Both the stolen works were in the first room, very close to the entrance and exit, about a 100-metre dash from the nearest place a car could have been waiting,\" he said. \"They were not attached to the wall in any way but just suspended from thin wires. All anyone needed to do was exert a little downward pressure and they'd come off in their hands.\" </p> <p>Mr Castang said there was \"no glass in front of the paintings, no alarm system like in French museums when a bell rings if visitors get too close, not even a cordon to keep people back a certain distance. There was no search of people's bags at the entrance and the guards were nowhere to be seen. There was so little security that I remember saying to myself as I walked in: it would really be really easy to steal some thing from here.\" He said he thought the minimal security \"must be a cultural thing with the Norwegians. They trust people.\" </p> <p>Both The Madonna, also painted in 1893-94, and The Scream are sizeable pictures, measuring 2ft by 3ft. </p> <p>However well planned, the execution was less than perfect. Police said the robbers dropped the pictures twice as they fled. And, according to Reuters, the frames were later found elsewhere in Oslo, smashed and scattered along a city street, reinforcing fears the paintings may have been damaged. </p> <p><b>History of theft - from US to France, Goya to Da Vinci</b></p> <p><b> 1911</b> </p> <p>French borders were sealed when the Mona Lisa disappeared from the Louvre. Vincenzo Perugia believed Leonardo da Vinci's picture should be returned to Italy so he stole the masterpiece by hiding it under his smock while alone in the room.

Unemployed Kempton Bunton confessed to carrying the painting out under his arm, saying he had stolen it as a protest against pensioners having to pay for TV licences. He sent a ransom note to Lord Robbins, a gallery trustee, demanding \u00a35,000 for its return. He returned the painting and later served three months </p> <p><b> March 1990</b> </p> <p>\u00a3180m worth of pictures was stolen from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, in America's biggest art heist.

  "The home secretary, David Blunkett, was put on the back foot by the asylum controversy again yesterday when it emerged that statistics showing record numbers of immigrants may have been delayed on ministerial advice. <p>The accusation was made by MigrationWatch, whose unlikely head, the former ambassador Sir Andrew Green, claimed that the Home Office was so concerned about his activities that it had set up a unit to monitor and counter his message that immigration into Britain is out of control.</p> <p>With most opinion polls showing that asylum-related issues are important to many voters, including Labour supporters, the accusations are potentially damaging to ministers. They were reported in the Sunday Times, which has been campaigning against \"lax\" government policy.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett's Tory shadow, David Davis, was quick to protest that the Office of National Statistics (ONS) should not have asked government advice on the timing of its publication of migration data.</p> <p>According to the paperwork obtained by Sir Andrew under the access to government information code, which allows him to see what files they hold about him, an email said: \"Ministers would like us to be in a position to be able to respond to, and to be ahead of, some of the ideas, facts and figures they [the group] are promulgating ... [and] we need to form a small network of people to act in the same flexible way, fleet-of-foot way as MigrationWatch.\"</p> <p>That was not all. A proposed Home Office rebuttal in January 2003 stressed the independence of the ONS. It is a sensitive issue which has also put the statisticians at loggerheads with Tory MPs on voter-sensitive topics such as productivity levels in the NHS.</p> <p>Last September an internal email from another Home Office official said: \"ONS are asking for views on two proposals for producing the population projections...</p> <p>\"Appreciate you and press office may prefer options two [to delay publication], not least to avoid renewed attacks from MigrationWatch in the short term.\" </p> <p>That appears to suggest that the ONS was willing to delay the news that net immigration rose by 172,000 in 2001, and happened because of what was called a \"small error'.' </p> <p>The ONS was not replying to calls yesterday. But the Home Office said it was \"common practice\" to brief ministers on potentially \"inaccurate or misleading\" claims, so that an honest public debate could occur. </p> <p>\"The Home Office regularly monitors estimates and statistics by organisations such as MigrationWatch and in the media,\" a spokesman said. \"We believe MigrationWatch has produced statistics that give an over-inflated picture of levels of migration, and this is damaging to public confidence.\" </p> <p>Mr Davis told the Sunday Times: \"It is wholly wrong of the ONS to seek instructions. It just shouldn't be offering those options. An independent statistical organisation shouldn't be seeking any views on when to publish.\" </p> <p>Both sides leapt on a claim that a new version of Sangatte refugee camp, closed last year at Mr Blunkett's instigation, has been allowed near the Channel tunnel at Calais. </p> <p>\"This is not a second Sangatte, which was an official camp providing shelter, food and facilities to up to 1,500 people while they attempted to gain illegal entry into the UK,\" the Home Office said. </p> <p>\"Since the home secretary secured closure of Sangatte there have frequently been small numbers of people who have slept rough while trying to jump on the back of lorries bound for the UK. We continue to work closely with the French authorities to enforce border controls.\" </p> <p>Mr Blunkett, who is on holiday abroad, has dismissed MigrationWatch as a \"tinpot\" organisation, but is acutely aware of the way that inflammatory claims, true and false, made tabloid headlines. </p> <p>He wants what officials call a \"more rationale debate\" on the issue, not least the case for the \"managed migration\" of people whose skills, and youth, may be needed.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>AGONY IN ATHENS</b></p> <p>\"She had imploded and it made a piteous sight,\" says the Guardian. Indeed, Paul Radcliffe's agony spills over on to the front pages of today's papers - distraught in the FT, crouching on the kerb with her head hidden in her arms in the Independent.</p> <p>The British runner, who was favourite to win the women's marathon in Athens, dropped out 36km into the race after falling to fourth place. \"No one remembers who came fourth,\" she said after her last attempt at the Olympics four years ago.</p> <p>\"What an effort. What a heroine,\" says the Sun in what appears to have been a hastily rewritten editorial. Watching Britons lose brings out the most generous instincts of the press, and today is no exception.</p> <p>\"Now we know why they say long-distance running is the loneliest job in sport,\" writes Paul Hayward in the Telegraph. \"On the most savagely hot day of the Games so far, 82 women set off in 35-degree temperatures down the route taken by Pheidippides the messenger who lost his life to fatigue after telling the people of Athens that the battle with the Persians had been won.\"</p> <p>\"Although she led the pack from the early stages past a quick-shifting backdrop of Orthodox churches and car dealerships along the freshly paved road, she never managed to shake free from the best of her rivals,\" says the Herald Tribune.</p> <p>Sixteen of the runners failed to finish at all; the other two British women came in 25th and 29th. At the end of the course, in the Panathinaiko stadium's stone tunnel, \"super-fit women lay around in physical disarray\", reports Hayward.

  "Arise, Mrs Blair; kneel, Ms Booth. The news that <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2004/0906/068.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Forbes magazine</a> has voted Cherie the 12th most powerful woman in the world - special category, Wives - must seem a bitter irony to a woman with an acute sense of self-reliance. <p>Not just to her, either. When the house journal of the American entrepreneur lauds Condoleezza Rice (number one) and Laura Bush (number four) in the same breath, anyone with a vote should begin to wonder about what exactly Forbes means by power - and how women might go about getting it.</p> <p>Until the 1960s, a vociferous school of pre-feminist thinking subscribed to the notion that a well-educated woman could, through her husband or lover, exert quite as much influence as he would alone. It was a comforting thought for an ambitious woman without the right to education or the vote. Undoubtedly, some did succeed in making their mark on a particular policy or driving their partners forward to greater endeavour. The pity of it is that Forbes can confuse these admirable intentions with true power.</p> <p>Let's take Laura Bush, whom Forbes says was responsible for \"turning around\" her husband and \"putting him on the path to the White House\". This is a woman, let's remember, who may well be evicted from the White House in a few months' time on the basis of her husband's performance as president.</p> <p>\"When it comes to an unruly press,\" drivels the magazine, \"reporters sit up and take note of what Mrs Bush says, thanks to her calm, commanding and reassuring demeanour\".</p> <p>Extraordinary though it is to read a journalist confessing how much their profession enjoys a woman bringing them to heel - and the sentiment is horribly familiar from the Thatcher years - no one can deny that Mrs Bush has had a lot to say about women on the campaign trail this year. Last week she reminded an audience in Missouri that Ms Rice and Margaret Spellings both hold senior positions in the Bush administration. \"That means in the White House, women are in charge of everything abroad and everything at home. That sounds about right to me.\"</p> <p>(More of this kind of nonsense appears in Forbes' biography of the 22nd most powerful woman, the Queen. \"She has shepherded her country through numerous geopolitical crises with a firm hand,\" says the magazine. If Britons really believed that, her realm would surely have become a republic decades ago.)</p> <p>Cosy rhetoric is one thing. Self-delusion is another. But what made Forbes put Cherie, whom it egregiously describes as \"Britain's first lady\", at number 12? To her credit - and, indeed, to that of the Queen - she rarely plays the female empowerment card. The British public simply wouldn't let her.</p> <p>In any case, the fragile persona of the PM's wife couldn't sustain the burden of greatness. This is a woman whose voice few Britons have ever heard; whose last major appearance before the press took the form of a choked confession that she was \"not superwoman\" and should not, please, be blamed for asking a conman to find her son a flat in Bristol.</p> <p>Pilloried after she empathised over lunch with the plight of Palestinian suicide bombers, the wonder is not that Cherie can comment intelligently about female prisoners and human rights law, but that she does it at all. And that, presumably, is what really impressed the meritocratic American judges at Forbes: the wonder that a woman can be born to greatness, or have greatness thrust upon her, and still have an opinion worth heeding. Sure, Laura, Cherie and the Queen are admirable throwbacks to an earlier era. But let's not waste too much time confusing the orb, the sceptre and the White House drawing room with the real attributes of power.</p>",

  "<p>Knee-deep in a quagmire which could easily pass for a paddy field, Glen Sanderson is close to tears as he examines a blackened, useless crop, flattened by endless rain, which should have been harvested weeks ago. </p> <p>Next week, at great cost to a struggling family farm, contractors will move in to destroy 25 acres of oil seed rape, driving a near-\u00a312,000 hole into the accounts - and wiping out this year's profit - in the forlorn hope of preparing the land for re-seeding. </p> <p>Nearby 170 acres of wheat, the most valuable crop, is still awaiting the harvester and looking distinctly unhealthy. It, too, could soon become worthless and will have to be destroyed. At this time of year much of the harvest should be gathered in, fed and moderately watered by the Almighty's hand, as Mr Sanderson prepares to plough the fields and scatter more good seeds on the land. </p> <p>Instead, like scores of farmers on the east coast, his 400-acre enterprise on the Northumberland plain could be facing ruin unless the weather relents. \"In 33 years of farming I've never known anything like this,\" laments Mr Sanderson as he examines his diary on the farmhouse table. </p> <p>\"Four half days of harvesting in the last three weeks. We are looking at a very serious situation. It is very hard for my family at the moment. The weather seems stuck in this pattern, the land is completely waterlogged, and there's no light at the end of the tunnel.\" </p> <p>His wife, Nicola, looks on anxiously. \"It's very worrying, yes. If we cannot get the wheat in things will be serious.\" With his nearby grain store empty, and expensive combine harvester and drying equipment idle, Mr Sanderson has to decide on Monday whether to accept or cancel a seed consignment due for planting soon to provide next year's crop - in the knowledge that the land is unfit. </p> <p>\"Do I plant or not?\" he sighs. \"If I don't I'll be bust. I couldn't sustain another year like this without a crop to sell and I am quite sure my farming colleagues could not either. This is a very wobbly business now - a large part of it has been wiped out. I've never known it so out of control.\" </p> <p>Around much of Scotland and the north, and parts of the south, it is a similar story of farmers extending their overdrafts with empty grain stores, combines stuck in waterlogged fields and, in many cases, a low-grade crop to sell for those who've managed to complete the harvest. </p> <p>After bumper prices last year on the back of a sun-drenched August, much of the wheat crop is fetching around \u00a358 a tonne, compared with a high of \u00a3110 in 2003, when cereal production in mainland Europe was ruined by a long drought.</p> <p>With Britain still the third largest wheat producer in Europe, and the country largely self-sufficient in the cereal, Paul Ibbott, the National Farmers' Union's chief arable adviser, says the arable industry is now resting on a knife-edge. </p> <p>\"If you're farming in Northumberland, Durham and Yorkshire, it is really critical,\" he says. \"For hundreds of farmers the oil seed rape crop is useless and there are now serious concerns about wheat.\" </p> <p>Mr Ibbott estimates that barely a third of the main wheat crop has been harvested at a time of year when farmers should be planning the next stage in the cycle. \"This time last year it was all in and, to make matters worse, we have some very poor forecasts for the rest of the month,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It's going to take a long time for fields to dry out and, even if they do, the ground will be so wet that combines will get bogged down. It will be very serious if we get to September without much harvesting; farmers will be facing severe financial problems and there is a serious risk of some going to the wall.\" </p> <p>Already some farmers are considering the unthinkable - ploughing up their wheat crop, and losing tens of thousands, rather than accept a low price. Peter Kendall, who farms 3,300 acres in Bedfordshire with his brother, says storms in July flattened crops, making harvesting difficult. \"People are having to combine parts of fields and leave the rest to dry out,\" he warned. \"This puts an extra strain on businesses. We're not halfway through yet and we need the weather to improve quickly.\" </p> <p>Others are relatively lucky. On his 2,000 Cambridgeshire acres Oliver Walston has managed to harvest most of his wheat - but, unlike last year, it needed drying in expensive machinery after the heavy rains. With a high moisture content, he says, this year's crop is extremely low grade, unsuitable for milling and, crucially, for export. It will probably end up as animal feed. Prices had dropped considerably. </p> <p>\"The quality is terrible,\" he said. \"I know farmers like to whinge but this year they have a reason for doing so. The problem is that they've been whingeing for 30 years and when things really get bad - and they are for some - no one believes them.\"</p>",
  "<p>If a relative of yours has died in armed combat, fighting for their country, it is now possible to check the details on the internet. Of course many people will read that and say it's callous, relatives should be told in person, and they'd be right except in one detail: the deceased, in this instance, are casualties from the Boer war and first and second world wars. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.1837online.com\">1837online.com</a> has added about a million records, all referring to members of the armed forces who fell in these conflicts, so relatives can search, find and note details of where their relative - or, more likely, ancestor - fell. </p> <p>Morbid? Not at all. This facility, which, until recently, would have involved a trip to a public record office here or abroad, is fuelling the colossal interest in genealogy online. And customers are sufficiently engaged to pay for the service, which they won't do for every service on the internet. </p> <p>This raises the questions of what it is that makes genealogy on the net so compelling, why people will part with their money when they expect everything else to be free and whether sellers of other services can learn anything from it. </p> <p>Anthony Adolph, the author of Tracing Your Family History (published by Collins next month), is in no doubt. \"It's because it's all about you, trying to find out about where you come from and where you fit in,\" he says. But it does not capture everyone's enthusiasm in the same way, he admits; there are people who will write the whole thing off as a waste of time, but once the idea has become established in someone's mind it's difficult to shift. </p> <p>\"You can see what's out there immediately,\" says Adolph. \"GenesReunited, for example, has done loads to bring people to the area.\" Adolph does have a bias as resident genealogy expert for the GenesReunited site, but he also has a point. </p> <p>One avid online family tree builder is insurance sales manager Dean Woolf, co-proprietor of the <a href=\"http://www.woolffamily.co.uk\">woolffamily.co.uk</a> site, which is aimed at attracting Woolfs to the door. He sees the web as an excellent way to build contacts because it requires much less effort than time consuming visits to an archive centre. </p> <p>He started by looking for people with the same surname and eventually found a third cousin. They set up a modest reunion for family members who had never met, which is to be followed by a larger event next March. His experiences, though, highlight a possible loophole in the fascination with tracing your roots, whether on the net or elsewhere; someone, somewhere, might be fibbing about who they are, and it can be difficult to spot. </p> <p>\"My grandfather's nephew thought he knew who his father was, but we found documents that proved he'd been born seven years after his 'father' had died in a war,\" says Woolf. This hasn't curbed his enthusiasm, however. \"It's the same in modern life - you can only trust the birth certificate or a DNA test, depending on how far back you're going.\" </p> <p>This, Adolph suggests, highlights the difference between a family tree writer - who is essentially making a list - and someone writing a family history. A similar case involved a child being born to a 'father' who'd been at sea for two years before the child arrived, for example. </p> <p>\"It depends on whether you're going into the records to really find the truth,\" he says. \"If you just accept the birth certificate, you'll get one family tree; if you check harder you might ask why the father was at sea, what he was doing, why he accepted the new child, and you find out more about the people.\" </p> <p>Whether people take the 'birth certificate at face value' route or check further into their family histories, there can be no doubt that the internet is becoming a catalyst in getting people involved. </p> <p>Michelle Barker heads GenesReunited, which began in November 2002 and grew to 1.5 million users within 18 months, without any advertising. \"The internet makes genealogy available to anyone,\" she says. \"Before you might have had retired or wealthy people who could visit a public record office, now you can check things while you're sitting down.\" </p> <p>And, thanks to 1837online and similar companies, there are increasing amounts of public records available from your desktop. Despite the failure of initial attempts to put old census results online, the quality and quantity of original documents available is increasing. </p> <p>Julie Pease, marketing manager for 1837online, confirms that the robustness of most sites like it has improved over the past two years; customer testing is an important element of the business and the range of information is increasing. Pease says there are more plans in the offing, in addition to the war records the company has made available in the last week or so, although she remains tight-lipped as to what they might be. </p> <p>There is a surprising amount of social history in genealogy sites. Pease has noticed that in the company's documents on maritime births and deaths, there appears to have been a tradition to name babies after the ship on which they were born - so if you were born on a ship called the Britannic and your name was Robert Brown, you'd have been recorded as Robert Britannic Brown. </p> <p>She was also interested in tracing the records of the victims of the Titanic in the same maritime records, and was surprised to find there were none: \"I thought, what's wrong with these records? But it turned out that it was the captain's duty to record births and deaths on board, so when the captain went down with the ship there was nobody charged with keeping records.\" Surprisingly this ruling held sway until the 1970s. </p> <p>Although many participants concede that genealogy on the internet is not an exact science - to be positive that your family tree is accurate you'd have to be utterly certain of the sexual fidelity of entire generations of people you can never have met - it's an appealing way of placing yourself in a historical context, and also finding other family members who are doing the same. </p> <p>Adolph confirms that he's known people to double the size of their family trees overnight, simply by finding an unknown relative who is working in parallel. \"It's quite gripping once you start,\" he says. And once you hear of a few success stories - including the GenesReunited customer who understandably refuses to be named but who found that he was due a large inheritance of which he would have been unaware if not for the site - it's difficult to imagine it going away.</p>",
  "<p>In <strong>Storyville: Control Room</strong> (BBC2, Saturday), director Jehane Noujaim told the story of Arab TV news channel al-Jazeera and its coverage of the Iraq war. Shrewdly, she gave a wide berth to polemicism and self-righteousness, and merely let the camera observe unblinkingly. Still, she must have loved Donald Rumsfeld's outburst against al-Jazeera's supposed pro-Saddam bias. \"Ultimately people are caught lying and they lose their credibility,\" foamed Donald. Take it from a guy who knows. </p> <p>Ironies such as this became the message of the film's slightly diffuse 85 minutes. There isn't any such thing as objective news coverage, either because networks can only show the material they can gain access to, or because their owners dictate their agenda, or because they tailor their coverage to suit their audience. Al-Jazeera reported the war to an Arab audience naturally somewhat tense about the conflagration erupting in its own back yard, and aired a lot of material that western networks didn't have the bottle to go near. Which didn't mean it was all propaganda - al-Jazeera has been banned by several Arab governments who dislike criticism as much as the White House or Downing Street. </p> <p>It became clear that the title referred to two control rooms. One was the al-Jazeera nerve centre in beautiful downtown Doha, in Qatar, the other was the US military's Central Command 20 miles away (or CentCom, in military geek-speak). CentCom wanted the world's media to toe the US party line of \"WMD, evil Saddam, we bring freedom to the people of Iraq\", but the ungrateful newspersons responded by asking awkward questions and failing to suspend their disbelief. \"Democratise or we'll shoot you,\" as al-Jazeera's Hassan Ibrahim summed up America's generous offer. But one of the most surprising aspects of the film was the scepticism it revealed among American reporters about the US's handling of the war. \"Seems like there's an effort to manage the news in an unmanageable situation,\" murmured CNN's Tom Mintier. </p> <p>Even the US Army's press spokesman, Lieutenant Josh Rushing, seemed to undergo a voyage of enlightenment from unquestioning adherence to the military line to a wider understanding of the complexity of the issues. He certainly seemed to have got the message that the more you try to browbeat the media, the more they'll gang up and try to infiltrate your defences. Set alongside the other US military spokesmen, with their crewcuts, glazed eyes and speaking voices that made Stephen Hawking sound like Graham Norton, Rushing began to look like a dangerous closet revolutionary. </p> <p>You probably think you already know <strong>Who Killed Thomas Becket?</strong> (Channel 4, Sunday). It was those four knights who entered Canterbury cathedral in 1170, and hacked the controversial archbishop to death with their broadswords. This, you will recall, was after King Henry II had uttered his famous line, \"will no one rid me of this troublesome priest?\" </p> <p>Well, yes and no. Henry never said those exact words, according to Andrew Chater's watchable and elegantly shot reconstruction, while the four knights were part of a much larger force which kept Becket cordoned inside his cathedral at the behest of a shadowy figure called Ranulph de Broc, who revelled in the role of Marshal of the King's Whores. No, not Horse. </p> <p>Chater's information may all have been yawningly familiar to medieval historians, but even 800-odd years later the Becket saga embodies such an enthralling clash of church, state and powerful personalities that I found myself pinned to the sofa. The story's brutal lesson in realpolitik echoes instructively down the centuries, and not even such day-glo tabloidese commentary as \"it was the most sensational murder the medieval world had ever known\" could kill it. Henry, having been bosom-buddies with Becket and having elevated him to chancellor, had a reasonable expectation that he might be willing to indulge in a bit of give-and-take when he made him Archbishop of Canterbury. Instead, Becket went native and became so devout that he alienated not only the king but all the other English bishops too. Great story. About time they remade the movie. </p> <p>It was a shame <strong>Atlantic Britain</strong> (Channel 4, Saturday) only lasted half an hour, because this first part of Adam Nicolson's series about navigating a 42ft wooden yacht around Britain's western coastline was full of epic seascapes, sublime locations and suprising facts. For instance, Lundy island is bristling with unique flora and fauna. And the biggest boat Nicolson had previously sailed was a dinghy. Daft bugger.</p>",
  "<p>Fears were mounting last night for the safety of three western journalists who have disappeared in Iraq on the road between Baghdad and Najaf, where fierce fighting between US forces and Shia militiamen continued yesterday. </p> <p>Two French journalists, George Malbrunot of Le Figaro and Christian Chesnot of Radio France International, have not been heard of since Thursday, the French foreign ministry said. A third reporter, Italian Enzo Baldoni, has also vanished. The body of his driver was found at the weekend in Najaf, raising fears that he has been kidnapped. </p> <p>All three journalists had been staying in the same hotel in Baghdad, and were travelling to Najaf to cover the standoff between the US military and the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. </p> <p>Yesterday intense fighting continued around Najaf's Imam Ali shrine, where Mr Sadr's Shia militia, the Mahdi army, have resisted more than two weeks of ferocious American bombardment. </p> <p>Late last night, US warplanes and helicopters attacked positions in the Old City for the second night running with bombs and gunfire, witnesses said. Militant leaders said the shrine compound's outer walls were damaged in the attacks. </p> <p>The US military said it had fired on sites south of the shrine, from which militants were shooting, and did not hit the compound wall, the Associated Press reported. </p> <p>Diplomatic attempts to re solve the crisis have so far failed. </p> <p>At the weekend Mr Sadr's aides said they intended to hand the keys of the shrine to Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most respected Shia cleric, who is currently in London. But Mr Sistani's representatives in Najaf have so far refused to accept them. </p> <p>On Saturday Sheikh Azhar al-Kenani, one of Mr Sadr's senior officials, admitted that even if Mr Sistani did accept the keys, in a symbolic transfer of responsibility for the shrine, the standoff would probably continue. </p> <p>\"We don't want people to get killed. But we can't hand the key to the interim government because they are illegitimate,\" he said. </p> <p>Asked what would happen if US or Iraqi government troops tried to storm the shrine, he replied: \"One hundred per cent there will be a massacre.\" </p> <p>There was also fierce fighting at the weekend in the neighbouring town of Kufa, which is under the control of the Mahdi army. US tanks and armoured vehicles raided the town on Saturday. </p> <p>Mahdi army fighters claim they repulsed the raid and showed off a bloodstained American boot. </p> <p>Yesterday Iraq's interior ministry said 40 of Mr Sadr's fighters had been killed in the town. The figure was being treated cautiously. </p> <p>Yesterday Mahdi army fighters in Kufa said only one comrade had been killed. </p> <p>\"We burned two of their tanks. We're all fine. We will carry on fighting until we are martyred,\" said Sayed Ali, 21. </p> <p>Elsewhere in Iraq, a car bomb exploded yesterday in the town of Khalis, north of Baghdad, killing two people and injuring 14. </p> <p>South of the capital two policemen died after insurgents sprayed their vehicle with gunfire. And in the southern city of Basra, the body of an Iraqi intelligence officer kidnapped nearly a week ago turned up riddled with bullets. His kidnappers had said they would execute him if American and Iraqi government forces did not pull out of Najaf. </p> <p>The latest kidnappings of western journalists temporarily brought the number of reporters missing to four, but a French-American journalist, Micah Garen, who was kidnapped in Iraq more than a week ago, was released yesterday in the southern city of Nas siriya. All four reporters had been staying in the Duleimi, a budget hotel in Baghdad. </p> <p>The road between Baghdad and Najaf is notoriously treacherous, especially around Mahmudiya, a Sunni area south of Baghdad and the scene of numerous attacks on US forces. Two Polish journalists were shot dead there this year. </p> <p>Malbrunot and Chesnot are experienced reporters who had been in Baghdad for a year, and had jointly published a book on Iraq. </p> <p>The French foreign ministry said on Saturday that its embassy in Baghdad had been \"completely mobilised\" but no trace of the two reporters had been found.</p>",
  "<p>The Barclay brothers have poached a new chief executive for the Telegraph group from rival Associated Newspapers in a move that casts doubt on the future involvement of Andrew Neil, the Barclays' chief editorial adviser. </p> <p>In their first important decision since buying the Telegraph last month, the Barclays have poached Murdoch MacLennan to become chief executive of the group, which includes the Sunday Telegraph and the Spectator magazine. </p> <p>Sources close to the billionaire investors said yesterday they had not ruled out giving Mr Neil, a former Sunday Times editor who runs the Barclays' other newspaper ventures in Britain, a senior role at the Telegraph. </p> <p>Mr Neil is understood to have wanted a role that combined the chief executive and chief editorial role. A job as editor-in-chief would not be enough to tempt him to give up his role as a political presenter at the BBC. </p> <p>Sources close to both sides said he could still have \"some informal involvement\" in the papers. </p> <p>Mr MacLennan, 54, has been group managing director of the Daily Mail group since 1994. He is understood to be on friendly terms with Mr Neil. </p> <p>If the Barclays appoint an editor-in-chief, the management structure would echo that at Associated, where Mr MacLennan sat between Viscount Rothermere as chairman and Paul Dacre as editor-in-chief. </p> <p>Aidan Barclay, the son of Sir David Barclay, is chairman of the Telegraph group. </p> <p>Mr MacLennan, who began his career as a graduate trainee at Thomson Regional Newspapers, informed the Rothermeres of his decision to resign by telephone on Friday after the news was leaked. </p> <p>He is understood to have been keen for the Rothermeres to bid for the Telegraph group. If the group had beaten the Barclays Mr MacLennan would have kept the broadsheet's large format. </p> <p>The Scottish-born executive is considered a \"safe pair of hands\" who has \"been around the block a bit\" by Telegraph insiders. </p> <p>More importantly, he has a strong track record in production. He joined Associated in 1989 as managing director of the company's London print operation. </p> <p>Such a background will be useful for the Telegraph in its forthcoming battle with Richard Desmond, owner of the Express. Mr Desmond is expected to exercise his right to buy the remaining 50% of the WestFerry print operations owned by the Telegraph. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Telegraph paid Len Sanderson, former managing director of sales, a lump sum payment of \u00a3664,000 on top of his \u00a3307,000 annual salary last year, it emerged yesterday. Mr Sanderson left after a management reshuffle last October. </p> <p>The payment meant that Mr Sanderson was the Telegraph's top-paid executive last year, receiving more than Jeremy Deedes, the chief executive who returned from retirement earlier this year to lead the Telegraph's sale.</p>",
  "It is the classic law of empires throughout history - over-stretch your forces overseas and the homeland goes to hell in a handcart. So while our gallant Olympians were going for gold in Athens, the nation's press played Cassandra back in Britain. <p>The Sunday Telegraph alerted its readers to a tax bombshell devised to decimate the middle-class. The Times led on the threat posed by a Russian tycoon with designs on Everton football club. The Sunday Express's headline (\"Police told: take the bus\") sounded alarm bells over a lack of 999 cars, while the Independent on Sunday spotlighted a burgeoning crisis as Britain's students forsake science for the arts. Should all these prophecies come to pass, we shall soon be a nation of effete poet types, ruled over by Russian bears, with nobody to call when thieves steal our SUV, which we probably couldn't afford anyway.</p> <p>But while the Sunday papers seemed to be split on precisely which of these evils posed the greatest threat, they were at least united over the nation's belated Olympic heroics (four gold medals in one day). Virtually every front page found itself graced with a picture of a tearful Matthew Pinsent, following his team's hair's-breadth victory in the coxless fours. Inside lay reams of adulatory coverage for Britain's triumphs in such rarefied pursuits as rowing, equestrianism, cycling and \"yngling\". </p> <p>For the sportswriters it evoked a rose-tinted, bygone era when the nation's athletes were hearty, public school gentlemen as opposed to mouthy oiks with too much cash and a council-estate sensibility. \"Olympic gold has come in a rush on the rowing lake, in the light airs of the Saronic gulf and on the cycling track,\" wrote James Lawton in the Sindy. \"Here we saw the best of British passion and character and an overwhelming sense that the highest level of sport doesn't have to be about cheating, grotesque wealth and hopelessly overworked celebrity.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, the press hastened to plug the gaps left by the summer recess, silly season and the unresolved standoff in Najaf (the latest open-ended instalment in an ongoing open-ended saga). At the Mail on Sunday, Molly Watson subjected herself to a five-day diet of daytime television for the sole purpose of writing an article about it. \"Who watches this stuff?\" she wonders at one stage, as if she didn't know. Pensioners, the unemployed, and newspaper reporters stuck for a story.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the big celebrity interview over at the Observer featured one journalist (Lynn Barber) having lunch with another (Julie Burchill). The standfirst gamely attempted to lure us in: \"When two of Britain's most irascible journalists get together, you can be sure there will be tears. But guess which one them ends up crying.\" Sad to say, the suspense is blown in the very first paragraph (it is Burchill who's crying. Moreover, she is crying before the interview even gets underway).</p> <p>For the tabloids, summer provided the perfect excuse to show bleary pictures of Kate Moss clambering over rocks in her bikini, or Hugh Grant grappling with Jemima Khan on a beach in the south of France. The News of the World led with a story on the \"cocaine shame\" of John Thomson, buttressed by an interview in which the Cold Feet star vows that he will \"never touch it again\". For a brief instant I assumed that the Sunday Mirror's front page headline - \"Roo in a vice den\" - must be referring to the chaos caused by an Australian marsupial running amok in an outback brothel. No such luck. The Roo in question turns out to be Everton's Wayne Rooney, who appears to be taking the Gazza route from national hero to national joke in the wake of his Euro 2004 heroics. But so fuzzy is the accompanying photo that it could realistically be anyone - man, beast or plant.</p> <p>It's not long since the American actor Christian Slater was himself a favourite of the scandal sheets. Now he's cleaned up his act and re-launched his career, playing the Jack Nicholson part in a stage production of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest at the Edinburgh festival. In so doing, he seems to have left his wild antics behind. \"Slater is accomplished but muted,\" writes Susannah Clapp in the Observer. \"He plays his firecracker free spirit as if he were a troublesome, perpetual adolescent: naughty, a bit rude, but finally likeable. What he lacks is danger. And that's what's wrong with the entire production: it's amusing but far too mild.\"</p> <p>There was similar qualified applause for the week's big film. M. Night Shyamalan's period horror film The Village arrives in Britain after a howl of negative reviews in the States. Over here, the reviews have been kinder. For the Sunday Express's Henry Fitzherbert, Shyamalan's tale of the monsters threatening a remote woodland community is \"the director's most mature and satisfying work so far\". Jenny McCartney (the Sunday Telegraph) wrote that \"it veers elegantly away from the soggy genre of schlock-horror to return to the elemental things that frighten us: woods, blindness, ditches, howls.\" At the Sindy, Jonathan Romney argued that \"the whole film is a bizarre combination of contemporary pulp horror and 19th-century literary Americana: it's like watching Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Blair Witch Project or reading Stephen King's Walden.\" </p> <p>Back on the news pages, attention was focused on cleaning up another village. A week after it was virtually swept away by floodwater, Boscastle continues to bask in the media spotlight. But with the immediate crisis over, reportage has given way to contemplation. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Howard Jacobson waxed lyrical about a childhood spent in a village that was always prey to the elements. \"This is no serene picture-postcard hamlet whose pleasant disposition happened to be disrupted one innocent August afternoon by forces of nature it had never dreamed of,\" he wrote. \"Boscastle is a harsh, weather-beaten village, cradled in hardship and superstition... Catastrophe is what Boscastle does.\"</p> <p>Judged purely on editorial terms, one can't help feeling that Boscastle has become the perfect summer story. For a start it has provided a treasure trove of eye-catching, apocalyptic imagery not seen since The Day After Tomorrow. Best of all the human cost appears to have been non-existent, which has enabled excited journalists to wade happily through the mud without being labelled vultures or ghouls by the locals. </p> <p>For the Observer's Euan Ferguson, Boscastle is \"a peculiarly British disaster. A strangely perfect disaster. Crucially, no one died ... Perfect strangers became perfect friends overnight. The (future) king visited and vowed to open the court coffers. D-Day was evoked. And Dunkirk. And Dad's Army. And for once this year our armed forces weren't dying horribly, shot in the back in the desert.

  "<p>In the scramble for students, nothing works better than a unique selling proposition. Which is why places for the BA in children's illustration and publishing at North Wales School of Art at the North East Wales Institute of Higher Education (Newi) in Wrexham are at a premium.</p> <p>The course is the only one of its kind in Britain and has developed an international reputation for turning out successful illustrators, many of them on a fast track to publishing deals. </p> <p>Kate Leake, who graduated this year, has just secured a two-book deal with children\u00bfs publisher Macmillan. Spanish student Beatriz Dapena Testa, who is studying for a BA in illustration, the parent course, scooped a major prize for innovation in illustration at the new designers exhibition in London this year, and former student Lucy Richards, who won a coveted Hallmark prize in 2001, was recently commissioned by Egmont Press to illustrate the latest book by the children\u00bfs laureate, Michael Morpurgo. </p> <p>The BA in children's publishing, now in its fifth year, was designed by Yadzia Williams, Sue Thornton and Desdemona McCannon as an extension of the general illustration course to cater for students who were specifically interested in children\u00bfs publishing. Places are limited to about 25 a year, and apart from meeting the usual Newi admission criteria, applicants are also expected to have some background knowledge of the field and a love of books. </p> <p>McCannon, the programme leader, attributes the success of the course to two main factors, the first of which is its emphasis on traditional skills. \"It may sound as if I am stating the obvious, but we do place a major emphasis on drawing, something publishers tell us is disappearing from art schools.\" The second factor is that the course was developed in close consultation with publishing houses and art directors, whose input is vital in helping students to focus on the needs of the market. </p> <p>\"It took nearly two years to research the content with the publishing industry and with British illustrators, but it was time well spent,\" McCannon says. The college continues to consolidate its industry links, and recently representatives from Walker Books, Random House and Little Tiger Press have expressed an interest in helping with aspects of course development. </p> <p>North Wales may not be thought of as the cultural centre of the universe, but it is proving to be the perfect starting point for students who are keen to develop a global perspective on the industry. \"National and international trips are an important part of the student experience,\" explains McCannon. \"This year we are organising a trip to the Salon Livre Presse Jeunesse in Paris. French children's books are beautiful, like art books.\" For students on the children\u00bfs illustration and publishing BA there are regular opportunities to keep abreast of the international publishing scene, with visits to the London children's books seminars, the Paris and Bologna book fairs, and a graphics trip to New York. It's putting the North Wales School of Art on the international map. During 2004, the course intake included students from Finland, Korea and Germany, and there are enquiries for places from as far afield as the US and China. </p> <p>This strong vocational element is complemented by visits to London publishing houses and guest lectures from top children's illustrators, art directors and authors. The school of art also takes an exhibition stand at the annual new designers show in Islington, which often leads directly to publishing work for illustration students. The illustration course links up with other courses at Newi, including a module on writing for children. \"The creative writing strand is very important to us, because we want students who have the potential to write and illustrate,\" explains McCannon.</p> <p>Illustrators are also encouraged to test market ideas on librarians and schoolteachers through regular seminar and \"book group\" type sessions, which often reveal what works and why. In addition, students learn to present both themselves and their work, and receive professional guidance on websites and how to package their work for publishers. </p> <p>The children's illustration team is now busy working on its latest project, an MA in character and narrative design for multimedia, games, animation and comics, which will focus on visual storytelling in a multidisciplinary context.<br></p> <p><strong>Case study</strong><br></p> <p>Anita Kapila, 22, is studying media and communications at the University of Central England, Birmingham<br></p> <p>\"Initially I was looking for an arts-based media course, but I couldn't find what I wanted and I went to the Royal College of Fashion for a year. I started working in fashion, but soon realised it wasn't what I wanted to do.</p> <p>I decided to do a media course because I'd really enjoyed it at A-level. I wasn't too keen on the idea of Birmingham at first, but I went to an open day at UCE and everyone was so friendly that I decided to apply.</p> <p>During the first year I realised I didn't want to go into production because I'm not very good on the technical side of things. That was a bit of a surprise because it was the area I thought I'd most enjoy. I decided to specialise in culture and society. We looked at advertising, visual culture, photography, and the theory behind why we watch what we watch, why things are represented in certain ways and what consequences they have. I still carried on with some production: presenting, broadcast journalism and writing for print.</p> <p>The social life has been the best thing about my degree. The first year was a non-stop party: we only needed to get 40% to get through to the second year. I wanted to make the most of it and had an amazing time.</p> <p>I started to get more serious about my work in the second year, but I still managed to enjoy myself. This last year has been a complete nightmare: stress all day, every day. I felt guilty when I was eating or watching television. </p> <p>Ideally I want to do something that combines media and fashion, but for now I just want to chill for a while, get back on my feet and see what's out there.\"<br> <strong>Interview by Katie Shimmon</strong></p>",
  "<p>Britain's Leslie Law, elevated to individual gold medallist in the three-day event, says he will apologise to the German, Bettina Hoy, whom he displaced when she lost both individual and team titles on appeal. </p> <p>\"It feels pretty good actually, very exciting,\" Law said. \"But I know Bettina quite well and I'm sure she's going to be extremely disappointed.\" </p> <p>Law, 39, sees Hoy frequently on the eventing circuit and he says their next meeting will be difficult. \"I will say I'm sorry, it's as much as I can do.\" </p> <p>Hoy had initially received 12 time penalties for crossing the starting line twice during the showjumping phase but that decision was overturned and Hoy, and Germany, went on to receive the individual and team titles. </p> <p>However, on Saturday Law was elevated from silver to gold medallist when the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld an appeal by France, Britain and the United States. </p> <p>His team-mate Pippa Funnell now collects an individual bronze and the British team, which also included William Fox-Pitt, Mary King and Jeanette Brakewell, move up to silver. </p> <p>Law, who rode Shear L'Eau to the gold, revealed he had once made the same mistake as Hoy. \"It was about eight years ago in France and I collected penalties for it. I know exactly what it feels like but just not at such a high level.\" </p> <p>The British showjumper, Nick Skelton, who once feared he would not ride again, hopes he can deliver a second equestrian gold. </p> <p>He suffered a serious neck injury days before Sydney 2000 and spent months in hospital. However, a superb clear round on Arko III, with only one time fault, left him well placed after the first phase of showjumping qualifying. He was 11th overall but within touching distance of the leaders. Robert Smith and Mr Springfield incurred four faults, leaving them 19th.</p>",
  "President George Bush stood accused of appropriating the Olympic movement for political means last night, amid reports he was planning to visit Athens later this week to watch some sporting events, including a potential gold-medal winning bid by the Iraqi football team. <p>According to unconfirmed reports in the US, the White House is examining the logistical and security implications of Mr Bush travelling to the Greek capital in time for Saturday's football final. Iraq, whose progress to the semi-finals of the tournament has been one of the games' most captivating stories, will meet Paraguay tomorrow night for a possible place in the finals. </p> <p>The Greek foreign ministry confirmed last night that the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, will be in Athens for the closing ceremony. </p> <p>But it is the potential presidential visit to the games that will fuel a dispute between the election campaign of Mr Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, and the US Olympic Committee over an advert which links Iraq's and Afghanistan's participation in the games with the US administration's \"war on terror\". </p> <p>The advert, which has been broadcast in the US for the past week, begins with footage from the 1972 Olympic games in Munich, during which 13 Israeli athletes were killed by terrorists, and continues with a narrator saying: \"Freedom is spreading through the world like a sunrise. And this Olympics there will be two more free nations and two less terrorist regimes.\" </p> <p>As the flags of Afghanistan and Iraq flutter in the breeze, it concludes: \"With strength, resolve and courage, democracy will triumph over terror and hope will defeat hatred.\" </p> <p>Under American copyright law, only the US Olympic Com mittee has the right to use the Olympic insignia, images and trademarks for marketing purposes. </p> <p>Initially, the committee reportedly called for the advert to be withdrawn, but its spokesman retreated from that last night. </p> <p>\"We have contacted the president's election campaign team and asked them to forward us a copy of the advert. Once we have reviewed it and determined the type and extent of the use of the Olympic name, we will decide how to progress,\" a spokesman, Darryl Seibel, said. </p> <p>The committee might want to avoid a confrontation with Mr Bush, but it appears that the objects of his affections have no such qualms. </p> <p>To the embarrassment of their media handlers in Athens, members of the Iraqi football team have reacted furiously to the news that their efforts are being used to aid Mr Bush's efforts to win a second term in the White House. </p> <p>The team's coach, Adnan Hamd, told Sports Illustrated magazine: \"My problem is not with the American people. They are with what America has done; destroyed everything. The American army has killed so many people in Iraq. What is freedom when I go to the stadium and there are shootings on the road?\" </p> <p>One of the team's midfield players, Ahmad Manajid, accused Mr Bush of \"slaughtering\" Iraqi men and women. \"How will he meet his God having slaughtered so many? I want to defend my home. If a stranger invades America and the people resist, does that make them a terrorist?\" he said. </p> <p>Mark Clark, the spokesman for the Iraqi Olympic squad in Athens, accused journalists of taking advantage of the players. \"They are not very sophisticated politically. Whoever posed these questions knew the answers would be negative. It is possible something was lost in translation. The players are entitled to their opinions but we are disappointed,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Bush, not hitherto known as a keen football fan, has made repeated references to the performances of the Iraqi football team in his campaign speeches. </p> <p>After its unexpected 4-2 victory over Portugal, he told a crowd in Oregon that the fact the team was in Athens was fantastic, adding: \"It wouldn't have been free if the United States hadn't acted.\"</p>",
  "<p>Not since Nelson has Britain had a maritime hero as dashing as Ben Ainslie, though Horatio never refused to go off to the Battle of Copenhagen unless he had had a few spring rolls and a portion of kung-po chicken. </p> <p>\"A Chinese meal before the first race - it's just one of my superstitions. I seem to have a lot of superstitions these days,\" Ainslie said yesterday when asked about his preparations for the Olympic regatta. </p> <p>Ainslie may be suspicious but he is also modest, which is no doubt why he chose to attribute his gold medal in Athens - to add to his gold from Sydney and his silver in Atlanta - to forces beyond his control. </p> <p>He forgot to the mention his own commitment to the sport: the 27-year-old, who had previously been victorious in the Laser class, put on 35lb in order to sail in the heavier Finn boats. There was also his determination, all too evident as he pulled himself back from a disastrous opening two races to win four of the next six. </p> <p>And above all, of course, was his tactical brilliance. This was amply on display during the last race of the 11 in the series. Ainslie needed to finish within 14 places of his nearest rival, Spain's Rafael Trujillo, to win the gold. He did so with ease, tracking his rival the entire way round the Olympic course to finish only one place back. </p> <p>He even found time at the finish line to apologise to Trujillo, who was involved in a tight struggle with the Polish boat for the silver medal. \"I told Rafael I was sorry if I'd slowed him down by tracking him so closely, but he understood the tactics perfectly well.\" </p> <p>Polite, too. Is there no end to Ainslie's attributes? \"No,\" said Shirley Robertson, one of the 18 British sailors in Athens, a team threatening to go down as one of the best in Olympic history. \"We all think of Ben as superhuman.\" </p> <p>Robertson is not exactly deficient herself when it comes to sailing powers, having skippered the British boat to gold in the Yngling class with one race to spare, adding to her Europe-class victory in Sydney. The Yngling success had set the British haul rolling in the sailing events in Athens - two golds and one silver. </p> <p>The team suffered a setback yesterday, though, when Paul Goodison slipped out of the bronze medal spot in the final race of the Laser class but there are more strong medal chances to come this week: Iain Percy and Steve Mitchell in the Star class, the crew in the 49er class skippered by Chris Draper, and Leigh McMillan in the Tornado. </p> <p>Britain's medal winners from week one were loath to make predictions about their colleagues' prospects, just as they laughed when asked to consider their own places in the Olympic sailing pantheon. Despite the sport's rather lofty public image, it comes as a relief to discover that the British team is a grounded, earthy lot - characteristics that define Joe Glanfield, who was once enrolled in the FA's School of Excellence, and his crew-mate Nick Rogers, who was sporting a bump on his head sustained during a long night celebrating the pair's silver medal in the 470 class. If there were silver spoons in either man's family, they were melted down long ago to help pay for sailing lessons and equipment. </p> <p>Although there was no chorus of We Are The Champions, there was a willingness to address the irrefutable assertion that Britain is now the pre-eminent competition sailing nation in the world. Asked for an explanation for this excellence, the team members, to a man and woman, cited lottery funding which amounted to \u00a31.75m last year. </p> <p>However, unlike other nations, which hand out wads of cash and tell them to get on it, the money spent on British sailing is carefully allocated by the Royal Yachting Association. It has been used for living expenses - Rogers and Glanfield each received \u00a38,000 last year - on equipment, on coaching and on preparation. </p> <p>For instance, members of the British team have been coming to Athens each August for the past three years in order to get used to the condi tions they would face at the Olympics. \"We are brilliantly organised. Nothing is left to chance,\" said Ainslie. \"With all of that in place, it is then left up to us sailors to go out on the water and get results.\" </p> <p>Needless to say, there are factors at play besides money - team spirit, experience, even a great cook who travels with the team to regattas. But it took one of Ainslie's colleagues to highlight perhaps the single biggest reason behind Britain's success in Athens. \"When you look at Ben and what he has achieved,\" said Rogers, \"it just makes you realise that anything is possible.\"</p>",
  "<p>The BBC, for all its sterling attempts to encourage audience participation from the sofa during these Olympics, has surely made one glaring omission to its ever broadening range of interactive services. Why on earth, when Sue Barker offers up the options of what to do with the red button on our remote control, is there not one that enables us to switch off the inane post-race interviews conducted by the likes of Sharron Davies and Sally Gunnell? </p> <p>It is the immediacy of interrogation that makes these encounters so uncomfortable to watch. Whether elated or crushed by their performance, the reality is that in the seconds following it, an athlete remains too bereft of oxygen to be able to put things into perspective. In short, they have nothing meaningful to say in that instant before they gather their thoughts. </p> <p>Back at home, we are left recoiling behind a cushion as we are forced to invade what should be the privacy of their raw emotion. A dream consummated or shattered surely deserves at least a few moments of quiet reflection before it is dissected in front of the nation. Not, it seems, in the eyes of the BBC. </p> <p>Which is why we had Davies setting the tone of things to come last week at the aquatics centre. True, she looked resplendent as she draped herself over hoardings by the side of the pool, seductively gesturing with a French-manicured fingernail to our swimmers (most of whom, incidentally, appeared to be wearing considerably more than her) the minute they finished a race. </p> <p>But by day two her formulaic technique had become predictable to the point that you found yourself wincing even before she began her searching inquiries of \"So, how disappointing was that then?\" or \"How are you feeling after that?\" \"Knackered,\" we urged them to say before stomping off. But that would not have satisfied Sharron. And so the torture was prolonged. </p> <p>Now the baton of a BBC microphone has been passed to Gunnell, who hovers trackside in the mixed zone enthusiastically waiting to intercept anyone in a British vest. Gunnell, of course, is an accomplished veteran of microphone-thrusting. Many, wise to her tactics, now skirt to avoid her. Kelly Holmes, for instance, has extended her races by several metres this summer and tends to sprint straight past Gunnell and out of the stadium. Others in track and field give a nonchalant shrug of the shoulders to her suggestions that they have under-achieved, and use the opportunity to say hello to their sister in New Zealand who has just had a baby. </p> <p>To be fair to Davies, Gunnell and the others in their position, they are doubtless carrying out instructions to the letter in order to keep their job. But the point of that job is what, exactly? Can there really be any virtue in exposing an athlete at a time when their guard is so blatantly down? </p> <p>Such is the blandness of response that nothing insightful is ever in danger of being revealed. In fact, what is fast becoming an obligatory practice across televised sport appears to offer little beyond satisfying a producer's desire for his charges to get in there with an interview before anyone else has the chance. </p> <p>The ambush tactic is creeping in everywhere like some sort of televisual virus. At Wimbledon this summer, any player leaving centre court was hijacked for comment en route to the dressing room. Football managers are accosted as they prepare to bolt for the tunnel at half-time. And to what end? Do interviewers seriously believe that tactics for the second half are going to be divulged on camera? That a manager has nothing better to do with his mid-match minutes than to stop and discuss the game with a TV crew? </p> <p>In Athens, though, this latest form of emotional voyeurism has reached new ground. There appears to be no stopping the 20 dim questions that follow a British performance. Athletes must surely dread the prospect even more than they fear lining up against the best in the world. Perhaps someone should suggest they text or email their opinions on the matter to Sue Barker or Steve Cram.</p>",
  "<p>Statisticians almost doubled their estimate of real price government spending growth in the year to the first quarter in their last set of numbers. </p> <p>It went from just under 3% to nearly 6%. It's not that the government was spending any more in cash or current price terms than they previously thought, but that, after going through the numbers again and adding them up in a more complicated way, they decided the same cash amount was going further in real terms. </p> <p>As citizens and taxpayers, we should be pleased. We're getting more output from government and better value for money. </p> <p>The old numbers did look a bit odd. As economists, however, we can't help but find a problem in any news. The revisions raised the level of real government spending in the first quarter by 5% or more. </p> <p>The relevant measure of spending makes up about a fifth of the economy, so the revision in effect raised the level of output across the economy as a whole by 1%. What could be wrong with that? </p> <p>The problem is that if the revisions have raised actual output, and there's been no change in potential or trend output, the economy is working harder and the output gap - the difference between the two - is likely to move in the direction of more capacity pressure. </p> <p>That, in turn, would normally be expected to have implications for monetary policy. For example, a 1% reduction in the output gap might be associated with a rise in rates of up to 100 basis points on the basis of the sort of coefficients often found in simple policy rules. </p> <p>The point has not been lost on the authorities. The minutes of last month's monetary policy committee meeting note that the level of output had been revised up by roughly 1% and that the change was more than explained by the revisions to real government spending. </p> <p>They are on the case. We also know that the committee is concerned about capacity pres sures and yet the revisions seem to have coincided with it becoming more, rather than less, relaxed about where rates might need to go. </p> <p>It has provided an explanation. The general point is that it assesses capacity pressures using a range of indicators and not just simple estimates of the output gap. </p> <p>The more specific point is that, in this particular context, the government's use of inputs may matter more than the measurement of its output. </p> <p>Inflation is a market sector issue and the non-market sector may only matter to the extent that it contributes to capacity pressures in that sector. </p> <p>It may be interesting that it is more productive than we might have thought - and productivity may be a good thing - but, in relation to the job of controlling inflation, the productivity of the non-market sector may not be relevant. </p> <p>It's a view that suggests the labour market, which is where many of these issues are resolved, is a key indicator. </p> <p>If any thing, the recent labour market trends have been less strong - the latest numbers show a small rise in unemployment, for example, on the survey-based series - which fits with the pattern of the committee's recent decisions on rates and with its expectations for consumer spending. </p> <p>Ironically, the revisions may cause more difficulties for the fiscal authorities than they do for the monetary authorities. </p> <p>The higher growth numbers mean that for any improvement in the headline budget deficit the improvement in the cyclically adjusted deficit - which is what matters for the rules - will look smaller. </p> <p>Having said that, if there really is not much spare capacity in the economy, the fiscal authorities would do well to factor that in sooner rather than later. We knew there had to be a problem somewhere! </p> <p>\u00b7 Robert Barrie is head of European economics at CSFB in London</p>",
  "Why is it we find it so difficult to celebrate the success of our young people? The rise in A-level passes for the 22nd year highlights the continued improvements in teaching and the dedication of students to make the most of their education. The government is now looking for a way to distinguish among A grade students between the \"excellent\" and the \"very good\" (As grades rise, how can colleges make choices? August 19). Reforms to the system should not be driven by those who run university admissions seeking to make their lives easier. We should not label some of the more successful students as not good enough so that we can continue to rely on A-levels to sort out our admissions. <p>If an increasing number of students deserve to get grade As, we should celebrate and not bemoan their success. It is not the responsibility of a university to limit education to the benefit of a privileged few. </p> <p>We firmly support the government's target of widening student participation in higher education to 50% by 2010. To achieve this, we not only need to encourage a broader base of student intake, but also offer a broader choice of courses to attract them. A successful education system is not one where the majority fail, but one where the majority thrive and excel.<br><b>Malcolm McVicar</b><br>Vice-chancellor, University of Central Lancashire </p> <p>Dr Wilson tells us that his job as a university admissions tutor is to \"assess who has the potential to flourish during a three-year degree\" (Letters, August 20). Can he tell us how he achieves this, when even the most rigorous assessment methods have been shown to be, at best, weak predictors? Does he have a crystal ball, or does he simply look into their souls? The best indicator of future performance is a valid measure of past achievement. I would rather trust the results of our, albeit imperfect, A-level system than pass control to individuals within universities who are unaccountable for their idiosyncratic decisions.<br><b>George Bethell</b><br>Director, Anglia Assessment </p> <p>Roy Boffy's suggestion (Letters, August 21) is reputedly already in operation in vastly oversubscribed universities in Yorkshire. Applications with certain grades are thrown into a \"hat\" and the number of them withdrawn to fill the places available. Is this necessarily a bad thing? It does not allow for the personal prejudices of the selectors. Do students with interesting, or inventive CVs necessarily make better graduates?<br><b>Diana Brazier</b><br>Leeds </p> <p>You describe psychology and media studies as \"soft\" A-level options as compared with modern languages and physics (Media studies up, sciences down?

It is easy to focus on the excellence of a few, but we must not forget those socially excluded young people who fall outside mainstream education. Our latest statistics show that 23% of the young people we work with have no qualifications; 16% have trouble with writing English and a further 13% with reading. It is vital the government caters for the needs of all young people.<br><b>Balbir Chatrik</b><br>Centrepoint</p>",
  "Over the past 12 months, Gordon Brown and others have had ample opportunity to force Tony Blair out. They could have joined Robin Cook in resigning on the eve of the war in Iraq. They could have moved in May and June when the prime minister seemed on the ropes. They were either unwilling or unable to act. In short, they blew it. They bottled. <p>Blair has survived his ordeal - a botched war, rebellions over public service reform, and half-challenges from his chancellor - and is likely to emerge more confident than he has been for two years. He is back where he was originally, in a position to determine the time and manner of his departure. </p> <p>With Westminster gearing up for the new political season, the question the left must ask itself is: if it cannot replace him, can it influence him? Will Labour MPs go into the next election with a manifesto that bears only a passing resemblance to what many understand as radicalism? Will Blair's eventual successor be locked into pledges in which he has little faith? </p> <p>On one level, there is cause for gloom. And yet Blair is the first to appreciate that, with voters as unpredictable as they are, the election is not in the bag. In order to entice them to turn out, he has to entice his own grassroots to campaign. </p> <p>To do that, a truce has to be called. The terms of engagement have to change. Blair has belatedly to acknowledge some mistakes over Iraq. His critics should then agree, as the boss would say, to \"move on\". This would be an imperfect solution, but better than none. The crucial stage in the healing process is a debate, a serious one, about ideas. This will be hard for a leader who sees his party as a vehicle for action rather than discussion. </p> <p>The national policy forum at the end of July demonstrated again the gap between rhetoric and reality. Blair's speech was entitled \"Winning the Battle of Ideas\". It is a victory by default, because the battle is fought only within extremely tight parameters. Many people simply do not engage. </p> <p>Mainstream critics within the party define themselves by what they are against. Some, like Neal Lawson, whose farewell to Blairism in these columns caused quite a stir, are tentatively putting together an alternative manifesto for social democracy. But whether they are officially sought by Downing Street, which put out an SOS to thinktanks shortly before the policy forum, or whether they come from outside, ideas are still thin on the ground. \"We are in desperate need of inspiration,\" says one minister. </p> <p>Do not hold your breath. Certainly do not look to the party conference, a study in choreography, for signs of compromise. If concessions to the party are made, it will happen behind closed doors. But MPs and ministers I have spoken to over the past few days, those who would fall into the category of loyal but frustrated, argue that if Blair wants to galvanise Labour-inclined voters next year he will have to offer more than the promises of crime crackdowns and a more individualised National Health Service and school system. </p> <p>They point to several areas. Quality of life issues have risen up the scale of priorities. The Blairite solution is typically triangulated. It focuses on increasing nursery places and improving childcare provision, on enhancing maternity and paternity rights, all admirable in themselves, while doing little to threaten the hegemony of the boardroom or to remove the atmosphere of wage slavery. </p> <p>Leaving aside France's 35-hour week (the debate is raging there on its merits), the government - through its obsession with global competitiveness - is failing to keep pace with voters. Blair friend and foe alike have much to do on family and work, as they do on the whole agenda of public service reform. The debate so far has revolved around over-simplified concepts such as \"choice\" and individualisation. </p> <p>As for issues around equity and poverty, there is still an argument to be had on a fairer distribution of income and assets, taking us beyond the somewhat stale debate on income tax rates. The left is in dire need of updating its thinking. </p> <p>There are several other areas where the left could be making the running. On law and order it has to engage on antisocial behaviour - there is little denying its importance to voters - but it need not be along the crime first, causes second lines of Blair and David Blunkett. The same goes for asylum and immigration. It is easy to attack the government for its ugly populist lunges, but where is the contrary prescription that combines fairness for those in need with the welfare and security requirements of voters? </p> <p>And what of the original \"new politics\" agenda of 1997? Blairites embraced the hopes of more open and accountable politics with equal ardour. Progress has been pitifully slow, in some areas non-existent. Fairer voting for Westminster elections is as elusive as ever. House of Lords reform has made little progress. Commons reform has been minimal. Some power may be devolved to regional government. But more importantly, the early emphasis on individual liberty through the incorporation of the human rights convention has been emasculated by excesses such as the detention without trial of the Belmarsh Twelve. Reconciling civil liberties with the threat posed by terrorism is vital for the left. </p> <p>Blair has raised the white flag to the sceptics at the first sign of trouble with the EU. If the constitution and \"social Europe\" are so unthreatening to social democrats abroad, why is a better case not made here? Cook's vow to introduce an ethical dimension to foreign policy was mocked by Blair, who saw no need to curb arms sales or change the government's traditionally selective approach to human rights abuses. </p> <p>This is fertile ground for the left. But on the most burning issue of all, intervention, it has to formulate its own approach. If Blair was wrong on Iraq, is it ever right to send British forces into action? And if so, on what terms? There can be no more important issue for internationalists than that. </p> <p>Blair says with his characteristic disdain that the Labour party has \"given up the luxury of criticism for the obligation of decision\". He is in part right. For criticism to carry weight, it has to be backed by a persuasive alternative vision. Otherwise Labour will have to put up with its current leader and his minimalist vision of the future for some time to come. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Kampfner is political editor of the New Statesman and author of Blair's Wars</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jkampfner.net\">www.jkampfner.net</a></p>",
  "\"A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behaviour, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If at the end of a war story you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie.\" <br> <b>\u00b7 </b>Tim O'Brien, The Things They Carried <p>Vietnam war veteran and Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry has been ambushed and, for the moment, remains caught in enemy fire. Having made his five-month stint of decorated service in Vietnam the heart of his platform, it is now emerging as his achilles heel. </p> <p>A group of veterans financed by Republicans from Texas and close to President George Bush are airing ads calling him a liar for the claims he has made about his service and suggesting that he did not come by his military medals honestly. Their case is shoddy, given that none of the Swift-boat Veterans for Truth were with Kerry at the time and their claims have been refuted by those who were. Their motivation is shabby, as most of them are piqued by the fact that Kerry returned home to campaign against the war. All of which makes the fact that their attacks have had such a huge impact that much more revealing. </p> <p>For since the ads began screening, Kerry's slight lead in the polls has been shaved away. Two weeks ago, before the ads appeared, he was running even with Bush among the nation's 26 million veterans. Now Bush has a 24-point lead. The issue dominating the news cycle is not what is happening in Najaf today but what happened in the Mekong delta 35 years ago. </p> <p>There are three things we can learn from this. First, there is no level to which Republicans will not stoop to besmirch a character, belittle an issue or befuddle the electorate. Second, there is no level to which the Democrats will not stoop to attempt to neutralise these attacks. And third, that the Republicans will always win in this race to the bottom because so much less is expected of them and, when it comes to muck-slinging, they have no qualms about getting their hands dirty. </p> <p>Take Vietnam. At first sight this is an issue you would think the Bush administration would want to keep away from. Thanks to family connections, the president served his war in the Texas National Guard - and even then it is debatable whether he showed up. The vice-president, Dick Cheney, managed to defer being drafted five times, until the war was over, claiming he had \"other priorities\". Nine months and two days after the army changed the regulations so that married men with no children were no longer exempt, Cheney had his first child, Elizabeth, bringing a whole new meaning to the term family planning. </p> <p>Nobody is questioning their record in Vietnam for the simple reason that, unlike Kerry, neither them ever served there. For them to raise Kerry's service is a mixture of chutzpah and desperation that could backfire. Bush has tried to distance himself from the ads, saying they were put out by an independent group. But since the money trail leads back to his friends in Texas, this won't wash. </p> <p>The trouble for Kerry is that, in all likelihood, none of this will matter. The Bush campaign knows the attention span of the public is short and that few will sweat the details. Their hope is that by the time the claims of the Swift-boat Veterans have been discredited, a stubborn question mark will remain hanging over Kerry's military record. If you spread enough dung, goes the logic, then some seeds of doubt will grow. </p> <p>There is nothing new in this. The Bush team employed the same strategy in 2000 against Al Gore, forcing him to refute claims he never made about inventing the internet and being the basis for Love Story. In 2002, Republicans managed to unseat senator Max Cleland of Georgia by branding him unpatriotic because he opposed the creation of the homeland security department. Cleland lost three limbs in Vietnam and is a former head of the Veterans' Administration. </p> <p>But if the method of attack by Republicans is underhand, the issue they have chosen for this attack is understandable. For it was Kerry, not Bush, who placed his military service centre stage in this election campaign. The logic of doing so was clear enough. Clips of Kerry striding through the delta carrying a gun while his band of brothers (those who served with him) offered testimony of his heroics, served as a double whammy. They established Kerry in the public mind as a strong leader in wartime while providing a contrast with Bush, who stayed at home. </p> <p>But by the time of the Democratic convention, the party had elevated his service 35 years ago from one aspect of his personal history to his principle selling point in his campaign for the presidency. Refusing to spell out what plans he had for the future in Iraq or the war on terror, he was forced to exploit this one moment in his past for all it was worth. </p> <p>\"If we do not speak of it others will surely rewrite the script,\" said Vietnam veteran George Swiers shortly after returning. \"Each of the body bags, all of the mass graves will be reopened and their contents abracadabraed into a noble cause.\" </p> <p>And so it was that Kerry referred to his military service alone to qualify him for the presidency. He delivered a string of nationalist non sequiturs: \"As president, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war\"; \"I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as president\"; and \"I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong delta\". </p> <p>Then towards the end he reached for the stars and stripes. \"That flag flew from the turret right behind my head. And it was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men that I served with and friends I grew up with.\" </p> <p>In so doing, Kerry may have neutralised charges that he will be weak on defence. But he also made his war record fair game and set the ground work for one of the most nationalistic elections in living memory: a campaign that offers the choice between a Republican candidate who wants America to be obeyed and a Democrat who wants it to be \"looked up to\" and become \"once again a beacon in the world\". </p> <p>Kerry is not only running for president, but in flight from a history he knows only too well. When he returned from Vietnam he testified before the Senate foreign relations committee that American troops had \"raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to genitals and turned up the power, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians [and] razed villages in fashion reminiscent of Ganghis Khan.\" Just a few reasons why that beacon has burned so dimly for so long, and why Americans deserve a better choice. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The US was yesterday accused by Palestinian leaders of destroying hopes for peace in the Middle East by giving its covert support to Israel's expansion of controversial settlements in the West Bank. <p>American officials are privately admitting they have abandoned their demands that Israel freeze settlement activity, and have given Jerusalem tacit permission to build thousands of new homes on the disputed land. </p> <p>Palestinians fear that the expansion of settlements will make it impossible to establish a viable state on the land Israel took from Jordan in the 1967 war. </p> <p>Ahmed Qureia, the Palestinian prime minister, said the US position would destroy the peace process, and Amr Moussa, secretary general of the Arab League, said America's unilateral redrawing of the road map was \"a very grave development\". </p> <p>Publicly, the US still upholds the road map, which calls for a freeze on all settlement activity, including natural growth. But the administration, partly out of frustration with Yasser Arafat, has adopted a position more sympathetic to Israel. </p> <p>The US has effectively endorsed the Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon's view of the division of the West Bank. Mr Sharon believes Israel should pull out of Gaza and keep the large settlement blocks such as Ariel, Gush Etzion and Ma'ale Adumim. </p> <p>The first indication of a shift in US policy happened in March when President George Bush and Mr Sharon exchanged letters. The Israeli leader said he planned to withdraw from settlements in Gaza and the northern West Bank and Mr Bush replied that the US recognised that the Israeli population centres (the large settlements) in the West Bank would remain Israeli and would not become part of a Palestinian state. </p> <p>Then in a series of meetings between Israeli and US officials, particularly Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, and Dov Weissglas, Mr Sharon's adviser, maps were drawn indicating where construction could take place. </p> <p>The latest sign of a significant move came last week when Israel invited tenders to build more than 1,000 homes in the West Bank. The White House did not criticise the announcement. </p> <p>A western diplomat said yesterday: \"The road map calls for a freeze in all settlement activity. End of story. </p> <p>\"The Israelis have never accepted that and the US has tacitly agreed that their position has validity and has shown that limited building is permissible.\" </p> <p>According to another European diplomat, the change in US policy is a \"huge shift\". </p> <p>\"In these meetings the US has indicated areas where Israel cannot build. Israel has taken that to mean it is permissible to build in other areas. The US is effectively deciding how the West Bank will look in the future. It's a huge shift in policy,\" he added. </p> <p>Jeff Halper, an Israeli political activist who specialises in Israel's control of the Palestinian territories, said: \"Effectively a new road map has been drawn between the US and Israel which the United Nations, the European Union and Russia do not agree with.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the British embassy in Tel Aviv would not comment on the change. \"Our policy is that we support the road map,\" he said. </p> <p>The European diplomat said the EU was \"institutionally annoyed\" at being excluded from discussions, but individual countries had not reacted angrily to the change. </p> <p>The US-Israeli deals once again leave the Palestinians out of the negotiation process. Mr Qureia said he was waiting for confirmation of the shift in US policy, adding that he would be shocked if it were true. \"I can't believe that America is now saying that settlement expansion is alright,\" he said. \"This will destroy the peace process.\" </p> <p>The road map was launched last year and President Bush said he would \"ride herd\" to make sure both parties honoured their commitments. </p> <p>By August the ceasefire had ended, but all parties continued to hold up the road map as the blueprint for peace. Over the last year, Israel has embarked on a large building programme in the West Bank. </p> <p>Peace Now, an Israeli pressure group that monitors the settlements, said a minimum of 3,700 homes were being built in the West Bank. </p> <p>The Israeli housing ministry has invited tenders for another 1,600 homes and infrastructure works are under way for a new settlement that will link Ma'ale Adumim with east Jerusalem. </p> <p>According to the European diplomat, the change in US policy stems from frustration with Mr Arafat and the Palestinians in not reforming the Palestinian Authority and preventing violence. </p> <p>The administration is also furious with the Palestinians for not arresting those responsible for the killing of three American security guards in Gaza earlier this year.</p> <p>The European diplomat said: \"Bush took the position that until the Palestinians get serious about security there was no point in addressing them.\" </p> <p>Israeli officials insist that the construction is all part of prior agreements. </p> <p>Zalman Shoval, a former Israeli ambassador to the US and an adviser to Mr Sharon on foreign affairs, said that the road map was not breached by the West Bank construction, which was in line with previous agreements. </p> <p>\"The new construction also does not negate the road map because our understanding, and also that of the US I think, was that it was performance based. </p> <p>\"Therefore the Israeli commitments would fall into place when the Palestinians stopped terror, which they have not done,\" he said.</p>",
  "The row about John Kerry's war record became more heated yesterday with the resignation of a Bush campaign adviser on veterans' affairs and the publication of a personal account of the events that led to Senator Kerry being awarded a Silver Star. <p>Ken Cordier, a former Vietnam PoW, resigned from the Bush campaign after it emerged that he had appeared in a commercial made by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, the group that has led the attacks. </p> <p>It gave further credence to suggestions, first aired in the New York Times on Friday, that the questioning of Mr Kerry's war record is tied to the White House. </p> <p>In a sign that Mr Kerry has been angered by the assault on his war record and the reticence of President Bush to condemn the group's attacks, the Democratic nominee released a TV commercial rebutting the charges. Noting that there are many problems facing the country in election year, including healthcare and Iraq, the commercial argued that \"instead of solutions, George Bush's campaign supports a smear group attacking John Kerry's war record ... Get back to the issues.\" </p> <p>But Mr Kerry received a fillip yesterday with the publication in the Chicago Tribune of a first-person article by a senior editor who commanded a swift (river patrol) boat alongside Mr Kerry. William Rood's account of the events preceding Mr Kerry's award back up the candidate's version. </p> <p>\"It's gotten harder and harder for those of us who were there to listen to accounts we know to be untrue, especially when they come from people who were not there,\" Mr Rood wrote in a sideswipe at the credentials of some of the members of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. </p> <p>Mr Rood scorned one of the group's allegations: that Mr Kerry had not chased and killed a Vietcong soldier but a \"teenager in a loincloth\". </p> <p>\"He was a grown man, dressed in the kind of garb the VC usually wore.\" </p> <p>He highlighted the alleged inconsistencies of some of Mr Kerry's critics, pointing out that Roy Hoffmann, then a rear admiral, now a leading voice in the anti-Kerry veterans' group, had congratulated Mr Kerry on the day. </p> <p>At the weekend Mr Kerry told a fundraising event in East Hamptons: \"We're at war ... a different kind of war from any kind of war we've fought before, and it's because in the last months they [the Republicans] have seen me climbing in America's understanding that I know how to fight a smarter and more effective war.\" </p> <p>On Friday Mr Kerry complained to the federal election commission that the veterans' group had violated election law by coordinating its attacks with the White House. In turn, the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, accused Mr Kerry of \"losing his cool\". </p> <p>The debate on Mr Kerry's war record has peaked just as the Republican party prepares for next week's convention, which is expected to portray George Bush as the only dependable leader in time of war. </p> <p>The attacks seem to have helped Mr Bush. Approval for Mr Kerry among Vietnam veterans has declined since the Democratic convention, which concentrated heavily on his war record. His decision to ignore them in the hope that they would fizzle out appears to have been a miscalculation.</p>",

  "<p>A majority of workers believe their productivity will be so impaired when 24-hour pub drinking becomes possible next summer that the economy will suffer. </p> <p>The ill effects of a big night out already cost the UK \u00a32.8bn a year, and more than half of respondents in a survey said that the extension of hours, when the 2003 Licensing Act comes into force, would adversely affect their work. </p> <p>Respondents admitted to occasions when they passed out, felt apathetic or ill, had been unable to deal with things, spoken out of turn, or thrown up in the working day. </p> <p>Some said they had had to be taken home by a colleague after slurring words or becoming unnecessarily angry. </p> <p>The survey of 8,400 British workers by recruitment website <a href=\"http://www.reed.co.uk\">reed.co.uk</a> found that those aged between 18 and 25 were the most likely to say the change would have an adverse effect on their productivity. </p> <p>Reed's manager, Martin Warnes, pointed out that licensing laws were introduced in the first world war because munitions workers became incapable through drink, and he questioned the wisdom of trying to introduce a European style of drinking culture through legislation. </p> <p>About a third of respondents thought it acceptable to arrive at work with a hangover. And women showed a more light-hearted attitude to excessive drinking than men, the report said. </p> <p>The recruitment company's marketing director, Katy Nicholson, commented: \"The government strongly believes that extending licensing laws will cut down ... the disruption associated with binge drinking. But the reality is that groups of people accelerate their drinking, and line [up] orders, and then they burst on to the streets very inebriated and cause a lot of disruption. </p> <p>\"Many people across country towns near pubs and in cities could attest to that.\" </p> <p>Ten million working days a year are lost because of excessive drinking, at an estimated cost of \u00a3960m.

  "<p>There is not much romance in accountancy but during the 1990s, the instrument known as the share option seemed to offer the fairytale promise of rags to riches. Cinderellas toiled as secretaries, receptionists and commissionaires in exchange for magic beans which, with the wave of the fairy godmother's wand, became a fortune. But in a few months' time, the fairy godmother is due to get her wings clipped as new regulations make share options far less attractive to employers, if not employees. </p> <p>A share option is the opportunity to buy a number of shares at a fixed price. Not very exciting in itself but imagine if you could buy Microsoft shares at 1986 prices and sell them at 1999 prices (as some lucky employees could and did) and you will see the potential. Employers like share options because it enables them to give staff something which costs them nothing. From the beginning of next year, however, this will no longer be the case. Companies must declare the share options they hand out as costs on their balance sheets. Halliwell, a firm which specialises in advising companies on employee benefit packages, warns that this could knock as much as 7.5% off the profits of some the biggest companies. </p> <p>The regulation has been imported, as an international standard, from the US where there is much disenchantment with share options after (among other things), some naughty fairies in Texas were caught handing out beans they knew were not magic at all. Although instances can be found of share options making ordinary employees if not rich, than considerably better off, such instruments are quite rightly associated in the public mind with the extraordinary rewards paid to senior executives of large corporations - rewards that often appear to have little connection with performance. Halliwell's analysis, however, suggests that the new regulation will do more to disadvantage smaller companies that include all their employees in share reward schemes than to bring boardroom salaries under control. </p> <p>The quite legitimate aspect of share options, to function as a potential reward for employees who take smaller salaries in a company that has just started up, in the hope of cashing in on its future success, will become much more costly.</p>",
  "<p>There's just something about leaving a voicemail message that can turn even the most articulate, erudite speakers into a stuttering, grunting mess with a vocabulary of 17 words, three of which are \"um\", \"ah\" and \"uh\". Not to mention, of course, the ridiculously cheery and high-pitched \"Byeeee!\" that you are astounded to hear coming out of your mouth as you sign off. But it's something we've all had to get used to; in fact, I've come to love the sound of \"I'm not at my desk right now, so leave me a message\" because it means that the bad news about some workplace mix-up that I invariably have to communicate comes from a recording of my voice and not actually from me, which makes it, in some vague but important way, less my fault. </p> <p>I could never reach the point so often documented on celluloid where some impatient caller fills the slowly spooling answerphone tape with demands of \"I know you're there ... come on ... pick up.\" Of course, the person is invariably there, hovering over the phone. But you know that if I left a rambling message insisting that the person that I was calling was most certainly in their home, it would turn out they'd been in Australia for six weeks. </p> <p>But on the whole, I have learned to stop worrying and love leaving messages. The problem of my own voicemail greeting remains. Like the shoes you wear or the car you drive, it says a lot about you, often to total strangers, some of whom you might actually want to impress. However, I am here to tell you that there's no such thing as an impressive voicemail greeting, although you can avoid some obvious pitfalls - like being honest: \"Hi, it's Monday 21st. I'm in meetings from 11am until 5pm, after which time I'll be going home to gaze helplessly out of the window and wonder what happened to my life.\" Equally, no one wants to call you to hear that you'll be out of the office for two weeks on your annual skiing trip. </p> <p>Also, remember it's the law that if you try to record your voicemail greeting in the office it will be at the very same moment that your colleagues start a high-decibel discussion in the background about some disgusting medical ailment. </p> <p>Even if they're not around, you'll still manage to sound one of the following: drunk, hysterical, depressive, confused or manically cheery. And in which of those ways would you like to greet important clients and customers? Tell you what, why don't you just send an email instead?</p>",
  "<p>Train staff are experiencing such high levels of violence from passengers that they are to be issued with DNA kits. The kits will include swabs and sterile bags that can be used to preserve traces of saliva as evidence in the quest to bring offenders to justice. But before you thank your lucky stars that you'll never need your own DNA kit in your line of work, think again. Office workers are joining the list of those at risk. </p> <p>\"People have long accepted that violence can be a big problem for people like police and security guards,\" says Dr Phil Leather, occupational psychologist at the University of Nottingham's Institute of Work, Health and Organisations. \"Now it's a major issue for people in any job or workplace where there are dealings with the public. This ranges from nurses to social workers to shop assistants to secretaries.\" Indeed, Whittington Hospital NHS Trust is one of the most recent organisations to provide all front-line staff - from nurses to receptionists - with some training so that they can understand and respond to the risks they face. </p> <p>Having studied work-related violence for some 20 years, Dr Leather points out that it doesn't only include physical assaults. \"We are talking about any incident in which a person is abused, threatened or assaulted in circumstances related to work,\" he says. \"Thankfully, in most occupations, actual physical assault is uncommon. But people getting irate enough to make you feel threatened in some way is much more common - and it's equally unacceptable.\" </p> <p>Some incidents arise purely from aggressive individuals, he says. \"But there are also certain situations that we know can provoke aggression and the most common is where a service is denied. That's the point when negative emotion may be generated, which can turn to anger or frustration and then violence.\" </p> <p>Jenny Butler, a secretary for a retail outlet in south-west London, knows this all too well. \"Customers sometimes have complaints that they want to talk to my boss about,\" she says. \"Once or twice, when he hasn't been available, customers have shouted and sworn at me. One guy pointed his finger in my face and another waved his fist at me, accusing me of lying. It was very frightening.\" </p> <p>The millennial attitude that \"the customer is king\" is almost certainly partly responsible for such episodes. The Customer's Charter and the Patient's Charter - as well as the 24-hour society in which we now live - are all examples of things that encourage the public to expect instant and effective results. When it doesn't happen, they can become unreasonable. </p> <p>The long-hours culture and growing pressure of today's workplaces may also be to blame. Staff tempers become shorter and employees can sometimes even become aggressive themselves which, in turn, can encourage clients or customers with a grievance to turn nasty. And this time of year is particularly bad, according to the TUC. \"The heat and lack of ventilation can make people's tempers much shorter,\" says Tom Mellish, health and safety policy officer at the TUC. </p> <p>Even those who don't work face-to-face with the public can be at risk. \"Phone rage - as it has been termed - is now experienced by thousands of employees who increasingly suffer emotional trauma from being on the receiving end,\" says a spokeswoman for the Work Foundation. Swearing, personal remarks and threats are cited as the most common forms of phone rage, and while perpetrators are most likely to be customers or clients, colleagues are also guilty. \"Research shows that people are at least five times more likely to lose their temper when dealing with businesses - including the ones they work for - than they were 15 years ago,\" says the spokeswoman. </p> <p>She believes that it's because we are so used to achieving results at the touch of a button that we have become far more demanding and impatient. In addition, the phone is \"immediate\". If you have a gripe and have to actually travel to someone's office to discuss it, your anger is likely have tailed off by the time you arrive, whereas if you simply pick up the phone, your rage will still be at its peak. The anonymity of the telephone may also be relevant. \"It is well known in social psychology that it's far easier to be aggressive towards someone depersonalised,\" says Dr Leather. </p> <p>Even though employers have a duty to protect staff from violence at work under health and safety legislation, many still have the ostrich mentality. Suzanne Hagden, a receptionist at a leisure centre in Birmingham believes it's because managers don't realise the extent of the problem. \"By the time I called my manager in on the three occasions I have been threatened, the customer had usually calmed down a bit, so the manager never saw the worst of it,\" she says. </p> <p>Immogen Haslam, adviser for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development thinks it's high time employers woke up to the problem. \"There is a clear cost to business in terms of lack of morale and motivation, as well as the possibility of increased absenteeism,\" she says. \"Businesses who choose to ignore the problem may also find it harder to recruit or retain staff and there could be damage to their employer brand. It could even hit them in the wallet if a compensation claim is taken out.\" </p> <p>Tom Mellish agrees. \"We're not sure if violent episodes at work are on the rise, because so many go unreported. But employees' perception is that it has risen and that in itself is making them edgy - something that employers should take notice of.\" </p> <p>London Underground is among those who have done so. A five-day training course gives new staff the soft skills they need to defuse difficult situations and to understand when it's best to walk away from an abusive customer - without turning their back on them. \"We also have a workplace violence champion and we are increasingly monitoring and investigating the problem,\" says Kevin Dulling, London Underground's crime and disorder support manager. </p> <p>London Underground is also among a growing number of organisations that are getting better at telling its customers what is unacceptable behaviour. You can now see notices in tube stations, on buses, in benefits offices and a whole range of other locations where employees meet the public face to face. These can be particularly important because what one person experiences as aggressive behaviour may not be considered so by another, according to Pierre Lombard, a training consultant at the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, the leading authority on personal safety. </p> <p>Lombard, who is being called in by a growing number of organisations to train employees, adds that employees themselves can help prevent danger in some situations. \"In our training, we focus on two main areas - anticipating and reducing risks and defusing aggression,\" he says. Controlling the tone of your voice, being empathetic and always giving a reason for what has happened can help. Meanwhile, using the person's name and giving them yours can remind them that you are an individual. \"Body language is important too,\" says Lombard. \"Your facial expression and what you do with your hands, for example, can make someone feel and act in a certain way. Behaviour breeds behaviour.\" If all else fails, you should explain to the person that their behaviour is unacceptable and that you will end the conversation if the abuse continues. </p> <p>Above all, nobody should have to put up with feeling threatened at work, says Lombard. Even if the customer is right in what they say - for example, they didn't get what they ordered or the train was two hours late - there's no reason why that situation should lead to abuse. Civility, we should all remember, is always an option.</p>",
  "<p>So, you think you are coming up with the goods and worth more money but are too scared to ask for a pay rise? Approaching the boss to ask for more cash can be nerve-racking, but careful preparation can help negotiations go your way. </p> <p>Research by <a href=\"http://www.Payfinder.com\">Payfinder.com</a> suggests that on average men are paid 24% more than women, while the Office for National Statistics puts the difference at 19%. These figures are backed up by Virgin Money's Show Me the Money study, which found that men have the edge when it comes to negotiating for higher pay. More than a quarter of employers said that men are better at finagling a better deal for themselves. And women agreed with two in five saying men are better at asking for more cash. </p> <p>Dianah Worman, of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, says women do not shout or push for a pay rise as much as men. \"It's about how confident you are at putting your case, how bold you are and how much pressure you put on,\" she says. \"Men are more likely to have a go and claim they can do something well but women will make sure they can do something before they ask. But this leaves women behind.\" </p> <p>When Jane McClemont, an events producer, discovered a male colleague was earning \u00a33,000 more than her, she was initially outraged. He told her that he had put together a case asking for more money and put it to their manager. When McClemont took the same approach and came up with a list of reasons why she was worth more, she too was awarded a rise. \"Looking back, I don't know why I didn't just think to ask for more money,\" she says. \"I suppose I was scared I would be turned down or that my manager would point out things I wasn't doing right.\" </p> <p>Discovering that a colleague earns more than you is not necessarily a good basis on which to negotiate. Factors such as time in service, experience and qualifications could mean a co-worker quite justifiably has a higher salary. Sophie Relf, head of campaign management at Workthing.com and author of The Right Career Moves Handbook, says: \"Before I considered asking for a rise I would check the background behind why someone was earning more than me. You wouldn't want to ask for a rise only to draw attention to the fact that you had failed to deliver on an objective or project or that your co-workers do better than you.\" </p> <p>The Virgin study found that more than half of Britain's bosses say the threat of another job offer would persuade them to offer an employee a pay increase, while 45% admire workers who fight for more money. </p> <p> Reed Employment director Dan Ferrandino says getting a pay rise is not always the daunting prospect it seems. If you know you are performing well and think you deserve more money, then you should not be worried about broaching the subject - provided you take certain elementary precautions. </p> <p>Experts agree that preparation is the key to successfully negotiating a rise and that an employee should work out not only the reasons why they deserve a rise but also ways to deal with possible objections. </p> <p>Relf says workers should show what they have achieved and how they have gone about it. Reduced costs, increased revenue, sales and efficiency are all good ways to prove your value to the business. What women in particular tend to forget is that pay-rise negotiations are about maths and good business sense; they are not emotional transactions. \"Leave your heart out of the negotiation; bring your head and some facts to back up your request instead,\" she says. </p> <p>Relf suggests researching the going rate for your job by looking at recruitment websites that have a salary calculator or looking at job adverts for similar positions. The next step is to work out your top and bottom line and other factors such as flexible working, holiday leave and training, which do not have a direct monetary value but which matter to you. </p> <p>Then book a meeting with your boss. Broaching the subject at the coffee machine or at a social gathering is not the way to succeed in your aim. Ferrandino says: \"It is important to put forward a business case to your employer, rather than an out-of-context demand. Book the time with your boss and do your homework beforehand. Time and effort put into preparing a business case with achievements is more likely to be rewarded with a pay rise.\" </p> <p>Finding out the company policy on pay is also important, as in some companies managers may only be able to sign pay rises up to a certain percentage increase. Employers will be looking at how the job sits in the salary structure, the market rate for the job and the value of the role to company performance. Other factors such as the state of the economy, the rate of inflation, pay deals between the company and unions and how the company is performing will also affect the outcome. </p> <p>Job offers from rival companies can be a useful bargaining tool but only threaten to leave if you are prepared to carry out your threat. Asking for a rise for personal reason, such as additional financial commitments, is not advisable. Employees should stick to reasons relating to their job. </p> <p>But always remember, as Worman says: \"If you don't ask, you don't get.\"</p>"
