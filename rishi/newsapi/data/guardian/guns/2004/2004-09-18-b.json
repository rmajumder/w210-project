  "<p>Crisis, which crisis? Oil, politics, war, house prices, hurricanes: together they fuse to create a reality that feels, well, pretty normal. One may briefly rise above the others for a gnawing moment in the pit of the stomach, but each is losing its ability to terrorise investors. The true financial crisis may be far less dramatic, much more insidious. </p> <p>Investors have learned to live with the dangers of the modern world. That is not to say that terrorism, natural disasters and megalomaniac politicians don't affect asset prices. Rather that markets have demonstrated their ability to adjust to reflect sudden shocks and, through their durability, enable participants in time to rediscover their innate optimism.</p> <p><strong>Nothing is predictable</strong><br></p> <p>The great bull markets have each ended with a feeling of crisis. My dictionary defines 'crisis' as a crucial stage or turning point, an unstable period of extreme danger. It would be wrong, though, to assume that the turning point in share prices and their subsequent instability is reached because of contextual crises. Bull markets tend to take place against a background of crises. Who is to say that a particular crisis then causes a market crash. It may just be coincidence.</p> <p>Chaos theory talks of apparently insignificant events having unexpected dramatic consequences. The beat of a butterfly's wings, through a lengthy chain of unpredictable effects, may cause a tidal wave on the other side of the globe. In a chaotic financial world, confidence is a cloak investors wear to enable them to get out of bed and face the day. In truth, nothing is predictable and little analysable.</p> <p>The last three major bear markets began in 1973, 1987 and 2000. The first took place against the backdrop of an oil price rise that was truly shocking, crunching economic activity. Here there was identifiable cause and effect. The latter two, however, were very different. If there was a cause of the slump in share prices it was simply that they had previously risen too far.</p> <p>In 1987 a physical storm infamously swept through the City in advance of the financial one. But there was no hurricane in Manhattan and, as usual, it was the US stock market that led the way. Share price falls were triggered by shocking trade figures and a rise in interest rates.</p> <p>The market had lived with the economic crisis for months, however. A rate rise may have been the straw that broke the camel's back, but most of the beast's burden was the over-optimism of in vestors enthused by the success of their own speculation.</p> <p>While in 1987 the market turn could be dated and had a demonstrable trigger, the bear market in spring 2000 was altogether sketchier in origin. Different indices peaked at different times. There was no one corporate or economic shock that could in itself be deemed a crisis. As in the run-up to the 1987 crash, equity valuations had become stretched as euphoria washed away investors' natural fears.</p> <p>But the degree of separation of hope from reality was far, far greater this time. With hindsight, the crisis was this separation itself, not any economic or political event. The background to the dotcom bubble that eventually burst in 2000 was unusually benign, with an absence of the rolling crises that had come to be regarded as normal, and are again today. The financial crisis sprang, perhaps, from this absence of crisis. This was a world in which the authorities could talk of economic miracles and be believed.</p> <p><strong> Nervous breakdown</strong><br> </p> <p>If the turn of the millennium was an abnormal period, today's traumas are a return to business as usual. A genuine shock, akin to that of oil prices in the 70s, would have a proportionate effect on markets. If share valuations became bloated, as in the 1980s, they would be an accident waiting to happen. Investors can live with such risks. Shares deliver superior returns to cash over the long haul as the reward for accepting risk. And if they are to fall from a lofty pedestal, they have to get there (profitably) first. </p> <p>There seems little prospect, at present, of such a re-rating of equities. Not that there aren't grounds for optimism. Corporate profits continue to expand. There is takeover activity. However, at the margin the economic news is poor. Share prices could shrug this off if they were starting from a depressed level. But they are not. Valuations are full enough to force investors to be positive before buying shares. When values are low they need only be less negative than they were before.</p> <p>As stock markets continue to mark time, the true villain of the piece continues to do its crafty work. Low inflation helped to push equity values up. Now they are there, it spells thin returns. This will eat at investor optimism, as will the realisation that there are not attractive alternatives elsewhere. In time, sinking optimism and growing frustration could lead to a collective nervous breakdown: another crisis of the market's own making. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Edmond Warner is chief executive of IFX Group </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edmond.warner@theguardian.com\">edmond.warner@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Big Food Group confirmed it has received a \u00a3380m bid from the Icelandic investor Baugur, owner of toy retailer Hamleys. </p> <p>The Iceland frozen food and Booker cash and carry operation was forced to admit the approach following a report in yesterday's Guardian. </p> <p>Its shares rose 10.5p to 102.75p, continuing the rise from below 90p which began on Thursday. </p> <p>The \"preliminary\" talks with Baugur value each share at 110p, but the company said the Icelandic financiers had reserved the right to clinch a deal at a lower price after due diligence. </p> <p>The approach from Baugur, which owns 22% of Big Food, forced the company to admit that its trading had deteriorated of late. </p> <p>Bill Grimsey, the chief executive of Big Food, said the trading environment was \"difficult\". </p> <p>Big Food had said in July that trading was tough. \"Since then, weather conditions have been generally worse than last year, impacting the performance of a number of retailers,\" the company said. </p> <p>\"The environment has also continued to be challenging in the light of consolidation in the grocery market and increasing price competition, which is expected to continue.\" </p> <p>The group's comparative sales in the 10 weeks to September 10 were down 3.2%, worse than the 1.7% fall for the longer 23-week period to Sep tember 10. At Iceland the fall in the 10 weeks was 3.8% - more than the 2.6% in the longer period. </p> <p>At Booker sales were down 4.1% in the 10-week period compared with a 2.4% fall for the 23 weeks. </p> <p>The company, which is due to report its profits for the half year in November, said cost control and margin protection had helped to \"mitigate\" the slower sales. </p> <p>City sources said it was by no means certain that a deal would be clinched by Baugur, which this week sold its stake in department store House of Fraser. The Icelandic financier also owns women's clothing chains Oasis and Karen Millen and jeweller Goldsmiths, and was thought to be interested in buying Hobbs. </p> <p>Mr Grimsey admitted that the approach from Baugur might help to flush out other bidders but revealed that he thought it was likely the board would recommend the Icelandic offer if a deal could be arranged. </p> <p>Analysts were doubtful about whether a deal could be agreed. They pointed to the \u00a3100m deficit in the pension fund and \u00a3260m debt. </p> <p>The company was formed through the merger of Iceland and Booker, which was run by Stuart Rose, the present chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer. </p> <p>Share-dealing after the deal was clinched, by Malcolm Walker - who was chairman of Iceland - has been referred to the Serious Fraud Office.</p>",
  "<p>In the winter of 2002, my wife and I decided to take a wild gamble with our children's education and welfare. Rather than endure another dull winter in London, we packed four rucksacks, removed our children from school and flew to Vilcabamba, a remote village in southern Ecuador. </p> <p>That my daughter, Olivia, had just sat her exams for secondary school and we had her headmaster's blessing, or that we would be living in a wooden cabin in the middle of an eco-reserve - an experience which we felt could not be anything but educational - was neither here nor there. As far as our friends and family were concerned, we were being reckless and irresponsible. What if our children fell ill and we could not get them to a doctor? Worse, what if Olivia was accepted by one of the schools she had applied to and we failed to respond to the offer letter in time? </p> <p>In the event, the latter proved to be the most pressing concern. Although Vilcabamba boasts a modern health clinic, the village has only a handful of phone lines and, as we discovered soon after our arrival when we tried to email a friend to check the post, internet connections are erratic. Having said that, we never regretted our decision. </p> <p>From the moment we arrived at the Pole House - a log cabin in the middle of the Rumi-Wilco nature reserve - we were besotted. Suspended some 20ft above the forest floor beside a fast-flowing river, the Pole House boasted a rudimentary kitchen and one double and two bunk beds, but little else. It was bliss. We fell asleep to the rumble of the R\u00edo Chambo's churning waters and awoke to the squawk of parakeets and bright sunlight flooding through the loose-fitting wooden planks. From our first floor shutters we only had to reach out a hand to pluck oranges, tree tomatoes, bananas and passion fruit from the overhanging branches. In its one concession to modernity, the Pole House came equipped with a blender and we were soon mixing tropical smoothies to order. Not only that but Rumi-Wilco boasted its own shade-grown organic coffee. On arrival, we found a packet of ready roasted beans awaiting us in a welcome pack together with a delicious marmalade made from granadilla, another tropical fruit. </p> <p>The welcome pack, like the Pole House and its surroundings, is the brainchild of Orlando and Alicia Falco, a husband-and-wife team of biologists who used to work as guides in the Galapagos Islands. Depressed by the commercialisation of the islands and their steady erosion by tourism, the Falcos moved to Vilcabamba 10 years ago determined to start a reserve where their family and a few guests could live in harmony with nature. </p> <p>Orlando began by taming the river, then set about replanting native podocarpus and wilco trees in the surrounding hillsides. The result is that today Rumi-Wilco is self-sufficient in pretty much everything but electricity. The forest supplies all the Falcos' fruit and vegetable needs, while water for drinking and showering is drawn straight from a well. To pay for the upkeep of the reserve and extras such as bread and clothing, the Falcos rent out the Pole House and several adobe huts to passing backpackers. Needless to say, Rumi-Wilco proved both a revelation and an education. </p> <p>No sooner had we settled into our cramped accommodation than Olivia and Max disappeared into the forest with the Falcos' three children, Melissa, Omar and Lucas. Several hours later they returned from their botanising, their arms brimming with orchids, bromeliads and blue morpho butterflies. Within a week, these nature-adverse city dwellers (in London, Olivia and Max cower at the mere sight of an ant or spider) could name every tree on the reserve as well as several species of birds and insects. Max was particularly taken by the rhinoceros beetle - so named because of the vicious horn that protrudes from its hard black shell. However, his and his sister's fascination with the bugs that invaded our sleeping quarters each night soon paled into insignificance when we rode into the mountains high above the village. </p> <p>Vilcabamba is Quichua for \"sacred valley\". Orlando theorised that the area had been named after the wilco tree, whose seeds were prized by Inca shamans as a hallucinogen - hence his decision to cultivate the trees on his reserve. But the Incas, who arrived here in around 1480, some 50 years before the Spanish, may simply have fallen in love with the valley's idyllic setting. </p> <p>Although just four degrees south of the equator, the mountains on either side of Vilcabamba form a barrier against the humidity from the Pacific and Amazon, resulting in year-round blue skies and a mean temperature of 20C. After the conquest and independence, the Ecuadorian government forgot about Vilcabamba, but in 1955 the valley was \"rediscovered\" when Reader's Digest published an article remarking on the low incidence of heart disease and osteoporosis. Soon scientists and health tourists from around the globe were flocking to Vilcabamba drawn by reports of its youthful centenarians and their mineral-rich drinking water. Unfortunately, many of the supposed 100-year-olds turned out to be not quite 90, but the water was everything that had been advertised and by the early 1980s Vilcabamba had become a fixture on the hippy trail. </p> <p>Today, the village - with its small plaza dominated by a pretty white-and-blue church - attracts a mixture of bohemians and backpackers. Some come, as we did, for the nature and tranquility; others to party and sample san pedro, a psychotropic cactus that grows wild on nearby mountainsides. But whatever your motivation for visiting Vilcabamba, this Ecuadorian Shangri-La soon casts its spell. </p> <p>From our base at the Pole House, we could venture deep into the forest or trek high into the mountains above the village - the home not only of san pedro but of cinchona, the source of the valuable anti-malarial, quinine. One week, we hired a guide and ponies and rode to Las Palmas, a mountain refuge at 7,000ft which boasted spectacular waterfalls and its own treetop canopy walk. Each of these excursions was an education not just in botany and geology but in culture and also endurance. The refuge was empty when we reached Las Palmas, but by day two it was brimming with French, Dutch and Chilean backpackers (we communicated in Franco-Spanglish). Then, on day three, we hiked seven miles back down to the foot of the mountain, our guide having left earlier with the horses. I am happy to report that Olivia and Max, who cannot walk more than a few feet in London without complaining of fatigue, cantered to the bottom - a feat we put down to the scenery and our promise to treat them to omelettes and ice cream at Ch\u00e9, a favourite cafe in Vilcabamba's main square. </p> <p>Our most treasured moment, however, came on an excursion to another mountain - the Cerro Mandango. Rising 6,000ft above Vilcabamba, Mandango is steeped in mystery and legend. According to one story, in 1534 after the conquistadors executed the Inca king Atahualpa in Peru, loyal Indian troops hid a vast cache of gold in a huaca (cave) in Mandango's side. Over the intervening centuries, the precise location of the huaca had been lost but, according to local folklore, at Easter during Semana Santa it would open to one of true heart. </p> <p>There was just one catch: the huaca was guarded by a cantankerous old man, a dog and a rooster. Every easter young Vilcabambans climbed the mountain and placed a cigarillo, a bone and a kernel of corn near the peak - the idea being that while the old man smoked the cigarillo, the dog was occupied with the bone and the rooster pecked at the corn, the entrance to the cave would reveal itself and they could rifle the gold. So far, however, no one had been quick enough. </p> <p>My son was fascinated by the story, the more so when we arrived at a small farmstead at the foot of the mountain and found our way blocked by an ill-tempered dog. We had no bone with us but fortunately we had brought some local toffee. Scattering it in the animal's path, we hurried up the steep gravel path leading to the summit - a grassy knoll with sheer chalk sides which in profile resembled a man's nose and mouth. It was my daughter who finally found a route to the top, clawing her way up by her fingernails. </p> <p>There was no gold there but we discovered something just as valuable: a 360-degree panorama. To the west we could just make out the old Inca trail running along the Cordillera de los Chillos, to the east the dropping peaks of the lower Ecuadorian Andes, and, sandwiched in between draped in mist, Vilcabamba, the so-called Valley of Eternal Youth. </p> <p>Later that evening my son described the outing in his diary. \"We climbed a mountain that looks like a man's face. It is called Cerro Mandango. We walked through clouds.\" </p> <p>It may not have been poetry exactly but every word was perfectly spelt. A few days later, we obtained a working internet connection and learned that Olivia had been offered a place at her first-choice school. We emailed her acceptance immediately, then returned to the Pole House and toasted her the only way we could - with a banana and passion fruit smoothie. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Mark Honigsbaum is the author of Valverde's Gold: a true tale of greed, obsession and grit, published by Macmillan at \u00a318.99.

  "<p>The black and white photograph can't show the airforce-blue shirts or differentiate among the ties of many house colours worn by the 15- and 16-year-olds of Form 5P, Kidbrooke Comprehensive School for Girls. The long picture, rolled into a scroll, has survived somehow for more than 40 years, weathering many changes of address and circumstance, and whenever I came across it, the faces there, one of which shall be nameless pierced by a drawing pin, brought memories of what was in many ways an unhappy and surreal time. Much of the misery was because of my beloved mother's acute attacks of rheumatoid arthritis and stays in hospital - grim New Cross and Guys in the fog and snow - and the general disintegration of family life, but starting a new and much bigger school at 15 proved difficult. There were also boyfriends and the attractions of London, a train ride away from Westcombe Park station.</p> <p>Kidbrooke was a showplace comprehensive whose head, Mary Green, was made a dame; it had some 2,000 girls and about 15 forms to each year. Neither of my two close friends was in my form, but there were classmates I remember with affection and curiosity. Our form room was a science lab and I can still hear the pop songs of the day sung among the bunsen burners and the tales of one of our members' exploits. I can't recall which distinguished architect designed the buildings but I think I should like them now; then, Kidbrooke was a stalag where I got lost every day, and usually caught the wrong bus home. There is a fictional scene of disgrace in my first novella, Dust Falls on Eugene Schlumburger, which is set at morning assembly in Kidbrooke's vast and intimidating school hall, wherein three bullies are shamed for not only beating up a younger pupil but for not wearing their berets at the time of the offence. The landscapes of Greenwich and Deptford also inform the book.</p> <p>The novel, as I thought it was until it was typed out, was originally titled The Night is So Lonely after the Gene Vincent song. The story was written at night to a background of Radio Luxembourg, and I wish I could recapture the pleasure and excitement I felt while writing it. My mother suggested that I change the title to something less trite, and it became Dust Falls... and was published with my second novella by Andre Deutsch in one volume, which became known as \"the upside-down book\". Its striking pink and orange cover, the fact that it was reversible, and my youth all attracted attention.</p> <p>My time at Kidbrooke was marked by fear - of truancy discovered, games lessons spent hiding, homework not done, of having to wear clothes \"more suitable for a dance hall\" because my uniform, on order, had not arrived in the shop. But, as there is so often, there was a sympathetic English teacher. Miss Campbell had been at university with Auden and MacNeice and loved Thomas Hardy. It was she who suggested I enter the Daily Mirror Children's Literary Competition, although I had decided to leave school by this time, and had already submitted some poems. There were two winners from Kidbrooke, and the \u00a325 prize encouraged me to think I might be a writer, as I intended. The money had to be spent on clothes for a short-lived job as an office junior.</p> <p>Last year, the black and white photograph was turned to living colour. At four o'clock on a spring afternoon, with London in blossom and the Thames running past the windows of the Festival Hall, a class reunion took place in the foyer caf\u00e9. Several tables had been pushed together and there were many of the girls sitting along them, as if in the school dining hall. Under hair which had changed colour, from black to blonde, or grey, the faces came into focus and were recognisable as those of the girls they had been. The \"girl\" who had organised the reunion was not much altered, the twins were there in similar outfits, all had stories to tell.</p> <p>The girl whom I had admired for her subversion, who had told such marvellous tales, admitted laughingly that \"they were all porky-pies\". It was wonderful and for me had a redemptive quality, as the feelings of failure and disaffectedness I experienced at Kidbrooke dissolved and I felt like a member of 5P in a way I should never have suspected. What I felt overwhelmingly was pride in us all, that we were not such a bad generation.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Heligoland (Vintage) was shortlisted for the Whitbread novel award.</p>",

  "<p>Abergavenny - or Y Fenni in Welsh - lies hugged by a bend in the river Usk, and dominated by the Blorenge, a great heathery hill that rears up to the southwest. For a few days every September the quiet, leafy little town bursts into an almost tropical bloom with the celebration of the Abergavenny Food Festival. </p> <p>I like Abergavenny; the country round about is beautiful, with its river and its hills. And festival or no, you can always get a good feed, because as a result of some unfathomable glitch in the space/time continuum, the place is alive with top Italian chefs who run exquisite country restaurants and hotels (the first was Franco Taruschio who set up the Walnut Tree Inn with his wife Ann, though it is now under new ownership). And these Italians, having set themselves up, have magnanimously showed everybody else how to do it, resulting in one of the best concentrations of board and bed anywhere in the land. It may be this singular phenomenon that gave rise to the festival, and thus by extension to my presence here. </p> <p>I was whisked to the Market Hall, the nerve centre of the proceedings, to witness the Fanfare for the Festival. There was a medieval feel to the thing as we sat - hundreds of us - at trestle tables and fell eagerly upon the tender young pigs that had been prepared for our delectation by a team of spectacularly good chefs. In order to assist the passage of the pork, there were wines from everywhere - even Wales itself - and sinister ciders, and unexpectedly beautiful beers. Beers, I soon learned, that were produced by passionate men burning the midnight oil in their microscopic breweries in order that the subtle magic of brewing be not lost to the dull machinations of the industrialised conglomerates. You could taste the passion in it. I don't even like beer very much, but by the time a few of these brewers had had their way with me, their fruity brown beers became the quintessence of all that was lovable about mankind. </p> <p>As we, the revellers, addressed ourselves to this fabulous fare, we were entertained by musicians of every persuasion, starting with a Welsh choir that made me weep into my beer - these people know how to sing - and culminating with a Salsa band. </p> <p>At the end of a long evening I crept to my bed, glistening with pork and awash with beer. Of course, I didn't sleep a wink; I lay awake thinking about the festival and what it was all about ... was it just another scam to gull the public into injecting a load of cash into a lumbering local economy? - which, let's face it, some festivals are - or was it more than that? </p> <p>I was oiled and fired up that night, and these are the conclusions I came to: here was a hotbed of gastronomic anarchy; these people were flying in the face of health and safety council directives, barefacedly flouting the laws and regulations imposed by the British government and the EU. Unlike the usual whingeing British way, they were taking leaves from Spanish and French books - if they can't see the sense in a law, they'd ignore it. </p> <p>All these regulations - the straightness of cucumbers, the conformity of apples, the detestable cellophane wrapper ... the thousand and more nonsensical regulations forced upon us by the lobbying of the industrial food-producing conglomerates, to ensure that nobody but themselves gets a look in ... all these were being joyously flouted. This festival was an exuberant celebration of what good food should be about, prepared by people who understand and love what they're doing, for people who know how to appreciate it. Here were the small producers, the family farm, the gifted enthusiast, the privately run restaurant, putting one over on the gargantuan consortia who seek through their power and political influence to give us no alternative to the loveless anodyne pap that they would foist upon us. </p> <p>And these were not people who would return us to a dark age of ill health and dangerously dirty food habits, but those who would seek to preserve the quality, the art and the skill that make food both nourishing and pleasurable. </p> <p>In the morning I arose with this premise boiling in my head, and set out to prove it. By the time I got back to the town people were pouring in, marshalled by big, shiny-faced farm boys down from the hills for the day. The sun warmed them and made them glad as they strolled among the street players. It was glorious, the streets were alive with music, from string quartets to fiddlers and folk bands, and a dazzling guitar and saxophone duo. This is the way urban life ought to be, I thought to myself. The sunshine and the music, and the food and drink and the good nature of the mild-mannered border-folk, all went to weave a Mediterranean spell upon the place. </p> <p>And then there were the events. There was a sushi demonstration where I learned - as I'd really known all along - that what I served up at home in the guise of sushi was nothing more than cold rice-pudding wrapped in damp seaweed. There were cookery demonstrations of every hue, and I hung transfixed upon the lips of the demonstrators. There were debates, too, in pubs, with mugs of beer and a jolly rabble, and speaches from the big cheeses in the world of food and catering. </p> <p>My head fuddled by debate, and equally convinced by all passionately opposing views, I headed back to the Market Hall. Here now was haberdashery and bookshops, and fresh Thai food, as well as home-made pies and butties and pasties. Cakes and jams, cheeses and honey, mushrooms and succulent Welsh meat and a huge array of other victuals were there, too, to gladden the hungry heart. </p> <p>But out the back in the market yard was for me the finest thing of the whole festival. You may think I'm obsessed with pork, and indeed maybe I am, because I think that a well roast pig is a hot contender for the very acme of human felicity - and you can't get roast pork in Spain, where I live. What it was, was a huge golden pig. It was roasted on a spit by a team of the jolliest folks who ever stuck and roasted a porker. It was crisp and crackly, the meat rich and sweet and all the most glorious golden brown. You could buy a piece of this pig and put it in a butty with some apple sauce. I never ate such pork, and I can no longer think of Abergavenny without that sweet golden pig swimming into view. </p> <p>In the castle grounds there was a cocktail bar in a tent on the lawn, and home made ice-cream with sheep's milk - and an engaging couple of slatterns (yes, that is the word), who, over an open fire were cooking food from the middle ages in flagrant violation of every health and safety directive ever issued. Mostly blackberries and gruel, it was.

  "<p>This month has been a disappointing one for fans of horror games. <a href=\"http://www.doom3.com/\">Doom 3</a> promised to be the most terrifying of all time, but merely took us back to a world of scary monsters and haunted houses. For all its admittedly impressive graphical technology, the game design can only be seen as reactionary compared to the surreal psychological horrors offered up by Konami's <a href=\"http://www.silenthillheaven.com/Site/Main/main.php\">Silent Hill</a>, Tecmo's <a href=\"http://www.fatalframe.com/\">Fatal Frame</a> or more recently Sony's <a href=\"http://www.forbidden-siren.com/\">Forbidden Siren</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>For several years these Japanese titles have been appropriating themes from mythology, schlock horror movies, expressionist art, traditional ghost stories and countless other media to generate deeply unsettling images and experiences. Even the more mainstream Resident Evil, which, like Doom 3, makes great use of juvenile shock tactics, also explores concepts of body horror and the supernatural \u2013 and as with any zombie movie, it plays on innate human fears and revulsion of our own post-mortem decay. Which is more impressive than throwing a flaming skull at the screen and expecting us to crap ourselves.</p> <p>But now even our favourite Japanese horror series are beginning to let us down. Silent Hill 4, with its emphasis on action, is a pale imitation of its relentlessly weird predecessors which often left you wandering for ages with nothing scarier than radio static to keep you on edge. And <a href=\"http://www.capcom.com/outbreak/\">Resident Evil Outbreak</a> is a joke in Europe, robbed of its key selling point \u2013 online co-operative play - which would have allowed gamers to explore the tense self-destructive group dynamic that has formed the basis of American horror cinema from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre right through to modern wannabes like Cabin Fever and Wrong Turn. Interestingly, Resident Evil 4 \u2013 perhaps influenced by those two recent movies - seems to be ditching zombies in favour of inbred yokels as the baddie of choice. Is Capcom looking to study metropolitan fears of rural folk? Or is this an attempt to push the series even further into the mainstream by providing more recognisable enemies? Perhaps the survival horror genre is simply morphing into the currently more in-vogue stealth shooter. That really <em>would</em> be a nightmare. What next? Resident Evil: Vice City?</p> <p>If this shift toward action and away from suspense and psychological horror proves pervasive, it will be a real loss. Videogames have a unique capacity to explore fear. Through their very interactivity they force us into a closer relationship with the hero and his/her situation \u2013 and unlike with movies, we can't hide behind the sofa when we're guiding Claire Redfield, we can't shout at the idiot character for going into the cellar alone, because <em>we're</em> the ones pushing them down there. And with forty hours of game play available in which to manipulate the audience, the videogame designer has a much larger canvas to work with than the horror movie director.</p> <p>The game developer can also use peripheral detail much more effectively than the movie director, knowing that the audience \u2013 able to explore at will - will have time to notice everything. In Silent Hill 2, for example, there are walls daubed with blood, strange signs on hospital walls, viscera in the toilet bowl \u2013 the gamer has time to notice them all, gorging on atmosphere. With the stylistically comparable movie, Se7en, the viewer could only hope to catch a tiny minority of the ambient horrors David Fincher litters in each scene without recourse to multiple viewings.</p> <p>There's far too much potential in the videogame format, then, for horror to slip entirely out of the developers' canon. Fortunately, there are signs that designers are finding new ways to scare, and new dark themes to explore. Free Radical Design's stealth adventure <a href=\"http://www.codemasters.co.uk/secondsight/\">Second Sight</a> plays with para-psychological horror via its hero John Vattic who has violent telekinetic powers \u2013 recalling seventies shockers like Carrie and The Medusa Touch. And of course Rockstar's Manhunt \u2013which on the surface appears to be just a pointlessly violent action adventure \u2013 is all about moral horror: it puts us into extreme situations and asks, 'how far will you go?'. Like Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness it wants to know what happens when the restraining bolts of culture and social ethics are removed from the average person. When we step into the shoes of James Earl Cash we're testing our primal instincts, staring into the id and whatever horrors it holds.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Midway's <a href=\"http://www.thesuffering.midway.com/\">The Suffering</a>, set in a haunted prison, made a rather cack-handed attempt to explore themes of madness and paranoia. It could have been so much better and surely there is a rich mine of material here. Imagine a game where the lead character faces a descent into madness, where anything you see on screen could be a paranoid hallucination \u2013 imagine an interactive version of Jacob's Ladder, The Shining or David Cronenberg 's Videodrome. On the subject of Cronenberg, the concept of <a href=\"http://body-horror.wikiverse.org/\">gruesome metamorphosis</a> as explored in his late-seventies parasite movies Rabid and Shivers would make great material for a videogame. We glimpsed these ideas occasionally in Vivendi's very good translation of The Thing with its scenes of man to monster transmogrification. Expanded to become the main gameplay focus, I can imagine a survival horror romp where you control a character who must locate some sort of antidote to reverse a Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde-style mutation. If nothing else, it would be a potent comment on, and analysis of our current obsession with cosmetic surgery.</p> <p>The Thing, by the way, also used a trust/fear meter to represent the psychological state of the characters - an interesting concept that forces you to worry about your avatar on both a mental and physical level. A similar concept appears in Capcom's <a href=\"http://www.capcom.com/xpml/game.xpml?gameid=750020\">Clock Tower 3</a>, where lead character Alyssa suffers blurred vision and becomes almost uncontrollable when her panic meter rises to maximum, a very compelling attempt to simulate the subjectivivity of mental anguish. Gamers are used to having absolute trust of, and control over, the lead character, so to have this umbilical connection severed, even momentarily, causes quite a psychological jolt (see also the simulation of temporary deafness and blurred vision in Rainbow Six when your soldier strays too close to a bomb blast).</p> <p>So the big horror franchises are going off the boil, but there are interesting ideas bubbling underneath as developers play with the latest graphical and visual technologies to simulate alternate mental states and to explore new themes. Where will they look for narrative inspiration next? In the current climate of real world horror \u2013 of terrorism, protest and natural disaster \u2013 what need have we for zombies and psychological demons? Are videogame developers merely pausing and adapting to exploit topical themes and real-life terrors? Videogames with suicide bombers, corrupt politicians, hospital super bugs, alcohol-fuelled violence, refugee camps, ethnic war\u2026 The horror. The horror.</p>",
  "<p>While observing the natural world there are certain moments when all conversation stops and you are astonished at what is before you. </p> <p>On this trip ours came high over Wadi Rum where the desert vista seen from our balloon at 5,000ft seemed to test our perception of reality. On the ground it appears as an unearthly landscape, like a piece of the moon that has broken off, but here from our silent floating craft, the craggy, vertical rockfaces jutting out from the gentle sand dunes merged into one. </p> <p>Our reverence was broken by a skydiver, who had hitched a lift in our balloon, as he had decided this was his moment to leap. Within seconds, he disappeared into the mural of rock and sand until his canopy opened and he drifted to the earth. Our moment of destiny was upon us, too. With only three of us aboard, the former world champion pilot told us we were too lightweight for a smooth landing and the basket would be dragged horizontally - \"part of the fun, but hang on\", he said. I was torn between wanting to protect Arthur and filming his reaction, but somehow managed both. </p> <p>Once on the ground, Mazied, our Bedouin guide, took us back to the village of Rum where he lives with his wife and six children. Many of the Bedouin with families now live close to schools, electricity and running water, and only venture out to their desert tents occasionally. </p> <p>As we long to be beside the seaside, the Bedouin long for nights under the stars tending their goats and camels; however, a four-wheel drive makes it much easier to get there. As Arthur and I were looking for a real desert experience, Mazied and the whole family treated us to a weekend of Bedouin life. A goat had been bought for $50, an attractive plump animal with curly ears, which was to be our special feast. This required a skilful slaughter by Mazied in his makeshift abattoir, and the death, skinning, degutting and final eating of the little beast was in Arthur's words \"interesting and disgusting\". </p> <p>The next day we visited a very old Bedouin man who remembered Lawrence of Arabia fighting with the Arabs against the Turks during the first world war. He also told us of Bedouin law and how recently when one man had killed another and was caught, his relations, all 100 of them, had to pack up and leave the area perhaps never to return. Arthur also spoke to 16-year-old Thoreya, a girl who had learnt perfect English from all the tourists she had met. She showed him some ancient inscriptions and warned him of dangerous snakes that lurk in crevices. </p> <p>And she was right. Later in the day as we climbed through a canyon to reach a peak to watch the sunset, we saw a cobalt blue-grey viper slithering away to hide under a rock. It was probably more frightened of us than we of it, but all the same it was deadly. </p> <p>That evening, Arthur and I were left alone by the campfire as the family returned to the village. As we contemplated where we actually were in the world - Iraq to the east, Saudi Arabia to the south, Israel to the west - it all seemed far too peaceful here. </p> <p>Jordan is part of the Holy Land where Islam and Christianity began. Jesus and Mohammed might have slept in this very spot. It is also where Richard the Lionheart fought in the crusades. And yet in the silent, timeless desert none of the conflict that surrounded us, both past and present, made any sense. </p> <p>At dawn the next day, we set out on a mini expedition in search of evidence of ancient civilisations, our progress tempered by stomach gripes, the result of the previous day's feasting. We found nothing of human remains but did come across an extraordinary rock archway formed by the wind and sandstorms over thousands of years. </p> <p>By midday, we had left the desert and were travelling in our hire car to the coastal resort of Aqaba, the only place in Jordan on the coast. If you come here, a dive on the coral reef is almost obligatory and worth the effort, even if you have never dived before. </p> <p>Our next destination was the ancient city of Petra, built in 400BC by the Nabataeans, an industrious Arab race who dominated the trade routes of ancient Arabia. The archaeological remains begin at the end of a Siq, a long narrow gorge, and the first glimpse of the Treasury, a temple carved out of the rockface is genuinely breathtaking. In Arthur's eyes, its status increased by the fact that Indiana Jones escaped many well laid traps to reach here in Raiders of the lost Ark. As with Machu Picchu in Peru, Petra was a lost city until someone from \"the west\" discovered it. </p> <p>The number of visitors to Jordan's most popular tourist site rise and fall depending on the various skirmishes taking place on the country's borders. But this is a peaceful country and it is quite safe to travel independently and make your own travel arrangements - although it may be worth finding a tour operator to book a hotel for you as they can often negotiate a better rate. </p> <p>We made our way to the lowest place on the earth's surface; that is, the lowest point below sea level, which also happens to be a sea. It is one of those facts everyone seems to know - you can float in the Dead Sea. The good thing about travelling with a 12-year-old is that they don't know everything and this was a novelty to be exploited. In countless television programmes the \"classic shot\" is the presenter reading the newspaper while floating. Unfortunately, Arthur could only find a copy of Le Monde. </p> <p>Apart from one night of luxury in the new Marriot resort hotel overlooking the Dead Sea, the rest of our time was taken up with flying visits to: Mount Nebo, where Moses is buried; Madaba, where the mosaics come from; Amman, the capital and an affluent Middle East city with thriving markets and plenty of history. </p> <p>There are many other interesting places to visit - Jeresh, for example, in northern Jordan, one of the best preserved Roman towns in the world. If you hire a car, the King's Highway - the main road running through the country - is dotted withcrusader forts, and the road to take if heading south. If you are returning to the capital and looking for spectacular scenery, take the road in the far west of the country that leads to the Dead Sea. </p> <p>Jordan is a friendly country, perhaps the legacy of King Hussein who was always striving for peace and promoting reasonable human behaviour. By all accounts his son King Abdullah is doing a good job, too. It is also a great destination for a school or cultural group looking for a mix of adventure, natural history and hands-on educational discovery. </p> <p>Arthur has travelled a lot and like every young person wonders about the mystery of his existence; he has seen many people praying to all kinds of Gods and yet the world is still full of atrocities, sometimes in the names of those Gods. Jordan is, geographically at least, in the eye of the storm - a good place to contemplate the meaning of life. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Arthur's Trip will be shown on Channel Five tomorrow at 10.35am.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><strong>Getting there:</strong> Royal Jordanian Airlines (020-7878 6300) flies Heathrow-Amman from \u00a3428 inc taxes.

  "<p>I get up before dawn and drive east, across the Colorado River and into the sprawl and billboard landscape of Yuma (\"Foxy Vegetables Welcomes You!\", \"Visit The Yuma Territorial Prison\"). The motel parking lots are empty. The trailer parks and RV camps are deserted, all 300 of them. In summertime the population of Yuma shrinks by 50%, from 120,000 to about 60,000. </p> <p>I was here in January and the city, if that is the right word for it, was clogged and seething with nomadic retirees in motorhomes - \"snowbirds\", as the locals call them, a term that describes their southerly migration in winter and hints at their white plumage. There were vibrant encampments on these abandoned lots, a chirpy, wholesome, neighbourly, Eisenhower-generation feeling in the air - golf clothes and cocktail parties, bridge tournaments and shuffleboard contests, coffee klatches and quilting bees - and it is strange and eerie to see all of it gone, all of it evaporated by the heat. </p> <p>Towards the end of March, as the temperature climbs into the nineties, the spirit of migration moves through the flock. They pack up their satellite dishes and cocktail shakers, roll up their Astroturf lawns, and point the RVs north, chasing the perfect 80-degree day up and down the continent. The Mexican fruit and vegetable pickers, who work the irrigated farms around Yuma, have gone north too, chasing the harvest, and so perhaps have the troubadours and low-rent prostitutes who used to appear at their camps on payday. </p> <p>At the edge of the farms there is a line of transition. The bright, garish, incongruous swath of green ends at the last irrigation canal, and the native buffs, duns, tans, greys, khakis and pinks take over. Linear, rectangular space gives way to smooth, untrammelled space - nomad space - wide flat desert valleys and isolated, sawtoothed mountain ranges, with stands of tall, armed saguaro cactus growing on their flanks and foothills. The valleys measure 20 or 30 miles across, and out in the middle of them there are whirling columns of dust, raised up by the wind, spinning counter-clockwise like miniature tornadoes. They twirl and undulate and skid across the valley floors, gathering speed, until they blow apart and disappear, and another dust devil forms somewhere else. </p> <p>Nomad space: too far from the river to irrigate, too dry for crops or cities to take root. Like the deserts of the Bedouin, the Mongol steppes, the Tibetan plateaus or the buffalo plains, this is a harsh, marginal, wide-open landscape, with long horizons and a paucity of water. This was the homeland of the Sand Papago, or Hiaced O'Oodham as they called themselves, the last freeroaming hunter-gatherers in the lower 48 states to be brought to heel, at the close of the 19th century. Fifty years earlier this had been the westernmost range for the Western Apache raiding parties, attracted by the emigrant caravans travelling to the California goldfields. This, on the evidence of dust devils, is a place where the earth itself feels compelled to rise up and move. </p> <p>Even today, with the richest, most powerful, and most technologically advanced nation state in history behind it, sedentary civilisation has gained little more than a toehold on this stretch of desert. Every 30 miles or so, the interstate will reach a flyblown gas station, with a noisy air-conditioner and a few ramshackle trailers parked around it - a settlement dependent for its existence on passing travellers. I get stranded in one of them (Sentinel, Arizona) for two and a half hours, because the proprietor is sleeping off a hangover and my tank is close to empty. I consider waking him up and reconsider when I see the National Rifle Association stickers on the door, the scrawled promises in red ink to shoot all intruders and the scrawled boasts about intruders already shot. </p> <p>'Why would anyone want to live out here?\" wonders a Californian truck driver, stranded in the same predicament. Apart from a few surly outcasts, huddled around their air-conditioners and beer coolers, modern Americans, like Sand Papagos or Apaches, treat this desert as a place to be travelled across, a place where it feels wrong to be stationary. At 10.15, when the grizzled, wincing proprietor finally appears, driving the 50 yards between his trailer and the gas station, the temperature is already 100 degrees in the shade and rising steadily. </p> <p>Further east, as the interstate approaches Tucson, the mountain ranges grow taller and more impressive, rising up out of the desert to 8-9,000ft now, with a dark green mantle of pine forest around their summits. When storm systems track across southern Arizona, these \"sky island\" mountain ranges capture most of the precipitation, leaving the deserts around in a rain shadow. The mountains release water to the deserts as snowmelt and run off, encased within the banks of unreliable rivers and streams. </p> <p>The same process has shaped the geography of the American West as a whole: the Great Plains might also be described as the rain shadow of the Rocky mountains. The Mojave and the Great Basin desert in Nevada and Utah lie in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada.The arid plains of eastern Washington and Oregon are created by the rain-hogging Cascades. </p> <p>When it does rain on the deserts or the plains, it tends to be dramatic and unpredictable: a thunderstorm boiling up and dumping its contents on a small, localised area of land, rather than blanketing the whole region in rain. Grazing springs up in one place and shrivels away in another. Dry gulches roar into flash-flood, then return to dust and sand. Capricious rainfall patterns, temporary shifting zones of vegetation, seasonal temperature extremes, farflung and unreliable water sources - these too are characteristics shared by nomad lands all over the world. Historically, these were the lands ceded to the nomads by the emerging sedentary states, and nomadism was the logical way to stay alive on them. </p> <p>I think this type of landscape still activates the human desire for travel and mobility on some deep instinctual level, but I don't know how to prove it, and there are certainly exceptions. I think that's what happened to me in the American West, but I'm aware of other factors and more plausible explanations. </p> <p>A fascination with deserts and wandering tribes, for example, has been a recurrent phenomenon among the misfits of European civilisation, and among a certain class of well-educated Englishmen in particular. \"A part of their brain reflects the desert perfectly,\" writes Michael Ondaatje in The English Patient. \"The English have a great hunger for desolate places,\" says Alec Guinness playing a Bedouin chief in Lawrence of Arabia. I'm not about to compare my ramblings around the American West with the epic feats of T E Lawrence, or Doughty, Philby or Wilfred Thesiger, but I think I understand the compulsion that drove the English Arabists out into the deserts and the company of nomads. I think I know why they felt so restless and claustrophobic in England. </p> <p>Travel was in my family too. I come from imperialist stock: the Britons who wanted to get the hell out of Britain. My father, my paternal grandfather, and his father before him were Scottish by blood but born in India, Anglicised by the Raj, and they probably encountered some of my mother's English relatives at colonial functions and banquets. I was born in Malaysia, where my father made a good show of settling down after travelling across most of the world in his twenties. Then we moved to Kuwait, made extended visits around the Middle East before \"coming back\" to England, a country that was entirely foreign to me and reluctant to give me citizenship. My nationality was filed under \"Miscellaneous\" at the British Passport Office. </p> <p>It is a dreary, commonplace adage among the sedentary and stay-at-homes that people travel to escape from themselves. There is some truth in the old cliche, as there is in most, but if you spent your childhood on the move and with the big proviso that you and your family had a happy time doing it - then moving on feels the right and natural state of affairs, and assumes an air of inevitability. It's when you get stranded in one place for too long, at least in my case, that you start to feel divorced from yourself. Setting out on a journey, almost invariably, I have a sense of becoming whole again, of doubts and confusions lifting, and my self slotting back into place. </p> <p>I remember my childhood as a happy time, but my father started suffering from periodic depressions after we \"came back\" to England, and as I recall they usually coincided with the onset of winter. I knew about the English winter - the damp cold in your bones, the afternoon dark, the driving rain in your face, as if the elements had singled you out for persecution - but through the shielding efforts of my parents I knew very little about the downturns and redundancies at the office and the steady decline of the British shipbroking business, to which my father had attached his fortunes. </p> <p>I did notice that my father was restored to his old self, at least temporarily, by going on a trip to some sunny foreign country or other. He returned from abroad in fine spirits, with presents and stories to tell, and old reminiscences sparked - his time as a lumberjack in British Columbia in the 1940s, his heiress-hunting escapades in San Francisco in the 1950s, the old gambling, golfing, cocktail swilling days in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, the anecdotes and adventures from Spain, Italy, Mexico, Montreal, Vancouver, Cape Town, Burma, Indian, Ceylon, Thailand, the Philippines. Listening and watching, as the rain lashed the window panes, and my father told his stories and twirled his Scotch-and-water, it was clear to me that everything vivid and exciting in life happened in other countries. At no stage in my upbringing did it occur to me that I would live in England once I was old enough to leave. </p> <p>My urge to travel, and travel towards the sun, was foursquare in the family tradition, but the style of my travels, I suspect, included an element of rebellion against my background. I wasn't hunting tigers in India with a troop of native bearers and telling the story over a gin-and-quinine cocktail at the governor's mansion, like my grandfather. I wasn't chasing debutantes and craving a life in high society, like my father. I was slumming it around the redneck hinterlands in grubby jeans, hitch-hiking and riding freight trains, drinking in roadhouses and dive bars, sleeping in cars and flopping in the dirt. Growing up in houses filled with nice objets (Persian rugs, Chinese altar tables, antique silverware), and bombarded by consumerist advertising in Thatcher's London, I took pride in being able to carry my worldly possessions and replace them for less than $200 if necessary. </p> <p>To wake up by the side of the road somewhere, light a cigarette, and start pondering the decision of whether to set off north, south, east or west ... To be sitting in a New York bar and fall prey to a sudden urge to go to Texas, Montana or Mexico, and be able to leave in the morning without a care - this was my idea of freedom, this was my definition of success in life.</p> <p><strong>What the judges said </strong></p> <p>'Ghost Riders is about the strange world of thousands of nomadic American eccentrics,by a youthful author who shared their lifestyle.

  "<p>On the last day of August, a familiar scene unfolded in Bounty Bay, Pitcairn Island. A supply ship arrived after a 10-day sail from New Zealand, the nearest landmass, and anchored a mile offshore - the island has no harbour. Pitcairn's men heaved the longboats down the slipway into the jittery water. The South Pacific surrounding this mile-by-mile-and-a-half crag of dark, volcanic rock is rarely still. The previous supply ship, a month earlier, had been unable to stop long because of fierce storms and huge swell, and sailed on, carrying most of the cargo with it.</p> <p>But on this rare calm day, the longboats aligned themselves against the side of the ship and a rope ladder was thrown down from the deck high above. The men scrambled on board and began to lower the cargo over the side, taking care in the pitching open sea not to damage any supplies as they banged and banged against the steel ramparts of the ship. Among the regular goods - sacks of flour, drums of cooking oil, boxes of basic medical supplies, barrels of fuel - was a large consignment of high wire fencing and massive steel gates. </p> <p>\"It looked so sad, and it was difficult to hold back the tears as I saw these items arrive on our island home,\" writes Mike Warren, one of the Pitcairn men working the longboats. The wire fencing and steel gates were for a new development on this remote outcrop. Pitcairn is building a prison.</p> <p>Next week, seven Pitcairners - almost two-thirds of the men on the island, from a total population of fewer than 40 - will go on trial for sexual offences ranging from gross indecency and indecent assault to rape. The accused - Jay Warren, Dennis Christian, Len Brown, Terry Young, Dave Brown, Steve Christian and Randy Christian - face 96 charges between them. All are against children who are now adults. </p> <p>These seven men are among the stalwarts of the community. Steve Christian, 52, is mayor of Pitcairn. He's a good mechanic, able to fix the all-terrain three-wheel motorbikes, Pitcairn's only form of transport, and start the tractor's engine when no one else can. He is also the island's dentist, having done a three-month dental course in New Zealand many years ago; he can only do extractions. His family home - known as Big Fence - is the largest on the island, and his family is the chieftain tribe. Steve is a good leader, a rare skill on an island where people are reluctant to tell others what to do. That is why he always captains the most powerful of the two longboats. His son Randy, 29, the youngest of the accused, has recently had a baby with his wife Nadine. He is chairman of the island council's internal committee. </p> <p>Best friends Dennis Christian, 47, and Terry Young, 43, a descendant of mutineer midshipman Edward Young, are rarely seen at a longboat's helm. Both are quiet and, unusually for Pitcairn, unmarried. For many years, Dennis has acted as the island's postmaster; Pitcairn stamps are collector's items. </p> <p>Dave Brown, 46, nicknamed the Mouth because he shouts when he talks, whose wife and two children also live on Pitcairn, is Len Brown's son and the brother of Olive, Steve's wife; Len, 76 and the oldest defendant, is the island's best fisherman, catching fafaye, hoo-oo-oo and nanwe from the rocks, or giant wahoo and kingfish from the flat-bottomed canoes. </p> <p>Jay Warren, 45, a family man with three adult children and eight grandchildren, who long served as island magistrate, faces the most minor allegation - putting a hand down a girl's bikini in Bounty Bay, before she swam away.</p> <p>Some of these accused worked alongside the remaining island men to bring ashore the ominous load in the longboats. They loaded the rolls of wire fencing and steel gates on to the back of the island's only tractor, driving it up the unpaved path, known as the Hill of Difficulty, which leads up the steep cliff from Bounty Bay to Adamstown, a scattering of simple houses and the island's only settlement. They have already built three cells of the remand centre in which, if they are found guilty, they could be imprisoned; a further three are under construction. New security lighting flooded the area. It just remained for the prison perimeter to be erected. </p> <p>The decision to proceed to trial had been made less than three weeks earlier, 3,300 miles away in court number nine, Auckland District Court. Outside was a drizzly New Zealand afternoon; inside, the courtroom was a little piece of Pitcairn. In recognition of the court's unique legal status, on one side of the judge's bench hung a union flag and on the other the dark blue Pitcairn flag. Pitcairn is Britain's last overseas territory in the Pacific, with a governor, who is also British high commissioner to New Zealand and resident in Wellington; Pitcairners hold British passports.</p> <p>That hearing was Pitcairn's last chance to extricate itself from British justice. The defence team had previously argued that the trials could not continue because, despite Pitcairn's status as an overseas territory, Britain did not hold sovereignty over the island. The inhabitants were descendants of \"pirates and traitors\", men who mutinied against Captain Bligh on HMS Bounty in 1789 and fled to Pitcairn Island to escape the gallows. The mutineers, together with the Tahitian women they took with them, had settled the uninhabited island (which was incorrectly charted and therefore extremely difficult to find) and set their ship alight. By this act of rebellion, the defence argued, the islanders were declaring themselves a rebel state, free from British control.</p> <p>The decision to go to trial has repercussions beyond the fate of the seven accused. Since its founding, Pitcairn has been perceived as an earthly paradise. </p> <p>Walter Brodie, shipwrecked on the island in 1850, wrote that it was \"the realisation of Arcadia, or what we had been accustomed to suppose had existence only in poetic imagination . . . There is neither wealth nor want, a primitive simplicity of life and manner, perfect equality in rank and station, and perfect content.\" Pitcairn was paraded as proof of the possibility of redemption. Four Hollywood movies have been made about the mutiny, each Fletcher Christian - from Clark Gable to Mel Gibson - a portrait of youth and hope, striking out for freedom. </p> <p>The legend lives on, or admirers of the island would like to think it does. Organisations such as the Friends of Pitcairn and the Pitcairn Islands Study Centre condemn the British government for pursuing the case. For, even if all the accused are acquitted, Pitcairn's idyllic image will be shattered. The islanders' sexual practices will be picked over in open court. Whatever the verdicts, the stain of those accusations will remain. </p> <p>Pitcairn's fall began in the late 1990s, when an allegation of rape was made by a visitor to the island on behalf of his daughter. Two officers with Kent county constabulary, Detective Superintendent Dennis McGookin and his colleague Detective Sergeant Peter George, were sent 12,000 miles to Pitcairn to investigate. They were the first British police officers ever to set foot on the island. Although the rape case was dropped and a caution concerning underage sex given, McGookin was disturbed at what he found: \"At the time I was given the job, everyone was very jealous,\" he said, \"but when I came back and told my colleagues stories of what really went on there, their attitude changed.\" His report for the Foreign Office detailed alcohol-related and violent crime, and a general carelessness with firearms. He concluded: \"The islanders need to get their act together or someone is going to get killed.\"</p> <p>Two years later, PC Gail Cox, a community police officer from Maidenhead, sailed to Pitcairn. The Foreign Office and police maintain that Cox's intended role was to train the Pitcairners to police themselves, and that she stumbled across further allegations of sexual abuse against minors. In any case, in November 1999, two girls told Cox they had been abused. The police had an obligation to investigate the alleged incidents, and also to establish whether they were part of a broader pattern. Operation Unique was launched.</p> <p>Police officers sought out and interviewed female ex-islanders dispersed over three continents. They uncovered disturbing stories, some involving children as young as three, some stretching back more than 40 years. There were two explanations. Either these stories were the result of an over-zealous trawling exercise by the officers, and were unfounded. Or they revealed a secret history of the systematic abuse of Pitcairn girls over four decades.</p> <p>Much of the responsibility for weighing them up fell to Simon Moore, New Zealand crown solicitor, appointed Pitcairn's first public prosecutor in April 2000. He had to make a judgment whether it was in the public interest to prosecute. \"How could I make the decision sitting at my desk in Auckland?\" he said when I met him in August. In the end, he sailed to Pitcairn, together with another member of the legal team and Karen Vaughn, a New Zealand police officer specialising in investigating child sexual abuse.</p> <p>Moore admitted that his reception from some islanders was \"chilly\". Others, however, were \"courteous\", delivering bunches of bananas to his room. He held a public meeting in the wooden courthouse on Adamstown Square, only ever used for community events before, asking the islanders what should be done for the best. \"We spoke with just about everyone, and got a range of views, from, 'This is the worst thing that could ever happen' to, 'Yes, you must prosecute.' We weighed them up and thought about it very anxiously,\" said Moore. He decided to recommend prosecution.</p> <p>In April 2003, preliminary hearings began in the courthouse: it was to be the first trial in the island's two-century history. The lawyers, including Simon Moore and Paul Dacre, who had been appointed Pitcairn public defender, shipped in from New Zealand, were dressed in black gowns, bar jackets and lawyers' bibs. The Pitcairners wore T-shirts, usually bearing a picture of the Bounty and the words Pitcairn Island, as if they were all members of the same team. Moore read out the 96 charges of sexual offences against the seven Pitcairn men. Further charges were also laid against another six former islanders - four in New Zealand, one in Australia and one on Norfolk Island, where many Pitcairners live. Extradition proceedings to Pitcairn have been initiated.</p> <p>Prosecution was never going to be easy. \"It's been very difficult to keep the complainants on board. The police have been working round the clock to keep them,\" said Moore. By the time charges were laid, two of the complainants had withdrawn. A further eight prepared a petition, claiming the police had browbeaten them into making accusations against the men. A formal complaint was made against police officer Karen Vaughn to the Police Complaints Authority in New Zealand. Kari Young, a Norwegian married to Pitcairner Brian Young, who has spent most of her adult life on the island, claimed that the British government offered women \"compensation if they had stories to tell, whether about themselves or their neighbours\" and \"put pressure on the women to fabricate stories\". When women did come forward to tell police what happened to them, they made it clear from the outset that they did not want their interviews to be used as evidence. A complaint concerning a three-year-old - the youngest alleged victim - also fell. Around 10 complainants remain, all now adults from their early 20s to late middle age. </p> <p>There is still anxiety that some could withdraw at the last minute. Most live in Australia and New Zealand, and will give their evidence by video link, but there are two on the island - \"if they turn up\", as one lawyer said.</p> <p>\"There are no secrets on Pitcairn,\" said Steve Christian, who faces some of the most serious charges. Some Pitcairners argue that everyone knew what was happening on the island: no crime had been committed, it was all a case of cultural misunderstanding. Having sex from the age of 12 is not only legal under Pitcairn law, they say, but common practice throughout Polynesia. It is certainly true that Pitcairners start having children young; one 22-year-old already has four children. It's also common for a woman to have her first child by one man and her second by another, who will nevertheless willingly adopt her firstborn as his own. </p> <p>But deputy governor Matthew Forbes, who is in day-to-day charge of the island, though based in New Zealand, believes this argument belies the seriousness of some of the charges, suggesting it is a question of teenagers behind the bike shed. \"We're talking about offences against children at quite a young age, and I don't accept that that's a cultural norm on Pitcairn or in Polynesia,\" he said. Thirty-one of the charges are for rape. At least one involves two men pinning down a minor; another placing a penis inside a five-year-old's mouth.</p> <p>I spent four months on Pitcairn Island in 1991. During my stay, I witnessed how the division between rumour and reality can become hopelessly blurred. Living in such a confined place, with nowhere to escape to except the open ocean, Pitcairners avoid conflict at all costs. \"They're frightened of retribution,\" Rick Ferret, who was then the Seventh Day Adventist missionary on the island, told me. \"They're scared that if they say something against someone, they'll get back at them at some later date. You rely on everyone, every day, for your life - in the longboat, climbing the ladder. You just can't walk away from things here.\" </p> <p>Whether someone plucked a fruit from your orange tree without your permission or slept with your wife, you would never directly confront and accuse them. Instead, the aggrieved would tell someone, who would tell someone else, who would very likely tell someone else, who would tell the offender the nature of their transgression. </p> <p>I remember one very small example of how this worked. I was staying with Dennis Christian and his parents when another islander, a teenager, came to visit. Dennis's parents disapproved of smoking, so I was surprised to see Irma, Dennis's mother, offer the young girl an ashtray, insisting she make herself comfortable and light up. The teenager smoked, and Irma nodded and chatted until the teenager left. Irma's two friends, Royal Warren, Len Brown's sister, and Nola Warren, were outside sitting on the veranda weaving pandanus baskets. </p> <p>Then Irma began speaking in their half-18th-century English, half-Polynesian pidgin language known as Pitkern - \"She smoke like a hatchet! This place stink. She ought be larn noot fer smoke [Someone ought to tell her not to smoke].\" Of course, someone would tell her not to smoke - someone to whom either Royal or Nola would relay Irma's words within the next couple of hours. But Irma would never tell her direct. The next time the teenager came round, Irma handed her the ashtray again, smiling as she did so. The bush telegraph had not worked - the girl happily smoked.</p> <p>People would tut-tut about young girls going with older men to Flatlands, a spot where Pitcairners used to build small wooden huts as weekend homes - but always behind their backs. I never heard anyone directly tell anyone else off. Such open disapproval is frowned upon. The word for \"ugly\" in Pitkern is \"angry\".</p> <p> There's a major drawback to this system of dealing with bad behaviour. It's impossible to distinguish between mere rumour, spread out of malice or mischief, and real crimes. The result is that no accusation, however serious, is taken seriously; it can always be dismissed as gossip. And the cost of being seen to point the finger of blame is as great to the accuser as the accused. (It is no coincidence that the first allegation that Det Supt McGookin was sent out to investigate was made by an outsider after he and his daughter had left the island.) If you are a Pitcairner, you'd be pointing at someone with whom you'd have to share this same outcrop of volcanic rock for the rest of your life, whom you would inevitably see every day, and who would probably be a member of your own extended family. In such an atmosphere, abuse can flourish.</p> <p>To understand Pitcairn, you must appreciate Pitcairn's scale. It is small beyond our imaginations. Wherever you are sitting now - at home in a row of houses, in a block of flats, in an office - you will likely be surrounded by more people than there are on the whole of the island. On Pitcairn, you must find a partner among the people within just a few hundred yards of you. \"You don't know what lonely is, not where you're from,\" Dennis Christian once told me. He is not married, but for all Pitcairners romantic and sexual opportunities are extremely limited.</p> <p>Whether they prove to be true or false, these recent allegations will irretrievably change such a small place. \"We are like one family,\" says Betty Christian, 59, a grandmother, wife of Tom Christian, sixth-generation descendant of mutineer Fletcher Christian and elder in the Seventh Day Adventist church. \"Regardless of our differences and problems, none of our people want to see Pitcairn closed down and abandoned. Whatever the outcome, all of us will be affected as we are related to both alleged victims and alleged perpetrators.\" </p> <p>The island used to be governed at arm's length -when I visited, the governor had never set foot on the island. Now, he has a representative in residence, and visits regularly himself. Pitcairn has become the most heavily policed community in the world. Two rotating Ministry of Defence police officers - one sergeant and one constable - are now permanently posted on the island, together with two more investigating officers. Two social workers specialising in child protection are sent out from New Zealand on three-month contracts. Under a new Child Protection Ordinance, they've been given the power to remove a child from its family if they fear for its welfare.</p> <p>Some Pitcairners dub the governor a \"dictator\". They say that they are continually being spied on by outsiders. \"We have enough outsiders here trying to tell us what to do. We still need our pure air to breathe without it being polluted with hem no use sullun comen een [those no-use people coming here],\" Meralda Warren, Jay Warren's sister, writes in the collective email that goes out to the Friends of Pitcairn. </p> <p>Last month, a letter signed \"By Order of the Governor\" was pinned on the public noticeboard outside the courthouse, reminding the islanders that an existing ordinance banned the spreading of malicious rumours on pain of a fine of up to $50. </p> <p>Recently another, handwritten, edict appeared on the noticeboard: \"All guns are to be handed in to myself or the MDPs [Ministry of Defence police] the 7th Sept 04,\" signed Brenda Christian, police officer, Pitcairn Island. (The post of local police officer is rotated between the islanders.) Pitcairners have always carried guns - .22 rifles - which, in their 18th-century vocabulary inherited from the mutineers, they call \"muskets\". They use them to shoot down breadfruit from the trees - the same breadfruit that Captain Bligh came to the South Pacific to gather. Occasionally, they may go hunting for the few remaining wild goats that roam the crags. The Pitcairners feel that the guns are theirs by historical right. But governor Richard Fell, wary of the upcoming trials, said, \"There are going to be some increased tensions. It's going to be quite an emotional time for everyone concerned, so this is to remove increased risk.\" A Pitcairn woman responded, \"We are being treated as if we are a murdering, suicidal bunch of good-for-nothing sex-crazed cowboys.\" Some of the accused have changed their defence lawyers.</p> <p>Many islanders say that Operation Unique gathered the forces of a powerful nation against tiny Pitcairn. \"Britain is treating us all like criminals, like animals,\" said one islander. Kari Young wrote to the governor: \"It never ceases to amaze us that so far you, as its governor, have never shown any compassion for the community or tried to provide fair treatment for the helpless islanders you are supposed to look after, not persecute.\" Along with other islanders, Young claims there is a history of \"restorative justice\" on the island, which could have been used instead, or that a \"truth and reconciliation commission\" could have been established.</p> <p>A few conspiracy theorists think that the British government's real, hidden agenda is to shut down an extremely costly overseas territory. The government, sensitive to this accusation, has planned for all possible outcomes. Applicants for the six posts of prison officers have already been interviewed and arrangements made for their passage to Pitcairn - should any of the men be found guilty. Deputy governor Forbes says that in the event of convictions and custodial sentences, special arrangements could be made to allow any guilty men out of prison under correction staff supervision to help with tasks that the remaining population, robbed of the majority of its adult men, were unable to handle - that is, digging the annual arrowroot crop, cutting cane for molasses, launching the longboats and off-loading supply ships. And if there are no guilty men and no custodial sentences, Forbes says he'll order the bars to be taken from the prison's windows, the wire fencing to be pulled down, and then turn the prison into tourist accommodation. </p> <p>The British government, long negligent of its most distant colonial outpost, is trying to put on a caring face. With no hint of irony, last month the governor's office in Wellington issued a press release titled Good News For Pitcairn. It announced \u00a31.9m in new funding for the island.</p> <p>Instead of another in the line of retired schoolteachers who have previously taken the post, a new-style Pitcairn Commissioner has been appointed - Leslie Jacques, a former merchant banker, who is responsible for administering and developing the island from his office in Auckland. Jacques is drawing up grand schemes for the island's development. His insistent, bright blue eyes shining, he outlines the extraordinary plans he has in mind for tiny Pitcairn. First, money is to be raised by selling the Pitcairn domain name. Then he wants to encourage a cottage industry in honey, producing 20,000 jars a year. \"Japan's greatest delicatessen chain - 74 stores in Japan - has offered to take everything they produce!\" he says excitedly. Jacques has promised the Pitcairners that he will construct a sterile packing plant and sow more pollen-producing flora. He thinks that Pitcairn, despite the difficulties in reaching it, can become an eco-tourism resort, \"now that Antarctica is getting so overpopulated\". \"Staying with the great-great-great-grandson of Fletcher Christian! Americans would pay a lot of money for that,\" he says. Then there's diving, abseiling, rock climbing and \"botanical walks for the less adventurous\". \"Pitcairn has never been looked at as a business model before,\" he says.</p> <p>In return for all this hard work, the commissioner promises 24-hour power on the island; the generator currently provides only a few hours in the morning and evening. He'll install satellite connections in every Pitcairner's hardboard-walled, corrugated iron-roofed home. The island now has a doctor, where before there was only a nurse, traditionally the wife of the Seventh Day Adventist posted to the island from Australia. The Hill of Difficulty will be sealed, so it's no longer treacherous to carry heavy loads up the slippery clay path. There's even a feasibility study under way into providing a landing strip. Jacques's aim is to have former Pitcairners who thought they'd left for ever clamouring to come back, and to quadruple the population to around 150, a figure not reached for more than 70 years. \"My job is to see beyond the trial. There is a future,\" he says.</p> <p>The islanders, bearing in mind that the majority of their men have been charged with sexual assault and may, if found guilty, face long prison sentences, find that Jacques's promises ring hollow. Many point out that the cost of the trial - more than \u00a34m - exceeds any amount of new aid. \"I believe in justice and mercy and forgiveness and reconciliation, but I have never seen so much money being poured into a system that has so far resulted in anything but that,\" says Mike Warren. Jacques concedes, \"That's the biggest challenge - getting the Pitcairners' support.\" </p> <p>Betty Christian, meanwhile, hopes that the upheaval will soon be over. \"I am sure that everyone will be relieved when all this stuff is over and life can really go on the way it should,\" she says. But how can it? The Pitcairners will never again be trusted to pursue their individual way of life. And, if any of the men are found guilty, Pitcairn will be, in effect, a colony where the incarcerators and their associates will be a privileged class: the six New Zealand correction officers, the British police officers and the doctor and his wife will have flush toilets and better built houses, even if they're built by the Pitcairners themselves. A new six-bedded house called McCoys, where the legal teams and social workers stayed, is nicknamed the Pink Palace, as it compares so favourably with the islanders' own homes. And all these would lie close by the six-cell prison, known as the remand centre, and its adjoining police station - the biggest building on the island.</p> <p>The fact is that Pitcairn is already a prison from which nobody can escape. The harsh seas around Bounty Bay hem in the islanders far more effectively than any amount of wire fencing or steel gates. It is this geographical jailing that has always framed the Pitcairners. But now, unlike two centuries ago, this isolation cannot put them beyond the reach of the law.</p> <p>Next week, MV Braveheart will stop off at Bounty Bay, carrying the two legal teams, judges, stenographers, a court registrar, prosecuting police officers from Kent county constabulary, Matthew Forbes, and six members of the media picked to cover the trial. For the first time, outsiders will outnumber adult islanders. The defendants will be heard before three judges; there could be no jury, as there simply aren't enough islanders unconnected to an accuser or accused to fill a jury box. </p> <p>The public prosecutor Simon Moore defends the British government against the criticisms of the islanders. \"I'm not a pom-greaser, but I think the Brits have approached this thing with a level of commitment. The easiest thing would be to have brushed this under the carpet, not do anything. That would be the easiest thing to do. I have nothing but admiration for the British government for having the courage to recognise what the downside is of all this, and to be resolved to carry it out.\"</p> <p>Members of the defence team take a different view, describing Britain's actions as \"a total over-reaction, like Nazis going in there with jackboots on. These people have been ruling themselves for years, then these outsiders come along.\" They have made repeated attempts over the past six months to have the trial delayed or the charges quashed by the Pitcairn Supreme Court and the Pitcairn Court of Appeal, sitting in different borrowed Auckland courtrooms. All have failed. Now, with all other legal avenues exhausted, an application for leave to appeal has been lodged with the Privy Council in London, claiming that Britain has no right to judge Pitcairn, and that Pitcairn should be allowed to judge itself. The application is due to be heard next month.</p> <p>Meanwhile next week's trial will continue. Since the supply ship arrived, some of the accused have been busy building the prison. By now, the wire fencing is erected, the steel gates are in place. The courthouse, its British and Pitcairn flags unfurled, awaits the first hearing </p> <p>\u00a9 Dea Birkett, 2004.<br>Dea Birkett's book, Serpent In Paradise, about her time on Pitcairn Island, is published by Anchor.</p>",

  "<p>Maqsood Akhtar wants to be a nurse. She has set her heart on it. But Ms Akhtar, aged 18 from Slough in Berkshire, could so easily have been lost to the nursing profession. </p> <p>Torn between becoming a doctor and a nurse, she was swayed by a project designed to encourage people from south Asian backgrounds to enter nursing. \"They showed us the video,\" she explains. \"It was just some of the things the nurses said, their experiences, and how they enjoyed it, how they never regretted it. And this made me think this was something I really wanted to do.\" </p> <p>Ms Akhtar, whose family originates from Pakistan, expects to start her degree course in Child Health Nursing next year. But had she decided against becoming a nurse she would have fallen into line with the rest of Slough's Pakistani community. Although around 28% of the town's population are of south Asian origin, mainly Pakistani or Indian, only 2% of recent students doing nursing and midwifery courses at Thames Valley University's Slough campus came from these communities. </p> <p>Professor Elizabeth Anionwu, head of the Mary Seacole Centre for Nursing Practice at Thames Valley University, explains the background to the project. \"In 2001 we recruited about one or two students into nursing and midwifery. There were none coming in, and yet Slough has one of the largest south Asian populations in the country. </p> <p>\"There was something going on here in Slough,\" says Professor Anionwu. \"And the major thing I realised was that we weren't doing local recruitment, and there was a lack of information on nursing.\" </p> <p>The result is the Candles Project, a \u00a3100,000 initiative funded by the local health authority. Launched in October 2003, it is scheduled to continue until autumn 2005. </p> <p>Professor Anionwu, who heads the project, says the aim is to raise the profile of local courses and careers in nursing and midwifery, particularly among the south Asian community in Slough. The project employs an outreach worker whose job includes visits to mosques and temples, as well as the use of customised promotional material, such as a recruitment video, dubbed into Punjabi and Hindi. </p> <p>Ms Akhtar is one of 120 people who have made direct contact with the project during its first 12 months. Of these, three have already been accepted on to Thames University's nursing and midwifery courses starting this autumn. </p> <p>Slow progress maybe. But as Professor Anionwu explains, this is a pioneering work which she hopes will become a model of good practice elsewhere. Under-representation from among the UK's Pakistani and Indian communities on nursing and midwifery courses is not confined to Slough. According to the Department of Health, people from south Asian backgrounds made up 4% of the UK population in 2001. But they comprised 2.3% of applicants to nursing and midwife courses. </p> <p>There are a number of reasons why persuading people from south Asian backgrounds to go into nursing or midwifery is challenging, explains Professor Anionwu. </p> <p>First, there has been no tradition of entering these professions from within these communities, she says. \"If you don't know about it and have no relatives in it, then it is not a career you are going to think of automatically.\" In the Asian family, there is a lot of influence from the extended family,\" explains Haseen Mughal the Candles Pro ject's outreach worker. \"Aunts and uncles and grandparents have a lot of influence over what career path you choose.\" </p> <p>Some people in the south Asian community have yet to grasp what being a nurse in the UK entails, and how it differs from their home countries, she says. At one meeting, a Hindu member of the audience, and a strict vegetarian, expressed concern that his daughter would be expected to serve meat, she says. \"Most probably that is what they do back home in their own country,\" says Ms Mughal. She explains the aim of the project is to correct any such misconceptions, and to provide clear accurate information. For example, these days nursing staff in Slough are allowed to wear both trousers and the hijab. Ms Mughal says that things have come a long way from the days when her family stopped her going into nursing because trousers were not allowed as part of the uniform. </p> <p>Ms Mughal says she has passed on how, by working as a health care assistant in an NHS Trust, they can get into nursing and receive a bursary without the usual requirement of being resident in the UK for three years. </p> <p>\"What I am doing is planting the seed and raising the awareness, giving out the correct information.\" </p> <p>Part of the reason nursing is seen as unattractive is its low status, says Ms Mughal. \"Parents do not see nursing as a professional career in the same category as law, medicine or dentistry.\" </p> <p>Nursing is regarded as a Cinderella profession in Pakistan, and the Pakistani community in the UK holds much the same view, agrees Wasim Khan, a duty manager in a BUPA nursing home in Ilford, and president of the All-Pakistani Nurses Association. </p> <p>\"This applies to someone in my position, extremely motivated and proud to be a nurse. But I'm still called a doctor in my community. I don't want to be called doctor. I am proud to be a nurse.\" </p> <p>There is a stigma attached to nursing, especially for women, and particularly among first and second generation Pakistanis who came to the UK, says Mr Khan. And from a Muslim perspective, there are particular issues when it comes to nursing the opposite sex. \"Being a Muslim, there are some restrictions which I can understand. For example, I don't want my wife or sister having to wash a male stranger even though he is a patient,\" he says. </p> <p>\"There will be question marks over females having to do intimate nursing tasks for males. And there will be some people who decide that nursing is not for them, that it clashes with their religious values,\" says Professor Anionwu. \"Certain people with certain religious values would not see it as respectful for their daughters.\" </p> <p>\"But,\" she adds, \"that doesn't strike me as odd.\" </p> <p>However, she believes it would be a mistake to think that everyone in the south Asian communities holds the same view. It would also be wrong to think that cultural or religious issues are their only concerns. \"Until recently the NHS hasn't had the best track record on promotion prospects for black and ethnic minority members.\" </p> <p>Professor Anionwu is confident that the project will meet it target of recruiting 40 people from South Asian and Caribbean backgrounds on to student nurse and midwifery courses at Thames Valley University by September 2005. \"I totally accept that there are issues within people's cultural backgrounds. But I think that we have to acknowledge that for years we haven't been going into the local communities to talk about these professions,\" she says.</p>",

  "<p>\"Yeah, my legs and the boobs - they're my things,\" muses 20-year-old singer Amy Winehouse as she leans back in the diner booth to admire her aforementioned attributes. The point is somewhat superfluous as both, as she makes clear to the stylist within minutes of her arrival at the fashion shoot, are to be shown off to their proud best for the photos. \"I ain't doing no long dresses!\" she can be heard crying out from behind the dressing room door in her gum-snapping cockney accent, tempered with a teenage lilt. She has an inbuilt radar for finding the items on the overflowing rail that are \"really me\" - namely miniskirts and sexy tops. She picks up an oversized sweatshirt, which, the stylist suggests, could be worn with a pair of H&amp;M cropped trousers. Winehouse disagrees. \"Nahhhh, I'm gonna wear it with just a pair of heels.\" And would Amy like to wear a New Look coat over the evening dress? Amy would not: \"I'm not really a coat kinda person,\" she explains. \"I'm more of a walking-round-without-enough-clothes kinda person.\" It is a fairly safe bet that Winehouse won't be paying too much attention to this season's swerve to the ladylike look. </p> <p>Not that she has ever really followed any trend. Her debut album, Frank, released last year, is a sexy, bluesy shout of protest, not just at her ex-boyfriend who was then her main inspiration (What Is It About Men? is one typical title), but also at the kind of bland baby-baby pop albums we have come to expect from British solo female singers under 30. It promptly went platinum and Winehouse garnered a reputation for being a woman who speaks her own mind. (In one interview, she claimed that her breakfast consists of Jack Daniel's and Coke. But when you are being cited as the Next Big Thing before your 20th birthday, a little self-mythologising is excusable.) </p> <p>Even her looks - as heavily dark as a Goya painting, pretty, but almost too large for her surprisingly small body - defy the current celebrity trend for something more prettily elfin. </p> <p>But Winehouse's attitude typifies something more general. It is one of the more satisfying ironies of fashion that the very people whom the industry adores most - the too-cool-to-even-think-about-school young folk - probably pay less attention to its diktats than most. Aside from the fact that few teenagers have the money to buy into high fashion, they have yet to be convinced that looking In Fashion is sometimes more important than looking good, which in teenage girl-speak translates as one thing only - flaunting it. \"Are you sure you don't want to see my legs?\" she shouts more than once during the shoot. She is much happier when perched on the counter and, within the space of two shots, she can go from looking like a pretty girl enjoying her good looks to a pastiche of an FHM model. \"Let's button up your jumper ... \" is one typical fatherly interjection from the stylist as he tries to keep her looking more like the former. </p> <p>Probably for that reason, Winehouse has little time for stylists or anyone else who tries to control her appearance. The only style adviser she brings to the shoot is her best friend, and she insists on doing her own hair and make-up. \"Why would someone who's only known me for one day know what looks good on me better than I do?\" she asks in a \"like duh \" tone of voice. From the mouths of babes, eh? </p> <p>She does subscribe to Vogue, but usually just flicks through it, finding it all \"really, really ugly. I only ever like the Louis Vuitton bags.\" </p> <p>Of course, she clarifies, waggling a greasy chip for emphasis, she doesn't actually buy Vuitton - \"I'm Jewish, so I'm really into knock-offs\" - instead taking advantage of the increasingly good copies from the local markets. \"I bought this great fake Vuitton a while ago - pink, metallic, but that makes it sound really gross, doesn't it? Also, I like the fake Chanel stuff.\" Not, she quickly adds, somewhat contrarily, that she buys them for the label, but \"just for how they look\". </p> <p>She may claim not to be interested in labels, but she certainly knows her stuff. Her favourites are \"Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs - what he's done at Vuitton is great. And also labels that have a real legacy, like, well, Vuitton again, but also Missoni and Chanel.\" She is equally, and unsurprisingly, clear about which ones she doesn't like: \"Michael Kors and MaxMara - they just look like really bad high street.\" Not that she dislikes the high street - \"I ain't no snob\" - and, being a good north Londoner, she loves Camden Market above all. </p> <p>What about people in the music industry? She approves of Christina Aguilera's newly covered-up style: \"She's a talented girl, but you couldn't really see it before when she was wearing those chaps with her ninny hanging out.\" Madonna, naturellement , also gets a nod: \"I love the way she's so comfortable with her sexuality.\" But in the main, she has little time for so-called style icons, and the idea of copying anyone else's look causes her huge eyes to roll. \"Even Sienna Miller,\" she says, referring to this year's current style icon, as decreed by the tabloids and Heat magazine. \"She's got nice clothes, but she just looks like a high-street poster girl, like, really ready-made. I don't want to be the prettiest or the sexiest or whatever. I just want to look different and to look like me.\"</p>",
  "<b> Isabel Bennett says: </b> \"A face-to-face meeting with staff is vital. The workforce must have an opportunity to ask questions and find out how the change will affect them. An information pack for each employee is key. This should cover issues such as how long they are expected to remain at work, what job-finding support is available from an outplacement consultancy or through the local Job Centres and how the change will affect them financially. It is important to let staff know what their consultation rights are. <p>When making the announcement, don't do it, for example, after the company has posted large profits. Tell managers and team leaders first so that they can answer questions from their teams. Then call the whole workforce together and make the announcement. Give people the chance to ask questions, then give them their individual information pack and let them go home for the rest of that day and read it. </p> <p>The next day, arrange for the HR team to hold meetings with employees and their line managers to discuss details of the severance process. In terms of workers' reactions, I've learned the hard way to expect the unexpected. Don't take this personally, especially if you are also set to lose your own job - you need to look after yourself as well. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Isabel Bennett, is director of learning and development at Vodafone UK. </p> <p><b> Clare Chapman says: </b> \"As jobs are clearly on the line here, there is no pain-free way to break the news, so communicating honestly and providing ongoing support is key. Give your staff as much notice of the situation as possible. Individual letters in the first instance may cause confusion if, for example, the news reaches some employees before others. Letters are an impersonal way of communicating bad news. I recommend a direct approach. Gather the workforce together and give them the facts, then meet with them in small groups. Try to pre-empt the kind of questions that may arise so you can provide answers straight away and avoid frustration or potential confrontation; bear in mind emotions will be running high. </p> <p>Being armed with all the details about redundancy or relocation options should help soften the blow particularly if you can pro vide concrete help. This could mean programmes including access to career advisors, the opportunity for jobs with other employers in the area or help with re-training. </p> <p>Finally, don't forget that at such a difficult time the role of your managers is crucial. They have to lead the process so put thought into how you can equip them to do the best possible job in conveying bad news. You also need to give some thought to how to maintain morale over the final year.

  "<p>In a country as small as ours, the division between town and country is often more apparent than real. There can hardly be anyone who does not enjoy and profit from both. The same is true of the passions aroused by hunting. Neither side will prosper by pretending that its supporters come exclusively from the city streets or from the green fields. </p> <p>There are issues which create genuine conflict between the two, particularly in planning, but even here the two \"sides\" may have more in common than they suppose. A prime example of this will get thousands of enthusiasts out on the bracing moors of the north and the downs of the south tomorrow: the celebration of the country's first two areas to enjoy a largely unrestricted \"right to roam\". </p> <p>There could be no better way of spending a Sunday, even if the reasons for getting a dose of fresh air are less pressing than they used to be. In the earliest days of the open access battle, the issue of health was a desperate matter for those coughing their guts out in Sheffield, Manchester and the other smoky cities of the north. Not surprisingly, much of the steel behind famous protests such as the Kinder Scout mass trespass in 1932 came from communists and socialists. </p> <p>Their opponents, appropriately, included an impressive line-up of dukes, and freedom to roam seemed doomed to be a chronic sore in relations between town and country, an affront to the stout old liberties of freeborn ramblers or a provocation to expert tenders of the gamebird moors. No longer. There are still serious doubts on the landowners' side regarding compensation for damage and insurance liability; these must be taken seriously. But attitudes have undergone a sea-change. The catalyst was foot-and-mouth. That disaster brought deserved sympathy for all who earn a living in the country; but it also won their visitors new rural respect. Walkers understood the restrictions on access - and followed them. The brief experience of a countryside without tourists, however annoying the habits of a minority, also sent economic shivers down rural spines.</p> <p>That is why today's celebrations include landowners as well as ramblers, and why it would damage the countryside as much as the town if the festivities were to be disrupted by the hunting lobby. Sympathetic, knowledgeable friends - and large numbers of them - will do nothing but good for the wild places and those who earn their living there. As Scotland's parallel legislation, in force for over a year, has shown, the visitors see, understand and take the message back to the towns.</p>",
  "<p>The other countryside alliance will take to the fells and moors tomorrow to celebrate the arrival of a new right to roam open land. </p> <p>Walkers will gather at Abbeystead in the Forest of Bowland, Lancashire, and the Goyt Valley in the Peak District, where the law increases land accessible to walkers by 35%. </p> <p>Both areas are typical of the wild, open country which the new law opens up, essentially permitting walkers to leave designated public rights of way and wander at will. </p> <p>The events also include a welcoming contribution from landowners such as Yorkshire Water, which is throwing a joint party with ramblers, and the Moorland Association which has published a new access code with the motto Respect, Protect and Enjoy. </p> <p>Other groups, such the Country Landowners Association, remain cautious about the rights, particularly the possibility of problems over compensation for damage and insurance liability. </p> <p>But there was a consensus yesterday that the issue should be separated from the storm over hunting, although Countryside Alliance protesters are expected to dog the main celebration events. </p> <p>The Countryside Agency and the Countryside Council for Wales, which are supervising plans of newly open areas, are ready for some initial confusion. </p> <p>The new law enormously extends the amount of countryside where walkers may legally go, but is limited to \"mountain, moorland, heath, down and registered common land\". </p> <p>This does not include most cultivated land, largely in lowland Britain, where existing arrangements of public footpaths and permitted access by agreement with landowners or farmers will remain the rule. </p> <p>Other areas exempted include Ministry of Defence ranges, sensitive forestry, specialist farming and some nature reserves. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 does not apply in Scotland, although new legislation there has granted similar rights. </p> <p>Tomorrow sees the new law come into force in the first two of eight \"mapping areas\" organised by the Countryside Agency. </p> <p>The Lower North West covers most of Lancashire, a small part of Cumbria south of the A65, parts of North and West Yorkshire), Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Cheshire, parts of Staffordshire, Derbyshire and South Yorkshire in the Peak District National Park, and parts of north-west Derbyshire that border the park. </p> <p>The South East covers Surrey, Kent, West Sussex, East Sussex, south London boroughs of Hillingdon, Hounslow, Richmond, Kingston, Merton, Sutton, Croydon, Bromley and Bexley. </p> <p>Boundary agreements in the rest of the England and Wales are due to be completed, and access opened by the end of next year. </p> <p>Precise details of the \"access land\" will be shown on 32 new maps being prepared by the Ordnance Survey. The almost four-year delay between the passing of the act in November 2000 and its implementation has been taken up with consultations and provisional maps. </p> <p>The struggle for access goes back to 1884. The campaign's most famous moment came with the mass trespass on Kinder Scout in the Derbyshire Peak in 1932, when ramblers fought pitched battles with gamekeepers. </p> <p>In spite of the length of the struggle, dozens of advances were made along the way, notably the creation of national parks in 1949, with the Peak District the first. </p> <p>\"It will be a truly historic day for the countryside,\" said Nick Barrett, chief executive of the Ramblers' Association which is organising the celebrations in Bowland and the Peak. </p> <p>\"For many the joy of walking is about getting off the beaten track; everybody in this country now has a right to do just that and I hope people will take the opportunity to discover these beautiful areas for themselves.\" </p> <p><strong>These routes are made for walking ...</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> One of the best areas in the Peak District is the Dragon's Back hills south of Buxton, an area with little access land in the past compared with the national park. Tomorrow, fellsides will link Hollins Hill, Chrome Hill, Parkhouse Hill, Hitter Hill and High Wheeldon (route on Ordnance Survey Explorer OL24). The newly open areas connect well with existing rights of way and villages and hamlets once hard to reach due to trespassing law </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In Lancashire, walkers can tramp across the Forbidden Moor - Burn Moor south-east of High Bentham, five miles east of the A65 'Road to the Lakes' past the Three Peaks mountains of the Yorkshire Dales national park. Burn Moor (Explorer 41) can be reached by two roads and a right of way before linking up with vast tracts of upland which, the Ramblers Association says, 'provide magnificent, if challenging walking'. This lies near the Forest of Bowland, where rigorous gamekeeping had made access difficult </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> From the last houses in Sheffield, walkers lose themselves in the wilderness of Hallam, Derwent, Ughill, Bradfield, Broomhead, Midhope and Bamford Moors - one-time scenes of angry confrontations with shooting parties and water companies. The area (OL1) combines sweeping views with traces of industrial and social history </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sussex Downs. Newly open land links Amberley Mount along a north-facing escarpment to Chantry Hill (121). The gentle stretch of grassy hillside follows the South Downs Way between Amberley and Sullington but adds new off-path areas </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A second stretch of down creates access land between Newtimber Hill, Devil's Dyke, Edburton Hill, Truleigh Hill, Tottington Mount and Anchor Bottom (122). Some excellent walks with spectacular views </p> <p><strong>Rules of wider access</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The new right of access is only on foot and allows anyone to walk across newly open land 'for the purposes of open recreation' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Unless existing rights permit it, you are not allowed to take any animal other than a dog, nor to light a fire </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Killing, injuring or disturbing any animal, bird or fish is forbidden. So is damaging birds' nests and eggs </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Feeding of livestock is not allowed, nor is bathing (in non-tidal water), using a metal detector, damaging or removing plants, interfering with drains or sluices and failing to leave gates as you found them </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The law also carries provisions against 'intimidating anyone else engaged in lawful activity', which is designed to prevent confrontations between walkers and shooting parties. The Moorland Association's new visitors' code also asks walkers to 'respect shooting party requests as they will only be short-term' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Camping, organised games and paragliding are banned </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Walkers can find out details of most access land from maps produced by the Ordnance Survey, although not all maps are ready yet. Open access does not begin in some areas until next year </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Control of dogs and other responsible behaviour is governed by the Countryside Code and the Moorland Visitors' Code which emphasise safety, fire prevention, plant and animal protection </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Those interested in the development of open access may attend or apply to join new local forums, made up of landowners, users and other interested parties. Details can be obtained from local authorities.</p>",
  "<b>Dear Mark</b> <br> I've been thinking about the conference in Bournemouth next week. With the media finally accepting we are into three-party politics now, we must be clear where we stand on those two old chestnuts social liberalism and economic liberalism in terms of Lib Dem policy. <p>I don't know what you think, but on that first one, social liberalism, I feel there isn't a big discussion to be had because generally the party is pretty clear about it. I mean, if social liberalism means the state has no right to moralise at its citizens but has to guarantee equal opportunities for everyone, surely members of the party are not going to object.</p> <p>For instance, I think I agree with you on ID Cards - you're against them, right? I certainly hope so - as they seem to epitomise the worst aspects of Big Brother intervention. <br><b>Yours, Lembit</b></p> <p><b>Dear Lembit</b><br> I couldn't agree more: what we are all looking for is for everyone to get good services in a fair way. We don't want a two-tier service where the rich can pay more for better facilities. The question is, how do we make public services better? It's a nonsense to say that all services have to be public or that they all have to be private. Isn't it about both of them working together to provide a free service at the point of delivery?</p> <p>As for ID cards, yes, of course I'm against them, but I feel it important to argue not just on civil liberty grounds; as liberals we should also make the pragmatic case against them. Surely the \u00a33bn that such a scheme would cost could be better spent on intelligence and policing as a way of tackling the crime and terror threat, though let me be clear: the fact that I do not argue against them on civil liberty grounds does not make me any less liberal. I just want to convince as many people as possible of our arguments. <br><b>Yours, Mark</b></p> <p><b>Dear Mark</b><br> I note what you say about ID cards, though I am tempted to try to get you to argue against them on civil liberty grounds. They are appalling in terms of privacy and freedom from state snooping, which after all can be pretty dangerous when individuals who are corrupt find work in the state machine.</p> <p>In terms of public services I do agree that it is right to avoid a two-tier system and make sure that central services such as health, education, and policing are free at the point of delivery. But I do think the party needs to come to a view about the private-public split in terms of providers and service delivery. We cannot run away from this, Mark: people will ask us about it anyway. What think? <br><b>Yours, Lembit</b></p> <p><b>Dear Lembit</b><br> Glad we agreed on ID cards. But on health, we don't have a problem with the beds and the wheelchairs and equipment being made privately; why should it be a problem if some of the buildings and staff are from private companies? Surely what matters is that it is free for everybody and the NHS is the gatekeeper for everyone. But if that's too controversial for the party then maybe we should forget public-private and try to make more of mutuals and the voluntary sector running things.</p> <p>And so far neither of us has talked about how you make these services accountable, so let me really test your liberalism with this. We always assume that having elected politicians brings accountability, but with such low turnout it is hardly very accountable. Maybe we need to find better ways of getting communities involved with running some services themselves. <br><b>Yours, Mark</b></p> <p><b>Dear Mark</b><br> Strong stuff, Mr Oaten. In theory, what you say could work. There is no technical reason why farming it out to private providers or mutuals cannot work. After all, it is, I suppose, a bit dogmatic to absolutely insist the whole thing is state controlled. But I fear that the private sector might create undesirable pressure to cut costs and increase profits. Isn't there a danger that areas of high expense will experience decision-making by accountants while the NHS tends to leave it to clinical practitioners? And are you really saying that you believe the private sector is so much better that what it takes in profit is more than made up for in efficiency savings? I doubt it.</p> <p>While I have no issue with seeing some services from the private sector, if they are great value, allowing people to opt out of the NHS and into private healthcare seems well dodgy: after all, if lots of people do it, it will put pressure on us to downsize the NHS and we will end up depending on the private sector. Market forces would then push prices up. </p> <p>Call me old fashioned, but I would rather pay what it takes to get great services in the NHS than what it costs to go outside. <br><b>Yours, Lembit</b></p> <p><b>Dear Lembit</b><br> Good stuff indeed, Lembit, and I can be convinced of the danger of poor quality service if profit is the main motive. I think doctors and nurses in private hospitals would rightly take issue with you, but on balance I'm convinced by your desire for a cautious approach.</p> <p>Given that I'm moving in your direction on that, how about tackling my point about the dreaded issue of choice and accountability? I think people want a good local hospital, but frankly they don't mind too much who runs it as long as it is free. And what about this question of accountability? Can we find a better system than local councillors to engage the public? <br><b>Yours, Mark</b></p> <p> PS Well impressed you haven't mentioned asteroids yet.</p> <p><b>Dear Mark</b><br> I haven't mentioned asteroids because I don't want to create global panic with what I know. But even in the run-up to Armageddon I still think we need good public services. I am less worried about accountability because I think people will do their best and know what that means without being hectored by government, but I'm not sure what you mean by a better system than local councillors: when I was a councillor in Newcastle back in the last millennium I felt the system worked pretty well and that decisions were generally made sensibly. </p> <p>What I am most worried about is levels of management because what bothers people is all this stuff about red tape and bureaucracy. It is easier to add levels than to trust the experts to manage things for themselves. Maybe here is where we can get the benefit of private sector practice and public sector service at the same time. If the state was competent at identifying the best people in health, education and so on, employing them within the public sector and then negotiating how much it would cost for a given level of service, then surely we would get private sector efficiency without the profit ethos.</p> <p>I think politics should be more confident about employing top quality managers and giving them the resources to manage without fear. Those managers will have an outcomes focus and get the results we want. I think that on the whole Britain's services are not bad. All it would take to make them great is those managers and a willingness by the government to trust them. If the Lib Dems did that, the public sector could apply the best practice from the private sector without the profit motive.</p> <p>If economic liberalism comes to that, then I'm all for it. All it needs is a little bit of insight, enough faith in human nature and a belief that people do their best when they are given the space to give it a go. <br><b>Yours, Lembit</b></p> <p><b>Dear Lembit</b><br> Hear, hear to getting rid of Westminster control and central targets. My point about local councillors is that we have to be careful not to replicate that national control on a local level.</p> <p>I am completely with you on good management. When I visit a hospital, school or prison I can often tell how well it will be run, based on the chief executive, headteacher or governor. Rewarding these people well in the public sector is important, but when it comes to pay we must not ignore the low salary nurses have to start their career on.</p> <p>I think we have found some common ground, and although I'm not convinced about things falling from the sky I am convinced that we will get clarity on this as a party as long as we are willing to discuss it. I'll buy you a drink at conference and let's talk about this in more detail. <br><b>Yours, Mark</b></p> <p><b>Dear Mark</b><br> It's a deal. <br><b>Yours, Lembit</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Lembit Opik MP is the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Wales, Northern Ireland and youth affairs; Mark Oaten MP is the party's chief spokesman on home affairs.</p>",
  "<p>After a 1970s row over sex and/or swearing in a TV play, the dramatist Trevor Griffiths said it was no accident that broadcasting chose the title \"controller\" for its bosses rather than the \"editor\" of newspapers or \"director\" of theatre and film.

Calling the shots from the sofa - in a way previously restricted to specialist vision-mixers in the studio - has been the TV experience of this summer.</p> <p>For the first time, the BBC's Wimbledon and Olympic coverage allowed digital and satellite viewers to watch full matches and events which would once have been reduced to a one-line summary from the presenter of the controller's scheduled coverage on the main channel.</p> <p>Because our present is so routinely futuristic, we have become casual about technological advance. But, sampling eight football games simultaneously on Wednesday night, it struck me that this is as significant a shift in the consumption of television as the arrival of colour, video-recording or satellite.</p> <p>When I was at school, whole hours on the playground were devoted to predictions of which game they would show on television that Saturday: transmission details were censored because of fears of reducing attendance. Later, when the games were freely advertised, there was the bleat about the same four teams always being screened. So choosing between all the available games in a competition feels, to adapt Philip Larkin on 1960s sex, like \"paradise/Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives\".</p> <p>We can see in this summer's sports coverage the likely shape of all future viewing: planning a night's entertainment from numbered lists of programmes on the web rather than newspaper grids.</p> <p>This isn't the total defeat of the Griffiths theory. Writers in television are probably more controlled than ever before, with escalating layers of competing executives standing between a script and its transmission. But viewers are increasingly being offered at least the illusion of self-control, self-scheduling.</p> <p>But, as the Larkin poem reflects, apparent paradise tends to reveal catches when the light changes. This democracy of watching comes at a cost. My eight-game experience this week was only possible because of paying Sky Sports an annual sum that makes the BBC licence fee look like a book of stamps. And the tennis and athletics options on the BBC this summer were only available to those who had paid at least the cost of a digital box.</p> <p>The level of self-control achieved is also obviously relative. What Trevor Griffiths failed to acknowledge in his analysis is that the medium's superintendent tendency was not entirely the result of the personalities and politics of the men who ran the networks.</p> <p>Always more regulated than the press - by law and by the perception that a greater responsiblity rests on a medium which is beamed into people's homes - TV is to some extent required to control: morally, editorially. So, while interactivity will allow the viewer to opt out of the freestyle Olympic swimming chosen to lead BBC2 in favour of the small-bore shooting, it is unlikely that we will ever get to call the angles on a war or an anti-hunting demonstration or choose which depravity to watch in a play set at an orgy.</p> <p>Some digital news channels already allow us to choose heavy or light headlines in the bulletin: drop the euro, go with the dead donkey. And this raises the biggest risk of interactive viewing: that self-control encourages us to drop our standards.</p> <p>As anyone who has tried to buy a child an ice-cream is aware, choice can encourage greed and confusion. The mere knowledge that seven other games were available on Wednesday encouraged me to sample flash-points from all of them rather than appreciate one match properly. If this continues, I will end up knowing a lot less about a lot more football.</p> <p>Though acceptable for sport, the same approach applied to news and factual TV will inevitably lead to serious programmes being ignored or marginalised. The traditional British approach to TV journalism - insisting that every network has a bulletin that should not clash with that of its rivals - was designed to make it hard for a viewer to avoid the news of the day.</p> <p>This trick can be dismissed as paternalistic, but the spread of red-button television makes it easier for an individual to turn their experience of television into a river of trivia. The opening up of broadcasting to the audience may encourage shallow viewing. But eight televised games still feels a kind of paradise.</p>",
  "<p>Rio Ferdinand must soon try to remember how top-flight football is played but his standing has risen with each match he has missed. The other Manchester United defenders, thanks to their profusion of mistakes, have almost by accident turned into a support network, reminding fans of just how much the club have suffered during the centre-back's eight-month ban for failing to attend a drug test.</p> <p>He might return in Monday night's match with Liverpool at Old Trafford. The comeback of Eric Cantona from an FA suspension famously brought an equaliser from the penalty spot against the same club but Ferdinand's task would, in its way, be more demanding. Unlike a striker, he needs an evening of sound judgment rather than a composed moment in front of the opposition's posts.</p> <p>\"I have a major decision to make,\" said Sir Alex Ferguson. \"Manchester United-Liverpool games are often the most serious in the league in terms of history and geography. I can't attempt to win with all the hype being about Rio Ferdinand. He's ready to play. I just have to decide whether it's wise to do it in this game. The crowd could just get a wee bit excited by it. It's a not a bad thing. Whether he could give us a bigger lift coming on as a substitute or starting the game is something I don't know.</p> <p>\"There's no impairment to his physical being but the mental state is the hard bit. He has trained every day but he has been denied the joy of playing. If he was injured he'd know that he couldn't play on a Saturday and there would be a straight line to it. Rio never had any straight lines. So we have had to try and get him to focus on [thinking of this] as an injury.\"</p> <p>Should Ferdinand be included, he is sure to be indifferent to bile and Scouse mockery. This part of his temperament was already probed thoroughly within 48 hours of sentence being passed. Having lodged an appeal, Ferdinand was free to play at Spurs last December. While the physio attended to a knock in that match the spectators gave him the treatment.</p> <p>\"Piss in a bottle, you couldn't piss in a bottle,\" the crowd sang. Undistracted, he performed quite well in a 2-1 win. \"Rio will handle it,\" Terry Butcher, the former England centre-half, said of the impending mockery. \"He plays for Manchester United and that in itself brings a certain amount of abuse from supporters.\"</p> <p>During all the debate over Ferdinand's reportedly feeble attention span in driving away from the training ground after being called for a test, his qualities as a footballer were in danger of being overlooked, but they are uppermost in the minds of professional observers. \"I still think he's the best centre-half in Europe,\" said Harry Redknapp, who gave him his debut at West Ham. \"To have him back in the team, with the pace he has, is going to be vital to United.\"</p> <p>Ferdinand also meets the standards set by a former England captain. \"Rio's quick and he's got long legs that can nick the ball away from an opponent,\" said Butcher. \"He's got balance, height, he's very comfortable coming forward and he reads the game well. He's very much the modern centre-half. \"I think he'll be back to his best pretty quickly. When I was out for the same length of time as Rio it was because I had broken my leg. He doesn't have the fitness problem. He's just has to get the sharpness and match tempo again.\"</p> <p>The enforced interruption to his career came at a galling moment for Ferdinand, who was beginning to settle into his best form after a moderate first season at Old Trafford. On the morning of his last match before starting his sentence, which the team lost to Wolves, United had been top of the Premiership. Four months later the side was trailing in third, 15 points behind Arsenal.</p> <p>United have been bedevilled by more than just the exclusion of their centre-half and a certain tautness seems to have gone out of their performances, but it must enhance them significantly to have Ferdinand and, soon, Wayne Rooney in the line-up. Familiarity with the defender has blinded people to the fact that his talent once made him, in his own way, as much of a prodigy as the teenage forward. Eight years ago he inspired the same covetousness in Ferguson.</p> <p>When West Ham put Ferdinand out on loan to Bournemouth for two months at the end of 1996, his efforts there immediately had lights flashing on United's scouting system, even though they knew so little about his background that they imagined he belonged to the then Second Division team. The club's chief executive was soon redirected by Dean Court officials to the Upton Park manager.</p> <p>\"I told Martin Edwards he wasn't for sale and there was no price because Rio was going to play for England,\" recalls Redknapp. \"They thought they were going to get a bargain but they ended up paying \u00a330m for him.\" Mention of Ferdinand makes a kaleidoscope of memories swirl again in Redknapp's mind. \"We played Wimbledon one day and Rio kept shuffling the ball from one foot to the other without even glancing at it,\" he said. \"He was running at Vinnie Jones, looking Vinnie straight in the eye because he was so confident.\" </p> <p>Although Redknapp, the current Portsmouth manager, was conscious of Ferdinand from the start, the youngster's precocity still took him by surprise. West Ham had lost heavily to Chelsea in the first leg of a Southern Junior Floodlit Cup final and he could not attend the return match. \"Tony Carr, our youth-team manager, must have stuck in one or two of the kids because he didn't really fancy our chances,\" Redknapp mused. \"My dad rang me that night about half-past-ten and said, 'I've just seen the best player I've seen in years.' </p> <p>I was trying to guess who it was and I put a few names to him and he said, 'No, he's called Ferdinand.' I said, 'Ferdinand? He's a schoolboy; he won't have played.'\" Redknapp senior had watched a midfielder with the ball control to embark on long runs past opponents powerless to dispossess him. It is the rounded nature of Ferdinand's gifts that has Butcher wondering if Sven-Goran Eriksson might find a different use for him in a national team that sometimes leaves too much unpoliced space in front of the back four. </p> <p>\"England could be looking to play Ferdinand as a holding midfielder,\" he said. \"I think he's well capable of it and it would make sense when England have quite a few centre-halves available now.\" In a different way Redknapp sees Ferdinand's distribution as crucial to Eriksson's cause. \"If you want to have top-quality football,\" he argued, \"you need people at the back who can play. It's no coincidence that in every great Germany team they took their best passer and put him in defence. It happened with Franz Beckenbauer, Lothar Matth\u00e4us and Matthias Sammer.\" </p> <p>Might England, perpetually losing ground and then the lead, have done better at Euro 2004 if Ferdinand had been there to help them retain possession? \"Absolutely,\" said Redknapp. He is not prepared either to agree that Ferdinand is particularly prone to lapses. \"Rio's a Rolls-Royce,\" he protested. \"It's the same with him as it was with Bobby [Moore]. They're brave enough to come out from the back and try to pass the ball and so they will make the odd, very rare mistake. They shouldn't be crucified for it.\"</p> <p>Ferdinand will be a target for many crowds. At 25, though, he ought to be maturing to dispel any doubts about his concentration. It is up to the defender to make himself loathed by rivals for the impact he has with United and England.</p> <p><strong>How drug policies have changed</strong></p> <p><strong> Football Association</strong> The FA's drug testing policy, already heavily criticised, came under more public scrutiny. It was the determination of the former chief executive Mark Palios to take a hard line on drugs and indiscipline that led to Ferdinand being punished. Palios has now gone and it remains to be seen whether his successor will be as vigilant. </p> <p><strong> Manchester United</strong> The club have considerably tightened their procedures so that any player selected for an out-of-competition test must immediately meet the UK Sport sampling officer after finishing training. </p> <p><strong> UK Sport</strong> It may be a coincidence but the Ferdinand row was followed by the departure of Richard Callicott as chief executive and Michele Verroken as the anti-doping unit head. That has led to UK Sport being less transparent about drug testing after FA complaints that too much information was being included in UK Sport's quarterly report, since scrapped. </p> <p><strong> World Anti-Doping Agency</strong> The Wada president Dick Pound said United were damaging the fight against doping by defending Ferdinand. It was part of his campaign to get Fifa to agree to two-year automatic suspensions. Fifa treats each case individually.</p>",
  "<p>I live a hermit-like existence among the Northern fells, confined most of the daylight hours to a monkish cell making up nonsense and scouring the internet in the vain hope of discovering that somebody has named a species of predatory ant after Juan Antonio Samaranch. </p> <p>My only contact with the outside world comes during my periodic forays to the coal shed when I am halloo-ed by the passing huntsman and his croaking pack. </p> <p>(Observing the way the tide was running on the legislation against hunting with dogs, the hunt in these parts long ago sold off its hounds and bought frogs instead. They chase smaller prey, of course, but nevertheless it has been a spectacular success. There can be no more stirring sight to the Northumbrian than that of red-coated riders and green-backed salientians galloping and hopping o'er moor and dale beneath a full moon on the scent of an oak eggar or hawkmoth, accompanied by the tooting of the horn and the occasional rubbery squelch as a laggard is caught beneath a thundering hoof. </p> <p>Some readers may say it is cruel but rest assured, if you had seen with your own eyes, as I have, the havoc a single moth can wreak when it gets among a flock of tweed sports jackets, you would not feel quite so protective towards them. Hunting with frogs is the only sane way to keep the numbers of moths down, as anyone who has sent a gamekeeper in to rid the wardrobe of the voracious blighters using a 12-bore will testify.) </p> <p>As a result of my isolation I am totally reliant on the mass media for information about modern Britain, poring over newspapers as the classicist might the histories of Polybius. Gore Vidal once observed that the surest sign of what a society considers normal is to be found not in what its citizens comment upon but on what they do not comment upon. If Gore is correct (and when was he ever wrong?), then the reaction to the sending-off of Everton's Tim Cahill on Saturday for pulling his shirt over his head provides an intriguing glimpse into a singular world. </p> <p>The view from this outsider is that the referee Steve Bennett did the right thing. All parents recognise the signs of a little one getting past himself with excitement and running round, shirt over head, yelling your brains out is plainly one of them. Bath, bed and lights out after one Thomas the Tank Engine story (\"And, if you keep interrupting me by fidgeting and asking questions, I'll stop straight away\") was what young Cahill desperately needed. </p> <p>A few moments more and all that joy would surely have ended with him lying on the floor screaming and kicking because David James would not let him try on his gloves while David Moyes stared angrily at his assistant Alan Irvine and hissed: \"Did you give him a fizzy drink?\" </p> <p>My opinion, however, was not shared by many observers. Ludicrous and draconian was the majority view of the red card. \"The game's going mad,\" summed up Kevin Keegan who knows more than most about the subject. Since nobody questioned why a fully grown man should want to run around in public with his shirt over his head I must conclude that it is perfectly commonplace in Britain for working folk to celebrate the completion of a professional task in some such exuberant manner. </p> <p>What a splendid cavalcade of entertainment this must provide. I imagine that after you bought this newspaper and the newsagent handed you back the correct change he performed a series of pelvic-thrusting motions at the counter-top while pulling a face in which ecstasy and triumph intertwined, and that the traffic warden after correctly placing a ticket beneath the windscreen wiper of your car struts towards passers-by ostentatiously kissing the badge on her uniform, while down the street a refuse collector dances the lambada with the nearest lamp-post after safely manoeuvring a wheelie bin through a treacherous belt of potholes. </p> <p>Nobody would argue that these carefully considered explosions of spontaneous joy are not a delightful civic adornment but you have to wonder where it may end. </p> <p>On the opening day of the Spanish season, for example, Espanyol's midfielder Ivan de la Pena was sent off by the referee Antonio Rubinos Perez for \"arguing and touching his testicles\". This is not the first time this sort of thing has happened in Spain either. A decade ago Real Madrid lost Hugo Sanchez to suspension after the Mexican striker was found guilty of \"clutching his genitals in a provocative fashion\". </p> <p>Sanchez (a fully qualified dentist - sorry, but I feel compelled to blurt that out whenever I mention him) had no sooner got back into the team than his colleague Michel was hauled before a disciplinary committee after an incident during which the Real midfielder was accused - in the charming language of the Spanish FA - of \"slyly crushing [Carlos Valderrama's] most secret intimacy\". Michel attempted to explain the whole thing away as a zany joke but ended up being fined 50,000 pesetas. </p> <p>The worry from where I am sitting is that Tim Cahill's chest may be the thin end of the wedge.</p>",
  "<p>So Lancashire are relegated and Gloucestershire stay up. Confirmation came at 4.35pm yesterday when Andrew Crook hooked Jon Lewis to deep square-leg for Gloucestershire to capture Lancashire's sixth wicket and a second bowling bonus point, meaning they cannot be caught by the Red Rose county. </p> <p>This day had seemed inevitable for weeks but was still a sad and unacceptable one for such a big county, tipped by all and sundry to be champions this year and end a 70-year wait for an outright title. Their relegation leaves only Surrey and Kent who will not have played Second Division cricket since the championship was split in 2000. </p> <p>Change is certain, with the captain Warren Hegg sure to stand down; Stuart Law, who is English-qualified next season, and Mark Chilton appear favourites to take over. There are likely to be two new overseas players in Brad Hodge and Muttiah Muralitharan. </p> <p>Lancashire had begun the day, after 20 overs had been lost to rain, knowing only something special - like a score of, say, 400 for five - would save them and they were given some hope by an opening stand of 87 between Chilton and Iain Sutcliffe. But there was an uneasiness about that alliance which hinted at future difficulty. </p> <p>Sutcliffe was troubled by the left-arm seam of the Australian Nathan Bracken, who struck up a miserly partnership with Lewis. But it was spin that naturally provided the breakthrough. Just as Gary Keedy had been for Lancashire, so the left-arm spinner Ian Fisher was introduced early for Gloucestershire - in the 14th over - though he did not make the same initial impression as Keedy, who is reckoned by many to be the best spinner in the country. </p> <p>Fisher, with his lower-slung action, does not give the ball the same rip and relies more on persistence for his victims. Before yesterday he had only 18 championship scalps at 52.16 this season, but a first five-wicket haul of the season here was just reward for honest endeavour. Soon he lured Chilton into inelegantly scooping a low full toss to Philip Weston, diving forward at mid-on, and Sutcliffe followed without addition to the total, attempting once too often to loft over the top and the off-spinner Martyn Ball taking a sharp head-high return catch. </p> <p>Ball has also had a moderate summer, appearing in only his seventh championship match, but he too relished this opportunity on a dry pitch. He soon added Mal Loye, caught at silly point pushing defensively off pad then bat, and then Glen Chapple. In between Fisher had claimed the prized wicket of the Australian Law, a second catch for Weston at mid-on, from an ungainly heave. </p> <p>Carl Hooper, who could become a Kolpak player next season, provided the innings of the day while the stakes were still high, with a 93-ball 77, hitting Fisher for three consecutive fours to reach his fifty, but he succumbed, slicing to cover, before Hegg and Sajid Mahmood made up Fisher's seventh career five-for. All that was left was some lusty hitting from Dominic Cork that rather damaged Fisher's figures.</p>",
  "<p>Hal Sutton, the US Ryder Cup captain, reckoned that the wives and significant others could be worth as much as half a point to his players. He said: \"They have an opportunity to make a difference - and I want them not to be afraid to make a difference.\" </p> <p>The women were going to have to work overtime after his men's dire start. </p> <p>The distaff team had looked all business as they trooped down the clubhouse stairs on the way to the 1st tee, dressed in electric-blue tops and grey skirts or trousers and clutching the kneelers issued to those with access inside the ropes. At least Ashley Sutton, who worked with Teri Schleifer of the clothing company Fairway and Greene to design the one-off wardrobe, had not asked for a feminine version of the stetson her husband wore on the 1st tee. The brief was for something \"very classic, very beautiful and traditional, along the lines of Katharine Hepburn\", said Schleifer. </p> <p>It needed to be practical as well, given the demands of tramping the fairways in pursuit of your man. </p> <p>Blonde many of the wives may be but these are no bimbos, rather strong, independent women in the tradition of Barbara Nicklaus, who raised five children while Jack was winning majors. They are both knowledgeable and enthusiastic and very much a part of the team effort, though only Phil Mickelson spent more time away from the course beforehand. </p> <p>\"There was no shopping,\" said Caroline Harrington, as she watched her husband Padraig and Colin Montgomerie take on Tiger Woods and Mickelson. \"I've not been inside one shop but there's been a lot of hair, make-up, nails and fashion.Why can't this be two weeks long?\" </p> <p>The fun stopped yesterday. Caroline said: \"Padraig was up at 10 past five so it was one up, all up. The girls met in the team room at seven and left at 7.30. It was so busy I didn't have time to think.\" </p> <p>The Dubliner, bubbly and outgoing, is not one to watch a match \u00e0 la Lucy Henman, stoic, controlled and showing little emotion; she lets everyone know how she is feeling. When her husband rolled home a 30-footer for an unlikely birdie at the 8th, Caroline, sitting cross-legged with other black-clad European supporters, raised her arms as the ball tracked towards the hole, then clapped and cheered when it fell in. Then it was off, ever onwards, incorporating themselves into the swarm of the yellow-bibbed press pack. </p> <p>Life was a little quieter elsewhere with Monserrat Jim\u00e9nez, armed with shooting stick, softly urging a Darren Clarke putt holewards: \"Vamos, vamos.\" The ball, English-speaking presumably, ignored her and stayed above ground. </p> <p>Wives have privileges and being close to the action is perceived as one of them, though yesterday morning some of the Americans might have preferred to be far, far away. Most family members, however, have to keep an eye on their loved ones from a distance. </p> <p>Phil Mickelson Snr relies on one of the periscopes he sells in the merchandise tent to keep tabs on his son. \"I can see Phil change his ball with this,\" he said of his latest model. And check his good-loser hand- shaking technique as well, presumably. </p> <p>Some relatives are not here only for the golf. Sue Shapcott, sister of Alison McGinley, flew in from Dallas to ambush her sibling on the 4th hole. \"They keep them quarantined,\" Sue said of the wives, \"but I had to show her my teeth. I've just had them bleached.\" And she flashed an ultra-white smile which reflected the European mood.</p>",
  "<p>In the end Wigan did not have to rely on events at Odsal on a night of farewells, their hard-earned win guaranteeing them fourth spot and a home play-off tie against St Helens next Saturday. </p> <p>Adrian Lam, one of six Wigan players making their final league appearance, was the match-winner, landing a drop-goal seven minutes from time before laying on Kevin Brown's clinching try. </p> <p>Lam and Craig Smith will retire at the end of the season. Terry O'Connor and Mick Cassidy are Widnes-bound, provided that club retain top-flight status tomorrow, and David Hodgson and Luke Robinson will leave for Salford. </p> <p>Warrington threatened to spoil the party, with Mike Forshaw, captain for the night in his final game, leading by example against his hometown club. Their huge travelling army of fans lent a carnival atmosphere to proceedings and were rewarded when J\u00e9r\u00f4me Guisset, bound for rugby union in his native France with Brive, picked his way over from Jon Clarke's superb pass. </p> <p>Wigan tied the scores at 6-6 when their captain Andrew Farrell took matters into his own inspiring hands, powering his way through two tackles from Lam's short pass. </p> <p>Though Farrell sat out the second half, suffering from flu, Wigan appeared to take control as Martin Aspinwall burst over and Danny Tickle tagged on a penalty after Paul Wood was sin-binned. But Warrington regained the lead when the Kiwi winger Henry Fa'afili twice leapt high to collect towering kicks from Lee Briers and create tries for Brent Grose and Daryl Cardiss. </p> <p>Tickle restored parity with a close-range try, allowing Lam to lead Wigan home and preserve their unbeaten home record this year. </p> <p>No side have ever reached the grand final after finishing outside the top three and Wigan will have to improve markedly to break the trend and give their departing players a happy ending. </p> <p>\"We had to take charge of our own destiny and we did that,\" said Wigan's acting coach Denis Betts. \"It wasn't a huge motivational tool to keep our home record. A bigger one was thinking of the trophy with the ribbons on at the end of the season.\" </p> <p> <strong> Wigan Warriors:</strong> Radlinski; Aspinwall, Wild, Brown, Dallas; Orr, Lam; O'Connor, M Smith, C Smith, Farrell, Tickle, O'Loughlin. <strong> Subs:</strong> Hodgson, Cassidy, Robinson, Hock. </p> <p><strong> Warrington Wolves:</strong> Cardiss; Fa'afili, Grose, Westwood, Gaskell; Briers, N Wood; Lima, Clarke, Hilton, Sibbit, P Wood, Forshaw. <strong> Subs:</strong> Gleeson, Hulse, Guisset, Leikvoll. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> S Ganson (St Helens).</p>",
  "<p>Bernhard Langer has always been great with the driver, sharp with the irons, and once he made peace with the yips, pretty good with the putter, too. As the European Ryder Cup captain, he also has a nice touch as a director. </p> <p>It was Bernhard the Director who knew that sooner or later he would have to pair his Young Guns, Sergio Garc\u00eda and Luke Donald. It came sooner than anyone expected - in the afternoon foursomes of the first day when the Europeans had a substantial but hardly decisive toehold against the Americans. It was one thing to send out Donald in the morning four-balls in the company of the older, wiser and one-time veteran Paul McGinley. It was quite another to send him out again in the afternoon with another kid. </p> <p>It was Donald, 26, with one victory in his three years on the US PGA Tour and two on the European Tour, and Garcia, the crusty veteran, all of 24 - a kind of senior-junior partner - with nine pro victories and two Ryder Cups under his belt. </p> <p>Even Bernie the Director may not have wanted to play this one so close. Garcia and Donald went three up through the 10th and the 12th, then seemed on the verge of wilting away. Donald looked like a shaky rookie for a while, as in missing a short putt, but they pulled themselves together for a 2-up victory over Kenny Perry and Stewart Cink in a foursomes match that ended up being the final and dramatic moment on a dramatic day for Europe. </p> <p>With their win, Europe came out of the first day leading 6 1/2 - 1 1/2, and even the dream team of Tiger Woods and Phil Mick elson could not prevail against them. US captain Hal Sutton went for a quick knockout and got knocked out instead. They lost both of their matches. </p> <p>The decisive Donald-Garc\u00eda moment came at the par-3 17th. Donald, having blown a short putt back at the 14th, put his tee shot some 14 feet behind the pin. Garc\u00eda's birdie putt stopped dead short. Cink and Perry, who ended up in deep rough behind the green and got little out of the chip, conceded the putt, the hole and the match. </p> <p>The prospect of young gun pairing had been raised earlier with Garc\u00eda. \"Yeah, it would be great to play with someone like Luke, who is a friend of mine,\" Garcia said. The question also involved experience. \"I think experience is definitely important,\" Garc\u00eda said. \"You know, nowadays, everybody can play. On any given day, a good player can be anybody else all over the world.\" </p> <p>But then, there also was the question of good chemistry, as in winning combinations, such as Garc\u00eda and Lee Westwood in a 5&amp;3 frolic over David Toms and Jim Furyk in the morning four-balls. \"One of the explanations might be that we both see the putts the same way, so we're helping each other read them,\" Westwood said. \"But I think that we just play good together because we get on so well.\" Donald was steady in the morning with Paul McGinley against Chris Riley and Stewart Cink. That was the only match the Americans did not win, and it was Cink's birdie against Donald's par that at the 15th that tied it and Riley's 6-footer for a par at the 18th that squared. Garc\u00eda, playing with Westwood against Toms and Furyk, won to holes with birdies, lost two with a bogey and a par, and clinched the win with a par at the 15th. Neither Don ald nor Garcia missed a beat, paired together. </p> <p>Donald holed a three footer to win the 10th for the three up lead. Garc\u00eda's approach to the 11th rolled back down into the fairway, and they bogeyed. They went back to three up on Donald's medium putt at the 12th and then things got interesting. </p> <p>Perry holed a 25-footer at the 13th, and Donald missed a 4-foot par putt for a half at the 14th, leaving the green with a hollow look. They were only 1 up and leaking oil. Then Garcia holed a 4-footer after Perry's 5-footer lipped out at the 15th, and after Donald just missed an eight footer for the win at the 16th, he got the tee shot home at the 17th to set up the win. The Kiddie Korps was home free, and Langer was breathing easier, smiling and reaching for his lineup card.</p>",
  "<p>Cricket officials held an emergency meeting with police and stewards at The Oval yesterday to review security measures after crowd disorder injured several stewards at the end of the Champions Trophy tie between Australia and New Zealand. </p> <p>Cricket's dismay at the government's consistent refusal to legislate to make invading the field a criminal offence has deepened after the chaotic scenes on Thursday in which stewards repeatedly rugby-tackled a succession of supporters who were baiting them in a drunken competition to outrun security and reach the square. </p> <p>Police refused to intervene to quell the disturbances even when stewards were pelted with beer and trays on the boundary by hundreds of jeering spectators. Several broke fingers in running feuds which dragged on for nearly half an hour. </p> <p>More than a dozen supporters were ejected and cricket officials were privately aghast that police refused to make arrests because they lacked sufficient manpower. </p> <p>\"We were promised by the government that present legislation was sufficient to act against such incidents but the police said that they were too busy to make arrests,\" a spokesman for the England and Wales Cricket Board said yesterday. </p> <p>Public order legislation allows for fines up to \u00a31,000 to be imposed on spectators but the ECB fears that any supporter invading the pitch after the last ball has been bowled might legally argue that the match was over. </p> <p>If the police refuse to make arrests then that debate is academic. Officials at The Oval on Thursday looked on as stewards repeatedly felled spectators with heavy tackles and called on more than one occasion for first-aid assistance. That no one was seriously hurt was a matter of good fortune. </p> <p>Cricket has banned spectators from the field ever since the last Ashes tour in 2001 when Australia's Michael Bevan was struck on the Lord's balcony by a beer can thrown from the crowd. </p> <p>An ICC spokesman joined forces with the ECB yesterday in stating: \"We have seen other countries, notably Australia, introduce legislation to make pitch invasion an offence and, properly backed in the courts, it has proved an extremely efficient deterrent.\"</p>",
  "<p>On a windy, miserable and ultimately wet day, a world away from the steamy heat of Colombo, Sri Lanka made England struggle yesterday. Only a brace of dropped catches, neither of the most testing variety, which allowed lives to Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Flintoff, prevented the former World Cup winners from seizing control of what is, in effect, a play-off for a semi-final against Australia in Birmingham on Tuesday. </p> <p>Persistent rain throughout the afternoon prevented play beyond the 32 overs bowled, by which time England, not surprisingly put in to bat by Marvan Atapattu, had battled their way to 118 for three, 64 of them to Trescothick and 21 to Flintoff, the pair having added an unbroken 48 for the fourth wicket. </p> <p>The match resumes this morning as a full game, and England will know that, given the conditions, which are not likely to change radically, any score of more than 200 will be defendable. The Sri Lankan seamers found help and there was significant turn too for the legspin of Upal Chandana but such a total is well within England's compass and they remain favourites. </p> <p>In the event of a complete washout today (20 overs of the second innings must be bowled to constitute a match) England would go through on account of their superior run-rate against Zimbabwe. </p> <p>Sri Lanka, at times, are capable of astounding feats in the field but the lapses may yet take the game away from them. Trescothick had made only nine when he hoisted the seam of Farveez Maharoof high to mid-off where Nuwan Zoysa made a mess of the chance. </p> <p>Later Flintoff, having made only a single, pushed tentatively at an away swinger from Chaminda Vaas, edged, but then saw Mahela Jayawardene, a solitary slip, also make a hash of things. Thus far Trescothick has faced 95 balls, a low rate of scoring by his standards, and hit seven uncomplicated, robust boundaries. </p> <p>England, having lost yet another toss they would like to have won, found it heavy going. The early part of the night had been clear and cold, with consequent dew, and the cloud cover then sealed it in. The movement was not extravagant but niggly so timing was difficult. Vikram Solanki managed to hit four boundaries in 18 runs before he edged Maharoof to Kumar Sangakkara, helpfully wearing a Dilshan sweater, behind the stumps. </p> <p>Michael Vaughan, whose capacity to adapt to the different demands of one-day cricket is still unproven, continued what has been a poor summer in this form of cricket by succumbing to a bizarre dismissal. </p> <p>He had already managed one streaky boundary by inside-edging Zoysa past his stumps. Goodness knows what possessed him in the same bowler's next over, however. By the time Zoysa, left arm over the wicket, released the ball he already had a good sight not just of leg-stump but of middle as well. </p> <p>In the circumstances it is hard to define precisely what shot Vaughan attempted. Suffice to say whatever it was needs more practice: the ball passed behind his legs and careered into middle and leg. </p> <p>His five runs took his aggregate in 10 one-day innings for England this summer to 147 runs, 74 of them in a dead match against India. Were he not captain, there would be questions to ask concerning his place. </p> <p>With Trescothick battling away, England needed a scrapper at the other end and briefly, it looked like being Andrew Strauss. </p> <p>However, the left-hander has gone off the boil since his meteoric rise to international status and yesterday, having survived one skied pull - the ball floating away on the wind from the chasing fielder at square-leg - he was the architect of his own downfall. </p> <p>Maharoof's fielding at third man, as Strauss angled the ball in that direction, had no particular urgency and perhaps the batsman was seduced by that into attempting a second run. </p> <p>However the throw was pin-point over the stumps and Strauss was a foot short with his desperate dive as Sangakarra broke the wicket.</p>",
  "<p>You probably won't have seen TV pictures of a well-developed guy dressed as Catwoman, standing on the roof of the Lord's pavilion. That's because some other bastard dressed as Batman stole my thunder at Buck House, desecrating the place where the Queen Mum and Princess Diana once stood (or blokes disguised as them). It was a stupid protest anyway. If they had one called \"Dads 4 Seeing Less of Their Kids\", Dave Podmore'd do 'em a deed of covenant and loan them his precious fancy-dress party box, the contents of which have been lovingly gathered during more than three England tours.</p> <p>Pod was on top of Lord's, not as you might think protesting against the modernisation of the pavilion and the addition of a Carluccio's, a phone shop village and a stain-removal facility in what was the Library. All of these are proactive proposals that can only benefit the innercity member, although the downside is that during the renovations they'll have nowhere to go till March.</p> <p>It's especially hard on sad old geezers like Richard Stilgoe and Julian Lloyd Webber who, to be honest, struggle to get work outside the Winter Gala Nights in the Long Room. I believe arrangements have been made for them to have their lunch at the Soup Opera on Paddington station concourse, with a women-free zone specially cordoned off for them with red and yellow tape.</p> <p>But my super-heroine protest at HQ was a principled stand against one of the game's most grievous injustices, summed up in a catchy slogan printed in Letraset across my Wonderbra: \"Lads 4 Less Aggravation\". It's not widely known that a meddlesome law, sneaked in last year, has resulted in the sad spectacle we've been witnessing at Old Trafford, namely Gloucestershire trying to beat Lancashire rather than declaring after ball one to deny them the bonus points they need to stay up, which would get the whole thing sorted with a minimum of wear and tear on the athletes' physiques.</p> <p>This is a piece of cruel and divisive bureaucracy (I wrote that bit on a piece of cardboard which I then held up for several hours, luckily having my big charity cheque training to fall back on). But it sets county against county, lad against lad, and nothing can come of it except a lot of unnecessary batting, bowling and fielding in sub-zero temperatures. Look no further than the ICC Trophy, playing to one man minus his dog who's got more sense.</p> <p>I bet some of those Zim boys are wishing they were back home. Freedom is a small price to pay for warmth. Guys have already put their hammies on the line enough this summer. Now they need to be relaxing, spending time with their second and often third families or earning enough to support them by doing a few personal appearances.</p> <p>Sometimes you have to stick your neck out for what you believe in but Pod can assure you it's not easily done in a Catwoman outfit on the roof of Lord's. I was contravening the ladies' dress code (skirts, sandals and white ankle socks), plus I had to climb up into the turret through the fire escape, pushing aside a load of basques and a heart-shaped helium balloon left over from EW Swanton's 90th birthday thrash. After a while it was clear from the absence of photographers and TV catering wagons that there must be a bigger story going on elsewhere and I was wasting my time. I was starving too, to be honest.</p> <p>But at least Pod's escapade provided another much needed anecdote for his cricket roadshow. I've been struggling recently to compete with the Test Match Special team's effort which has been preceding Pod into the country's top venues, especially as theirs has on-stage cake and a highoctane MC in Ralph Dellor.</p> <p>Last week at Stevenage the first question out of the drum was: \"Pod, how do you have the barefaced cheek to charge \u00a319.50 for this?\" Next up: \"Did you know your flies are undone?\" followed by: \"When did you last see your flies - was it (a) 1987 (b) Never (c) King Zog of Albania?' Bloody smartarses. I put the tickets up to a pony after that.</p> <p>In fairness, though, I did invite the audience at the end to contribute to the hurricane appeal for the poor buggers in wherever it was. None of which can do any harm to my chances of an MBE nod.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Dave Podmore was putting on his tights and heading for the House of Commons with Christopher Douglas and Andrew Nickolds</p>",
  "Russia's most wanted man, the Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev, taunted the Kremlin yesterday by claiming responsibility for the attack on the school in Beslan and saying he had personally trained the hostage-takers. <p>Mr Basayev openly mocked President Vladimir Putin, who has put a $10m (\u00a35.5m) bounty on his head, for \"screaming like a stuck pig\" about the attack, which he said was an effort to take the Chechen war back to Russia. </p> <p>Mr Putin received a further blow to his prestige yesterday when two of his Kremlin predecessors and erstwhile supporters, Boris Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev, criticised him for endangering their hard-won democratic reforms. </p> <p>In a statement on a Chechen rebel mouthpiece website, Mr Basayev denied knowing Osama bin Laden and sought to blame the Beslan bloodbath on the Russian attempt to storm the school. </p> <p>He called for a UN investigation into the chaotic episode, and promised to cooperate. </p> <p>\"Putin screamed like a stuck pig and said that ... war was declared on Russia,\" he said. \"He wants the rest of the world's involvement with the blood spilled in Beslan and appeals for help, but he forgets that Chechnya is Russia's internal affair.\" </p> <p>News agencies reported that Mr Basayev also took credit for a bus-stop bombing, a metro bombing and the destruction by suicide bombers of two passenger aeroplanes last month. </p> <p>More than 400 people were killed in the four attacks. </p> <p>He said he had personally trained the 33 hostage-takers in the woods 12 miles from Beslan, and warned of more attacks, promising to continue the fight \"by our rules\". </p> <p>The national airline Aeroflot said yesterday that it would appoint security officers to oversee all operations after it was reported that the suicide bomber had bribed a rival airline employee to get on board one of the ill-fated flights on August 24. </p> <p>And the Moscow police defused a powerful bomb outside a busy metro station in an eastern suburb on Thursday evening. </p> <p>Mr Putin said that the country was \"engaged in serious preparations\" to act against militants. </p> <p>He fired another broadside at western critics alarmed by his move to use his own \"war on terror\" to grab more power for the Kremlin. </p> <p>\"A patronising and indulgent attitude to the murderers amounts to complicity in terror,\" he said. He compared those who called for talks with Chechen separatists to the pre-war appeasers of Hitler. </p> <p>\"Every concession leads to expanding their demands and multiplying our losses,\" he added. </p> <p>Russia has already complained to Britain about statements made in London by Akhmed Zakayev, the envoy of the Chechen separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov. Mr Zakayev won asylum last year. </p> <p>British embassy officials in Moscow said London had already frozen the British assets of Mr Basayev's group and other known Chechen terrorist organisations. </p> <p>Mr Putin's robust response to the terror threat meanwhile drew criticism from Mr Yeltsin and Mr Gorbachev, both of whom advised against plan-ned constitutional changes that will let him appoint the currently elected regional governors and remove constituency elections for half the deputies in parliament. </p> <p>\"How can you stamp out corruption without a normal parliament or free press?\" Mr Gorbachev said in the newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti. </p> <p>\"Without control on the part of society? But there is no movement in this direction. The reverse is happening.\" </p> <p>Mr Yeltsin, who has avoided commenting on Mr Putin's policies since stepping down almost five years ago, was more guarded. </p> <p>\"The stifling of freedom and the curtailing of democratic rights is a victory for the terrorists,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Only a democratic country can successfully resist terrorism and count on standing shoulder to shoulder with all of the world's civilised countries,\" he said. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Russian intelligence service claimed yesterday to have apprehended an Algerian recruited to the Chechen cause in a London mosque four years ago. Intelligence officers say Burakhlya Kamal Rabat, who was caught trying to cross into Azerbaijan, is an aide to Mr Basayev.</p>",
  "The US military stepped up efforts to check Iraq's destabilising insurgency yesterday by pounding the restive city of Falluja, killing dozens of people, with children reported to be among the injured. <p>Details of the raids emerged as Baghdad was once again hit by a suicide car bomber, who attacked a police checkpoint. At least eight people died. </p> <p>The bloodshed came at the end of a desperate week in which more than 250 people were killed in fighting across the country, and three more westerners were kidnapped. </p> <p>Violence was also reported in Basra yesterday where British troops clashed with fighters loyal to the rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, raiding an office and seizing weapons and explosives after an ambush. </p> <p>A military spokesman said there had been one British casualty. </p> <p>The Baghdad car bomb exploded beside a line of police four-wheel drives, incinerating seven of the vehicles and sending a plume of smoke into the morning sky. Five policemen were among the dead and at least 50 people were injured. </p> <p>Police had set up the cars to block the Martyrs Bridge that crosses the Tigris in the centre of Baghdad, as part of an early morning operation against militants in the Haifa Street area, where there have been several days of fighting. </p> <p>US troops said they fired at another car packed with explosives that was heading towards their checkpoint in Haifa Street. The car exploded, killing two men inside and injuring an Iraqi national guard soldier. </p> <p>Through the morning there was the sound of heavy gunfire as US troops moved through the area. </p> <p>By the end of the day Iraqi police said they had arrested 63 suspects, including Syrians, Egyptians and Sudanese. Caches of weapons, including rockets and grenades, were also seized, Iraqi officials said. </p> <p>Yesterday's suicide bomb signalled a change of tactics. Car bombs have usually been directed at fixed targets such as police stations and entrances to the US headquarters, the heavily fortified green zone. But the latest attacks have been against moving targets and temporary checkpoints. </p> <p>On Sunday a car bomber also in the Haifa Street area detonated his explosives next to a moving US Bradley armoured vehicle. A similar attack last week on a passing US convoy in Falluja claimed the lives of seven US marines. </p> <p>For the past two weeks the US military has led air strikes on targets in Falluja almost daily against sites it says are used by fighters loyal to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian blamed by the US for conducting many of the bombings and assassinations that have shaken postwar Iraq. </p> <p>New US raids last night de stroyed four houses and killed at least six. They followed attacks on Thursday on a compound that the military said was being used by around 90 \"foreign fighters\" aiming \"to plan attacks against the Iraqi people, Iraqi security forces and multinational forces\". The military estimated that 60 people had been killed and three buildings destroyed. </p> <p>As is frequently the case, Iraqi officials and those in Falluja disputed the US military's account of the raid. </p> <p>A spokesman for Iraq's health ministry said 44 people died and 27 were injured. The injured included 17 children and two women, he said. Television footage showed seriously injured women and children. </p> <p>American jets bombed another compound in the south of the city early yesterday. The US military lost control of Falluja weeks ago and no longer patrols there. But commanders and Iraqi leaders are anxious to quell the militants before elections due to be held in January. </p> <p>Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, has questioned whether the poll will be feasible given the security situation. Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, said Britain could send more troops to police the vote, because it was determined the elections should go ahead. </p> <p>Britons in Baghdad are being urged to leave the country or live in heavily guarded buildings. The British embassy in an email circular warned of \"the change in tactics away from roadside abductions to entering properties to snatch foreign nationals\". </p> <p>\"Those of you who do decide to stay should review your own security arrangements and ... consider moving to premises within guarded areas. You should seek professional advice on whether the ... arrangements that you have in place are sufficient,\" it said.</p>",
  "<p>First published in 1961, and recently rediscovered by both readers and critics, Richard Yates's Revolutionary Road is the portrait of a failing marriage. Dialogues between husband and wife are brilliantly used to bring concealed resentments to the surface. In their ordinary conversations, Frank and April Wheeler learn every way to wound or disgust each other.</p> <p>Yet we also get imaginary dialogues: exchanges that only take place in Frank's head. We see the unravelling of the marriage largely from his point of view (though we are not required to sympathise with him) and hear the conversations that he imagines, quoted as if direct speech. The device is an uncommon one in fiction. Rarely are whole non-existent exchanges laid out on the page like this: \"He would say - She would say - He would say - \".</p> <p>Significantly, the first thing in the novel that Frank thinks of saying to April is something that he does not say. He has just watched her take the leading role in a disastrous amateur dramatic show. She has mortified herself in front of all their suburban acquaintances. In the dressing room she sits red-eyed, and he thinks of what words will be best. \"What he planned to do was bend down and kiss her and say 'Listen: you were wonderful'.\" But perhaps this is not the right thing to say. \" 'Well,' he said instead. 'I guess it wasn't exactly a triumph or anything, was it?' \" He sticks a cigarette \"jauntily\" between his lips.</p> <p>The casual attempt at irony is coarse. The dishonest, kind clich\u00e9 that he does not speak would have been better. But then the novel's imaginary dialogue always avoids the errors of real talk. In his thoughts Frank dramatises a life more satisfactory than the one he has. Yates's actual dialogues painfully chart the feuding of a married couple. Imaginary dialogue makes us feel the difference between what is said and what might have been said.</p> <p>It is also cruelly comic. In imagined exchanges, Frank satisfies his fatuous masculine self-esteem. Specially selected by his company's boss to write a series of pep talks for staff (\"Speaking of Inventory Control\", \"Speaking of Sales Analysis\"), he finds his wife utterly indifferent to the news. On the way home on his commuter train he had imagined her responses. He would pretend to be contemptuous of those who would offer him advancement for such specious nonsense: \"A thing like this just proves what a bunch of idiots they are.\" She would retort that he should not undervalue himself. \"I think it proves you're the kind of person who can excel at anything when you want to, or when you have to.\" And so on.</p> <p>After one imagined exchange with his wife, Frank looks in the bathroom mirror and finds \"a new maturity and manliness in the kindly, resolute face that nodded back at him\". The clever thing is that these imaginary dialogues are not just fantasy. They are grounded in what Frank and April might once have been able to say to each other.</p> <p>He remembers what she said as they lay in bed together after making love for the first time: \"You're the most interesting person I've ever met.\" The speeches that he dreams up are absurd in their fulfilment of self-regard. Frank imagines his chat with the analyst who will cure his wife of her discontent. \"I think your own evaluation of the difficulty is essentially correct, Mr Wheeler...\" He hears himself explaining, in a no-nonsense way, to the secretary with whom he has been having an affair that it is over, but, in reality, something in her eyes stops the words being spoken.</p> <p>At the book's end, Frank's habit of constructing imaginary dialogue is turned to truly painful use. April has bled to death after attempting to induce a miscarriage. Frank returns home from the hospital to find the evidence of her self-destructive desperation and to imagine her speaking. \"Two heavy towels, soaked crimson, lay lumped in the tub, close to the drain. 'I thought that would be the simplest way to handle it,' he could hear her saying.\" As he starts cleaning up, her domestic chat rings in his head. \"Try a damp sponge and a little dry detergent, darling - it's there in the cabinet under the sink.\"</p> <p>Only afterwards does he find that \"April's voice no longer spoke to him\". \"He tried for hours to recapture it, whispering words for it to say,\" but uselessly. His punishment for imagining her talk all too easily is that finally he cannot imagine it at all.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Mullan is senior lecturer in English at University College London</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you would like to respond to any of John Mullan's columns email <a href=\"mailto:books@theguardian.com\">books@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Easy money gains in buy-to-let property look increasingly difficult. Interest rate rises are eating up more of the monthly rent, capital values of property in many areas have hit a ceiling or are falling and potential tenants have a greater than ever choice - witness the forest of rental agents' signs in some towns. </p> <p>This week the Nationwide warned of the \"first signs\" of a cooling off among would-be landlords - a modest enough statement compared with a calculation from a senior member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting committee that house prices could fall by as much as 30%. </p> <p>But if investors think they've missed the buy-to-let boat, they may not need to worry. According to the promoters of a property investment exhibition being held at London's ExCeL venue this weekend, buying commercial property - shops, factories and office blocks - could be the way to make a faster buck. </p> <p>Nick Clark, whose firm runs the Property Investor Show, says: \"Narrowing yields in the residential lettings markets have led shrewd buy-to-let investors to look at commercial property as the next investment hot spot.\" </p> <p>One Yorkshire agent recently sold half of a new development of workshop units to \"amateur\" landlords - the remaining units went to owner occupiers. </p> <p>But Clark's views are controversial. Others in the property business warn that investing in commercial property is strictly for experts with deep pockets and long investment horizons. And they add that current purchase prices are high. </p> <p>Clark bases his view on a new survey from broker Mortgages for Business which shows \"89% of investors who currently do not invest in commercial property have plans to widen their portfolio to include commercial properties.\" </p> <p>But Mortgages for Business managing director David Whittaker believes citing \"commercial property as the next investment hotspot\" is \"stretching the statement\". </p> <p>He says: \"The survey was among clients and potential clients who realise that the quick buck profits of residential buy-to-let have gone. The only way forward is to accept a more modest, if safer, return. Some have bought flats above shops. Now they want the shops as well.\" </p> <p>Whittaker arranges loans for both residential and commercial landlords with an average \u00a3120,000 borrowing on houses and flats and a typical \u00a3300,000 on a shop or small workshop/office unit. </p> <p>He hopes to see his commercial property loans business grow as banks and building societies start to offer \"off-the-shelf\" mortgages similar to buy-to-let packages. </p> <p>But John Heron at Paragon Mortgages, one of the first and biggest in the residential buy-to-let market, is not impressed by the \"hotspot\" claim. He says: \"We have looked at this area and decided there was very little cross-over between residential and commercial so we will not offer a commercial mortgage. Assessing the risk is just too difficult - it has to be on a costly case by case basis.\" </p> <p>Heron believes commercial property is a series of specialist areas which are not homogenised. </p> <p>\"Residential letting is driven by demographics. People need a roof over their head and will be prepared to pay. But commercial property is driven by economics both locally and nationally,\" he adds. </p> <p>The Property Investor Show team also commissioned a survey which showed \"76% of property experts felt that commercial property had been the best performing asset class over recent years.\" </p> <p>Simon Cooke, of Hotbed, which organises investment into commercial property and unquoted companies for investors with at least \u00a325,000, accepts the historical truth of that statement. </p> <p>But the former property fund manager at Deutsche Asset Management is sceptical. \"Yes, prices have gone up but so much that commercial property is expensive relative to four years ago. Returns are falling - we'll need positive economic growth to sustain recovery,\" he says. </p> <p>\"The maths are simple. Rental yields have dropped to below 6%. But financing costs have risen to 7% or more. So, even if you can afford a 20% or 25% deposit, your interest costs are equal to your rental income. You are totally reliant on rents and capital values rising. If they don't, or if you are unhappy and a tenant goes bust, you are a loser,\" he adds. </p> <p>Cooke believes it would be \"totally sinister if the private investor was lured into commercial property. This is not the next investment hotspot.\" </p> <p>Jonathan Paul, the property analyst at investment bank ABN Amro, says the small investor's options are \"incredibly limited\". </p> <p>\"Only major investing institutions can afford top developments such as out-of- town retail parks. </p> <p>\"Tenants want to upgrade to prime property. This is not the right time in the economic cycle for quick buck investing. You have to ask how you will grow the rent - without that, your capital values are likely to remain static.\" </p> <p><strong>What to expect in the commercial sector</strong></p> <p>Commercial property mortgages work on much the same basis as the buy-to-let ones. Lenders want to see a deposit of at least 20% to 25% and a rent that more than covers the monthly interest outlay -typically the rent should be at least 130% of the loan cost. </p> <p>But most commercial property loans go a step further. Lenders will want to know about the tenant and the type of business they run. </p> <p>Most residential landlords work on six-month contracts with tenants. However, commercial property users need the security of long periods - top retailers want a 25-year lease,accepting upward rent reviews every five years in return. </p> <p>At the smaller property end, leases often run for five to 10 years. Lenders may want to credit-check occupiers as rents stop if tenants go bust. </p> <p>Besides losing rent, the problem is then finding another tenant. Buildings are zoned - you cannot usually replace a car parts retailer with a fast food outlet. </p> <p>On the plus side, the rent you get from a commercial tenant is money in the bank. The tenant is generally responsible for repairs, business rates, most insurances and other running costs. </p> <p>Figures from Business Moneyfacts show commercial property mortgages range from 1% to 5% over the Bank of England base rate (now 4.75%) with most loans currently costing from 6.5% to 7.5%. </p> <p>Most of the big mortgage firms will lend. But landlords taking the plunge into commercial do need expert broker help - this is not a DIY loan market. </p>",
  "<p>Investment companies, the managers they employ, and the advisers who sell their products rarely look other than prosperous. But where are their customers' yachts, fast cars, luxury London flats, and all the other trappings of wealth? In most cases, these riches never happen - even worse any money they might have had has evaporated in Equitable Life, precipice bonds, split capital investment trusts or endowments.</p> <p>Now a new book - \"Investing for Dummies\" by Jobs &amp; Money reporter Tony Levene - shows that even if you are a fund management first timer or don't know a privet hedge from a hedge fund, you can do as well - and often better - than the professionals. The secret is knowing about yourself, what you want from your money, and keeping things really simple. </p> <p>Here's our top 10 Dummies-style tips.</p> <p><strong>Check out your reason for investing</strong> </p> <p>Decide whether you want your money to spend tomorrow or in 10 or 20 years' time. Investing is about having money to spend some time in the future. All those pretty bits of paper with lots of impressive figures on them will not buy a pack of sweets.</p> <p>So look for investments which fit your personal timescale. Property is really long term. Shares need five years and longer. Below that, go for bank and building society accounts Aim for liquidity - it's no use holding a buy-to-let property valued at \u00a3500,000 if no one is prepared to bid for it. </p> <p><strong>Don't be afraid to be risk averse</strong> </p> <p>Investing is not the playground where you might be taunted with \"chicken\" if you don't accept big dares. It's your money so you can do what you like with it. And if you don't want to gamble, then don't. Remember that many of those who urge you to take risks do not put their own heads above the parapet. Equitable Life bosses had final salary pensions. Precipice bond sellers picked up 3% of your cash, no matter what happened.</p> <p><strong>Stand back from the crowd and remember the \"greater fool\" rule</strong> </p> <p>The worst investment mistakes are where you follow the mob. You only usually hear about a \"sure thing\" once the price has risen and those holding the assets want to get out. So they have to look for the \"greater fool\" who is going to pay even more than they did. Once the investing world runs out of fools, the price collapses. Remember dotcoms? </p> <p><strong>Split your money between asset types</strong> </p> <p>Leaving aside hedge funds (strictly for the rich and very savvy) there are four main asset types - cash, bonds, property and shares. Over the past five years, each asset class has been in - and out - of the limelight. No one knows which will be the next asset to soar - or slump. So why not split your money among all four? </p> <p>Watch out for so-called advisers who suggest putting \"just 10 to 20% of your money into Far East funds\", \"just 10 to 20% in Eastern Europe\" and \"just 10 to 20% in ethical unit trusts.\" Those percentages add up and you'll soon find nearly all your money riding on equity markets - a bad idea as shares tend to go up and down on a worldwide basis.</p> <p><strong>Avoid the gambler's fallacies</strong></p> <p>If you toss a coin up in the air five times and it comes up heads each time, what will the result be on the sixth spin? Most people opt for tails - on the grounds it must come up. A few go for heads, thinking the coin is flawed. The real answer is it could be either - the past has no effect on the future. The same goes for investments. And if your investment halves, don't double your holding on the grounds that everything that goes down must go up one day. Life is not like that!</p> <p><strong>Trading too much boosts your broker - and reduces your returns</strong></p> <p>Calculate the costs of getting in and out of an investment.

Repeat in and out costs several times a year and your broker will be rich and you'll be even further behind. Don't get suckered in by offers of free or low cost internet trading - even 0.5% government stamp duty every two months means your investment will have to grow 3% a year to stand still. </p> <p><strong>Get a handle on the odds - don't back potential disasters unless they can soar</strong> </p> <p>Compare your investment's possibilities with a \"certainty\" product such as a fixed rate building society account or a UK government bond whose maturity coincides with when you want your money back. </p> <p>If the risk free offering pays 5%, and the risky product is likely to return 8%, your gain is 3%.

You pay them, they collect them. Fund managers argue that 1.5% is very little to pay for their skills. But it is another hurdle for your money to leap - and most fund managers are just not worth that much. Go for a low cost investment trust or, if you have enough, buy a selection of major company shares and hold on for your equity money. Over 10 years, all those small deductions add up to a fortune. </p> <p><strong>Take your time - investments you rush at can evaporate just as fast</strong> </p> <p>Ignore dangerous phrases designed to rush you into a purchase such as \"limited time offer\" and \"only \u00a31m available\".

  "<p><strong> Author: </strong> Truman Capote (1924-84) grew up in small-town Alabama, next door to Nelle Harper Lee (Capote was immortalised as the precocious Dil in her novel To Kill a Mockingbird (1960). After moving to New York with his mother, Capote was hired by the New Yorker magazine as an office boy (and was soon fired), but made a startling entrance into literary circles with Other Voices, Other Rooms (1948), published when he was 23. </p> <p>It took him a decade to finish his second novel, Breakfast at Tiffany's (1958), and a year later he took on the New Yorker assignment to cover a quadruple homicide in Kansas that became In Cold Blood. (It was only published in 1965, after the execution of the culprits.) After In Cold Blood's success, Capote became a socialite extraordinaire. However, he alienated many friends with excerpts from his putative book, Answered Prayers, and died in 1984 after a long period of drug abuse. </p> <p><strong> Story: </strong> Capote had originally been offered the assignment as a way of exploring the effect of a gruesome crime on a wholesome, otherwise unremarkable American community. In November 1959, the entire Clutter family were found slaughtered in their home, and two ex-prisoners, Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, were eventually found guilty of the murders. </p> <p>Capote mixed journalistic reportage with speculative recreation, expending as much literary artistry on recreating the killers' activities as the detail of the investigation and the brutality of the homicide. As he followed the trial and its aftermath, Capote developed a special bond with Smith - to the extent that one of the police agents suspected that they had become lovers while Smith was on death row. After the book's publication, Capote was vilified by Kenneth Tynan in the Observer, who accused him of not doing enough to prevent the execution. </p> <p><strong> The film-makers:</strong> Richard Brooks (1912-92) started out as a screenwriter ( Key Largo, (1948)), but made his name as a director with a string of populist social-issue films: Blackboard Jungle (1955), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), Elmer Gantry (1960). No star names would be allowed to impede his authenticity-first approach to In Cold Blood, so former child actor Robert Blake and unknown Scott Wilson were hired as the leads. Blake, ironically, is currently awaiting trial for the murder of his wife. </p> <p> <strong> How book and film compare: </strong> Brooks kept Capote's structure; switching between the Clutters at home and the killers on the road before following the police investigation to reveal the horrific details of the crime as a finale. He shot sequences in all the original locations, including the Clutter's own house. But Brooks introduced a magazine writer character, Jensen, as a counterpart to Capote. More controversially, he shows Smith as subject to a string of fanciful delusions, including a vision of his gun-waving father as he kills Herb Clutter. </p> <p> <strong> Inspirations and influences: </strong> The black-and-white police procedural thriller goes back a long way in US cinema - early examples include T-Men (1947) and The Armored Car Robbery (1950). In Cold Blood was released the same year as Bonnie and Clyde, and shared its fascination with amoral killers at loose in the US midwest, though the latter movie deliberately glamourised its protagonists in the spirit of 1960s counterculture. A more direct descendant is Terrence Malick's Badlands (1973), a more ambiguous study of unmotivated murder.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Mann is a devotee of the mano-a-mano drama where two men, one reasonably good, one hopelessly evil, face off against each other in a duel to the death. This was the animating principle in Manhunter, the underrated precursor to Silence Of The Lambs, where a retired FBI agent (William Petersen) has to learn how to think like a serial killer in order to track down his depraved prey. It was also the linchpin of the excellent, if somewhat bloated Heat, where Al Pacino plays a reasonably bright LA cop grappling with an even smarter criminal (Robert De Niro), the only film in which the two Italian-American icons shared the screen. And it was the central element in the well-intentioned but dull Ali, where Muhammad Ali (a flabby Will Smith) embodies the forces of good, while George Foreman is portrayed as a hapless lackey of the racist, right-wing ruling classes. </p> <p>Mann likes this storytelling device so much that he contrived a parallel structure in The Last Of The Mohicans, a superb film where Daniel Day-Lewis plays the cunning rustic pitted against the corrupt aristocrat, and Eric Schweig plays the noble savage Uncas battling the ignoble savage Mugua (Wes Studi), one of the most memorable villains of the past quarter-century. </p> <p>Proceeding on the theory that what ain't broke does not need fixing, Mann returns to his favourite theme in Collateral, one of the few motion pictures to portray cab drivers in an entirely sympathetic light. Jamie Foxx (who starred as Malcolm X in Ali) is a luckless hack who dreams of opening an upscale limo service. All that separates him from his dream is money. Lots and lots of money. One night, an affable, well-dressed yuppie (Tom Cruise) gets into his cab and proposes renting his services for the entire evening while he makes a number of business calls. Foxx does not know that Cruise is actually a hired killer in the employ of nefarious drug lords the assassin himself has never met. But he will soon find out. </p> <p>Things go wrong almost from the beginning. In the best of all possible worlds, Cruise would prefer to go about his business, polishing off his five targets without his driver being any the wiser, and then grab the next flight out of LAX. But his first victim refuses to cooperate, plunging out a motel window onto the cab itself, and now the hitman's cover is blown. At this juncture, Foxx, who is not being paid all that well for this moonlighting adventure, would very much like to bow out of the proceedings. Cruise has other plans. Utilising the persuasive psychological techniques for which hired killers are famous, he induces Foxx to continue on their increasingly macabre odyssey. The corpses pile up. The cops, spearheaded by a dozy Mark Ruffalo, pick up the scent. The drug lords get nervous. And the cabbie will spend the remainder of the evening trying to figure out some way to get out of this mess alive. </p> <p>Collateral is a very good but not great motion picture. The story does not have all the twists and turns of Mann's best films, and the ending will come as a surprise only to those who are easily surprised. Foxx, who has made a reputation in the United States by playing the ubercool African-American stud, delivers an amazingly effective performance as a hapless working stiff who is a mama's boy, a dreamer, a bit of a loser. Jada Pinkett Smith, as the love interest, is lovely without being especially interesting. Ruffalo, as noted, looks like he could do with some shut-eye. What makes Collateral distinctive is that it marks Tom Cruise's debut as a villain. Often cast as a bastard (Jerry McGuire, Top Gun), sometimes cast as a schmuck (Magnolia), occasionally cast as a jerk (The Color Of Money, Far And Away), Cruise has apparently reached the point in his career where he has decided to do something completely different. (True, he once played a cocky bartender in the woeful Cocktail, but that doesn't count.) Playing a cold-blooded psychopath certainly fills the bill. It immediately calls to mind Henry Fonda's unforgettable turn as the villain in Sergio Leone's classic Once Upon A Time In The West, where the actor that most young people sneered at as the cinematic equivalent of their Uncle Harold unexpectedly turned up as a ruthless killer. Indeed, it is one of the great tragedies of motion picture history that Fonda did not go on to make more movies where he played the villain, as he seemed quite good at it. Nothing is more unnerving than a lovable uncle who suddenly goes stark raving mad. </p> <p>Cruise is remarkably effective in Collateral, largely because the role enables him to put his bad habits in the cooler. The headbeam smile is rarely flashed: the teeth are given the night off. Cruise, always an underrated actor, is phenomenally convincing as a conscienceless murderer. And unlike historical dramas such as The Last Samurai and Far And Away, where he seems like a guy who climbed out of the wrong time machine in the wrong society and the wrong century, Cruise looks perfectly at home in brooding, foreboding, late-night LA. </p> <p>It is not clear whether Cruise took this part because it was something he desperately wanted to do or because he feared that his days as an action hero were coming to an end and it was time to try a few new wrinkles. But it was definitely the right decision. As Nicolas Cage and John Travolta - not to mention the legendary Laurence Olivier - have demonstrated time and again, accepting a role as the quintessence of evil can sometimes be a very rewarding experience. Personally, I can't wait to see Cruise play Macbeth. Or Heinrich Himmler. He's got the chops. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Collateral is out now</p>",
  "British film makers, for so long the poor relations of their Hollywood counterparts, yesterday welcomed a new tax regime that will give up to \u00a34m toward the budget of the next Bend it Like Beckham or Trainspotting. <p>The tax credit will repair some of the damage caused to the industry earlier this year when filming on big budget movies such as Tulip Fever, starring Jude Law, collapsed following the sudden closure of a tax loophole. </p> <p>Peter James, whose production of The Merchant of Venice, starring Al Pacino, was made under the old tax regime, said the new system would encourage the British film business to shed its cottage industry image. </p> <p>\"It puts Britain firmly into the global commercial film market, instead of leaving it a parochial industry, which is what we feared might come out,\" he added. \"We were afraid that the new measure would be aimed at just making small British films.\" </p> <p>Mr James added that the credit will lock out opportunistic film investors who poured money into projects for a quick tax return, with no expectation of the film ever reaching multiplexes. </p> <p>Those abuses led to the Inland Revenue shutting down a different tax loophole in February this year, throwing many big-budget productions into chaos. </p> <p>Tulip Fever was the most high-profile casualty; The Libertine, a Johnny Depp film, received a last-minute rescue from the Isle of Man film fund. </p> <p>The credit is accompanied by a measure giving further tax relief if the film is a box office hit, a move Mr James said would prove \"very attractive\" to investors. </p> <p>The new tax regime will be unveiled by the Treasury on Tuesday. After months of negotiation with the industry, it has rubber-stamped a new version of section 48, a tax code that is a financial lifeline for producers. </p> <p>From 2006, homegrown films costing up to \u00a320m can claim back 20% of their budgets through the new arrangement. It means a British film at the top end of the scale can add \u00a34m to its budget and provides some certainty for an industry that regularly struggles for funding. </p> <p>A Treasury source said the government was keen to build on a record year for British film production in 2003, when \u00a31.17bn was invested in 177 features. However, that figure includes Hollywood blockbusters like Troy, partly filmed in the UK, and few homegrown hits. Industry observers pointed out that for every Bend it Like Beckham there are many flops. </p> <p>The box office failure of British films is often blamed on poor quality, but producers argue that their features struggle to get into multiplexes because the distribution market is dominated by Hollywood studios. The government is also looking at incentives for distributors to show British movies in their cinemas. </p> <p>Estelle Morris, the films minister, told the Guardian earlier this year that the government was determined to overhaul a tax system which has cost the Treasury an estimated \u00a3850m in loss of income. </p> <p>\"I want to give producers more financial security. There is an element in them that sometimes thinks 'this is the way it is, you had better cough up'. It is a very unusual sector and the one thing I would ask of them is to understand that for most of them one-third of their films are being financed by the taxpayer and that carries huge accountability and responsibility.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> A Bird in the Bush: A Social History of Birdwatching</strong> <br>by Stephen Moss <br>375pp, Aurum Press, \u00a316.99 </p> <p><strong> Beguiled by Birds: Ian Wallace on British Birdwatching </strong> <br>by Ian Wallace <br>304pp, Helm, \u00a329.99</p> <p>One of the most oft-repeated statements by modern birdwatchers writing in the press is the fact that the RSPB has more than a million members. One senses that at least some of the repetition is defensive. Being hooked ourselves, we want to underscore that if one in 30 of the adult British population is into the subject, then surely not all of us who chase birds can be nerds. </p> <p>Now we have further evidence that birders are gaining in self-confidence - two important works of history that suggest that we have a past worthy of record, understanding and even celebration. Although they have uncannily appeared at exactly the same moment - for the last major attempt you have to go back 30 years, to the work of the great German ornithologist Erwin Streseman - these two books could not be more different in their approach. </p> <p>Stephen Moss is a BBC producer for Bill Oddie's wildlife programmes and the author of several popular works, mainly on garden birds. The keynote of his new, thoroughly researched and well-written A Bird in the Bush is accessibility. In simple, lucid prose Moss maps out how ornithology has evolved from a specialist interest for a tiny minority among the landed classes into a multimillion-pound leisure industry. He is especially good at analysing the impact of contingent technologies - such as innovations in transport, publishing and optical equipment - and the developments that put time and money in the hands of the many and set us free to look at birds. </p> <p>He also incorporates political commentaries from well outside the realms of ornithology, quoting writers as diverse as George Orwell, Asa Briggs, Roy Porter and Michael Bracewell. He demonstrates how the evolution of the hobby fits neatly into a much larger cultural context and his wide perspective gives the book relevance far beyond the specialist. For the layman wishing to understand the subject, this is undoubtedly the easier book. </p> <p>Moss takes the end of the 18th century as his starting point and identifies Gilbert White, author of The Natural History of Selborne, the artist Thomas Bewick, and George Montagu (whose name is reflected in of our rarest bird of prey, Montagu's harrier) as key figures. Less easy to understand is his choice of the poet John Clare. Moss suggests that this great versifier of British nature exemplified an entirely new ecological sensibility. This may well be true, but since Clare also lapsed into obscurity after brief fame and was only really rediscovered in the late 20th century, an age more attuned to his own values, it is hard to square any claimed ambassadorial role with this long cultural exile. </p> <p>Moss's championing of Clare fits into the author's larger moral scheme, which contrasts the present birdwatching milieu-modern, democratic, non-lethal and objective bird study - with the elitist, collection-driven slaughter and sentimentalism of the Victorians. Although the strength of Moss's book is its clarity, this binary code is an over-simplification: it understates the massive debt we owe to our forebears. </p> <p>The reviled skin-and-egg collector, for whom there is now, arguably, little or no purpose, was, nevertheless, a pioneer. Bird skins are still a cornerstone of our knowledge and understanding. Not to emphasise this point is a real injustice. After all, the difference between now and then is largely the phenomenal advance in optical technology. Without it I'd probably still have a gun loaded with dustshot sitting by my desk instead of a pair of Nikon binoculars. To be fair to the author, he does make a case for the collector, as in his vignette of the Reverend Francis Jourdain, one of the most important birdmen of the 20th century, but it sounds like an apologia rather than the tribute he deserves. </p> <p>If you want a more sympathetic understanding of ornithology's remoter past then Ian Wallace's one-man extravaganza, Beguiled by Birds, would be a stronger bet. Septuagenarian Wallace is one of the godfathers of modern birding, but has a deeper emotional attachment to the gun-toting figures of the early 20th century, like the irascible Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen, David Bannerman or the young Peter Scott. </p> <p>Wallace is a highly individual talent with both pen and paintbrush, and he has taken as his model for this work Oliver Rackham's Illustrated History of the Countryside . Drawing on a large personal archive of photographs, he has also added 200 colour images, most his own paintings, some of which are truly beautiful. He has also incorporated work from other major bird artists such as Archibald Thorburn and Roger Tory Peterson, and anything else relevant to his story, from bird Christmas cards to old dustjackets, journal covers and graphs. The result is a rich visual feast and mixed-media assault, a perfect complement to Wallace's high-octane text. Where Moss politely ushers the reader forward and meticulously explains the route, Wallace drags you by the elbow, assuming you are as familiar with the terrain as he is. At its best his writing is highly entertaining and full of intellectual vigour; now and then it lapses into difficult compression. </p> <p>Despite the sharp differences between the two there is some overlap. Both authors have incorporated large amounts of unpublished testimony, in Moss's case acquired through interview. Much of the real \"history\" of birdwatching, particularly developments in the past 40 years, has never been written down before, and these books play a crucial part in securing this oral tradition. They also share a number of judgments. Both, for instance, seemed to have plumped for the same triumvirate as the key movers and shakers of the 20th century: the publisher Harry Witherby and the two Renaissance figures of British environmentalism, James Fisher and Max Nicholson. </p> <p>Both books proselytise for their hobby and largely avoid the awkward questions. Why is it that people emotionally engaged with other species sometimes find it difficult to relate to their own? If they sidestep the issue of social inadequacy, Moss at least examines questions of gender and race and explores why birds cause excitement predominantly among white, middle-class males. </p> <p>Curiously, another shared concern aired towards the end of both books is for the future of the amateur birdwatcher. Though generations apart, Moss and Wallace write of their own apprenticeships as a golden age and are anxious for today's practitioner, who is increasingly coralled by habitat loss on to reserves that function as little more than wildlife theme parks, where eco-merchants ply them with ever more complicated technologies and superfluous accessories. In this commercially saturated but environmentally impoverished age, Moss and Wallace wonder aloud about the source of the next raw recruits. But perhaps we needn't worry. You may not know this, but there are more than a million members of the RSPB. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Mark Cocker's Birders is published by Vintage.</p>",
  "<p><strong> My Life, by Bill Clinton (6hrs 30mins, Random House, \u00a314.99)</strong> </p> <p> Considering his legendary charisma, this autobiography, read by the former president himself with that unmistakable southern drawl reminiscent of Atticus Finch, should have made it the perfect bedside companion. Alas, it wasn't. The main reason that it flops rather than fizzes - as no doubt Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky and a great many other women will agree - is that 99% of Bill Clinton's charisma comes from his body language, which works wonders on walkabouts and TV but not on audio. </p> <p>So much for the medium; the message is equally flat. The book sounds more like a senate report than a memoir, bogged down with so many statistics, facts and dates that you feel you're being lectured. If only his prose were as relaxed as his manner, we might have been spared such pompous observations as \"it seems ironic now when rural Americans vote overwhelmingly Republican in national elections that I began my political career with a profoundly rural base born of intense personal contact and responsiveness, both to their resentments and real problems\". </p> <p>With one notable exception, it's the bits about his personal life - his raids on the cookie jar in his grandfather's grocery store, his first meeting with Hillary at Yale, family holidays in Martha's Vineyard - that are most interesting, a fact that the abridger has clearly realised. I'm reliably informed that a lot of the truly dull political stuff has been left out. The exception is his affair with Monica Lewinsky. If you were hoping for exciting new revelations about cigars and blue dresses, forget it. </p> <p> <strong> Living History, by Hillary Rodham Clinton (7hrs, Hodder Headline CD, \u00a319.98)</strong> </p> <p>Mrs Clinton may not have her husband's charm but she's definitely a better writer. It's all here - the personal detail about her mother-in-law, who \"no matter what else was going on in her life got up early, glued on her false eyelashes put on her bright red lipstick and sashayed out of the door\"; anecdotes about drinking moose-lip soup with Boris Yeltsin and having a run-in with Mrs Arafat. If you can take the loyal wife stuff (\"I hadn't decided whether to fight for my husband and my marriage but I was resolved to fight for my president\"), it's a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse of life inside the White House.</p>",
  "<p>\"I had to find a religion,\" said Graham Greene, \"to measure my evil against.\" This puts Greene the \"Catholic novelist\" (a description he detested) into correct perspective: before he chose Christ as his highest value, he was first a man obsessed with scale itself. No 20th-century writer had a subtler mind for human comparison. Where lesser novelists deploy broad strokes to separate good guy from bad, Greene was the master of the multiple distinction: the thin lines that separate evil from cruelty from unkindness from malevolent stupidity. His people exist within a meticulously calibrated moral system. They fail by degrees. And so there is no real way to be good in Greene, there are simply a million ways to be more or less bad. </p> <p>This detailed ethical realism is an aspect of Greene often neglected in favour of the more baroque aspects of his oeuvre - the forthright sexuality, the wanderlust, the journalistic reportage - traits which seem to place him securely amongst the company of his fellow adventurers: Erskine Childers, Len Deighton, Alec Waugh, John Le Carr\u00e9. Certainly Greene was always a writer interested in thrill - as a teenager he played Russian roulette of the deadly, non-metaphorical kind. Still, it's sometimes good to remind oneself of the fact that upon Greene's own book shelves Henry James reigned. Whatever else he was, Greene was a literary double agent, and some of the depth of his work is revealed when we reinscribe Henry James (rather than, say, his childhood hero H Rider Haggard) as his central antecedent. In Greene's novels, as with James's, all the vicissitudes of human personality are brought to the table for dissection. </p> <p>Distinctions of character that we fondly imagine concrete, upon which we define ourselves (\"But I am kind, where he is only cynical\"), are revealed to hold little currency in the face of the human extremities: war, death, loss and love. \"Human nature is not black and white but black and grey.\" Greene is not the first novelist to note it, but his grey was marvellously various. </p> <p>Into this grey area we must place the shady triad of The Quiet American: the honest venality of Phuong, the disengagement of Fowler, and the innocence of Pyle. Isn't it a brilliantly constructed novel? It reminds one of the game jack straws, in which the aim is to take each stick in turn without disturbing the others. It is a masterful trick to balance these three people against each other - comparing and contrasting their cynicisms, their hopes, their personal failures - and yet weighting the situation in such a way as to never allow us to make that final, satisfying judgement upon their characters which would signal that the reader's work is done. Greene did not like to permit his readers this satisfaction: \"When we are not sure, we are alive.\" </p> <p>In the case of The Quiet American ethical ambivalence is built into the very foundation of the novel. I spoke earlier of a calibrated moral system, and this reminds us of the careful, judicious James of The Europeans, but what a different job it is to place your people in a battlefield instead of a drawing room! You cannot be sure about anything on a battlefield. Greene was compulsively drawn to some of the messiest conflicts his century had seen, wars that people continued to fight long after the reasons to fight them had grown obscure. </p> <p>His characters radiate the ethical uncertainty and confusion that comes from living a war-without-end. But despite this, in Vietnam Phuong and the foreign correspondent Fowler have found each other, a blessing which seems, to Fowler at least, as much as can be hoped for. Theirs is a small ledge between a rock and a hard place. \"I'm a great believer in purgatory,\" said Greene in an interview, \"Purgatory, to me, makes sense ... one would have a sense of movement. I can't believe in a heaven which is just passive bliss.\" </p> <p>Into Fowler's purgatory comes Pyle, who believes in Heaven. He arrives armed with his grand narrative about Vietnam, which he will force Vietnam to fit, by hook or by crook. But he is not alone in clinging to misleading, self-serving stories in this novel. Pyle has his story about Fowler, but Fowler also has his own about Pyle (the dominant narrative of the book), a story that mistakenly casts him as more of a quiet American than he turns out to be. Both men have their equally distorting, unavoidably colonial, story about Phuong. </p> <p>None of these tales is to be trusted; they are shot through with personal need. Greene understood the selfish currents that run through our deepest motivations (he had been extensively psychoanalysed by a Jungian when he was still a young teenager) and he was unique in tracing the progress of these desires from their intimate microcosm (two people in love) to their geopolitical macrocosmic consequences. He knew one country could fall for another, get involved with it, grow tired of it and break its heart. In The Quiet American personal motivations are linked with their political mirror twins. Listen to Fowler's running commentary on his ex-wife's letter. Wherever there is a person mentioned, think of a country: </p> <p>Who could blame her for seeking my own scars in return? When we are unhappy we hurt.The hurt is in the act of possession: we are too small in mind and body to possess another person without pride or to be possessed without humiliation. Unfortunately the innocent are always involved in any conflict. Always, everywhere, there is some voice crying from a tower. I thought, \"How much you pride yourself on being d\u00e9gag\u00e9, the reporter, not the leader-writer, and what a mess you make behind the scenes. The other kind of war is more innocent than this. One does less damage with a mortar.\" </p> <p>Greene's personal-political layers work not by flattening the complexity of the relationships but by artfully recognising the connections and drawing them out. Love of a foreign country and love of its women are honestly expressed as related phenomena (when Greene was asked why he came to Vietnam he answered \"It was partly the beauty of the women - it was extraordinary.\") The simultaneous desire we all possess for both the liberty of our lovers, and their submission to our will, applies equally to Pyle's contradictory relationship with Phuong and the country she was born in. These mirrored applications are where Greene showed himself not only more than a hack but also more skilled than many English novelists. </p> <p>In this emblematic love triangle Phuong is of course representing Vietnam to some extent, but she is still everywhere her idiosyncratic self. She is the girl in white dancing better than Pyle, she is curled up in bed reading about Princess Anne. She keeps her counsel. One feels that where Greene did not know enough of her life, or could not imagine, he resolved not to describe. As a result Phuong floats free of her symbolic weights; she has her own inviolate life in the rue Catinat - buying silk scarves, drinking milkshakes - outside the reach of Fowler's narrative eye, and thus denying the reader's base and natural request that she embody her entire country. </p> <p>We sense a real, breathing woman, not just the idea of a woman that Pyle is trying to steal from Fowler. Part of Fowler's battle is to defend her essential Phuong-ness from Pyle's ossifying rhetoric. He is only partially successful at this. There are moments in which Fowler is self-conscious enough to glimpse the fact that his protection of Phuong against Pyle's idea of her leads him into new caricatures of his own. In fact, his first-person commentary is often more alert to the dangers of colonial caricature than Greene's own when the novel seems to fall into a more generalised third person: '\"For voices have a colour too, yellow voices sing and black voices gargle, while ours just speak.\" </p> <p>It is to be noted that ideological blind spots like these are first creative failures. It would have taken a further, fulfilling, imaginative leap on Greene's part to conceive of what Fowler sounds like to Phuong. Such lapses are unusual, however. Despite Fowler, this is a fiercely politically engaged work. The dissection of political naivet\u00e9 in the person of Pyle seems to gain in resonance with each year that has passed since publication: </p> <p>I hope to God you know what you are doing here. Oh I know your motives are good, they always are ... I wish sometimes you had a few bad motives, you might understand a little more about human beings. And that applies to your country too, Pyle. </p> <p>But the quiet American does not learn. To the end he remains determined that belief is more important than peace, ideas more vital than people. His worldly innocence is a kind of fundamentalism: he believes that there must be belief. By hook. By crook. </p> <p>Reading the novel again reinforced my fear of all the Pyles around the world. They do not mean to hurt us, but they do. Greene's great achievement is to allow a cynic like Fowler to champion the cause of life by insisting on the authenticity of those deaths Pyle considers to be merely symbolic. Fowler is at least idealistic enough to believe that there is not an idea on this earth worth killing for. When Pyle interrogates Fowler as to what, if anything he believes, he says \"Oh, I'm not a Berkeleian. I believe my back's against this wall. I believe there's a Sten gun over there.\" Pyle replies, \"I didn't mean that.\" </p> <p>Greene's work does mean exactly that. The hope he offers us is of the kind that only close observers can give. He defends us with details, and the details fight the good fight against big, featureless, impersonal ideas like Pyle's. Too much time has been spent defending Greene against the taint of journalism; we should think of him instead as the greatest journalist there ever was. If more journalists could report as well as Greene bringing us the explosion in the square, how long could we retain the stomach to fight the wars we do? </p> <p>The devil is in the details for Greene, but redemption is also there. The accretion of perfectly rendered, everyday detail makes us feel human, beats away the statisticians, tolls us back to ourselves. How many journalists can write reportage - or anything else - like this? </p> <p>... he smiled brightly, neatly, efficiently, a military abbreviation of a smile ... the gunfire travelling like a clock-hand around the horizon. \"Will you have a cup of tea?\" \"Thank you, I have had three cups already.\" It sounded like a question and answer in a phrase book. I have read so often of people's thoughts in the moment of fear: of God, or family, or a woman. I admire their control. I thought of nothing, not even of the trap-door above me: I ceased, for those seconds, to exist: I was fear taken neat. At the top of the ladder I banged my head because fear couldn't count steps, hear, or see. Then my head came over the earth floor and nobody shot at me and fear seeped away. </p> <p>When Greene died in 1991, Kingsley Amis - a man not given to generous estimations of his peers - gave him a neat, fitting obituary: \"He will be missed all over the world. Until today, he was our greatest living novelist.\" Amis's and Greene's vision of a great novelist was different from the present conception: it was of a working man with a pen. An unpretentious man, in and of the world, who wrote for readers and not critics, and produced as many words per day as a journalist. English writers these days work in spasms, both in quantity and quality, and so keen are they to separate \"entertainments\" from \"literature\" that they end up writing neither. This was one of the few distinctions Greene did not concern himself with. Reportage turned to novel turned to film; he got several short stories from the material he found in his own dream diary. He even occasionally dreamt to order: finding himself stuck in the middle of a novel one day, he went to bed and slept on the problem, waking up in the morning fully furnished with the solution. \"The book was hesitating ... the dream came and seemed to fit.\" </p> <p>Any writer would envy an imagination of such irresistible contrapuntal thrust - he never lacked a story, he was drowning in them. He famously said that childhood is the credit balance of the novelist, and Greene's childhood - the misery of his public school, the power struggles with his headmaster father, the teenage seduction of his own psychiatrist's wife, the flirtations with madness and God - well, he was never, ever going to be in the red. There are many natural storytellers in English literature, but what was rare about Greene was the control he wielded over his abundant material. Certainly one can imagine nobody who could better weave the complicated threads of war-torn Indochina into a novel as linear, as thematically compact and as enjoyable as The Quiet American. </p> <p>\u00a9 Zadie Smith, 2004 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This essay by Zadie Smith is her introduction to a new centenary edition of The Quiet American by Graham Greene which will be published by Vintage on October 7.

  "<p><strong> Clear</strong> <br>by Nicola Barker <br>pp346, 4th Estate, \u00a314.99 </p> <p>It can't have escaped anyone's notice that last September a black-clad, 30-year-old American multimillionaire incarcerated himself in a transparent plastic box and refused to come out of the papers for 44 days. </p> <p>As a gratuitous act of self-publicity, David Blaine's starvation stunt was unparalleled. Whether you considered him a showman of genius or simply an unshaven bloke slumped in a blanket - and there have always been plenty of those lining the Embankment in London - he was impossible to ignore. The Sky cameras were on hand 24 hours a day, his Hollywood pal Harmony Korine was there to film a documentary, and the semi-medieval sport of Blaine-baiting became a national obsession. </p> <p>It was the kind of pop cultural phenomenon about which books would surely be written: and perhaps it is no surprise that Nicola Barker should be the first to enshrine the event in fiction. Barker is instinctively drawn to the marginal, the outcast and the frankly unhinged; and is responsible for a pantheon of characters so bizarre that if one of them chose to sit and starve in a transparent cubicle it would probably qualify as normal behaviour. </p> <p>And, in a curious sense, Barker has already written about the Blaine phenomenon before. Her previous novel, the enormous metaphysical treasure hunt Behindlings, centred around the elusive presence of a confidence trickster named Wesley, a man who steals ponds, feeds his fingers to an owl and spends a night tucked up in the carcass of a horse. For some strange reason, people are inextricably attracted to Wesley. He has a devoted band of enthusiasts and disciples who log his every move. \"The funny thing about it,\" explains one of them, \"is that people are drawn to him. They like what he stands for - although he constantly bangs on about not standing for anything. And he has this strange way about him - a kind of simple charm - an innocence. Add to that all the pranks, the trickery, the mischief making...\" </p> <p>You have, in other words, the perfect encapsulation of the Blaine enigma; the difference being that while Wesley is Barker's own invention, Blaine has spent the best part of his career reinventing himself. Unfortunately, the magician's callow manipulation of his image is by no means as rich or satisfying as the oddball cast of weirdos and eccentrics Barker makes up for herself. </p> <p>She might just get away with it, were her narrator not quite so consistently irritating. Barker chooses to write in the laconically tiresome voice of a painfully hip young man, Adair Graham MacKenny, who talks like this: \"I don't make the rules, okay? I'm just a dispassionate observer of the Human Animal. If you feel the urge to argue this point (you're at perfect liberty to do so), then why not write a letter to Ms Germaine Greer? (That's it, love, you run off and fetch your nice, green biro... Yeah. And I'm sure she'd just love to read it, once she's finally finished rimming that gorgeous teenager...)\" </p> <p>That's on page two, and it never lets up. Boldly declaring that \"hyperbole is my middle name\", MacKenny's commentary is peppered with self-reverential wisecracks and catty asides: \"Well get me, coming over all empathetic, eh?\" he witters. \"Let's try to get to grips with all those deeply perplexing anthropological and behavioural niceties, yeah? Yeah?\" </p> <p>Thankfully it isn't all quite as sloppy as this. Barker still knows how to manufacture an arresting image; and niftily encapsulates the carnivalesque squalor of the Tower Bridge site as becoming \"like a toilet with Blaine the scented rim block dangling in his disposable plastic container from the bowl at the top\". She also posits the intriguing theory that the box is actually made of glucose: \"When he thinks nobody's looking, can't you see the bastard licking?\" </p> <p>MacKenny's main reason for hanging around watching Blaine hang around is that it's a good opportunity to pick up kooky girls. The closest the novel approaches to a plot is his pursuit of the wilfully opaque Aphra, a Blaine-groupie with a highly developed sense of smell, who works in the returns section of a department store, sniffing shoes to check whether they have been worn. Yet nothing Barker engineers can quite match the oddity of events which actually took place during Blaine's tenure beside the bridge: the Oxford student who befriended the magician by holding up quotations for him to read; Paul McCartney sacking his publicist when a photographer caught him box-watching at 1am; the 11 police officers disciplined for Blaine-gazing when they should have been on the beat. </p> <p>Barker is such a brilliant and original writer that it's hard to fathom why she felt the need to fire off what really amounts to no more than a fairly insipid commentary on a dull self-publicist. With a publication day set exactly a year and a day since Blaine entered his box, the text feels less spontaneous than rushed. Barker's fans will undoubtedly enjoy her rococo contortions of language and wilful flights of fancy. But for all that, Clear often feels like the kind of book you would expect Julie Burchill rather than Nicola Barker to produce.</p>",
  "<p>On one of the beautiful afternoons early this month I went to see the Diana fountain. Many had had the same idea, and Katherine Gustafson's stone halo was functioning as promised. That is to say, the water was swirling around, gushing in, gushing out; children were playing, adults were soaking their feet in it; one man was reading a book, sprawled across the stone channel. The desired balance of pleasure and respect, as far as I could judge, had been achieved. It had become a picnic place, a destination. </p> <p>When I mentioned to the Catalan sculptor Jaume Plensa (who has himself just designed a striking fountain in Chicago) that the estimated costs of maintaining the Diana fountain were going to be very high, he quickly replied that that would not be because the scheme was badly designed. It would be because it is a fountain. Look at the fountains in Rome, he said; there's always someone cleaning them out, working on their maintenance. </p> <p>And it is true that fountains need constant attention. True also that they are, by their nature, enormously expensive. The old fountains were gravity-fed - there was no alternative pumping system. One needed a water supply at sufficient height to power the jet. This might be a relatively simple matter to achieve in a hilly landscape such as Tivoli or Chatsworth. At Versailles it was a problem on a different scale. Miles of aqueduct had to be laid, at vast human cost, across inhospitable terrain. </p> <p>And I believe I am right in saying that the resulting hydraulic system was never powerful enough to work all the main fountains at once. Levers were pulled, pipes were blocked and unblocked in order to divert the flow. The visitor proceeded around the garden along the route determined by the king, stopping to admire each prospect as it came in view. At the same time a team of technicians was at work turning each fountain on in succession, and turning the others off. </p> <p>One admired the outlay, the sheer expense. The same is true at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland today. The gardens themselves are not beautifully designed, rather the opposite. But the hydraulics are immensely impressive, and it is instructive to time one's visit to coincide with the turning on of the whole system. Then one gets an impression of the volume of water involved and the power needed to shift it, before the rills, the channels and the cascades are working at full strength. </p> <p>It does not surprise me at all to learn that the Duchess of Northumberland is proud to show visitors the elaborate pump rooms and control systems required. Every modern fountain of any great force and scale must have a large amount going on behind the scenes - a capacious reservoir, pump-house, etcetera. Plensa's Chicago fountain has an extremely shallow pool, across which one can walk - achieving the illusion of walking on water. But in order to maintain the purity of this shallow effect, there is a deep reservoir below, and a powerful filter and pumping system. </p> <p>On two facing walls, on this Chicago fountain, a series of filmed images are projected, portraits of contemporary Chicagoans. At given intervals, the mouths of these portraits make an O, and from that precise spot a jet of water spouts from the wall, making the portraits into living gargoyles. </p> <p>The system is technically complex, but has been running without a hitch. The surface over which the public can walk is granite (as in the Diana fountain) but it is a rough-surfaced Zimbabwean granite on which people do not seem to slip. The teething problems were all legal. The Chicagoans who were filmed (1,000 of them) all signed release forms, allowing their faces to be used on the fountain. They were all volunteers, and were only involved because they liked the idea of the project. But the lawyers began to get cold feet about the rights of the owners of these faces, and almost postponed the opening. </p> <p>One would have thought that Gustafson could have foreseen the problems that might arise when people slipped on her smooth wet granite surfaces. Even since the parallel incisions have been made in the stone, it looks potentially dangerous to me. Rather more surprisingly, it does not seem to sit very pleasingly in the immediate landscape. It does not have the precision of effect that I was expecting, and it may well be that they need to readjust the ground level, once the soil has settled fully. (The turf itself didn't stand a chance against the visitor numbers.) </p> <p>Already of course they have readjusted the symbolism, asking people to pay more respect. And the visitors themselves have shown that what they want at the Diana fountain is to wash their feet. So Diana is washing everybody's feet, as Christ washed the feet of his disciples, and as countless popes have done since, washing the feet of the poor. The turbulence of the water, I might add, brings with it a memory of the Pool of Siloam. Surely the first miracles are not far off.</p>",
  "<p>A few days after her mother died, my wife brought home 12 bin bags and some cardboard boxes full of things. I helped her carry them up from the car and the remnants of Margaret's life - books, papers, clothes - have been sitting in a corner of our hall ever since. That afternoon, I withdrew to our garden shed, a favourite refuge of mine, to think. </p> <p>A day later, I found myself at Tate Modern in London, in a room full of fragments of charred wood and twisted metal: Cornelia Parker's Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View . Both installation and sculpture, Cold Dark Matter is the remains of a garden shed (and its contents) which has been blown to pieces. Thousands of fragments are suspended from the ceiling by invisible threads, frozen in space, a constellation of objects including burnt books, garden tools, a bicycle wheel and an ice skate. A single light bulb at their centre casts strange shadows on the walls. The visual impact of Cold Dark Matter is immediate but its meaning unfolds more gradually. </p> <p>Entering the darkened gallery space you see the shadows and the shape of the sculpture first, a perfect cube about 10ft wide, hovering just above the floor. You are then pulled closer by the objects, slowly recognising them: a hairbrush, a hubcap, a child's tricycle, all of them burnt, damaged, useless. You are looking at the aftermath of an explosion. The artist gathered the objects from various sources, placed them in a garden shed and then, with the help of the British Army, blew the whole lot up. </p> <p>Parker likes doing violent things to her materials: she has shot, crushed and stretched objects before. Yet what is surprising about this piece is not its energy or movement but its peace and tranquillity. The white heat of the explosion exists now as a memory, like the original big bang alluded to in the title. The splintered debris from one second in time is frozen in space in a perfect cube. The heat and violence are history, seen now as a warped and tarnished silver plate, the singed pages of a picture book or a charred splinter of wood. Each immobile fragment once had its own story, once belonged to someone's life. The fragility of Cold Dark Matter, the delicate shards of blackened wood suspended in space, the emptiness at its centre, confronts us with our own mortality. </p> <p>How long do you need to keep a dead person's belongings? What do you keep and what do you throw away? These questions seem central to Parker's work, yet I can imagine my irreverent mother-in-law laughing at this over-interpretation of a shed full of junk. Surely part of the point of this piece is to blow apart intellectual posturing about art. There is a jokey, junk-shop aesthetic to this work (a humour which runs through most of Parker's art) that links it back to Marcel Duchamp. (His Fountain, a ready-made urinal in fact sits in an adjacent gallery, a testimony to the cataclysmic changes in art of the 20th century.) </p> <p>After Duchamp, artists only needed to think of something, to go to a shop and buy it. Andr\u00e9 Breton, the founder of Surrealism, scoured the flea markets of Paris for bits of junk, while Parker sought out the objects for Cold Dark Matter from car boot sales. Parker is just one of many contemporary artists who have ceased to \"make\" new things. She is part of the generation of young British artists, \"yBas\", who were celebrated for the shot of radical energy they brought to British art in the early 1990s. </p> <p>Yet behind the facade of newness, assumed to be inherent to their youth, there is not only a reluctance to look forward but also an urge to destroy. In part, it is an adherence to Dada and Surrealist ideology, a continuation of the ready-made tradition of Duchamp, in part a response to the relentless consumerism of the west. The artist has lost faith in production. She no longer creates; she collects, co-ordinates, configures. </p> <p>British artist Michael Landy followed Parker's destructive impulse to its logical conclusion. For Break Down he created an inventory of everything he owned, a list of over 7,000 objects, and then ground every one of them to dust. This extraordinary event took place in a disused department store in Oxford Street among thousands of shoppers, stressing the ever closer relation of art and commerce. </p> <p>There is a paradox confronting every artist: the need to preserve the past as well as destroy it; the need to give, as Parker does, new life to old materials. Hanging high within Cold Dark Matter is a book which suggests she has thought long and hard on these issues - its title is just visible: The Artist's Dilemma. </p> <p>Also among the carefully chosen objects in Parker's shed are a number related to childhood: toys, a picture book, a tricycle. Nostalgia is inherent to Parker's work; the objects you look at have a history, were once something else. In another work, Breathless , Parker collected the instruments of a brass band, crushed them completely flat and suspended them like the objects in Cold Dark Matter. Here the melancholy longing for the past is even more palpable, not least because the piece hangs in the Victoria and Albert Museum. </p> <p>Monuments and relics litter the yBa landscape: Damien's Hirst's shark, Tracy Emin's bed, Rachel Whiteread's house. Hirst's pickled animals function as trophies, pointing back to their life before being immobilised in a glass box. Away From the Flock , his perfectly preserved spring lamb, also elicits a very English vision of green rolling hills. With Tracy Emin, it is her bitter memories of her Margate childhood and adolescence that are evoked. Everyone I Have Ever Slept With was a tent in which the names of lovers, friends and family were embroidered, part diary, part monument. The now notori ous installation, My Bed is accompanied by used condoms, used tampons, empty vodka bottles. The objects, like the filthy, crumpled sheets, have no future except as museum relics. A Polaroid photograph of the artist gathers dust on the bedside table as if to emphasise this fact. The face is smiling and healthy, documenting happier times before those evidenced by the bed. No part of the artist's personal history is too small or too large to escape transfer to the art gallery; Emin has kept the cigarette packet her uncle was holding when he died in a car crash. </p> <p>In an extraordinary accident, which connects with Cold Dark Matter, the shed and the tent met a violent end, consumed by the recent fire in a London warehouse. Years earlier, the destruction, this time intentional, of another yBa icon took place not far away in a park in Bow. Rachel Whiteread's House was a concrete cast of a demolished house. For a few weeks in 1993 it stood as a sad reminder of an anonymous family's terraced home, before the demolition men moved in. </p> <p>Parker has lived in a condemned house, a dwelling due for destruction to make way for a motorway. The shed is somehow a surrogate home, a movable structure that paradoxically becomes permanent at the bottom of the garden. More fragile than a house, it nevertheless functions - like the beach hut or the womb-like space of the tent - as a refuge from the world or as a repository for things we cannot quite deal with. </p> <p>A few months after Margaret's death we scattered her ashes over a Cornish cliff. I remember watching the grey powder drift in the wind for a second and then disappear, leaving sea, sky and space. We will sort through her belongings one day soon. For the moment we are keeping them in the shed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Winner Sumantro Ghose, 39,lives in London.

  "<p>I have an eyrie in Glasgow. I'm on the top floor of one of the old tenements with a view of the chimney tops. When I was a kid, I lived up the road, and this street had a reputation for drug dealers and prostitutes. Now the whole street's full of thespians and designers and religious communes, so perhaps not that much has changed.</p> <p>Two doors up to the right is the Society for Transcendental Meditation; window frames and door and van parked outside, all painted a matching shade of sunshine yellow. Two doors up to the left, is the house where the Scottish colourist, John Duncan Fergusson, used to live. The living room still contains a wall-length mirror where Fergusson's dark-eyed wife, the dancer Margaret Morris, practised making pirouettes against the background of the black marble fireplace.</p> <p>Their drawing room has so many windows that the room is freezing in winter, but is blessed with a prospect over the park to the university. Fergusson painted the view, letting the image from his windows live long after he had abandoned the house. It was started during the Blitz, and a shard of glass from his Clouston Street studio windows split the canvas. He repaired it and gave the work to Glasgow University. Now it hangs in the Hunterian art gallery.</p> <p>Spring in Glasgow has a buxom Flora with pencilled eyebrows and Max Factor lips standing in front of a panorama of Glasgow's west end, akin to a cool-coloured Nice. Patched and truncated above a network of trees, there is the dome of Kibble Palace: a Byzantine bosom; a hill - Hillhead? Dowanhill? - (although both are impossible to see from Clouston Street) bedecked with a lonely pillar, like a sentinel outside the city; and there is the university spire standing erect, splitting the sky in two beside Flora's head as she cocks us a blank gaze.</p> <p>The sky of Fergusson's Spring in Glasgow is recognisably that of evening light after rain. Flesh-flushed clouds hold back heaven promising to burst again. These are not the dilettante fumes of the south of France. These clouds are used to washing streets, to blasting the pigeon shit from your window ledge.</p> <p>If you go straight on past the mini-roundabout at the end of Clouston Street, the road goes over the bridge and turns into Kirklee. Kirklee had its quotient of artists and writers, too. \"The Studio\" marks the house where Benno Schotz, the sculptor, lived. I have a faint memory, if not an outright fantasy, of going to visit him when I was a child. I remember a dark room with windows overlooking trees. In the shadows were figures on plinths, and half-finished on turntables, all of them globular and alive. And Schotz himself, all fingers and a shock of hair, though this might be my own made-up legend rather than fact.</p> <p>Mrs Kay, who used to clean our house when I was young, cleaned Schotz's, too. Mrs Kay was the inspiration for the angel that gazes down at the congregation with furious love above the altar at St Charles's church, up the road. Schotz's terracotta sculptures, representing Christ's journey to the cross, line every wall of Coia's simple church.</p> <p>Schotz's sculptures are elsewhere in Glasgow. But my favourite is in a quiet patch a step away from an abandoned putting green. It's in a glade by the river, upstaged by other, louder, Victorian sculptures, between the Western Infirmary and the university, easily missed. A bronze twig, Schotz's The Psalmist is a tree-figure made of gnarled green metal branches. His head becomes his body becomes his arms becomes his staff. He might be a shepherd or a musician playing a lyre. He is both ancestor and contemporary; the old world and the new.</p> <p>Stanley Spencer is more famous for belonging to Port Glasgow, down the coast, than to the West End but he lodged in Coleburn Place, too, down the road. In the basement, the Hunterian presents a small Visitation. An awkward girl shies away from a fearsome angel dressed as a nanny, blue and white frocked, starched and scary. Spenser turned the whole of Glasgow upside down, like a schoolgirl turning somersaults on a bar, her patterned skirt billowing up like a hot air balloon.</p> <p>Today is May and I'm looking out of my eyrie kitchen window at the sky. Along the rim of the houses that edge the hill of Fergus Drive, the blue's so bright and almost white that it hurts your eyes. It's the palest aquamarine, the colour of babies and promise, just a hint, nothing formed. Where the chimneys are, it's deeper, a solid matter-of-fact children's drawing of the sky the colour of chunky scribbled crayons in chubby fingers. And up, furthest, at the edge of my window frame before it turns into my kitchen ceiling, the blue's gone all ethereal: a Renaissance Madonna's cloak, majestic. Centuries past, when people looked at the sky they thought it was liquid. The sky itself, they thought, was wet. It had biblical authority, from Genesis.</p> <p>People thought that celestial streams rained down from the heavens affecting the very skin and hair of man, influencing the vigour and growth of plants and trees, getting into the dust of rocks and stones. We've known that all along in Glasgow. The dear green place has never lacked for water. Schotz's sculpture The Psalmist, standing by the river, knows it. Composing on a lyre, this woody Christ is listening to heaven while he plays the music of the earth.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Runner-up Kate Robinson, 39, is a Glasgow-based sculptor who has just returned from working in Portugal</p>",
  "<p><strong> Extreme Measures: The Dark Visions and Bright Ideas of Francis Galton</strong> <br>by Martin Brookes <br>298pp, Bloomsbury, \u00a316.99 </p> <p>Mr Gradgrind, the teacher in Dickens's novel Hard Times, sums up his life's philosophy in terms of what can be measured with a ruler and calculated in units of time. For Gradgrind, culture, art and poetry are mere frippery, a waste of space. Francis Galton, in Martin Brookes's biography, reminds one irresistibly of Gradgrind, forever measuring: the dimensions of noses, the strength of hand grip, the number of minutes he spends looking at a picture his sister has painted for him - and the number of brush strokes required to create a portrait. Quantity determines quality. But in Galton, Gradgrind merges with another figure, the mad inventor of Heath Robinson devices. Galton's bicycle speedometer, for example, required the rider to measure the diameter of his wheels, and count and time their revolutions with a hand-held hourglass as he rode. Scarcely surprisingly, it doesn't seem to have caught on. The same was true for virtually all the cranky proposals and inventions that Galton published over his long life. With, however, one notable exception, that for which his name is still mainly remembered - eugenics. </p> <p>Born in 1822, Galton was part of the intermarrying dynasty descended from that astonishingly creative group of Midland entrepreneurs, inventors, scientists and freethinkers that constituted the famous Lunar Society at the end of the 18th century. Charles Darwin's grandfather Erasmus was a member, as was the gun manufacturer and banker Samuel Galton. Francis, Samuel's grandson, was Charles's cousin. A youngest, cosseted child, treated by his older sisters as an infant prodigy, he was reading Latin by the time he was four. Forced through a variety of unsatisfactory schools by his father, he studied medicine for a time before going to Cambridge to read maths. There, he came up against what would turn out to be his lifelong problem: clever and hard working though he was, others seemed effortlessly to achieve the intellectual mastery of their subjects that he struggled with, and he collapsed with what was to be the first of a series of breakdowns that would recur throughout his life. </p> <p>The death of his banker father left him independently wealthy and spared him the trouble of working for a living. But whereas his many siblings seem to have been content to live off their wealth as English country gentlefolk, Galton's demons drove him into feverish activity, initially as a travelling milord jaunting through Egypt with equally idle companions, where, as Brookes suggests, a casual sexual encounter may have been responsible for his subsequent infertility. He failed in one crucial gentlemanly respect, however. He was a rotten shot, managing even to miss the hippos he aimed at. Ashamed of his failure, he practised hard at his shooting, eventually graduating through the massacre of thousands of game birds to the point where he could finally kill (and eat) a giraffe. </p> <p>Brookes suggests that it was the impact of Darwin's Origin, published in 1859, that transformed Galton from a dilettante explorer with conventional Victorian views on race, class, sex and imperialism, giving him a new intellectual direction. Heredity, he decided, determined all. In his key book, Hereditary Genius, published a decade after his cousin's great opus, Galton traced the lives of eminent Victorians, showing that judges, bishops and scientists tended to have fathers who were themselves judges, bishops or scientists - convincing evidence that genius was inherited in the male line. Futhermore, the English possessed this attribute to a greater extent than any other European nation, to say nothing of the \"swarms\" of other coloured folk whose \"jabbering\" he could not understand. </p> <p>Despite the extent to which Galton's claims may have massaged Englishmen's self-image, Brookes cites the many doubting and critical reviews that followed its publication. Undeterred, over the subsequent 40 years Galton refined his arguments, developing statistical procedures to bolster them and a variety of anthropometric measures to go alongside them. Concerned that the less intelligent classes and races were outbreeding their betters, he argued for a programme of inducements for the finest human specimens to mate, and invented the term eugenics to summarise his philosophy. He made his case in an unending stream of polemics, books and even a (fortunately unpublished) utopian fantasy. </p> <p>By the beginning of the last century, the eugenic movement was attracting a motley group of supporters from widely different political backgrounds, although the newly established Sociological Association remained sceptical. Galton's last years brought a knighthood, and the establishment of a laboratory at University College London that still bears his name, though no longer that of eugenics, which was expunged in disrepute following its Nazi apotheosis. </p> <p>Brookes, who worked in the Galton lab before becoming a biographer, has tapped into a vast archive of Galtoniana, although I can't understand how his editors allowed him to get away without a single reference or even an index. Kindly editing would also have excised the first and last rather embarrassingly self-referential chapters. None the less, for sheer wealth of revealing, cranky detail of a quintessentially Victorian life in all its horrifically prejudiced detail, he has produced a fascinating account. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Steven Rose's new book, The 21st-Century Brain, will be published early next year by Cape.</p>",
  "<p>\"Pitt was a politician par excellence,\" observed Simon Sebag Montefiore in the Daily Telegraph, reviewing William Hague's William Pitt the Younger, \"so much in control that he could vomit out of the door of the Commons and recover to make a superb oration.\" Of the many parallels between Hague and Pitt rehearsed by reviewers, Brendan Simms in the Sunday Times noted that \"Pitt consumed about three bottles of port a day [and] Hague once notoriously claimed to have downed 14 pints in a day\". However, John Adamson in the Sunday Telegraph objected to Hague's \"anachronistic sense that the Commons was the only political forum in Hanoverian England that mattered\", overlooking the powerful court of George III. Meanwhile, Alastair Horne in the Times mourned Hague's truncated political career and cursed \"those buffoons who affect to run the Tory party\" for depriving the nation of a leader.</p> <p>Oh, Play That Thing, Roddy Doyle's sequel to A Star Called Henry, was savaged by Tom Deveson in the Sunday Times as a \"derivative and unsatisfactory novel... slack dialogue, warmed-up clich\u00e9s and tedious plotting make the second-hand nature of the writing all too evident\". \"His fast American vernacular never feels nearly as natural as his Dublin,\" agreed Robert Hanks in the Daily Telegraph, \"after a while the temptation is to skip the dialogue and go to the description, a bizarre inversion of the natural order of things.\" Cole Moreton in the Independent on Sunday complained that the dialogue is sometimes \"hard to follow, even incomprehensible, until the reader is left disoriented and gasping for the sweet air of clarity like an exhausted flapper dizzied by the drums and the dope\". </p> <p>\"Fathers and Sons... will appeal to Bron and Evelyn fans alike,\" declared Lynn Barber in the Daily Telegraph of the new book by Alexander Waugh, son of Auberon and grandson of Evelyn, but \"on no account should it be read as a guide to parenting - encouraging children to lie, to drink alcohol from an early age, and to eschew all serious conversation might work for the Waughs but not, I feel, for the general population.\" \"All fathers of sons should read it,\" said Humphrey Carpenter in the Sunday Times, while in the Spectator Andro Linklater thought that \"the saga of the Waughs will convince the most cynical to support the late Princess Diana's campaign for more hugging\".</p>",
  "<p>Who is the most flattering painter in the world? I was once at a party when everyone nominated their personal choice of artist who would give them immortality while at the same time bearing at least a modest relationship to reality. Renoir, Sargent, Van Dyck (think what he did for the monkey-like Henrietta Maria), even Picasso were names I remember being mentioned, as well as the chic and extremely elderly woman who went for Rembrandt on the grounds that he had loved his old mother. Immersed in Restoration studies at the time, I chose Lely who \"on an animated canvas stole/the sleepy eye that spoke the melting soul\". The odd thing is, in retrospect, that no one chose Fran\u00e7ois Boucher. </p> <p>As a new exhibition at the Wallace Collection, aptly entitled Seductive Visions (accompanied by a sumptuous catalogue by Jo Hedley), makes clear, Boucher was surely the most beguiling painter who ever lived, capable of giving the most pleasure to the client - and presumably the sitter too. It is good that the Wallace Collection, with its astonishing array of Boucher's works, not only pictures and miniatures, but the decorative arts in quantity, confronts us anew with Boucher's \"visions\". Somehow, the fatal words \"chocolate boxy\" have got attached to his name (too many reproductions and, yes, too many chocolate boxes) in modern times. Even in his own time, his popularity was so great that le go\u00fbt Boucher was in danger of being a term of derision among (possibly jealous) highbrows. Designing Easter eggs for Louis XV was considered unserious. And then there was his fatal association with the Ancien Regime after the Revolution. </p> <p>There was much unfairness in this relegation of Boucher to some aristocratic past, at least in terms of his own background and climb to fame. Boucher was the supreme meritocrat. He worked intensely hard all his life and produced an enormous output. The son of a hack painter (\"a simple lad\"), he had no powerful friends to forward his interests, and when he won a prize at the French Academy of Painting which should have guaranteed him a paid trip to Rome to study, a better-connected student went instead. Nevertheless, Boucher managed to reach Rome under his own steam, and there he developed what can only be described as the confidence of the budding genius. </p> <p>In order to call attention to himself and his art, Boucher painted two enormous history pictures without commission from a patron. These history pictures belonged to a classical mode developed in the previous reign. To them (shown centrally in the exhibition), the young Boucher brought his own superb sense of paint and joy, the palette of delicate clear blues and orangey-pink, the happiness and confidence of the characters. </p> <p>In Mercury Confiding the Infant Bacchus to the Nymphs, you have no doubt that a good time is going to be had by all, whereas the great classical pictures, say, of Le Brun under Louis XIV seem to indicate scenes of off-putting and remote formality that leave the beholder bowing towards the frame. Similarly, in The Rape of Europa, the bull is an adorable creature, its curly head wreathed in flowers, a complacent expression in its wide-apart eyes. As a few disappointed and unwreathed bulls disappear into the background, found wanting in the god department, once again delight is in the air. It was Boucher's ability to convey this sense of pleasure - this douceur de vivre that Talleyrand dreamily said no one who had not lived before the French Revolution could understand - that brought him such worldly success. </p> <p>Yet once again Boucher has been too easily conflated with his art. Because he painted marvellous (and surely very erotic) pictures of young girls with dimpled flesh spread out on their stomachs, it was assumed that he himself was a libertine. Similarly, he was accused of acting as pander for Madame de Pompadour, acting as their \"Raphael\" in depicting the young girls whom the ageing, still lecherous, King Louis XV might enjoy in his private teenage brothel known as Le Parc aux Cerfs. It is true that this brothel existed - Louis XV thought young inexperienced girls would be free from disease. It is also true that Madame de Pompadour, a pragmatic woman if ever there was one, cleverly divorced the sexual role of mistress from that of ma\u00eetresse en t\u00eetre, leaving the hard work of the former to the younger generation. </p> <p>But Boucher himself was not a libertine in the current sense of the word. (In the 18th century, libertinage meant the pursuit of pleasure not debauchery.) He was in love with his wife, one of the most beautiful women in Paris and famously virtuous. Boucher also took steps to make his young models bring chaperones. Furthermore, one of his favourite models acted in that capacity for 25 years, indicating that Boucher's own tastes should not be equated with those of the monarch he served. </p> <p>For all Boucher's personal rectitude, it was the association with Madame de Pompadour - who became the ultimate symbol of \"female degeneracy\" at the Revolution - that gave him his historical immortality as it gave her the supreme, managed expression of her image. Boucher had to share the condemnation as he had shared the celebration. Fortunately, Pompadour died too soon, in 1764, to suffer, and Boucher died in 1770 a few weeks after the 14-year-old Marie Antoinette reached France. (What a delightful picture of her he would have made!) Louis XV's last mistress, the Du Barry, was still alive, and perished under the guillotine for the pleasure she had given the previous monarch. </p> <p>Recently, there has been emphasis on Pompadour's use of \"spin\", to use the fashionable word, in presenting herself to the public, perhaps to distract from her low birth. Christine Pevitt Algrant, in her fascinating biography Madame de Pompadour: Mistress of France (2002), writes of the association of painter and mistress in its second stage (Pompadour no longer content to be merely Venus Goddess of Love, but also Goddess of Friendship): \"The marquise was already very concerned about her place in history. She wanted to be remembered as the protector of the arts in France.\" Boucher was her ideal amanuensis. </p> <p>Hedley, however, in her catalogue, points to another direction in which Pompadour worked with Boucher to improve, or in this case, radically change her image. When Louis XIV's wife, the Spanish Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, died in 1683, the King, in his prime at the age of 45, was expected to marry some other European princess. Instead, he contracted a so-called morganatic marriage with Fran\u00e7oise d'Aubign\u00e9, created Marquise de Maintenon, a woman of no great birth, of embarrassing Huguenot background, and the widow of a disreputable poet. What Maintenon did have to put against these disadvantages was genuine piety, gravitas, and a gift for friendship. </p> <p>All this opened up exciting possibilities in Pompadour's ever-ambitious mind: Louis XIV's only son had also contracted a morganatic marriage after the death of his royal wife. If Louis XV's Queen Marie Leczinska died, might not Pompadour aspire to be the Queen of France as well as the Mistress? Friendship and fidelity the former Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson could do. One of the most exquisite portraits of her, the pride of the Wallace Collection, features a spaniel that symbolised fidelity - she was ever faithful to the King even if he was not faithful to her. But gravitas? </p> <p>Gamely, Pompadour commissioned works of art from Boucher which deliberately alluded to the celebrated imagery of the Grand Si\u00e8cle, Apollo so closely identified with Louis XIV, now seen in The Rising and the Setting of the Sun with the \"beauteous nymph who had stolen the god's heart\" aka Jeanne-Antoinette. Alas for this plan, it was the Pompadour not the Queen who died. </p> <p>In a further important respect, Boucher was incorrectly associated with the traditional laziness and profligacy of the Ancien Regime. He was a man of enormous intellectual curiosity about a world in which art and science had not yet become divided. The contents of his Natural History cabinet - his collection of shells, minerals, corals and other objects of natural history - constituted a quarter of his wealth at his death. His interest extended to exotic peoples of the world, even if his geographical notions were imprecise: his sets for Rameau's opera Les Indes Galantes included, in a worldwide sweep, Peruvian Incas as well as Turks and Africans. </p> <p>It is this adventurousness of spirit, his need for observation of nature, that really transforms the work of Boucher and makes him a true man of the 18th century and the Enlightenment. And then there is his ability to make of his sitters \"seductive visions\". As Voltaire wrote: \"It is not a little thing to give pleasure.\" </p> <p>Antonia Fraser is the author of Marie Antoinette (Random House). Boucher: Seductive Visions is at the Wallace Collection, London W1, from September 30. Details: 020-7563 9500; <a href=\"http://www.wallacecollection.org\">wallacecollection.org</a></p>",
  "<p>The Hamilton Case, by Michelle de Kretser (Vintage, \u00a36.99) </p> <p> Ridiculed at school and starved of his mother's affection, Sam Obeysekere grows up to be a public prosecutor in 1930s Ceylon. All he wants is justice, and his rightful place in the upper echelons of society. Solving the Hamilton case - the murder of a rich British planter - is both his moment of glory and his realisation that what he wants will always elude him. His self-aggrandising memoir forms part of Michelle de Kretser's second novel, a postmodern mix of historical murder mystery, family saga and self-referential literary work. The lush, multilayered narrative oozes with the \"routine reek of damp and rot, the bass note of the tropics\" and reveals the mouldy core at the heart of Ceylon during British colonial rule. De Kretser, a Sri Lankan by birth, is fabulously evocative of place. She weaves an exotic, if mannered, tale of pompous men, sensual women and misfit children. <strong> ES</strong> </p> <p> <strong> My Name is Light, by Elsa Osorio, translated by Catherine Jagoe (Bloomsbury, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> During Argentina's \"dirty war\" of the 1970s, 30,000 people were \"disappeared\" - tortured and killed - for opposing the far-right military junta. Among them were hundreds of pregnant women, many of whose babies were born and died in prison. Luz is one of those babies, but while her mother is shot and her father exiled, she is adopted by a wealthy couple who conceal her origins. As Luz matures, she feels ever more ill at ease with her family - especially her grandfather, a former general - until her conviction that she is not \"one of them\" becomes a certainty. The birth of her own child awakens memories of the traumatic first weeks of her life, and sets her off on a quest for her true identity. Argentinian writer Elsa Osoriotells the story in the voices of, among others, Luz, her adoptive father and the prostitute who befriended her mother. Weaving past and present, the novel is as much an emotional family drama as a damning account of a dark moment in history. <strong> ES</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Internationals, by Sarah May (Vintage, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> An international is \"someone who loses his home through choice, and whose experience is meant to be valid to those who have lost their homes, or worse, against their will\". This is the pep talk a journalist, on his latest posting to the former Yugoslavia, gives to a former estate agent hoping to do some good. They are just two of the many whose lives converge near a refugee camp during the 1999 Kosovo crisis. Sarah May's third novel features tireless aid workers, decadent diplomats, corrupt officials and dispossessed locals. Pieced together, their stories make up a collage of the weeks from the start of Nato air strikes to the withdrawal of Serb forces. May is good on reportage, short on analysis. Her narrative skims the surface, and the generous sprinkling of characters hampers engagement with any in particular. As one of her own characters says, better to tell the story of one girl rescued from her smoking home than to try to process the bigger picture until it is easily digestible. <strong> ES</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Fountain at the Centre of the World, by Robert Newman (Verso, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p> Globalisation is the subject of Robert Newman's ambitious, accomplished third novel, so it's fitting that his characters are connected by world-spanning chains of cause and effect. Evan is a high-powered, amoral PR executive with a terminal illness, Chano is a disillusioned Mexican activist who has lost his wife and son to state brutality, and Daniel is a fatherless boy on a Costa Rican fishing boat. All their lives are entangled in a complex story rich in coincidence and detail. There's no doubt that the anti-globalisation argument is what matters here, but the novel avoids drowning in polemic. Instead, something dramatic and terrible happens every few pages - Newman makes the politics personal, bringing home the humiliations and alienations that power imposes on the powerless and writing about the 1999 \"battle of Seattle\" with invigorating anger, excitement and hope. <strong> ST</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Diary, by Chuck Palahniuk (Vintage, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> Poor Misty. Once she was a penniless but promising art student, then she married blue-blooded, old-moneyed Peter Wilmot, who took her away to exclusive Waytansea Island. Now the money has gone, she's a downtrodden hotel maid with a drink problem, Peter is comatose after a botched suicide attempt, and angry islanders are complaining that rooms are missing from their houses. Peter has been walling them off after decorating their interiors with hateful graffiti - and things have barely even begun to get weird. The townspeople have a plan for Misty that sends Diary spiralling out of the realm of mundane despair and into that of crazed American gothic. Palahniuk's prose is heavily mannered, but rather than becoming annoying, this drags us all the more effectively into his world. There are distinct traces of Rosemary's Baby here, but Palahniuk's unblinking eye for the strange makes this poisonous fable original as well as horrifying. <strong> ST</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Moon, by Jeremy Gavron (Scribner, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> First published in 1996, this nostalgic picture of a childhood in 1950s Africa remains fresh and involving. The unnamed narrator, looking back from lonely middle age in England, tells the story of growing up as a white boy on a Kenyan farm, and of his relationship with Ernest, a young black mechanic unusual enough to befriend him: Ernest \"who failed properly to understand the rules, who talked too much\". There is much affection for the lost experiences of this life - the isolated farmstead, shooting a leopard, going to the pictures in Nairobi, English-style boarding-school - but there is also a penetrating account of the colonial tensions riddling the country, and of the ensuing \"trouble\" that engulfs it with atrocious consequences for both Ernest and the narrator's family. Gavron writes with unshowy craftsmanship and deftly unfolds an atmospheric story, thanks to his skill at evoking the impressions of a child seeing more than he understands. ST</p>",
  "Should you find yourself in a country pub tonight, glance up at the walls. Most likely, they will be ornamented with prints of horsemen in pink coats leaping across fences, streams and green fields. Even in the 21st century, a host of landlords believe that such images epitomise the spirit of the English countryside. <p>For a moment, let us put aside familiar arguments about the morality of foxhunting. Instead consider the weird, extravagant culture which has played so large a part in English rural life for centuries, and which was so eagerly consigned to oblivion by the Labour benches on Wednesday. </p> <p>Think of the painters who have depicted Englishmen and their horses and dogs: Stubbs, Wootton, Alken, Herring. Reflect upon the writers, from Fielding and Trollope to Sassoon and Kipling, who have scaled lyrical heights to celebrate the joy of riding a fine horse hard across country amid the music of the hounds. </p> <p>Virginia Woolf, no friend of rustic savages, mused with puzzled admiration about the impact of fox-hunters upon English literature: \"In their slapdash, gentlemanly way, they have ridden their pens as boldly as they have ridden their horses. They have had their effect upon the language. This riding and tumbling, this being blown upon and rained upon and splashed from head to foot with mud, have worked themselves into the very texture of English prose and given it that leap and dash, that stripping of images from flying hedge and tossing tree which distinguish it.\" </p> <p>Anthony Trollope observed that no rural activity did more to bring together every kind of person in the countryside: \"Attorneys, country bankers, bakers, innkeepers, auctioneers, graziers, builders, retired officers, judges home from India, barristers who take weekly holidays, stockbrokers, newspaper editors, artists and sailors.\" </p> <p>No man captured the view of England from the saddle better than Siegfried Sassoon. \"The mornings I remember most zestfully were those which took us up on to the chalk downs,\" he wrote in Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man. \"To watch the day breaking from purple to dazzling gold while we trotted up a deep-rutted lane; to inhale the early freshness when we were on the sheep-cropped uplands; to stare back at the low country with its cock-crowing farms and mist-coiled waterways; thus to be riding out with a sense of spacious discovery - was it not something stolen from a lie-a-bed world and the luckless city workers?\" </p> <p>Trollope portrayed foxhunting squires with affection, but without illusions about their philistinism. Mr Spooner of Spoon Hall \"could read, and always looked at the country newspaper; but a book was a thing that he couldn't bear\". Surtees's fox-hunting novels gave 19th-century literature one of its most delightfully named heroines, Lucy Glitters, together with a peerlessly funny picture of country life's parvenus, rogues and bounders. </p> <p>The most famous fox-hunter in literature is Surtees's humble grocer Mr Jorrocks, who proclaimed the virtues of country life with characteristic exuberance: \"London's a good place, to be sure, but oh my beloved 'earers, there is no misery like that of solitude in a crowd, or inconwenience like that of livin' with men without being able to afford to partak o' their plissures. London's the rich man's paradise, the poor man's puggatory.\" </p> <p>Many rustic fox-hunters hated visiting London swells. \"A lot of noisy, perfumed, chattering coxcombs,\" Surtees observed in disgust. The keenest sportsmen, then as now, cared nothing for an exquisite turnout and fashionable conversation. They were monastically devoted to the breeding and working of horses and hounds. </p> <p>They were brave, often idiotically so. They fell, fell, and fell again, hurtling over the big fences and into the bogs, thinking life or limb well lost in the sacred quest. They bonked a lot. Fox-hunting and adultery are inseparably entwined. Those of us who live in the country yet are rotten horsemen have always been madly jealous of the success with women of a good man to hounds. His cheques may bounce, he may have the brain of a pea, but if he \"goes well\" he never lacks female worshippers. The complexity of some fox-hunters' love lives is amazing, hence my favourite hunting story. </p> <p>Two men out with the Quorn saw two women fall heavily into a ditch on the far side of a field. One man said: \"Oh God, I'd better go and take a look. One of those women is my wife and the other one is my mistress.\" The other man demurred. \"I'll go,\" he said, and cantered across to inspect the wreckage. A few minutes later he was back. Glancing impassively at his companion, he observed thoughtfully: \"Small world, isn't it?\" </p> <p>If all this seems intolerably boorish, reflect upon some hounds' names: Grappler and Groper, Bracken and Bracket, Guilty and Gusty, Willow and Wistful. Then there are famous coverts, which have harboured foxes since time immemorial, and are etched into each country's social fabric: Barkly Holt and John o'Gaunt's, Askham Bog and Court House Spring, Bilborough Gorse and Rougemont Carr. </p> <p>Here is Trollope again, in Phineas Redux, describing a meet: \"Carriages were drawn up on all the roads, and horses were clustered on each side of the brook, and the hounds sat stately on their haunches, and there was a hum of merry voices, and the bright colouring of pink coats, and the sheen of ladies' hunting toilettes, and that mingled look of business and amusement which is so peculiar to our national sports. </p> <p>\"Two hundred men and women had come there for the chance of a run after a fox - for a chance against which the odds are more than two-to-one at every hunting day. When we give a guinea for a stall at the opera, we think that we pay a large sum; but we are fairly sure of having our music. When you go to Copperhouse Cross you are by no means sure of your music.\" </p> <p>Even early in the 20th century, Kipling observed the irony that cars kill far more foxes than hunters. He wrote in disgust: </p> <p>Then every road was made a rink </p> <p>For Coroners to sit on: </p> <p>And so began in skid and stink, </p> <p>The real blood sport of Britain! </p> <p>Foxhunting never had much to do with pest control. The sport was always about the thrill of the chase, just as its abolition has little to do with animal welfare, and everything to do with extinguishing fox-hunters. </p> <p>\"My soul's on fire and eager for the chase!\", exulted Mr Jorrocks. \"By heavens, I declare I've dreamt of nothing else all night.\" Jorrocks's descendants will have to dream about ten-pin bowling. Our new ruling establishment is committed to an urban and suburban monoculture. Nothing I have written above would prompt even a pang of doubt among Wednesday's zealots. They respect personal liberty, and the values of others, only as far as these things do not infringe their own prejudices. </p> <p>Soon, the only survivals of a batty yet wonderfully colourful heritage will be pubs named the Fox And Hounds. Perhaps Mr Tony Banks and his friends will feel more comfortable when these, too, are suppressed, replaced by some ideal New Labour niterie christened The Halal Butcher. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Contrary to prejudice in the soft south the mid-week sun shines down fiercely on Hartlepool from a Mediterranean blue sky. This proudly isolated town of nearly 100,000 people on the northern edge of the Tees Valley is long past its years of industrial decline when the steel works and shipyards went. <p>Pockets of unemployment and petty crime, often drug related, persist. But there are posh eateries and estates where house prices doubled in a year. All this in sight of sea and rugged hills. </p> <p>The new marina is full of boats and tourists come to visit the heritage harbour. This month, though, the town's Grand Hotel is booked out with a different kind of visitor. In under a fortnight Hartlepool will choose an MP to replace Peter Mandelson, who has left for Brussels. </p> <p>The timing, chosen by the government, could not be more delicate. The poll takes place on September 30, the last day of the Labour party conference and just before the Tories gather in Bournemouth. The outcome could set the political mood for the rest of the year. </p> <p>Local printers are working overtime to leaflet the town for all 10 candidates. But who will become the town's fourth MP since 1959? According to this week's Channel 4 News/NOP poll it will be Iain Wright, the very local Labour candidate. </p> <p>Among those likely to vote he leads his Lib Dem rival, Jody Dunn, by 53% to 20% with Ukip hard on Tory heels for third place, a potential humiliation for a party that once came close to taking the seat. </p> <p>Labour byelection managers have sniffed the wind and are taking no chances. They are right. A Guardian straw poll on York Road, where at least four of the contenders have rented empty shops for the campaign, suggests that enough Labour voters plan to defect or stay at home to dispel any complacency. </p> <p>Crime and the closure or downsizing of Hartlepool's bustling three-star hospital, not foxhunting or Iraq, agitate most Hartlepudlians. As Britain's new EU commissioner Mr Mandelson could prove a good friend to the town. But compared with the fate of the hospital (\"Jody Demands Answers\" shouts the Lib Dem campaign newspaper) his legacy will not be decisive. </p> <p>An elderly Tory admits \"He was quite good, despite being Labour.\" An NHS manager says: \"He cleaned the town up.\" \"He was a very good constituency MP,\" confirms a youthful Labour stalwart. </p> <p>Such tributes are not unanimous. \"He was brilliant, but he had his own agenda\" and \"he wasn't working for Hartlepool, he was working for himself,\" say other voters, but only when they are prompted. </p> <p>The factor now at work here is parochialism: a reaction to his fame. The town wants a local, local MP. The Tory candidate, Jeremy Middleton, an entrepreneur all the way from Newcastle, capitalises on this feeling. Look how many cabinet ministers have represented this corner of the north east - Blair next door to Mandelson at Sedgefield, Mo Mowlam at Redcar, Alan Milburn in Darlington - he says. Yet it has not had its share of regeneration money compared with the billions poured into Newcastle/Gateshead 30 miles up the A1(M). And it was Margaret Thatcher's now-defunct Teesside development corporation which turned Hartlepool around and built the marina, says Mr Middleton (and others). </p> <p>Britain's thriving anti-politics zeitgeist offers one striking paradox: it doesn't prevent a clutch of impressive, if masochistic, candidates coming forward. One such is Mr Middleton, picked late after defeatist Tory talk and struggling to save Michael Howard from humiliation here with slogans like Crackdown on Crime. Mr Middleton wears smart-casual clothes with frameless titanium specs. He came north to Newcastle 20 years ago. His plumbing firm is quoted on the stock exchange. </p> <p>But so strong is the local factor that the man challenging him for third place, Ukip's Stephen Allison, 44 took his birth certificate to Labour HQ to prove he was born in the town. Issues like toxic waste, a second possible nuclear power plant and the famously polluted US \"ghost ships\" waiting to be dismantled in Hartlepool dock, lurk in the background and worry Mr Allison as well as Respect's John Bloom. \"But this election is all about who is the most local,\" complains Mr Allison. </p> <p>Labour's Iain Wright is local. His family uses the hospital too. It will soon deliver his fourth child. \"It's as important to me as to anyone,\" he says. \"Hospital safe says Blair\" (and John Reid) declare campaign leaflets that \"expose\" the Lib Dems as soft on petty crime and yobs. It is a Labour technique refined in the Hodge Hill and Leicester byelections with mixed success. </p> <p><b> Jokers</b><br> </p> <p>Freckled and cheerful, the Labour candidate looks like one of William Brown's gang of Outlaws, albeit a disciplined Outlaw who wisely sticks to the New Labour line. Mr Wright is likely to be the next MP. But there are two significant jokers in the pack. One is Respect's ex-Labour Mr Bloom, as local as anyone (but not saying so), liked and respected as Hartlepool's anti-nuclear, pro-hospital campaigner. </p> <p>A former care worker, his small team (\"our 30 experienced local activists are more than Labour or the Lib Dems can muster\") call him a secular saint. In his York Road office he talks with thoughtful despair about the party he left. Dillu Miah, a Muslim taxi driver, will defect from Labour to Mr Bloom because of Iraq. But there are barely 500 Muslim votes in Hartlepool. </p> <p>A more potent threat is poised by the Lib Dem's Ms Dunn. A family court barrister, 35, multi-lingual and a mother of four, she has worked in Hartlepool for six years. That may neutralise her London origins and - worse - her residence in a village just outside Hartlepool's rival, Darlington. </p> <p>Ms Dunn seems less at ease close-up than her rivals. It may be because Labour is faking outrage over a reckless attempt at humour on her website. \"We began to realise that everyone we met was either drunk, flanked by an angry dog or undressed,\" she blithely wrote. \"Outrage at candidate's insult to town,\" cried Labour. Taken from context, Lib Dems protest. </p> <p>\"The non-Labour vote will coalesce around Jody, she's fantastic,\" predicts the Lib Dem elections ace, Lord Rennard. With lots of luck he might be right. </p> <p>One voter, William Hunter, 59, says he likes to vote for the person, not the party and is undecided. The smartly-dressed woman hurrying down York Road seems undecided too: \"I don't have any political views, we just vote Labour.\" But Labour can no longer rely on tribal loyalty like that. Mr Wright is working as if his inherited majority of 14,571 is 571. So he should. </p> <p><b> General election 2001</b> </p> <p>P Mandelson (Lab) 22,506; A Robinson (Con) 7,935; N Boddy (Lib Dem) 5,717; A Scargill (SLP) 912; I Cameron (Ind) 557; J Booth (Ind) 424 <b> Lab maj</b> 14,571 <b> Turnout</b> 56.3%</p>",
  "Tony Blair and Ayad Allawi will have a lot to talk about tomorrow when Iraq's interim prime minister visits the UK on his way to the United Nations. The immediate background to their meeting is one of the worst weeks since the formal handover of power in Baghdad at the end of June. The grim tally includes a massive car bombing, US air strikes against insurgents and the targeting of innocent bystanders as well as sinister and well-organised kidnappings of foreigners. All this is taking place more than a year after George Bush so foolishly claimed \"mission accomplished\". Since then, more than 1,000 Americans and an estimated 30,000 Iraqis have met violent deaths. Britain, which has lost more than 60 dead, has 8,500 troops in the south and may, so defence secretary Geoff Hoon signalled yesterday, be preparing to send more. Talk of reconstruction and development sounds like a bad joke. But, like it or not - and most Britons emphatically do not - we are involved up to our necks. <p>Officially, the British government has a clear view of what needs to happen in the coming weeks. The emphasis is on improving security so that country-wide elections can take place on schedule in January. Troop withdrawals could begin in 2005, perhaps ending in 2006. The prospects, to put it mildly, are not good. The worst-case scenario of a US national intelligence estimate leaked in Washington this week includes the possibility of an Iraqi civil war; the milder option is increased fragmentation and extremism, impeding if not preventing efforts to build an effective central government in Baghdad and foster multi-party democracy after 30 years of Ba'athist repression. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, British ministers and officials are deeply worried about the paralysing effects of the current mayhem, whether their emphasis is on the corrosive lack of trust at the domestic political level or the catastrophic situation in Iraq itself. Arguments about the strength of the case for war - the existence or not of WMD, or the irresponsible lack of planning for the post-Saddam era, have not gone away. But enormous problems have to be resolved in the here and now - and the countries that went to war cannot run away from them. </p> <p>Polls show that most Iraqis want to see foreign troops leave their country as soon as possible. Yet to do so before an Iraqi government can even begin to take effective charge could be a recipe for even greater disaster. Insurgent attacks on ordinary Iraqis queueing up to join the police show that clearly enough. It may suit the US and Britain to emphasise the role played by foreign, as opposed to home-grown, resistance fighters. But it was the group led by the notorious Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi - whose trademark is the video beheading of hostages - that claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack on the Baghdad police recruiting station. </p> <p>In this bleak situation, Mr Blair must stress the importance of sticking to the election timetable, even if rebel hotspots like Falluja will not take part. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, caused real anger in London when he suggested that polling could not go ahead if violence persisted, though Mr Annan may yet be right, as Colin Powell, the US secretary of state, acknowledged yesterday. Britain also needs to make clear to Mr Allawi that the election must be as inclusive as possible so that Iraqis have a real choice. Safe candidates who are solely from the anti-Saddam groups backed by the US before the war will not be enough. Risky amnesties for insurgents and a role for powerful Shia radicals like Moqtada al-Sadr will be unavoidable. Mr Hoon, who has hardly covered himself in glory over Iraq, put it well this time: \"Security is crucial to holding elections, but there is also the other side of it, which is that holding elections may well prove crucial to security.\"</p>",
  "This hunting business is a mess. Personally I wouldn't ban it; what could be more hypocritical than someone who eats veal, supermarket eggs or the kind of pork you get in Chinese restaurants complaining about cruelty to animals? On the other hand, if huntspersons like dressing up, having a stiff drink, then belting over the countryside, why do they need to be chasing anything? <p>I couldn't care less about the class thing. The overlap between hunt followers and the people who actually run our lives is minuscule these days, and as for the argument that it must be abolished because it echoes 800-year-old feudal laws - well, that is beyond parody. You might as well ban camping in the New Forest because it evokes the conditions scrofulous peasants lived in at the time of Henry II. </p> <p>In a way I envy all those people who are so certain of their rightness on each side. That though is the real problem in a democracy: how to find a balance between a minority who feel passionately, and a majority who reckon, on balance, on the whole, giving and taking, here and there, that they disagree? We should remember too that if we had listened to the majority we would have capital punishment and homosexuals would still be jailed. </p> <p>What is fascinating is the similarity between the hunt followers and the far left demonstrators in the Thatcher years. Even their haircuts are the same. The only element missing was the Socialist Worker placards, and they might have been in there somewhere. One of the leftie catchphrases then was, \"we tried democracy, but it didn't work\", almost the line peddled on Wednesday. What it means, of course, is \"most people disagree with us, and we can't stand it\". </p> <p>My guess is that when hunting is finally banned, there will be a few rebel hunts, a lot of publicity and some silly court cases, followed by a gradual loss of interest until we wonder what the fuss was all about. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I popped up to Bloomsbury to the launch party for the Cheltenham Literary festival, which starts next month. Some of the hottest tickets, apart from Greg Dyke, whose talk has already sold out, are for politicians. William Hague is on course for an audience of 800, Tony Benn for 700 (he has always sold out in the past, but this is his third consecutive visit) and Neil Kinnock for 600. Roy Hattersley can expect around 400, and even Michael Meacher, who was never in the cabinet nor a party leader, should get up to 300. What they all have in common is that they are no longer in office. We are probably kinder to our politicians than any other large country, but only when they have no power to influence our lives. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I flipped through The Goldfish Bowl, the book by Cherie Booth and Cate Haste, shortly before watching Cherie's interview on the Richard and Judy programme on Channel 4 on Thursday. One of the chapters is about Lady Dorothy Macmillan, who famously broke her husband's heart by having a more or less public affair with Robert Boothby. But in those days couples stuck together anyway, and it was her practice to join Harold on the platform when he was speaking. </p> <p>Once, when Macmillan was foreign secretary, they were in Halifax, supporting their son Maurice in his election campaign. She nodded off on the platform, and someone in the audience shouted, \"Does the speaker know his wife is asleep?\" </p> <p>She woke up and replied: \"My father's a politician, my brother's a politician, my husband's a politician, my son's a politician and my son-in-law is a politician. I've heard it all before. So if you don't mind, I'm going back to sleep.\" Apparently this was met by a roar of approval. </p> <p>Watching Cherie's interview later, I was struck once again by Richard's extraordinary technique. It consists in asking anodyne questions in a convoluted series of apologies as if he were demanding something quite outrageous. It's as if you unwrapped a parcel made of tissue, bubble-wrap and polystyrene peanuts to find inside - cotton wool. Seeing him wriggling round to ask her if she sometimes, occasionally, disagreed with her husband was almost painful, like watching a very nervous anaconda. </p> <p>I wonder how it would be if he really did have to ask something risky. \"I mean, you two, now I probably shouldn't be asking this, and if it's the wrong thing to do please tell me, but, you do have three children, I mean five, four, that's four, four children you have, and - and I hate to raise this and you'll stop me if I shouldn't, I am sure you will, there was a miscarriage, also, in the past, wasn't there - and so, what I'm getting round to is, you do do it, don't you, I mean, 'it', don't you?\" </p> <p>There is little for the interviewee to do except nod blankly and say \"yes\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I also went to the launch of Don Watson's new book Gobbledygook: How Clich\u00e9s, Sludge and Management-Speak are Strangling our Public Language. Professor Watson is Australian, but this kind of nonsense seems to infest the entire English-speaking world. \"Impacting\", \"closure\", \"cross-cutting initiatives\", \"stakeholders\", \"transparency\" and \"implement quality function deployment\" are everywhere. </p> <p>As a connoisseur myself, I asked Don Watson, whose book has been a huge seller in Australia, if he felt the people who used this language knew what it meant. He thought they didn't, but they did know roughly how to make it look as if they did. My view is that this ghastly jargon is like Lego being played with by a toddler. The bits fit together perfectly, and you can go on making bigger and bigger structures which don't fall apart. But they also don't resemble anything at all. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I am chastised in this week's Spectator for a paragraph last week complaining about my absence from the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. My colleague David McKie says there should be a type-face called \"ironic bold\", since irony invariably fails in print, as it clearly did on this occasion. But then, we columnists usually spend more time crafting our own words than bothering to read what we're writing about.</p>",
  "<b> Daily Telegraph</b> <br>Editorial, September 17 <p>\"Paradoxically, having framed his new politics as being an antidote to class war, Tony Blair is now making an attack on country pursuits, which is a spasm of unreconstructed class vengeance. This anomalous position is a direct consequence of his own bad faith. The atavistic left wing of his party has been forced to accept a leader who is out of sympathy with most of its own political instincts. To prevent it eating him alive, Mr Blair must occasionally toss it a bone. It is the fate of country people - for whom he has little sympathy and less understanding - to be that sop.</p> <p>\"This misadventure goes to the heart of Blairite government: exclusively metropolitan in perspective, obsessed with making headlines, prone to ruthless bullying to get its [own] way - and ultimately cowardly when it comes to accepting the consequences of its own actions.\" </p> <p><b> Patrick O'Flynn</b><br> Daily Express, September 17 </p> <p>\"Most Labour MPs are primarily motivated by class hatred, rejoicing in their ability to put one over the 'toffs'. What a piece of empty symbolism... </p> <p>\"Whether the hunt protests come to be seen as Mr Blair's equivalent of the poll tax riots remains for history to judge. But the nation clearly needs a new beginning that can only take place without him. Remember Tony: seven years and then they hate you.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Mail </b><br> Editorial, September 17  </p> <p>\"Protesters are intent on turning this into as explosive an issue as the poll tax, with a relentless series of demonstrations. Mr Blair will hardly be able to set foot in the countryside without running into a protest. He will be dogged in the Commons, hounded at Labour's conference. This is a sadly predictable response from the huge majority of largely decent people who have been turned into outcasts and seen a way of life treated with contempt. </p> <p>\"That said, the Mail urges them to have a care. Wednesday was an ugly day for democracy. They mustn't allow frustration to boil over into illegality or violence. In the battle for hearts and minds, they have to keep the moral high ground. Anything less plays into the hands of a prime minister who cares only for himself.\" </p> <p><b> Independent</b><br> Editorial, September 17 </p> <p>\"Rightwing newspapers, usually so quick to condemn protests that get out of hand, have been muted in their condemnation of the perpetrators of the mayhem. Tory MPs, usually so critical of direct action and violent protests, seemed almost supportive of such antics. Perhaps it was because the protesters wore check shirts and tweed suits rather than T-shirts and dreadlocks. Or perhaps it is just breathtaking hypocrisy. </p> <p>\"This newspaper does not support the proposed ban on hunting, an illiberal measure and a diversion from more important issues. But the facts are simple. An elected government is forcing through a measure that was in its manifesto and is supported by a majority in the country. Consequently, where is the difference between the hooliganism of some poll-tax protesters and the hooliganism of some in the hunting lobby? ... The hypocrites in the media and politics should recognise this, and think a little harder about the values they are suddenly espousing.\"</p> <p><b> Ros Wynne-Jones</b><br> Daily Mirror, September 17 </p> <p>\"Make no mistake, what those who were protesting on Tuesday really hate is the Labour government ... These are ... the same privileged toffs who hate everything that Labour stands for on equality of opportunity, on redistribution of wealth. These are Thatcher's Farmers - the last bastion of Tory arrogance and intolerance, who believe that wealth and privilege is a birthright. </p> <p>\"In truth, the foxhunting debate is just a smokescreen for an agenda aimed at overthrowing the government through violent protest and a series of disturbances ... These Tory extremists are desperate for the issue to be the Labour Party's poll tax, yet the contrast shows just how pathetic their protest is. In 1990, protesters took to the streets to fight against a Tory tax that burdened Britain's poorest people to the point of penury. In 2004, Tories take to the streets to fight a Labour government for the right to rip apart foxes.\"</p> <p><b> Simon Jenkins</b><br> Times, September 17 </p> <p>\"This is no trivial reform. I believe the hunting vote marks a historic transfer of the spirit of rural Britain from country to town ... On hunting, the libertarians have lost. Rural Britain is being refashioned on urban terms ...</p> <p>\"The survival of what most decent people must surely regard as uniquely precious - the rural landscape - now depends crucially on a new alliance. It is between that landscape's only plausible custodians, farmers, on the one hand and its new political masters, the mass of urban country-lovers on the other. It is a coalition of many people despised by farmers in the past and people who may have now deprived them of their favourite sport: ramblers, tour operators, nature conservationists, bird- watchers, weekenders and hobby farmers...</p> <p>\"They must stand together or lose what both proclaim to treasure. On Wednesday the country lobby went to Westminster and met its Waterloo. It must now pay homage to a new master. For its own survival it must learn to love its enemy.\"</p>",
  "Robin Cook yesterday placed himself at the head of a cross-party coalition of MPs determined to prevent either government or parliament overreacting in their response to the foxhunters' invasion of the Commons. <p>In a series of media interventions in the wake of Wednesday's drama the former leader of the Commons, who is both pro-hunting and a reformer of parliamentary procedure, stressed: \"Otis Ferry [one of the protesters] is not Osama bin Laden.\" </p> <p>Peter Hain, his successor as Commons leader, and other senior ministers are determined to use the opportunity to wrest control of key security issues from what they regard as a stubbornly conservative parliamentary administration led by the Speaker, Michael Martin. </p> <p>Mr Martin's advisers have decided not to add to this week's hysteria by making any comment. But Mr Cook's perspective also commands support in all parties, not least among Tory MPs who see the issue as a battle between an over-mighty executive - represented by the impatient Mr Hain - and the legislature which must retain control of its own affairs, including its self-policing. </p> <p>Seeking to inject some perspective into this week's hysteria Mr Cook told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"It is not the first time we have seen people get into the chamber of the House of Commons. There was another occasion when the IRA actually blew up a number of our offices. We do then get panicked into turning the Commons into a fortress.\" </p> <p>David Blunkett, the home secretary, shares Mr Hain's impatience with perceived obstruction by Tory MPs, Commons officials and the Speaker. They are deemed to have failed to move fast enough to tighten controls inside the ancient Palace of Westminster where 14,000 people hold passes of one kind or another, from hereditary peers to cleaners. </p> <p>The external perimeter of the palace is tightly guarded by the Metropolitan police who share New Labour's enthusiasm to gain control of the inner sanctums in the age of the suicide bomber. </p> <p>As a stunt by the Sun demonstrated yesterday, it is relatively easy to get a pass to work as a cook or electrician, though the checks are - ironically - made by the police or outside contractors. Mr Hain, who took part himself in direct action in his youth when he disrupted South African sports fixtures, expressed gratitude that the Sun \"did us a favour\". </p> <p>For more than a year MI5 has been advising the Commons authorities to improve security arrangements in the face of a threat of a terrorist attack. </p> <p>In a proposal backed by Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, MI5 proposed that a single director of security should be appointed for the whole Palace of Westminster, replacing the antiquated system under which the Serjeant at Arms and Black Rod are responsible for security. Both officials helped reject the plan last week, to the fury of security chiefs who are ready to try again. In the wake of the \"Tory toff\" invasion this week they are likely to succeed. </p> <p>MI5 has long warned that the threat from al-Qaida sympatheisers against such an \"iconic\" target is high. Even the concrete blocks set up around Westminster could become lethal projectiles in the event of an attack by suicide bombers. </p> <p>But Mr Cook and senior Tory backbenchers such as Derek Conway warn against the futility of such tactics. \"If you surround the Commons with more concrete blocks, more razor wire, even more armed guards, you are going to create a symbol that parliament is even more remote, even more impenetrable at the very time we need to focus on re-connecting with the public, not getting further away from them,\" Mr Cook said yesterday. </p> <p>Ironically his own reform that introduced a two-week September session contributed to the building site chaos that allowed the Old Etonian squad to pull off their stunt. Trying to squeeze summer repairs to the Gothic palace into six weeks has added \u00a31m to this summer's \u00a311.5m bill. Security officials have advised that a steel barrier would be safer and more effective, and have warned about the vulnerability of Big Ben to attack. </p> <p>MI5 has apparently concluded that a Commons pass should not be treated like club membership, and that intrusive searches should become routine. But their suggestion that long-serving passholders be regularly vetted as well as searched like anyone else visiting the buildings produces a hollow laugh among MPs and officials as typical of the overreaction encouraged by ministers and hysterical sections of the press.</p>",
  "Shops and bars which sell alcohol to children will suffer much tougher penalties after a series of \"sting operations\" this summer revealed that it was a common practice in more than 650 English and Welsh licensed premises. <p>Pubs, clubs and supermarkets involved in more than one incident are to get letters from David Blunkett, the home secretary, demanding to know what action they are taking. </p> <p>New licensing legislation will be introduced next month which will increase the \u00a31,000 current maximum fine for under-age sales to \u00a35,000. </p> <p>During the eight-week \"summer blitz\" on under-age and binge drinking, more than 1,700 sting operations established that 51% of the pubs and clubs and 32% of the off-licences were selling alcohol to under-18s. </p> <p>During the campaign 5,764 people were arrested for alcohol-related offences, and a further 4,060 were given on-the-spot fines, mainly for harassment and being drunk and disorderly. The police confiscated alcohol from 3,311 under-18s and 6,385 adults drinking in a \"designated public area\". </p> <p>Mr Blunkett said that from November the police would be able to hand on-the-spot fines to those involved in buying or selling alcohol to children . </p> <p>He said there was no point in the drinks industry adopting policies to deal with sale of drink to children if they were not implemented. </p> <p>\"That is why I will be writing to chief executives of the off-licenses and drinking establishments that have repeatedly sold alcohol illegally to find out what positive action will be taken.\" </p> <p>Ron Gainsford of the Trading Standards Institute warned shops which were repeatedly breaking the law that the gloves were now off. </p> <p>Alcohol Concern called for prosecutions and the naming and shaming of businesses which broke the law. The British Beer and Pub Association said the results showed that a small minority was tarnishing the industry's image.</p>"
