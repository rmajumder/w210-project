[
  "<p>FOR A WOMAN who had got off the red-eye from New York just a few hours earlier, Pamela Thomas-Graham seemed surprisingly bubbly and energetic when I met her recently. </p> <p>The 40-year-old chief executive of CNBC was in London for just a day - welcoming her new European chief, Mick Buckley - before heading off to inspect another part of her global business TV empire. She showed no sign of jetlag or airport fatigue. But then I remembered reading that she was one of those infuriating people, like Napoleon and Baroness Thatcher, who could exist, indeed thrive, on just a few hours sleep a night. </p> <p>That ability must be one of the reasons for the achievements she has chalked up in her remarkable professional career. She is one of the few black women at the helm of a US corporation, as she was the first to break into the almost exclusively male preserve of partnership at the waspish management consultant, McKinsey. She is about to start work on her latest novel, the fourth in a series of mystery tales involving a black female economics professor at an Ivy League college (Thomas-Graham went to Harvard); and she is the mother of three children, including twins just approaching their second birthday. </p> <p>It makes me tired just thinking about it, but she takes it all in her stride. Her day begins at 4am, with a couple of hours' writing before the children wake up. 'I always read lots when I was a child, and when I went to Harvard Law School I wanted to exercise the creative side of my mind. Mysteries are such a fun genre,' she explains. </p> <p>She has some 'quality time' with the children before heading to her office, and is sometimes home to put them to bed. Other responsibilities - she is on the board of the New York Opera and the American Red Cross - can make it a very long day. </p> <p>The heroine of the novels, Nikki Chase, is 'smart and sassy and sexy', according to the blurb of the latest, Orange Crushed . She too puts in the hours, ruffles feathers and upsets reputations in her quest for the truth about a murdered Princeton academic. It is no surprise to find that Thomas-Graham admits to a touch of autobiographical inspiration for her character. </p> <p>'Sure, she deals with lots of the challenges I've also faced. In the USA in the 1990s, you didn't find women or coloured people in senior management roles. They faced a set of issues which were quite unique, in that most people in business simply did not know women of colour. As you began to advance in your career, it made you very visible, and got you noticed at work. That was good if you were getting noticed for positive things, but if you made mistakes they got extrapolated onto the rest of the minority.' </p> <p>From respectable middle-class origins in Detroit, she was made chief executive of CNBC in the summer of 2001, just a few weeks before the 11 September terrorist attacks that changed everything for America. 'The first six months were like The Perfect Storm ', she remembers. 'The financial markets were in recession after the internet bubble, then came the corporate scandals like Enron and WorldCom. And 9/11 on top of all that. Overnight, we went from being a peacetime to a wartime economy.' </p> <p>This presented unique problems for CNBC. The channel, with its running ticker-tape of Wall Street share prices, market updates and talking heads assuming 'buy' or 'sell' positions, was a score board for the financial community. Its interviews with business leaders had the air of a papal audience, where the anchor and the audience were content just to listen to the great man's words. That changed. 'Suddenly, the business leaders became con artists in many people's eyes,' says Graham. 'What do you do then?' </p> <p>The answer was to go 'broader and deeper', she says. 'From being a stock-market channel we became a business news channel, and that was a big difference. We had to become multi-dimensional, with a greater focus on the economy, on Washington, on security and foreign affairs. We realised that how safe people feel at home was probably the most important factor in how they invest. And we had to become more sceptical and probing.' </p> <p>The channel had to expand its global coverage. This was partly a response to the greater importance of international events and how they impacted on US business, but it was also a sound commercial strategy. 'We have access to 200 million households around the world, and we'd never fully leveraged that.' </p> <p>It was a business opportunity just waiting to be exploited. </p> <p>According to the market surveys, CNBC viewers are 'high net worth individuals', with average assets of $1m each. Some 90 per cent have degrees, and they are intelligent, sophisticated and discriminating. 'Our audience will hang on in there and won't feel the need to have things dumbed down for them,' she says. She calls the channel the business network of record, and compares it to the Wall Street Journal in reliability and depth of its coverage. The link to the Journal goes further than that - Dow Jones is a CNBC partner, via the ultimate holding company, the giant General Electric Corporation. </p> <p>Other media organisations have learnt that foreign news networks are expensive and management intensive, but CNBC's business model is different, says Graham. Broadcasts from outside the US are centred on the great financial capitals of the world - London, Frankfurt, Dubai, Hong Kong and Tokyo - where business news can be presented in a direct way. </p> <p>This allows CNBC to fund more 'in-depth' analysis of national and regional economies, and industrial and financial sectors, in special reports and set-pieces from, for example, the Davos summit or Paris airshow. </p> <p>The channel's financial performance is not stripped out from its parent NBC Universal, but, with premium advertising rates for its top-notch audience, she says it is 'highly profitable. GE is a very demanding parent.' </p> <p>After her whistlestop tour of CNBC's global network, she is back in the States (homes in Manhattan and Westchester) to supervise coverage of the presidential election. 'There are two issues: Iraq and the economy. Obviously we will focus on the economy, and we have to answer the question of how the CEOs vote.' </p> <p>If this is a sign that she's going to tell me whether she is for George Bush or John Kerry, she never follows through, and we become diverted to another subject before I get the chance to ask. So I don't know how Pamela Thomas-Graham is going to vote in this election. </p> <p>Her background and east coast lifestyle say Democrat, her position as a self-made business leader says Republican. Take your pick. </p> <p>But for what it's worth, I reckon Nikki Chase would definitely be for Kerry. </p> <p><strong>Thoughts of Nikki Chase:</strong></p> <p><strong> ON RACE</strong> </p> <p>'Now we were both successful black women at Harvard. We should have been close friends and allies - but apparently Janice felt the place was too small for the two of us. And she would be thrilled to see me gone. It was sad, but true: the old school HNIC phenomenon (that would be Head Nigger In Charge) was very much alive and well in our generation.' </p> <p><strong> ON MEN</strong> </p> <p>'One of the well-established perks of an academic conference is the opportunity to flirt shamelessly. But after the autumn I'd just had, flirting with handsome dark-eyed men fell into the high-risk category' </p> <p><strong> ON CAREERS</strong> </p> <p>'In another life, Gwen might have been one of those smart, wise-cracking secretaries in a 1930s screwball comedy. Now it was a different century, and she was going to night school to get a degree in education'</p>",
  "<p>Some people have asked me why there has been more politics than economics in this column recently. The answer is that this column has always been about politics and economics - 'political economy' - and in recent months, the politics has been far more interesting than the economics. </p> <p>But this does not mean that Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has succeeded in his aim of making the work of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) so boring that nobody pays any attention to it. Indeed, the governor can hardly open his mouth without being quoted on the front pages and the airwaves. </p> <p>There have been two interesting speeches on the economy in the past fortnight, one by the governor, and one by Sir Alan Budd. There have also been some interesting statistics, surveys and corporate statements suggesting that the pace of growth in the economy is slowing down. </p> <p>First to Budd, who was chief economic adviser to the Treasury during the chancellorships of Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke. His period in this role, 1991-97, included the more torrid phase of our membership of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), though when we entered it he was still in the private sector. </p> <p>He argued in the 2004 Wincott Foundation Lecture that the 'final objective' of ERM membership was to control inflation, after all other devices, including the monetarist approach he once advocated, had failed. Or, as he gently put it: 'I hope I can say without offending anyone that the experiment in seeking to control inflation by setting quantitative monetary targets did not match the hopes of its most enthusiastic supporters [among whom I am willing to count myself].' Professor Milton Friedman made a similar confession just over a year ago. </p> <p>Leave aside any thoughts that joining the ERM was about wanting to be more 'European'. For Budd, and many in the Treasury, the ERM was the counter-inflation policy of last resort. </p> <p>In a somewhat revisionist view of history, Budd argues that the ERM episode was, in this respect, a resounding success. 'I believe we joined at the right time and left at the right time, but that was a matter of luck rather than skill.' </p> <p>His thesis is that, having failed to devise a successful monetary policy before, 'somehow, when we left the ERM, we discovered how to do it'. Disarmingly, he recalls a 'particularly painful' City lunch in the (financially) hot summer of 1992 when he remarked that, if Britain were to leave the ERM, 'our credibility would be completely destroyed'. His host replied: 'That depends on what replaces it'. </p> <p>I recall a lunch around that time when I asked a certain Treasury official why they had (at the time) made it a policy of 'double' rather than 'quits' (the quits came on Black Wednesday, 16 September that year). His reply was: 'The Treasury has lost one Chancellor [reference to Nigel Lawson's dramatic resignation in 1989]. We cannot afford to lose another.' </p> <p>Well, as Budd points out, what replaced ERM membership was the system of inflation targets and monthly meetings of the Chancellor and governor (which became known as 'the Ken and Eddie Show'), publication of the Bank of England Inflation Reports and, hey presto, the deus ex machina of Gordon Brown and his granting of operational independence to the Bank of England in 1997. </p> <p>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc? (After this, therefore on account of this?) I wonder. Budd may proclaim 'it is universally acknowledged that the current framework for monetary policy in the UK is as close to perfection as fallible men can hope to achieve', but the fact of the matter is that all this coincided with a remarkably disinflationary climate around the world. And, of course, Brown and Ed Balls would argue that it was only after 1997 that inflationary expectations in the UK were really brought down. </p> <p>Budd's thesis is superficially appealing, but does not seem to this observer to justify the extraordinary pain inflicted on the British economy by the ERM episode - from which many businesses and individuals may never have fully recovered. </p> <p>Which brings us to Mervyn King, and his speech last week at the Eden Project in Cornwall. Is the victory Budd has declared over inflation a permanent one? The governor is not so sure. </p> <p>'Eden' is the reference point of the month. In his lecture, Budd half-joked that 'My usual preference, when talking about economic issues, is to start with the garden of Eden and work slowly forward, leaving the events in question to be discussed in a great rush in the closing minutes of the lecture.' </p> <p>I know the feeling. King, speaking on the site of the environmental exhibition at the Eden Project where, among other things, there is a tropical area, decided to hot things up. 'After all,' said the governor. 'Starting from the garden of Eden, there can only be a fall from grace.' </p> <p>The Chancellor must occasionally wonder about the day he made the Bank independent, and the second day (not the next day) on which he appointed King as governor. It was King who said on 14 June on the Chancellor's own territory (Scotland): 'It is clear that the chances of falls in house prices are greater than they were.' </p> <p>His remarks, producing headlines such as 'Governor warns of house price crash', had a huge impact. Indeed, some advanced economic historians already date the turn in the housing market to that speech. The Treasury was furious. 'The Bank is so amateurish in these matters', said the spinners. But the Bank was not amateurish at all. Indeed, internal Bank betting was pretty accurate at forecasting the following day's headlines. They wanted to make that kind of impact. </p> <p>So, here we go, onwards to the Eden Project, or backwards to the garden of Eden. King first reminds us that, about a year ago, he had described the period since the 1980s as a Non-inflationary Consistently Expansionary - or 'Nice decade - in which economic growth was above trend, unemployment fell steadily and inflation remained 'low and stable'. </p> <p>But, he asks, will it last? What he did not go on to say is: Do you want political spin, well-timed for the next General Election, or do you want the views of a serious, analytical, and hawkish governor of the Bank of England? 'What is clear,' he then said, 'is that the combination of low and stable inflation and continuously falling unemployment must come to an end at some point.' In case you are not fully awake, the sting in the tail was 'and may already have done so'. </p> <p>Mindful of the lessons of history and the burgeoning crisis caused by a $50-plus price of oil per barrel, King warned about future fluctuations 'in growth and unemployment, as well as inflation'. </p> <p>According to King, the Nice decade will be followed by the Not So Bad Decade. We shall see. This government has succeeded beyond its expectations in avoiding financial crises. It is not in the garden of Eden from the economic point of view, but it has a Prime Minister who has been as rash as Anthony Eden was over Suez. Despite the abysmal condition of the Tory Party and Michael Howard's position over the war, I still believe Britain intends to punish Blair for the biggest foreign policy misjudgment since Suez. </p> <p>Even George W Bush is on record, with regard to the countries that opposed the war, as saying: 'I know how these people think. I meet with them all the time ... They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake.' </p> <p>Those who do, economic success or no, must be the Fall guys.</p>",
  "<p>SOMETIMES serious law is made quietly, away from the well-publicised arena of the courts. Tomorrow, new laws shackling the media come into force. They have attracted little attention, but their purpose is simple: for the first time the courts will be able to compel someone not involved in a criminal trial to pay all or part of its costs, which could run to millions of pounds. </p> <p>Previously, only the parties to a case or their lawyers could be hit. The changes, which come into force via an amendment to the Courts Act 2003, will have serious implications for news organisations reporting criminal proceedings and could place real constraints on press freedom. </p> <p>How and why has this come about? The legislation was inspired by the collapse of the Woodgate and Bowyer prosecution (cost: \u00a31 million) in which a retrial was ordered as a result of an article in the Sunday Mirror . </p> <p>The editor of the newspaper, Colin Myler, resigned. It did not stop there: the publisher was fined \u00a375,000 and ordered to pay \u00a3100,000 in legal costs. </p> <p>The weapon used against the media in the Leeds footballers' case was contempt of court. The Attorney-General prosecutes for contempt if he considers a report has caused a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the course of justice. The law of contempt is taken very seriously by journalists and publishers and the consequences of breaking it are grave, extending not just to huge fines and costs but also to imprisonment. </p> <p>The law has to be tough because it protects a serious matter: the conduct of criminal trials on which individual freedom and justice depend. But while the law of contempt is a tough one at least its meaning is clear. The same cannot be said of the new regulations or their consequences. </p> <p>While prosecutions for contempt can only be brought by the Attorney-General, there is no independent safeguard under the new regulations. A trial judge will be free to order a third party, such as a news organisation, to pay the entire cost of a collapsed trial if he thinks there has been serious misconduct. Contempt of court is now irrelevant, unless you want to send an editor to prison. </p> <p>Consider what might have happened to the Sunday Mirror under the new regime. Forget boring old contempt and the Attorney-General: the trial judge could have found serious misconduct (whatever that is) and ordered the entire costs of the first trial to be paid by the newspaper. </p> <p>The newspaper would, of course, have had an opportunity to be heard, as the regulations say the court must allow a third party to make representations, and it would also have had a right of appeal, although the chances of a successful appeal would have been slim. The position would be even worse for a story that amounted to misconduct but was not in contempt: no liability under the old law; a fine of millions under the new. </p> <p>Does this matter? Is it disproportionate for greater penalties to be imposed for misconduct than for contempt of court? If you care about the open reporting of criminal trials and restrictions on the media, the answer must be 'yes'. </p> <p>The effect of the new regulations will not be to prevent miscarriages of justice (the evil guarded against by proceedings for contempt of court) but to limit court reporting. </p> <p>This point was picked up when the regulations were debated in parliament. The Newspaper Society and the Fleet Street Lawyers wanted the Attorney-General's consent for any proceedings. No doubt both bodies had in mind the frequency with which the lower courts wrongly restrict the reporting of criminal trials. Their concerns were rejected with the argument that it would not be necessary, or helpful, to drag the Attorney-General into the dull and thorny area of costs - he should be saved for more serious matters such as contempt and prison. </p> <p>This is a sly and disingenuous argument. Costs' sanctions bite hard. Where costs' penalties may run into millions, freedom of expression begins to look expensive not only to a publisher but also to its insurers. The chilling effect of million-pound penalties is obvious. </p> <p>There are special dangers here, not least because the consequences of the regulations have hardly been discussed. In a press release accompanying the announcement of changes to the law, the government gave examples of trials that have collapsed 'due to serious misconduct by a third party'. The first was prejudicial media reporting; the other two were misbehaviour by a juror and intimidation of a jury, acts of extreme recklessness and criminal intent. </p> <p>All media organisations are careful to avoid contempt of court: the Sunday Mirror story was a hideous mistake. Is it right to bracket inaccurate media coverage with jury nobbling and to impose the same punishment for a mistake as for a deliberate or reckless attempt to pervert the course of justice? The taint by association is clear and harmful. </p> <p>Historically the courts have recognised the principles of open justice and accepted that accurate reporting of criminal trials is important for society at large. During the last few years there has been a shift away from that starting point, mainly because of the stifling effect of anti-terrorism legislation on traditional liberties, whether in terms of trial process or open justice. The costs' regulations are another manifestation of this illiberal change. They should remind us that self-censorship imposed through financial fear can be more severe than direct government control. </p> <p><strong>Martin Soames is a media litigation partner at DLA </strong></p>",

  "<p>Michael has cerebral palsy with moderate disabilities due to medical negligence at birth. He writes: </p> <p>'My mobility is restricted, my eyesight is impaired and I am clumsy. Five years ago, I was awarded \u00a3450,000 in medical damages. This has been held in trust by the Court Funds Office until this month when I reach 18 and it becomes my responsibility. </p> <p>I live a relatively normal and independent life for my age. I intend to go to university next year to study politics and something else. </p> <p>University will cost me more than most students because I have to use taxis and buy suitable computer equipment. When I leave home, I will have to pay for help with food, laundry, cleaning and domestic maintenance. Holidays and insurance are more expensive for me. </p> <p>I expect I will have a career but perhaps a part-time rather than full-time job. I should be able to live an independent life, using money from the award to cover extra costs for transport, home help and home adaptations. </p> <p>When I start work, it's quite likely that I will to want to buy a property. </p> <p>In 1999, the award was put into a high-interest savings account. In 2001, the Court Funds Office strongly advised that half be invested in shares. This was worth about \u00a3250,000 at the time but is now worth about \u00a3165,000. The rest of my money remained in the cash account and now comes to \u00a3305,000. </p> <p>I will need some annual income to support my education and enhance my lifestyle but the priority, while I am studying, should be to improve the capital value of my investments. </p> <p>That said, I need to make substantial provision for my later life as my disabilities are likely to affect me more then and may be complicated by other health problems. So a substantial portion of the award should be invested now to provide me with financial security later. </p> <p>My most immediate question is what to do about my current portfolio of investments. Should some or all be sold, or retained in the expectation that their performance eventually proves worthwhile? </p> <p>The other question is what to do with the \u00a3300,000 in cash. I think that much of this should also be invested but I do not want to repeat the mistake of three years ago. Also, as I will now become liable for tax, perhaps I should have an offshore bank account.' <br><strong>Michael</strong></p> <p><strong>Buy a property without delay</strong><br> You face critical investment decisions and, although we give some suggestions here, you must talk it through with an experienced financial adviser. </p> <p>First decide how much to keep in cash and how much to invest for the longer term. Anna Bowes, investments manager at Chase de Vere, calculates: 'Michael could earn \u00a318,800 a year before tax if he invested the whole \u00a3470,000 for income, with a little capital growth, at 4 per cent.' </p> <p>That is probably more income than you will need at university, so scale down the proportion providing income and invest the rest entirely for capital growth. </p> <p>Michael Brill, a director at Baronworth, suggests you save \u00a320,000 in an ING Direct deposit account at 5 per cent with instant access. </p> <p>He then recommends putting \u00a350,000 into a Nationwide offshore account: 'The interest is taxable but compounds gross.' Other advisers are less keen on going offshore. Matt Pitcher of Towry Law and Bowes reckons an offshore bank account might be too complicated, because you would have to submit a tax return. </p> <p>With your equity investments, Brill believes: 'It's not a bad idea to cut his losses on the existing investments and go into something safer.' He suggests putting \u00a3200,000 into a guaranteed growth bond or guaranteed income bond paying 4.7 per cent net, worth 5.88 per cent to a basic-rate taxpayer, for three years with no risk. Or a distribution bond such as Axa Sun Life or Legal and General's where half is invested in gilts, fixed interest and cash and you can take 5 per cent income a year without tax: 'He could cash it in if he buys a property in five or six years' time.' </p> <p>Pitcher recommends keeping the existing investments in the hope that they recover: 'The investments made in 2001 seem to consist of investment trusts and unit trusts almost exclusively investing in the stock market, with little exposure to other assets such as fixed-interest securities and property.' </p> <p>Bowes comments: 'It's understandable to feel nervous about investing in anything other than cash after his experience, but three years really is a short investment timescale. I suggest spreading the money 50 per cent in shares, 25 per cent in fixed interest and 25 per cent in property. The shares should be mainly UK-based, in equity income funds, but some global exposure is important. Fixed interest will provide the bulk of the income and will also diversify the risk.' </p> <p>Pitcher suggests a fund supermarket such as Co-funds to consolidate your unit trust portfolio in one place: 'Many of his existing unit trusts can be transferred at no cost. I suggest Michael uses Cofunds to maximise his Isa allowance of \u00a37,000 a year as well. He should then look for a balanced portfolio that includes gilts, corporate bonds and commercial property as well as shares for his new investments.' </p> <p>Mark Quilter is a divisional director at Gerrard and for the last 16 years has invested money for people under the Mental Health Act and who are recipients of personal injury and damages awards: 'I suggest Michael uses at least half the large cash balance to buy a property as he will definitely need a property to live in. With the likelihood of property prices continuing to rise over the longer term, any delay could prove to be a mistake. Holding a property will also diversify Michael's portfolio.' </p> <p>Bowes points out that working part-time could result in a smaller pension so suggests starting a stakeholder pension now: '... although this is not such a good idea if his life expectancy is shorter than normal as it will tie up money that he may never benefit from.' You could take money from your deposit account to pay premiums of \u00a32,808 a year which the Inland Revenue tops up to \u00a33,600. </p> <p>Finally Bowes advises: 'Michael should put the bulk of the money into a trust immediately and arrange for a power of attorney in case, later on, he suffers mental incapacity. With the settlement, he would lose any means-tested state benefits he might receive but settling the money into trust shelters it from means-testing.' </p> <p><strong>Michael's to-do list</strong> <br>1. See a financial adviser before making any investment decisions. </p> <p>2. Consider putting the award in trust. </p> <p>3. Keep enough to pay for university and buy a property. </p> <p>4.

It was a self-consciously writerly sort of a rant, spoken softly but simmering with barely suppressed fury: </p> <p>'Battersea Park, Sunday,' said Bob, quietly, 'every second measured and weighed in the balance of loss, losing. Going away and fading. Everything must be crammed into this space. Life in an hour. Love in a measured fragment of state-permitted time. Feed the ducks again. McDad in McDonald's. Where else do you go?' </p> <p>But he couldn't suppress the rage for long and, over the course of the next hour, spewed a thesaurus's-worth. Here's some of it: </p> <p>'Criminalised. Belittled ... Worthless. Powerless. Irrelevant ... Biased. Prejudiced. Discriminatory. Hypocritical. Inflammatory ... Discord. Bitterness ... Rage ... Anger. Hatred. Reactionary. Unfair. Illogical. Destructive. Failed. Decrepit ... Prejudiced. Belittled. Impoverished. Embittered. Corrosive. Disgraceful ... Impertinent. Insane. Outdated ... Defunct. Fractured. Scarred, Disgusting, Disgraceful. ... Distraught. Ruinous ... Vulgar. Perverse, Vile, Frightening. Emasculated. Eviscerated ... Plagued. Manipulated ... Farcical. Outdated. Inadequate'. And, several times, 'Unjust. Unjust. Unjust. Unjust .' </p> <p>We watched Geldof reading from notes to camera, Geldof interviewing solicitors and law lords, ministers and professors and, of course, empathising with fathers who had lost custody of their children as a result of what he hyperbolically described as 'state-sponsored child abuse'. Some of this, admittedly, was very moving, particularly if you took the stories at face value. </p> <p>'Do you have anxiety before he comes, or is it just longing? Or is it a mixture?' Geldof asked Jim Parton of the pressure group Families Need Fathers, in relation to Parton's occasional visits from a son who now lives with his mother in Japan. Parton, previously articulate and stiff-of-lip, stalled and stammered before breaking down in tears, at which point Geldof leaned over and held his hand. </p> <p>But I wasn't moved for long because we weren't told the circumstances of the break-up of Parton's marriage, or details of his cus tody battle - if indeed there had been one (Parton seemed to imply that, daunted by the legal process, he'd just given up and let events take their course - which would, of course, have been unlikely to result in his winning custody). </p> <p>As Geldof pitched his argument more along the lines of a battle of the sexes than as any sort of justifiable fight against the clearly inadequate unsubtleties of the law, it was, I suspect, virtually impossible for any woman to watch this and not emerge feeling almost as enraged by the issues raised as Geldof, albeit for entirely different reasons. </p> <p>'If the child is already living with the mum ... the courts may well decide that it is in the child's best interest to continue,' said Margaret Hodge, gently but firmly. </p> <p>'But that's wrong !' shouted Geldof. </p> <p>But a lot of the time it probably isn't wrong. One of the few facts buried in the film was that more women apply for residency orders and more men for contact orders, ergo the majority of divorcing men do not actually want sole or even equal custody of their children but are happy enough to negotiate visitation rights, for whatever reasons. </p> <p>I am all for making the personal political but there was a painful self-righteousness and divisiveness at the heart of this film, which was haunted by the silent blond spectre at the centre of Geldof's own marital breakdown. And by the time we'd negotiated the amateurish camerawork and arrived at the rants about lonely and impoverished fathers barely existing in bedsits, the injustice of men being perceived as 'not trustworthy as humans - we're hairy and brutish with uncontrollable man-urges', I had given up the possibility of hearing anything that wasn't informed by Geldof's undeniably painful but almost entirely unique emotional journey. </p> <p>In the end Geldof suggested a 50-50 parental custody split, wherever possible, as a legal starting point to neutralise any subsequent negotiating position. Theoretically fair enough, yet a 50-50 split - or even 60-40 or 70-30 - is almost entirely impractical in real life. Only ex-couples with considerable funds are going to be able to create two family-sized homes close enough to each other to make for minimum disruption, and, if both parties work, to pay for two sets of complementary childcare. </p> <p>And, of course, this kind of split-arrangement is potentially disastrous for children, who loathe being shunted around from parent to parent at set times simply because those parents believe it is the 'right' thing to do. That this perceived 'rightness' should be enshrined in law would, as Margaret Hodge correctly pointed out, inevitably 'produce more conflict, more litigation'. </p> <p> Geldof on Fathers was a companion piece to the previous night's <strong> Geldof on Marriage</strong>. Here the central argument was that we treat marriage too lightly, that the 'moral value of promise has disintegrated' in a consumer culture of instant gratification in which we're busy indulging an overblown sense of self ('Because I'm worth it'). That, in short, we have confused freedom with the idea of choice. </p> <p>I don't actually disagree with this, but I did disagree very strongly with Geldof's contention that divorce has been made too easy. Far from it: divorce is plenty hard enough - it is marriage that has been made too easy. </p> <p>In Geldof's case it was clearly easy for him to indulge himself in making films that, ultimately, revealed nothing more than the scale of his self-righteous rage. But I don't doubt that anger can be channelled very cathartically if one happens to be the co-founder and non-executive director of a company that produces documentaries. </p> <p>On the subject of imbalance, however, perhaps I ought not to have given over quite so much space to Geldof when last week also saw the start of <strong> Sex Traffic</strong>, which, rather ironically, is almost everything one would look for in a contemporary drama - informed and informative, thrillingly entertaining and tackling a hugely difficult subject without ever resorting to shock tactics or exploitation - the opposite of Geldof's uneasy, self-dramatising efforts. </p> <p> Sex Traffic , written by the gifted Abi Morgan, is ostensibly the story of two Moldovan sisters who, believing they are headed to a better life in the west, are sold into prostitution by untrustworthy, brutish men with deeply nasty, uncontrollable man-urges. </p> <p>It is a powerful, compulsive, unputdownable television journey (I watched both parts in one sitting, occasionally emerging for a gulp of fresh air) and by the end I felt richer for it. Many feature films aspire to create a similarly riveting strength of narrative, but I can't remember when I last saw a cinema release as powerful and intelligently realised as this British and Canadian co- production. Indeed, I wouldn't be surprised if it was remade in Hollywood. </p> <p>There is sex in Sex Traffic , but it's not the kind you want to watch. There is nudity but no titillation, which is an enormously difficult balance to achieve (the direction is stunningly good and the actors respond in kind). There is a multi-layered plot, too, involving the corrupting influence of a US government-sanctioned private security firm acting under the auspices of the International Peacekeeping Coalition, not to mention love and war and betrayal, shopping and fucking and shocking fucking, glamour and grime, and - praise be - the never less than fabulous John Simm. </p> <p>Indeed one of the few implausible aspects of the story centres on the fact that Simm, as a charity worker investigating the human traffic from eastern Europe, doesn't enlist a campaigning journalist to help his cause, but this is probably because the best person for that job is Cal MacCaffrey, aka John Simm, star reporter on State of Play 's mighty organ, the Daily Nighy . Whatever: I cannot recommend Sex Traffic highly enough - if you missed part one, set the video for C4, 11.10 tonight. It concludes on Thursday. </p> <p>I watched <strong> Trial and Retribution</strong> by Lynda La Plante after I'd seen Sex Traffic , so inevitably it suffers by comparison. From the opening shots of the body of a beautiful woman - a prostitute - falling in slo-mo from the balcony of an apartment and landing on the bonnet of a car (shot-for-shot an identical death to that suffered by Claire Goose in Waking The Dead ) we were treated, if that's the right word, to a glossy, populist prime-time vision of prostitution and sexual perversion, the sort that revels in close-ups of the bodies of brutalised women. </p> <p>Dead they may be but, hey, in the world of Trial and Retribution the women invariably enjoyed their job when they were alive - may, in fact, have died because they enjoyed it so very much. Sleazy, tasteless, crude and failing to tell a cohesive or even plausible story over its three hours, the fact that this morally bankrupt piece of television was skilfully directed and executed professionally enough to make it intensely watchable means there will presumably be a great deal more of the same. Profoundly depressing.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The best thing about being middle-aged? </strong>Nothing. You have wisdom that you can't impart, you have knowledge that is meaningless and your body withers away and becomes disgusting. Now, I look in the mirror and go, 'Whhhaaaat?! That's not...

She was wearing a peasant blouse and she had beautiful breasts. I was so happy. At a certain point she left the set and came back wearing a turtleneck. It was a life-changing moment.

  "<p><strong>Othello</strong><br>World Service</p> <p><strong>The Real Slobodan Milosevic</strong><br>Five Live</p> <p><strong>The Story Of African Oil</strong><br>World Service</p> <p>One reason that I have always preferred radio to television is that you can tell so much more from a person's voice than from their appearance. Voices are difficult to disguise though it is probably easier for a goodie to make themselves sound like a baddie than for a villain to pretend he is a lamb. Having said that, Art Malik playing Iago in the World Service's brilliant new production of <strong> Othello</strong> managed to pull a great deal of lamb's wool over his paranoid general's eyes with a wonderfully subtle performance that had me clenching my fists in frustration whenever Othello fell for his honeyed treachery. It was a good idea to split the play into two episodes, the first ending when Othello demands positive proof from Iago that Desdemona has betrayed him - and of course Iago has the proof in the shape of her handkerchief. How many World Service listeners hearing the play for the first time, I wondered, might have been persuaded that the silly old Moor would eventually get a grip, see through Iago's villainy and sail off into the sunset with his missus? Not one, I bet, because there was no mistaking the unplumbable depths of evil in Malik's voice, especially in those chillingly sinister asides. Maybe it was the contrast between the voices of Iago and Othello, played by Hugh Quarshie, that made this such a memorable production. Get that right and everything else falls into place. </p> <p>Real-life villains don't come much bloodier than Slobodan Milosevic, the former Serbian president, due to start his defence on Tuesday in The Hague at the International War Crimes Tribunal on a charge of genocide. Heaven knows how long this particular performance will run (the prosecution's case took two-and-a-half years), especially if the former dictator is allowed to have even half the number of witnesses he is demanding - which, by the way, include Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. </p> <p>In <strong> The Real Slobodan Milosevic</strong> presented by Clive Anderson on Five Live we heard an extraordinarily wide range of people talking about the ex-president - diplomats, politicians, schoolfriends, relatives, victims - but for me it was Milosevic's voice that said it all. It had that unmistakable arrogance, like General Pinochet's, that comes with power. It may or may not have been the voice of a genocidal monster but it was certainly the voice of a man who feels he is above the law. Anderson, a lawyer himself, is canny enough not to offer his own opinions. He gives you the evidence, a great deal of it, and leaves you to draw your own conclusions. No doubt we will hear the plaintiff's own version of the Srebrenica massacre which may not tally with the one offered by a young Bosnian Muslim who miraculously escaped the killing fields. But we also heard an eyewitness describe Milosovic's reaction when he was told about Srebrenica two weeks later. He was furious and started throwing things. 'Which idiot ordered these massacres?' he yelled. At this stage of the war, said the witness, he was looking for a political settlement. It was the meticulously researched profile we have come to expect from Anderson. I especially liked the friend who said that Slobo and his wife Mira, who met at high school, were as passionately in love as Romeo and Juliet. Shouldn't that be Macbeth and Lady Macbeth? said Anderson. </p> <p>Evil may be too strong, and definitely too libellous a description of the voice of a veteran African politician called Rafael Branco who featured in a new four-part documentary on the World Service called <strong> The Story of African Oil</strong>. Reporter Maurice Walsh whose own voice had that attractive Irish lilt which call centres immediately recognise as trustworthy, started his tour in the Gulf of Guinea where the island of Sao Tome is poised for a massive oil boom. It needs one. Sao Tome may look like paradise with its sun-drenched, palm-fringed white sand beaches, but the average wage is US$200 a year. Unfortunately the above Mr Branco, who is no longer in active politics, did a deal with the Nigerian government three years ago which effectively handed over most of the potential oil revenue to Lagos. There was a further consideration, something to do with $500,000 paid into a bank in the Virgin Islands to - how shall we put it? - oil the cogs, or even grease the palms, of the people that brokered the deal. Was this true, Walsh asked Branco? </p> <p>In a voice that put you in mind of pashminas and peaches, Branco replied that he knew nothing about any such discrepancy though it was indeed unfortunate that Sao Tome's interests had not been better served. Enter Iago: 'Put money in thy purse,' he advised Rodrigo. Someone in the Gulf of Guinea certainly did.</p>",
  "<p>In a community college deep in the Bronx, two smart-suited men are struggling to stick to the rules of a presidential-style debate. Fernando Mateo, a businessman and community activist who spoke at the recent Republican National Convention, is defending his President. Miguel Mart\u00ednez, a Democrat councillor in Manhattan and former teacher, is pointing out that 1.6 million jobs have been lost during this administration. The main issues are education, healthcare, employment - issues significant for all Americans, but this debate has been staged in order to focus on the specific needs of a community that both parties are courting ferociously this year as never before: Latinos. </p> <p>Mateo and Mart\u00ednez are Dominican-Americans. Despite a Yankees game going on nearby, the auditorium is filled with young brown faces, and the opponents are drowning out the miked-up moderator. 'Our children are disproportionately in bad schools!' Mart\u00ednez exclaims. 'There are 1.5 million Latinos looking for work! 13.2 million without health insurance!' Mateo counters with even less favourable figures under Clinton. </p> <p>The most oft-repeated fact of this election is that it will be won in the 'swing' or 'battleground' states. It's less commonly known that in five of those states - Florida, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada - Latino voter turnout and preference will be decisive. </p> <p>Last year, the Census Bureau announced that Hispanics were the majority minority in the United States. They are 20 per cent of New Yorkers, 40 per cent of Angelenos, and there are cities in Texas that are 80 or 90 per cent Hispanic. One in eight Americans is of Hispanic origin. More of them than ever before - about eight million - are expected to go to the polls this year, and a large number of those people are not tied to either political party. </p> <p>So far, however, their voting strength is not equal to their proportion of the population; many of them are not yet US citizens, though a legalisation programme in 1986 increased those numbers, and they will continue to rise. Perhaps more surprisingly, one third of Latinos are under 18 - they are the youngest minority in the country, which means the groundwork done by the candidates in this election will have an even greater effect in the next one. A Democrat pollster in Florida recently announced that 'the battleground voter is the Latino'. But Latinos are more than that - they are the future. </p> <p>It's striking that this vote is so genuinely up for grabs: although 60 or 70 per cent of Latinos now vote Democrat, that's nowhere near the 80 to 90 per cent the party gets from the black community. Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, vice president for policy at the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) in Washington, the largest Hispanic civil rights organisation in the US, explains: 'What we've been saying is, the first candidate that figures out how to talk to us about education and healthcare in a compelling way, from either party, can lock up this vote. What is a source of great frustration is that the political process tends to look at immigration as the number one issue affecting Latinos, and then move on.' </p> <p>Immigration is an important issue - the last census counted 28 million first-generation immigrants, the highest number in history, and a significant proportion of those are Hispanic. But in every nationwide poll among Latinos, it has not been the number one issue. Sixty per cent of Latinos are US-born citizens; many live in mixed-status families, and so are more likely to be won over by the sort of immigration reform proposed by John Kerry (offering a path to equal citizenship for 8 million undocumented workers). But their prime concerns are those of any other American - only, you might say, more so. </p> <p>'The bottom line is, we are more likely than any other Americans to lack health insurance,' Mu\u00f1oz says. 'We are twice or three times as likely to drop out of high school, we are both more likely to be working and more likely to be poor.' That disadvantage has not been addressed by either candidate - though, to be optimistic, there may be some truth in the suggestion by one Bush-Cheney campaign official that 'Latinos are better off and more empowered if both parties are fighting for them'. </p> <p>The term 'Hispanic' came into official use in 1973, when the Nixon administration formally divided Americans into five races. As a result, according to the political commentator Michael Lind, the category reflects 'political imperatives, not cultural realities'. (Now the terms 'Hispanic' and 'Latino' are used interchangeably, though liberals prefer the latter, on the grounds that the Spaniards were the very people who destroyed the indigenous cultures of Latin America.) Many people call themselves Latino, but the people referred to in this way come from 22 countries of origin - how could they all be the same? </p> <p>There are Mexican-Americans (predominantly), Dominican-Americans, Puerto Rican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, and so on; first-generation, second-generation, third-generation immigrants. All have different cultures and views. As Ruben Mart\u00ednez, a writer and professor at the University of Houston, puts it: 'To say that a Cuban who fled the Castro regime in 1959, has voted Republican in every election and lives quite well-off in Miami has anything in common at all with a recent Mexican immigrant who's picking strawberries in California and lives in a trailer home, is just an utter illusion. It's a marketing term, and it's a term used by politicians at election time.' </p> <p>What is common to them all is their increased visibility - not just in numbers, but in terms of power, in all spheres. Jennifer Lopez, Salma Hayek and Benicio del Toro are some of the best-known actors in the world; then there are pop acts like Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin; bestselling writers including Sandra Cisneros and Fran cisco Goldman; baseball heroes like Sammy Sosa; fashion designers like Oscar de la Renta. Latino political voices are getting louder - the last US Treasurer, Rosario Marin, was Latina; Bill Richardson, a Native American-Mexican-American, is the Democrat governor of New Mexico. Latinos are excelling in business, and are more prominent in the military. Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez is the Coalition ground commander in Iraq, and 10 per cent of the soldiers fighting there are Latino. And there lies a crucial issue: whatever their origins, these people are American - and even prepared to die for it. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington published Who Are We? , an extravagantly controversial tome which claimed that this wave of Hispanic immigration was a threat to America's national identity. Spanish-speaking immigrants, he argued, consistently failed to assimilate. But demographic studies show quite the opposite, that Latinos assimilate overwhelmingly. 'You know,' says Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, 'the whole purpose of immigrants coming here is to achieve the American Dream, which is in some ways the ultimate in assimilation.' </p> <p>Douglas Knight, chairman of ImpreMedia, the largest Spanish-language newspaper publisher in the US, thinks the issue is slightly different. 'What's happening is this kind of parallel culture - in other words, it's not like it's a continuum that goes from no assimilation to complete assimilation. There's actually this middle ground of people who are completely assimilated, thank you very much, but also have a very strong Spanish language heritage. I mean, these are Americans, and they love being in America. But they speak two languages and share two cultures.' </p> <p>My name is Maria Elena Durazo, vice president at large of the Here International Union. My parents are immigrants from Mexico and our family of 10 children worked in the fields of California as migrant farmworkers until I was in high school.' </p> <p>Durazo was speaking to a committee on education and the workforce at the House of Representatives. She is one of the highest-ranking Latinas in the labour movement. Her story might have been scripted for Ken Loach: she began as one of the least empowered, and is now instrumental in obtaining power for those like her. Although the membership of her union is 70 per cent Hispanic, she was the first Latina to head a local union in southern California. Durazo has ensured that large numbers of Latino workers - and they are almost half of the new entrants to the American workforce - are informed and organised enough to vote. Behind the scenes, her work has an enormous knock-on effect on national politics. And her personal history means she is perfectly placed to understand the needs of the people she now represents. </p> <p>'I started as an organiser in the gar ment sweatshops,' she says. 'I got hired as an organiser at Local 11 [the union of hotel and restaurant employees of which she is now the president] and for four years I witnessed a union deteriorate right before my eyes. The meetings were held in English only; the office closed down at 4pm - the time most members were getting off their shifts.' Durazo earned her law degree while working at the union, and managed, among other things, to quadruple pension benefits for members. Nationally, she has created allianceswith the immigrant rights and civil rights movements, and has got civil rights leaders from the black community to say: 'this movement and ours are the same'. </p> <p>In his book Crossing Over , Ruben Mart\u00ednez followed a family of migrant workers not unlike Durazo's. The son of Mexican and Salvadoran immigrants, Mart\u00ednez felt compelled to document the lives of 'outsiders' because, as he remembers, 'up until the third grade, I was the only Latino kid. I didn't want to stand apart, I wanted desperately to fit in - I felt I was pushed into that outsider's role. And from that point on, this became the essential question of my life. </p> <p>'I consider myself an American,' he continues, 'but I am often not considered one. I've been accused of traitorist tendencies, but the fact is I was born here. For the better part of my adult life I've used the term American to describe myself, and tried to claim the real promise of what American means, and to define it in terms that do include me.' </p> <p>In the last lines of Sandra Cisneros's bestselling novel, The House on Mango Street , the narrator whose name means 'hope' leaves her Latino community armed with books and paper. 'They will not know,' the book ends, 'I have gone away to come back. For the ones left behind. For the ones who cannot out.' [sic] In a sense, Cisneros and other writers of the so-called 'Latina boom' have done just that. By mixing English and Spanish, by giving a voice to a people who had none, they have brought them into the mainstream - fetched the ones left behind. Nina Marie Mart\u00ednez, whose first novel, Caramba! , has just been published to great acclaim, might be seen as a liberated descendant of that movement. But Mart\u00ednez herself resists that kind of categorisation. </p> <p>'When I sat down to write Caramba! - and this is the biggest clich\u00e9 in the world,' she tells me, 'I wanted to write the Great American Novel, because this is what my slice of America looks like.' Mart\u00ednez was brought up by an American mother and a Mexican father, speaking no Spanish at all (she learnt it as an adult, and became 'an immigrant to my own culture'). She dropped out of high school, became a single mother at 20, and to support her child when she went back to college, started selling vintage clothes in flea markets in California. </p> <p>'We all have different dreams,' she reflects. 'I just got almost $700 for a purse I paid 50 cents for. It's like what I do for a living is a metaphor for my life. I look very vulnerable on paper - high school dropout, single mother, Latina, no real job - but I'm not. My daughter's a straight-A student, she's very mature for her age, she dresses like Audrey Hepburn. I consider myself to be very blessed that I've figured it out. You know,' she says, offering up an image that might stand for the hopes and rewards of many new Americans, 'you get the purse for 50 cents and you sell it for $700.' </p> <p><strong>Americans don't like to leave America -<br>True or false?</strong></p> <p>Yep. Fewer than 20% of Americans actually own a passport, though 70% have been to Disneyland. Reasons Americans give for not wanting to travel: 51% cite fear, 26% express no desire to go overseas, 6% say they want to see the USA first and 7% just don't like to fly. For those who would travel abroad, European destinations are the most frequently named as the preferred destination, with Britain just edging out France and Germany at the top of the list.</p>",
  "<p>It is no coincidence that the two most popular books at my father-in-law's beach house this summer both revolved around conspiracies to murder and challenged readers to unpick byzantine narratives replete with false leads and murky religious imagery. But whereas Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code provided light relief from the increasingly depressing news flowing from Iraq and a potentially neutral conversation-opener, the 9/11 Commission Report was, in the hands of my father-in-law at least, literary anthrax - a lethal weapon that unlike Saddam's WMD, was very much primed and ready to go. </p> <p>Hoping to avoid argument, my brother-in-law Jimmy and his wife, Brenda - Democrats both - had packed The Da Vinci Code for their August break at the New Jersey shore. Knowing that in a presidential election year, especially one as charged as the present campaign, argument was inevitable, my father-in-law, Jack - a confirmed Bush supporter - had brought the 9/11Commission Report. The ceasefire lasted about as long as it took us to change into our swimming trunks. </p> <p>I can't recall what started it now. Probably, I made some passing reference to Michael Moore. The next thing I knew, Jimmy had raised the so-called 'Saudi flights' issue - the claim, central to Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11, that in the days after al-Qaeda's attack the Bush administration had shown favouritism to members of bin Laden's family and other prominent Saudis by allowing them to charter private jets out of the country. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Jack reach for the report and turn to a page he'd marked earlier. Suddenly he was reading aloud: 'We found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals, domestic or international, took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning of 13 September, 2001.' </p> <p> 'Do you hear that?' he shouted, thrusting the book under Jimmy's nose. 'A bipartisan committee of the House and Senate found no evidence ! Look, even your beloved Kerry signed up for it.' </p> <p>Two months later, the argument is still raging. This time the venue is Jack's apartment in midtown Manhattan where Brenda, Jimmy, his elder brother, also called Jack, and their sister Susie, have gathered to watch the Sunday afternoon football game. It is two days after the second presidential debate, the New York Giants are trailing Dallas 6-10 at half-time, and the subject this time is media bias. Jim, a union organiser and bartender at a hotel in Times Square, and Brenda, a book-keeper for a fashionable downtown restaurant, are convinced the debate was a victory for Kerry. Jack senior, a retired senior partner at the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, and Susie, who teaches first graders at a Catholic parochial school in the South Bronx, are equally adamant it was a tie. However, Susie and her father are incensed that nearly all the networks called the debates in Kerry's favour, while Jim and Brenda are still fuming that on the day of the first debate the New York Post and Fox, both Murdoch-owned organisations, published pictures making it look as though Kerry had spent too much time under a sun lamp (their brother, Jack, who runs his own video-conferencing business, is somewhere in the middle). </p> <p>'It was a made-up story,' fumes Jimmy. 'If anyone had a fake tan it was Bush.' </p> <p>'Why didn't he deny it, then?' his father shoots back. </p> <p>'Because then it becomes more of a story.' </p> <p>'In the latest debate he looked totally different,' says Susie in support of her dad. </p> <p>'No, I disagree Sue,' says Jack junior, sounding a conciliatory note. 'I saw the photo in the newspaper where he looked orange, but I didn't see it in real life.' </p> <p>'He probably got the tan out parasailing,' scoffs Jack senior. </p> <p>'He might have,' admits Jimmy, 'but then he didn't have an orange tan - he had a tan tan, a real tan!' </p> <p>Susie laughs, then turns to her father. 'You see, this is the Democrats,' he tells her. 'I don't have a tan, yes I do have a tan. Flip-flop, flip-flop.' </p> <p>Welcome to the Armageddon election, an election which pits fathers against sons, and brothers against sisters, and in which no one can agree any longer on the time of day. Never mind the war in Iraq. The battle for the hearts, souls and ultimately the votes that will decide who gets to occupy the White House for the next four years is far more bloody and divisive. </p> <p>America has always been polarised along racial and geographic lines. What makes the 2004 presidential election campaign such depressing viewing is that the war of words between Republicans and Democrats is increasingly dividing families along generational and cultural lines. In New York this summer I heard countless stories of children who were no longer on speaking terms with their parents because, while they were holding up placards outside the Republican convention in Madison Square Garden that read 'Somewhere in Texas a village is missing its idiot', their parents were back in Branson, Missouri, running Bush registration drives. </p> <p>Take Nancy Kricorian, an American-Armenian novelist and activist in 'Code Pink Women for Peace', a liberal grouping of New York women opposed to the war in Iraq. Kricorian says she has long given up trying to engage her father in reasoned debate. Although her parents live in Massachusetts - Kerry's home state - both are born-again Christians and, under pressure from their Bible studies group, have all but pledged their votes to Bush. </p> <p>'The problem is that if you're at all informed about what's going on, then, from my point of view, it's impossible to vote for Bush,' explains Kricorian. 'What's depressing is my children are now beginning to pick up on the divide. Djuna, my youngest, says, \"Grandpa Eddie's a Republican, right, but we still love him don't we?\" ' </p> <p>In Code Pink, she says, nearly every woman has a similar tale. 'It's like there's no common ground. People are tearing their hair out.' </p> <p>What makes the divide so baffling is that it has very little to do with substantive issues, such as abortion and taxation, and everything to do with perceptions about red-state versus blue-state America. Thus in the Republican heartlands or the red states, the myth is that voters live simple God-fearing lives punctuated by shopping expeditions to Wal-Mart and patriotic rallies for the troops in Iraq, whereas in the blue states, or the coastal Democratic regions, voters drink latte, drive Volvos and sneer at ostentatious displays of religion and militarism. </p> <p>Just as in The Da Vinci Code, everything hinges on arcane symbols and covert meanings, so in this proxy war it's not what you say so much as who you are and the way you say it that counts. That is why Moore's attempt to undermine Bush's image as a regular red-state kind-of-guy by exposing his family's ties to the Saudis so rankles Republicans and results in books with screaming titles like Why Michael Moore is a Stupid, Fat White Man . And that's why Fox's attempt to undermine Kerry by drawing attention to his tan - an effeminate blue-state signifier if ever there was one - gets under the skin of Democrats. </p> <p>If anything, this proxy war seems to be getting nastier. Driven by ruthless party machines backed by shadowy single-interest groups and pliant radio and cable TV pundits, it offers little pretence any longer at reasoned debate. Instead we have yah-boo playground exchanges in which tired allegations get endlessly recycled and everyone tries to shout louder than the next person. </p> <p>But is the divide between the red states and blue, between Michael Moore's America and Rush Limbaugh's America, as deep as it appears? After all, nothing sells newspapers like conflict. Even Graydon Carter, the normally well-mannered editor of Vanity Fair, a glossy title to which political partisanship has hitherto been anathema, has declared an interest, arguing in his new book, What We've Lost , that under Bush Americans 'are more divided than at any time since the Civil War'. </p> <p>But what if the chasm between red and blue is little more than a media construct? For example, although my American in-laws can take fiercely partisan positions, a lot of their arguments are less about the policies than about their perceptions of the candidates. And when it comes to bedrock issues such as taxation, balancing the budget and healthcare, the differences between them rapidly shrink. Both Jimmy and Jack, for instance, would like to see cheaper prescription drugs from Canada made legal, whereas their father agrees with Bush that there are safety considerations and there shouldn't be a rush to legislate. But none of them wishes to see America go over to a system of socialised medicine such as we have here, and though Jimmy thinks Bush misled Americans over the threat posed by Saddam's WMD and his supposed link to al-Qaeda, he agrees with his father that America needs to stand tough against terrorism. </p> <p>This interpretation - that Americans are far more united than they think - is supported by a number of leading academics. In Culture War? The Myth of a Polarized America, Stanford political scientist Morris Fiorina cites polling data showing minuscule differences between red- and blue-staters on a slew of issues ranging from the death penalty to gun control to race. Majorities in both camps strongly oppose giving black people preference in hiring while also wanting government to guarantee that black people are treated fairly by employers. Similarly, majorities of both blues (64 per cent) and reds (62 per cent) believe that corporations in America have too much power, and they're against outlawing abortion completely or permitting it under any circumstances. </p> <p>Fiorina concludes that reports of a culture war are mostly 'wishful thinking'. 'The bulk of the American citizenry is somewhat in the position of the unfortunate citizens of some third-world countries who try to stay out of the crossfire while Maoist guerrillas and right-wing death squads shoot at each other.' </p> <p>Alan Wolfe, a political scientist at Boston College, and the author of One Nation After All , goes further, arguing that Graydon Carter and other media commentators are just plain wrong. 'Compared to earlier periods - the Civil War, the 1930s, the 1960s - our disagreements now are not that deep,' says Wolfe. 'Indeed, it is only because we agree so much on so many things that we can allow ourselves the luxury of thinking we are in a culture war.' </p> <p>But hang on. If it's simply a phoney war got up by the media, why did half a million protesters take to the streets of Manhattan in August? I was in New York that week, and the divisions couldn't have been starker. On one side, wearing face paint and parading effigies mocking Bush and his justifications for war, were the massed ranks of the angry and disfranchised - what the Conservative commentator David Brooks in his bestselling book Bobos in Paradise stereotypes as the 'the New York Times -reading, body-piercing, Hollywood-loving, left-wing freak show'. </p> <p>On the other, dressed in neat polyester dresses and suits and holding aloft flip-flops mocking Kerry's vacillating position on Iraq, were the serried ranks of the conventioneers - good Republican 'folk' in Brooks's parlance, the sort of people who, when they aren't standing behind a New York police cordon in their convention best, dress in overalls and baseball caps and attend Nascar motor-racing rallies. </p> <p>One answer is that while Americans may be less divided than they think on economic and moral issues, they certainly are divided over the war in Iraq. And, in the case of Bush and Kerry, it's personal (according to aides close to Bush, Kerry really does make him 'scowl', reminding him of the haughty New England elite types he met, and disliked, at Yale). However, there's also more to it in that. Thomas Frank, the author of a new book, What's the Matter With America? , points out that the red state/blue state divide has its roots in the culture wars of the 1960s - a war that the conservative right lost. In the 1980s under Reagan, Republicans had no need of culture war rhetoric because free markets were in the ascendancy. It was only when the stock market bubble burst and Americans began looking critically at the new economy that conservatives began mobilising voters on such explosive issues as a foetus's right to life and a Baptist's right to teach creationism. </p> <p>According to Frank, this was mainly a political ruse, a way of harnessing the pent-up resentment at 'liberal values' - the gains made by the left in the Sixties on a range of social and cultural issues - in support of pro-business economic policies. Frank traces the genesis of this strategy - what he calls the 'Great Backlash' - to the early 1990s and Newt Gingrich's famous description of Democrats as 'the enemy of normal Americans'. </p> <p>'In the backlash imagination,' he writes, 'America is always in a state of quasi-civil war. On one side are the unpretentious millions of authentic Americans; on the other stand the bookish, all-powerful liberals who run the country but are contemptuous of the tastes and beliefs of the people who inhabit it.' </p> <p>Frank, like Fiorina, thinks this divide is largely an illusion - a myth put about by Brooks and Limbaugh and their allies at Fox. But where he differs with Fiorina is in recognising that it has immense rhetorical power - especially now that liberals are taking to the streets to demonstrate in an echo of the anti-Vietnam protests of the 1960s. </p> <p>'Democrats make a terrible mistake in not acknowledging the volatility of the backlash,' says Frank. 'They brush it off as crypto-conservatism but the passion and anger is very real. It's no use saying conservatives live in a parallel universe and that they're totally whack. The conservatives have succeeded in convincing people that the media lies to you, and in a very high-stakes election like this one, that can make a big difference' </p> <p>For my family, this process goes back at least to the Clinton impeachment process in 1998. Then, as now, I recall fierce cable TV-fuelled arguments at the New Jersey shore, with my father-in-law arguing that Clinton should go because, like Nixon, he had lied, and Jimmy arguing equally fiercely that there was no comparison between Clinton's understandable embarrassment about his affair with Monica Lewinsky and Nixon's deliberate cover-up of the Watergate break-in. There was a brief respite in the summer of 1999 when John F. Kennedy Junior took a wrong turn somewhere over Long Island Sound - a news flash I watched live from the shore (as for a lot of America, Kennedy's death underlined for my father-in-law the nation's loss in 1963 when Jack Kennedy, the only Democrat he'd ever voted for, was assassinated). But with the disputed 2000 election returns in Florida and the row over 'hanging chads', normal hostilities resumed, and since 9/11 it has only got worse. </p> <p>By this I don't mean to imply that my in-laws are for ever at each other's throats. In Irish-American families, as in many Jewish-American families, argument - even vehement argument accompanied by large amounts of alcohol - can be a form of communication, and usually the worst consequence is a hangover the next morning. But what has become more noticeable under Bush is how entrenched the sides have become and how much time is now spent disputing each other's sources. </p> <p>Take the row over John Kerry's Vietnam war record. Last week, one of America's biggest television companies, the conservative Sinclair Broadcast group, announced plans to air a documentary in which former Vietnam PoWs will accuse Kerry of 'lies, false testimony and distortions' for his remarks in Congress in 1971, saying US troops had been responsible for atrocities in Vietnam. Sinclair plans to screen the film nationwide the week before the election - a move which could potentially influence the outcome of the 2 November poll. </p> <p>But the attack on Kerry is nothing new. Questions about Kerry's record first surfaced in the dog days of August when another group of ex-Vietnam vets, the Orwellian-named 'Swift Boat Veterans for Truth', took out a series of ads saying Kerry did not deserve the three purple hearts he'd been awarded in Vietnam, and raised similar questions about his heroism. Although the New York Times published a detailed rebuttal of the group's claims and exposed their link to senior Republican campaign contributors, my father-in-law remained unswayed, and two months later it makes little difference that Jimmy has brought yet another newspaper cutting backing Kerry's version. </p> <p>'It says here that the navy officially credited Kerry with 20 kills in action,' says Jim, reading from the article. 'Commanding officers described him as \"gutsy\" in quotes. That's the final authority.' </p> <p>'You're assuming that article is quoting the entire record,' replies Jack senior sceptically. 'The one thing I can't accept is he's had three purple hearts in four months. That's impossible. You have to be seriously wounded to get a purple heart. When was there time for him to be in hospital?' </p> <p>This time even Jimmy's brother is exasperated. 'Why would the Department of Navy award him the medals if he didn't deserve them?' says Jack Jr. 'Come on Dad, be unbiased for a minute. If this were a flip and Bush had gone to Vietnam and the Democrats were on record as saying he deserved his medals, you'd be holding this up in Jim's face.' </p> <p>But if Jack senior refuses to accept evidence that contradicts his prejudices, the same might also be said of Jimmy. It's no use Jimmy and Brenda being incensed by Sinclair's plans to screen the documentary attacking Kerry's war record, says Jack. What about Michael Moore's announcement that he intends to show Fahrenheit 9/11on pay-for-view on 1 November. Isn't that a similarly blatant attempt to sway voters? </p> <p>'No, Michael Moore is right,' insists Jimmy, reaching into his wallet for another newspaper cutting. He holds up the headline for his father to read: '9/11 Probe Up In The Air On Osama Kin Flights.' </p> <p>'Listen to this: \"It's no longer certain that Saudis did not fly out of the country immediately after the terrorist attack.\" The Commission kept on going back and forth. First they said there was no flight on the 13th, then they said there may have been a flight from Tampa to Louisville.' </p> <p>Jack examines the cutting. It is dated 7 June - nearly a month before the commission completed its inquiries. </p> <p>'But Jim, the commission came out later with a separate report addressing that exact question. It didn't say we're not sure there weren't any flights, it said we are positive !' </p> <p>Later, when tempers have cooled, I ask my family what they think about the divisions in America. According to the latest analysis of voting intentions by pollsters Zogby international, Kerry and Bush have split the electorate right down the middle, with the Democratic contender leading the incumbent by the narrowest of margins. </p> <p>'There's definitely more animosity,' says Jack Junior. 'It's more mean-spirited.' </p> <p>'Fifteen years ago we had plenty of heated debates in this room - but it wasn't the same,' agrees Jimmy. 'There's so much more to play for today.' </p> <p>'In the past, it was more clear cut,' says my father-in-law. 'The Democrat candidate stood for this and the Republican for that. I think what we're arguing about here more is what the facts are.' </p> <p>He looks at Jack Junior for confirmation, then Jimmy and Brenda. For once, everyone nods. The next moment there's a cheer from Susie in the next room. The Giants have turned the game around in the second half and have beaten Dallas 26-10. </p> <p>Now that's one result everyone can agree on. </p> <p> <strong>Americans are very patriotic - <br>True or false?</strong></p> <p>True ... fully 84% of US citizens say they are very proud to be American. Almost everyone else (12%) says that they are 'somewhat' proud. Only 2% are ambivalent, while another 2% say they are downright embarrassed to hail from the US of A. The proud members of the American public are also in 100% agreement that the US flag is the best possible flag and are unanimous in their love for it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mark Honigsbaum's latest book is Valverde's Gold: a true tale of Greed, Obsession and Grit (Macmillan)</p>",
  "<b>Wanda Sykes</b> <br>Comedian/writer/actor <p>Born in Virginia in 1964 and brought up in Maryland, Wanda Sykes worked for the National Security Agency (where she claims to have worked on 'spy shit') before getting her break as a writer and performer on HBO's The Chris Rock Show . In 2001 she won the American Comedy Award for outstanding female stand-up. She's also guested on Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm and the Drew Carey Show. Sykes specialises in a kind of mouthy, confrontational comedy that takes in mainstream politics but more often race and gender politics. On airport security: 'There's nothing random about it. You get to the gate and they're standing there with their Sherwin-Williams paint chart. If your ass is darker than khaki, you're getting searched.' On women: 'Even if we're not looking for a man, a woman will put on a sexy outfit just to piss off other women who are looking. It's like, \"Girl, you thought you were getting laid tonight? Watch this shit. I got a man at home, but I'm still going to ruin your fun!\"' </p> <p>Sykes says of her early material: 'I was definitely softer. At first it's just telling jokes and all that Hey! Howya doin'?' But then you have to put more of yourself out there and take risks - express who you are and stand by it.' She's just published her first book, a compilation of jokes and stand-up material entitled Yeah, I Said It , endorsed heartily by Jane Fonda, but less so by the American Libraries Association, who wrote 'Fans will find the book amusing, but the occasional profanity will limit its appeal,' and is now busy with a new reality show for Comedy Central, Wanda Does It , in which she attempts various low-paid jobs; while repossessing someone's car, she was told, 'Shit, Wanda, is that you? Why don't you get back into comedy?' 'I think he felt a little sorry for me,' she says, 'thinking my career was over.' </p> <p>Far from it. Sykes has just finished filming Monster-In-Law with Fonda and Jennifer Lopez, to be released next year, and is currently touring with a new stand-up show. The comic Dave Chapelle says of her 'not only did we male comics respect her, many feared following her. No man wants to get beat by a girl. <br><b>Stephanie Merritt</b></p> <p> <b>Zach Braff</b><br>Actor/writer/director</p> <p>It's not hard to see why Zach Braff has been described as the next Woody Allen. The 29-year-old Jewish actor/writer/director has just made an unconventional romantic comedy, Garden State, about an underachieving twentysomething who falls in love with Natalie Portman, playing a pathological liar with epilepsy, when he goes back to New Jersey for his estranged mother's funeral. </p> <p>It's a tribute to Braff's assured direction that this quirky cocktail turned out so well. Best known as the star of Channel 4's US hospital sitcom Scrubs , Braff hawked his debut script around Hollywood for a year. 'Studios, financiers, production companies, they all passed on it. They kept saying the film was \"execution dependent,\" which is just fancy lingo for \"We'll believe it when we see it.\"', he has said. His persistence paid off when he persuaded a former banker to finance the $2.5 million movie. Earlier this year it was a hit at the Sundance film festival where Miramax and Fox Searchlight bought the rights for $5 million. </p> <p>US reviewers have compared the film to The Graduate ; youthful angst and suburban alienation coupled with Simon and Garkfunkel on the soundtrack. In Garden State , Braff plays Andrew Largeman, an out-of-work actor dependent on prescription drugs. Although Braff isn't a pill-popping slacker, the character is based, to a degree, on himself. His mother and stepfather are psychologists; his father, a lawyer, is now married to a therapist. 'I had a lot of therapy in my life, and I know a lot of people on mental health-related pharmaceuticals,' he has said. Braff also kept notebooks of overheard stories, newspaper clippings and personal anecdotes which he referred to while writing the script, one of which inspired the scene where hotel workers drilled holes in the walls to watch guests having sex . </p> <p>Raised in New York, Braff got his first professional role aged 14, oppo site Gwyneth Paltrow in a TV pilot. After attending film school he worked as a production assistant on music videos for artists such as Sting and the Spice Girls. He returned to acting and was working as a waiter when he was cast in Scrubs . Braff is currently filming the latest series of Scrubs but he is also fielding offers from Harvey Weinstein and working on his next film project, an adaptation of Doris Burn's novel Andrew Henry's Meadow. Success, however, hasn't changed his laid-back attitude. 'A lot of directors tend to be intense control freaks, and it was worrisome that he wasn't that way,' Portman has said. 'But he's a confident guy. To be a director, that's what you have to do. He demands confidence in others.' <br><b>Akin Ojumu</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Garden State will be screened at the London Film Festival on 23 October </p> <p><b>Barack Obama</b><br>Politician</p> <p>It is a measure of the great expectations placed on the slim shoulders of Barack Obama that a man who is not yet even a senator is now spoken of as a future presidential contender. Obama burst onto the national political scene this summer with a lavishly praised speech at the Democrat convention in Boston. Victory is almost a foregone conclusion in his Illinois senate seat. That will make him only the third black senator since the 19th century and - perhaps, just perhaps - pave the way for him to be the first black president. </p> <p>Obama was born of a black Kenyan father and a white mother from Kansas. His parents separated early and he was brought up mainly in Hawaii by his white grandparents. Obama's brains got him into a top Hawaii school and from there he studied law at Harvard before moving to Chicago to become a civil-rights lawyer. He trounced better favoured rivals to win his party nomination for the senate race. Many voters in the plummiest areas of Illinois, who would never normally vote for a black candidate, suddenly flocked to his banner. Politically, Obama comes from the left of his party and fought hard and controversially against the death penalty but his views are expressed with such reason and grace that he has many Republicans singing his praises. He also has a modest side, referring to himself as a 'skinny guy from the south side of Chicago with a funny name'. It's a humility that could veil a president-in-the-making.<br><b>Paul Harris</b> </p> <p><b>Charlotte &amp; Samantha Ronson</b><br>Designer and DJ</p> <p>Part socialite party twins, part multi-tasking creative powerhouse, Charlotte and Samantha Ronson have elevated the business of being young, buzzy and beautiful in Manhattan into an art form. Samantha is a DJ and singer/songwriter, Charlotte is a fashion designer. In combination, they're quite the hippest thing to happen to New York since Chloe Sevigny. </p> <p>Daughters of professional rock wife and NY society queen Ann Jones, step daughters of Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones, sisters to alpha DJ Mark Ronson, their entr\u00e9e into any fashionable scene they fancied was assured and effortless. It wasn't, however, until they fell in with producer and one-man brand extension exercise Damon Dash that things took off for them professionally. Samantha met Dash on the club scene. 'I thought Samantha was a cool chick,' he says. 'She had a great taste in music, and her sneaker game was on point.' Samantha played Dash a demo of her music through her iPod one night, and he immediately signed her. She's now in the habit of playing intimate gigs at terminally cool venues such as LA's Viper Room, and her forthcoming album, Red , features collaborations with Damon Elliott (Pink, Destiny's Child), Dallas Austin (TLC, Monica, Brandy), and so on. Meanwhile, Charlotte's label, C Ronson, is produced through Damon Dash, rampantly endorsed by celebrities and stocked in fashionable contemporised department stores such as Fred Segal, Henri Bendel and Tracey Ross. As well as in her own Nolita boutique. Obviously. The Ronsons' social antics are endlessly discussed on the New York Post 's gossip sheet, Page Six and earlier this year, Samantha featured on Quest magazine's 'utimate guest list' alongside assorted Roosevelts and Rockefellers. Tatler put it like this: 'If you're under 30 years old in New York and you don't know the Ronson twins, chances are you should get out of town.' Indeed. <br><b>Polly Vernon</b></p>",

Having Quentin Tarantino as president of the jury pretty well ensured that some award would go to Park Chan-wook's ingenious, extremely violent South Korean thriller <strong> Oldboy</strong>. It took the second prize, the Grand Prix du Jury, which unlike the Palme d'Or is traditionally reserved for the picture in competition that most advances the art of the cinema. </p> <p>If this year's Palme d'Or winner, Fahrenheit 9/11, was the most obviously topical movie on view in Cannes, Oldboy , like a good many pictures around at the moment, deals with the dangerous, equally current subject of revenge, exulting in it as it condemns it. The film also touches on that abiding theme in the arts over the past 80-odd years, that we are not masters of our fate, that we're being manipulated. Oh Dae-su, (Choi Min-sik) a Seoul businessman, is arrested and released during a drunken spree, but is abducted on his way home. For 15 years he's kept in some private windowless prison seeing no one and drugged when in need of attention. He has books and a television set from which he learns that he's wanted for the murder of his wife. He keeps a joint diary and autobiography to examine his past for clues to his incarceration and to record his changing state of mind. He also turns himself into a powerful fighting machine. Suddenly he's released into a changed world, looking like a wilder, more ragged version of Charles Bronson, ready to go on a revenge trip like the Count of Monte Cristo, with whom he identifies. </p> <p>On emerging he discovers that his daughter has been adopted by a Swedish couple, and that the person who had him locked up is playing games with him, laying a trail of clues that lead into the past. As the title Oldboy hints, the ultimate solution lies in his schooldays. There is also a deal - if the hero can solve the conundrum he'll survive and his ludic tormentor will kill himself. Revenge is proverbially a dish that, like sushi, tastes better cold, and appropriately Oh Dae-su meets a young virginal sushi-bar waitress with cold hands. She becomes his helper and lover during his search. </p> <p>This polished, highly accomplished picture features mysticism, hypnotism, a girl who reads Sylvia Plath, a Catholic high-school run on western lines, state-of-the-art surveillance systems, and a good deal of physical and psychological violence, A thriller in the manner of Se7en , it's a modern variation on the Oedipus myth and, so we infer, some sort of allegory about a divided Korea's relationship to its captive past and troubled present. Oldboy has opened more widely in the British Isles than any previous Korean movie and is something of a breakthrough for that country's cinema. </p> <p>A 'kahuna' is a Hawaiian word for village elder or shaman and is used in American business circles as a variant of honcho for the boss man in a company. In <strong> The Big Kahuna</strong>, adapted but not opened up by Roger Rueff from his chamber play, three men from the marketing department of a Chicago lubricants firm wait in a hospitality suite they've hired at a convention in Wichita, Kansas. One is a sad old-timer in his fifties, fed up with his job (Danny De Vito); another is his close friend, fortysomething, cynical and aggressive (Kevin Spacey); the third is a naive, idealistic, newly married born-again Baptist in his twenties (Peter Facinelli). Their aim is to grab the attention of the elusive 'big kahuna' of a major conglomerate, whom they've never met. The movie is a poor relative of The Iceman Cometh, Death of a Salesman and Glengarry Glen Ross , but as well as some good dialogue, especially in the early stages, there are terrific performances which presumably explains why it has eventually been released here four years after its American opening. </p> <p> The Big Kahuna has no visual interest. Striking images are everything in the documentary <strong> Billabong Odyssey</strong>: incredible 60ft waves, 100 miles out at sea, being ridden by bronzed globetrotting surfers. With generous sponsorship from big corporations they track waves via satellite weather stations and fly around the world to be dragged towards their crests by jetskis. The people involved are romantic Baywatch types, hi-tech primitives living dangerously. Looking back to the early years of Hollywood, Sam Goldwyn once remarked: 'We have passed a lot of water since then.' The surfing community might say the same about the way the sport has been transformed over the past five years. Paddling out to go beach surfing is now for wimps. </p> <p>Remaining with the mighty ocean deep, we have <strong> Shark Tale</strong>, a disappointing DreamWorks animated feature, very like but altogether inferior to Pixar's Finding Nemo. The great animated movies, from Snow White and Pinocchio to Antz and Shrek, have a universal feeling. Shark Tale is a wholly American artefact, a Hollywood crime movie transposed to the sea bed. The sharks, a mafia family headed by Don Lino (Robert De Niro), threaten fish lower on the food chain until the godfather's vegetarian son Lennie (Jack Black) becomes friends with a vainglorious bling-bling fish (Will Smith) who works at the Whale Wash. The draughtsmanship of the GCI visuals has an anonymous blandness, the fish jokes are feeble and the product placement relentless. </p> <p>Keenen Ivory Wayans's <strong> White Chicks </strong> and Ed Bye's <strong> Fat Slags</strong> are the dregs of respectively American and British screen comedy. Wayans's picture stars his brothers, Shawn and Marlon, as incompetent black FBI agents who, for reasons not worth going into, disguise themselves as young blonde airhead heiresses to attend a fashionable Long Island gathering in the Hamptons. It is the work of film-makers who have seen Some Like It Hot several times but have never studied the way Wilder's film achieved its effects.

On a trip to London they're taken up by an American media tycoon who is temporarily brain-damaged after calling the Dalai Lama (Burt Kwouk) a cocksucker. With his help they become national celebrities, heading the pop charts and winning the Turner Prize.

  "<p>Perhaps Keith Miller would have approved, but there must be scores of Australian Test cricketers shaking their heads in bewilderment at events in Chennai. Australian batsmen keep walking off the pitch without waiting to see the upraised finger of the umpire. Adam Gilchrist and Jason Gillespie marched off; Mike Kasprowicz departed even though a bemused umpire David Shepherd had given him 'not out'. Ian Chappell must be leading the head-scratching down under. Barry Richards' assertion that 'the only time you ever see an Australian walk is when he has run out of petrol' appears to be outmoded. </p> <p> My guess is that Miller would have loved to have been a member of this Australian side. Ricky Ponting ('got any winners, Ricky?') or even Adam Gilchrist are more his type of Australian than Sir Donald Bradman, of whom Miller once said, 'I didn't get on with him as a man. We had nothing in common,' before adding: 'But as a batsman, captain and tactician he had no equal.' </p> <p> Miller would surely have warmed to the approach of the current team: the headlong pursuit of runs and wickets with only victory rather than the draw as their goal. He may have been more ambivalent about their training regime. He could have chugged along at the back of the pack alongside Darren Lehmann. </p> <p> Miller, who died last week, was not one of those who routinely castigated the modern generation. His old mate and fellow Brylcreem user, Denis Compton, once berated him at length about the trend for helmets, arm guards and chest pads, implying that the modern cricketer had gone soft. Miller patiently waited for the end of tirade before saying: 'Denis, if the helmet had been available in our era, I would have made sure you wore it.' </p> <p> Miller was a fiercely competitive cricketer when the contest was delicately balanced, easily bored when it was all too one-sided, as his famous duck at Southend in 1948 suggests. As Australia were on the way to amassing 721 against Essex, Miller showed no interest in the fray and let his first ball from Trevor Bailey hit his stumps. Apparently he was more interested in his game of poker in the dressing room. That he should have a sense of perspective about the game is easier to explain than the current altruistic tendencies of some of the Australia team. </p> <p> Miller was not affected by fear of failure and the 'pressure' that is a common lament of the modern cricketer. 'Pressure?' he once mused, 'I'll tell you what pressure is. It's having a Messerschmitt up your arse.' Miller was a fighter pilot during the Second World War and after one sortie he crash-landed his Mosquito in Norfolk. The search for the young Australian was fruitless until it transpired that he had hit upon a village cricket match nearby and had joined in. Or so the story goes. </p> <p> There are so many stories about Miller, the bon viveur , the dashing all-rounder and the hero of any self-respecting young Australian - or Englishman for that matter. You can never be sure of their historical accuracy, but that doesn't really matter. They help to reflect the glamour of the man. By comparison even Andrew Flintoff is a little grey. </p> <p> It is said that he once knocked on the hotel door of Bradman one night, dinner-suited and ready for action, to inform his captain that he had indeed been in bed at the time of the curfew, but now he was going out. He was a successful captain of New South Wales; Richie Benaud says that he was the best he ever played under and the best Australia never had.</p> <p> But attention to detail was not always his strength. When he realised that he had 12 men on the field at the start of a game in Sydney he blurted out: 'One of you bugger off and the rest scatter.' </p> <p>In this era , Miller would have been the marketing man's dream. Impeccably dressed, with his mane of unusually long black hair and dripping with charisma, he would have been advertising more than Brylcreem. Even in the 1950s his celebrity status loomed large. </p> <p>And so in true Aussie style it had to be punctured now and again. During a break in a state game in Adelaide Sid Barnes of New South Wales emerged with the drinks. He proceeded to brush the players' flannels, to spray deodorant into their armpits and to brush captain Miller's hair while holding up a mirror to his face while a portable radio played music in the background. </p> <p> Miller, we assume, would have welcomed the prank just as he would have upheld the right for Gilchrist, Gillespie and Kasprowicz to play the game their way in Chennai. In the meantime, whether batting or bowling, he would have been legitimately tearing into the Indians with every sinew. Since this is a contest that matters.</p>",
  "<p>Keith Miller's death last week marked the passing of a swashbuckling hero with a cavalier spirit. The great Australian all-rounder inspired tributes as a dashing, debonair, romantic warrior. Michael Parkinson described him as a man who 'played cricket hard, but for fun'. </p> <p>Does his like still exist? In Andrew Flintoff and Wayne Rooney, arguably it does. Two supremely talented sportsmen who play their respective games with flair and natural instinct, seemingly unafraid and unaffected by the dreaded disease of 'pressure'. Miller's early experience as a fighter pilot in the Second World War gave him the right to pronounce thus: 'When athletes nowadays talk of pressure, they only reveal what they don't know of life. They've never had a Messerschmitt up their arse. That's pressure.' </p> <p>It is one thing to have the experience to be able to put a sporting situation into such clear perspective, quite another to explain it to a youngster who thinks that Messerschmitt is the latest German goalkeeper. </p> <p>The ability to control nervous tension or anxiety, to channel it into something that enhances performance, is as much a part of sporting prowess as speed of reaction, muscular strength or fluidity of movement. A brilliant athlete who cannot handle the big occasion is as useful as a fountain pen with no ink. </p> <p>To pooh-pooh pressure, though, is to rob sport of part of its extraordinary power. After all, as viewers of sport, we imagine the tension of those we are watching and recreate it for ourselves. Why else would we bite our nails throughout a Tim Henman match, or grab the dog as Jonny Wilkinson shapes up for a drop-goal? We cannot feel the same as they do, but we enjoy sharing the moment with them. It is a thread in the rich fabric of sport. </p> <p>As for the ones actually kicking or hitting the ball, the nervous tension is part of the reason that they got involved. They actively seek the adrenalin rush of competition, they enjoy the racing heart and the sweating palms. Different folk have different methods of coping with the anxiety of the big moment. </p> <p>Britain's greatest Olympian, Sir Steve Redgrave, used the technique of visualisation to prepare himself for the infrequent but crucial races. In the years leading up to his fifth and final gold medal in Sydney, Redgrave would use any opportunity - behind the wheel, or pushing a trolley around a supermarket - to consider what the opposition might do to unhinge the British four. </p> <p>Throughout his autobiography, Redgrave does not dwell on pressure, if that is what we have come to call it, but on the expectations he has of himself and how best to fulfil them. </p> <p>One often hears athletes talk of falling short of the expectations of those around them. After her desperate experience in the Olympic marathon, Paula Radcliffe said she felt that she had let everyone else down. Her tears were shed not just for herself but for all those she had disappointed. There were those who argued that the occasion, the attention and the publicity had got to her. </p> <p>Keith Miller would no doubt have disapproved of Radcliffe's emotional breakdown. However, athletics is her life and has been for as long as she has been an adult. She has had no opportunity to 'put things into perspective' because there is no time to combine training with another job, no chance to broaden the mind with other experiences. Colin Jackson told me once that losing a race, for an athlete, was like a death in the family. </p> <p>'I know it shouldn't be,' he said, 'but when you spend every day of your life training for a race and it goes wrong, you grieve as if someone has died. It is that serious.' </p> <p>There are ways of keeping a grip on the gravity of a life in sport. Professional footballers, for all the stick they get, are encouraged to partake in local youth programmes, to help with charity work, and in the local community. Some, regrettably, are required to do so by law, but a surprising number do so of their own volition. </p> <p>Whether these encounters with the outside world help their mental state, who knows? Perhaps it should be part of a study into what makes up the psyche of the modern sports icon. </p> <p>I remember being very nervous before the Sports Personality of the Century TV programme. I had only a small part but was terrified that I would fall over walking down the steps of the studio or stumble over my opening words. I saw Gary Lineker, casually leaning up against a door and asked him why he didn't seem nervous. 'When you've taken a penalty for England in front of 70,000 baying fans,' he said, 'this doesn't make you nervous.' </p> <p>It's all relative. </p> <p>Then there is the money. Does a winning cheque of \u00a31million make it harder to hole a putt on the 18th green? Does money concentrate the mind or distract it? It all depends upon the individual. </p> <p>Lee Trevino once said: 'True pressure is when you are playing for $50 a hole and you only have $5 in your pocket. Focuses the mind and tightens the rear end.' </p> <p>There is no right or wrong theory. Pressure is self-inflicted, but it can be increased or decreased by what others expect and by the relative financial necessity to win. No modern sportsperson can know the 'real pressure' that Keith Miller experienced as a fighter pilot - and they should be grateful for that.</p>",
  "<p>Haafhd gave tears of joy to his trainer's eyes when running on strongly from halfway to beat Chorist by two-and-a-half lengths with Azamour a length back in third in the Emirates Airline Champion Stakes on his first attempt over 10 furlongs. </p> <p>Barry Hills, whose third win in the race it was following Cormorant Wood in 1983 and Storming Home two years ago, has been training for 36 seasons. But seldom can a win have given him so much pleasure on a day when top-class races come thick and fast. </p> <p>Ridden by his son Richard, 12-1 shot Haafhd was always travelling well and when Chorist went for home under Kieren Fallon three furlongs out, the chestnut son of Alhaarth had little trouble tracking the mare through before bursting clear a furlong-and-a-half from the post. Idling slightly, Haafhd was still firmly in control as he returned in triumph to the scene of his 2,000 Guineas win in May, when Azamour was also third. </p> <p>Hills senior, with his composure recovered, said: 'From halfway he was always going to win. I said after the Guineas that he was the best miler I have trained, but I have always looked forward to running him over a mile-and-a-quarter. This opens up new options for next season like the Eclipse and the Juddmonte International.' </p> <p>Also the winner of the Craven Stakes over the Rowley Mile before the Guineas, Haafhd loves a straight course and Hills will not be considering a trip to Lone Star Park, Texas, for the Breeders' Cup later this month. </p> <p>For another trainer, Mark Johnston, the Champion Stakes proved disastrous. He came into the race with two apparently good chances of success, but his Lucky Story failed to stride out on the soft ground and finished tailed off - and, much worse, stablemate Mister Monet had to be pulled up by Kevin Darley. The Peintre Celebre colt suffered a severe fracture of a hind pastern. </p> <p>Yet in the previous race, Johnston had greeted home his second winner of the Cesarewitch when Contact Dancer hung on by half a length from Mr Ed at the end of the gruelling two-and-a-quarter miles. </p> <p>Winning jockey Royston Ffrench, one of the all-too-few black people involved in British racing, was also notching his second Cesarewitch, having been successful aboard Inchcailloch in 1996. For a lightweight jockey like Ffrench, who can do weights under eight stone with comfort, opportunities in big races are thin on the ground, but he seized this chance with both hands. </p> <p>Contact Dancer, who relished the very soft ground, was sent off at 16-1. He was having only his third outing for Johnston after being transferred from John Dunlop in the spring by owner Michael Watt. </p> <p>Johnston, whose other win in the race came in 1998 with Spirit Of Love, said: 'I am pleased for Michael as he has had several horses with me, but this is my first winner for him.' </p> <p>If Ffrench has had what Johnston described as 'an up-and-down season', then the trainer himself must have saddled the unbeaten Shamardal with some trepidation for the day's Group One two-year-old event, the Dewhurst Stakes, the race after poor Mister Monet's mishap. </p> <p>Immediately into his not inconsiderable stride against the stands rail, Shamardal, with Darley on board, never looked likely to be pegged back as he galloped to favouritism for next year's 2,000 Guineas, winning by two-and-a-half lengths from Oratorio. </p> <p>'The best of times and the worst of times,' was Johnston's philosophical reaction to his topsy-turvy couple of hours. 'I have spoken to the vet, Andrew Edgar, who was on the scene with Mister Monet and he has told me that the injury is bad.' So bad, indeed, that poor Mister Monet had to be put down. He leaves behind the memories of his fine front-running wins in Group races at Haydock and Deauville. </p> <p>Shamardal, the trainer said, had always shown star quality at home, 'from the moment Keith Dalgleish first sat on him on the gallops. Keith said he was something special.' </p> <p>Johnston said of the Giant's Causeway colt's impressive performance: 'I was surprised to see a couple of them trying to lie up with him as I told Kevin anybody leading him will be going too fast.' </p> <p>Darley described Shamardal as 'the best two-year-old I have seen over this trip.' There will be another furlong to travel in the Guineas, but this powerful animal looks sure to relish it. Coral offer him at 5-1 for the first colts Classic. </p> <p>Asked whether he would one day develop into as good a horse as the one he says is the best he has trained, dual 1,000 Guineas winner Attraction, Johnston said: 'When he has won four Group Ones, ask me again.'</p>",
  "<p>Stuck at the wrong end of the Premiership, Harlequins can ill afford to forget rugby's basics if they are to gain the momentum needed to boost their fragile confidence. But their start here was sloppy. Essentially, though, they need a win. It did not arrive, and they have now equalled the club's record of eight defeats on the bounce: seven this campaign to add to the reverse in the final game of last season. And, with a trip to Munster next up in the Heineken Cup, these are, to say the least, tough times. </p> <p>Twice early on, indiscipline allowed easy penalties and, as Quins chief executive and head coach Mark Evans will have reminded them at half-time, this is particularly blameworthy when the league leaders are in town. Tigers fly-half, Andy Goode slotted both opportunities. </p> <p>But Quins improved, and this is something for Evans and the Stoop faithful to cling on to as the season unfolds. 'I thought we played well first half and didn't deserve to be down,' said Evans. 'But then the game just dribbled away from us.' </p> <p>That Andre Vos's team matched Leicester in performance, at least early on, was indicated by them entering the break trailing by the odd missed penalty from Staunton's boot. In open play, Quins were the brighter in the first half and could boast the deeper foray into enemy territory when Tani Fugi broke through midfield. Staunton duly collected his second penalty. </p> <p>No player could take control. Goode has some attrac tive devil about his play, but when he made half-breaks through the Quins three-quarters, he proceeded to drop the ball or pass to no one. The home crowd sensed that Leicester could be beaten. But as the game crawled along insipidly you felt, actually, that Johnson's men would gradually wear Quins down. </p> <p>Which they did. Goode missed two penalties after the break and converted one. Quins never looked like threatening as they had earlier and could not even boast a missed penalty to their name in the second period. </p> <p>The game had, essentially, been played in midfield with a healthy element of feeling that had featured, among other things, the fists of Quins' lock Simon Miall, some Johnson skulduggery at the ruck and the decision of Matt Henjak, Quins' little scrum-half, to get intimate with at least four Tigers forwards. </p> <p>'It was a bad game but we won it,' said Leicester coach, John Wells. 'All credit to them for not giving an inch. Balls were flying from each side. The top team played the bottom and there was only six pints' difference. That's how tough this league is.' </p> <p>The deficit means last season's Parker Pen champions gain a bonus point. That is some cold comfort at least. Leicester, meanwhile, have lost just once. And it is European rugby time again. The Tigers will fancy it just a little more than Quins. </p> <p> <strong> HARLEQUINS</strong> : Duffy; Harder, Greenwood, James, Keogh; Stanton, Henjak; Jones, Fuga, FitzGerald (Lambert 62) Winters (Rudzki 57), Miall, Easter (Tiatia 59), Vos (capt), Diprose. </p> <p><strong> LEICESTER:</strong> Murphy; Vesty, Smith (Cornwell 21), Rabeni, Holtby; Goode, Bemand (Ellis 57); Morris (Rowntree, 60), Chuter, White M Johnson (capt) Kay, Corry, Back, W Johnson. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> D Pearson.</p>",
  "<p>And so, the first slice of the season is over. The domestic now gives way to the European. After two jaw-droppingly physical Zurich rounds at Leicester and here, Bath must be looking forward to some Heineken light relief. Bourgoin are unlikely to provide it. </p> <p>Wasps, as champions of both England and the Continent, probably don't mind whether they play internally or externally. They came here with half a team out injured, played on the back foot and squeezed out a victory. </p> <p>It wasn't even exactly businesslike, for their umbrella defence was often left flapping, their scrummage was uncomfortable in the first half and they offered little broad vision in attack. But for bloody-mindedness, it was first-rate. There will be more handsome clubs in rugby, but few do resilience like Lawrence Dallaglio's bunch. </p> <p>Bath began in ecstasy. For nearly a minute they looked in the mood to rip any side apart, whether good-looking or resolute. They retrieved from the kick-off and went this way and that, threatening with every pass to score. Wasps scrambled the ball away again, and back came Bath. Lee Best then threw the killer pass... and it fell into the safe hands of Bath old boy Tom Voyce, who strolled in from 60 metres. </p> <p>It wasn't exactly a fluke try for the visitors, because Mike Tindall, of all people, nearly gifted them another interception try just a few minutes later. But it wasn't the result of many hours of minute choreography on the training ground. </p> <p>It wasn't going to be a day of slickness for Wasps. Olly Barkley ran through them a couple of times; Best and Brendon Daniel had a run or three; Robbie Fleck, too. Wasps were on scramble alert. Their first-up defensive line wasn't at its most devastating, but Jonny O'Connor was everywhere. </p> <p>Bath tried to drag these loose defenders into something more bound to the set piece. While Duncan Bell was doing his stint of scrummaging - he was replaced on the half-hour by Matt Stevens - Bath opted to reset a five-long series of five-metre scrummages, despite being awarded free-kicks and penalties during the sequence. </p> <p>They did not manage to shunt Wasps back over the line, and in the end took the three points on offer when the opposition front row went up again. But not many teams would fancy their chances of out-muscling the Zurich champions at the set piece. </p> <p>It seemed that the direct assault up front would have greater reward elsewhere. Tindall was soon clean through the middle. But he looked to offload in vain. Nobody was quite there. </p> <p>And, when, 12 minutes later, it seemed that Andrew Higgins had eventually found a way through, video replay revealed he had lost control of the ball at the end of his dive over the line. All the good work had come to, well, not exactly nought, for Barkley had added another penalty, but to not much. A long penalty by Ed Thrower meant that Wasps were four points ahead at the interval. </p> <p>Thrower had two early chances in the second half to stretch the gap, but he failed to land either penalty attempt. But at least his team were at the right end of the field. It was as if they had swapped back foot for front in the changing room. </p> <p>Bath still managed to make a couple of clean breaks, but they failed to put the final pass away. And Wasps were making them launch their breaks from a long way out. While they were in the territorial ascendancy they were ticking up the points. Thrower readjusted his sights and landed two penalties, and James Brooks dropped a neat goal to keep the lead at 10 points after Barkley's third penalty. </p> <p>The emphatic nature of the win was upset by Chris Malone's late try. Bath had landed a try-scoring pass at last. But they never came close to the line again. They go into Europe spitting slightly in frustration. Wasps go in with jaws clenched and sinews bursting. It is the way of the champions, wherever they play. </p> <p> <strong> BATH: </strong> Best (Malone 74); Higgins, Fleck, Tindall, Daniel (Davey 47); Barkley, Wood (Walshe 52); Barnes, Humphreys (Mears 58), Bell (Stevens 31), Borthwick (capt), Grewcock, Beattie, Lipman, Fea'unati. </p> <p><strong> WASPS: </strong> Van Gisbergen; Thrower, Richards, Erinle (Hoadley 74), Voyce; Brooks (King 79), Biljon; Payne, Greening (Leota 61), Green (Mackenzie 61), Hart, Birkett, Worsley, O'Connor, Dallaglio. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> S Lander.</p>",
  "<p>After three days of delay, of squelch and mud, of lift and clean and occasionally of hit and hope, the World Match Play title will be contested today by Ernie Els and Lee Westwood, two of the most easygoing golfers this side of whatever is on the other side. It should be a classic, a masterclass in rhythm and ball-striking. At stake is a first prize of \u00a31million, second place bringing in \u00a3400,000. </p> <p>While Els trundled around Wentworth in his usual, slightly absent-minded fashion yesterday, eventually defeating an out-of-sorts Padraig Harrington 5&amp;4, Westwood's day swung nervously between nonchalance and jittery unease, although no one would have guessed it from the Englishman's eternally affable facial expression. Five holes ahead of Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez and operating on cruise control, Westwood missed a short putt on the 11th green that brought his opponent back to life. </p> <p>Suddenly the Spaniard saw, if not actually light at the end of the tunnel, at least a tunnel. He understandably went for broke, Westwood understandably played within himself and waited for Jim\u00e9nez to mess up. He had to wait a long time. An eagle at the long 12th and then a flurry of birdies and the gap between them had shrunk from five holes to one with just the 18th to play. Now Jim\u00e9nez really could see some significant light, which was just as well because darkness was beginning to shroud the West Course. </p> <p>What he didn't see was one of the bunkers that can pull in a fractionally off-line drive and as his ball slipped over the edge and into the sand his body folded in half back on the tee. To Westwood's great credit he bludgeoned his ball into perfect position, sliding it in high and away from the bunkers and from where he struck a three iron to within 20ft. It was enough. Jim\u00e9nez came up short and then pitched to 10ft. Westwood had two for it. He took them and turned to find his Ryder Cup team-mate smiling and holding out a congratulatory hand. </p> <p>'Someone asked me earlier this week what was the greatest, most exciting match I've ever had here. The answer is this one. That was terrific out there. Miguel played some blinding stuff over the last six holes and I just tried to keep my balance. I'm pleased to say I did. Now I'll get an early night, get back up and take on Ernie. It should be fun,' he said. </p> <p>Victory today will propel Westwood back into the top 25 in the world rankings, a fabulous achievement for a golfer who tumbled so far down this list that two years ago search parties had to be sent out to locate him somewhere around 250th. </p> <p>How does it all go wrong in the first place? No one knows. It does not take much to unbalance some world-class golfers, but Padraig Harrington is not usually bothered by minor distractions. </p> <p>It takes more than a rustle to upset the jaunty Irishman as he goes about his day's work. What it takes is rather foolishly, and certainly painfully, bashing his right thumb against a tree, which Harrington did during Friday's play. </p> <p>He did not need any sort of handicap before taking on Els. While Harrington walks briskly from tee to ball and then to green, Els ambles along. If Els was a dog he would be a big, old labrador. Harrington, on the other hand, would be a Jack Russell and quite probably, given the evidence of this week, barking up the wrong tree. </p> <p>Three down at lunch, he could have rectified things swiftly in the afternoon and he cannot blame the thumb for two missed birdie putts at the opening holes. Instead of winning them Harrington, head shaking in frustration, lost the long third and Els was too distant a target. In truth Els, as with much of this soggy week, has not had to dig too deep to take matches. By the time he won this one 5&amp;4, he was nine under par for the 32 holes played. To date Els has won in 1994, '95 and '96, 2002 and 2003. Only Gary Player and Seve Ballesteros equal this record as it stands. </p> <p>Now Westwood offers a fresh challenge, as the defending champion has lost twice to the Englishman in the past, two of just four defeats he has suffered in 25 matches played over the past decade. A bit less labrador, a bit more terrier is now required. Sometimes, even for the top pros, it can be a bit of a dog's life.</p>",
  "<p>New management, same old story. For 80 minutes, Leicester looked comfortable enough to win this game. Then, in the last 10 minutes, they came unstuck and were lucky not to lose it. An own-goal from Chris Makin cancelled out Dion Dublin's effort and only the intervention of a post prevented Eddie Johnson's fierce shot from winning it late on for Coventry. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Dave Bassett, who took over as Leicester's caretaker manager, with Howard Wilkinson as coach, after Micky Adams quit last Monday, was in typically ebullient form, making light of Leicester's plight. 'Since Adams has gone, the temperature's dropped, it's not stopped raining and I've now got a cold. Thank you, Micky,' he laughed, when asked whether he was enjoying his return to management. </p> <p>So does he want the job full-time? 'If we're winning, I want to be the manager. If we're losing, I'll stick with being director of football,' he said, with a wink. 'I'd like to be considered for the job obviously, but there will be no animosity from my point of view if they decide it's not me.' </p> <p>Dublin, a one-time hero at Highfield Road, was repeatedly booed by the home crowd, having turned down an offer of a return to his old club in the summer. He responded by scoring a tap-in from six yards after an otherwise disconsolate David Connolly had done the hard work down the right. </p> <p>'If I was a betting man, which I'm not, I think I might have had a few quid on Dion getting the first goal,' said Coventry manager Peter Reid. 'It's sod's law, isn't it? It was just a shame that Eddie Johnson couldn't win it for us at the end, because that was a fantastic bit of skill.' </p> <p>Johnson received the ball with his back to goal, turned quickly and shot early, beating Kevin Pressman, but not his right-hand post. </p> <p>Coventry fans should take encouragement from the arrival of Rohan Ricketts, on a month's loan from Tottenham. So full of creative industry was he down Coventry's left, that he had to remove his sodden vest midway through the first half. Though he tired and had to be brought off in the second period, his quicksilver footwork suggests Reid may have struck gold. </p> <p>'Overall, a draw was about right,' Reid said. 'Our build-up play was great, but the final ball was not up to standard.' On the one occasion when it was of the requisite quality, Coventry scored, Makin unfortunately turning in Andrew Whing's wicked cross 10 minutes from time.</p>",
  "<p>A taxi driver negotiating a street in west London one morning last week might have been surprised to see a white-haired pedestrian suddenly launch a perfectly timed run to cross the road just in front of him. If the cabby recognised Dave Mackay, he might have reflected that had they collided his vehicle would have come off worse. </p> <p>At the peak of his playing powers, Mackay, renowned as a ferocious competitor - although he insists the hardman image does him a disservice - was one of the outstanding players in what was arguably the finest club team in England in the twentieth century: the Tottenham Double-winning side of 1960-61. With his little shimmy across the road as we make our way to the comfort of a hotel bar for a chat, Mackay shows impressive agility for an OAP - and that life's challenges, however incidental, are still worth rising to. Interviewee then waits patiently as interviewer makes a more measured crossing. </p> <p>Born in Edinburgh in 1934, Mackay is just a few days short of his seventieth birthday, which seems an appropriate time to seek the thoughts of someone who, considering he was such a towering presence in the game, has not been heard enough. The man who shares with Kenny Dalglish the distinction of being the only ones to win the English league as player and manager - Mackay managed Derby to the league title in 1975 - and be voted footballer of the year talks with a beguiling and softly spoken trenchancy while liberally deploying his favourite adjective, the present participle of the f-word (not included in this piece, if only to save space). Whether he is comparing the game as played in his day or merely telling anecdotes, he makes compelling listening. </p> <p>Appealingly, he appears devoid of anger even though there is plenty for him to be rancorous about, from the ridiculously meagre 22 caps he won for Scotland, to the left leg that was twice broken in unedifying circumstances and that so disrupted his career, to the paltry living a pro in his day scraped together compared with the rewards on offer today. </p> <p>Mackay compensated for his slim wage packet as a player with lucrative contracts coaching in the Middle East in later life. Still, he might be expected to be less accepting than he is about his miserable spending power as a player. 'We wouldn't go up to the West End because the West End was too expensive,' he says of his time at Tottenham (1959-68). 'We'd just go round the corner to the Bell and Hare.' His only comment on this is that to be able to drink so close to the ground came as a shock after his days at Hearts when such a practice was out of the question. 'When I went to Tottenham, wee [Terry] Dyson said to me, \"Davy, are you going for a drink?\" I said, \"OK, I'll follow you.\" He said, \"Follow me? It's just round the corner\".' </p> <p>Apart from money, the way the game has changed most, says Mackay, is the fluid formations teams now use. He remembers the first time he encountered a side who dispensed with the traditional line-up of two full-backs, three half-backs and five forwards was when Spurs played Alf Ramsey's Ipswich in 1961-62, when Ramsey was making the experiments that would eventually take England to World Cup triumph. 'We went down there to Portman Road and we didn't know who to pick up. They had three through the middle and no wingers. Peter Baker [the Spurs full-back] was saying, \"Hell, there's nobody on the wing, what do I do?\" They beat us home and away but only because of the system. When we then played them in the Charity Shield at Ipswich we beat them 5-1 because we had sorted out our formation to counteract theirs.' </p> <p>That Tottenham side 'played lovely football', says Mackay, which is not something he is seeing from the present team - in action tomorrow at Portsmouth - although that may change. He thinks the new manager, Jacques Santini, knows what he is doing. Even Bill Nicholson, the manager who was the mastermind behind the 1960s Double-winning side, took a year to 18 months to turn things around, Mackay recalls, and so can Santini, 'provided he is given more money and can buy two or three players'. </p> <p>Mackay concedes that carefully controlled diets and a less lenient approach to drinking in the English game mean many players are in better condition than they were, although one important reason that the game is quicker is modern materials. 'The ball nowadays is so light, it flashes about - and you can score from 40 yards. When I started, the ball was so heavy you couldn't score from the 18-yard line; if you did, it was the goalie's fault.' </p> <p>On the other hand, he believes the modern game is less physical, and only partly because of laws that provide players with greater protection, while the shirt-pulling and fouling at set pieces, particularly at corners, are new. 'The thing that annoys me is that at every corner, it's either a penalty or a free-kick the other way. I see them pushing and shoving and think, \"Look at that\". It's simply crazy. The referees don't seem to do much about it.' </p> <p>The subtext of what Mackay is saying seems to be that the niggling infringement has replaced the full-blooded clog - which was almost as likely to go unpunished as today's less blatant misdemeanours. This was famously the case in 1963 when Mackay suffered a terrible leg injury in a clash with Manchester United's Noel Cantwell, whose action went uncensored by the referee. Mackay's left leg was shattered, the noise of it splintering being heard all around Old Trafford. 'It didn't get broken, it got smashed. When I go to Old Trafford each year, people still say to me, \"I was there, I heard the crack\",' Mackay says. 'That toe was up there.' He points to a spot not far from his left kneecap. </p> <p>Our discussion of the incident goes like this: </p> <p>'What did you think of the Cantwell tackle?' </p> <p>'It wasn't a tackle.' </p> <p>'What was it then?' </p> <p>'I've got to be careful because I can't pay him. When I see him I always say, \"Eh, he broke my leg\". I saw him at an England game at Derby, I'm in a crowd and he's in a crowd, and as I walked past I said, pointing at him, \"He broke my leg\". Which he did.' </p> <p>'Would you have a drink with him if he came in here?' </p> <p>'Yes - if he bought it.' </p> <p>Mackay does say that Cantwell did not intend to break his leg. 'No one intends to break your leg.' </p> <p>'So why did he do a job on you?' </p> <p>'Because I was a good player.' </p> <p>The broken leg had two unfortunate sequels. Nine months later it was broken again when Mackay played in a reserve game at Shrewsbury. He describes the tackle on that occasion as diabolical and adds that he knows who did it, 'but I would never mention his name'. Then in August 1966, soon after making his return, he famously tangled with Billy Bremner in a Spurs-Leeds match at White Hart Lane. Mackay admits he nudged Bremner over at a throw-in, but wasn't prepared for what happened next. 'Billy gets up and doesn't kick the right leg, which is nearer to him; he passes that and kicks the broken one. He knows which one's been broken. I could have killed him.' </p> <p>Once again the referee saw no reason to punish either player, but the oft-published picture of the incident has, Mackay feels, counted heavily against him. 'It portrays me as being a bully.' He stopped the publisher using it on the cover of The Real Mackay , the autobiography that came out recently. 'The thing that upsets me most of all is when people say, \"Oh, he's a hard man\", as if I couldn't play the game. I could play it every bit as well as anyone else.' </p> <p>Those who watched him and played with him will attest to Mackay's formidable presence both in physical terms and the quality of his play. It was his competitive drive, though, that really distinguished him, and he admits as much, saying he would always be the voice of the team even if he wasn't captain. 'I cannot explain it, it's just my nature.' His party tricks included flicking a penny from his shoe on to his forehead and then getting it to slide down to cover his eye. </p> <p>Yet, he still played only those 22 games for Scotland. Injury was one reason, and so was his presence in the Scotland team that lost 9-3 to England at Wembley in 1961. For some reason, the selection committee who chose the team in those days made the Anglo-Scots, including Denis Law and Mackay, pay more dearly for the landslide defeat than the home-based players. Mackay was back in the side that returned to Wembley two years later and, despite being reduced to 10 men, won 2-1. 'We were lucky this time because we had a bloody goalkeeper.' </p> <p>Try to placate Mackay by reminding him that at least he scored in that 9-3 defeat and he says: 'Aye, it would have been 9-2 if it hadn't been for me.' </p> <p>It is a pity we haven't heard more from Dave Mackay over the years.</p>",

  "<p>FIRST THERE was a high-pitched mechanical scream and then, with engines full throttle, the Sea Harrier thrust along the ramp and propelled itself up and away from the floating runway. </p> <p>HMS Invincible, the Royal Navy's flagship, is one of only three aircraft carriers in the British fleet. It is also, in today's navy, a business unit, because the real crisis facing the navy is a battle with balance sheet and mounting costs. </p> <p>HMS Invincible is a typical example. It burns \u00a327,000 of fuel every day and its missiles cost up to \u00a31 million a pop. While it provides an essential role in executing foreign policy, the pressure is on to calculate what efficiencies can be made without reducing effectiveness. </p> <p>The government has been taking a long look at defence spending, first with the strategic defence review in 1998, and then in last summer's White Paper, which announced savage cuts. </p> <p>Like any fleet heading into uncharted waters, the admiralty has been looking at new strategies, and has turned to business for the solution. Navy top brass have decided their ships need to be run like medium-sized companies, with captains managing like chief executives. </p> <p>Combat training at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth will be supplemented with courses at the London Business School, and McKinsey, the management consultancy, has been inspecting the guard along with the admiral. </p> <p>New corporate structures have been implemented, with heads of departments on each ship in charge of areas such as warfare, air engineering and logistics, all reporting to quarterly management boards. Key targets have been set, and captains are responsible for marketing, procurement and recruitment, as well as leadership and morale. </p> <p>While the current round of spending cuts make these efficiencies all very relevant, they were not the main catalyst for change. The end of the Cold War that forced the navy to re-examine itself. It needed to redefine its purpose on the geopolitical map. For years the arms race meant an emphasis on matching forces, but when that disappeared the admiralty needed to develop new goals. </p> <p>'It is mainly in uncertain times, when you are looking at your strategic future that you put in the business practices,' says Commander David Charles, one of five heads of department on Invincible. 'Then, and when there is increased cost emphasis. When defence spending was reduced, all of a sudden we had to be careful about money. As soon as you do that, you start to examine business practices. </p> <p>'I have been far more financially aware in my last three jobs than ever before. I now have control of a \u00a31.8 million budget where I have to make business cases and conduct investment appraisals for any major capital expenditure. The Treasury does not sign blank cheques any more. It wants to see where you are spending its money.' </p> <p>But while the captain of an aircraft carrier faces similar business issues to a chief executive, the differences are extreme. His workforce is stuck at the office for up to six months at a time, so morale and discipline are important management issues. He is also unable to choose his team: staff are allocated in Whitehall based on strict career progression paths and he cannot choose sailors based on qualifications or personal skills. But the most stark disparity is when things go wrong - if a captain makes a mistake, failure has much more of a downside. </p> <p>'It's life or death, effectively,' says Neil Morisetti, who has been Invincible's captain since April. 'Life or death not just in war, but in peacetime. I might be chief executive of a medium-sized company, but this is a warship. I'm chief executive, mayor, chairman of the council and the magistrate of what is a small village.' </p> <p>Since the 1700s, there have been six Invincibles. The first, L'Invincible, was a French vessel captured off Finisterre in 1747. The present one was commissioned in July 1973 from Vickers' Barrow-in-Furness yard. It has served in the Falklands, the Adriatic, Bosnia and most recently off southern Iraq, where its Sea Harriers helped enforce the no-fly zone. </p> <p>An aircraft carrier is one of the navy's most expensive assets and is kept clear of front-line combat. It is escorted by destroyers, which are more agile and have superior firepower. </p> <p>Most of a carrier's weaponry is defensive. Invincible has two 20mm cannons and off-board decoys, plus Goalkeeper, a seven-barrelled 30mm gun that fires 4,200 rounds a minute. Positioned strategically around the ship, it creates a 360-degree 'wall of lead' and is the last line of defence to block incoming missiles. </p> <p>Invincible is mainly used as a strike platform to launch attacks and co-ordinate missions from its sophisticated operations rooms. It can support visiting army units and RAF squadrons. Its only means of attack is through the aircraft on its deck. These can range from Royal Navy and RAF Harriers as well as Chinook, Merlin and Sea King helicopters. </p> <p>In navy-speak, Invincible is the designated 'high readiness carrier', which means it may be required to deploy anywhere in the world at 48 hours' notice. </p> <p>This key requirement is at the heart of Invincible's business model. Each departmental business plan is geared towards achieving this goal. It is measured by an operational performance standard, which aims to put the 48-hour notice period into a workable percentage - all of Invincible's departments have to be at 85 per cent 'readiness' for war. </p> <p>This means not only that the weapons department needs to be able to get its hands on at least 85 per cent of the ammunition to go to war within 48 hours, but also that the chefs need to be able to source at least 85 per cent of the food needed for the duration in the same time frame. This would be easy if the ship sat in port 365 days a year, but it has to source everything within 48 hours wherever it happens to be in the world. In effect, this is Invincible's 'output', its business proposition. The percentage is set and measured externally by navy officials and ultimately government. </p> <p>'We measure it quarterly,' says Chris Skidmore, Invincible's commander of logistics. 'Each quarter we have a management board meeting with the captain and heads of departments. We feed the data into a scorecard and it allows you to take a view about the capability of the ship and its readiness profile. </p> <p>'For my lot, this means I need 95 per cent of food stocks on the shelf. So when we are on exercises, where we are consuming all the time, we have to forward plan to think about where we would source things should we be required to go to war. </p> <p>'The MOD has to work out the trade-off between this [readiness] cost and the amount of time it deems appropriate for us to be able to react to a situation. Ultimately, the cost of this is competing for Treasury funds along with health and education - it is policy-driven. We don't determine the capability; we are like a car production line. Jaguar says how many cars should roll off its line; we are measured by the right number of aircraft coming off our runway.' </p> <p>Logistics is one of five main depart ments on Invincible. It deals with pay, allowances and personnel, and caters for up to 1,100 staff from four galleys. It provides stores to all the other departments. Marine engineering is responsible for the ship's equipment, ranging from the air-conditioning and electrics to the engine and fuels. Sixty officers and ratings run the air department with air traffic controllers, meteorologists and radar and communications experts. Weapons engineering and air engineering comprise 29 and 70 staff, with the former looking after armaments, and the latter the repair and support of aircraft. </p> <p>There is also a sick bay with doctor and dentist, an executive department and a secretariat. All departments report to the captain, who ultimately answers to a first Sea Lord at the Ministry of Defence. He sits alongside Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary. </p> <p>In July, Hoon announced Britain's biggest military shake-up for years. He reduced the forces to their smallest since the Second World War, with the RAF losing more than 100 frontline aircraft and the navy 15 vessels. It will now buy only eight of the new Type-45 destroyers instead of 12, and the decision to buy two new aircraft carriers is at risk. </p> <p>Hoon said the government's aim was to ensure that growth in defence spending targets what the armed forces require in the 21st century rather than what they inherited from the 20th - the logic being to put cash into smaller numbers of highly manoeuvrable ground forces, with an emphasis on high-tech air power and special operations. This is the era of remotely fought battles - known in America as 'battlefield lite' - where there will be less emphasis on expensive hardware taken into a battle zone. </p> <p>Once Hoon has announced headline figures on rationalisation, the navy top brass have to make plans using the assets left to them. Like any business with limited resources and demanding goals, much relies on the ability of the chief executive and board. Business school and management consultants are not automatically associated with the armed forces, but both are quietly forming the building blocks of its future. </p> <p>In the past two years McKinsey, the management consultant, has been developing new systems at macro and micro level. One of its ideas, which it calls 'customer organisation', has been instrumental in the current rationalisation. </p> <p>McKinsey established the government's wish list of airborne and seaborne attack strategies, then worked backwards, across the forces, to establish what assets would be needed to achieve that. 'They looked at the effect we were required to deliver and analysed how to achieve that operationally,' says Skidmore. 'Pre-McKinsey, most of the buying was service-specific. Now when we buy a new asset, the way is to think what is required to achieve a specific capability. The aircraft carrier is incidental, a tool along with assets from the army and air force needed to achieve a certain goal. These customer organisations can be applied to staffing and marketing as well as procurement.' </p> <p>Jon Green, the navy's defence publicity spokesman, says consultants can dissect problems unemotionally: 'We are using external experts to give us that wider view of business practices. When you have grown up with something you can get too close - consultants are able to think outside the box. We are also sending people on full-year and part-time MBA courses, giving us the capability to grow our own business consultants.' </p> <p>Step forward the new breed of captain - saltwater in his veins but budgets on his brain. Morisetti was sent to the London Business School, where he topped up his knowledge of resource accounting and budgets alongside business leaders. </p> <p>'I drew on my own practical experience,' he says. 'The navy is much more proactive and forward-looking as part of joined-up government. In the past there has been wastage, like in any other industry. Our shareholders, the public, want to see value for money. We take pride in offering good value. </p> <p>'If we are doing training involving an aircraft, we make sure that enough ships are involved to justify that cost. I balance the ship's speed with fuel efficiency. At 12ft to the gallon, I am very aware of my fuel allowance. But we have to avoid balance sheets deciding everything. When choosing between capital expenditure or creating a new job, you need to bear in mind that labour might have a high through-life cost, but sailors are multi-taskers. An extra mechanic will also be trained to put out a fire - which a new air-con system won't. </p> <p>'I have outputs in the same way a business does. Like a business, I have resources and people, but I don't have an ability to go to the bank and get more money. I want a motivated workforce, but the difference is that my workforce does not go home at 5pm. By virtue of this fact I have wider responsibilities. I think we have recognised a need to be forward-thinking as an employer. It is cost-effective to keep and retain staff. We have to look at the whole person and a wider support system as an employer.' </p> <p>All ships now have warrant officers who look after welfare; there is satellite television, Playstations and organised sports. Morisetti is aware of work/life balance. He will steer his ship close to shore on occasion so that sailors can pick up a mobile phone signal. His biggest challenge is satisfying the needs of diverse generations, from 18-year-olds to seamen in their mid-40s. 'We are a lean, mean business machine,' he says. 'But at the same time a caring forward-looking employer.' </p> <p>Morisetti uses a balance score card system in which different areas are flagged green, orange and red, with red indicating a serious problem. His mission is not to turn the ship green because this might be at the cost of another ship in the fleet being completely red, but to find a balance. </p> <p>One area where the navy does generate indirect revenue is as a floating ambassador to support British trade. As well as hosting cocktail parties when in port, Invincible is used as a backdrop for British business launching into new markets. </p> <p>Standing on the bridge, Morisetti considers whether he could see himself running a plc. 'We certainly develop skills in the navy that are highly transferable,' he says. 'But whether I could run a blue-chip company and deliver high profits - that I don't know.' </p> <p><strong> A financial snapshot of HMS Invincible </strong></p> <p><strong>Cost of asset </strong> \u00a31.2 billion </p> <p><strong>Cost of Sea Eagle missile </strong> \u00a31m </p> <p><strong> Staff </strong> 1,200 (with aircrew) 650 (without) </p> <p><strong> Annual salary bill </strong> \u00a39m </p> <p><strong> Daily fuel </strong> \u00a327,000 </p> <p><strong> Daily food per head </strong> \u00a32.13</p>",

  "<p>CAPITAL markets can save the planet from global warming - and earn billions for financial institutions at the same time. That, at least, is what a growing army of City enthusiasts say about carbon emissions trading, the new way of making money from environmental restrictions. </p> <p>Banks and brokerages are piling in to trade in 'pollution permits', an increasingly prized commodity as regulation tightens. Gas-guzzling industrial corporations will soon be scrambling to buy these credits, and with the launch of a formal European-wide emissions market in the New Year, the international community of 'carbon brokers' is about to come of age. </p> <p>Permits equal to 1 million tonnes of carbon emissions were bought and sold in September alone, a twentyfold increase since the beginning of the year, according to consultancy Point Carbon. Russia's recent declaration that it will ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change is sure to boost the market further, as will alarming headlines that last week suggested global warming has begun to accelerate rapidly. </p> <p>Emissions trading is one of those unusual 'big ideas' that can claim a measure of support from environmentalists, businessmen and politicians alike. It follows a series of initiatives, usually led by the European Union, to reduce the amounts of carbon released into the atmosphere by factories, power plants, steel mills and even commercial office blocks. </p> <p>The plan is for big companies to be given an 'allowance' of carbon they can emit. If a company exceeds its permitted pollution quota, it will face a fine. If, however, it beats its allotted target, it can sell on the remainder of its allowance to other firms, which use it to extend theirs. </p> <p>From a government standpoint, the aim is to control - and gradually reduce - total industrial emissions while making it as easy as possible for the private sector to fall into line. </p> <p>Currently, emissions trading is based on swapping carbon credits at a future date. The EU scheme does not take effect until January and thousands of companies have not yet even been given their allocations yet. But there is little doubt in the Square Mile that emissions trading could be a very profitable branch of the commodities market. </p> <p>The likes of Barclays Capital and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein have been building their environmental markets teams, presumably in the expectation that carbon quota prices will go up. Cantor Fitzgerald, ICAP and a number of specialist boutiques, as well as the likes of Shell and BP, are also involved. </p> <p>London's International Petroleum Exchange is aiming to become the hub of global trading, on the basis of the City's experience of buying and selling emissions futures so far. It is also about to start trading in a range of new carbon derivatives. But volumes are sure to increase hugely once EU quotas become a reality, and several financial centres - not least the Chicago Climate Exchange, which has also run a carbon trading system, and the New York Mercantile Exchange - are considered just as likely to inherit the leading role. </p> <p>Russia's decision to move towards ratification of Kyoto is important because the treaty needed another big country's support to become legally binding. Controversially, the US has refused to sign up to the protocol, despite being the world's largest polluter, responsible for 20 per cent of all carbon emissions. </p> <p>However, the political will to combat global warming is increasingly there, not least from Tony Blair, who has described it as 'the most serious long-term threat facing the planet'. Britain plans to cut its emissions by 20 per cent by the end of this decade as its contribution to both Kyoto and additional EU efforts. </p> <p>The plan imposes particularly big cuts on electricity generators and coal-fired power stations and will be difficult to implement. The CBI, naturally, is not happy, warning that the government's targets risk 'sacrificing UK jobs on the altar of green credentials'. </p> <p>Rod Eddington, chief executive of British Airways, has said it is impossible for his company to cut its fuel consumption, fines or not. Business leaders also point out that no comparable obligations have been imposed on household emissions and cars, which together account for as much pollution as the industrial sector. </p> <p>In other words, carbon emissions will remain unpredictable and difficult to control with any precision, a point underlined by the fact that, to the government's dismay, emissions actually rose in 2003, a consequence of economic growth being 'higher than forecast'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, some environmentalists fear that tradeable permits will actually delay the day when some of the wealthier smokestack companies finally recognise the need to clean up their operations. They also predict that some will simply relocate offshore, to countries beyond the reach of EU fines. </p> <p>Alternatively, it is possible that the fines will not be punitive enough. The current price of carbon futures - equivalent to \u20ac10-\u20ac15 per tonne - has been rising sharply of late, but whether that proves sufficiently expensive to force big polluters to change their behaviour remains to be seen. </p> <p>After fierce lobbying, EU governments have shied away from imposing heavier fines on its industries, especially as their American competitors face no such obligations. Besides, energy and power firms can do what they always do - pass on their fines to the customers. If the EU scheme fails, it could mean even higher gas and electricity prices for us all.</p>",
  "<p>IF THE clever designers at Airbus had been asked to devise something to get up the nose of the Americans, they could not have come up with a better solution than their own chief executive. </p> <p>Noel Forgeard presses all the wrong buttons. First, he is in all but one respect (he prefers Coca-Cola to white burgundy with his lunch) very, very, French. </p> <p>And as Frenchmen will, he clearly delights in tweaking Uncle Sam's tail. So: he is bad at hiding his satisfaction in taking 'Aah-Boos' (as he calls the company he has headed since 1998) past Boeing, the once-untouchable totem of US civil aviation dominance. </p> <p>He is proud to bursting about the super jumbo A380, the most talked-about airliner since Concorde (another European production); and is happy to flaunt it as the US government and the European Commission enter a stand-off over subsidies that some fear could turn into a full-blown trade war. </p> <p>He insists that he does not wish to inflame an already volatile situation: 'We have never before or after the decision put any oil on the fire.' And given that civil airliner manufacturing is a duopoly scrapping for each of the expected 600 orders this year, a degree of zero-sum spatting is to be expected. But Forgeard's claim is frankly disingenuous. </p> <p>Everything about him seems calculated as a wind-up. Part of this he cannot help - his background, for example. Instead of hard-bitten entrepreneurialism, it reeks of effete elitism. After leaving the Ecole Polytechnique - the academy for high-flying French engineers - he luxuriated in the soft fluff of gallic corporatism, first at the industry ministry, then at steel giant Usinor. He then served time as a political adviser to the French Prime Minister before joining private missile maker Matra, where he worked for Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re, a mentor who would be instrumental in restructuring European aerospace, forming Eads with the Germans and the Spanish and helping Forgeard to the top Airbus job. </p> <p>Forgeard is diminutive, unlike the big brash boys who in the main run US aero space, and clearly enjoys understatement, self deprecation and mischief. Rather than lobbing intercontinental ballistic insults of the 'cheese-eating surrender monkeys' variety across the Atlantic, he prefers the droll kind of quip that a certain kind of American might only realise was an insult after he had left the room. </p> <p>Ahead of a Forgeard briefing at company HQ in Toulouse last week, one former Boeing executive forecast - accurately - that it would be crammed with the kind of one liners that 'drive them up the wall' in Seattle and Chicago, Boeing's home town and HQ, respectively. </p> <p>Forgeard ridicules US action against the EU on refundable state 'launch aid', which has seen Boeing demand the scrapping of a 1992 bilateral agreement setting limits on subsidies in both Europe and the US. He is even more scathing about the US's decision to take the EU to the World Trade Organisation over the subsidies, which immediately led to an EU counter-action. </p> <p>It has been called the worst dispute in the WTO's history. Serious stuff, for sure. Not according to Monsieur F. ' It is a very funny story,' he insists. 'We are strictly compliant with the 1992 agreement - and the Americans know this perfectly.' </p> <p>But surely there must be a case? The expressive brows knit, and his voice dives to a timbre that suggests nothing could be so ridiculous. 'I think it is helpful in the context of today for someone to have a case in the WTO with the bloody Europeans. But there are no facts, of course.' </p> <p>So what is the dispute about? Forgeard's face breaks into a grin that can only be described as an infectious weapon. He mentions a certain date in November of importance to US voters (he is speaking the day after John Kerry and George Bush's last televised debate, when they sought to make capital out of the trade war). </p> <p>But although Forgeard sees the funny side, he also foresees damaging consequences from the dispute. Component suppliers on both sides of the Atlantic would become 'collateral victims', he says, shamelessly deploying an Americanism. And the first, he reckons, is that other stalwart of US aerospace, General Electric, which last week lost the contract to power 50 of Boeing's proposed 7E7 aircraft to Rolls-Royce. Why? Forgeard reckons that because the Japanese are fearful of being dragged into the WTO battle - Tokyo provides subsidies to Japanese manufacturers, who are building up to 30 per cent of the 7E7 - it decided not to choose a US supplier. </p> <p>'The only company that cannot be a victim of anything is us,' he says gleefully. By the time either the 1992 agreement (which limits European launch aid to 30 per cent of development costs, and US subsidies to 3 per cent of industry turnover) is scrapped or subsidies ruled illegal, the major project requiring subsidy, the $12 billion double-decker A380, will have received its launch aid and be in production. </p> <p>The next critical project, a proposed long-range version of its wide-bodied A330-200 - slated for the A350 title - to take on the 7E7, can be financed without launch aid, he claims, observing that Boeing has applied for some $5bn of subsidies for its plane, which could be at risk. Rubbing salt into the wounds, he concludes: 'If tomorrow [the] 1992 [agreement] was cancelled and replaced with nothing, Boeing would lose $600 million of ebit [earnings before interest and tax] and we would lose $350m.' </p> <p>The \u00a32-3bn A350 may be financeable from Airbus cashflow, but if subsidies are available, they will be sought if the plane is developed. 'We will obviously apply for refundable loans,' he says, talking of a figure between $700m and $1bn. </p> <p>Meanwhile, he can't resist a side-swipe at All Nippon Airlines' order for 50 7E7s as 'political', dictated by Japanese manufacturers. Even China, a market every industrialist is sounding out, gives Forgeard an opportunity. He was expected to return from a recent trip there with up to 10 orders for A380s - for which there are currently 129 firm commitments from airlines. He did not, but 'is not at all worried'. This is because, he hints, an agreement with one of China's three airlines for six planes has been reached, but has been held up by politics. </p> <p>Not entirely Chinese politics, either. He claims Airbus has secured 50 orders for planes from the Chinese this year, while Boeing has only nine. 'Maybe - this is just a guess - the authorities there thought that in the month before a major milestone in American political life it would be a little bit much to make an additional order to the Europeans.' </p> <p>By now you can almost hear lawyers straining at the leash in Seattle. But Forgeard's record indicates that he would be a redoubtable foe in any face-off with Harry Stonecipher, his bull-like and famously short-fused opposite number at Boeing. </p> <p>His rise to the top in Europe indicates a shrewd political head. As an industrialist he is respected for his knowledge of detail. Colleagues recount how, shortly after his elevation to the top job in 1998, he intervened in a highly technical complaint made by an airline that turned out to involve defective steelwork in undercarriage assemblies. </p> <p>As an aside Forgeard mentions that Airbus, which has outsold Boeing in four of the past five years, aims to deliver between 315 and 320 planes this year. His sums imply an increase of up to 350 next year and more than 400 for 2006. This leaves Boeing forecasts of 280 this year and 300 next looking anaemic. </p> <p>As for Stonecipher, how do they get on? 'The answer is very well. Of course, we can't speak to each other without witnesses. He is a great character in the industry, and so we get on very well.' </p> <p>Apropos of nothing he adds: 'I am very confident that Harry will restore ethic to Boeing' - just in case anyone had forgotten last year's scandal over a contract for 100 air refuelling tankers that led to the resignation of his predecessor Phil Condit. Finally, he pays tribute to Stonecipher: 'I happened to meet him at the Conquistadors meeting in Wyoming [the annual get together of aerospace top brass, held earlier this autumn]. I think he obviously wants to renegotiate 1992. But I don't think he wanted a WTO case.' </p> <p>The message? Who knows. But it could be read either that Stonecipher is more reasonable than he has been portrayed, or that US politicians are running the process and he is not in control. </p> <p>Whichever, the smile that accompanies his words is that of a cat who has polished off the cream.

  "<p>We commented here yesterday on China Wonder - an example of the eastern frenzy gripping small company speculators in London. But while China as an investment growth story is so clearly in the news, it would be wrong to ignore the sub-continent, another area where investors' expectations are perhaps getting somewhat ahead of reality. </p> <p>Take Asia Energy, a company floated on AIM in April with a view to conducting \"feasibility studies on coal resources within the republic of Bangladesh\". </p> <p>Fringe broker W H Ireland raised \u00a311.2m at 72p a share, giving an initial total market capitalisation of \u00a325m. </p> <p>The stock sat just above the placing price until last month, when the company suddenly announced the discovery of a \"world-class black bituminous coal seam 41.47 metres in thickness\". </p> <p>A follow up statement declared: \"Based on a 15m-tonne per annum coal operation, the cash-flow analyses ... indicate an average ungeared, post-tax project net present value (NPV) of $2.3bn using a discount rate of 10% and an average internal rate of return (IRR) of 50%.

Most of the evidence, from industrial output to the oil price and uncertainties over the presidential election, suggests that the economy may be running out of steam. </p> <p>But the core of the bear case is not the slower-than-expected pace in the increase in US interest rates which would cut yields on dollar denominated assets. Put crudely it is the belief that at some point foreign investors will simply lose their appetite for funding the trade gap and stop buying dollar assets. No one quite knows when it might happen but the bears are convinced it will. So if foreign investors give up on dollar assets what will they buy instead? The yen hardly looks attractive. Foreign exchange speculators have plenty of relatively recent experience about what the Bank of Japan is prepared to do to keep the currency at a level which encourages the country's exporters. </p> <p>Sterling would hardly be the market's darling in a dollar bloodbath as both the trade balance and the government deficit are beginning to acquire a distinctly American twang.

  "The scratchy black and white video that formed the crux of the Zimbabwe government's case against the leader of its main opposition was of such poor quality that it was difficult to be sure of the identities of the four men sitting around a table in a Canadian office. <p>The sound was so muffled that the tape was replayed in court six times before anyone could agree on what was actually said. </p> <p>One man, identified as Canadian-Israeli Ari Ben Menashe, could be deciphered repeatedly talking about \"eliminating\" the Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe. </p> <p>The black man in the frame, identified as Morgan Tsvangirai, eventually responded: \"OK, now Mugabe is eliminated. We proceed with constitutional elections.\" </p> <p>It was with those words that Mr Tsvangirai consigned himself to a two and a half year legal battle which culminated in a treason trial for his life. With yesterday's not guilty verdict, Mr Tsvangirai was off the hook, for now. </p> <p>But while the charges hung over the head of the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, the crisis in Zimbabwe worsened. </p> <p>Basic rights such as freedom of speech and assembly have been curtailed. Three newspapers have been closed. Torture by police and other state agents has continued. The economy has plummetted and more people are starving. </p> <p>According to those who have followed Mr Tsvangirai's predicament, the tortuous legal process has played into 80-year-old Mr Mugabe's hands. The trial sapped the opposition leader and his party of funds and energy. Mr Tsvangirai was in effect hobbled. A guilty verdict was of secondary importance to Mr Mugabe, according to legal specialists. </p> <p>In fact, said John Makumbe, political science lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe, the Mugabe government had calculated that a guilty verdict for Mr Tsvangirai would bring more international criticism and pressure than it was worth. \"The case was essentially political harassment and the government achieved its aim of hamstringing Tsvangirai and his party. The case substantially reduced the capacity of the MDC,\" he said. </p> <p>Supporters of Mr Tsvangirai point to the background of the key prosecuting witness, Mr Ben Menashe, 52 , a former Israeli intelligence agent. Evidence in the trial showed he had received $650,000 from the Zimbabwean intelligence service and was accused of frequently lying under oath in an effort to cover up those links. </p> <p>Mr Makumbe said that with the acquittal \"the Mugabe regime is just trying to cleanse its image. It needed to project itself as a legitimate regime. I would say we may be seeing the effect of pressure from the international community, particularly from other African states. </p> <p>\"All the reports to the African Union and the European Union about human rights abuses and the breakdown of the rule of law are paying off. The government is responding to this pressure.\" </p> <p>Mr Mugabe's spokesman, George Charamba, refused to comment. </p> <p>Other supporters of the president's Zanu-PF party said Mr Tsvangirai's acquittal proved that an independent judicial system was still alive in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>But legal experts, both inside and outside the country, dispute this. </p> <p>\"This has been a politically tainted trial from the beginning,\" exiled Zimbabwean judge Michael Majuru said. \"The acquittal does not hide the fact that this case never should have come to trial. The judge should have thrown out the charges from the beginning. There was no case to answer.\" </p> <p>Mr Majuru, who fled Zimbabwe earlier this year after being threatened by the minister of justice, said: \"The bottom line is that no one could ever say that there was enough evidence to convict. Much more than this verdict is needed to repair the integrity of Zimbabwe's judicial system. The entire system is sullied and operates as an appendage of the ruling party.\" </p> <p>Though Mr Tsvangirai still faces a second treason trial, he must also work towards running an effective campaign in the forthcoming parliamentary elections. </p> <p>The MDC earlier suspended its participation in the elections, set for next March, but the party appears to be rethinking its boycott. </p> <p>Mr Makumbe warned that Mr Tsvangirai's acquittal was a tactical retreat before the Mugabe government launches a new offensive. </p> <p>\"They are sharpening their claws for the next kill. Tsvangirai must face another treason trial under the Public Order and Security Act. Even though the charge is very flimsy, another court case will continue to weaken his ability to function as a forceful opposition leader.\" </p> <p>The Mugabe government this month introduced legislation to outlaw human rights work by non-governmental organisations and to restrict the press further. </p> <p>\"The government is tightening its grip because it wants to get a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections in March,\" said Mr Makumbe.</p>",

  "<p>Russian oil major Yukos is expected to face the auction of its main subsidiary by the end of the month at a price far lower than its estimated worth, a move analysts say could ruin the company and destroy the equity of minority shareholders. </p> <p>Unnamed government sources told Russian news agency Interfax that 76.8% of Yukos's core operating unit, Yuganskneftegaz, would be auctioned at a starting price of $4bn some time before the end of October. The price is based on the unit's valuation of $10.4bn, announced by the justice ministry this week, plus a 60% discount to compensate for the fact that the government will still hold a minority stake - a reduction analysts have called ridiculous. </p> <p>Investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, which was hired to value Yugansk, is said to have put the company's worth at between $14.7bn-$17.3bn. Although it acknowledged the $10.4bn valuation, it called that number \"overly conservative\". Yukos chairman Viktor Gerashchenko has been quoted in Russian media as saying the unit could be worth up to $30bn. The news sent Yukos shares down again yesterday, falling 8.9% in the first 10 minutes of trade on the Moscow interbank currency exchange. Shares finished down 7.61%. </p> <p>The company, whose former chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, has been in jail for over a year and is now on trial on charges of tax evasion and fraud, is facing a bill of $8bn in back taxes dating to 2000. This two-pronged attack is believed by many to be politically motivated. </p> <p>Yuganskneftegaz is to be auctioned through the Russian Federal Property Fund to pay that debt, despite company protests that the government is required by federal law to look at other, less-important assets first to settle tax claims. </p> <p>\"Clearly Yuganskneftegaz is the core asset of Yukos and there are numerous other alternatives available to raise cash to cover the liabilities assessed by the courts,\" said Steven Theede, Yukos's chief executive, in a statement calling the $10.4bn valuation \"troubling\". </p> <p>\"It's not available to Russia to pick off the jewel in Yukos's crown,\" said Robert Amsterdam, the Canadian lawyer who is part of the international defence team for Mr Khodorkovsky. </p> <p>Mr Amsterdam said a state-controlled oil and gas company was almost certain to be involved if Yuganskneftegaz was to be auctioned off at so low a price. </p> <p>\"At least now the motive for the attack on Khodorkovsky is clear: it wasn't just a political attack, it was an economic attack,\" Mr Amsterdam said. \"This isn't bargain basement; this is theft. </p> <p>\"It's breathtaking for a state to engage in conduct like this,\" he added </p> <p>It is not clear whether the $4bn sales tag is certain. Vladimir Zeletsov, a Federal Property Fund spokesman, said yesterday that no information had been released. </p> <p>Yukos is facing new challenges almost daily. A court order prevents Yukos from selling assets to pay its tax bill; the company was forced to cut production by a further 30,000 barrels per day, which takes effect from today, after a Siberian utility threatened to cut Yugansk's power supply over outstanding bills. The unit pumps 60m barrels per day, or more than 60% of Yukos's output. </p> <p>Big Russian oil companies, including Lukoil, Sibneft, Rosneft, Gazprom and TNK-BP, have said publicly they are not planning to bid for Yugansk. Nevertheless analysts expect a subsidiary of state-controlled Gazprom is likely to obtain the unit. </p> <p>Analysts have called news of the auction the \"worst possible scenario\" for Yukos, and a \"confiscatory nationalisation\" of its property. </p> <p>In a note to investors on Friday, the Troika Dialog brokerage said: \"It was already clear that the Kremlin could bankrupt a debt-free oil company at a time when crude was fetching record high prices if it so wished. The indication now is that it will.\" </p> <p>An auction at $4bn would prevent the company from paying bills still pending for 2002 and 2003, estimated to be as high as an additional $6bn. </p> <p>United Financial Group wrote in a note to investors that a series of anonymous, official press briefings this week \"leave no doubt\" about Yukos's fate. </p> <p>\"What does this plan spell for Yukos? The answer is: total destruction of its equity and also, to judge by the hints, nationalisation of its key assets. Second: can the plan succeed? Our view: most likely, it can,\" wrote the brokerage. </p> <p>However, UFG joint head of research Christopher Granville said as long as Yukos remains an isolated case, he expects the Russian market to absorb the news. </p> <p>\"The market is moving much less on this news now than it was a year ago,\" he said. \"I think this is a reaction to the challenge that was perceived from Khodorkovsky and this is collateral damage. I can't see any evidence this is a proactive policy ... The Yukos affair has been going on for 16 months now, so they have had plenty of time to move on to phases two and three.\"</p>",
  "The entire 14,000-strong police force of an Argentinian city has been ordered to undergo compulsory DNA testing in a case of suspected serial rape. <p>The move in Cordoba, Argentina's second city, follows a claim by one of the rapist's 32 victims that she was attacked by a police officer. </p> <p>\"If a man who we pay to protect the lives of citizens is out there raping young women on the street he should get a life sentence,\" said Jos\u00e9 de la Sota, governor of Cordoba. </p> <p>\"The best thing we can do, to clear any doubts, is to submit the entire police force to DNA testing.\" </p> <p>Collection of blood samples has already begun in a huge operation being conducted by private and state medical institutions. It is estimated that it will take about six months to gather all the samples and perform the DNA tests. </p> <p>Officers who refuse to be tested may be expelled from the force and turned over to the court investigating the rape cases, the authorities said. Some 2,000 women members of the Cordoba police force will be tested as well. The cost is estimated at about $750,000. </p> <p>\"The idea is to create a digitalised DNA bank of all police members and prison wardens so that, should new cases appear tomorrow in which our officers are suspected, we can quickly compare the evidence with the genetic patterns we have gathered,\" said Carlos Alesandri, the security minister. </p> <p>\"I'm convinced that the supreme aim is to defend the force,\" said Jorge Rodriguez, the Cordoba police chief, as he became the first officer to submit a blood sample. </p> <p>But legal experts and civil liberties activists have protested that the DNA order is unconstitutional and that only the court investigating the rapes is empowered to demand DNA testing. </p> <p>A geneticist, Marcelo Simonetta, said the tests would be legally invalid unless a special law was drafted. Ricardo Moreno, a lawyer, agreed. \"This is unconstitutional - there could be a flood of lawsuits against the government.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the murky world of music merchandising, anything is possible. Bands have endeavoured to sell us many things in their name, from foodstuffs and lunchboxes to credit cards and cheap watches. </p> <p>But it's the T-shirt, as old as rock'n'roll itself, that remains the quintessential display of sonic loyalty. The short-sleeved statement of intent and popular music could almost have been invented for each other, and this month online retailer <a href=\"http://www.recordstore.co.uk/teeshirtstore/\">www.teeshirtstore.co.uk</a> is conducting a poll to establish the most beloved and despised music T-shirts of all time.</p> <p>But while T-shirts remain popular, interpreting the intent and inclination of the wearer is more complicated than ever.

You could make friends and identify enemies via band T-shirts. </p> <p>Inevitably, for the youth of today, things are infinitely more confused. The notional loyalty of T-shirts has been abstracted out of all recognition by stylists and celebrities, and now nothing is certain. When Madonna performed in a Kylie T-shirt you could almost sense the whole nation clasping its hands together in ironic delight but, in fact, it was the end of an era.</p> <p>Now, when you see shots of David Beckham putting out his bins in a Mot\u00f6rhead T-shirt you don't think, \"Oh, should we ever meet up I'll ask him whether he prefers Overkill or Bomber.\" You wonder if he even knows they're a band. When a musician wears another band's T-shirt they are either saying, \"Behold my elaborate web of influence!\" and/or \"Gawp at my ironic sideswipes at popular culture!\"</p> <p>In truth, all sartorial statements now have scaled-down consequences. It is much harder to get beaten up simply because of your clothes than it once was, and that probably has to be progress. Even wearing a football shirt is permissible in rival towns and only Burberry check appears to ruffle any feathers. </p> <p>Which is a bit of a shame. In the mid-1980s, if you saw someone in a voluminous Wham! \"Choose Life\" or \"Frankie Says...\" you knew their loftiest ambition was to stand within touching distance of Gary Davies on Top Of The Pops and you could judge them accordingly. I recall seeing someone in a T-shirt made by art rockers the Pop Group which featured Margaret Thatcher and the slogan \"We are all prostitutes \" and thinking it the most courageous thing I'd ever seen. Well, I didn't get out much.</p> <p>Adolescent prejudice and nostalgia apart, the shift in T-shirt values from demonstration of loyalty to a mere gesture of sly sartorial intent is a lamentable thing. Not for the bands, who can sell even more, but more for those of us who enjoy judging people by their appearance, and might otherwise not notice each other at all.</p>",
  "There will soon be much talk about women bishops in the Church of England. The official Rochester Report, to be published on November 2, will be discussed in General Synod in February along with motions from diocesan synods requesting that legislation be prepared for the consecration of women bishops now. Most churchgoers favour women bishops. The question is not if, but when and how, we have them. <p>We know the how is important because the leaked Rochester Report reveals it suggesting seven possibilities, ranging from not having women bishops, to caps on female episcopal authority, to further extended oversight for opponents, to a single clause measure for women bishops. I favour the latter as do most people, judging from the Church Times' letters page, quite simply because women, like men, have the gifts required, and appointments should be made on the basis of gifts. This is how the early church operated, and so should we. The testimony of women and men, those who have been bishops as well as those who have experienced both women and men in that office, is that the Holy Spirit is working in individual's and church community's lives, to call women to the episcopate. </p> <p>This is an issue for the whole Anglican Communion, partly because not all provinces yet have women bishops but also because it relates to church order, which is at present in disarray. On Monday, Archbishop Eames' commission will produce its report on how the Anglican Communion might hang together. The question is: what are we to do if people do not like a bishop, because of factors such as gender or sexuality, and seek alternative oversight? For it is when an alternative bishop's oversight is sought that disorder ensues. That is why Augustine came down heavily on the Donatists seeking their own \"pure\" bishops, in the fourth and fifth centuries. </p> <p>Most people became aware of this dilemma when Gene Robinson, a gay man, was elected bishop of New Hampshire. A few parts of the Episcopal Church have shipped in alternative bishops if their bishop supported Robinson. Bishops are crossing each other's territories in unprecedented ways and not always with pastoral sensitivity. This is all related to my point that it is not if we consecrate women as bishops, but how . </p> <p>For it was the Church of England's Act of Synod that opened up this particular can of worms. When the General Synod in 1992 voted for women priests, it did so by a two-thirds majority in each house, and legislation amply provided for those opposed to women priests. Many opponents, who could not accept that the church had lawfully made the decision, pressed for more concessions, resulting in the Act of Synod and flying bishops. </p> <p>Those of us who think we should simply have women bishops without any institutionalised alternative oversight provisions have been accused by the Suffragan Bishop of Fulham of Stalinist thought-control. He has missed the point. We do not wish to stop others believing what they believe, but rather we are calling on the church to represent in its workings the orthodox doctrine that men and women are created equally in the image and likeness of God, and we wish to address the problem of church order that is troubling the whole Anglican Communion. This involves a creative and sensitive approach. </p> <p>We need to listen to the experiences of female bishops from other parts of the Anglican Communion (which the Rochester Report did not). In the US, where flying bishops have been resisted, Geralyn Wolf, Bishop of Rhode Island, worked with the vicars in parishes where there was opposition to women bishops to agree the ministry of a visiting male bishop, and to ensure that she is invited every 18 months to officiate at a non-eucharistic service. How much truer this is to our Catholic tradition than the muddle of flying bishops. How much truer it is to the gospel of love, co-operation, justice and peace than division, discord, and name-calling.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Rev Dr Jane Shaw is dean of divinity, chaplain and fellow of New College, Oxford. The Call for Women Bishops edited by Harriet Harris and Jane Shaw will be published by SPCK next week.</p>",
  "After three years, \u00a360,000 in legal fees and the intervention of an animal behaviourist, in the end it was a 12-minute video that saved Dino the dog yesterday. <p>Judge Patrick Eccles QC, lifted a death sentence that had been hanging over Dino since an unfortunate incident in 2001 when he bit a woman in a park after a confrontation with her terrier Ralph. The video suggested that the alsatian was a reformed character. </p> <p>His owner, Bryan Lamont - who turned to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in his fight to save his pet from a lethal injection under the Dangerous Dogs Act - sat with a team of animal experts behind him at Northampton crown court as his lawyers fought for a permanent reprieve. </p> <p>In the end, none of them was needed. The short film, made by an animal behaviourist, showed Dino frolicking peacefully with canine pals and was enough to persuade the judge that the dog was more pussy cat than public threat. </p> <p>Judge Eccles was moved to quote Hamlet: \"'Every dog will have his day,' said the Bard, and Mr Lamont's devotion has allowed Dino to have his day.\" He added: \"If a Scotsman with deep pockets and spirit takes on the judiciary to vindicate his dog, the contest is likely to be vigorous and prolonged.\" </p> <p>Dino, aged seven, was not in court to hear his death sentence lifted. He was where every dog should be while the master is out - guarding the homestead in East Hunsbury, Northampton. The Lamont house is evidence itself of the long and vigorous battle to save Dino's life since he was put under a destruction order for biting Elizabeth Coull, who had tried to intervene between him and her terrier. </p> <p>As well as exhausting all avenues in the courts - including the House of Lords and the European court of human rights - Mr Lamont and his wife, Carol, have been determined over the past three years to show that Dino is not a threat to anyone. They built 6ft fences around their home, used padlocks on the gates to ensure Dino could not escape and took him for walks wearing a muzzle. </p> <p>They engaged animal behaviourists to assess Dino and finally turned to the group responsible for sending potential miscarriages of justice to the appeal court. </p> <p>In testimony to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, Roger Mugford, an animal behaviourist, said: \"We think a death sentence is a bit extreme. The dog is now substantially reformed. He has passed those teenage years.\" </p> <p>As a result, the commission concluded there was \"a real possibility that the destruction order ... would not be upheld if it were referred\", and it sent Mr Lamont's conviction, forallowing Dino to be out of control in a public place, back to Northampton crown court. </p> <p>Mr Lamont said later that he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the reprieve. </p> <p>The first thing he did was phone his wife, who was at home with Dino, waiting for news. </p> <p>\"She's absolutely over the moon,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>It seemed too good a bargain to miss, a spanking new Bugaboo baby buggy, the favourite of fashion-conscious parents, for less than half the normal price. </p> <p>Yusuf Hatia and his wife Sarah Taylor, who are expecting their first child, were among the many who spotted the offer on the internet auction site eBay and dashed off an email expressing their interest. </p> <p>But, of course, as the consumer experts are always at pains to stress, if it seems like too good a bargain to be true, it probably is. </p> <p>Mr Hatia, a 32-year-old marketing consultant, and Ms Taylor, 30, a teacher, were drawn into a simple but clever scam involving fake websites and cod emails. </p> <p>They are not alone. There have been scores of cons in the UK and many hundreds across the world in which eBay bargain hunters have been ripped off. </p> <p>The potential dangers were highlighted this week when it emerged that a teenager from south Wales tricked site users out of \u00a345,000 by promising them electrical goods which turned out not to exist. </p> <p>But the fraud does not stop there. The virtual auction house, beloved of Cherie Blair who used it to buy designer shoes, has become an online flea market for illicit goods ranging from pirate music to antiquities of dubious origins. </p> <p>The company insists it is doing all it can to clamp down on the sale of illegal goods - it told the Guardian that only this week it caught a person who was trying to illicitly trade a very large hoard of coins. </p> <p>But eBay acknowledges that its size - it has 114 million users across the world and 10m items on sale at any one time - makes it difficult to police. </p> <p>Not all are convinced it is doing enough. One expert in pirate DVDs, whose job involves liaising with the company, said: \"On the one hand eBay is willing to cooperate when it is pointed out that something is not right but it does not seem to be very pro-active about nailing the bad guys.\" </p> <p>Mr Hatia's and Ms Taylor's case is a good example of how buyers hoping for a cut-price deal are tempted away from the relative safety of the site. </p> <p>After expressing his interest in the buggy via the site, Mr Hatia, of east London, was contacted directly - not through eBay - by the supposed seller and offered a red Bugaboo \"Frog\" for $550 (\u00a3305). The \"seller\" told him she would hand over the buggy to the carrier, TNT. It would notify Mr Hatia when it had the buggy and he would send the cash to her via the transfer service Western Union and give TNT the payment details. </p> <p>Once TNT had delivered the buggy, he would instruct the carrier to release the payment information so she could collect the money. </p> <p>The trick in such cases is that the real, respectable TNT carrier is not involved at all. Emails purporting to come through TNT come straight from the con artists. The links to sites which are included on the \"seller's\" email are to fake TNT sites created by the fraudsters. The victim is releasing the payment details straight to those behind the deception. </p> <p>Mr Hatia became suspicious and pulled out. As a marketing expert he sees the skill in tempting him with a clever choice of product. Not only is the Bugaboo a la mode, it is increasingly hard to come by. He said: \"I could see many people falling for this kind of trick. It seemed genuine.\" </p> <p>TNT has come across around 40 such cases in the UK, involving a range of goods. The giant American carriers have received many hundreds of complaints. </p> <p>Tony Lugg, TNT's regional security manager for Europe, said it was working hard to stop the scam, reporting incidents to the Metropolitan police's hi-tech crime unit and the international Internet Fraud Centre. It takes down the fake sites and registers all the possible site names including TNT which it can think of to stop fraudsters getting control of them. </p> <p>But he said eBay could do more to flag up the hazards of dealing \"off site\" and making money transfers through the likes of Western Union. </p> <p>While TNT worries about the Bugaboo scam, Roger Bland, head of treasure and portable antiquities at the British Museum, is becoming more concerned about the relics which are on sale on eBay. </p> <p>Mr Bland said the site is the biggest vehicle for people selling hoards of coins and other treasures. The suspicion is that many of the deals are illegal. </p> <p>When concerns are raised with eBay, Mr Bland claimed it refused to take action unless it could be conclusively proved the objects had been illegitimately obtained, which is very difficult. </p> <p>John Giacobbi, managing director of Web Sheriff, which patrols the internet for illegal music recordings on behalf of record companies, said eBay was pre pared to get items removed when they were pointed out to them but added: \"They don't, from what we can see, proactively police things.\" </p> <p>Garreth Griffith, head of safety for eBay in the UK, said only 0.01% of the transactions carried out on the site could be confirmed as fraud. </p> <p>He had not come across the TNT scam but pointed out there were warnings on eBay about the dangers of trading off-site and sending money by electronic transfer. </p> <p>Mr Griffith said 1,000 people around the world worked on security issues for eBay. Hi- and low-tech innovations were continually being introduced to make fraud more difficult. </p> <p>But the bottom line for the company is that buyers in the virtual world should use the same common sense they would use in an East End street market.</p> <p><strong>How eBay made net profit</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> eBay was launched in the US in September 1995 after a conversation between Pierre Omidyar and his wife, who told her husband it would be great if she were able to collect sweet dispensers and talk with other collectors over the internet </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> eBay came to the UK in 1999 and had a slow start. In 2001 there were 350 items for sale on the site at any one time; in the first three months of 2002 there were 5.6m items </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> eBay created a new market of one-to-one trading in an auction format on the web and is the world's largest personal online trading community </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> There are more than 42 million registered users </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Users buy and sell items in more than 9,000 categories worldwide, including collectables, antiques, sports memorabilia, computers, toys, beanie babies, dolls, figures, coins, stamps, books, magazines, music, pottery, glass, photography, electronics, jewellery and gemstones </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> There are more than 10m auctions every day, with more than 1m new items joining the for sale list every 24 hours </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> On the UK site a car is sold every four minutes, a teddy bear every two minutes and an item of women's clothing every 20 seconds </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> eBay began its first advertising campaign in the UK this month to celebrate its fifth birthday</p>",
  "US soldiers have far greater trust in President George Bush as commander-in-chief than in John Kerry, preferring the incumbent by a nearly three-to-one margin, a poll showed yesterday. <p>The University of Pennsylvania's National Annenberg Election Survey, which contacted 655 members of the US military on active duty and their families, revealed far stronger support for the Bush administration than among the civilian population - even among Republican civilians.</p> <p>Troops were far more positive about the war in Iraq and the economy - attitudes that could tip the vote in several key states. Florida, for example, has more than 150,000 registered voters in the military, and US soldiers tend to vote in far greater numbers than civilians.</p> <p>Sixty-nine per cent of the country's 2.3 million active-duty troops and reservists voted in the 2000 elections - compared with an overall turnout rate of 51% - and all indications point to an even higher rate next month.</p> <p>Ninety-four per cent of the troops in the Annenberg sample said they intended to vote. The survey, conducted around the time of the first Bush-Kerry debate, which gave the challenger a boost, did not directly ask soldiers their voting preferences, which is illegal.</p> <p>However, the troops made it clear they preferred Mr Bush. Some 69% saw him as a better commander-in-chief than Mr Kerry, who was backed by 24% of those polled. Mr Bush also scored better among civilians in a companion Annenberg poll, but only by 50% to 41%.</p> <p>Although Mr Kerry scored for his military record, with 40% seeing the experience as an important qualification for president, the troops were far less forgiving about his efforts to stop the Vietnam war following his return from duty, with 76% voicing disapproval.</p> <p>Some 64% of the military said it had been worth going to war in Iraq, while 32% disagreed. However, that support fell to 55% among those soldiers who had actually served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Among civilians, only 45% of those polled believed that the war had been worth it.</p> <p>The troops also appeared to have accepted Mr Bush's justi fications for going to war. Nearly twice as many said the war was fought to remove Saddam Hussein (29%) as said it was to remove the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction (15%). Eleven per cent said it was a war for oil.</p> <p>The soldiers were divided on whether the war had made America safer, with 47% saying it had, and 42% saying it had increased the risk of a terrorist attack. However, many acknowledged that America's standing had fallen in the world, with 42% saying the US had become more unpopular under the Bush presidency.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Pentagon plans to promote General Ricardo Sanchez, who was in charge of jails in Iraq at the time of the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal, if Mr Bush is re-elected, the Los Angeles Times reported yesterday. It said the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, was seeking to give a fourth star to Gen Sanchez, chief of military operations in Iraq, who has been criticised for failing to check the rise of violence in the country and lack of oversight of detention facilities.</p>",
  "British and South African police have smashed what they think was a major international smuggling ring responsible for stealing \u00a317m worth of precious metals. <p>More than 400 officers from the UK's National Crime Squad, South Africa's elite special investigations unit, the Scorpions, and South African police, were involved in simultaneous raids yesterday in South Africa and England. </p> <p>Detectives believe gold, silver, platinum, palladium and rhodium were hijacked from South African mines, illegally exported to the UK as scrap metal with bogus invoices, refined in a Cambridgeshire refinery and sold on to legitimate companies to manufacture jewellery and other goods. </p> <p>The proceeds were then allegedly laundered into off-shore accounts and channelled into funding crime in South Africa, including further theft of precious metals. </p> <p>The owner of the Cambridgeshire refinery, a British resident of South African descent who owns several UK businesses, was arrested in South Africa. The National Crime Squad, which also raided business premises in Radlett, Hertfordshire, Cin derford, Gloucestershire, and a storage facility at Heathrow airport, had been gathering details on UK metal imports for some time. </p> <p>Twelve other people were arrested in South Africa on suspicion of money laundering and racketeering. The latter offence carries a maximum sentence of 30 years there. </p> <p>Police think the syndicate had access to refineries and mines and bribed South African law and customs officials. </p> <p>Detective Inspector Paul Fulwood, of the National Crime Squad, said: \"We're delighted to have assisted our South African colleagues in disrupting this sophisticated organised crime group.\" </p> <p>Gerhard Nel, head of the Scorpions in South Africa's Gauteng region, said the investigation, codenamed Operation Clown, had been a coup. </p> <p>\"We think we have arrested some major players,\" he said. \"We estimate this was worth 200m rand (\u00a317m) but it could have been more.\" </p> <p>The platinum group metals, which occur together in nature, can be used in products from aircraft turbines to mobile phones, catalytic converters and fountain pens. </p> <p>South Africa is the world's leading platinum producer and the second-largest producer of palladium, after Russia.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Saturday October 16</strong></p> <p><strong>The Importance Of Being Earnest</strong> (Anthony Asquith, 1952)<br> 2.55pm, BBC2</p> <p>Asquith seems handbagged by the sparkle and wit of Wilde's glorious comedy: he simply points the cameras and lets the actors get on with it. Wonderful acting, though, from Michael Redgrave, Michael Denison and most emphatically Edith Evans as Lady Bracknell.</p> <p><strong>Bill And Ted's Excellent Adventure</strong> (Stephen Herek, 1988)<br> 3.25pm, ITV1</p> <p>These forerunners of Wayne's World duo Wayne and Garth were a superior comic double act, but not half as successful: it's a funny old world. Teenagers Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) dream of forming a heavy metal band, but first Ted must pass his history exam. So the pair hop into a time-travelling phone booth and start collecting historical characters from down the ages - Joan of Arc, Billy The Kid, Socrates, and most entertainingly, Terry Camilleri's Napoleon.</p> <p><strong>The Belles Of St Trinian's</strong> (Frank Launder, 1954)<br> 4.30pm, C4</p> <p>First and best of the screen adventures of Ronald Searle's anarchic cartoon schoolgels, who dress in gymslips, carry jolly hockey-sticks, and take A-levels in GBH. A gloriously gaudy farce, with an Alpha-plus cast: lugubrious Alastair Sim, George Cole and Joyce Grenfell.</p> <p><strong>Wilde</strong> (Brian Gilbert, 1996)<br> 10.10pm, BBC2</p> <p>Absorbing, Julian Mitchell- scripted account of Oscar Wilde's relationship with Lord Alfred \"Bosie \" Douglas ((Jude Law) and his subsequent imprisonment. Stephen Fry in the title role physically resembles Wilde and portrays the generous warmth behind the acute wit with touching pathos. Tom Wilkinson plays the stern face of the establishment, the Marquess of Queensberry, whom Wilde misguidedly sued for libel.</p> <p><strong>The Cell</strong> (Tarsem Singh, 2000)<br> 10.15pm, C4</p> <p>A standard serial-killer thriller, filtered intriguingly through an acid dream. Jennifer Lopez stars as a psychologist who delves literally into the lurid, nightmare mind of murderer Vincent D'Onofrio in an attempt to save his next victim (Tara Subkoff): and it's a place you really don't want to go. Wild stuff, with genuinely jolting imagery crafted by video star Tarsem Singh in an ambitious and effective big- screen debut.</p> <p><strong>Beverly Hills Cop</strong> (Martin Brest, 1984)<br> 11.30pm, ITV1</p> <p>Eddie Murphy has a high old time in the tailor-made role of loud and tough Detroit cop Axel Foley. As a black exponent of ear-achingly bad language investigating a friend's death in white, wealthy Beverly Hills, he antagonises local villains and cops alike. Steven Berkoff is the oily, art-dealing villain, Judge Reinhold a lone friend in the LAPD.</p> <p><strong>A Man Of No Importance</strong> (Suri Krishnamma, 1994)<br> 12.05am, BBC2</p> <p>More Wildean business: a bravura performance from Albert Finney as poetry-reciting Dublin bus conductor Alfie Byrne, who is stirred by beautiful passenger Adele (Tara Fitzgerald) to stage Oscar Wilde's Salome at the local church hall. A bold plan that meets with any number of impediments - among them Michael Gambon's butcher Carney, a grudging Herod - while Alfie struggles with a rather despairing, repressed homosexual lovelife. Set evocatively in the 1960s.</p> <p><strong>The Dead</strong> (John Huston, 1987)<br> 3.05am, C4</p> <p>Huston's last film is a near-perfect adaptation of a James Joyce meditation on love and life. It's set in Dublin, around the annual party given by a pair of elderly, fluttery spinsters (Helena Carroll, Cathleen Delany), where a song awakens in Anjelica Huston's Greta the long dormant memory of a fatal love.</p> <p><strong>Sunday October 17</strong></p> <p><strong>Will Penny</strong> (Tom Gries, 1967)<br> 3.40pm, Five</p> <p>Charlton Heston stars as lonesome cowboy Will Penny, weary of life on the trail but scared of settling down when good woman Joan Hackett crosses his path. There's also the little problem of crazy Quint (Donald Pleasence) and his deeply unpleasant sons. This is no conventional shoot-em-up western; Gries is more interested in Penny's hard, nomadic existence.</p> <p><strong>The Battle Of Midway</strong> (Jack Smight, 1942)<br> 4pm, ITV1</p> <p>All-star recreation of one of the second world war's decisive battles, when the US Navy defeated the Japanese fleet in the Pacific, in June 1942. Clarifying the tactics of such an enormous sea conflict defeats Smight, and there's a feeble love story involving a navy boy and a Japanese girl; but authentic war footage helps convey the scale of it. With Henry Fonda, Charlton Heston and James Coburn.</p> <p><strong>Practical Magic</strong> (Griffin Dunne, 1998)<br> 8pm, Five</p> <p>A little lighthearted witchery: Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock are sisters and descendants of witches and there's an ancient curse that kills off any men unfortunate enough to fall for female members of the family - so Aidan Quinn's lovelorn detective is in deep hubble-bubble trouble. This is plotting of abracadabra simplicity, but it's charming enough.</p> <p><strong>High Heels And Low Lifes</strong> (Mel Smith, 2001)<br> 10. 55pm, BBC1</p> <p>There appear to be noble intentions behind Mel Smith's misfired girly gangster flick: introduce a pair of women (nurse Minnie Driver; actress Mary McCormack) into a Guy Ritchie- style heist movie, ease down on the violence and aim for a gentler comedy befitting the director of Bean. A pity it's a bit of a mess.</p> <p><strong>Monday October 18</strong></p> <p><strong>The Baby And The Battleship</strong> (Jay Lewis, 1956)<br> 1.30pm, C4</p> <p>Those grand old knights of British cinema Richard Attenborough and John Mills had sailed together earlier, in David Lean's directorial debut In Which We Serve, but this is a sadly leaky vessel by comparison. Dickie's Knocker White and Johnny's Puncher Roberts are serving on the HMS Gillingham, and smuggle a baby on board while repairing in Naples.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday October 19</strong></p> <p><strong>Niagara</strong> (Henry Hathaway, 1953)<br> 1.35pm, C4</p> <p>Hathaway uses Niagara Falls here the way Hitchcock used Mount Rushmore in North By Northwest, turning the tourist resort into a colourful, ironic backdrop for black deeds. The camera lingers too on the form of Marilyn Monroe, a floozy who with young stud Richard Allan plots to murder her husband, the disturbed Korean war veteran Joseph Cotten.</p> <p><strong>The Four Hundred Blows</strong> (Francois Truffaut, 1959)<br> 12.15am, BBC2</p> <p>Truffaut's first feature film threw down the gauntlet on behalf of the French new wave. Shot on the cheap on the streets of Paris, it's a semi-autobiographical account of 12-year-old Antoine (Jean-Pierre Leaud), ducking and diving and on the run from home, reform school and everything. A still fresh and vivid picture of childhood.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday October 20</strong></p> <p><strong>The Matrix</strong> (Larry Wachowski, Andy Wachowski, 1999)<br> 9pm, Five</p> <p>This original part of the Wachowski brothers' epic sci--fi trilogy is by far the best: a kinetic thrill-a-minute joy-ride, full of ever so cool flying kung fu and bodies slo-mo swaying around the trajectory of bullets. The brothers' labyrinthine plot, with mankind unknowingly enslaved in a virtual reality induced by a malevolent master race, is reminiscent of Philip K Dick: spouting its mystic- mechanical mumbo-jumbo with huge confidence, it's a perfect blend of form and content, with Keanu Reeves.</p> <p><strong>Last Embrace</strong> (Jonathan Demme, 1979) 11. 35pm, BBC1</p> <p>Genuinely tense Hitchcockian thriller, starring Roy Scheider as an investigator trying to work out why he's on a mysterious hitlist. Close to breakdown after his wife dies in an attack on him, he starts to track the killer, with the help of student Janet Margolin.</p> <p><strong>Shoot The Pianist</strong> (Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, 1960)<br> 12.10am, BBC2</p> <p>Truffaut's second feature, shot in an austere monochrome, is a loving homage to American film noir. Smooth French singer Charles Aznavour proves a bit of a Frank Sinatra as an actor; he's excellent as the melancholy bar- room piano player haunted by the past, while his brothers are stalked by gangsters.</p> <p><strong>Thursday October 21</strong></p> <p><strong>I'm All Right Jack</strong> (John Boulting, 1959)<br> 1.20pm, C4</p> <p>Nostalgia time in the Boulting brothers' sharp and funny attack on big business and the unions - in the days when they wielded real power. Ian Carmichael plays a young twit embroiled by devious Dennis Price and Richard Attenborough in a scheme to spark a strike at the latter's munitions factory - where Peter Sellers reigns as shop steward.</p> <p><strong>The Perfect Storm</strong> (Wolfgang Petersen, 2000)<br> 8pm, Five</p> <p>Adapted from Sebastian Junger's best-selling book, this is the story of the fishing boat Andrea Gail when it was caught, in 1991, in the worst storm ever recorded. The computer-generated ocean waves are stupendous, but Petersen never lets them submerge the defiant courage of the fishermen on board, among them George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg.</p> <p><strong>Jagged Edge</strong> (Richard Marquand, 1985)<br> 10.55pm, C4</p> <p>Taut, twisty thriller sharply scripted by Joe Eszterhas and full of surprises. Top-class performances, too, with Glenn Close a lawyer defending suspected wife-murderer Jeff Bridges: her judgment starts to cloud when they become lovers. Wearily familiar, perhaps - this is the umpteenth TV showing - but it projects a constant sense of menace.</p> <p><strong>The Woman Next Door</strong> (Francois Truffaut, 1981)<br> 12.15am, BBC2</p> <p>A tale of French provincial passion, with bourgeois chap G\u00e9rard Depardieu moving with wife and child to a new town where the newlywed next door, Fanny Ardant, is a former love: soon the couple return to their obsessive affair, with disastrous results. An elegant and suspenseful exploration of illicit love, with convincing performances from the leads.</p> <p><strong>Friday October 22</strong></p> <p><strong>Taras Bulba</strong> (J Lee Thompson, 1962)<br> 1.30pm, BBC2</p> <p>Full-blooded saga of 16th-century cossacks rising against the Poles, Yul Brynner haughtily effective in the title role. Slightly less successful is Tony Curtis as his rebellious son, Andrei. Thompson directs at a gallop, with splendid battle scenes.</p> <p><strong>Eyes Wide Shut</strong> (Stanley Kubrick, 1999)<br> 10pm, Five</p> <p>The subject is sex, so it's all the stranger that Kubrick concluded his brilliant career with a whisper rather than a bang. It's the story of a Manhattan doctor driven by fantasies of his wife's infidelity to take a sexual twirl on a sultry night. As the couple, Tom Cruise seems out of his depth, Nicole Kidman more attuned to sexual danger; but at least as interesting as the on-screen action is what the performances said about the actors' own soon--to-end marriage.</p> <p><strong>Horror Express</strong> (Eugenio Martin, 1972)<br> 1. 05am, BBC1</p> <p>A train chugs along the Trans- Siberian railway in the early 1900s; on board are rival anthropologists Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, and a long-frozen creature, which proceeds to wake up with a really bad temper. What more could you ask for? Terrific fun.</p> <p><strong>Gummo</strong> (Harmony Korine, 1997)<br> 2.15am, Five</p> <p>Korine's directing debut is in similar teenie-sex-shock-horror style as the notorious Kids. It's set in an American mid-west suburb where two boys (Jacob Reynolds, Nick Sutton) combat the old teenage ennui by sniffing glue, killing cats and looking for sex. Grim but audacious stuff.</p>",
  "<p>On the surface there is little to commend Larry David. He'll obsess about his clothes and men who wear thongs on the beach. He'll arrange to play golf with his manager on his wife's birthday, wrongly accuse fellow passengers of stealing his airline tickets and even smuggle the head of a stolen doll down the front of his trousers to appease the daughter of an important television executive. On top of that, he's a compulsive liar worth $600m.</p> <p>But at a time when the British public finds itself short of genuine American heroes, this balding, disaster-prone, Brooklyn-born neurotic has emerged as the unlikeliest of saviours. Curb Your Enthusiasm, about David's cosseted LA life as the co-creator of Seinfeld, depicts a man at war with the world, yet prepared to own up to his many faults.</p> <p>In episodes past he has been variously branded a \"four-eyed fuck\", \"a self-hating Jew\" and \"a pool of wrong\", not to mention a misogynist. Gloriously glum, he is a curmudgeon, the bearer of a torch passed on by Woody Allen, Homer Simpson and Hank Hill. He rails against the foibles of polite society while finding a way to insult almost everyone he comes into contact with.</p> <p>David insists that the Larry David we see in the show is an exaggeration of the real thing - albeit someone he'd enjoy being in real life. On the recent evidence of a public dispute with an architecture magazine that ran a feature on his home in Martha's Vineyard, the divide between the real and fictional Larry is becoming increasingly blurred. He insists he will use the spat as the basis for a new episode.</p> <p>\"The show hugely exaggerates things,\" insists Jeff Garlin, who plays the repugnant if loyal Jeff Greene, of his famously media-shy colleague. \"In real life Larry's a real good guy. I'm about to enter my fifth year working with him. If he was like he is in the show in real life, there's no way I could do that.\"</p> <p>If the premise of CYE - Larry's life, Larry's friends, Larry's issues - sounds knowing to the point of self-indulgent, that's because it is. In real life, David is the failed bra salesman turned frustrated stand-up comedian, infamous in comedy circles for walking off stage. He happily admits scouting New York for places to doss if he hit bottom.</p> <p>After an unproductive year writing for Saturday Night Live he hooked up with old pal Jerry Seinfeld in the late 1980s and together they co-created and wrote the seminal US comedy \"about nothing\", Seinfeld. You might be forgiven for thinking that the fame and fortune from a global sensation would have cured Larry David of his melancholy, but you would be wrong.</p> <p>A recurring theme of the show, which starts filming on a fifth series in January 2005, is Larry's fretting about the minutiae of life. He worries about his pants forming a \"tent\" when he sits down, the heating at his aunt's funeral and whether his friend's grandfather did actually invent the Cobb salad.</p> <p>When Alan Partridge does this sort of thing it's because he's essentially an empty man with nothing else to occupy him. With Larry David, however, you feel that this rubbish really concerns him. Somehow it's comforting to know that a great home, whopping bank balance and a gorgeous, tolerant younger wife doesn't always add up to an easy life.</p> <p>Like its comic peers, Seinfeld and The Office, CYE scores with its realism, but unlike both it is unscripted. David prepares an eight-page plot outline and the actors are then required to improvise their dialogue. Multiple takes are filmed on handheld cameras. David and his team of executive editors then piece the best bits together and let the complex plots unfold to a now familiar Italian circus soundtrack. The results are consistently spectacular, compelling you to view unfolding disasters through the gaps in your fingers while tubas fart in the background.</p> <p>Curb Your Enthusiasm shines an unforgiving light on a vacuous world populated by characters such as Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (George and Elaine from Seinfeld), Ted Danson and Rob Reiner, who all play versions of themselves. By season four, which has just finished its run in the States, Martin Scorsese, Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer and Mel Brooks have also joined the fray.</p> <p>Art is made to imitate life and vice versa. In season two, we find David pitching an idea for a show about an actor who finds it hard to get work because they are so identified with their character from a hit comedy. Spotters will know that Jason Alexander's character in Seinfeld, the stooge George Costanza, is largely based on the real Larry David.</p> <p>After a petty row with Jason Alexander, Larry takes the idea to Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who loves it. She is keen to pitch the idea to HBO, but her hopes are dashed when first Larry accuses the HBO president of stealing his prawns after a mix-up at the Chinese takeaway and then insults another HBO executive by calling him \"a cunt\" during a friendly game of poker. </p> <p>Their last remaining hope of getting a commission is extinguished when Larry traumatises the daughter of a key executive at ABC by cutting the hair off her prize doll. It is this belter of an episode in which Larry and his manager Jeff (alongside wife Cheryl, the only other main character played by an actor) are rumbled in the process of burgling the house of Jeff's estranged wife, played by the brilliantly foul-mouthed Susie Essman.</p> <p>\"I guess I'm a pretty likable guy,\" says Garlin, asked whether there's any resemblance to his character. \"Jeff Greene does some pretty horrible stuff. It would be fair to say that Larry and Jeff's friendship has survived against the odds. There are no lines that cannot be crossed. As you will see in future seasons there are some things that if I pulled them on anybody else, they'd say, 'Get the fuck away from me'.\"</p> <p>The genesis of the show could have been lifted from one of David's story outlines. He and Garlin were renting offices in the same Santa Monica block and one day, post Seinfeld, David invited Garlin to lunch. \"He was asking me questions about stand-up comedy and I told him that if he wanted to do an HBO special I had the perfect idea,\" explains Garlin, who had previously produced specials for comedians Denis Leary and Jon Stewart.</p> <p>The result was the hour-long HBO special, Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, written by David and first screened in the US in 1999. Essentially a mockumentary about the making of an HBO special, it follows Larry as he prepares to make a comeback in stand-up. Forty shows and 20 hours of classic comedy later, David and Garlin, also an executive producer on Curb, continue to lunch both on screen and off.</p> <p>Going out on cable (HBO) has undoubtedly allowed David to trespass into areas restricted on mainstream American TV - even to the extent of poking fun at his paymasters. Politically incorrect gags about the disabled, racial minorities and the Holocaust, plus musings on topics as diverse as children getting drunk and incest survivor groups, ensure that the humour is rarely less than reassuringly dark.</p> <p>David recently wrote an open letter to John Kerry, offering his services as a vice-presidential running mate. In it he suggested \"whatever qualities Bush has that people find appealing... I have those same qualities in spades\". This from a man who caused a religious war at the baptism of his wife's sister's Jewish fianc\u00e9e, from someone who Mel Brooks describes in the final episode filmed to date as \"a storm that will destroy everything in its path\".</p> <p>Although he might hate me for saying it, I still believe Larry David is a man capable of restoring our faith in America.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Curb Your Enthusiasm - The Complete Second Series is out on DVD on Monday. Season three is showing on E4</p>",
  "<p>After an entire summer spent dealing with the issue of family catering by slinging bread, cheese and a bit of salad on the table, and attempting to pass it off as a proper meal, I concede, now the nights are drawing in, that perhaps it's time to re-establish some sort of working relationship with the cooker. Apart from anything else, my saucepans have cobwebs in them. It's probably the biggest hint yet that I should call a halt to this pitiful domestic slacking and knuckle down to producing some decent hot dinners. </p> <p>What a bore. In my experience, properly cooked meals, if they are to be at all edible and/or nutritionally balanced, demand forethought, lengthy columns of five ingredients or more and a flair for timing, sauce consistency and seasoning. Even the simplest dishes seem to require basic accessorising, some sort of garnish and an instinctive knowledge of what to do with giblets, a white-wine reduction and pastry crust. </p> <p>I count none of these among my natural gifts, despite the fact that everything about my kitchen bellows accomplished cook. If I didn't know otherwise, I'd say that Mrs Beeton herself had been the previous incumbent, dreaming up junkets and suet puddings on an Aga the size of a small family saloon, backed up by a great many businesslike work surfaces and shelves heaving with recipe books. But the truth is, I feel like an impostor in this gloriously clich\u00e9d rural tableau. I possess not one iota of natural flair for cooking. In a former existence, I was surely an under-nourished drop-out in a bedsit with nothing but a solitary milk pan and single gas ring for company. </p> <p>I am a little ashamed to admit that I have in my repertoire just five hot \"dishes\". I hesitate to call them dishes, because the description suggests a certain elevated position on the culinary scale. Instead, I suspect my winter-long rotation of spaghetti bolognese, chicken curry, macaroni cheese, roast chicken and lasagne fall squarely into the perfunctory meal category. I am horribly aware that they gain me precisely no points for imagination, experimentation or effort. I don't care how many times Nigel Slater trumpets the notion of simple, warming fare, I am bored, my family is bored. I have reached such a stage of culinary paranoia that I feel the Aga is shooting me reproachful glances. My utensils are mocking me. I am not getting the best out of them and they deserve to be stretched. </p> <p>Of course, it is for just this kind of inertia that cookery books exist, and I certainly have plenty of those. From Gary Rhodes to Rick Stein, Nigella Lawson to Mary Berry, if ever inspiration were required, I have it in spades. But proof of my aversion lies in the unusually pristine state of my recipe library. Dedicated, habitual cooks leave the marks of their toil; in my books, you won't find telltale spatterings of coulis and red wine jus besmirching their pages. There is, too, a shameful absence of stuck-together chapters soiled with the sweat of producing sauce hollandaise and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Lack of confidence, fear of failure and, perhaps, plain idleness prevent me from spattering vanilla custard with wild abandon. There have been, in the past, occasional flurries of courage, but more often than not they have ended in disappointment: Jamie Oliver's fish pie - rubbish; ditto the dried-out depth-charge that was meant to be his meltingly moist chocolate cake. After each crushing blow to my already fragile self-esteem, I went scurrying to Delia Smith's Complete Illustrated Cookery Course - the Janet and John of easily-digested cooking literature - like a bullied and harangued child back to its mother. As a result, I don't know why I'm even bothering to look at Gordon Ramsay's eye-wateringly complex recipe for roast skate with beetroot and parmesan. </p> <p>It's a complete waste of time, too, studying the pages of the Ivy cookbook and, in particular, an interesting-sounding truffled mixed artichokes with corn salad and herbs. Futile in the extreme is the time I am spending leafing through the Moro cookbook, slavering over things like manteca colorada (pork rillettes to you), because there isn't a chance in hell of any of it appearing on the menu of a dinner party catered by me. </p> <p>All in all, I suspect I conform to the universal truth that the more recipe books a person owns, the less they actually cook. I am well aware that this probably puts me in the very highest category of food-porn offenders. I hold up my hands as a culinary pervert, a domestic dirty mac, a furtive fumbler with a stash of material to challenge that of the lustiest teenager, but who is resigned to looking, dreaming and fantasising, but never actually attaining. </p> <p>Can this be at all healthy? Surely it's the sort of attitude that turns solitary, socially inept pornography users into rabid women-haters and people like me into the sort of disturbed individuals who sneer at provocative sachets of juniper berries, take long detours in Waitrose to avoid the exotic seasonings aisle, and develop irrational loathings of hard-to-obtain ingredients such as black cod and banana leaves. Clearly, I have a problem, and I'm not sure even Delia can help this time.</p>",

  "Spiralling political violence and looting in Haiti has overwhelmed UN peacekeeping forces and threatens to escalate further this weekend as former soldiers of the disbanded national army gather in the capital ready to take on street gangs loyal to the exiled president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. <p>Businesses, schools and shops were shuttered in Port-au-Prince yesterday as residents braced for bloody clashes between supporters of the ex-leader demanding his return to power and the former soldiers who led a rebellion that led to Mr Aristide's departure in February. </p> <p>With only 3,000 of the 8,000 troops promised, the Brazilian-led UN peacekeeping force has a fraction of the troops and police it says it needs to control the volatile situation. </p> <p>\"As long as we don't have the increase in forces, it's going to be very difficult,\" the Brazilian foreign minister, Celso Amorim, told reporters in Brasilia. </p> <p>The latest upsurge in violence began on September 30 when Aristide supporters marked the anniversary of a the 1991 military coup against him. Police reportedly killed two demonstrators. </p> <p>Since the protests began at least 48 people have been killed, including at least six beheaded by suspected pro-Aristide gangs known as \"chimere\", who have launched what they are called \"Operation Baghdad\". </p> <p>Aristide gangs retain control of many of Port-au-Prince's sprawling slums and are demanding his return, the disarming of rebels and an end to the \"invasion\" of troops from Brazil and other nations. </p> <p>Tensions were further heightened this week with the arrest of a Roman Catholic priest, Gerard Jean-Juste, an ardent supporter of Aristide. </p> <p>The justice minister, Bernard Gousse, told a news conference Mr Jean-Juste's detention - along with others held without warrants - was necessary to curb the violence. Authorities believe the priest had links to \"perpetrators of the barbaric acts\" and that he \"was sheltering these people\", he said. </p> <p>Angered by the arrest, armed gangs stormed the central neighbourhood of Poste Marchard, firing gunshots into the air and burning cars as drivers and pedestrians scattered. </p> <p>With the escalation of the violence, the US decided to allow non-emergency embassy staff and relatives to leave the country, and the state department asked Americans to consider leaving Haiti. </p> <p>The clashes in the capital have hampered humanitarian agency efforts in the north-west city of Gonaives, where tropical storm Jeanne killed as many as 3,000 and left tens of thousands homeless. </p> <p>The UN world food programme said 113 containers of relief food for Gonaives was blocked at Port-au-Prince because of the lack of workers, and that a road convoy was unable to leave yesterday because peacekeepers assigned to escort it were too busy patrolling the capital. </p> <p>Many aid agencies attempting to distribute humanitarian aid in Gonaives have suspended operations after members of six organisations were attacked by hungry looters and organised gangs. </p> <p>\"The risk is too high and we just don't know what to expect over the weekend because there are rumours that the gangs plan to target the peacekeeping troops directly,\" said Maite Alvarez, an Oxfam spokeswoman in Haiti. </p> <p>Army officers led a bloody rebellion that drove Mr Aristide from power in February. The former leader, who says he was kidnapped by the US government, is in exile in South Africa. He claims he is still the legitimate leader of Haiti. </p> <p>The UN mission took over peacekeeping in Haiti in June from a UN-sanctioned multinational force led by the US marines. The force is expected to reach its full size of 8,300, including 1,600 police, in November.</p>",
  "It's all too easy to be negative about life, especially when there are some areas of life where we're clearly getting better. <p>For instance, we're much better at being rude to each other. We've improved beyond recognition in the past few years. And much of the credit for this must go to telephone cold-calling staff. </p> <p>I can't be the only person to find their phone is being over-run by junk calls. You're busy with something useful, like pouring yourself a stiff drink after work, when the phone rings. It's someone trying to sell you insurance for your electric toothbrush or claiming that you've won a prize in a competition you've never entered. Or else it's \"research\" into plastic doors or an invitation to collect a free holiday. </p> <p>A few years ago, we would have been politely defensive, and taking care not to offend, we'd have said thanks, but no thanks. In fact, we'd have been so darned polite we'd have been exchanging Christmas cards by the end of it. Now the receiver gets slammed down quicker than a Tequila on a Mexican stag night. No more Mr Nice Guy. No more small talk. And they've learned to be rude back. </p> <p>I was called this week by a gas tout trying to push me into changing supplier. When I didn't jump at the opportunity, they put the phone down on me. And again, full marks for rudeness. Disturb someone at home and then cut them off. But who falls for these calls? There must be some sucker feeding these sharks. </p> <p>\"So you're offering a free holiday? All we have to do is pay a \u00a3100 booking fee and attend a two-day time-share presentation in an interrogation centre, strapped into a chair without any food, water or natural light. Sounds like a great opportunity. Thanks for taking the time to call me.\" </p> <p>It's like those emails from fraudsters pretending to come from your bank. I know we write scare stories about these scams - but have you seen the cack-handed way these fakes are written? If those boys got hold a spell-checker they'd be dangerous. </p> <p>Another unsung group of heroes in the rudeness revolution are the chuggers - those hyperactive charity collectors who block the pavement with their clipboards, punchable smiles and over-sized egos. Pedestrians now blank them without even a flicker of recognition. They've become shopping centre roadkill. And their remarkable achievement is that when someone mentions any of these hard-working charities, I immediately think of these jerks hassling people. </p> <p>This rudeness epidemic is everywhere, as though in a single generation we've gone from tongue-tied introverts to a bunch of mouthy New York cab drivers. Airport check-ins, shops, restaurants, there's always someone throwing a tantrum. We've become confrontation junkies. \"Whaddya mean the bank's closing? You talking to me? You talking to me, Mr Mainwaring?\" They used to say that people in this country didn't know how to complain. Now we don't know when to shut up.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.coughlan@virgin.net\">s.coughlan@virgin.net</a></p>",
  "It is one of Tel Aviv's busiest office buildings. A constant stream of taxis pulls up and departs. Inside there is an air of businesslike activity. Suddenly, raised voices echo through the building. A woman shouts: \"I am not a sucker. I won't let you do what you want. You're wasting your time.\" <p>This is Tel Aviv's rabbinical court, and its main business is divorce. Divorce in Israel is not recognised unless it is sanctified by a rabbinical judge under Jewish laws dating back more than 2,000 years. Unfortunately for the woman who is determined not to be a \"sucker\", the laws are heavily weighted in favour of men. </p> <p>A man can ask for divorce if a wife spoils his meal or if he prefers another woman. While a woman has no power to refuse a divorce, a man can stop the divorce process whenever he wants. </p> <p>Igal Cohen, 32, is standing in the corridor and smoking nervously. He and his wife, Yelene, began divorce proceedings in January, but it is only this week that their marital bond has been severed. </p> <p>He is waiting to perform the final ceremony, and although he has completed civil proceedings to work out custody of their 10-year-old son, it will not be final until it is recognised by a religious court. </p> <p>In the days of the Torah, divorce simply required the husband to write a document and send his wife away. But during the first 2,000 years of Jewish life, rabbis created a legal framework to make it more difficult. It is this framework which has been enshrined in Israeli law. </p> <p>The couple must give their reasons for the divorce and the judges establish their identity. There follows a ceremony in which the man expels the woman from his life and gives her a divorce certificate, a get. </p> <p>The laws were finalised around 2,000 years ago when Aramaic was the language of Judaism, so the get is written in Aramaic, which virtually no one understands. </p> <p>Despite the tensions, many couples manage their divorce together. One man writes his application and says to his wife, sitting across the table: \"You are going to sign it. It doesn't matter if I am guilty or not, you are signing it.\" </p> <p>One couple emerges from the ceremony with smiles on their faces. The man says: \" Mazel tov, Mazel tov \" - \"Congratulations\". </p> <p>There are also outbursts of tears and anger. The secular couples have tried to make an effort to dress for the rabbis. Women wear long skirts and men wear kippas which sit uneasily on their heads. </p> <p>Igal and Yelene are not speaking and stand apart. Eventually they are summoned to the rabbi. Within a minute, Igal emerges with a wide smile. </p> <p>\"It's done. The rabbi just checked the document and I said to my wife, 'I expel you.' She walked three steps forwards with both hands upturned; I placed the get in her hands; she walked backwards three steps, and that was it,\" he said. </p> <p>As he smiled, his wife and her brother walked past without saying a word to Igal. </p> <p>Many Israeli women complain that the process humiliates them. Michal Schonbrun said she had been accused by a rabbi of destroying her marriage by not taking a ritual bath after menstruation. </p> <p>\"I swallowed my pride and went to the final ceremony, which I saw as a bit of Jewish voodoo,\" she said. </p> <p>Irit Rosenblum, the director of the pressure group New Family, is calling for reform. </p> <p>\"The divorce ceremony is humiliating for women in many ways,\" she said. \"In some ways it is more liberal than Catholicism and Islam, but it is completely out of step with modern Israel.\"</p>",
  "<p>You may have a nasty surprise in store if you are planning to pick up Christmas gifts at bargain prices, either on a shopping trip abroad or from foreign vendors over the internet. </p> <p>Most travellers are aware that you can bring certain amounts of alcohol, tobacco and perfume into the UK from abroad without being charged import duty or VAT. But it may come as a shock to learn that there is a pretty measly \u00a3145 limit on goods you can bring in duty and tax-free from countries outside the EU. </p> <p>This was certainly the case earlier this month for Coleen McLoughlin, fianc\u00e9e of soccer superstar Wayne Rooney, when she was held by Customs &amp; Excise after attempting to bring thousands of pounds worth of designer shopping from New York into Britain without paying duty and tax. </p> <p>While her oversight was attributed to ignorance rather than any criminal intent, this didn't rescue the 18-year-old from having to pay a hefty import duty and VAT bill on her purchases - a charge which is typically 20% of the original purchase price. </p> <p>The onus is on you, the importer, to declare purchases bought outside the EU which exceed the \u00a3145 duty-free allowance. That means coming through the red channel when you enter the country or using the red point phone. </p> <p>If you don't, you are breaking the law and Customs may prosecute you on top of charging you duty and VAT. </p> <p>For the full low-down on what you can and cannot bring in duty-free and VAT-free from countries outside the EU, check out the Customs &amp; Excise booklet Notice 1: Customs Guide for Travellers Entering the UK before you go abroad.

And, if you are travelling as a family or group, you can't pool your individual allowances towards an item. </p> <p>Also, if you bring into the country any duty-free or tax-free goods you bought when you left the UK, these will count as part of your allowance. </p> <p>Keep the receipts for items you buy outside the EU, especially if you have picked up some bargains. If you have no proof of the purchase price, Customs officers will charge duty and VAT on what they deem a realistic price for them - possibly far higher than what you actually paid. </p> <p>Buying goods from internet vendors outside the EU can be even pricier, because duty-free allowances do not apply. Duty and VAT are payable if you buy goods worth \u00a318 or more from outside the EU. </p> <p>To clear the package through Customs, the Post Office or other freight forwarder will pay duty and VAT charges on your behalf and then collect the charges from you before handing over the package.

  "President Muammar Gadafy yesterday embarrassed his latest high-profile western visitor, the German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, by demanding compensation for thousands of landmines left in the Libyan desert during the second world war. <p>During talks in Tripoli, Mr Gadafy complained that dozens of Libyans were still being injured and killed by the anti-tank mines, which were buried by Erwin Rommel and his retreating army more than 60 years ago.</p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der's trip is the first by a German chancellor to what until recently was a rogue state. It came after Libya agreed in August to pay $35m (about \u00a319m) in compensation to the non-US victims of a 1986 disco bombing in west Berlin, which killed three people and injured 230. The bombing was widely blamed on Libyan agents.</p> <p>The visit also follows the EU's decision on Monday to lift sanctions, and a similar trip to Tripoli by Tony Blair in March.</p> <p>Yesterday, however, German officials confirmed that the notoriously unpredictable Libyan leader had suggested over an impromptu three-hour banquet that Germany should pay compensation. Libyans were still dying from mines left by the Germany army, he said.</p> <p>He also showed Mr Schr\u00f6der maps of where the mines had been buried.</p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der replied that it was in the interests of both countries to put the past behind them.</p> <p>As many as 18m landmines litter Libya's western deserts. There are also a particularly high number around the Egyptian town of El Alamein, where in 1942 the British army under Bernard Montgomery decisively defeated Rommel's Afrika Korps, in one of the war's most crucial battles.</p> <p>Not all of the mines are German: many are British and Italian.</p> <p>They continue to explode, wounding and injuring bedouin tribes and children. German officials in Berlin appear to have been caught off guard by Mr Gadafy's demand and yesterday said merely that both sides would work on the issue. There appears to be little prospect, however, of compensation.</p> <p>During discussions held in Mr Gadafy's famous tent, the Libyan leader also praised Germany and France for their key role in opposing last year's US-led invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>Mr Gadafy suggested that Arab states and Europe should work together to defeat American influence - a suggestion Mr Schr\u00f6der politely failed to endorse.</p> <p>The trip follows the Libyan leader's announcement last year that his country was to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programme, and his agreement to pay com-pensation for the 1988 Locker bie bombing in which 270 people died.</p> <p>But the visit is as much about economics as politics. Twenty German executives have travelled to Tripoli with Mr Schr\u00f6der, who yesterday flew to an oasis south of the capital to open a German-run oil well.</p> <p>The chancellor suggested that one motive for his visit was to ensure that Germany got ahead in the surge of western economic interest in Libya.</p> <p>The country's \"enormous resources\" mattered to German industry, he said.</p> <p>He called Mr Gadafy's political change \"really remarkable\", adding that Germany \"could only welcome that\". He said Libya's new course deserved \"every support\".</p> <p>But Mr Schr\u00f6der conceded the two countries still had \"differences of approach\" towards the United States, for instance. And German government officials said Mr Schr\u00f6der would raise concerns about human rights in Libya in his talks with Mr Gadafy, who has kept a tight control over politics since he seized power in a military coup in 1969.</p>",

  "<p>Muslims must reach out and connect with other Britons as equal citizens, and resist the impulse to withdraw into isolated communities, one of the foremost thinkers on Islam in Europe will tell his audience this evening at the European Social Forum in London. </p> <p>Tariq Ramadan urges Muslims to embrace and get to know the culture and history of the countries they live in in Europe, and develop a \"blossoming\" confidence as the inheritors of Islam, one of Europe's great faiths. </p> <p>\"The situation is bad throughout Europe, and now is the time for Muslims to reach out and create partnerships,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Muslims must stop the perception of victimisation and their obsession with their minority status - that way we are nurturing the idea that we are not really at home here, and that is reinforced by governments. </p> <p>\"There are millions of Muslims in Europe and always have been. It is a distorted history which omits the role of Islam in the construction of European consciousness.\" </p> <p>In recent years, Mr Ramadan, the author of several academic books, has been attacked from all sides for attempting to formulate a modern, moderate, confident Islam. </p> <p>He has been named as one of the 100 most influential thinkers in the world by Time magazine, but that did not stop his US visa being revoked under the Patriot Act in July, when he wanted to take up a professorship at Notre Dame University in Indiana. </p> <p>Mr Ramadan, who was born and educated in Geneva, is teaching by teleconference while the US authorities reconsider his application. </p> <p>He had been admitted to the US many times, and given a presentation to the state department on European Islam. </p> <p>He has also been barred from many Muslim countries for his advocacy of democracy and human rights. </p> <p>\"A silent revolution is coming in how Muslims think about themselves and about the universal common values they share with the west, and about democracy and modernity,\" he says. The develop-ment of a European Islam will have a \"tremendous impact on Islam throughout the world\". </p> <p>But Mr Ramadan says fear is being used as an ideological weapon: \"It gives governments a kind of political control - 'We will monitor you in order to protect you' - a new ideology when all the others are so empty.\" </p> <p>At stake, he says, is not just the wellbeing of the Muslim community, but the values and principles of western democracy: \"The way Muslim people are treated is undermining British values such as freedom of conscience, equality before the law, and anti-racism.\" </p> <p>\"We need to develop mutual knowledge, not just tolerance. The question is, what are you doing to find out about others? Respect comes out of knowledge; when you recognise my reality is as complex as yours, that's when you begin to know me andrespect me.\" </p> <p>Mr Ramadan's grandfather, Hassan al-Banna, was the founder of one of the most powerful Muslim political movements in the 20th century, the Muslim Brotherhood. But Mr Ramadan is careful to distinguish his own thinking, particularly on violence. </p> <p>\"There is an acceptable diversity within Islam, but killing innocent lives has to be condemned,\" he says. In situations such as modern-day Israel, \"the context may explain the killing, but it can never justify it\". </p> <p><strong>Highlights of the European Social Forum</strong></p> <p><strong>Today</strong> </p> <p>Debates: Muslims in Europe; disarmament; world food day; environment; third world; European citizenship </p> <p>Culture: Palestine rappers; Dark art music; Rasta international; Iraq - the opera; films on the WTO, water and Argentina </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow</strong> </p> <p>March from Russell Square to Trafalgar Square, 1pm </p> <p>Debates: Iraq occupation; IMF and World Bank; privatisation </p> <p>Culture: Italian marching protest band; Brazilian Capoeira; Asian Dub Foundation, Peter Doherty and others</p>",
  "<p>Each year over 40,000 workers die or suffer major injuries at work in Britain, and since April 1992, over 1,000 workers in the construction industry alone have lost their lives. Between April 2003 and March 2004, 70 building workers lost their lives, accounting for 30% of all the deaths at work last year and in the past six months, 37 construction workers died on building sites across Britain. </p> <p>It's against this sombre backdrop that next week has been designated European Week of Health and Safety. The focus of European Health and Safety Week 2004 is \"building in safety\", which aims to make the construction industry a safer, healthier and more productive working environment. </p> <p>TUC deputy general secretary, Frances O'Grady, says: \"Construction deaths at work are on the increase again. Employers will only change their poor health and safety practices when they realise that they are likely to be punished if found guilty of causing the deaths of their staff or members of the public. The government must publish its proposals for a new corporate manslaughter law before the beginning of the next session of Parliament.\" </p> <p>The number of construction workers in Britain has risen by almost 100,000 in the past decade, so a rise in accidents was likely. But, says Ms O'Grady, the industry still needs to end irresponsible working practices that endangers lives. </p> <p>The European Health and Safety Week is also giving a special attention to the maintenance and repair activities that are carried out in all workplaces, and the risks from asbestos exposure. According to the health and safety executive's data there are half a million commercial properties in the UK containing undisturbed asbestos. </p> <p>Asbestos is the biggest occupational health risk ever faced by workers in Britain, at least 3,500 people died in 2002-03 as a result of exposure to asbestos fibres. The annual number of deaths is expected to peak somewhere in the range 4,000 to 5,000, between the years 2011 and 2015. However, the actual peak figure could be even higher. </p> <p>From last May, anyone who owns commercial or industrial property or is responsible for its maintenance, must check for asbestos and manage the risk properly. The same will apply to public buildings and to the common parts of other property such as blocks of flats. Asbestos becomes dangerous when disturbed; if maintenance workers are not warned of its presence they may release deadly fibres and unwittingly endanger lives. </p> <p>Bill Callaghan, chairman of the Health and Safety Commission, says: \"Asbestos is not yesterday's problem. We must now meet the challenge of managing the risks from asbestos, if we are to prevent another generation of workers suffering an early death at its hand.\" </p> <p>In a separate move, an Institute of Employment Rights report highlights the extent to which the UK government has failed to meet its own targets for improvement contributing to the health and safety at work issue. The report - Health and Safety: Revitalised or Reversed? - argues that a voluntary approach to health and safety established by the 1974 Health and Safety Act has failed. Enforcement of health and safety has declined with a 12% cut in local authority inspectors and a 20% cut in workplace visits. </p> <p> <em>Health and Safety: Revitalised or Reversed? by Phil James and David Walters priced \u00a320 is available from IER, 177 Abbeville Road, London SW4 9RL.</em></p> <p><strong> \u00b7</strong> For Health and Safety Executive's InfoLine, tel: 08701 545500, or write to: HSE Information Services, Caerphilly Business Park, Caerphilly CF83 3GG.</p>",
  "<p>Three former NatWest bankers were told yesterday they should be extradited to the United States to face fraud charges connected to the collapsed energy company Enron. </p> <p>A judge in Bow Street magistrates court concluded that the three should be sent for trial in Houston despite their protestations that their alleged crimes took place in Britain and they would not receive a fair trial in Texas, where Enron was based. </p> <p>The three immediately said they would appeal against the decision, which the district judge, Nicholas Evans, admitted might lead to them receiving a \"substantial term of imprisonment\" if convicted by an American jury. </p> <p>Mr Evans has sent the case to David Blunkett, the home secretary, who will make the final decision on extradition. The three have six weeks in which to make representations to Mr Blunkett and then have another two weeks to launch a formal appeal once his decision is made, their spokesman said. </p> <p>The three - David Bermingham, Gary Mulgrew and Giles Darby - are alleged to have schemed with Andrew Fastow, Enron's former finance director, and his right-hand man, Michael Kopper, to defraud NatWest. They are not implicated in the collapse of the energy company, however. The three men sat closely together in court, at times holding their heads in their hands. </p> <p>Outside the Bow Street court yesterday, Mr Bermingham urged the British authorities to take up the case so they could face trial here. They believe they will have to sell their homes to cover the cost of a US trial and fear they will be denied bail by the US authorities while they await trial. </p> <p>Mr Bermingham said it would take \"one phone call [by the US] to the Serious Fraud Office or the Crown Prosecution Services and they could bring upon us the might of the UK legal system\". </p> <p>\"We repeat that request to the US government. Bring the action here ... where it belongs,\" Mr Bermingham said. </p> <p>\"We will be appealing the decision, not just for ourselves but also for others who will inevitably also be caught up in the government's extradition law changes,\" he added. The Extradition Act, which became law this year and was designed to speed up action against terrorists, does not require the United States to set out a case against the men to secure their extradition. Prior to this, the government could block an extradition if it felt it was unfair. </p> <p>Mark Spragg, the bankers' solicitor, accused the US government of waiting until the law change was introduced before applying to extradite them. He said the appeal would be on the grounds that the court should have considered the \"rights and wrongs\" of the extradition in the way the government used to. </p> <p>Mr Evans said: \"I am told these defendants would welcome a prosecution in the UK as it would give them the opportunity to clear their names.\" </p> <p>However, he said that if the SFO did now begin an investigation, by the time it came to any proceedings being taken against the three they could argue the case had taken too long to come to court and should be stayed. </p> <p>He accepted their argument that they would have to leave their homes and family to face trial in the US as an \"unattractive position\". </p> <p>\"Serious and complex cases do disrupt family life and interfere with earning a living but that doesn't mean that extradition to face trial is incompatible with [human rights law],\" he added. </p> <p>The US authorities have based their case on evidence that the three men gave to the Financial Services Authority. </p> <p>Sir Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman and Mr Mulgrew's MP, said he was anxious about whether his constituent and co-defendants would face a fair trial. He cited concerns about links between Enron and the Bush administration. </p> <p>Mr Mulgrew's mother is Trish Godman, deputy speaker of the Scottish Parliament. </p> <p>The three are due to reappear at Bow Street on Tuesday for a bail hearing.</p>",
  "Foreign Office mandarins may well be irritated by the undiplomatic behaviour of Craig Murray, who has been formally removed as British ambassador to Uzbekistan. But he has raised a vital issue that lies at the heart of the \"war on terror\" and this country's role in it. Mr Murray's complaint, unrelated to questions about his professional performance, private life and health, is that MI6 has been using bogus intelligence obtained under torture by a government with a dire human rights record. His objections, raised in an internal FCO memo and amplified in media interviews yesterday, is that this practice should be eschewed on moral, legal and practical grounds. <p>Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic of 26 million people, has found its strategic importance greatly enhanced by the way the world has changed since 9/11. President Islam Karimov now plays host to a US base that is crucial to military operations in neighbouring Afghanistan. But violence has also come to his own backyard, with bomb blasts and shoot-outs in Tashkent and near the Silk Road city of Bukhara. Uzbek officials insist they are fighting militants linked to al-Qaida. Foreigners point to poverty and the imprisonment of dissident Muslims angered by a crackdown on those who worship outside state-run mosques. Every year about 200 people are executed in Uzbekistan, with the killings carried out in secret and families denied a last meeting with convicted relatives. Amnesty International receives regular and credible allegations of unfair trials, ill-treatment and torture - described as \"endemic\" by a UN envoy - often to extract confessions. The information - \"dross,\" says this renegade diplomat- is passed to the US, and thence to UK intelligence and security bodies. </p> <p>Mr Murray's complaint fits into a broader and worrying pattern that is visible both at home and abroad. The Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Abu Ghreib prison scandals have done much to tarnish the legitimate effort to prevent terrorist atrocities. The law lords are due to rule shortly on the highly controversial question of whether British courts may use evidence extracted under torture as long as British agents are not complicit in the abuse. It is only three weeks since Sir Ivor Roberts, the British ambassador to Italy, described George Bush as al-Qaida's best recruiting sergeant, though his remarks were made in private. The more junior Mr Murray has been bolder in speaking out publicly. His career prospects - and an eventual knighthood - are now looking distinctly uncertain. But he has performed a valuable public service by following the dictates of his conscience.</p>",
  "<p>Trade union leaders yesterday called on the government and employers to take immediate action to tackle the problem of the growing numbers of workers being killed on Britain's building sites. </p> <p>The TUC is asking the government to fulfil its manifesto pledge to bring in legislation on corporate manslaughter and wants employers to put much greater emphasis on training employees. </p> <p>\"Construction [industry] deaths are on the increase. Employers will only change their poor health and safety practices when they realise that they are likely to be punished if found guilty of causing the deaths of their staff or members of the public,\" according to TUC deputy general secretary Frances O'Grady. </p> <p>\"The government must publish its proposals for a new corporate manslaughter law before the beginning of the next session of parliament,\" she added. </p> <p>The CBI responded by insisting that any legislation should be even-handed and apply equally to the public as well as the private sector. </p> <p>Michael Roberts, director of business environment at the employers' organisation, said: \"If the government is going to press ahead on corporate manslaughter, it must ensure that the legislation is fair. The grossly negligent must be separated from genuinely responsible employers who do everything possible to ensure safety.\" </p> <p>Figures from the TUC show that more than 1,000 workers have died on construction jobs since 1992. In the past six months alone 37 workers have lost their lives. </p> <p>The TUC says that part of the increase stems from structural changes in the industry as big companies turn increasingly to subcontractors. </p> <p>\"There are a lot of very small contractors, which makes it very difficult to manage [safety]. They don't do things like risk assessments and there is often very little communication between different groups,\" Hugh Robertson, the TUC's head of health and safety, said. </p> <p>Another factor is the growing use on construction sites of workers for whom English is not their first language. </p> <p>Mr Robertson argues that such workers need to be taught health and safety in their own languages. \"They have to understand the [safety] message, not simply be told it. If things are explained in English and they don't understand, they are not going to say so.\"</p>",
  "It is no surprise that Tony Blair would have made the same decision about Iraq, even if he had known there was no direct threat of WMD being used by Saddam (Robin Cook, Comment, October 15). But in a democracy decision-making extends beyond the prime minister. The question is how other people would have reacted if the truth had been known. <p>How would the cabinet have responded, the government more widely, the parliamentary Labour party, the opposition parties, government lawyers, Labour members, military leaders, the media, religious figures? It is almost certain that Mr Blair would have found it far more difficult to win the argument for war. That is why the issue is so important and why so many of us will not move on. </p> <p>Mr Blair no longer trusted democracy to support him and he would not allow his beliefs to be set aside. As a result, the truth became the exclusive property of an inner circle. The possibilities of other international strategies and policies to deal with Iraq were nullified only by the urgency of the threat described by Mr Blair. Mr Blair may not be corrupt, but in his innocence he has corrupted our democracy. His apology, festooned with caveats, is not the point. The question is whether our democracy is now weakened, perhaps irretrievably.<br> <b>Peter Martindale</b><br> Grantham, Lincs </p> <p>Isn't it time we stopped harassing the prime minister over Iraq?

Easy isn't it?\" </p> <p>Alan Milburn, Labour's election coordinator, said the email was a further sign of how far Michael Howard was taking his party to the right. </p> <p>Denis MacShane, the Europe minister, claimed: \"It is now Conservative party policy to pass national legislation which would mean Britain would be in breach of its solemn European Union treaty obligations as legislated by parliament. </p> <p>\"EU treaties constitute the binding international law allowing British firms to trade freely across 25 nations. </p> <p>\"Mr Redwood's action would either lead to massive fines from the European court of justice, or to Britain being obliged to quit the EU.\" </p> <p>In a letter to Mr Redwood, he suggests: \"Your email represents a fundamental crossing of the line that separates legitimate criticism of EU policies to the unilateral policy of being willing to breach the EU treaties and quit the EU.\" </p> <p>Sir Stephen Wall, a former British ambassador to the EU, also challenged Mr Redwood's approach, saying \"civil servants are under obligation not to carry out any act that would be illegal. </p> <p>\"And we could find ourselves before the European court facing very swingeing fines; I think it would be the first time that a British government had effectively torn up a treaty - that's normally something which dictatorships do, not normally something which democracies do.\" </p> <p>Many saw the energetic but strongly sceptic Mr Redwood's return to the shadow cabinet as a sign Mr Howard felt he needed to harden his antiEuropean message to shore up his support against an attack by Ukip. </p> <p>In an eve of conference setback for Mr Howard, Ukip drove the Conservatives into fourth place in the Hartlepool byelection. </p> <p>Subsequently, Tory morale was lifted when Paul Sykes, the chief funder of Ukip, said he was withdrawing in protest at its putting up a candidate against the Tories in every seat in next year's general election. </p> <p>The Conservatives may calculate that the British public is sufficiently sceptic that it will support strong-arm tactics against the EU, regardless of the potential for ejection from the EU altogether.</p>",
  "<p>House hunters may normally check the number of bedrooms, showers and noisy neighbours, but in one of Britain's newest housing estates they are being offered a novel incentive, the country's first dedicated hedgehog path. </p> <p>Buyers who move into Colney Reach, in a suburb of Norwich, are guaranteed a permanent procession of the mammals through a network of holes in fences and guided tracks which avoid their nemesis: local roads. </p> <p>\"This is absolutely fantastic,\" said Fay Vass, chief executive of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society, which has never before convinced developers that hedgehogs could help to sell homes. \"Quite apart from the pleasure of seeing hedgehogs, residents in Colney Reach should suffer less damage to their gardens. Hedgehogs love slugs and snails.\" </p> <p>The path is part of a biodiversity package offered by the estate's developer, Bovis, which is also treating local bird life in much the same way as estate agents classify clients. The two, three and four-bedroom houses come with bird boxes in five styles, depending on whether buyers want to attract sparrows, blue tits, house martins, robins or wrens. </p> <p>\"We take this sort of thing seriously,\" said Gareth Goodridge, marketing manager for Bovis in the south-east. \"It's a pleasure when development can enhance and preserve the natural surroundings.\" </p> <p>The first hedgehogs to scuttle along the pioneering trail may also get a civic reception, with Norwich city council delighted to have such a landmark on its patch. </p> <p>Hedgehogs have a long-standing hold on the British imagination despite the fact that their squashed remains are often the nearest many people get to seeing one at close range. </p> <p>The animals, which now get escape ramps in all new cattle grids, were made memorable by Beatrix Potter's Mrs Tiggywinkle and have never looked back.</p>",
  "<p>Looking forward to a relaxing retirement with enough cash for holidays and eating out? Think again, was this week's conclusion of a government-commissioned investigation into the plight of people saving for their retirement. </p> <p>It warned that more than 12m people are heading for pensions misery, either because they are saving little in their pensions or not at all. </p> <p>Even those who are saving into what might be regarded as decent occupational schemes can expect to live on a retirement income of a third less than that of today's average pensioner. </p> <p>The list of people, organisations and events that can fairly be blamed for the current crisis is long, and the report by former business leader Adair Turner, rakes over many of the old coals. </p> <p>There is the stock market boom of the 90s, which experts should have known was unsustainable. Companies which took pension contribution \"holidays\" are also culprits. They gave the cash to directors and shareholders and left their funds vulnerable to a stock market crash, which duly happened. Personal pension mis-selling further undermined our wish to save. </p> <p>Saving also took a knock following the government's reliance on means-tested benefits, which can be claimed by anyone with a pension pot worth less than about \u00a350,000. When the average one is worth around \u00a335,000, many experts argue that means-tested benefits have been a significant deterrent to saving. </p> <p>More importantly Mr Turner paints a bleak picture of the future. Life expectancy, he says, is likely to rise faster than government estimates. That may be good for those of us who live into our 80s and 90s, but it will mean stretching dwindling investment returns over a longer period. </p> <p>He says to avoid pensioner poverty we will need to work past 65 years old. But that won't be enough. We will need to save more, possibly making contributions compulsory. If we do all three, he argues, the impact of each can be lessened. If we start to make adjustments now we can also ease the pain. </p> <p>Our case studies below and opposite show how the pensions crisis will affect people of different ages and occupations. In Sweden, they have bitten the bullet and shifted to a system with high contributions, longer working and lower retirement income. They achieved some consensus on the way forward. Hopefully we can, too. </p> <p><strong>Case studies</strong></p> <p><strong>Office worker. aged 25</strong><br> Liz is an officer worker, 25, who left school at 18 for a clerical job in a large insurance company.</p> <p><strong> Her finances: </strong> She earns \u00a314,000. She pays 6% of her salary into a money purchase pension. Her employer matches her contribution with another 6%. She has no debts, but wants to buy a house and expects to start a family within the next five years. So while her outgoings are currently low, she expects them to rise dramatically in the near future as she and her husband acquire a mortgage and children. </p> <p> <strong> What if she does nothing? </strong> She should be fine. If her pension fund continues to enjoy a contribution rate of 12% until she is 65 then she will retire on a pension worth two-thirds of her last paycheck. That's the equivalent of a traditional final salary pension which usually guarantees to pay two-thirds of final salary as a retirement income (some only guarantee to pay half). </p> <p>Why? Mainly because she will have saved for so long. Forty-seven years is a long time to save for retirement. She will have paid nearly \u00a340,000 over that period, in addition to the \u00a340,000 contributed by her employer with full tax relief at 22p in the \u00a31. There is a difference with the final salary scheme and that is Liz must live with an investment risk. </p> <p>Her pension figures are based on average investment growth of 6%. It might seem like a conservative figure compared with the projected growth rates of 12% and 14% in the 90s, but 6% growth hasn't happened for the past few years. In fact the opposite is true and many money purchase occupational funds are in negative territory with much ground to make up before they can register 6% average growth. </p> <p> <strong> If she wants to do more: </strong> Don't bother, despite the crisis. With extra costs on the horizon, Liz should put any extra cash in an Isa, which could be used for a deposit on a house. Rainy day money could be put in a high interest savings account. </p> <p><strong>Secondary school teacher, 30</strong><br> Peter, 30, is the deputy head of geography at his local secondary school.</p> <p><strong> His finances: </strong> Peter has been a teacher since leaving college. As far as his pension is concerned, he is the target of resentment from right wing commentators who argue his retirement has been feather-bedded with a gold-plated final salary scheme. </p> <p>From one perspective he is protected from the investment ups and downs most workers cope with. The teachers' pension scheme for England and Wales - the second largest in the country, with 1.2m members - is calculated on a teacher's earnings in the years before retirement and the number of years in the plan. </p> <p>The scheme won't go bust and if he leaves the profession and returns, it allows him to buy back lost years. His employer puts in 13.5%, a figure much higher than most occupational schemes. </p> <p>But with a personal contribution rate of 6% he is not doing as well as his civil servant counterparts, many of whom enjoy a non-contributory pension. And his pension reaches a maximum value equivalent to half his final salary, putting him well behind a company director in a scheme paying two-thirds final salary. </p> <p> <strong> What if he does nothing? </strong> By today's standards he won't be in clover, but when he retires at 60 (though this will almost certainly rise to 65) he will be ahead of the pack. Private sector workers will be retiring on relatively small pensions, making him and other public sector workers relatively comfortable. </p> <p> <strong> If he wants to do more: </strong> He can buy additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). The union recommendation is to buy them from Prudential. Jobs &amp; Money has highlighted potential mis-selling cases where teachers have been advised to buy AVCs when they would have been better off buying back lost years. But Robert is a lifer and could benefit from AVCs. </p> <p><strong>Part-time aromatherapist, 35</strong> <br> Sandra, 35, is a part-time aromatherapist. She left college for a career in the media, but after a few dead-end jobs Sandra decided to embrace complementary health.</p> <p><strong> Her finances:</strong> Sandra's aromatherapy sessions pay well, but her annual income (\u00a39,000) is low because she only works two days a week. The rest of the time she looks after her young daughter. She has never had a pension and is concerned that she can't afford one without making significant sacrifices.Her national insurance contributions are also in arrears.</p> <p>Her partner has only recently begun to earn good money (\u00a330,000) after several years of travelling.</p> <p><strong>What if she does nothing?</strong> The pension situation looks far from rosy. Sandra must be assuming that her husband's company pension will provide a decent income. </p> <p>If she was single, she would be having to rely on the state in her old age for everything. At the moment she would qualify for the basic state pension of \u00a379.60 a week for a single person, probably boosted to \u00a3105 under the minimum income guarantee. </p> <p>At least she knows that under recent divorce law reforms she can obtain a part of his pension if they ever split up. </p> <p><strong>If she wants to do more:</strong> The situation still looks bleak. If, for instance, Sandra started to put 10% of her income into a stakeholder pension, she would retire at 65 with a retirement income worth 29% of her final income. That's \u00a32,500 a year at today's prices or nearly \u00a350 a week.</p> <p>Unfortunately she will only be marginally better off than someone who hasn't saved at all as her pension credit would be reduced by means-testing. Most financial advisers would advise her not too bother and instead to put savings in a tax-free Isa.</p> <p><strong>Pharmaceutical company manager, 40</strong><br> Robert, 40, is a senior manager earning \u00a345,000 at a pharmaceutical firm.</p> <p><strong> His finances: </strong> Robert enjoys the benefits of a final salary scheme. It offers a guarantee that if he works for 40 years he will receive a retirement income worth two thirds of his final salary. Some final salary schemes, often known as defined benefit schemes, only promise half of a workers final salary, but Robert's is at the more generous end. At one time, Marks &amp; Spencer went further and offered two thirds of final salary after 30 years service. </p> <p>If Robert retired on his current salary, he would enjoy an income of \u00a330,000 a year. But he is ambitious. He is expecting a promotion soon to director level and within the next 10 years expects to breach the \u00a3100,000-a-year barrier. He might even make it to the company board and start raking in some serious money. </p> <p> <strong> What if he does nothing? </strong> He will be sitting pretty. As long as his company doesn't go bust before next April when a government protection scheme comes into force for occupational schemes, he will be able to take several holidays a year for what might be 20 or more years of retirement. </p> <p> <strong> What if he wants more? </strong> He shouldn't need any more, but if he does there are ways. He could take the conventional route and put any extra cash in a tax-free Isa. </p> <p>If he joins the board he could look forward to another bonus - early retirement. Most FTSE 100 companies have schemes that allow executives to accumulate their 40 years' service at an accelerated rate. It means he doesn't need to work a whole year to acquire a year's worth of pensionable service. Companies such as oil firm BP and B&amp;Q, owner Kingfisher, are renowned for accelerating the pension benefits of senior directors. Robert will face a new tax on his pension fund if it exceeds \u00a31.5m after April 2006, but if his company is willing to pay the tax for him he will escape unscathed with a pension in excess of \u00a3100,000.</p> <p><strong>National publication journalist, 50</strong><br> Heather, 50, earns \u00a350,000 a year as a deputy editor on a high circulation weekly women's magazine. </p> <p><strong> Her finances: </strong> Heather has recently joined her company pension scheme after years of telling her friends she is unlikely to reach retirement. </p> <p>A heavy smoker and drinker, over the years she has spent everything she earned. Still single, Heather recently panicked that she might live beyond 65 and find herself alone and at the mercy of the state. </p> <p>Her company pays 8% into her pension while she pays 8%. </p> <p> <strong> What if she does nothing? </strong> If Heather just sits tight (excuse the pun) she will retire on \u00a311,900 in today's money, says financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown, which offers a free pension fund calculator (ring 0845-330-4816). Despite her high salary and relatively high combined contribution rate of 16%, her pension amounts to only 24% of her pre-retirement income. Even when it is coupled with her state pension, it won't buy a fancy lifestyle. </p> <p>She left it too late. Not that she had many options. None of her former employers offered her an occupational pension. </p> <p>All companies now have to offer a stakeholder pension but most make no contribution and few have any members. </p> <p>If she had started her own personal pension the situation might be only marginally better. Much of her contributions in the early years would have been eaten up in charges and the bear market would have sent her fund spiralling downwards. </p> <p><strong> If she wants to do more: </strong> Tom McPhail, pensions expert at Hargreaves Lansdown says she can increase her contributions but is currently restricted to buying additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). If she put another 7% a year into an AVC (the maximum under current rules) her pension would rise to \u00a317,122. </p> <p>She is prevented from starting a stakeholder until after April 2006, when rule changes will allow her to make contributions of up to 100% of her income to make up for lost time.</p>",

Remember, all of this is subjective: we assume no responsibility for agony in the changing room. </p> <p><strong>Whistles</strong>,<strong> Next</strong> and <strong>Oasis</strong> trousers are good for big bums, plus (some claim) <strong>agn\u00e8s b</strong>. Older women might check out <strong>Sonia Rykiel</strong> and <strong>East</strong>. <strong>Principles</strong> is flattering for pear-shaped bodies, apparently. For flabby tummies, head for <strong>Petit Bateau</strong>'s women's T-shirts (020-7228 7233, <a href=\"http://www.petit-bateau.com\">petit-bateau.com</a>). <strong>Calvin Klein</strong> jeans (at department stores), <strong>Whistles</strong> occasionally and <strong>Jigsaw</strong> in general can be friendly to flabby tummies. <strong>Missoni</strong>, <strong>Ghost</strong> (the designer also works for M&amp;S, so Ghost-type dresses available there, too), <strong>L K Bennett</strong> and <strong>Marella</strong> are said to be good for all kinds of curviness, although at least one other participant in our poll thought the shiny drapiness of Ghost clothes made women look twice their size. For jeans, try <strong>Gap</strong>, and <strong>Donna Karan/DKNY/DKNY Jeans</strong> were said to be more generous in the cut. For slimmer, less curvy women, <strong>French Connection</strong> trousers are well cut, and <strong>All Saints</strong> fitted jackets were recommended as \"figure hugging and suggestive of curve\". A posse of petite women suggest children's clothes from <strong>Woolworths</strong>, <strong>Jigsaw kids</strong>, <strong>DKNY kids</strong> and <strong>Gap Kids</strong>, or for a more adult approach <strong>Carhartt</strong>, <strong>Hennes</strong>,<strong> Topshop</strong> and <strong>Miss Sixty</strong>. European labels such as <strong>Kookai</strong>,<strong> Morgan</strong>,<strong> Benetton</strong> and<strong> Sisley</strong> are slim-fitting. <strong>Monsoon</strong> is also believed to be good for trousers for small women. <strong>Joseph</strong>,<strong> Escada</strong>,<strong> Zara</strong> and <strong>Topshop</strong> (again) can be good for long-legged women. </p> <p>For the final word on personal style, we turned to Dean Aslett, head of personal shopping at Selfridges: he offered the following tips. \"Your underwear is the place to start: <strong>Wacaol</strong>, stocked by Selfridges among other places, does fantastic undergarments with corsetry, boning, brilliantly shaped to pull you in on thighs, bum, belly or breasts. It doesn't look particularly glamorous, but it does the job. From this season's looks, the cigarette pant is marvellous for larger thighs and bums: <strong>Joseph</strong> and <strong>Whistles</strong> are both doing great versions. And I never understand why women with bigger bums always want to cover them up: I think this season's chopped-off Chanel jacket (Joseph is doing a good version) is very flattering for a large bottom. <strong>Diane von Furstenberg</strong> is really good for curvy shapes, while <strong>Ronit Zilkha's</strong> lines are cut wonderfully for larger ladies, and are slightly more affordable than some of our designers. Jeans are complicated because everyone is a different shape, but the labels that are always popular are <strong>Armani</strong>, <strong>Seven</strong> and the LA brands <strong>Juicy</strong>, <strong>True Believer</strong> and <strong>von Dutch</strong>. Collezione Armani produces, without doubt, the best little black dresses for anyone who doesn't feel up to a skimpy thing with spaghetti straps, and it goes up to size 16: there are also a couple of dresses in wonderful sooty jersey and matt crepe de chine, long-sleeved, great fluted shapes that would look good on anyone (price: \u00a3560). But, actually, you can't fault Topshop: it's doing some great A-line wrap skirts this winter.\" </p> <p><strong>Alterations, dressmakers and DIY</strong><br> </p> <p>Don't forget the simple option of making a few alterations: taking trousers up, or - if there's sufficient hem - down, tightening or loosening waistbands, shortening sleeves. Shops such as <strong>Joseph</strong> or <strong>Nicole Farhi</strong> offer in-house alterations for a small charge. Your nearest dry cleaner may well do alterations, or know somewhere reliable. The next rung on the DIY ladder is getting a dressmaker to run something up for you. There doesn't seem to be an umbrella organisation for dressmakers, but you can get a list from <strong>Sew Direct</strong> (0870 777 9966, <a href=\"http://www.sewdirect.com\">sewdirect.com</a>) for \u00a31 </p> <p><strong>Profiles</strong></p> <p><strong>Elephant Feet</strong><br></p> <p>At school, Emeka Egemonye had to get special permission to wear army boots. At 14, his feet were already size 14: 'The only shoes that fitted were the same ones my father bought: you can imagine how that feels for a teenage boy.' </p> <p>He set off to study business at Boston University, and for a few years his problems were solved. 'Americans are averagely above average - you can get big shoes there. But when I moved back to the UK, it all started again. There are a few firms that do outsize shoes, but they don't do anything fashionable. After I'd bought the same pair of shoes four times, I thought, something has to be done.' So, in 2000, Elephant Feet was born, in a corner of a friend's shop in Brixton. Egemonye spent months contacting all the shoe firms he could think of, trekking around shoe fairs in Las Vegas, Milan, Berlin, just to hunt down the few makers who would be able to help. From the moment he opened, the response was fantastic. 'Word got around incredibly fast: tall men all know other tall men. Long before I opened the shop, I'd go up to other tall men on the street and ask where they got their shoes.' After a couple of months, he branched into women's shoes, then into his own shop. Now he designs a large part of his range. </p> <p>His customers come from far and wide, some visiting twice a year and buying 10 pairs at a time. Egemonye, 38, has just opened a second shop in central London, and hopes to expand around the country. 'Most buyers in this trade don't have outsize feet. But I know what people have been through; I love the look on their faces when they come through the door and see the shoes. It gives me joy.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Elephant Feet, 63 Atlantic Road, London SW9, 020-7346 8916, and 8 Chiltern Street, London W1, 020-7486 2086 (<a href=\"http://www.elephantfeet.com\">elephantfeet.com</a>). </p> <p><strong>Anna Scholz</strong></p> <p>'I've known some of the most beautiful women in the world,' says Anna Scholz, 'and they're convinced that they've got sagging bottoms, or that they're flat-chested.' </p> <p>She describes herself as 'chubby' from early on: Scholz's family, in Hamburg, were loving but made it clear that they wished she were thinner. 'The odd thing was, I didn't feel bad about myself.' At 13, she began to make clothes for herself, and then at 16 she was discovered as a plus-size model while dancing at a party. 'I could not believe the hideousness of the things they were asking me to wear.' Now 36, she looks through her old portfolio and laughs: Scholz is a radiantly beautiful woman, but here we have her in polka dots, here in huge shoulder pads, here in flat shoes and headscarfs. </p> <p>'I knew I could look sexy,' she says, 'but I always ended up looking mumsy, in big prints, as if the designers believed I should be in camouflage.' She had never stopped looking around for good plus-size clothes while travelling for work, 'but there was just nothing. Anywhere.' </p> <p>So Scholz decided to concentrate on her own designs and began at St Martins in London in 1990. She does not appear to have stopped working since. 'I feel like an agony aunt sometimes, instead of a designer,' says Scholz. 'Women write to me saying they feel confident and sexy for the first time in their lives. I love the fact that there are 80-year-olds out there wearing my embroidered T-shirts. Clothes should make you feel good. It's that simple.' </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Anna Scholz is stocked in Harrods, 87-135 Brompton Road, London SW1, 020-7730 1234, and Selfridges, 400 Oxford Street, London W1, 0870 837 7377.

Gaynor Wisdom and Clare Thomas, both in their 30s, met when Wisdom was designing a website for Thomas's business. But they bonded over their bottoms. 'We wanted to see if there was anyone out there designing specifically for a pear shape,' says Thomas. 'Seventy per cent of women are pear-shaped, but there don't seem to be any clothes that are made for us - everything's all gaping waists and tight around the hips.' </p> <p>They realised that thousands of women - pear- or apple-shaped, tall or short, big-busted, plus-sized, post-mastectomy - were not what shops consider 'normal'. So Wisdom and Thomas decided to create Uniquely Woman, a UK resource for hard-to-find women's clothing, launched in February, which features a database and messageboards. 'It became an obsession - I would have breakfast at the computer,' Wisdom says, 'and be up till the small hours searching.' The database now has listings of more than 1,000 UK suppliers. The website still does not pay for itself - it is, as the two women admit, a labour of love. Every day, however, a few hundred women log on and search for the clothes that will be right for them. </p> <p>And those designs for pear-shaped women? Still no sign - which, as they readily admit, is a source of some disappointment, to both them and their customers. 'We can only tell people what is out there. We don't manufacture or supply clothes ourselves,' says Wisdom. 'That's the logical next step.'

  "<p><strong>Tall/petite women</strong><br> </p> <p>Although options for tall women are still limited, they do exist. As for petite women, styles for children and teenagers have caught up with adult fashion to such an extent that there's no excuse for not dressing well. Marni, DKNY, Ralph Lauren, Paul Smith, Maharishi, Diesel and Tommy Hilfiger are among the designers now doing kids' collections, many of which go up to age 18 and are cheaper than the adult ranges: if you're in London, head for the Harrods teen department. </p> <p>The <strong>Additions</strong> catalogue (0845 304 0008, <a href=\"http://www.additionsdirect.co.uk\">additionsdirect.co.uk</a>) carries fashionable, inexpensive tall/petite ranges. <strong>Country Casuals</strong> (01845 573120, <a href=\"http://www.countrycasuals.co.uk\">countrycasuals.co.uk</a>) does a feminine range of clothes for petite women. <strong>Dorothy Perkins</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.dorothyperkins.co.uk\">dorothyperkins.co.uk</a>) sells one of the best tall or petite ranges: very inexpensive. <strong>Topshop</strong> (0800 731 8284) also offers good tall and petite collections. <strong>Gap</strong> sizes are helpful: its trousers and jeans come in ankle, regular and tall (0800 427789). <strong>Liz Label</strong> (0845 123 2736, <a href=\"http://www.lizlabel.co.uk\">lizlabel.co.uk</a>) is a small website selling a few really nice things. <strong>Long Tall Sally</strong> (0870 990 6885, <a href=\"http://www.longtallsally.com\">longtallsally.com</a>) has stores nationwide, and a huge range online. <strong>Miory</strong> (0845 056 3545, <a href=\"http://www.miory.co.uk\">miory.co.uk</a>) has just launched: it's making really sharp trouser suits at very good prices for tall women, and plans to extend the range. <strong>Tall Girls</strong> (01420 587400, <a href=\"http://www.tallgirls.co.uk\">tallgirls.co.uk</a>) is an online boutique that sells up-to-date clothes and shoes at reasonable prices. Youthful stuff. </p> <p><strong>Plus-size for women</strong><br> </p> <p>Most high-street stores go up to 16, and plenty more offer plus-size ranges. There are also a few good shops and catalogues making clothes specifically for size 16 and above. </p> <p>On the high street, <strong>Evans</strong> (0800 731 8287, <a href=\"http://www.evans.ltd.uk\">evans.ltd.uk</a>) is mid-transformation: its trendier Seven range was such a success that it's overhauling the whole chain. This autumn, expect tweeds and vintagey dressed-up clothes. <strong>Elvi</strong> (01527 506306, <a href=\"http://www.elvi.co.uk\">elvi.co.uk</a>) does breezy young styles in size 16 and up - more Debenhams than Topshop. <strong>Size Up</strong> (0800 085 6540, <a href=\"http://www.sizeup.co.uk\">sizeup.co.uk</a>) opened its first shop in 1997 and has 33 stores nationwide and an impressive online catalogue.

It has Chinese prints, some Victorian detail tops: pretty, up-to-date stuff. <strong>Pinc Clothing</strong> (01685 878798, <a href=\"http://www.pincclothing.co.uk\">pincclothing.co.uk</a>) is a Welsh shop and online catalogue doing well-priced, trendy clothes for the plus-size woman, but it's a mixed bag. <strong>Size Appeal</strong> (001 866 627 7325, <a href=\"http://www.sizeappeal.com\">sizeappeal.com</a>) is an American catalogue that breaks loads of rules: it offers boob tubes, slashed skirts and halter necks. <strong>Torrid</strong> (001 626 839 4681, <a href=\"http://www.torrid.com\">torrid.com</a>) is another American site making what it describes as \"teen-style, plus-size clothes\". <strong>Lands' End</strong> (0800 376 7974, <a href=\"http://www.landsend.co.uk\">landsend.co.uk</a>) has an extensive plus-size collection, and a limited range for tall customers. Another good online catalogue is <strong>Look Again</strong> (0870 605 5666, <a href=\"http://www.lookagain.co.uk\">lookagain.co.uk</a>) which has a good Plus Collection in simple lines and colours. Most items in the <strong>Boden</strong> catalogue (0845 677 5000, <a href=\"http://www.boden.co.uk\">boden.co.uk</a>) go up to a 20. </p> <p>When it comes to designers, things are finally getting lively: <strong>Anna Scholz</strong> (020-8964 3040, <a href=\"http://www.annascholz.com\">annascholz.com</a>) is probably the most interesting designer working in plus-size fashion. <strong>Elena Miro</strong> (020-7734 1333, <a href=\"http://www.elenamiro.com\">elenamiro.com</a>) offers an Italian line in plums, olives, lots of sequins and suede, which goes up to 28, and is stocked by Harrods, Dickins &amp; Jones, DH Evans and its own store (all London, plus Rackhams in Birmingham). <strong>Eskandar</strong> (020-7351 7333) is the Nicole Farhi of the plus-size world: very expensive and stylish. <strong>Marina Rinaldi</strong> (020-7629 4454) is a long-established plus-size designer: again it's a very classic Italian look. <strong>Harrods</strong> (020-7730 1234, <a href=\"http://www.harrods.co.uk\">harrods.co.uk</a>) has the best known Plus Collections department, which carries ranges by <strong>Elena Miro</strong>, <strong>Marina Rinaldi</strong>, <strong>Gianfranco Ferre</strong> (black leather, black and white tweed), <strong>Persona</strong> and <strong>Anna Scholz</strong>. For a more mature, classic look, <strong>Artigiano</strong> (01983 531000, <a href=\"http://www.artigiano.co.uk\">artigiano.co.uk</a>) has two great catalogues (Artigiano for sizes 10-20 and Spirito for 18-30). Neither is cutting-edge, but full of Italian-style classics. <strong>Base</strong> (020-7240 8914, <a href=\"http://www.base-fashions.co.uk\">base-fashions.co.uk</a>) is an independent store in London that carries a range of European labels in sizes 16-28. <strong>Simply Be</strong> (0870 160 6100, <a href=\"http://www.simplybe.co.uk\">simplybe.co.uk</a>) is the best of a whole raft of catalogues offering middle-of-the-road clothes at middle-of-the-road prices. <strong>French and Teague</strong> (020-7255 2266, <a href=\"http://www.sixteen47.com\">sixteen47.com</a>) is Dawn French and Helen Teague's label, which basically follows all the traditional rules about clothes for plus-size women: think camouflage and tents. It's fairly expensive, though better cut than cheaper versions. For eveningwear, <strong>Berkswell</strong> (01676 533940, <a href=\"http://www.berkswelldirect.com\">berkswelldirect.com</a>) does made-to-measure ball gowns, starting at around \u00a3210. At <strong>Black Frock</strong> (07092 140361, <a href=\"http://www.blackfrock.com\">blackfrock.com</a>), you can design your own little black dress online, choosing neckline, sleeves and length, up to size 18, though the options aren't as exciting as you'd think. <strong>Vivi Direct</strong> (01824 790116, <a href=\"http://www.vivi-direct.com\">vivi-direct.com</a>) makes straightforward linen clothes up to a size 22. </p> <p><strong>Big breasts, small breasts, swimwear</strong><br> </p> <p>The booking agent at one plus-size model agency sends all her new girls straight to <strong>Rigby &amp; Peller</strong> (020-7514 9163, <a href=\"http://www.rigbyandpeller.com\">rigbyandpeller.com</a>) to get them properly measured: nothing, she insists, is more important than the right bra. The fitters at Rigby &amp; Peller (all in or around London, sorry) measure by eye, and are geniuses: the bras are expensive, but you'll often come out a whole new size. Bras go up to 48I. <strong>Bravissimo</strong> (01926 459859, <a href=\"http://www.bravissimo.com\">bravissimo.com</a>) has eight shops around the country, and is loved by all who have discovered it: it specialises in fuller cup sizes, and stocks beautiful bras from D to JJ that don't look like upholstery. It also sells underwired swimwear: stuff that under-30s will not sneer at. And last, but not least, it's come up with a solution to a problem that so many people complain about: gaping shirt buttons. Bravissimo offers two styles of top - a sleeveless one and a tailored shirt - in specific bust sizes, creating a better fit. There is a catalogue and online service. At <strong>Figleaves</strong> (0870 499 9000, <a href=\"http://www.figleaves.com\">figleaves.com</a>) sizes go up to a 56 back width and a JJ cup. Online sales. <strong>Heavenly Bodice</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.heavenlybodice.com\">heavenlybodice.com</a>) has a plus-size category that goes up to a JJ, and 56 back width, in some styles. Also features some swimwear. <strong>The Undercover Experience</strong> website (020-8293 5995, <a href=\"http://www.undercoverexperience.co.uk\">undercoverexperience.co.uk</a>) seems clunky and slow but is full of treasures. Bras go from AAA to L and up to a back width of 52. There's a huge range of swimwear, and cunning insert-type things for the less well-endowed. <strong>Aphrodisia</strong> (01892 523023, <a href=\"http://www.aphrodisiauk.com\">aphrodisiauk.com</a>) has bras up to 50FF, and swimwear with underwired cups. Those in search of boostage should check out <strong>Max Cleavage</strong> (0870 333 3904, <a href=\"http://www.maxcleavage.com\">maxcleavage.com</a>) which specialises in bust-enhancing bras and swimwear: it sells plunge bras, Max Pillows (silicone gel bra inserts), variable cleavage bras, the Maxistay-up (a strapless, backless, adhesive silicone bra that sort of sticks to your front), stick-on nipples and maxiflorals (nipple cover-uppers). You really had no idea. <strong>Ultimo</strong> (0845 130 3232, <a href=\"http://www.ultimodirect.com\">ultimodirect.com</a>), as modelled by Rachel Hunter, does the original gel bra and the Miracle Body (cunning body suit that can be worn under very low-cut fronts and backs, so that you still have a bit of support). Stocked by Selfridges, Debenhams and John Lewis. <strong>Less Bounce</strong> (08000 363840, <a href=\"http://www.lessbounce.com\">lessbounce.com</a>) specialises in sports bras from A to H cup, and from 30-53 back width. <strong>My Tights</strong> (020-8400 6270, <a href=\"http://www.mytights.com\">mytights.com</a>) does tights for tall/short/large/pregnant women. For swimwear it's also worth checking out the Lands' End online catalogue (<a href=\"http://www.landsend.co.uk\">landsend.co.uk</a>), which has good suggestions and styles for different body types. </p> <p><strong>Tall and/or broad men</strong><br> </p> <p>One of the men in our straw poll of ordinary shoppers described the menswear industry as nothing but \"flatulent, pin-headed, testosterone-pumped rugger-bugger design\" (he's not bitter). Although the high street is improving, on the whole there are two ways to go: specialist shops (and there aren't many of those) or tailoring. </p> <p>One of the few pieces of good news is <strong>Rochester Big and Tall </strong> (020-7838 0018), which has exclusive deals with designers such as Polo Ralph Lauren, DKNY, Calvin Klein, Versace, Ermenegildo Zegna and Canali for longer, broader clothes. Prices start reasonably but can go extremely high. Other specialists include <strong>Bigaclothing</strong> (0870 855 0614, <a href=\"http://www.bigaclothing.co.uk\">bigaclothing.co.uk</a>), an online men's catalogue going up to 8XL, which offers a couple of nice casual striped shirts. <strong>Big Ozzy</strong> (01969 625565, <a href=\"http://www.bigozzy.com\">bigozzy.com</a>) offers \"clothes for more than the average man\" - this is a family-run company that tries to provide slightly more fashionable looks for big men, including some great Hawaiian shirts, a couple of utility jackets and some nice linen numbers. <strong>High and Mighty</strong> (0845 601 0212, <a href=\"http://www.shop.highandmighty.co.uk\">highandmighty.co.uk</a> to find nearest store) is a nationwide chain that sells basic menswear. <strong>Eton Shirts</strong> (020-7430 1433, <a href=\"http://www.etonshirts.co.uk\">etonshirts.co.uk</a>) offers larger sizes and longer sleeves along with the main collection of very city gent shirts. Lands' End (0800 376 7974, <a href=\"http://www.landsend.co.uk\">landsend.co.uk</a>) has a tall section for men, while its tops go up to 48 chest size: all a bit preppy. <strong>Thomas Pink</strong> (020-7498 3882, <a href=\"http://www.thomaspink.co.uk\">thomaspink.co.uk</a>) shirts are recommended by one man who has particularly long arms. <strong>Solid Clothing</strong> (020-8979 5970, <a href=\"http://www.solidclothing.co.uk\">solidclothing.co.uk</a>) appears to sell clothes for men who lift weights. It goes up to 4XL and will make shirts to order. </p> <p><strong>Small men</strong><br> </p> <p>There aren't many options if you're small: one male fashion writer swears by women's jeans, and picks out Levi's as being particularly good. Children's clothes are not, apparently, much help: the cut for a teenage boy and a man are not tremendously compatible. In response to customer demand, <strong>Topman</strong> (0800 731 8284, <a href=\"http://www.topman.co.uk\">topman.co.uk</a>) now offers 28in trousers and 34in suit jackets, and goes down to XS in many of its fashion ranges. <strong>Hennes</strong> goes down to XS and <strong>Gap</strong> does an XXS in many lines. <strong>APC</strong> (stocked in Selfridges, Harrods and Harvey Nichols, <a href=\"http://www.apc.fr\">apc.fr</a>) jackets are very slim-fitting. </p> <p><strong>Tailor-made for men</strong><br> </p> <p>Tailor-to-the-stars Nick Tentis has some useful advice for anyone going this route: \"The best way to find someone good near you is by recommendation - just ask everyone you know, especially if they wear nice suits. What seems to happen a lot is that you go in, describe what you want, and they nod and smile and then just make the same suit that they always make. Be very specific: tear pictures out of magazines to give them a really clear idea. Make sure they give you lots of fittings, that's really important if you want exactly the right fit. If you buy a cheap suit, don't expect too much: you're going to get plastic buttons, cheap linings and cheap fabric.\" </p> <p>Tentis's own suits start at \u00a3550: that's ready-to-wear, but his workshop will do all kinds of alterations. A semi-bespoke Tentis suit goes for about \u00a31,400, and fully bespoke for around \u00a32,000 (Nick Tentis, 020-7355 3399: happy to offer further advice over the phone). <strong>Austin Reed</strong> (020-7734 6789, <a href=\"http://www.austinreed.co.uk\">austinreed.co.uk</a>) offers a personal tailoring service at many stores: one participant in our poll, who was bewailing his \"unusually fat thighs\", found Austin Reed invaluable. It also has a special order shirt service. <strong>Burton</strong> (0870 122 8804, <a href=\"http://www.burton.co.uk\">burton.co.uk</a>) offers a made-to-measure service from \u00a3220. Its ready-to-wear goes up to 48in regular and 46in long in jackets, with trousers available up to 42in waist. <strong>Exact Personal Tailoring</strong> (01789 205612, <a href=\"http://www.exacttailoring.com\">exacttailoring.com</a>) is a handy website that will make shirts, trousers, even boxer shorts, to your measurements. Just fill in your specifications on the order form and choose from dozens of fabrics - shirts start at \u00a334.95, trousers at about \u00a370. There are options for women, too. <strong>Hackett</strong> (020-7819 6800, <a href=\"http://www.hackett.co.uk\">hackett.co.uk</a>) can alter and tailor for any frame. <strong>Mangas</strong> (020-7638 7377, <a href=\"http://www.mangas.co.uk\">mangas.co.uk</a>) does made-to-measure suits from \u00a3289. Bespoke suits on Savile Row start at about \u00a32,000: this really is the luxury end of the market.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,3605,1328078,00.html\">Read part two here</a></p>"
