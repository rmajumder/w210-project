  "<p>Gary Speed is experiencing a depth of culture shock not normally associated with crossing the Pennines. After nearly two decades as a professional footballer the midfielder has just swapped Newcastle for Bolton, a club that could be straight out of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. </p> <p>Like all Sam Allardyce's recruits Speed has already been assessed by the club's psychological profiler - there is a story doing the rounds at the Reebok that one potential summer signing was vetoed because his psychological profile did not fit the Bolton blueprint - sat through hours of motivational videos and had his every physiological function monitored by Allardyce's army of sports scientists. </p> <p>Bolton's doctor of oriental medicine may have been dispensed with but laptops remain de rigueur coaching accessories for Allardyce's staff and Speed is still blinking in amazement. </p> <p>\"It's all a bit different from Newcastle and all very thorough,\" said the Wales captain, who is approaching his 35th birthday and has played a record 414 Premiership games - for Leeds, Everton and Newcastle. </p> <p>\"I've never even worked with a psychologist before but I'm not too old to open my eyes and take new things on board. Training is extremely intense here and we work most afternoons as well as mornings. </p> <p>\"But doing things like Tai Chi is brilliant and, if everything Sam tries makes us just half a per cent better on the pitch, it will be fully worthwhile. Bolton finished eighth in the Premiership last season and reached the League Cup final, so getting eighth again is the minimum we are looking to achieve this time.\" </p> <p>Until a few weeks ago Speed's aim had been to help Newcastle finish a minimum of fourth but then came the bombshell that Leeds wanted to sign Speed and Sir Bobby Robson was happy for him to talk to his old club. </p> <p>Speed, who has signed a two-year contract with Bolton, did not want to drop out of the Premiership and rebuffed Leeds but he knew his six-year Tyneside sojourn was effectively over. </p> <p>\"I didn't want to leave but I knew my time was up, that I had no future there,\" explained a man who, like the similarly departed Rob Lee and Nolberto Solano, was once hailed by Robson as \"part of my blue-chip brigade\". </p> <p>The initial hurt was tinged with puzzlement. \"The strange thing was I just hadn't seen it coming,\" admitted Speed, who still speaks to Alan Shearer, one of his closest friends, several times a week. \"I'd played every game last season, more than any other Newcastle player, and I never imagined I wouldn't be staying. But towards the end the manager and the chairman were totally straight up front with me and we parted on good terms.\" </p> <p>Even so, did Speed concur with the Tyneside conspiracy theorists who suspect his sale was part of a wider plan to weaken Shearer's dressing-room power base? \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said, stone-walling before allowing himself a mischievous giggle. </p> <p>\"There's no hard-luck stories in the Premiership and I don't know where Newcastle will finish this season; I don't want to comment on that but I do know their supporters deserve some success. I've so many friends up there and no one would be more delighted than me if they won something.\" </p> <p>A source of delight for the new Boltonian has been the realisation that he is far from the senior citizen among Allardyce's squad. \"It makes a nice change not to be the oldest; there's three or four older than me here.\" </p> <p>They include his fellow newcomers Les Ferdinand, 37, and Fernando Hierro, 36, who spent last season in Qatar after being moved on by Real Madrid. Evidently swayed by the Welshman's comparative youth Allardyce is planning to turn back the clock and reinvent Speed as the attacking midfielder he was before Robson asked him to sit in front of Newcastle's defence. </p> <p>\"We've got Iv\u00e1n Campo sitting in that deep position I had in the latter years at Newcastle so, with the manager also preferring to play 4-3-3, he's asked me if I'd play a new role, get forward a lot more and hopefully score a few goals,\" said Speed. \"I don't want to put too much pressure on myself but it's something I used to do a lot earlier in my career and I still feel fit enough to get myself into the box and try and score my share.\" </p> <p>Remarkably the longest Speed has been sidelined with injuries during his near 20-year career is two six-week stints, one after suffering a broken cheekbone and the other following a double-hernia operation. </p> <p>\"I do go out and enjoy myself but I've also always looked after myself. Luck plays a part but, as I've got older, I've done absolutely everything I can to avoid getting muscular injuries which, in your 30s, take time to recover from,\" explained a man who regularly supplemented Newcastle's official training regime with runs and cycle rides through the Northumberland countryside. </p> <p>Small wonder Speed's psychological profile apparently made such pleasant reading for his new manager. Or, as Allardyce translated it into layman's terms: \"Gary is one of those rare players you know you can hang your hat on.\" </p> <p><strong>New Age Trotters: analysing the Allardyce system</strong></p> <p><strong> Psychological profiler</strong> </p> <p>Assesses all potential new recruits before signing and compiles a profile enabling Allardyce to know how best to man-manage individuals and how they are likely to react to differing situations. </p> <p><strong> Tai Chi</strong> </p> <p>Bolton's doctor of Oriental medicine has been dispensed with for this season but eastern influences remain. Players seem to particularly enjoy Tai Chi, claiming it helps them control anger, channel energy in a positive fashion and is a good way of relaxing while performing beneficial muscle stretches. </p> <p><strong> Motorised toilet seat racing</strong> </p> <p>By way of team bonding Allardyce has been known to take his squad to the Lake District for mini-breaks where racing down a fell side on specially motorised toilet seats is de rigueur . </p> <p><strong> Fitness training</strong> </p> <p>Allardyce insists the Premiership \"is the most physically demanding league in the world\" and fitness experts supplement training with a tough regimen that incorporates separate assessments and tailor-made programmes for individual players. </p> <p><strong> Prozone</strong> </p> <p>You cannot cheat the computerised information that, with detailed analysis of a filmed match, tells Bolton's staff exactly how far each player has run during a game, how many positive passes they have made, how many tackles they have shirked etc. Players love it or loathe it, but it is regarded as an invaluable aid as many will not admit to their faults until confronted with them on the Prozone screen. Helps Allardyce shape his tactics and select personnel. </p> <p><strong> Laptops</strong> </p> <p>Obligatory tools for Bolton staff. Allardyce spends hours surfing the internet looking for new sports science innovations and takes a keen interest in training developments in other sports. All data on Bolton players is logged on computer so coaches can call up information at touch of a button. Staff regularly communicate my email. </p> <p><strong> Motivational videos</strong> </p> <p>Bolton players probably spend more time watching these than sitting through The Tweenies with their toddlers. </p> <p><strong> Nutritionist</strong> </p> <p>Devises specific diets for individuals and advises Allardyce on how players should best ensure they benefit from maximum energy during a match. </p> <p><strong> Chinese meals</strong> </p> <p>A more old-fashioned aid; Allardyce is not averse to bolstering harmony during a night out with his squad who are, as a special treat, permitted to rehydrate with lager.</p>",
  "<p>The timetable for the float of Google, valuing the net search engine at up to \u00a320bn, could be temporarily derailed after it admitted it may have illegally issued shares to employees and consultants. </p> <p>There were additional reports in the US last night that the initial public offering had been delayed by a week due to separate logistical problems with the complicated auction of shares being used. </p> <p>The Wall Street Journal said the process for registering bidders for the \"Dutch auction\" was taking longer than anticipated, pushing it back to the traditionally lean late August period. The company did not comment. </p> <p>In a routine filing with the US securities and exchange commission, Google earlier said it had sold 23.2m shares worth up to $3.1bn (\u00a31.7bn) to 1,105 consultants and former staff. It has also issued 5.6m stock options to 301 people. </p> <p>The transactions, made over the past three years, were not registered as required by law. Google has offered to buy back the shares for $25.9m but has warned that some stockholders may prefer to sue rather than accept the offer. </p> <p>The offer will expire in September, it said, and those who did not respond would have their shares automatically registered following the float, which is due to take place as soon as next week. </p> <p>Google said it may have broken federal laws and those of 18 states and the District of Columbia by failing to register the stock and options or exempt them from registration. </p> <p>The company, which handles more than 200m searches a day, is in a closed period prior to the float, and it was not clear whether the timing would be affected. In the filing, it said it planned to conduct the float \"as soon as is practicable\". </p> <p>It is using the \"Dutch auction\" process in an effort to democratise the float. Google and its underwriters, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley, will determine the highest price at which there is demand for all the shares and price the stock at or below that level.</p>",
  "<p>Solicitors representing the woman at the centre of the FA sex scandal warned newspapers today that papers related to Faria Alam had gone missing and they would seek to injunct any paper that threatened to reveal the confidential information.</p> <p>But within an hour the solicitors admitted that the papers had been recovered and they had just taken an \"extra precautionary measure\" by issuing a warning to newspapers.</p> <p>\"The papers have been safely retrieved, there is no story,\" said her solicitor, Steven Barker, of criminal law firm Barker Gillette.</p> <p>Ms Alam yesterday resigned from the Football Association and has sold her story to two Sunday newspapers - the News of the World and the Mail on Sunday - in a deal worth around \u00a3400,000.

  "Come August and the Indonesian papers face the same difficulties as those in Britain: deciding what constitutes news when little is happening. The result is that every paper has been splashing with different stories, as demonstrated by yesterday's editions. <p>\"Golkar leaders fighting for crumbs\", was the lead in <b>Rakyat Merdeka</b>, after the largest party in parliament saw its candidate defeated in the first round of the country's first direct presidential election. </p> <p>\"Hundreds of legislators-elect have problems\", was <b>Koran Tempo</b>'s preference, in an article that discussed the legal difficulties facing members of provincial and district councils, and the national parliament. </p> <p>\"Government sees limited oil-hike impact\", was the duller choice of the English-language <b>Jakarta Post</b>'s newly appointed editor, although that was brightened by an unrelated photo underneath of a full washing line - the country's longest, at 2.4 miles. </p> <p><b>Republika</b>, a newspaper whose owner is the campaign manager of President Megawati Sukarnoputri's closest rival in the elections, used a quiet day to have another go at Ms Megawati, accusing her and her running mate of refusing to admit accepting illegal campaign contributions. </p> <p><b>Kompas</b>, the nation's most widely read broadsheet, told its readers: \"Bosses pay for processing of Indonesian workers' documents\". The story covered the impending crackdown by Malaysian authorities on illegal foreign workers. Malaysian plantation workers are hastily \"legalising\" their workers to escape sanction. </p> <p>Perhaps the only consistent newspaper was the capital's leading tabloid, <b>City Post</b>, which stuck to its usual fare with the following: \"After angering her foster mother, young orphan girl is burnt\". The strap underneath read: \"Enraged mob try to destroy the foster home\". </p> <p>The weeklies, however, were all on the same page, playing catch-up on the previous big story, the constitutional court's decision to deem as invalid the prosecutions of the perpetrators of the Bali bombing in 2002, because they were conducted under a piece of legislation enacted after the atrocity. \"Will they go free?\" was <b>Tempo</b>'s simple headline, above photos of four of the ringleaders. </p> <p>The inside pages of the papers, too, were concentrating on some of the same stories. One is the murder of Amanda Devina, a 22-year-old student at one of Jakarta's more prestigious private universities. What made this case unique for Indonesia was the double life the woman, who had committed what is - in the eyes of many Indonesians - the sin of becoming pregnant outside marriage. She paid for it with her life. </p> <p>In a leader headlined \"Amanda is a portrait of our society\", the conservative Republika blamed the tragedy on the fact that \"our society's lifestyle is changing\". It urged the government to reflect that \"political life should not just be about power ... We want our families to be protected. We want a different world where our children are not deviating. We are in a transitional phase and our destruction at this time is the result of the negligence of those in power. Save our soul.\" </p> <p>The Jakarta Post, meanwhile, was outraged that Indonesia will be the only country competing at the Athens Olympics not broadcasting the games. In an editorial headlined \"Indonesia's Greek Tragedy\", the newspaper complained: \"We believe there is a problem of scheduling, and commercial stations are simply reluctant to sacrifice their prime-time, money-spinning reality and quiz shows for the Olympic games.\" </p> <p>Guessing that Indonesia's declining sporting fortunes in recent years could be partly to blame for the lack of broadcast interest, the newspaper continued: \"Given Indonesia's low standing in international and regional sports, our failure to broadcast the event, live or otherwise, would further undermine our national interest in sports and in our capacity to understand the age-old Olympic traditions of honouring excellence, international friendship and solidarity.\" </p> <p>Indonesia's slow season is unlikely to last much longer, however. Yesterday the government carried out its first execution in three years, of an Indian drug smuggler, and, if the TV news is anything to go by, that should dominate today's front pages.</p>",
  "<p>With its share price down almost a quarter over the past year and turmoil in the boardroom after the departure of both its chairman and chief executive, <strong>Rentokil Initial</strong> is ripe for takeover or break-up, dealers reckoned yesterday. </p> <p>The shares raced to the head of the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> leaderboard closing up 6p at 148.5p. The pest control and office cleaning firm has been in the spotlight since deputy chairman Brian McGowan ousted Sir Clive Thompson in May. </p> <p>Sir Clive, who forged the company during 20 years at the helm, was followed out the door by chief executive James Wilde late last month leaving Mr McGowan to search for what he terms an \"absolutely fresh set of eyes\". </p> <p>Who could present a more obvious fresh set of eyes than a new owner, quipped some in the market yesterday, whispering of interest in the company from the US. </p> <p>More likely, perhaps, is a break-up of the business when it reports interim figures on August 26. Not only did Mr McGowan engineer the break-up of Williams into Chubb and Kidde four years ago, but before he was pushed out, Sir Clive had been looking at selling the company's parcels delivery and conference facilities operations. </p> <p>Rentokil received interest in the latter business from a number of venture capital firms before becoming swamped by its current problems. </p> <p>The rise in Rentokil coupled with a strong performance from utility and banking stocks helped the main FTSE 100 index end up 5.3 points at 4413.4 points, on a volume of 2.45bn shares. </p> <p>Ofwat's pricing recommendations presented something of a mixed bag for the water industry but overall the declaration could have been worse and much of the industry had a buoyant day. <strong>United Utilities</strong> added 12.5p to 523p while <strong>Severn Trent</strong> rose 15.5p to 811.5p. </p> <p>Headed firmly in the opposite direction was <strong>Smith &amp; Nephew</strong>, down 52.5p at 481p, following second-quarter results which came in below expectations. </p> <p>Among the banking stocks, <strong>Barclays</strong> gained 11.25p to 481.25p after strong results and a better than expected increase in the dividend payout. The share price rise was tempered somewhat by concerns about rising costs at Barclays Capital and worries that the heavily increased dividend could deter a bidder. </p> <p><strong>Abbey National</strong> jumped 9.75p to 585p despite the fact that the recent drop in Banco Santander Central Hispano's share price has left its bid valu ing Abbey at only 555p a share. Traders are betting heavily on a competing offer from <strong>HBOS</strong>, off 5.5p at 690.5p. </p> <p>Away from the blue chips the <strong>FTSE 250</strong> index closed up five points at 5956.8 points, while the Small Cap index closed unchanged at 2464.9 points. </p> <p><strong> <a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a></strong> was the biggest second line faller, 19p lower at 107p, as Cazenove placed 18m shares at 95p each following its third-quarter figures, while the departure of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein as adviser caused <strong>Eurotunnel</strong> to lose 1.5p to 14p. </p> <p>On a more positive note, <strong>Spirent</strong> was the FTSE 250's biggest gainer, 7.75p higher at 55.5p, after the telecoms equipment manufacturer announced a return to first-half profits, and <strong>Egg</strong> climbed 5.25p higher to 104.5p, rallying somewhat from Wednesday's dip on the back of a large placing of shares. </p> <p><strong>Singer &amp; Friedlander</strong> gained 13p to 265p as Icelandic investment group Burdaras announced it had increased its stake in the financial firm by 5% to 8%. </p> <p>The appearance of Burdaras this week has raised the prospect in some traders' minds of an Icelandic battle for Singer. Icelandic bank Kaupthing Bunadarbanki is S&amp;F's biggest shareholder with a 19.5% stake. </p> <p><strong>Courts</strong> was 12.5p higher at 100p as the furniture retailer managed to persuade its banks to increase its overdraft facility. </p> <p>Its bankers have agreed to up its borrowing facility by \u00a320m to \u00a3280m - or almost \u00a3220m more than the company is currently worth. As a result the company's board will be able to sign off on its accounts when it meets this month. The company is still not going to return to the dividend list. </p> <p>Analysts said the move secured the company's short-term existence but concerns over current trading persist. </p> <p><strong>Kiln</strong> eased 1p to 79p on vague talk of trading worries at the underwriter, while electricians <strong>T Clarke</strong> lost 12p to 479p on similar worries ahead of its figures later this month. </p> <p>Among the small stocks, <strong>Real Affinity</strong> jumped 0.37p to 1p - a rise of 60% - following full-year results from the Alternative Investment Market-listed sports and media marketing company, which showed a decline in pre-tax losses to \u00a337,770 from \u00a31.3m. </p> <p><strong>Amberley Group</strong> added 1p to 14.75p as the cash shell said it plans to raise \u00a31m through a rights issue in order to provide the right financial profile for possible reverse takeovers. The fund raising will leave the company with \u00a32.5m in the bank. </p> <p>Finally, <strong>Blavod Extreme Spirits</strong>, the drinks business created by the merger of Blavod Vodka and the Extreme Beverage Co last year, closed up 1p at 34.5p after reporting increased annual losses but revealing it expects to increase sales in America over the next year. </p> <p>It has clinched a deal that will see it represent a host of Italian wine producers on the other side of the Atlantic. </p> <p><strong>Ennstone hits out at NAV</strong></p> <p>The board of building materials group Ennstone, down 0.25p at 34.25p, yesterday hit out at rebel shareholder North Atlantic Value's push to stop its acquisition of Johnston Group. </p> <p>NAV has support from Ennstone shareholders, representing about 40%. It wants a special meeting to block the bid which it considers mere \"empire building\". </p> <p>Ennstone's offer values Johnston at 446.25p a share, about an 88% premium to its price the day before the offer. Johnston closed flat yesterday at 412.5p. </p> <p>Ennstone's chairman Vaughan McLeod told shareholders that NAV did not talk to the board before going public and should drop its requisition and attend the shareholders' meeting on September 1 to clear the deal and voice its concerns</p>",
  "<p>World oil prices set a fresh record yesterday after the Russian government revoked permits allowing oil group Yukos to access its bank accounts for daily operations, leaving the company once again in danger of cutting production as early as next week. </p> <p>The move, which underlined the fragility of world oil supply at a time of soaring demand, pushed Brent futures above $41 (\u00a322.46) a barrel for the first time and US light crude futures to a record high of $44.50. American crude commands a premium over Brent because it contains more petrol. </p> <p>Oil prices have risen more than a third so far this year and the market has been spooked over the past week by brinkmanship between Yukos and the Russian government. The oil group, which is struggling to pay a $3.4bn tax bill, pumps 1.7m barrels a day, about 2% of world production and 20% of total Russian output. </p> <p>On Wednesday the Russian justice ministry unfroze the company's accounts, but in a statement yesterday it said: \"The [document] received by Yukos from a court bailiff is not based on the law and has therefore been withdrawn. </p> <p>\"All finances that have been transferred and will be trans ferred to the company's accounts will be seized by the court bailiff service and transferred to clear [Yukos's] debt,\" it added. </p> <p>A Yukos spokesman said the company had not yet been contacted by the justice ministry, and so could not comment on the reports. </p> <p>Yukos has until the end of August to pay the $3.4bn tax debt from 2000. It also faces a bill for $3.3bn from 2001 and may face equally large bills from subsequent years as the investigation continues. </p> <p>If the bill is not paid bailiffs say they will seize and sell Yukos's core operation, Yuganskneftegaz, a move that would leave the company a shadow of its former self. </p> <p>The company has been thrown a possible lifeline by BP, which has said it would back a sale by Yukos of its 56% stake in the Siberian gas group Rosplan to its joint venture partner TNK-BP, raising up to $360m. </p> <p>Yesterday's move leaves Yukos back where it started - unable to pay the cost of transporting its oil after August 10. </p> <p>\"The signal [to investors] is not a very positive one. What today's story implies is that Yukos may experience some potential operational disruptions,\" said Oleg Maximov, an oil and gas analyst with the Moscow-based stockbroker Troika Dialog. The company is able to store only about three days worth of production and Yukos chief executive officer Steven Theede has warned that, barring any reprieve, production will have to be cut by the middle of the month. </p> <p>Yukos's former chief executive and controlling shareholder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, is now on trial with fellow shareholder Platon Lebedev on charges of fraud, tax evasion and embezzlement in a case seen by many as being politically motivated. Mr Khodorkovsky had challenged president Vladimir Putin on the issue of government corruption and he financed liberal political parties. </p> <p>Oil prices retreated by more than a dollar late on Wednesday after the Russian government unfroze Yukos's accounts and Opec promised to increase production by 1m-1.5m barrels a day. </p> <p>But, with supply only just able to keep up with burgeoning demand, markets are jittery about any possible disruption - especially from Russia and the Middle East. </p> <p>Many analysts say oil is headed for $50 a barrel within weeks, leading economists to worry that higher prices could hurt the world economy.</p>",
  "<b> October 9 2003: Visit to consultant</b> <p>I go to the hospital with Jonny, my fiance, to see Alessandra Canal, a consultant plastic surgeon. I feel sick and shaky, and worry that she will think I do not warrant a breast reduction. I am a whopping 36G. My breasts are so heavy that my nipples are level with my belly button. The backache and shooting pains in my breasts are getting worse and I have constant groove marks in my shoulders from my bra straps. I am measured to see if I am big enough to qualify for the operation . I am - a relief, as I could not pay to go private. </p> <p><b> November 4 2003</b> </p> <p>I receive a letter informing me of the operation date: just under three weeks' time. I am excited, but Jonny asks if this is still what I really want. There is no doubt in my mind. Even knowing all the risks involved - loss of nipple, infections, anaesthetic complications - my mind is made up. </p> <p><b> November 14 2003</b> </p> <p>I decide to tell all our friends during a usual Friday evening at the pub. Living in a close community, I don't want to be talked about and want people to hear about the operation from me. Most of them have an idea and have been teasing Jonny, but tonight is my chance to get their reactions. They are embarrassed to begin with, but then want to know why I feel I have to have a breast reduction: I have always covered up so well. Even after explaining how I feel and the reasons why, the guys don't understand and think Jonny is a lucky chap. I am angry that they don't understand. Maybe they don't want to. I feel they see breasts purely as sexual objects for their benefit. </p> <p><b> November 17 2003</b> </p> <p>Feel negative and wonder what on earth I am doing. I am sick at work and very tearful. A friend talks me through it and reassures me that it is my decision, and that I can still change my mind. It is at this point that I feel, no, this is the right thing to do for me. </p> <p><b> November 24 2003: The operation</b> </p> <p>Wake up on Monday feeling queasy and am sick. I can't stop crying. Jonny tries to keep me calm. I feel guilty for putting him through this. I telephone the hospital and am told there is no bed available. Initially, I am relieved, but thenfeel devastated that I may not have my reduction. Then, two hours later, at 10am, we are told they have a bed. In the hospital, things move very quickly. Ms Canal marks my breasts where the incisions will be made and I am prepared for theatre. For the first time, I see how worried Jonny is and he breaks down. I hadn't realised how difficult this has been for him. </p> <p>Lying on the operating trolley, I am shaking so much my legs have to be held down. A heart monitor is attached, I squeeze the anaesthetist's hand and look at the clock - it is nine minutes before 2pm ... </p> <p>Wake up at 8pm in recovery and want to be left alone. Feel very tired and breathing is difficult. I stay in recovery overnight and am taken back to the ward, but feel worse. A chest x-ray reveals a collapsed lung; a chest drain is put in. Finally, I can breathe. Things improve quickly from this point. The chest drain is removed on Friday and I go home. </p> <p>After the weekend, I return to have my bandages removed. Excited about how \"they\" will look, but also apprehensive. Once the bandages are removed, I look down: it is strange to be able to see my tummy and nipples for the first time. My initial reaction is that, even without a bra, there is none of the back pain or heaviness I have suffered for so many years. Jonny is shocked by the prominent bruising and scars. I feel very emotional and cry, as the results are much better than I had imagined - and, for once, there is no pain. </p> <p><b> Recuperation</b> </p> <p>Recovery is slow. I'm tired and weak and rely on Jonny totally, even to bath me. My first shopping trip for new clothes is with a close friend. I am measured for a bra for the first time since the operation and am thrilled to be a 34C. It takes me two hours to decide which bras to buy; I have never had a choice before. Buying new tops is an eye-opener: I have gone down from a size 16/18 to a size 10/12. My whole attitude to buying clothes has changed, and I feel far more confident. </p> <p>Opting for a breast reduction was the biggest decision I have ever had to make - and one that took me nearly two years - but I have not had a minute's regret.</p>",
  "<p>Devotees of our occasional but always intensely felt editorials on the decline of the British weather forecast will know that, like Dickens's Mr Gradgrind, we just want to know the facts. An ideal forecast should tell us the weather for the day ahead, region by region, in clear language. The problem with the current forecasting culture is that it feels impossibly constrained by such basic proven principles. Instead of focusing on the weather for the next 24 hours, forecasters now prefer to sex it up, either by expressing the weather in terms of likely driving conditions, by speculating about more exciting weather many days ahead or by reporting on more dramatic weather affecting other parts of the globe. Instead of telling us about each part of the British Isles in a set order, they chop the country up arbitrarily, before delivering the regional elements, Dada-style, in whatever order happens to strike their fancy (Rob McElwee is a particular culprit). Finally, rather than use terms that are clear and understood, they describe the weather in a vocabulary of their own, rather as New Labour might do, leaving us to guess what these phrases are likely to mean in practice. </p> <p>The meaningless weather words of the moment are \"mist and murk\", a phrase that seems to have replaced \"spits and spots\" as the forecasters' favourite tic. But what do these words really mean? Mist is one thing, a meteorological phenomenon with which we are all familiar (unlike some of the forecasters, who insist, in defiance of decades of clean air legislation, on eliding all mist with fog and, even, with the anachronistic \"pea-souper\"). But murk? Originally, the word simply meant darkness, but it is not clear (sic) that this is what the forecasters imply nowadays. Hell is murky, cries Lady Macbeth as nemesis draws near, but this is seemingly not the intended implication either. The truth, we suspect, is that the forecasters are trying to tell us that the weather will be cloudy or overcast. So why not do so? These are well-understood words. They have weathered well.

  "<p>You can't help loving the Arcola because it is so full of surprises, because it mixes the local, the national and the international in one heady brew and because it never lets a little thing like lack of money get in the way of vaulting ambition. The words \"not possible\" simply don't figure in the director Mehmet Ergen's vocabulary. </p> <p>Release the Beat is a full-scale musical with a real edge and huge appeal to both a local crowd and a wider audience. It tells the story of Simone, daughter of club entrepreneur Jay Vinyl, and her friend Dionne as they embark on a coming-of-age odyssey in Ibiza's club culture, as their would-be lovers Winston and Tom go head-to-head in a mighty clash of the DJs. </p> <p>There are shades of A Midsummer Night's Dream in Karl Lewkowicz's musical that cleverly place house and hip-hop rhythms within the context of the traditional musical. The result is ragged, rough and ready, very fresh and completely invigorating. </p> <p>Judith Johnson's book and Lewkowicz's music and lyrics are a mixture of the tough and tender, and the performances have an engaging and unaffected openness. It is a very long way from perfect or even finished and there are times when you feel Lewkowicz has been too influenced by almost every musical writer who has gone before him - from Lionel Bart to Stephen Sondheim. </p> <p>But it is real summer fun and a more mature attempt to wed Shakespeare, hip-hop and the musical form than previous efforts such as The Donkey Show and Da Boyz, and one that has real potential for development. Let's hope somebody with some money and an interest in new musicals will check it out. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until August 21. Box office: 020-7503 1646.</p>",
  "<p>The original Live at Max's was recorded at Max's Kansas City in New York in 1970, while the Velvets were working on the Loaded album, and became a benchmark for the notion of \"official\" bootlegs. The hissy sound quality would never pass muster today, and you'd get a better recording on a smartphone, but it's the flaws and rawness that make it such a treasurable document.</p> <p>This twin-disc version packs in seven tracks missing from the original, so you get the band playing two complete sets (the extra songs include Who Loves the Sun, I'm Set Free and White Light, White Heat), but despite efforts to clean up the sound, the demi-monde ambience survives, with customers holding lengthy conversations mid-song and people buying drugs in the background. And despite the sound and numerous mistakes, the songs still emerge as classics.</p>",
  "<p>When erstwhile P Diddy protege Jamal \"Shyne\" Barrow was tried for his part in a 1999 nightclub shooting, the prosecutor used the rapper's belligerent lyrics against him in court. Four years into his 10-year jail term, Shyne is no more repentant. You can imagine the parole board's disapproving sighs when they hear him rap, on new track For the Record, that \"jail only made me a much more ruthless nigga\".</p> <p>The rest of Godfather Buried Alive was recorded back in 2001, before he entered prison. Although the gothic anguish of the first two tracks bodes well, it quickly transpires that Shyne is a bitter, self-pitying moron. As he fulminates against 50 Cent, rappers who only fire guns on movie sets (as opposed, presumably, to doing so in nightclubs) and \"this heartless judge\", macho bluster trumps insight every time. \"I ain't the problem,\" he protests on victim-of-the-system monologue Quasi OG.

  "<p>Crosby, Stills, Nash and (occasionally) Young's 35-year history has included tales of battling egos, separate tour buses, noses ravaged by cocaine abuse, a jail sentence and at least one instance of a sperm donation - when former Byrd Crosby sired a baby for country star Melissa Etheridge. Along the way, albums such as the anti-Vietnam Deja Vu and free-lurve anthems like Love the One You're With have ensured a similarly noteworthy musical legacy.</p> <p>This pairing of just Crosby and Nash, the first in 28 years, is like a collision between the Woodstock and CD generations. The trademark airy harmonies conjure up fields of flowery kaftans, but the production is bland and sophisticated. The likes of Luck Dragon are too respectful, and a double CD could have done with more rockers or Young's creative tension. Still, the searing, anti-Enron They Want it All picks up their old political attack, and Crosby's recent gun-possession fine suggests more episodes in rock's most enduring soap.</p>",

  "\"Pity the poor British motorist,\" cried Wednesday's <b>Daily Telegraph</b> as it considered the plight of drivers beset by \"the evil yellow box lurking in the central reservation\". <p>The Telegraph's ire was prompted by the Conservative party's accusation that the government was \"waging a war on drivers\" by using them in a cynical ploy to generate revenue. The party pledged to review the need for the 5,000 cameras currently in operation in England and Wales were it to win the next election. </p> <p>\"The Tories are quite right,\" the Telegraph continued. Speed cameras were \"clearly revenue-raising devices\". Claims that lower speeds mean fewer deaths were simplistic - after all, \"if no car could go above three miles an hour, there would be very few road deaths,\" the paper smirked. </p> <p>The following day, the Telegraph's Harry Mount was feeling the scrutiny of the yellow box - he faced losing his licence after being snapped speeding for the fourth time in three years. \"There are no other offences like it,\" he complained. \"All that matters in the eyes of the law is that you did it, irrespective of your state of mind.\" </p> <p>Wednesday's <b>Daily Express</b> was equally sceptical of the power of technology to deliver justice. \"Would it not be better to employ more road police who could not only watch out for speeding but also for dangerous driving and criminals?\" it asked. \"We want people, not machines, to keep us safe.\" </p> <p>Carol Midgley in the <b>Times</b> reckoned the Conservatives had made \"a staggeringly cynical play to the public gallery\", but she couldn't help agreeing with them. \"Where is the justice in a system that will prosecute a pensioner doing 33mph but be blind to a drunken driver slewing onto the pavement at 29mph?\" she asked. </p> <p>It was all about class for Johann Hari in the <b>Independent</b>. Speeding fines were the antisocial behaviour orders \"for the middle class, a way of punishing their largest (and most lethal) act\", he declared. \"However much the speed freaks of Middle England want to imagine they live in individualised steel cocoons\", they will one day have to come to terms with the fact that \"there is such a thing as society.\"</p>",
  "The commemoration of cataclysmic events of the second world war has become a sorry business. Not just because today's leaders seem to feel the need to apologise - or demand apologies - for unspeakable deeds perpetrated by long-dead compatriots. But also because accounts of the events are distorted by the tunnel vision of time and the demands of modern geopolitics. <p>In the past week Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the German leader, was in Poland acknowledging guilt for the annihilation of hundreds of thousands of Poles during the Warsaw uprising 60 years ago this month, while Polish prime minister Marek Belka has been pressing for a British apology for failing to come to the Poles' aid. </p> <p>The sweeping impression from the anniversary coverage of the uprising has been that both the western allies and Soviet forces sat on their hands while the Polish resistance was slaughtered by the Nazis. This is simply not true. </p> <p>Throughout the cold war, western historians and their governments accused Stalin of preventing the Red Army from aiding the uprising. It is true Stalin had no interest in seeing anti-communist rebels take control of Warsaw and refused US and British aircraft the use of Soviet bases to drop supplies, as was the case elsewhere. </p> <p>But even US historians say that documents released by Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union show that the Red Army initially made every reasonable effort to come to the Poles' assistance and later chose not to largely because this would have required a reorientation of military efforts and a slackening of the main offensive against German forces. </p> <p>There was little that the Soviet generals could have done, even if they had wanted to. The west bank of the Vistula in Warsaw is on high ground and gave the Nazis even more of an advantage over any attacker than their military superiority already provided. </p> <p>The suggestion that the bulk of the Red Army was camped on the east bank of the Vistula is wrong. As William Mackenzie, official historian of Britain's Special Operations Executive, has written, the Polish general Bor-Komorowski was prompted to signal the beginning of the uprising by the appearance of \"small Russian forces 10 miles from Warsaw on July 31\" - one day before the rebellion began. \"These troops were not a spearhead but the extreme left flank of a wide turning movement, dangerously exposed to counter-attack, and ... there was no strategic justification for an immediate Russian attack on Warsaw\". </p> <p>It is also wrong to suggest that Britain and the western allies did nothing. \"From August 1 to the final surrender on October 2 there was unending passionate discussion up to the highest levels,\" according to Mackenzie, about how to support the rebels. Allied aircrews launched attempts to airdrop supplies but the \"rate of loss was far higher than could be borne continuously; there were other resistance movements dependent on the same resources\". </p> <p>Two squadrons of night-flying Liberators flew 54 sorties to Warsaw from Italy on the night of August 13-14, resulting in 23 successful airdrops, but at the cost of 11 aircraft lost and 11 damaged by flak. </p> <p>Historian Martin Gilbert says that on August 4, 13 British bombers flew from Foggia in Italy to Poland. Five failed to return and only two reached as far as Warsaw, where they dropped 24 containers of ammunition. \"Twelve containers fell into the hands of the insurgents; 12 fell into German-controlled parts of the city.\" </p> <p>Britain especially has been portrayed as callous. Aircrews died trying to help Polish rebels. Maybe someone should now be thinking of saying sorry to their descendants, not only for their deaths but because their sacrifice was effectively eradicated from history this week. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Eve-Ann Prentice reported from Poland in the 1980s; she is the author of One Woman's War </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:eveann@eve-ann.freeserve.co.uk\">eveann@eve-ann.freeserve.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Something was missing from last week's BBC Jazz awards, and it wasn't just John Rae's drumsticks (which he couldn't find when he arrived at his kit). What we lacked were decent compositions, and jazz needs them as surely as it needs improvisers. Sure, the place was full of talented people such as David Okumu and Tom Herbert (Jade Fox), Colin Steele, Tom Arthurs (off-screen trumpet star of The Mighty Boosh), Seb Rochford, Soweto Kinch (performing his great rap piece Jazz Planet), and Heritage award winner Keith Nichols, who swung like crazy. But the tunes were never the main event. The Richard Fairhurst piece that won the \"best composition\" award was underdeveloped. The most serious jazz writing we heard was the late Neil Ardley's Le D\u00e9jeuner Sur l'Herbe, playing in the background during drinks, and that's more than 35 years old. We need new jazz composers who are committed to writing with the passionate intensity of the best performers - and that's what makes American composer Maria Schneider such a great artist. </p> <p>A great jazz composer really can make a difference, organising their performers' instincts for spontaneous music-making in a way that enhances the expression of both composer and improviser. This is why Duke Ellington still sounds so good: check out reissues such as <strong> Ellington Uptown</strong> (Columbia Legacy \u00a39.99) and the slightly less distinguished <strong> Piano in the Background </strong> (Columbia Legacy, \u00a39.99). You can hear a very European take on this method in Ardley's <strong> The Greek Variations </strong> (Impressed Re-pressed/Universal, \u00a310.99), a Denis Preston production featuring the work of Don Rendell and Ian Carr, now rescued from secondhand cult status by this reissue series. </p> <p>Fortunately jazz history is studded with great composers - from Monk and Mingus to Gil Evans and Carla Bley - and Schneider is the latest keeper of this fragile flame. <strong> Concert in the Garden </strong> (ArtistShare), by the Maria Schneider Orchestra, is a strong contender for album of the year. (However, you can only buy this magnificent and rewarding CD from mariaschneider.com.) </p> <p>Three major pieces make up the hour-long album: the elegant title track (the title comes from a poem by Octavia Paz); Buleria, Solea Y Rumba; and Three Romances, each of whose nine-minute movements references a form of dance. Schneider knows how to pace and structure her materials so that there are no dull spots, and she elicits poised, emotional solos from her musicians: Ingrid Jensen's flugelhorn on Pas De Deux; Frank Kimbrough's piano on Danca Ilusoria. </p> <p>The work is scored for five saxes (doubling woodwind), four trumpets, four trombones and rhythm section, but Schneider adds strategic colours at key moments: cajons in stereo; accordion; the gorgeous voice of Luciana Souza. The album was recorded, with a full sound and a sensitivity that catches the nuances of performance and orchestration, by the masterful David Baker at Avatar Studios in New York. (Baker died of a heart attack, aged 58, last month.) </p> <p>Buleria, Solea Y Rumba, the long, dark closing track, is a beautifully scored, largely through-composed piece. You have to wait for five minutes before Donny McCaslin's improvised tenor solo begins, but it's well worth it: he blows in a way that grows organically from Schneider's motifs, adding grandeur and complexity to her compositional vision. Souza's voice, laced beguilingly with the woodwinds in the middle section, leads to a solo by Greg Gisbert on flugelhorn. </p> <p>The title track is a delicate, evanescent piece in which Gary Versace's accordion and Souza's voice are wrapped in a delicious jumble of exuberant writing for the full ensemble. Schneider can take big, complex musical ideas and make them seem light and accessible - an orchestral sleight of hand that's as delightfully baffling on the fifth listen as on the first time you encounter it. Before you know it, we've moved on to a fast guitar solo (Ben Monder) that subsides into glassy solo chords to introduce a duet for accordion and piano (Frank Kimbrough). Schneider eases the ensemble back in behind the duo: the transition from improvisation to composition is made with the grace of a dancer. Perfection.</p>",
  "George Bush was not pulling his punches. In a definitive policy speech earlier this year on preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the US president declared: \"The greatest threat before humanity today is the possibility of secret and sudden attack with chemical or biological or radiological or nuclear weapons. <p>\"America will not permit terrorists and dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most deadly weapons,\" he went on. \"We're determined to confront those threats at source. We will stop these weapons from being acquired or built. We'll block them being transferred. We'll prevent them ever being used.\" </p> <p>The US position, it seems, could hardly be clearer. So how to explain, and how conceivably to justify, a little-noticed demarche last week by Mr Bush's officials at the UN conference on disarmament in Geneva? What the US did, in effect, was to torpedo a new global treaty banning the production and supply of materials essential to the building of nuclear weapons. </p> <p>It is known as the fissile material cut-off treaty. It has been under discussion for years, strongly supported by Britain and the EU. Its main aim is to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), the cornerstone of the international effort to curb the spread of WMD. It is specifically aimed at nuclear-armed states such as India, Pakistan and Israel which are not party to the NPT. </p> <p>But by seeking a global halt to the production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium for weapons, its wider overall aim is to reduce the chance of such materials being obtained by irresponsible regimes or non-state terror groups. </p> <p>While dismaying, the Bush administration's stance was not totally unexpected. Bill Clinton backed the fissile material treaty in 2000, but once in office the Bush administration dragged its feet. Last year in Geneva it announced a review of its position, thus delaying further talks. </p> <p>Last week the US ambassador to the conference, Jackie Wolcott Sanders, finally gave the go-ahead for negotiations, but with a fatal caveat attached. </p> <p>The US would back the treaty in principle, but it would not support the inclusion of binding monitoring, verification and inspection provisions. </p> <p>A state department statement said the proposed inspection regime \"would have been so extensive that it could compromise key signatories' core national security interests, and so costly that many countries will be hesitant to accept it\". </p> <p>But as the US knows very well, any new treaty is all but unenforcable without effective monitoring and verification. Inspections are essential, say arms control experts, if such treaties are to work. That is a view with which the British government, for example, wholeheartedly agrees. </p> <p>\"We believe that such a treaty should be established. We support it. It is a useful step towards curbing global proliferation,\" a Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday. \"We continue to believe it should be verified. We do not take the same position as the US.\" </p> <p>In private, officials are hard put to conceal their disappointment at the US stance. </p> <p>Stated American concern about security and cost does not wholly explain it. At the nub of the issue is Washington's fundamental objection to opening up American military bases and industrial plants to international, especially UN, inspection. </p> <p>For the neo-conservatives and ideologues around Mr Bush this is a visceral objection - even a matter of principle. Put plainly, they appear content to place the safeguarding of an uncompromised, untrammelled American sovereignty ahead of effective global arms control. </p> <p>And they have plenty of form. In 2001, for this same basic reason, the Bush administration scuppered a proposed inspections regime to police the biological weapons convention, again to Britain's great dismay. </p> <p>For much the same reason, perhaps, key aims of the 1997 chemical weapons convention (CWC) remain unfulfilled. Between them the US and Russia possess more than 97% of the world's known chemical weapons material, but neither will remotely meet the 2007 deadline for its full destruction, according to the US government accountability office. It says more inspections are needed to enforce the CWC, especially at dual-use chemical plants. </p> <p>For much the same reason, the Bush administration has set aside the comprehensive test ban treaty and is pressing ahead, beyond international scrutiny and in defiance of the NPT, with the development of new generation nuclear weapons. </p> <p>Iranians and North Koreans are under intense US pressure to cooperate with inspectors from the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency. But to Mr Bush, it seems, international verification procedures are a one-way street. What happened in Geneva last week underlined that. </p> <p>The very same US government that went to war in Iraq because Saddam Hussein did not fully comply with UN weapons inspections unilaterally rejects similar control over its own WMD arsenal.</p>",
  "Police are scouring a patchwork of copses and game bird estates for a former miner suspected of murdering a neighbour after g a \"blazing row\" about the 1984 miners' strike. <p>Armed officers and a helicopter equipped with heat-seeking equipment have joined the hunt for Robert Boyer, 42, who vanished with an air rifle and warm clothing after a \"vicious\" attack on Keith Frogson, a 62-year-old veteran of the National Union of Mineworkers with a name for denouncing strike-breaking \"scabs\".</p> <p>Detectives are working on a theory that Mr Boyer, who is believed to have joined the Union of Democratic Mineworkers and worked through the dispute, saw old resentments revive after a TV programme marking the strike's 20th anniversary.</p> <p>Mr Frogson was found 18 days ago with lacerations to his head and upper body on the doorstep of his terrace house in Annesley Woodhouse, near Mansfield in Nottinghamshire.

She, her sister Mandy, 36, and brother Wayne, 34, are now being protected by armed officers.</p> <p>A squad of police, some with guns, broke down the door of Mr Boyer's house late on Wednesday after a tip-off that he could be hiding in a roof space running most of the length of the terrace of colliery-built cottages. Nothing was found in the house or one next door, which was also searched. Both properties back on to Mr Frogson's garden.</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Russ Foster, who is leading the murder and arson inquiries, said Mr Boyer's appearance had changed from the seven-year-old picture issued by police last week.</p> <p>He is now described as looking more gaunt and showing the effects of living rough. \"When seen on Sunday, he looked dirty and unkempt, he had lost weight and had a thinner face,\" Det Ch Insp Foster said.</p> <p>\"He also had facial hair and was wearing a green woollen hat, dark biker jacket, pale blue jeans and dark shoes or boots.\"</p> <p>Mr Frogson, who was well known in the village, was killed within 15 minutes of leaving his local pub. Neighbours said he had been involved in a furious argument earlier in the evening.</p> <p>It has not been confirmed that the argument was with Mr Boyer, but police said yesterday that the two men were known to have had a serious falling-out several years ago. Officers are checking UDM membership records after suggestions that the miners' strike caused the bad blood.</p> <p>Neighbours of both men were appalled at the violence used in the attack, which saw one and probably more sharp instruments used to slash and cut the victim. The crossbow may also have been used, but results of a postmortem examination have not yet confirmed this.</p> <p>Criminal profilers who took part in last month's successful hunt for Mark Hobson, after two double killings in north Yorkshire, have joined the search.</p>",

  "<p>Martha Lane Fox once confessed that she originally dismissed Brent Hoberman's business plan for Lastminute.com as \"far too complicated\". A reader of the company's results knows the feeling: you have to wade through acres of stuff about \"dynamic packaging sales\" and \"total transaction value\" before getting to what most of us still recognise as a hard number - pre-tax profit. </p> <p>In Lastminute's case, for the first nine months of this financial year it was a pre-tax loss of \u00a356.5m. Add up the pre-tax losses in the first five years of Lastminute's life (\u00a3180m in total) and this business has so far made pre-tax losses of almost a quarter of a billion quid. It is an astonishing sum. Mr Hoberman, naturally, would prefer to be judged by other measures of profit, but there is only so long that an acquisitive company (14 deals and counting) can expect outsiders to ignore the depreciation and goodwill charges that litter each set of accounts. Lastminute likes to argue that its goodwill accounting is conservative because it writes off over four years rather than 20. The alternative view is that the treatment suggests the assets have a short economic life. </p> <p>The Lastminute story is building to a climax. Next year is the one in which shareholders have been promised great things: analysts expect profits, before all the nasties, of \u00a350m and roughly the same in cash generation. So the timing of yesterday's comments about \"challenging\" market conditions could hardly have been worse. Lastminute seems to be struggling to trim a cost base that has been bloated by all the deals and is having to spend more heavily on marketing to compete with Expedia, budget airlines et al. </p> <p>The original, and simple, idea of matching supply and demand has become very complicated.

Profits are up 37% to \u00a3600m. </p> <p>Some of his hires are in the US to help BarCap's new assault on the mortgage-backed securities market, America's biggest capital market, dominated by big US players. In the space of a year, BarCap has pretty much doubled its market share in most of America's big capital market-type businesses. It is setting its sights in the US on bigger expansion. Mr Diamond has also hired 30 \"very senior\" people in Europe. </p> <p>The price of this is a rise in costs at the parent, which revealed yesterday that \u00a3142m has been incurred to cover performance-related pay deals on top of \u00a3175m for recruiting people in the first place, albeit not just at BarCap but in the regular banking business as well. </p> <p>Mr Diamond - who does not sit on the Barclays board, despite running a business that generates around a fifth of group profits - has set himself a target of doubling revenue and profitability by 2007. He is not against acquisitions to make his business grow faster. Neither is he against moving back into advising on mergers and acquisitions, just as BZW did. After what has already proved to be an extraordinary period of expansion, this is ambitious stuff. Rivals will be watching, carefully. </p> <p><strong> A lesson </strong><br> </p> <p>We ran ahead of ourselves here on Wednesday in arguing that beleaguered shareholders in British Energy had every right and reason to seek a renegotiation of the financial rescue package first agreed last autumn. </p> <p>The package has yet to be approved by European regulators before shareholders will be asked to vote on the matter later this year. But since wholesale electricity prices have spiked higher since the rescue was first agreed, British Energy is suddenly looking rather healthier than it did. Shareholders, however, will be left with just 2.5% of the company, control passing instead to the bondholders, who have agreed to write off about half of British Energy's \u00a31.3bn debt. </p> <p>But while there was plenty of fuming at yesterday's annual meeting, there is a central flaw to the shareholders' case: they didn't want to put up the cash to bail out British Energy when it was threatening to go bust. They are the first port of call for a company which needs refinancing. It is only when it is clear that shareholders will not put up more money that negotiations with the bond holders have to begin. The government should resist any temptation to use taxpayers' money to sweeten the mixture for shareholders. But it should learn the lesson that if a publicly listed company is perceived to carry a state guarantee (as with Railtrack as well as British Energy), the markets will exploit that.</p>",
  "<p>Roger Bennett, the head of the <a href=\"http://www.elspa.co.uk\">Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association</a> has written an open letter to David Blunkett condemning the \"misleading\" reporting related to last week's Leicestershire tragedy, in which the 18+ game Manhunt was implicated. It touches on the usual, including the reported absence of links between violent behaviour and computer gaming, the $20bn the games industry circulates internationally per year, and the good that the games industry does for schools via the Entertainment Software Charity. It also does a bit of government hand slapping. You can find the full text below.</p> <p>One quick note. I hate to say this, but while it's true that in the academic literature there is no link between long-term aggressive behaviour/violence and computer gaming, there is a link, like with TV, movies, loud music, shouting a lot, being in the same room as your younger brother for an extended period of time, jumping up and down repeatedly and walking over a precarious precipice, with getting all het up <em>in the short term</em>. Heart-pounding stuff. Sweats. Buzzing in ears. Stimulation. It doesn't mean that you do anything about it, but it happens. The <a href=\"http://www.hemi-syncsource.bigstep.com/\">dolphin-sound-effects-for-relaxation</a> industry would be out of business if it didn't.</p> <p>Gosh, I feel I'm letting the side down here.</p> <p>5th August 2004</p> <p>Dear Mr Blunkett</p> <p>COMPUTER &amp; VIDEO GAMES</p> <p>As the trade organisation representing the computer and video games industry, we have been very concerned recently about the misleading and disingenuous reporting about the effects of playing interactive games software. In particular, the tragic case of Stefan Pakeerah's murder by Warren Le Blanc in Leicester, which was linked by some parts of the media and by Mr Keith Vaz MP, to a video game called \"Manhunt\", published quite legally by one of our members as a BBFC 18+ rated game. We will continue to uphold the legal right of this member and others to target their product at the burgeoning adult market for computer and video games in an honest and legal manner.</p> <p>As you will know, despite many research projects into the effects of screen violence, some of which have been undertaken by eminent academics in their field, no link with violent behaviour has been found. Furthermore, I would like to reassure you that ELSPA members, that includes all the companies responsible for the distribution of computer and video games in UK, fully conform with both the letter and spirit of the law and the strict Codes of Practice our members must adopt on enrolment. ELSPA, on behalf of all its members and the members themselves, take its responsibilities extremely seriously in the context of these matters.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, I feel sure you will already be aware that less that 1% of computer and video games published and distributed in UK attract an 18+ BBFC Rating and that in excess of 65% of all games are suitable for all ages.</p> <p>It was unfortunate that Mr Vaz should speak out so irrationally against the companies concerned with the development and distribution of \"Manhunt\" and indeed our industry in general. Had he taken time to check with the Leicestershire Constabulary, he would have been informed that they do not and have not ever linked this brutal crime with any video game.</p> <p>The UK computer and video games industry has a large stake-holding in the global market worth $20 billion. Some of the most successful games in this valuable market are produced in UK, employing many thousands of people and it is very much in the vanguard of \"Creative Britain\". The economic and cultural value of the interactive entertainment software industry is well recognised by many Government Depts as a major contributor to the UK economy and increasingly a cultural factor, as illustrated by the international Games Festival in Edinburgh later this month. In addition, London will host the first European trade event, European Games Network (EGN), in September this year and London is also the location for an international conference, \"The Games Summit\", held annually in June. A major exhibition for consumers, entitled \"Game Stars Live\" will take place concurrently with EGN at Excel, Docklands.</p> <p>As a matter of interest, you may not be aware that our industry charity, Entertainment Software Charity (ESC), of which I am a Trustee, has funded specialist Schools status for eight schools across the country this year. In addition, we have also recently confirmed with the DfES that the games industry will fund the building of a new \"City Academy\" in Paddington, London. I hope you will recognise this as another illustration of levels of responsibility we attach to the status of our industry.</p> <p>I hope you will accept that we felt it necessary to put the record straight in respect to these tragic events and that are pleased to be in a position to be proud of our industry's successful achievements and the standards of responsibility we have adopted.</p> <p>Yours sincerely</p> <p>Roger Bennett Director General Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association</p>",
  "The latest round of terrorist arrests in Pakistan has sparked a security alert in New York and Washington, rumours of a Heathrow bomb plot in London, and claims of victory in the war on terror in Islamabad. They have also made observers wonder about the trigger for the arrests, and the extent to which the Pakistani security services are producing terrorists out of a hat at politically expedient moments rather than cracking down on extremism. <p>Officials in Pakistan have rounded up 20 terrorists in the last month, including Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian indicted for his role in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He was arrested along with 13 others on July 25, and at least six other people have been held since then. </p> <p>Those arrests followed the capture of computer expert Muhammed Naeem Noor Khan, whose computer allegedly held details of a planned attack on Heathrow and five financial institutions in New York, Washington, DC and New Jersey. In addition, the Pakistani interior minister, Faisal Saleh Hayyat, said his country was holding two senior al-Qaida fugitives of African origin, one of whom had a multi-million dollar bounty on his head. He has refused to name them, say where they were from, or reveal when they had been arrested. </p> <p>The Pakistani security services made their most high profile catch to date in March 2003 when they seized Sheikh Khalid Mohammad, allegedly the mastermind of the September 11 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre and Pentagon. He has been extradited to the US.</p> <p>Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, told English language newspaper Dawn that the latest arrests proved his government had the courage to confront Islamist terrorists and was meeting with significant success.</p> <p>\"Nobody was touching religious organisations, now we are touching them,\" he told the paper. \"Therefore, they will set off bomb blasts, they will create problems for you. Because we are arresting them, and ... we are eliminating masterminds.\"</p> <p>In the past, however, roundups of terrorists have often coincided with politically convenient moments for Pakistan. The latest arrests come after Mr Musharraf pardoned the father of Pakistan's nuclear programme, Abdul Qadeer Khan, after the US accused him of selling nuclear expertise and equipment to Libya, Iran and North Korea. </p> <p>Such blatant promotion of nuclear proliferation would normally earn a country the status of rogue state, and the sanctions that come with it. But the US held off, some believe because the US president, George Bush, wanted Pakistan to come up with some senior al-Qaida figures before the US election in November. </p> <p>But Gareth Price, senior research fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, said the shift in Mr Musharraf's motivation could be traced to an assassination attempt in December, and the fact that he and his government are the most obvious targets for extremists within Pakistan. </p> <p>\"Musharraf is not hedging his bets anymore. It is not clear how much the ISI [Pakistani security services] act autonomously, but they clearly are finding people, arresting them, and handing them over the US.</p> <p>\"Pakistan does tick most of the boxes of a rogue state, so it has to demonstrate that it is not,\" Dr Price said.</p> <p>Muhammad Ali Siddiqi, the assistant editor of Dawn, said the reason for the success of the anti-terror strategy was simply one of resources. With a peace process underway along the line of control in Kashmir, Mr Musharraf had been able to move troops to the tribal areas where many of the terrorists have sought refuge.</p> <p>\"By a rough estimate, Pakistan has deployed 70,000 troops in the Wana area in South Waziristan. This could not have been possible earlier,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Siddiqi also felt that no deal between the US and Pakistan was necessary to convince Mr Musharraf to crack down on terrorists, as the country itself had been the victim of devastating attacks. Last week nine people died in an unsuccessful assassination attempt on Pakistan's prime minister-designate, Shaukat Aziz. </p> <p>\"I do not think there is a bargain of that sort. Trial or no trial [of Dr Khan], the US would expect Pakistan to continue the war on terror. At Camp David last year, the US pledged a $3bn (\u00a31.64bn) economic and military package spread over five years. Each year Congress will approve $600m only when it is satisfied that Pakistan is behaving,\" he said. </p> <p>In the long term, Dr Price said, the combination of US aid money and an internal crackdown on terrorists could result in a different kind of Pakistan. With money for education, he said, \"people won't feel so radicalised and they won't be educated only in madrasahs [schools for Islamic religious instruction].\"</p> <p>Change on that scale takes a long time, he added, and there was reason to fear that Mr Musharraf may not live to see it.</p>",
  "Two leaders of a mosque in the US were today arrested for helping an undercover agent they believed was a terrorist to buy a shoulder-launched missile. <p>The men, Yassin Aref, 34, and Mohammed Hoosain, 49, of the Masjid as-Salam in Albany, New York, are alleged to have been involved in the money laundering aspect of the plot.</p> <p>The sting operation was running for a year and officials said it had no link to Sunday's warning in the US of a terrorist attack on financial institutions in New York, Newark and Washington.</p> <p>Several houses were searched in the Albany area.</p> <p>The Associated Press reported that federal law enforcement officials believe the men, one an iman, the other one of the mosque's founders, to have ties to Ansar al-Islam, which is itself linked to Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the man blamed for insurgent attacks in Iraq, and al-Qaida.</p> <p>Concerns about terrorists using shoulder-fired missiles to take down commercial airliners were heightened in November 2002 when two SA-7 missiles narrowly missed an Israeli passenger jet as it took off from Mombasa, Kenya. </p> <p>Last November, a shoulder-fired missile struck a DHL cargo plane at Baghdad airport, forcing it to make an emergency landing.</p> <p>In a similar sting operation last year, a British arms dealer was arrested in New Jersey and charged with trying to sell a shoulder-fired missile to an undercover agent posing as a terrorist wanting to shoot down a US airliner.</p>",
  "<p>NOTHING EVER HAPPENS</p> <p>The Fiver knows all about standing around waiting, desperately hoping something will happen: we do it every Friday and Saturday night. But whereas we know the exact location - front and centre on the Chaserz dance floor, or propping up the bar flashing the fifties - the sweaty hacks sniffing round Svengate today weren't so lucky. Not only did less happen than in a Brian Eno song, but none of them knew where it was happening anyway! </p> <p>The meeting to decide Dirty Sven's future - which knowing our luck will now be revealed at the exact moment the Fiver flunkies send this - took place at a venue so secret that the FA suits involved had to be blindfolded and brought there!

After all, Svennis wasn't there. </p> <p>Instead, the Old Speckled one had to stay home all day listening to Shed Seven's 'On Standby' on loop.

There's nothing worse than someone who thinks they're hilarious when they're not, is there? What's that you say about teatime emails? </p> <p>Thankfully, news eventually broke that Faria Alam has recruited Max Clifford and is selling her story to the tabloids! \"She wants to give her version in her own words,\" Clifford said. Ah, so she's doing it in the name of truth, rather than make a quick buck? How refreshi-up to \u00a3750k you say? Blimey. \"I think she's a lovely and very intelligent woman,\" Clifford cooed, \"and her story gives a unique insight into those at the top of football in this country.\" Ah, so you're doing it because it's an issue that concerns you, Max, rather than for the money?

According to Mutu's agent, he is \"99% sure that Mutu will sign a contract with Juventus in a matter of days\", which leaves the Fiver asking what on earth happened to that small but oh-so-telling 1%. Probably siphoned off to pay for a new set of fake gold cufflinks or something. \"Adrian doesn't want to watch matches from the sidelines,\" explained Mr 10%, as Mutu sat at home fiddling pathetically with a TV remote and wondering why his subscription to Chelsea TV had suddenly been cut off. \"He wants to play.\"</p> <p>Phil Carrick wants to play too - can you see what the Fiver did there? - but the only question is: Everton or Portsmouth? Not exactly the mother of all choices we'll grant you, but one that needs making after Portsmouth were forced to up their offer to West Ham from \u00a32.5m to \u00a33m in order to keep up with Everton. \"Michael leaving was something we knew would happen,\" explained Hammers boss Alan Pardew, before dropping to his knees and sobbing: \"We need the money.\" He needn't worry.

  "<p><strong>Not that I want to be the kind of woman who spends her time cleaning behind the fridge, but I do at least like to be sure that the inside smells hygienic. Any tips?</strong> </p> <p>Buy a tub of bicarbonate of soda. Make a little of it into a weak solution to wipe down the shelves and surfaces, and keep a bowl of the dry stuff inside the fridge to absorb any strong odours. For a more pleasant smell, leave a little ground coffee in an open packet on the shelf. And you can relax about cleaning behind the fridge - it only needs doing every six months. Pull it out from the wall, dust the wiggly pipes at the back, vacuum any debris you have revealed, wipe down streaks and spills on the sides of the fridge with a solution of washing-up liquid - and relax with a smug smile. </p> <p><strong>You say the fridge needs to be kept at or below 5C. So how can I be sure mine is?</strong> </p> <p>Strictly speaking, it should be between 0C and 5C (32F and 41F), and the only way to check that your fridge is keeping your food cool enough for safety is to put a fridge thermometer on the middle shelf. The one that did best in recent Good Housekeeping Institute tests is the Ultimo fridge-freezer thermometer, \u00a34.55 (stockists 015394 88100; <a href=\"http://www.lakelandlimited.co.uk\">www.lakelandlimited.co.uk</a>). It's easy to use, with a clear dial with accurate readings in celsius and fahrenheit. </p> <p><strong>I'm thinking of replacing my under-counter fridge and freezer with a combined fridge-freezer. What can you recommend?</strong> </p> <p>Among the fridges in this test that had them, the iceboxes are mostly designed for little more than a tub of ice cream and a packet of frozen peas. In the Good Housekeeping Institute's most recent tests on fridge-freezers (July 2003), top marks went to the fridge-on-top Hotpoint FFA60S, \u00a3329.90-\u00a3360, 80/100 (standard width and depth, 1,611mm high) and the American-style side-by-side Whirlpool conquest S20B RSS31, \u00a31,377-\u00a31,999.95, 78/100, 1,750mm high x 902mm wide. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Next month's product test, to be published on September 2, will be on microwave ovens.

  "<p>Unless you see your fridge as a style statement dominating the kitchen, American-style, all you really need is a white box that fits the space left by your old one and which keeps lots of food cold enough to discourage food-poisoning bugs from multiplying (below 5C). Your main decisions are whether you need your fridge to slide into the space under the kitchen worktop, and whether you want an icebox. </p> <p>If you do have a designer kitchen screaming out for something stylish in brushed steel, there are several to choose from - but you'll pay a hefty premium. Strictly in the fashion league, for example, is the tall retro-style metallic grey Gorenje R27460 TLA fridge with icebox - at \u00a3700. </p> <p>So many fridges had earned the top A rating for energy efficiency that A+ and A++ ratings have been introduced. The higher rating is no guarantee of good performance, though. Nor is it likely to save you more than around \u00a32 in annual electricity costs. </p> <p>Testing fridges for performance is about as fascinating as watching paint dry, and much more time-consuming. All you need to know is that the fridges we're recommending keep their contents at 5C or below and return to it fast after you've opened the door for a minute or two. The scores out of 100 are largely based on these performance tests, but also include ratings for ease of use, design and instructions. </p> <p>You can fit any of the recommended fridges into a standard kitchen unit width and depth space, with the exception of the Haier and the Liebherr tall fridges, which are 670mm and 630mm deep respectively. In terms of how much food you can fit in, there's considerable variation, however - manufacturers quote a net-capacity figure, discounting space taken up by shelves and icebox, if any. To be able to freeze fresh food and keep it for up to three months, you need a four-star icebox or freezer. With a two-star icebox you can store frozen food for up to a week. </p> <p>Only the Miele has controls that can be set to a particular temperature - the rest have factory-set controls with numbers. All fridges tested have self-levelling feet and concealed evaporator plates, and all but the Candy are self-defrosting.</p> <p><strong>Under \u00a3200</strong></p> <p><strong>Frigidaire RL6003B </strong><br>\u00a3140 <br>Score: 82/100</p> <p><strong>Technical data: </strong>Under-counter fridge, no icebox.

  "A US helicopter was today shot down in the southern Iraqi city of Najaf as marines fought militia loyal to the renegade Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. It was the worst fighting in the holy city since Mr Sadr led a rebellion there in April and May. <p>The US military said no fatalities had been incurred in the shooting down of the helicopter, but added that some of its crew had been wounded. </p> <p>The Najaf violence was sparked after militiamen attacked a police station in Revolution of 1920 Square with mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and Kalashnikov rifles during the early hours, prompting US marines to intervene.</p> <p>The fierce clashes left two people dead and eight others injured, Iraqi health ministry officials said today. </p> <p>The fighting, the fiercest for weeks, threatens a fragile ceasefire between the Mahdi army and Iraqi and US authorities.</p> <p>Najaf's governor, Adnan al-Zurufi, told the al-Jazeera television channel that the US marines had intervened \"to help the policemen protect the police stations and the city\", and warned of \"very bad consequences\" if the militia did not disarm and leave.</p> <p>\"This issue must come to an end,\" he told al-Jazeera. \"If not, there will be no choice but military operations to end the situation.\" </p> <p>On Tuesday, police said Mr Sadr's militia had kidnapped officers, apparently intending to use them as bargaining tools in an attempt to force authorities to release militants being detained. </p> <p>His supporters denied the accusations, saying police were provoking them by trying to arrest some of the group's leaders. </p> <p><b>UK troops in Basra gun battle</b></p> <p>British forces were also briefly involved in fighting with militia loyal to Mr Sadr. In the southern city of Basra, militants fought UK troops in a 15 minute gun battle that left two insurgents dead. No troops were wounded.</p> <p>The firefight came after Mr Sadr's Mahdi army had threatened to attack UK forces unless they freed four men detained during a raid on his party's office on Tuesday. </p> <p>British commanders had earlier dismissed a Mahdi army ultimatum to free the detainees. The militia had threatened to enter the city and take over government buildings if the men were not released.</p> <p>Further north, a series of battles between Iraqi authorities and insurgents in Mosul during the last 24 hours killed 14 civilians and eight insurgents, the US military said. No Iraqi or coalition forces were killed in the violence. </p> <p>Iraqi authorities said 17 people had been killed and 47 wounded.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> It was today reported that Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, 73, Iraq's most revered Shia cleric and one of the most powerful men in the country, is suffering from heart trouble. </p> <p>One of his aides told Reuters that it was the first time he had suffered heart trouble. \"He cancelled all his meetings for last week, and Iraqi cardiologists are looking after him,\" the aide said.</p> <p><b>US stands firm over kidnappings</b></p> <p>No further concessions will be made to kidnappers in Iraq after the Philippines withdrew its troops from the country in exchange for the release of a hostage, the US state department said last night. </p> <p>The Foreign Office today said it backed the US stance, and US officials said many other with troops in Iraq would make similar statements as Washington attempted to create a united front against the insurgency. </p> <p>The US state department's announcement was an attempt to try and stop the spate of hostage-takings in Iraq. </p> <p>The interim Iraqi government said kidnappings had increased following Manila's early withdrawal of its 51 troops last month following kidnappers' threats to behead a captured Filipino truck driver. </p> <p>In a move intended to show kidnappers that none of the 31 other countries with troops in Iraq would follow, the US vowed not to make concessions to hostage-takers. </p> <p>\"We are united in our resolve to make no concessions to terrorists nor succumb to terrorist threats ... we understand that conceding to terrorists will only endanger all members of the multinational force, as well as other countries who are contributing to Iraqi reconstruction and humanitarian assistance,\" the statement said. </p> <p>Private foreign firms and employees involved in reconstruction work in Iraq have been driven away by the country's security problems. More than 60 foreigners have been kidnapped in recent months, with a significant number of those having been killed. </p> <p>The US policy statement came hours after four Jordanian hostages - three drivers and a businessman - were yesterday rescued from their kidnappers in a raid led by a tribal chief.</p> <p>Gunmen stormed the kidnappers' building in Falluja, forcing them to flee and freeing the four Jordanians.</p> <p>The raid - in a city that has long been hostile to the US military and supportive of Saddam Hussein - was the first time local gunmen had rescued foreign hostages. The gunmen described the kidnappers as \"terrorists\" and outsiders.</p> <p>Two Turkish drivers were reportedly released yesterday because their firm had agreed to stop working in Iraq.</p> <p><b>Five killed in police station attack</b></p> <p>Three militants this morning attacked a police station south of Baghdad. Two opened fire at guards while the third drove an explosives-laden minibus towards the building, killing five people and wounding 27, the Iraqi interior ministry said. </p> <p>The two gunmen escaped from the scene after the attack, Sabah Kadhim, an interior ministry spokesman, said. </p> <p>The attack, in the town of Mahawil, 85km (53 miles) from the Iraqi capital, was the latest in a spate of bombings to target police.</p>",
  "<p>Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate, has offered his most detailed plans yet to halve the US budget deficit while increasing spending on healthcare and education.</p> <p>Healthcare is a major ingredient of Mr Kerry's programme. He wants to extend health coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans while reducing premiums for the insured - a proposal that will cost $650bn (\u00a3357bn) over 10 years. He also wants to spend more than $200bn on education.</p> <p>To pay for that spending, Mr Kerry plans to claw back the recent tax cuts for the roughly 3% of the US population with incomes above $200,000, although he will make tax cuts for the middle class permanent. </p> <p>So, for a start, his tax plans are fairer. According to a non-partisan thinktank, the Tax Policy Centre, the largest tax cuts would go middle and upper middle income households, while those earning more than $1m would face a substantial tax increase, at an average of more than $93,503 more in tax in 2005. The Democratic candidate's tax plans would also cost less. The Tax Policy Centre calculates that his plan would cut tax revenues by around $602bn over 10 years, including $361bn to make the middle class tax cuts permanent. </p> <p>That compares with Mr Bush's budget plans, which would slash revenues by $1240bn, of which around $990bn can be attributed to making most of the 2001 and 20003 tax cuts permanent.</p> <p>In pushing his plan, Mr Kerry has harked back to the Clinton years, saying he would bring back the kinds of policies that brought about sustained economic growth and a balanced federal budget. </p> <p>His economic advisers certainly include many Clinton alumni, including Robert Rubin, the urbane former Treasury Secretary, and the former national economic adviser Laura Tyson. </p> <p>Moreover, Mr Kerry yesterday issued a list of some 200 business figures who are backing him, including the former Hollywood mogul Barry Diller and Peter Chernin, the chief operating officer of News Corporation, to boost his business-friendly image.</p> <p>As Mr Kerry points out, the US enjoyed a big budget surplus when Mr Clinton was in the White House. </p> <p>Now, however, the nation has a big budget deficit. The White House last week said it expected this year's budget gap to reach $445bn - less than it had previously estimated, but still a record in dollar terms. </p> <p>But Mr Kerry should not too be too quick to claim that he will restore fiscal responsibility to the White House. While the fact that his tax proposals put the onus on richer Americans, making them fairer, his spending plans - especially on health insurance coverage - will put pressure on government coffers.</p> <p>\"On balance, these elements of the two plans would add roughly the same amount to the federal debt over the decade,\" says the Tax Policy Centre.</p> <p>True, Mr Kerry has pledged to raise money from eliminating \"corporate welfare\" and closing tax loopholes that he says will lead to $500bn in savings over 10 years. But if the Republicans retain control of the House and the Senate, he will have a tough time achieving the changes he wants. </p> <p>The Kerry-Edwards team has also ruled out spending cuts from swathes of the budget, limiting their freedom of manoeuvre. They say they are committed to ensuring domestic discretionary spending does not grow faster than inflation. </p> <p>In the next breath, however, they say that defence, homeland security, health, education, medicare (health care for the elderly), social security (state pensions) and other mandatory programmes are off limits for cuts. Talk about tying one hand behind your back.</p> <p>Total discretionary spending for this year under the Bush budget will come to $875bn. Of that, education, homeland security, health and defence come to $605bn. </p> <p>Making defence safe from spending cuts seems odd, unless it is designed to reinforce the point that Mr Kerry would make a tough commander-in-chief. That is a shame, because he would save a quick $10bn if he axed the national missile defence programme - known as son of Star Wars - which has \"white elephant\" written all over it.</p> <p>In the end, the figures that his team is bandying about will probably be soon forgotten, even if he gets to the White House. </p> <p>Economic growth is the key to whether the budget deficits come down or not. If the economy grows at around 4% annually, the pool of red ink will dry up. </p> <p>Whoever is installed in the White House after November will probably have less influence in that respect than Alan Greenspan, the man at the Federal Reserve, and whoever succeeds him.</p> <p>What really worries analysts is whether the Fed has allowed inflationary pressures to build up too fast. If this proves to be the case, it will have to drop its \"measured approach\" and raise interest rates more aggressively. That would inevitably put the brakes on the economy, and would really blow a hole in the deficit.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mark Tran is the business editor of Guardian Unlimited</p>",
  "<p>More than a year since the rules on how public listed companies should be run were revised to encourage more diversity and greater technical skills in the boardroom, what exactly has changed?</p> <p>Not much - yet, is the simple answer.</p> <p>While there is cautious optimism that change will come, business leaders are at present happy to take a walking-before-running stance. </p> <p>Iain Richards, head of governance and public policy at Morley Fund Management, a large UK asset manager, says it is important to recognise that these are still early days.</p> <p>\"We are interested in a measured and thoughtful approach being taken by companies, rather than seeing quick 'form-over-substance' changes\", he says.</p> <p>When Britain's combined code on corporate governance - the rulebook on how public listed companies ought to be run - was changed in July 2003, the move was designed to prevent an Enron-style scandal in Britain.</p> <p>The changes incorporated most of the recommendations of Derek Higgs, the respected investment banker, who had produced a review of boardroom behaviour in January.</p> <p>He called for greater transparency and accountability in company boardrooms; a formal performance appraisal of boardrooms and \"closer relationships between non-executive directors and shareholders\". </p> <p>Mr Higgs also called for all boards to put in place a more rigorous appointments process for non-executive directors. </p> <p>Non-executive directors are supposed to advise corporate boards on strategy and act as a check on executive directors who might be prone to conflict of interest when it comes to their own salaries, bonus levels and employment contracts. </p> <p>In the case of Enron, non-executive directors clearly did not keep a close eye on the company books.</p> <p>Peter Montagon, head of investment affairs at the Association of British Insurers, an investor lobby group that represents around 20% of the UK stock market, agrees with Mr Richards that it may be too early to assess real changes driven by the Higgs review.</p> <p>Mr Montagon points out that the Higgs review was designed to encourage companies to think about the right role for non-executive directors in the long term and was not designed to push wholesale changes overnight.</p> <p>However, he says, in the short time since boards began looking at the new combined code, there has been \"probably more consultation with shareholders on some of these issues than in the past\".</p> <p>Mr Montagon names Barclays as one company with which the ABI held an extended dialogue over the appointment of Matt Barrett as chairman, after he finishes his stint as chief executive. ABI described the dialogue as extremely \"helpful\".</p> <p>While there was some resistance from business groups such as the CBI to some of the original Higgs recommendations, these were to the initial drafting. Since amendments were made to the revised combined code the CBI now says it entirely supports the new code as a \"voluntary\" initiative.</p> <p>Patricia Peter of the Institute of Directors says that the new combined code is best described as guidelines for best practice and should not be overly prescriptive. \"If you make rules very strict, silly anomalies creep in and sometimes the best people (for a particular role) have to leave,\" she says.</p> <p>Corporate boards also have concerns about what is expected of them by investors under the new code, which has yet to take effect for most companies.</p> <p>Other areas of concern for investors and company managers are the demands placed on non-executives and the availability of candidates with the required skills. </p> <p>These must be strategic allied with some technical knowledge, so that non-executives can properly serve on company audit or remuneration committees.</p> <p>In this area, says Mr Montagon, there is no silver bullet: \"We've got to feel our way a bit\".</p> <p>Chris Hodge of the corporate governance unit of the financial reporting council's (FRC) - the accountancy regulator - says the FRC will undertake an informal review of how the new combined code is taking effect during 2004.</p> <p>He also believes it is too early to assess the impact of the Higgs review, as many companies will still be reporting under the 1998 combined code rules in 2004, depending on when their financial year begins.</p> <p>Montagon of the ABI sums up the mood of the investing community in the post-Higgs era when he says: \"If anybody thought that 10 or 11 months on there would be radical change then I think they were probably misunderstanding the situation from the outset.\"</p> <p>Just as important to investors and companies alike, is the stress on board diversity. Everyone seems to agree that this is a key area, but equally no one wants do it in a way that harms the entrepreneurial spirit.</p> <p>\"We would not be likely to support a quota system,\" says Peter Montagon of the ABI. \"We've had the former archbishop of Canterbury suggesting there should be clergymen on boards. I don't think a bishop on every board is going to help - but some bishops might be very good directors.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tobias Webb is the editor of Ethical Corporation magazine and <a href=\"http://www.ethicalcorp.com\">Ethical Corporation</a> online, a free news website on corporate responsibility.</p>",
  "<p>Being a sniper is a stressful business: your heart pounds, you can hear yourself breathing, and you may even get butterflies in the stomach. But it's not the only way to buy things on eBay, the online auction site, and it's much less important than doing a bit of research before you hit that seductive button and submit your bid. </p> <p>\"Sniping\" is when you, the eBay bounty hunter, appear from nowhere and put in a winning bid just a few seconds before the auction closes. You can do it by watching the clock or using a utility such as Snip (<a href=\"http://www.snip.pl/en/\">www.snip.pl/en/</a>), Powersnipe.com or Auctionsniper.com. Either way, it really annoys people who have been bidding against one another for a week or so, but it only works because they are doing it wrong. </p> <p>A good rule of thumb for surviving eBay, is this: never make more than one bid in any auction. Decide how much you are willing to pay, bid that amount as late as you can, then forget about it until the auction closes. </p> <p>What confuses newbies is that they think eBay works like an auction house, such as Sotheby's. It doesn't, for two reasons. First, eBay will bid on your behalf. Second, auctions don't end when the highest possible bid has been achieved, but when the clock runs out. That encourages people to leave bidding until the last moment. If there is more than one bidder, the price of the item can easily double in the last three minutes. </p> <p>Suppose there is a CD you want, listed with a starting bid of \u00a31.99. The most you are willing to pay is \u00a310, so that is what you should bid. However, your bid will appear as \u00a31.99, which is what you will pay if no one else bids. If they do, the eBay proxy bidder will keep raising your bid until someone bids more than \u00a310, and eBay will send you an automated email to say you have been outbid. If that happens, you should move on: the CD was worth more to them than you. </p> <p>There is no point in saying: \"Oh, I would have paid more.\" If you thought it was worth more, you should have bid more in the first place. Indeed, it is only because people bid \u00a310 for something they think is worth \u00a315 that snipers can nip in and grab the loot for \u00a310.50. </p> <p>The problem then boils down to deciding how much something is worth. This is a personal matter: that rare Kraftwerk CD single could be worth 30p or \u00a3300, if you are a rabid fan and/or serious collector. To get a more objective view, there are three essential searches to do before you bid: two on eBay, and one on Google. </p> <p>The most important page on eBay is the one called Advanced Search. Your first search is for the item you plan to bid for. You may find it is a common item, and there are four examples available at different prices. This can save you bidding \u00a325 for something when a 99p version is a few days away. </p> <p>To run the second essential search, go to where it says \"Item type\" and check the box marked \"Completed items only\". This will find the examples that have been sold in the past 90 days, and tell you how much they went for. This establishes the market price, and gives you a good idea how much you can expect to pay. </p> <p>What typically happens on eBay is that, as a result of a bidding war, something goes for a silly price. This prompts other sellers to offer the same thing. The next example may go for 30% less, the next for half the price, and so on. Unless you are in a hurry, it's almost always cheaper to wait. </p> <p>Millions of items go through eBay, and most come up time after time. If what you want is attracting ridiculous bids, just wait for the next one. </p> <p>The third search is run on Google or possibly Amazon to find out how much it would cost to buy the item elsewhere. It's often ignorance that makes people pay over the odds. On eBay, boxed sets of classical CDs can go for more than EMI's new price, and hi-fi equipment can fetch more than Superfi's sale price. It doesn't matter if someone paid \u00a3600 for a product three years ago if Richer Sounds is knocking out new ones for \u00a3149. </p> <p>The main drawback with searching is that you can't rely on eBay sellers to spell Hilary Hahn (or whatever) correctly. </p> <p>Also, bear in mind that the auction price on eBay is not the final price, since you will usually have to pay post and packing. Charges can vary - from \u00a31 to \u00a32.50 for a CD, and from \u00a310 to \u00a325 for larger items. The \"Completed items\" search will give you a good idea of what's reasonable. </p> <p>Finally, you have to think about the seller. eBay has a reputation-based feedback system, which encourages people to describe their products accurately and ship them quickly. You should look to see what your seller has sold before, and how buyers felt about what they got. Look for 98% positive feedback or better, and read the comments. </p> <p>For more expensive items, it is always worth emailing the seller with a question: a fast, sensible reply can help you bid with confidence. If the seller sounds clueless or slightly dodgy, wait for the next one. </p> <p>There is much more to eBay than this, of course, so it could well be worth investing \u00a39.99 in David Belbin's The eBay Book, which is billed as the only UK guide.

  "<p>The government's proposed reforms of child welfare services in England will cost up to \u00a3100m, according to research published today.</p> <p>A survey of 121 local authority directors of education and social services found that the reforms proposed in the children bill are estimated to cost each council up to more than \u00a31m, or between \u00a370m and \u00a3100m nationally.</p> <p>It found that 14% of respondents estimated the cost to be in excess of \u00a31m, 18% thought it would be \u00a3500,000-\u00a31m, 33% between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3500,000 and just 4% less than \u00a3100,000. But 30% admitted they had no idea how much the reforms would cost.</p> <p>The report by local authority data experts RSe Consulting found that 62% of respondents considered the costs to present a substantial challenge to implementing the proposed legislation, which includes setting up children's trusts bringing together health, education, social services and other agencies.</p> <p>The findings contradict claims by the children's minister, Margaret Hodge, that reform of children's services will be cost neutral due to better joint working and pooling of resources. </p> <p>The survey, carried out in June, also found widespread concern over government proposals to set up electronic files on every child in England in a bid to identify vulnerable children before they reach crisis point. </p> <p>More than half (55%) of respondents said issues around data protection and information sharing present a significant challenge to plans for councils to set up local databases of these files.</p> <p>More than two thirds (68%) of respondents believe the proposal to set up local children's trusts, pooling the budgets of education, social services, some health services and other childcare and youth agencies, would improve the lives of vulnerable children, while 58% said it would help children at risk of abuse. But a third believe the trusts will have no impact.</p> <p>A substantial proportion of respondents believe the police (37%), voluntary and community groups and health services (27%) are still not as committed to partnership working as they should be.</p> <p>But there was overwhelming support for the aim of the children bill, with 82% of respondents stating the proposed policies were \"fundamentally sound\".</p> <p>The children bill will require councils to appoint children's directors to take strategic responsibility for local children's education, health and social services, while a senior councillor must take political responsibility for local children. </p> <p>Local authorities will also be enabled to merge their education and social services departments in a bid to provide a more integrated and holistic service for children and families.

  "<p>The timetable for the eagerly awaited float of internet search giant Google, which will value the company at up to \u00a320bn, could be temporarily derailed after it admitted it may have illegally issued shares to employees and consultants.</p> <p>In a routine filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, in which the company is obliged to disclose anything that may affect the valuation of the company, it said it had sold 23.2 million shares worth up to $3.1bn to 1,105 consultants and former employees. It has also issued a total of 5.6 million stock options to 301 people. </p> <p>However the transactions, which took place over the last three years, were not registered as required by law. Google has offered to buy back the shares for $25.9 million but has warned that some stockholders may prefer to sue the company rather than accept the buyback. </p> <p>The offer to buy back the shares would expire in September, it said, and those who did not respond to the buy back offer would have their shares automatically registered following the initial public offering, which was slated to take place as soon as next week. </p> <p>The company said it may have broken federal securities laws and the securities laws of 18 states and the District of Columbia by failing to register the stock and options or exempt them from registration. </p> <p>Google, the most popular internet search site in the world handling over 200 million searches a day, is in a closed period prior to the IPO and it was not clear whether the timing of the float would be affected by the legal oversight. In the filing, it said that it planned to conduct the IPO \"as soon as is practicable\". </p> <p>Google, which included its company motto \"Don't be evil\" in its IPO literature, is using a \"Dutch auction\" process for the IPO in an effort to democratise the process. The registration process is already open. </p> <p>The company and its lead underwriters, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley, will determine the highest price at which there is demand for all shares, and price the shares at or below that price</p> <p>However, major investment funds have been advising their clients to steer clear of the float, concerned that public appetite for the stock could over-inflate the initial share price in an echo of the dotcom boom days of 1999. </p> <p>Google's flotation will make billionaires of its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the Stanford University graduates who dreamed up the idea in a garage in 1998. </p> <p>They will each own about 16% of Google's voting power after the offering - Mr Brin plans to sell 962,226 shares, while Mr Page is expected to sell 964,830 shares. The founders, along with chief executive Eric Schmidt, and board members John Doerr and Michael Moritz will between them have just over 55% of voting rights. </p> <p>Stockholders planning to sell shares as part of the IPO include Time Warner's America Online unit and Yahoo!, which are both intending to sell 10% of their stakes. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>I believe that poetry can help to make you better. Poetry is essential, not a frill or a nicety. It comes to all of us when we most need it. As soon as we are in any kind of crisis, or anguish, that is when we reach out for poetry, or find ourselves writing a poem for the first time. </p> <p>I am currently \"fellow in health and literature\" in the English School of Newcastle University, and I have been exploring how creative writing, particularly poetry, can be used in a health context. I got involved with this kind of work through my own experience. I have advanced breast cancer, and poetry is what keeps me afloat. Without poems my journey through chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the general ups and downs of illness, would have been unthinkable. </p> <p>But why is poetry so important? Why do people who have never read or written a poem in their lives find themselves suddenly searching for a poetic language to make sense of a bereavement, a difficult diagnosis, or a change in their lives? </p> <p>First, poetry uses images to make us see things in a fresh way. So in the case of the physical body, poetry shows us pictures and metaphors that we can use, rather like visualisations. In my case I chose to imagine my body as a house, and wrote many poems during my treatment about \"living in the new extension\" or about my fears: Sudden Collapses in Public Places. Poetry helped me to step out of the difficult present and to use my imagination to be somewhere else. Once you have found a metaphor that works, you can explore and adjust it, creating new views, opening other doors, building scaffolding, and feeling more in control of your body. </p> <p>One of the hardest things about being unwell is feeling disempowered and out of control. Writing poetry can make you feel in charge again. Also, many of the poems I wrote were begun in waiting rooms. Waiting for an appointment can make one feel hopeless and helpless, and I found that doing some absorbing creative activity in the waiting room completely altered the experience. </p> <p>Poetry also gives us form. It provides a structure that can contain chaos and difficulty. It can make a mess manageable. When I work with doctors and patients using poetry we often use simple poetic forms, such as sonnets or haikus, to write about our experiences. I love the atmosphere in a room when a group of people are working on the making of a poem. It has a lovely honey calmness about it. Writers can take their scribblings, diaries and notes and develop these into a poetic shape. </p> <p>There is something very soothing about working out the jigsaw of a poem, even though the subject matter might be upsetting. Understanding and working with the craft of poetry frees us from the emotional glare of a situation and lessens our fears. Eventually you have a poem that you can carry around with you, that has the pleasing form of a well-made object, which can communicate itself to others without frightening them off. </p> <p>Poetry is the pioneer of language, and we can express things in new ways. One of the things I have found most interesting is developing new vocabularies for pain. The language of pain is overused and cliched (sharp, nagging, throbbing). If we employ a new language it is immediately effective and almost shocking. My hot flushes are like a thousand red ants marching up my body. My joints are rusty cranes. My spine is deep frozen. </p> <p>We can use this new vocabulary to communicate to others what our pain is like. For doctors this can be incredibly helpful. So much can be lost or misunderstood in a medical consultation, and often doctors and patients cannot find a language to communicate effectively with one another. Try describing your arthritis to your doctor using, perhaps, the vocabulary of music, or fishing. </p> <p>Lastly, poetry is all about music and rhythm, and music comforts and lulls us. The process of writing can be described as a way of bringing different parts of someone together, of literally creating harmony. The cadences and rhythms of poetry calm us and allow us to relax. Sometimes I do an exercise which asks participants to think of an important rhythm from their past. For me the sound of trains chugging in the distance was always a very happy sound. Then we write using that rhythm, creating poems that echo somewhere inside us. </p> <p>Poetry should be part of every modern hospital, and not just something to keep patients amused. It's a powerful force, which can help us through the darkest times. I would like to see more writers-in-residence in the health system, more poetry books in waiting rooms, more poems on the walls, more training in creative writing for doctors, and more poems printed on primary care leaflets. Poetry can save lives. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Julia Darling is a novelist (The Taxi Driver's Daughter; Penguin) and poet (Sudden Collapses in Public Places; Arc Press) </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.juliadarling.co.uk\">www.juliadarling.co.uk</a></p>",
  "No one is more vulnerable than a prisoner held beyond the reach of the law. So the grim picture of life as a US detainee, held without charge or trial, set out in the Guardian yesterday by three Britons should come as no surprise. It was Lord Steyn, a senior law lord steeped in the need to use words with care, who described the US treatment of its 600 Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees as \"a monstrous failure of justice\". Red Cross monitors who visited the detention camp last year described the interrogations there as \"not quite torture, but as close as you can get\". Yesterday it said the repeated abuses set out in a dossier compiled by lawyers of the \"Tipton three\", would amount to war crimes if proved true. The three were released from the camp in March after two years in US custody without access to lawyers. <p>The Britons allege repeated beatings, interrogation at gunpoint, sleep deprivation, humiliations including being forced to pose naked for photographs, and long hours on short shackles in painful squatting positions. The British suspects were released just weeks before the US supreme court belatedly ruled that detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay must be given access to US courts. The dossier raises questions which not only US officials need to answer but British diplomats and military chiefs too. </p> <p>The Foreign Office claimed no British detainees had complained about their treatment but all three said they made either written or verbal complaints to British consular staff, who made several visits to the camp to ensure the welfare of the nine British citizens held there. The Ministry of Defence moved more quickly than the FO yesterday, promising to investigate an incident in which one of the men said he had been interrogated by a man identifying himself as an SAS officer while an American guard held a gun to his head. There are questions too for the security services with allegations that MI5 agents were involved in interrogations ignoring the conditions under which suspects were held. </p> <p>The release of the dossier coincided with publication of a separate report yesterday on the UK's own \"Guant\u00e1namo Law\" - section four of the 2001 Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act. This allows foreign suspects to be held here without charge or trial. The parliamentary joint committee on human rights' report calls for the repeal of this section and points to its \"corrosive effect on the culture of respect for human rights in Britain\". It endorses the recommendations of a special committee of privy counsellors, asked by David Blunkett to review the act last year, which called for the internment provisions to be replaced \"as a matter of urgency because they increase the risk of a miscarriage of justice\". </p> <p>Thanks to a sunset clause inserted by the Liberal Democrats into the 2001 act the home secretary has been forced to engage in a consultation exercise on what should happen after November, 2006, when the law must lapse or be renewed. Mr Blunkett has already had to drop his plan to put terrorist suspects on trial while reducing the standard of proof as well as a plan to hold pre-emptive trials with secret evidence heard before vetted counsels. Both the attorney general and director of public prosecutions opposed this ambition. </p> <p>Two independent committees have now set out a serious alternative to internment - with more use of conventional criminal prosecution, relaxation of the ban on the use of intercept material; greater use of overt surveillance; and a wider use of civilian restriction orders. The UK remains the only state in the 45-member Council of Europe to introduce detention without charge or trial. We had to opt out of the European convention on human rights to do so. A return to the fold - by a repeal of section four - is long overdue.</p>",
  "<p>After decades of encouraging people to scream their lungs out on white-knuckle rides, Alton Towers theme park, has been ordered by a judge to 'keep the noise down'. In particular, the park must try to cut out some of the shrieks from a near-vertical plunge ride called Oblivion. </p> <p>Short of closing the rides, what can Alton Towers do? \"Normally we try to control the noise at source,\" says Barry Gibbs, an expert on noise control from the Acoustic Research Unit at Liverpool University. \"In this case that would mean gagging the riders.\" Given that this might reduce the appeal of the ride Alton Towers may have to think of another solution. </p> <p>Enclosing the riders inside a cabin is one possibility, so that the screams are contained. \"I imagine that the lack of wind through the hair would remove much of the thrill,\" says Gibbs. Another option might be to use barriers. These commonlyhave a wood or steel outer layer and an absorbent inner material, such as a mineral fibre or fireproof fabric. </p> <p>\"Blocking the line of sight between the noise and the listener reduces the sound by about 5-10 decibels, which would probably make the screams sound about half as loud as they are now,\" says Gibbs. Given that many of the rides are very high and much of the riders' excitement comes from seeing where they are going, it probably won't be practical to build a barrier around entire rides, but sound shields could be placed at crucial points. \"This would produce a tunnel effect around the screams,\" says Gibbs. </p> <p>A more extreme solution would be to re-organise the arrangement of the rides so that the noisier rides are near the centre of the park, increasing the distance between screaming riders and nearby residents, sitting peacefully in their gardens. If none of those noise reduction methods appeals, Alton Towers could offer nearby householders extra soundproofing. \"Houses could be fitted with double windows, not just double-glazing, but a special construction with as much as a 10cm gap between the glass,\" explains Gibbs.</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England today stuck to its \"gradualist\" policy as it raised interest rates by a quarter-point to 4.75%, its fifth increase since November. </p> <p>The quarter-point rise was widely expected amid signs that the Bank's incremental approach was having some impact on the buoyant housing sector. </p> <p>In a statement, the Bank said: \"Output growth has been robust and business surveys point to continued expansion. Although the housing market remains buoyant, there are now signs that it is starting to ease, and the growth of consumption may be moderating. Investment and public sector consumption have both grown strongly and demand in UK export markets continues to pick up.\"</p> <p>The Halifax bank yesterday reported that the monthly increases in property prices had eased during the past two months. The Halifax said prices rose by 1.3% in July following a 1.2% increase in June, well down on the 2%-plus rises earlier in the year. </p> <p>The Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) does not target house prices as such but is worried that an unsustainable property boom could result in a crash that would have repercussions for the wider economy.</p> <p>Some economists have argued that it would take a 50 basis point rise to really slow down the housing market and curb consumer borrowing, which last month broke the \u00a31 trillion mark. </p> <p>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) last week criticised the Bank's \"gradual approach\" as an ineffective way of keeping inflation in check.</p> <p>\"This rather leisurely tightening of monetary policy ... will have done little to ensure that inflation is not expected to rise sharply,\" said the NIESR, as it urged the Bank to raise borrowing costs by a half-percentage point.</p> <p>But Bank officials have made it clear their preference for a gradual approach. Charlie Bean, one of the nine MPC members, said last week there was no evidence that \"a single large increase in rates\" was more effective in damping down consumer spending than two smaller hikes. The Bank was \"not in the business of trying to clobber the consumer, Mr Bean said.</p> <p>\"We suspect that there was serious discussion within the MPC about a 50 basis point interest rate hike. It is likely that the minutes of the meeting will strongly hint that a further 25 basis point hike will occur in September unless there is very clear evidence over the next month that the housing market really is now cooling and that consumer borrowing and spending is moderating,\" said Howard Archer of Global Insight.</p> <p>Manufacturing data released this morning will probably have reinforced the MPC's gradualist leanings. Manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in June, although the three-month growth rate remained positive, the Office for National Statistics reported.</p> <p>The ONS said manufacturing output fell 0.7% on the month in June, on the back of significant drops in output of the basic metals and transport equipment industries, after rising sharply in April and May. </p> <p>Industry surveys have also showed a slowing of growth in the manufacturing sector in June, but a strong recovery in July. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply manufacturing survey showed the sector growing at its fastest pace in 10 years in July.</p>",
  "<p>Console to mobile phone conversions have been patchy so far with some considerable successes (Gameloft's Tom Clancy titles) and more than a few abject failures. UK outfit 8Bit games is currently working on bringing Pivotal's excellent squad-based shooters, Conflict: Desert Storm and Conflict: Vietnam, to Java phones. So what limitations does the team face, and what \u2013 if anything \u2013 can they salvage from the gameplay experience of the console originals? I talked to the company's Business Development Director, Dave Vout\u2026</p> <p><strong>How are you bringing across the team-based nature of the Conflict gameplay?</strong> You always take out two of the four troops and switch between them, it's a little different in Desert Storm to Vietnam but eventually it's the same principle. you then issue commands to the other soldier - for example wait, follow, stealth, etc. If you tell him to follow in stealth mode and you're half the map away, he will find the best route through the map using the best cover and avoiding being seen. We think the AI is quite advanced for a mobile game, it's little touches like people stepping to the side to let another person past, common place in a console title but in a mobile game traditionally he'd just walk over the top!</p> <p>The different soldiers have different skills and weapons, too, so for an example of gameplay, you walk soldier one over the bridge and pickup the C4 explosives, switch to soldier 2 and walk him over the bridge, switch to sniper rifle, aim the cursor at the guard and bam he's dead, switch back to the first soldier and walk him to the bridge, drop the C4, issue the 'follow me' command and walk away from the bridge. Press 5 and, boom, the bridge explodes\u2026 and so on.</p> <p><strong>Will you be using a similar mission-based structure to the console versions?</strong> All of the missions are the same as the console versions, we took the mission descriptions and then built mini versions of them. We've had to trim it a bit, but basically if you've played the console version you'll recognise the mobile missions, but won't know how to complete them!</p> <p><strong>What weapons and vehicles might we see in the game?</strong> There are close combat weapons like knives for stealth missions, short-range weapons like the Desert Eagle and long-range sniper rifles; each has a role. Then there are heavy explosives, rocket launchers, grenades, all with a blast radius so you have to be careful with them. We intend to put in tanks and all manner of vehicles, but they are not there yet so I can't say for sure. In Vietnam we're planning two vehicle-based missions, one onboard a helicopter and one on a boat, where you control the machine guns picking off everything in your way.</p> <p><strong>How are you transferring the quite complex control system to the mobile platform?</strong> Well as with all our games, the controls evolve and change throughout development, reacting to suggestions from the final QA guys, so I expect it'll change again before we finish. Basically, though, the games are played top-down - this is a favourite of mine, I see lots of games going down the technology route at the moment forgetting about the gameplay experience. Back when we worked on the old home computers and had very similar restrictions, most games played well - things only went wrong when people started to introduce fancy techniques to a system that couldn't cope. So bearing that in mind, we've chosen top-down with rotate and walk. All bullets home to their target within a few degrees and there's a fair bit of background AI to control the gameplay and prevent the player feeling frustrated by the restrictions of single button mobiles. This way the game plays as well on a basic Nokia as it does on a SE K700. So the gameplay, in its most basic form, is 'move here, fire at that, pickup this, do special action, switch soldiers', with plenty of variety, story and puzzles.</p> <p><strong>It seems that these titles are much more ambitious than many of the console conversions we've seen.</strong> We were formed by ex-console games industry people and apply those same principles and techniques to mobile games. We never make throwaway games, and where some would liken mobile games to cups of coffee - pay \u00a35 play for 15 minutes and throw it away - we compare ours to Game Boy games, they are worth playing over and over again. They are games for gamers\u2026</p> <p><strong>What do you have planned after the Conflict titles?</strong> We are about to announce another console to mobile title, plus we are starting work on a trilogy of horror games, and a special ops strategy game that's got some cool features. There are plenty of other things happening but I can't talk about them right now. We've also been nominated for the Develop award for best handheld/mobile studio and that's quite an achievement after only 7 months trading!</p> <p>Conflict: Vietnam is out in September. Conflict: Desert Storm arrives the following month.</p>",
  "Pressure was mounting last night on the home secretary, David Blunkett, to drop his plans to extend his emergency powers to detain international terror suspects that became law in the immediate aftermath of September 11. <p>The all-party human rights committee of MPs and peers yesterday called for their repeal, saying the internment powers were inherently discriminatory because they only targeted foreign nationals. </p> <p>The report from the joint committee, chaired by Labour MP Jean Corston, warned that the long-term \"opt-out\" from the European Convention on Human Rights needed to underpin the use of the emergency powers has had \"a corrosive effect on the culture of respect for human rights\". </p> <p>The parliamentarians also voice concern about the use of evidence obtained under torture in these cases and the mounting evidence of the disproportionate impact of the use of counter-terrorism powers on the Muslim community. </p> <p>The committee concluded that Mr Blunkett's internment powers \"should be replaced as a matter of urgency by measures which do not include indefinite administrative detention\". </p> <p>The report goes on: \"If the threat from international terrorism is to continue for the foreseeable future, the committee considers that an alternative way must be found to deal with that threat without derogating indefinitely from important human rights obligations,\" concludes the report. </p> <p>In fact, the MPs and peers give their support to a number of ideas the home secretary has floated that would allow some of those detained indefinitely to face criminal trials instead. </p> <p>For example, they agree that it is time to lift the self-imposed ban on the use of telephone tap and other intercept intelligence evidence in British courts. </p> <p>They also agree with Mr Blunkett that some \"modification\" of the ordinary criminal trial process may be needed to deal with the problem of using sensitive intelligence material as evidence in a criminal court. The MPs and peers acknowledge that many of these cases of suspected terrorism rest on intelligence material obtained by covert means. </p> <p>The human rights committee also argues for more use of intense overt surveillance of suspected terrorists as an alternative to their indefinite detention. The parliamentarians are also attracted to the use of civil restriction orders, being considered by Mr Blunkett, which would impose curfews, tagging, daily reporting requirements and other conditions. </p> <p>But they disagree with Lord Carlile, the Liberal Democrat peer who officially reviews the operation of the counter-terrorism laws, that a new specific offence of \"acts preparatory to terrorism\" would enable all those detained indefinitely to be put on trial. Lord Carlile repeated his call yesterday for Mr Blunkett to adopt the measure. </p> <p>They disagreed, saying it would not overcome the main obstacle to criminal prosecutions of suspected terrorists that some evidence could not be used in open court because it is based on highly sensitive intelligence material. </p> <p>The committee's inquiry included an international survey of legal responses to September 11 and found that no other country had derogated or \"opted out\" of its human rights obligations; the US is the only other country to resort to indefinite executive detention. The report concludes it must be possible to deal with the threat by means of criminal prosecution.</p>",
  "<p>The Tories yesterday accused the government of trying to \"fix\" the social class intake at some of Britain's top universities after it emerged last month that funding was being provided for medical students with lower than the standard minimum A-level grades. </p> <p>Medical degrees have long been dominated by middle-class students. The government and Hefce, the university funding body, say that such funding, in the form of grants, is an attempt to give students with the potential to excel as doctors more support once they get to university. </p> <p>Last month, the higher education minister, Alan Johnson, disclosed in an answer to a written question that places for around 80 students holding less than the usual requirement of three C-grades would be subsidised in 2004-05, to help ensure that they did not drop out. </p> <p>Around 20 universities including Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College and University College London are involved in the scheme, which funded 480 full-time medical students in 2003-04. </p> <p>Last year, \u00a3126,092 was allocated to the project and a further \u00a321,950 of Hefce's \u00a3159m budget will be spent in the next academic in a bid to get more working-class students through university. </p> <p>Chris Grayling, the higher education spokesperson for the Conservatives, said: \"It is quite absurd that the government is paying universities to admit students without the level of exam passes that they would normally need to study medicine. </p> <p>\"We should not be compromising our normal standards for medical students just to help meet the government's political targets in higher education. </p> <p>\"This also means that top quality students with good exam results are being denied the chance to study at leading medical schools simply because their social background doesn't fit the government's plans. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Mr Johnson said: \"The truth is, the money allocated for widening participation is not an incentive for universities to recruit students with lower A-level scores. It is money which assists universities with the additional costs of retaining able students from disadvantaged backgrounds once they have been recruited. </p> <p>\"Universities will always recruit students they see as having the talent and potential to succeed - it is not in their interest to recruit them otherwise. Medicine remains an extremely competitive subject.\" </p> <p>A Hefce spokesman said: \"Many universities with our support are committed to broadening the range of medical students to reflect better the needs of the diverse communities which are served by the NHS. </p> <p>\"Admissions decisions are a matter for the universities. They will make these decisions in the light of the particular circumstances of individual applicants and their potential to succeed.\"</p>",
  "<p>US marine Josh Rushing, who features in the documentary Control Room about al-Jazeera, has become a victim of the film's success. He plans to leave the US military because his superiors are displeased with his role in promoting the film. </p> <p>\"He did a few interviews that indicated he might not know what his lane is,\" a senior officer told the LA Times. The officer said Rushing had been asked not to make any further public comments about the film. </p> <p>In the film, Rushing says: \"It benefits al-Jazeera to play to Arab nationalism because that's their audience, just like [Fox News] plays to American patriotism, for the same reason - American nationalism - because that's their demographic audience.\" </p> <p>In May's Village Voice, Rushing said: \"People don't understand what a complex organisation al-Jazeera is. They say it's all Islamists, or Baathists, or Arab nationalists. [...] But you have progressive voices, too. Al-Jazeera shows it all. It turns your stomach, and you remember there's something wrong with war.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hospital keeps man in as M&amp;S fails to provide bed</strong><br> </p> <p>\"You can get a bed at the NHS. You can't get one at M&amp;S,\" begins LG Thomas's letter intriguingly. Now, that dear old bastion of the high street does not appear in this column very often, but, it seems, when it does mess up, it does so with verve. For the past five months, Thomas and his wife have been bedding down on the floor because they made the mistake of ordering a new bed from Marks &amp; Spencer. That was back in February. The store made vague noises of reassurance but the weeks passed and no bed arrived. Then Thomas fell seriously ill and spent three weeks in intensive care, after which the hospital was reluctant to discharge him because he did not have a bed to go home to. The patient liaison service got no more joy out of the store than he had and he was obliged to occupy a much needed hospital bed for his recuperation. He is now home and still waiting and says that whenever he rings M&amp;S for an update, no one has the faintest idea what he is referring to. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> M&amp;S blames \"supplier and quality issues\" for the delay, and it would have been mollifying if it had thought to communicate these to Thomas during the long months of suspense. Amazingly, these issues are miraculously resolved within three days of Consumer getting in touch, and Thomas has now been given a firm date for delivery and compensation for his sufferings. </p> <p><strong>Pre-booked Hertz hire car is 'not available'</strong><br> </p> <p>If you are lucky enough to check in for your holiday flight without a hitch, take off successfully and be reunited with your luggage on arrival, postpone any complacency. For the greatest hazard of all could still await you - that of collecting the hire car you so carefully booked back in the UK. </p> <p>Ryanair passenger Julia Glanville was urged to book her Hertz car through the airline when she bought her flight tickets, but discovering that she could get a cheaper deal if she approached Hertz herself, she went it alone. A few days before her departure she rang to check her reservation was in order and was assured a car would be waiting for her at the Italian airport of Brindisi. She need not have wasted her money on the call. When she presented herself at the hire desk late on Sunday night she learned that there was no car available, although, mysteriously, people in the queue behind her were allocated vehicles without a hitch. When she queried this, she was told that those who had booked through Ryanair took precedence. Eventually she and her two small children had to take pot luck with the only other hire company that had a desk open and she had to pay a good deal more than the Hertz price for a very inferior car. On her return, she rang Hertz, which made soothing noises, but has so far done nothing to explain or redeem the situation. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> According to Hertz's press office there was an unusual shortage of vehicles that night and although Ryanair passengers who had booked via the airline were not given preference, those who had prepaid for their car were. \"This is contrary to our emergency procedure and cars should have been allocated to pre-booked customers in the order in which they presented themselves at the rental desk,\" says a spokeswoman. \"Staff at this branch have been told to adhere to the correct procedure in future.\" Glanville has now been refunded the difference in price between the Hertz vehicle she had ordered and the one she was forced to hire from a rival company, plus compensation of $100 (\u00a355).</p> <p><strong>Beware an online booking with Europcar</strong><br> </p> <p>Christine de Poortere of London fears that the same predicament may await her, for while trying to book a car online with Europcar she noticed the following disturbing small print: \"Europcar shall bear no liability pursuant to the reservation available on the site ... in no event shall online reservation of a Europcar vehicle be treated as constituting a rental contract.\" Eh? But since the site demanded de Poortere's credit card details to secure her booking, she feels, reasonably enough, that she has entered into a contract and should be able to rely on a car being at her disposal. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Europcar explains that customers who book online are given the choice as to whether they enter a contract there and then by pre-paying the cost of the hire, or simply reserve a car and give their credit card details as security. Both types of booking carry their own terms and conditions and those who decide not to pre-pay are deemed not to have entered into a contract, although the press office promises that a car would always be available for them. </p> <p><strong>Made to pay twice for one trip on Midland Mainline</strong><br> </p> <p> How does a hard-pressed train operating company make a profit in these difficult times? Midland Mainline, whose curious ticketing practices were highlighted here last month, appears to have hit upon a win-win formula to fatten its coffers. Peter Gale pre-booked a saver ticket for a journey back in May but then waited in vain for it to arrive. </p> <p>On the day of travel, when there was still no sign of it, customer services advised Gale to purchase another ticket at the station and claim a refund later. This he did, but he has heard no more from Midland, which has pocketed a double fee from him. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The press office is more communicative than customer services and passes on profuse apologies. Better still, it organises the refund. \"We post tickets at least five days in advance,\" says a spokeswoman. \"After a recent investigation, we have made a few changes to the way tickets are dispatched and this has resulted in instances of lost tickets being reduced dramatically.\"</p> <p>Write to us at 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email us at <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Mark Curtis is a man with a secret. The new head of the World Development Movement is frank about his belief that lobbying ministers is a \"waste of time\" and his intention to turn to the type of direct action made famous by Greenpeace and anti-globalisation activists. But what he is planning, he won't say. </p> <p>\"We've seen the limits of traditional campaigning. It is the failure of the development lobby. We're now considering peaceful direct action,\" he tells me in the WDM's cramped south London headquarters. </p> <p>Boyish but academic, Mr Curtis does not only want the WDM to become more forceful; he also wants it to become more iconoclastic in its choice of campaigns, questioning the roles of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and even the benefits of aid itself. </p> <p>His reaction to the renewal this weekend of the Doha trade talks, which the developing world spectacularly allowed to collapse in the Mexican resort of Cancun last September, is characteristically sceptical. \"I think this time the developing nations took a calculated risk that they could get some concessions on the west's subsidies on agriculture and cotton, whereas if the talks just collapsed there would be none,\" he says. </p> <p>\"But these are just rhetorical concessions, not political commitments, and the past evidence is that these promises will never be implemented.\" </p> <p>But hasn't the government made progress on increasing aid and debt reduction? Aren't these things of which Labour party members would justifiably be proud? \"They would,\" he replies - \"and they would be absolutely, diametrically wrong. </p> <p>\"Labour has increased aid and been more progressive on debt relief, but all debt relief and, increasingly, aid is now tied to liberalisation. </p> <p>\"They are quite open and explicit about this; it is called \"conditionality\", and our view is that until conditionality ends there is no point increasing aid. Indeed, it's questionable whether aid is a good thing.\" </p> <p>Of his planned move into the world of abseiling protesters and street-stopping demos, he says: \"Development has never done this before. The environmentalists have; the peace campaigners against the arms trade have; but we have always been mild, and now we need to ratchet up a few gears. It's the final straw, but we've got to do it. </p> <p>\"Too many large NGOs have become close to government. Too much time is spent on inside lobbying, which has limited impact, and not enough telling their supporters that government is part of the problem.\" </p> <p>The World Development Movement is not quite like other aid organisations: it does not directly fund relief in the developing world in the manner of an Oxfam or a Christian Aid, and a \u00a320 donation to the WDM will not pay for a cataract operation in Africa or a clean water well in central America. Instead, funded mostly by its 14,000 members, the organisation campaigns for reform of the global economic system established at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, of which the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are two pillars. </p> <p>Mr Curtis, a former academic and research fellow at the establishment foreign policy thinktank Chatham House, led Christian Aid before taking over at the WDM two months ago. He puts it this way: \"The US and the UK developed in the 19th century behind trade barriers. So have some recent successful economies, such as South Korea, Taiwan and even Japan, whereas Africa is getting poorer under liberalisation. </p> <p>\"Protecting infant industries is now against the rules of the World Trade Organisation, yet it is the way countries build up their economies in the first place before entering into 'free trade'. Nobody actually believes in free trade: it is something you impose on others.\" </p> <p>He won't name names, but Mr Curtis believes it is time to change the approach of the charities he calls the household names of aid and development. Lobbying the government for more debt relief for impoverished nations, increases in aid and reform of the WTO must give way to outright direct action, he argues. </p> <p>The big five British overseas aid groups, Oxfam, Save the Children, Cafod, Action Aid and Christian Aid, have meetings four times a year with the secretary of state for international development, currently Hilary Benn. Curtis believes the access WDM gets is a pointless without a groundswell of public pressure for abolition, not just reform, of the WTO. </p> <p>The final straw came at the start of this month, when Patricia Hewitt, the secretary of state for trade and industry, published a white paper called Making Globalisation a Force for Good. \"This is the big government statement, and after 10 years it's simply a pure Thatcherite agenda,\" he says. </p> <p>He also has strong words for the mainstream media in Britain, which often portray the \"anti-globalisation movement\" - those involved prefer the more positive term \"global justice movement\" - as \"a bunch of white, middle-class lefties\". </p> <p>In fact, he says, the \"protests of the south\" are disgracefully unrepresented in the UK. (The preferred terminology these days in the development movement is \"the north\" for the western, developed world and \"the \"south\" or \"majority world\" for the developing nations.) </p> <p>\"We've published a report cataloguing 234 protests in 34 countries in the south. What you see going on in the north is only the tip of the iceberg. Most of the world is opposed to the corporate invasions of their country. </p> <p>\"What is encouraging is that we are living through the birth of the biggest, most unprecedented mass movement in history, the global justice movement. </p> <p>\"A hundred thousand people from around the globe are attending the world social forums and realising that what links our, admittedly smaller, problems in Europe - work insecurity, climate change, privatisation of public services - is the same model of corporate control. They pay a higher price, but we are all victims.\" </p> <p>Would WDM activists be willing to go to jail, then, for peaceful direct action? \"It's too early to say,\" he replies, guardedly. \"But the tactics of the environmentalists have worked: there are now votes to be won or lost on the environment whereas on development, there aren't. Time is running out and we need to change that.\" </p> <p>Curtis has one more secret up his sleeve: he is a respected author. His book Web of Deceit, published last year, examined the secret history of British foreign policy since the second world war through documents released under the 30-year rule. </p> <p>And he has a new book out in the autumn. Unpeople: Britain's Secret History of Human Rights Abuse will, he says, blow the lid off Britain's involvement in Vietnam, Chile, Iraq (in 1963, that is) and Uganda, with special revelations about the role of Denis Healey, defence secretary under Harold Wilson.</p>",

Announced back in March, this extremely gamer-friendly, Linux-based device is one of the first to include <a href=\"http://www.superscape.com\">Superscape</a>'s Swerve 3D engine - an advanced graphics solution that should allow Java developers to create PSone-quality 3D games. And that's just the start of this phone's mouthwatering specs list.</p> <p>Motorola's star performer also boasts an 8-way navigation controller \u2013 a feature still shockingly rare even among the most advanced entertainment handsets. Anyone who's tried to play a game that offers 360 degree movement will know how frustrating it is to use the number keys for diagonal movement, your fingers pinched together into a kind of hideous gaming claw. Then there's support for multiple simultaneous button presses \u2013 another gaming staple criminally ignored by most manufacturers. The multi-channel audio set-up also allows for both midi background music and MP3 sound effects \u2013 a far cry from the grinding monophonic dirges we usually have to put up with.</p> <p>Add MPEG4 video capture, VGA camera, FM radio and 1Gb of user-expandable memory, and you have the <em>the</em> mobile entertainment solution of the year. Well you do if you live in Asia or the United States. In the UK, we'll have to make do with the slightly more modest E398 (view the PDF fact sheet <a href=\"http://www.motorola.com/mot/doc/1/1083_MotDoc.pdf\">here</a>), another lifestyle device, this time aimed at hip young music lovers. Dual stereo surround-sound speakers and an integrated MP3 player are the key features, but the phone also includes, \"rhythm lights that interact with Java games, ringtones, caller ID and ambient noise\". Some people may consider \"rhythm lights\" a fair trade for 8-way gaming controls and a Superscape 3D engine. I am not sure, but then I haven't seen them in action.</p> <p>You could also check out the swish new <a href=\"http://www.motorola.com/mediacenter/news/detail/0,,4485_3818_23,00.html\">Motorola RAZR V3</a>, launched last week. This stunning clamshell <em>does</em> have a built-in 3D engine but Motorola has not yet confirmed whether it's Swerve-powered. But then, what does it matter when the phone itself is partly constructed from aircraft-grade aluminium, and includes a chemically-etched keypad and electroluminescent backlighting? This is going to be a handset to be seen with this year. Let's face it, we could all do with a little more electroluminescence in our lives.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the first UK handset to include a built-in Swerve 3D engine will probably be the <a href=\"http://www.siemens-mobile.com/cds/frontdoor/0,2241,hq_en_0_27139_rArNrNrNrN,00.html\">Siemens S65</a> due out in autumn. This quite stern-looking little device, seemingly aimed at business users, also offers a 1.3 mega-pixel camera and lots of PC synchronisation features.</p> <p>Superscape is certainly prepared for the arrival of Swerve-powered devices. The company has been busy creating its own 3D titles using its Swerve toolset and has nearly 30 titles either completed or in production, including Alien vs Predator and Fight Club.</p> <p>You can learn all about Swerve right <a href=\"http://www.superscape.com/products/faq/#\">here</a> .</p>",

  "A partially sighted student whose family had been repeatedly harassed by a \"racist\" gang was yesterday cleared of attacking one of the youths with a samurai sword. <p>Shamraiz Ali, 26, was accused of causing grievous bodily harm after Shane Stringer, 22, lost the use of two fingers when his hand was nearly severed as a drunken group gathered outside Mr Ali's family home in Peterborough. </p> <p>In a case that exposed how a gang called \"the Orton posse\" ran amok in the city's estates, King's Lynn crown court heard that seven white youths, including Mr Stringer, had more than 100 previous convictions between them, including actual bodily harm and racially motivated offences. </p> <p>As the only Asian family on the estate in Orton Goldhay, Mr Ali and his family had been beaten up in their own home, threatened with petrol bombs and had eggs thrown at their door. </p> <p>In July last year, Mr Ali, his sister-in-law and father were attacked in their council house by another member of the gang, Shane Farrington. Farrington was jailed for 27 months in May for the attack. </p> <p>A week later seven drunken youths, including Farrington and his friend, Mr Stringer, were \"play fighting\" outside Mr Ali's home when they said there was a \"sudden flash of violence in the dark\", and Mr Stringer's hand was nearly severed by a samurai sword. He needed a five-and-a-half hour operation and lost much of the use of two fingers. </p> <p>Despite no weapon ever being found and no blood or forensic evidence linking Mr Ali to the crime, Jeremy Benson, QC, for the defence, said the youths had conspired to accuse the student of maiming Mr Stringer, who described Mr Ali to police as a \"white Paki\". Mr Ali, who is studying history and politics at Anglia Polytechnic University, was born with a pigmentation disorder and has white skin. </p> <p>He was described as \"frail\" in court and his sight is severely impaired. </p> <p>While the prosecution argued that the gang was not made up of \"criminal geniuses\" and said three youths could not have quickly concocted a similar account of a samurai attack, Mr Benson said they were \"streetwise\" with experience of dealing with the police and courts. </p> <p>\"When things get difficult they always blame somebody else,\" he said. \"All they had to make up was that the injury was caused by the 'white Paki with the samurai sword'.\" </p> <p>Farrington had once stabbed himself with a samurai sword, while a similar sword was also found in the home of a relative of Mr Stringer, who had convictions for actual bodily harm, affray and other offences, the court heard. Mr Stringer denied he was racist or a member of \"the Orton posse\". His friend, Luke Brazil, admitted in court he was part of \"the Orton boys\". </p> <p>After assaulting Mr Ali's family in their home last year, Farrington told police: \"We were just walking past when the Asians came out and attacked us for no reason.\" Mr Benson said the three prosecution witnesses, Mr Stringer, Mr Brazil and Natasha Robinson, had concocted the same story again . </p> <p>Phone records showed Mr Ali had called the police three times as the gang gathered outside, unlike the youths, who did not phone for help even after Mr Stringer was badly injured. </p> <p>Outside the court, Mr Ali, who denied the charge, said of the verdict: \"I'm pleased because I have a future ahead of me and some people tried to jeopardise it for no reason.\"</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>LEADING AL-QAIDA OPERATIVE ARRESTED</b></p> <p>\"HEATHROW BOMB PLOT,\" splashes the Sun. \"Osama plan on suspect's laptop.\" The paper says that one of the 13 men seized in Tuesday's police raids in Luton, Blackburn, Bushey and north-west London was \"al-Qaida's UK chief ... codename Bilal\".</p> <p>The Telegraph, which suggests \"Bilal\" may have been picked up before the raids, says he uses the alias Abu Eisa Al Hindi.</p> <p>The arrest of a 25-year-old computer expert in Pakistan on July 13 led intelligence officials to \"Bilal\", the paper says. Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan admitted sending him encrypted messages, including plans of Heathrow airport.</p> <p>The news of the arrest comes at an opportune time for David Blunkett, whose plans to extend his emergency powers to hold foreign terrorist suspects were criticised by MPs and peers yesterday. It is unclear whether \"Bilal\" is a British citizen.</p> <p>\"The parliamentary committee should wake up to reality,\" says the Sun contemptuously. \"There's a war on ... What's your reaction when another batch of terrorist suspects is rounded up? Do you say 'Thank goodness' and sleep a little easier at night?

It is too early to repeal [these] provisions and it is wrong to wallow in self-indulgent cynicism about the drive against terrorism.\"</p> <p>The Telegraph is not particularly worried either: judging by the outcome of previous raids, \"most suspects will be free in a week\", it predicts. One of the 13 men has already been released.</p> <p>Nonetheless, says the FT, the MPs' report was the \"perhaps the loudest\" of the \"alarm bells sounded by critics since the legislation was rushed on to the statute book ...

  "<p>Henri Cartier-Bresson, universally acknowledged as one of the most influential photographers of the 20th century, was buried yesterday, two days after his unannounced death at home in the south of France. He was 95. </p> <p>\"He had not been eating for several days. He grew gradually weaker,\" a family member told reporters from the photographer's summer home in the village of L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. </p> <p>Cartier-Bresson, who gave up photography 30 years ago for his first love, painting and drawing, was the creator of 700,000 black-and-white photographs. He abhorred artificial lighting, including flash, never used a wide-angle lens, and never cropped his prints. </p> <p>A co-founder of the legendary Magnum photo agency, along with Robert Capa, David Seymour and George Rodger, he is seen today as the leader of that generation of photographers who succeeded in elevating what was until then a hobby, or at most a jobbing profession, into an art form. </p> <p>Among his most famous images, many of them on display at the foundation bearing his name that was opened in Paris last year, are the moustachioed, bowler-hatted man caught peeping through the canvas surround at a sports event in Brussels in 1932; a female prisoner denouncing a Gestapo informer in 1945; a boyish Truman Capote in 1947; and children playing on the Berlin wall in 1962. </p> <p>As a photojournalist, he had an astonishing ability to be in the right place at the right time: among the 1,000 original prints, as well as contact sheets, films, manuscripts and correspondence, at the foundation are shots taken during civil wars in Spain and Mexico, the communist revolution in China and at the death of Mahatma Gandhi in India. </p> <p>He was also a gifted portraitist, counting Jean-Paul Sartre, Carson McCullers, Bar bara Hepworth, Henri Matisse, Edith Piaf and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor among the famous names who sat for him. In 1954, he was the first western photographer allowed into the Soviet Union after the death of Stalin the previous year. </p> <p>Born in 1908, the son of a wealthy industrialist from Chanteloup, east of Paris, Cartier-Bresson took up photography in the 1930s: his first Leica (\"an extension of my eye\"), bought in 1932, was intended merely as an aid to his art. Much later he returned to this view, dismissing photography as \"un truc m\u00e9canique\" - a mechanical thing - and spending most of his time after 1974 drawing and copying paintings in Paris art galleries. </p> <p>But Cartier-Bresson's studies on design and proportion under the painter Andre Lhote, in the 1920s, proved fundamental to his photographic philosophy, as did his work on surrealism, a movement then at its height. </p> <p>From these two roots gradually grew his definition of what makes an exceptional image, the \"decisive moment\" - the name given to a major collection of his work in 1952. The \"decisive moment\", he said, was \"the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as the precise organisation of forms which give that event its proper expression\". </p> <p>Using one of the unobtrusive, fast-shooting cameras that became available from the 1930s, Cartier-Bresson began his hunt for the arresting image, setting the standard for every photojournalist who followed. He was, in his words, \"prowling the streets ... determined to trap life, to preserve life in the act of living\". </p> <p>Before the war he worked in eastern Europe, Spain and Mexico, and was assistant to the director Jean Renoir on a number of films. Cartier-Bresson was imprisoned by the Germans in 1940, but escaped three years later and witnessed the liberation of Paris. </p> <p>Cartier-Bresson would never nominate a favourite photograph of his own. But in a 2003 exhibition of his favourite works by others, pride of place went to a 1931 snap by the Hungarian Martin Munkacsi, portraying African boys playing in Lake Tanganyika. </p> <p>\"When I saw that photograph of Munkacsi, of the black kids running in a wave, I couldn't believe such a thing could be caught with the camera,\" he said. \"I said damn it, I took my camera, and I went out into the street.\"</p>",
  "Repeated abuses allegedly suffered by three British prisoners at the hands of US interrogators and guards in the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention camp in Cuba could amount to war crimes, the Red Cross said yesterday. <p>The organisation, which maintains a rigidly neutral stance in public, took the unusual step of voicing its concerns in uncompromising language after the former detainees, known as the Tipton Three, revealed that they had been beaten, shackled, photographed naked and in one incident questioned at gunpoint while in US custody. </p> <p>Their vivid account of the harrowing conditions at the camp, as told to their lawyers and published for the first time in yesterday's Guardian, has reignited the debate about the treatment of prisoners and the British government's role in their questioning and detention. </p> <p>Last night the Red Cross was joined by the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, which argued that if the allegations were true they indicated systematic abuse, amounting to torture. </p> <p>Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats' deputy leader, called for the Foreign Office to mount a \"searching investigation\" into what British officials had seen or been told when they visited Guant\u00e1namo Bay. </p> <p>The Tipton Three were captured in Afghanistan and held at the US military base in Cuba for two years, before being released in March without charge. </p> <p>One man, Rhuhel Ahmed, alleged that an SAS soldier had interrogated him for three hours in Afghanistan while an American colleague held a gun to his head and threatened to shoot him. The trio also said that they had repeatedly complained of abuse to British consular officials. </p> <p>\"Some of the abuses alleged by the detainees would indeed constitute inhuman treatment,\" said Florian Westphal, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. </p> <p>\"But we can't comment on this publicly since this type of allegation is raised directly in discussion with the detaining authority. </p> <p>\"Inhuman treatment constitutes a grave breach of the third Geneva convention and these are often also described as war crimes.\" </p> <p>The organisation is allowed to visit the detainees to ensure they are treated in accordance with the Geneva conventions as long as it does not disclose information about conditions there. It can breach confidentiality in limited circumstances, most importantly, if going public would be in the best interests of the prisoners. </p> <p>Sherman Carroll, spokesman for the Medical Foundation, said the report rang true in light of revelations about techniques of interrogation and torture elsewhere. </p> <p>He added: \"If [the detainees] had used the word torture, I would agree with that. This is more than 'torture-lite' [stress and duress techniques] ... Guant\u00e1namo Bay should be closed down.\" </p> <p>But Major Michael Shavers, the Pentagon spokesman on Guant\u00e1namo Bay, said the US operated \"a safe, humane and professional detention operation\". </p> <p>He added: \"All detainees are treated humanely, appropriately and in accordance with the principles of the third Geneva convention. </p> <p>\"We have investigated all the allegations of abuse at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and have dealt with them. They have been resolved.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Foreign Office said the government had always prioritised the welfare of British detainees and had given them the opportunity to express concerns about their treatment. </p> <p>He added: \"During these welfare visits, neither Mr Ahmed, Mr Iqbal nor Mr Rasul has ever alleged to us that they were systematically abused. </p> <p>\"And although, since returning to the UK, none of the three men has raised allegations of mistreatment with the British government, we have nevertheless taken up their concerns with the American authorities. At our request, the United States is examining the allegations in detail and intends to respond to them fully.\"</p>",
  "<p>A \u00a32bn scheme to save the Thames from returning to the \"Great Stink\" of 1858 which killed all fish in the river has been shelved by the government. </p> <p>With a general election looming ministers have decided it is too big an electoral liability to ask London voters to pay up to \u00a340 extra each household a year to fund the 22-mile tunnel under the riverbed needed to carry storm water and raw sewage to treatment works. </p> <p>The move comes despite warnings to ministers that they are breaking European law by allowing raw sewage to flow into the Thames. </p> <p>Though Thames Water has claimed that 30 years of hard work has transformed the waterway into the cleanest metropolitan river in Europe, boasting 121 species of fish, the company is now discharging raw sewage into the Thames 60 times a year because the Victorian sewerage system cannot cope. </p> <p>This includes 10,000 tonnes of solid sewage flushed in from pipes, including sanitary pads, condoms, hypodermic needles and dead rats, all of which float up and down the river with the tide. </p> <p>The Environment Agency and Thames Water were yesterday forced to clean up a massive fish kill after Tuesday's storms and floods allowed raw sewage into the river. </p> <p>The agency said the health of recreational users of the Thames could also be at risk. </p> <p>Environmentalists claim the situation raises the spectre of the 19th-century cholera epidemics, which killed up to 20,000 people a year. </p> <p>The Great Stink was also caused by raw sewage flowing into the Thames. At times it was so concentrated that Commons' sittings were suspended because the river was \"absolutely pestilential\". </p> <p>The plan to shelve the Thames Tideway project comes as Ofwat, the water price regulator, announced improvements to water ser vices across England for the next five years. </p> <p>In the capital priority has been given to replacing Victorian water mains which in parts of central London are leaking so badly less than 50% of the water pumped into them reaches the taps. </p> <p>The Thames Tideway tunnel was to be burrowed 100 metres under the existing riverbed to avoid tube lines and cables, and take the storm water away from London to sewage works down river. </p> <p>The scheme was drawn up by the water company, the Environment Agency, the Great London Authority and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Plans were to acquire further land and conduct detailed analysis over the next five years so that work could start in 2010, when Londoners would be asked to start paying through their water bills. </p> <p>Information passed to the Guardian shows the government has decided that announcing the cost of the scheme could be too damaging so near a general election. Officials have written to Thames Water saying further work is needed before the scheme can be sanctioned - even though all preliminary work has been done and some of the land purchased. </p> <p>The decision is despite legal advice which states: \"London's sewage does not comply under the Urban Waste Water Directive. Mogden, Beckton and Crossness works [London's main treatment works] are without sufficient capacity and are also non-compliant.\" </p> <p>The note also says that without the scheme there will be \"many objectional examples of gross sewage\" and \"many episodes of low oxygen reducing the health of fish\" and \"threatening the health of the recreational river users\". </p> <p>An environment agency spokeswoman said: \"The Big Stink caused parliament to endorse Bazalgette's solution to a Victorian problem. We do not want a return to those days, we need a 21st-century solution for 21st-century Londoners, not a health hazard, particularly when the river is such a focus for future development and tourism.\" </p> <p>Tony Juniper, the director of Friends of the Earth, said: \"We do not want to return to the Victorian era where the Thames was used as the capital's toilet with all the health implications. The river was an emblem for the nation's clean up. We must not lose that.\" </p> <p>Thames Water conceded that storm overflows were a problem, but with the government seeking to increase the population of London by 800,000 by 2016, sorting out 1,000 miles of Victorian water mains was the priority. The three main sewage works also needed updating, it said. </p> <p><strong>A Stygian pool: The Thames, 1858</strong></p> <p>In June 1858 the smell from the River Thames was so bad journalists described it as \"the Great Stink\". Sheets soaked with chloride of lime were hung at the windows of the House of Commons to prevent MPs getting cholera. </p> <p>Benjamin Disraeli described the river as \"a Stygian pool reeking with ineffable and unbearable horror\". Sittings were suspended and there was talk of moving the law courts to Oxford. </p> <p>The Great Stink was preceded by serious cholera epidemics. London saw 18,000 deaths in 1849 and a further 20,000 in 1854. Water was drawn direct from the river for drinking - even though all fish had long since died. </p> <p>Sir Joseph Bazalgette, the brilliant engineer who designed the sewers to solve the problem, described how the Great Stink occurred. </p> <p>\"The whole of the sewage passed down sewers ... into the low grounds adjoining the Thames ... forming great elongated cesspools of stagnant sewage, and then when the tide went down and opened the outlets, that sewage was poured into the river ... Furthermore, this sewage kept oscillating up and down the river, while more filth was continually adding to it, until the Thames became absolutely pestilential.\" </p> <p>Sir Joseph's sewers still serve London today.</p>",
  "The charities bill represents the chance for a shake-up of 400-year-old charity law. Charities play a vital role in society and charity law reform is essential for the enhancement of public trust in charities. But it is also important that we get the bill right (Private schools bill shambles, August 3). <p>The joint committee scrutinising the bill is therefore to be commended for identifying possible problems with the draft legislation. However, we believe that this issue can be resolved. As your article suggests, one solution would be for the Charity Commission to develop guidance on how it will apply the public benefit test, as defined in common law. This guidance should be developed in consultation with charities. It is important to remember that this bill is about much more than public schools.<br><b>Stuart Etherington</b><br>Chief executive, National Council for Voluntary Organisations</p> <p>If public benefit is to be interpreted entirely as financial benefit, as your leader (August 4) implies, the financial benefit from our 1,061 charitable independent schools is overwhelmingly in favour of the taxpayer. The 450,000 children they educate would otherwise cost the state some \u00a32bn a year - many times your own figure (\u00a3100m) for the fiscal benefits of charitable status. In addition, our schools spend some \u00a3230m a year in giving help with fees. </p> <p>But public benefit is more than financial. It includes widening access to ensure that the benefits of independent schools are available to children whose parents cannot afford full fees, and available to the local community. More than 30% of the children in our schools are given help with fees, most of them by the schools themselves.</p> <p>Charitable status gives a social purpose, over and above educating children. It brings into the teaching profession many people who would otherwise work elsewhere. With 17% of A-level students now at independent schools, and with nearly a quarter of all maths and science A-level candidates in the independent sector, we represent an important part total educational provision.<br><b>Jonathan Shephard</b><br>General secretary, Independent Schools Council</p> <p>The vast majority of the public have no idea that centres of privilege such as Eton receive the same tax breaks as charities such as ActionAid. But it is not just fee-paying schools that will lobby furiously against a stricter public benefit test. </p> <p>Religious charities could find themselves under closer scrutiny. Why should Christianity, Islam and Judaism charitable but not other kinds of alternative guru or spiritual/ lifestyle organisations? </p> <p>As a charity lawyer, I often find filing applications with the Charity Commission leads into an Alice-in-Wonderland world. Discussions of public benefit are undertaken in accordance with supposedly objective tests - yet we all know that what is charitable is ideological and political. </p> <p>It will be a shame if the debate on public benefit wrecks the bill's passage, as there are a number of excellent measures, such as the introduction of an independent charity appeal tribunal that can challenge the decisions of the Charity Commission. However, I welcome the opportunity for the public truly understand where their tax breaks are going.<br><b>Rosamund McCarthy</b><br>Bates, Wells &amp; Braithwaite Solicitors</p> <p>So the bill puts \"a new duty on charities to be generous with their experience, expertise and so on in order to participate in the charity brand\".

  "<p>Sven-Goran Eriksson's fate is unlikely to be sealed today despite an emergency board meeting this afternoon at an undisclosed central London location.</p> <p>The 12-man FA board will hear the findings of an inquiry into the circumstances that led to an erroneous denial of Eriksson's affair with Faria Alam being issued. But despite the desperate need to draw a line under this debilitating and embarrassing issue the bloodletting at Soho Square is unlikely to end.</p> <p>Last night the FA announced that regardless of the findings the board could ask for further evidence from any of the parties involved, a sign that the confusion at Soho Square is set to rumble on. </p> <p>In a statement the FA also said it had retained a second set of lawyers - Mayer, Brown, Rowe &amp; Maw LLP - to advise it on \"matters arising\" from the report, a further indication that the inquiry is unlikely to provide the tidy conclusion to the affair the FA so desperately needs.</p> <p>After a fortnight in which too much has been said with too little thought, the board and the management team attempting to steer the FA to calmer waters are clearly determined to go by the book.</p> <p>\"It is the board's role to concentrate on the facts and ensure all of the correct processes and procedures are followed. This is clearly a detailed issue,\" the FA said. </p> <p>\"All decisions must follow standard procedures and employment law . . . The board may determine it appropriate to seek more evidence or refer the matter for further consideration. It is imperative at this time that rigorous processes are followed.\"</p> <p>Such is the media interest in the story - Soho Square was again besieged yesterday - that the board members will not be informed of the meeting's location until midmorning. </p> <p>This could lead to some fairly frantic taxi journeys. Two members, David Sheepshanks and Peter Heard, are due to attend a Football League board meeting in the morning, and Bolton's chairman Phil Gartside has only just returned from China. </p> <p>The inquiry report, compiled by Peter Norbury of Eversheds, a Manchester-based firm, will reveal the evidence gathered from the key players. At the heart of the matter is the question whether the notorious conversation between David Davies and Eriksson was sufficiently unequivocal for the FA to be justified in issuing a denial. </p> <p>The testimony of both men is likely to be measured against the terms of Eriksson's contract, which includes clauses relating to his behaviour and what constitutes misconduct, and the board is likely to seek legal advice on whether they have a case against Eriksson. </p> <p>A majority of the board would vote for the coach to be dismissed if they felt he could be disposed of cheaply.</p> <p>Any move to dismiss would trigger a lengthy and potentially costly process, beginning with the board bringing disciplinary action against Eriksson or Alam. Such proceedings would require a motion to be proposed and seconded prior to a vote. If the vote were to end 6-6, Geoff Thompson would not have the casting vote, but merely offer a view before a second vote.</p> <p>For the chairman, still apparently steering today's agenda, the afternoon promises to be uncomfortable. He cleared Mark Palios of wrongdoing last week only to accept the chief executive's resignation on Sunday, a startling piece of mismanagement that infuriated many board members.</p> <p>Thompson could not be dismissed tomorrow, but he may find himself the subject of a vote of no confidence. Any motion to remove him would need to be ratified at the next meeting of the FA council in October.</p> <p>The prospect of a protracted wrangle over the leadership of the FA may be too much for some to stomach, however, and despite being deeply compromised Thompson could survive in the short term.</p> <p>A leadership team comprising the executive director David Davies, the director of football Sir Trevor Brooking, the commercial director Jonathan Hill and the head of media Adrian Bevington has adopted temporary control, and their roles may be formalised today.</p>",

  "<p>Yukos, the embattled Russian oil group struggling to pay a crippling $3.4bn (\u00a31.9bn) tax bill, last night secured a double lifeline in moves that could help ease the global crisis over oil prices. </p> <p>The Russian justice ministry released frozen accounts to enable Yukos to allow its daily operations to continue after the oil group had warned it would have to cease production as early as next week. </p> <p>The group, which has only until the end of this month to pay its tax debts, also won backing from BP to raise up to $360m through the sale of its 56% stake in Siberian gas firm Rospan to its joint venture partner, TNK-BP, in a deal that could be signed within weeks. </p> <p>TNK-BP, which operates Rospan and has a 44% stake, confirmed that talks with Yukos to buy out its stake had begun - subject to shareholder approval and permission from the Russian authorities. But Yukos said negotiations were being blocked by the same justice ministry that unfroze some of its accounts. </p> <p>Bruce Misamore, Yukos's chief executive, said: \"We welcome the justice ministry's decision [to release accounts] which lets us continue financing our ongoing business.\" </p> <p>But according to the Interfax news agency, Yukos lawyer Dmitry Gololobov said that the ministry had so far not answered a letter asking for permission to sell its stake in Rospan. The company, which produces 3.6bn cubic metres of gas a year, is held by an offshore subsidiary of Yukos named Hedgerow and, TNK-BP said, any transactions it made were not in breach of Russian law and were unaffected by the freeze on the Yukos assets. </p> <p>It is the first effort by the Russian group to sell assets to pay off its tax debts, but a company spokesman warned that Yukos would still be hard-pressed to meet its payment deadline. Of its $1.7bn monthly income, he said, $1.5bn is required for expenses, including taxes and transport. That would leave just $200m for payment of back tax, and the company has said it can raise only $1.8bn by August 31. </p> <p>Yukos would get $357m from the sale of its stake in Rospan, which has reserves of 950bn cubic metres of gas plus another 100m tonnes of gas condensate; it is based in Urengoy, eastern Siberia. </p> <p>Through a subsidiary, Rizben Enterprises, TNK-BP can unilaterally decide to buy shares from Hedgerow upon written notification. </p> <p>Apart from yesterday's developments and a rare piece of good news this week, when a court ruled in Yukos's favour against the collection of a $230m bailiff fee, the oil company's fortunes have continued to deteriorate. </p> <p>Along with the $3.4bn tax debt from 2000 it is facing another bill for $3.3bn from 2001, and government officials have warned they are likely to collect back taxes from subsequent years as well. </p> <p>The federal arbitration court yesterday rejected Yukos's attempt to stop the seizure of the $3.4bn in tax debt. Court bailiffs have said they will seize and sell Yukos's core operation, Yuganskneftegaz, if the tax debt is not paid in full by the end of August. </p> <p>Another appeal is scheduled to be heard on September 6 - after the collection deadline has passed. </p> <p>Yukos's former chief executive and controlling shareholder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and fellow shareholder, Platon Lebedev, are on trial in Moscow on charges of fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion.</p>",
  "Street-to-street fighting between Iraqi police and heavily armed insurgents left 12 Iraqis dead and wounded 26 others in the northern city of Mosul yesterday. <p>Witnesses said terrified residents had fled for cover as police traded fire with dozens of masked men armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, who had attacked police positions and tried to raid a bank in the south-west of the city. </p> <p>A spokesman for the interior ministry in Baghdad said police had shot dead eight of the armed men and arrested 22 others in a series of running gun battles. Four civilians were reported to have been killed in the crossfire. </p> <p>Two Iraqi police officers were slightly wounded in the fighting, which did not involve US troops, the spokesman said. Local authorities imposed a curfew. </p> <p>Mosul, a former stronghold of the Ba'ath party, has seen a rise in bombings, assassinations, and attacks on US forces in recent weeks. </p> <p>US army officials said the violence was part of a series of attacks in the city, including a grenade attack that hit a home, a shooting at a police station, and a roadside bomb attack on a US convoy. </p> <p>The ministry spokesman said the attacks had been the work of people from outside Mosul who were trying to \"spark looting in the city to make some profit\". </p> <p>Falah Naquib, the interior minister, said the battle was a sign of the progress the interim government was making in \"countering the lawlessness\" that has racked large parts of the country since the US-led invasion. </p> <p>\"Before sovereignty, the Iraqi police would have just run away, yesterday they stood up to and beat the thieves and gangsters [who] shelter under the false banners of resistance,\" Mr Naquib said. </p> <p>\"Despite the violence, we are struggling to cope with the numbers of people applying to join the police.\" </p> <p>There was some good news for Iraq's interim government yesterday with reports that a tribal chief in the turbulent city of Falluja had led a raid to free four Jordanian drivers. </p> <p>A group calling itself the Death Squad of Iraqi Resistance said last Thursday it was holding the Jordanians to put pressure on their transport company to stop cooperation with US forces in Iraq. </p> <p>The raid to free the hostages was led by Sheikh Haj Ibrahim Jassam, who surrounded a house in Falluja with about 100 armed members of his clan. The five kidnappers inside fled. </p> <p>\"I called upon my brothers and tribesmen to free the hostages, so we raided the house last night,\" Sheikh Jassam told the Associated Press. \"I'm glad that those innocent Muslims were freed.\" </p> <p>A militant group reportedly run by the Jordanian-born militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi released two Turkish workers after Turkish truck drivers agreed to halt deliveries to US forces in Iraq. </p> <p>The hostage-taking and threats have dissuaded some companies from coming to Iraq, or have led to companies firms and governments withdrawing personnel. </p> <p>But Mr Naqib said the kidnappings, in which more than 70 foreigners have been held and nine killed, were due to \"75% criminal gangs\" and that it was \"a containable problem\". </p> <p>He pointed to a police raid in Baghdad this week that had freed a Lebanese businessman. </p> <p>\"They [the kidnappers] were nothing more than extortionists,\" he said. </p> <p>\"They got carried away by all the hype the Arab satellite TVs give them.\" </p> <p>A ministry source said police were looking into whether the gang who had kidnapped the Lebanese man was the same one that beheaded the Korean Kim Sun-il in June. </p> <p>Mr Naquib said there were a range of groups at work, some with \"foreign elements\".</p>",
  "The US official leading the search for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction has confirmed that the new head of M16, John Scarlett, sent him suggestions of what to include in his final report. <p>Charles Duelfer, the head of the Iraq survey group (ISG), described Mr Scarlett's email as a reminder of investigations carried out by the group before Mr Duelfer took over its leadership in January. He said he did not view the note as inappropriate, but had decided not to include any of its contents. </p> <p>\"What they [the British] provided was not new information but elements of a previous report, which I decided were not relevant,\" Mr Duelfer said. </p> <p>He said he rejected allegations that \"the Brits were trying to foist some views on me\". </p> <p>\"Whoever has something relevant to say, I'm ready to listen to ... I meet with people all the time. But if someone tries to steer me in one direction I tend to go the opposite direction.\" </p> <p>Mr Duelfer said he would deliver a comprehensive report on the search for weapons of mass destruction by the end of September. </p> <p>That report will take on an enormous significance, just over a month before the presidential elections. The ISG has found no sign of weapons used by the US and Britain to justify the invasion. But in testimony to Congress five months ago, Mr Duelfer said Saddam Hussein could have been developing a capacity to produce WMD at short notice. </p> <p>The Mail on Sunday this week claimed that Mr Scarlett had tried to \"insert untruths\" into the final ISG report in an email to Mr Duelfer on March 8, suggesting he include \"golden nuggets\" such as the claim that Iraq had or was developing smallpox weapons and that the regime had mobile biological weapons laboratories and was working on a high-velocity rail gun for use in nuclear weapons research. </p> <p>No evidence of any of those programmes has been found, nor of Iraqi WMD stockpiles of any description. </p> <p>In a telephone interview from Baghdad on Tuesday night Mr Duelfer said: \"These so-called nuggets that the British had brought to my attention for my consideration were lifted out of previous ISG work ... Whatever the British offered up it didn't fit into what I was trying to do.\" </p> <p>Mr Duelfer, a former state department official who led the UN weapons inspection commission from 1998 to 2000, denied that he had shortened the ISG report under US and British government pressure. He said his report would be \"a big production\", but warned it would \"no doubt leave some unanswered questions\". </p> <p>\"We continue to receive reports all the time and we continue to check if there is anything in them,\" he said. </p> <p>He has been accused of omitting more than 200 pages of inspectors' reports when he delivered a progress report to Congress in March. That evidence, his critics claim, would have confirmed the findings of his predecessor, David Kay, that there were no weapons stockpiles and US and British officials had been \"almost all wrong\" about WMD. </p> <p>Mr Duelfer said he only delivered a short status report in March because he felt that as a newcomer he could not defend unfamiliar research. </p> <p>\"In March I inherited the obligation to provide a report to Congress and I had been in the job for about five weeks,\" he said. \"I felt uncomfortable that I could confidently defend a couple of hundred pages in what is always a very lively forum in Congress.\" </p> <p>\"A second reason was that I did not want to make incremental assessments on selected parts of the Iraq WMD programme. I wanted to present an assessment of it in a comprehensive way.\"</p>",
  "<p>Kevin Maxwell, son of the late, disgraced media baron Robert Maxwell, appeared to win some breathing space yesterday in his battle to stave off financial crisis. </p> <p>The companies court in London was told that a long overdue \u00a318,000 payment had been made to a creditor seeking a winding-up order against Mr Maxwell's main business, Meynard Freres, a property and financing firm. </p> <p>The winding-up petition had been sought after two cheques for \u00a318,000 had bounced. The payments related to the acquisition of some assets of struggling Midlands firm Astec Engineering Services. </p> <p>Mr Maxwell became Britain's biggest bankrupt in 1992, with debts of \u00a3400m in the wake of the Mirror Group pension scandal that engulfed his family. </p> <p>By 1995, however, his bankruptcy had been discharged and a year later he was acquitted on criminal charges relating to allegations that he had helped his father steal more than \u00a3120m from the Mirror pension fund. </p> <p>Yesterday there remained some confusion over the position of outstanding debts of more than \u00a3300,000 which Meynard Freres owed to a second creditor, Global Investment. Global had sought a winding-up order earlier this year but the application was later dismissed. </p> <p>It is understood that the creditor has issued another petition at Oxford county court which has yet to be resolved. </p> <p>A spokesman for Beachcroft Wansbrough, the law firm acting for Global, said yesterday: \"As far as I know that position has not changed.\" He refused to comment further. </p> <p>In the meantime, Mr Maxwell will receive a small cash injection after agreeing to hire out his \u00a33m home, Moulsford Manor, overlooking the Thames near Henley, to a television production team shooting the Midsomer Murders drama series.</p>",
  "<p>Forget the start of the grouse shooting season, wrote Robert Cole in the <strong>Times</strong>. \"Well before Thursday week, the Glorious Twelfth, open season may be declared on Abbey National, the mortgage bank.\" </p> <p>Following last week's announcement of an offer for Abbey from Banco Santander Hispano Centrale, HBOS - the business formed from the merger of Halifax and the Bank of Scotland - let it be known that it, too, fancied buying Abbey, despite denying any interest last week. That Santander had a competitor came as little surprise, as Alex Brummer said in the <strong>Daily Mail</strong>: \"The Abbey share price, at above the Santander offer, is inviting in another buyer.\" </p> <p>There were shades, for the <strong>Scotsman's</strong> Martin Flanagan (and for plenty of other commentators), of the way the Safeway auction unfolded last year. \"Just as with Safeway _ there looks a pretty safe bid on the table as far as regulatory hurdles go (for William Morrison substitute Santander). A pretender has now moved on to the stage in the shape of HBOS ... Think retailing maverick Philip Green swiftly moving to confirm his competing interest in Safeway.\" And just as the big four supermarkets then began to ponder bidding for Safeway, said Flanagan, so might one or more of the big four banks take a look at Abbey. </p> <p>The Lex column of the <strong>Financial Times</strong> hoped the big boys would stay out. Unlike them, HBOS \"can deliver an acquisition benefiting customers as well as shareholders\". But, warned the <strong>Wall Street Journal Europe's</strong> Breaking Views column, \"a bid from HBOS for Abbey National is more likely to be blocked by regulators than the existing bid from Santander,\" because Abbey and Halifax between them dominate the mortgage market. </p> <p>\"It's hard to see the Competition Commission allowing one bank to command 34% of this vast, important market,\" agreed Neil Collins, the City editor of the <strong> Daily Telegraph</strong>. Lex countered that the benefits to customers might help the HBOS bid clear the regulator, but accepted that was a slim hope. </p> <p>However, reckoned Brummer, a competition inquiry \"might clarify the rules of engagement in British financial services. There must be some sympathy for the view that it makes no sense to allow UK banks to fall into overseas hands because they are blocked from amalgamating any further. But the banks could do themselves a big favour by competing more strongly on customer services.\" </p> <p>When James Crosby, the chief executive of HBOS, made his bank's interest known, said Michael Harrison in the <strong>Independent</strong>, he was \"undoubtedly seeking to test the political and regulatory waters\". Not that it would do him any good. \"Given that the only surefire winners in a bidding war for Abbey involving a rival UK bank would be the lawyers and investment bank advisers, Mr Crosby might be best advised not to take the plunge,\" said Harrison. </p> <p>Maybe there was an ulterior motive to the bid, suggested Alf Young in the Glasgow <strong> Herald</strong>: revenge. In November 2000, before its merger with Halifax, Bank of Scotland had tried to buy Abbey in a bid that was eventually rebuffed. \"The men on the Mound were taken completely by surprise. Despite falling into Halifax's embrace on that particular rebound, they have not forgotten - or forgiven - the sheer indignity of it all.\" </p> <p>Young was also unimpressed by the logic behind the bid. \"Why is pushing his group's overall mortgage exposure, at a stroke, from 23% of the UK market to 35% such a good idea this week, when squeezing HBOS's net share of new mortgage lending down to 17% between January and June was such a sterling achievement last week, when the HBOS interims were announced?\" he wondered. </p> <p>To which suitor would Abbey turn, then? The Times's Cole warned that Santander's bid - regarded by City analysts as tight-fisted - might evaporate if regulatory scrutiny of counter-offers delayed the process. \"Rather than take the measly-looking bird in the hand,\" Cole suggested, \"Abbey should look for other, plumper birds lurking in the bush.\"</p>",
  "\"I think they intend to go to Chicago or some place and fly into a building - Don't worry, Dad - If it happens, it'll be very fast - My God, my God.\" Peter Hanson, a passenger on United Airlines Flight 175, is talking to his father, Lee Hanson, at 9am on Tuesday September 11 2001. He thinks that he's about to die. A son's instinctive compassion leads him to look beyond the grave and help a father's grieving: \"Don't worry, Dad - If it happens, it'll be very fast.\" Three minutes later, his plane strikes the World Trade Centre in New York and Peter Hanson is dead. <p>This phone transcript from the recently published 9/11 commission report reminds us why the United States is a country that still considers itself to be at war. As I write, Washington has just joined New York on the second highest level of alert against terrorist attack. President Bush has announced the creation of a new national intelligence director and counterterrorism centre, swiftly implementing key recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 commission. According to a recent poll, the military is by far the most trusted institution in the United States. Four out of five Americans say they have confidence in the military, compared to just one in five who trust Congress. In the presidential election, warlike images prevail. It's as if Bush and Kerry are standing mainly for the office of commander in chief. </p> <p>John Kerry started his acceptance speech at last week's Democratic convention by giving a military salute and saying, \"I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty.\" He was introduced, very movingly, by a veteran who lost both legs and one arm fighting in Vietnam. On stage were other Vietnam veterans who served with Kerry on one of the so-called swift boats going up the Mekong river. That swift boat provided the metaphor for Kerry's whole speech. Evoking \"our band of brothers\" he said: \"We may be a little older, we may be a little greyer, but we still know how to fight for our country.\" Pointing to a giant stars and stripes flag, he recalled how \"Old Glory\" used to fly \"from the gun turret right behind my head and it was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind.\" And he came back to the gunboat at the end, claiming that the men who served on it cared nothing for their differences of race and background. \"That is the kind of America that I will lead as president: an America where we are all in the same boat.\"</p> <p>This unabashed, emotional, militant patriotism is something unimaginable in contemporary Europe. Watching many hours of it, glued to the television screen here in California, I felt conflicting emotions: some envy of a nation that still has the confidence and optimism to evoke those simple, primary colours, \"freedom and faith and family\" as Bill Clinton put it, in a brilliant speech; some alarm at the way in which my own emotions could be manipulated, for this Democratic convention was directed like a Hollywood movie. (Steven Spielberg helped with the documentary film introducing Kerry.) Then a fit of old European irony at the patriotic kitsch. John Kerry served bravely in Vietnam, but only for four and a half months. We shall be hearing about his service for a lot longer. </p> <p>I was reminded of an old Czech joke about the much mythologised Slovak national rising against the Nazis: \"Which lasted longer, the Slovak rising or the film about the Slovak rising?\" And yet, through it all, I had an overwhelming sense that here, amid these enthusiastic men and women of every colour and background, was the other, better America, which has got lost from European view amid the Cheneys, Rumsfelds and Bushes. </p> <p>Of course we all understand what is behind this war show. Here are the Democrats defiantly occupying the high ground of patriotism and national security on which the Bush White House has chosen to fight this election. Swing voters should trust the seasoned Vietnam veteran Kerry to win the war on terrorism rather than the Vietnam draft-avoider Bush. Kerry's critique of the way the Iraq war has been prosecuted, alienating America's friends around the world and without any proper plan for winning the peace, is compelling. In fact, almost every point that critical Europeans have made against the Bush administration was made by Democrats at the convention. They spoke passionately about the environment. They pilloried America's dependence on \"foreign oil\". They talked again and again about how America cannot win this war on its own. </p> <p>Will this campaign strategy work? Although people say Kerry is a strong finisher, I have a nagging feeling that he may still prove too remote and wooden for the undecided swing voters, when contrasted with the folksy Bush. (A reporter who has followed Kerry as a senator in Boston pays him a deadly compliment. John Kerry, he says, is perfectly qualified to be the president - of France.) So much will depend on what happens in the last weeks of the campaign; in America, and in Iraq. If it were possible for this to happen without more American soldiers coming home in bodybags, and tens of ordinary Iraqis dying for every one American, I would express the Machiavellian hope that things should get visibly worse in Iraq until election day, then dramatically better from November 3 on. </p> <p>If Kerry does scrape home, Europe will find a president who leads a more congenial America in almost every respect. But we won't be back to business as usual before September 11 2001. The key difference is now clear. All American leaders think we are at war; most European leaders think we are still at peace. </p> <p>The Bush administration started out believing that the United States could, if need be, win this war on its own. A Kerry administration would start from the position that this war can only be won by working with America's friends and allies around the world. It will therefore ask us to step straight up to the plate. Kerry's carefully unspecific recipe for the future of Iraq is that bringing more allies on board should help to reduce the American troop presence there. </p> <p>If Europe has any wisdom at all, we should start thinking now about how we answer this Democratic challenge. Our answer should be, \"Yes, so long as _ \" Yes, so long as you rededicate yourself to a peace process between Israel and Palestine. So long as you recognise that Iraq has to be embedded into a much larger project of reform and development in the broader Middle East, which America and Europe can only achieve together. So long as you deliver on your promises to develop alternative energy technologies, address your own excessive carbon dioxide emissions, come back to the international treaties and institutions that the Bush administration abrogated and scorned. </p> <p>We're all in the same boat, too, and we want to be. However, before skipper Kerry pulls the throttle, we have to agree not just the rules of engagement but who exactly the enemy is and what creek we're up. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Timothy Garton Ash's new book, Free World: Why a Crisis of the West Reveals the Opportunity of Our Time, was recently published by Penguin </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.freeworldweb.net\">www.freeworldweb.net</a></p>",
  "Most of the delegates who set the rules for diplomatic immunity in Vienna in 1961 would have grown up in the early years of the 20th century, when diplomacy consisted largely of wealthy, clubbable gentlemen with a classical education and catholic interests, parading in ostrich-feather hats in public and, in private, cutting cynical secret deals over brandy and cigars. <p>The treaty their 1961 successors came up with, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, was signed against the background of a cardinally different era. It wasn't so much that the cold war was in full swing, although it was. It was that the old world order, with Europe on top, had collapsed. The old European empires, the British, the French, the Dutch, the Belgian and the Portuguese, were disintegrating at speed, and old colonies were becoming new countries. Independent republics and kingdoms, borders and capitals, had been proliferating on the map since the end of the war, with names, such as Vietnam, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, that still sounded unfamiliar to Europeans. </p> <p>Anger in Britain in recent days at the possibility that diplomatic immunity might allow a London-based Saudi diplomat to escape investigation for alleged indecent assault has focused attention on the 1961 convention's immunity clauses. Yet one of the reasons the delegates drafting the convention did not think through the dangers of potential diplomat criminals escaping justice was that they had other concerns on their minds. Many of the European delegates, historians of diplomacy say, were more concerned to define exactly what a diplomat was. They were tormented by primitive fears that their Georgian terraces and fine arrondissements would be overrun by embassies of thousands of ex-colonial \"diplomats\" from Africa and Asia. Their developing world counterparts, on the other hand, were determined to avoid snubs and paternalism from their old colonial masters. </p> <p>Amid this tension, it is not surprising that the subtler consequences of the document - the possibility that rogue diplomats from any country, rich or poor, might be able to evade responsibility for awful crimes - were unforeseen. It is striking that the convention does, in fact, have one big exemption for diplomatic immunity: you can still sue a diplomat in the civil courts, it seems, for \"a real action against private immoveable property\". In other words, if a drunken ambassador kicks your front door and makes a mark, you can sue him, but if he molests small children, you can't. </p> <p>No wonder the question is being raised as to whether, more than 40 years on, and in a world that has again changed utterly, it is not time to revisit the concept of diplomatic immunity. Some go further: they wonder whether the very idea of diplomats and embassies, in their traditional sense, have a place in the 21st century. </p> <p>\"Diplomats are not as important as they once were, or, indeed, as some still think they are,\" says Geoffrey Robertson, a leading human rights lawyer. \"In this age of jet travel and email and videoconferencing, the role of the ambassador as representing his head of state no longer has the same significance. And that immunity from prosecution for serious crime is wrong in principle.\" </p> <p>This linkage of diplomatic immunity with the notion of diplomatic redundancy infuriates specialists like the distinguished historian of diplomacy Professor Geoff Berridge of Leicester University. \"It's absolutely ridiculous,\" he says. \"This idea surfaces periodically. It has done since the early 1970s, this idea that diplomats have been made irrelevant by the jet age and the telephone and so on. </p> <p>\"Have you heard of a multinational corporation that doesn't want its people on the ground, snooping, pressing the flesh, engaging in what we would call public diplomacy? The only reason ministries of foreign affairs get flak for this is that they are so visibly dealing with foreigners all the time. Their constituency is foreigners, so they're always going to get it in the neck.\" </p> <p>Indeed, the Foreign Office (FO) in London is one of the staunchest defenders of the traditional concept of diplomatic immunity. There can be no immunity for our diplomats anywhere, they say, without reciprocal immunity for foreign diplomats here. </p> <p>\"Diplomatic privileges and immunities allow ambassadors and their staff to act independently of any local pressures, to represent their countries under protection from attack and harrassment, and communicate freely with their own governments,\" says an FO official. \"But the convention makes clear the purpose is not to protect the individual.\" </p> <p>Under the 1961 convention, accredited diplomats are exempt from almost all forms of taxation in their host countries, and cannot be prosecuted for any crime unless their own government and the host government agree to waive immunity. </p> <p>The current Saudi case involves a 41-year-old diplomat, as yet unnamed, who was arrested by police on the morning of July 26 after he was accused of indecently assaulting an 11-year-old girl in west London. Because of his status, neither the police nor the Crown Prosecution Service can take the case further until the British and Saudi governments agree what should be done. </p> <p>The FO says it sent a letter to the Saudis last week, asking for the diplomat's immunity to be waived, but it has yet to get a reply and is \"pressing them for a decision\". All the government would be able to do if the Saudis refused a waiver would be to request that the Saudis sent the man home; if that failed, the last resort would be to declare him persona non grata and expel him. </p> <p>Waivers are not unprecedented. If the country where the crime is committed is particularly large and powerful, and the diplomat's country particularly small and weak, the diplomat's chances of escaping justice are less. Seven years ago a Georgian diplomat, Gueorgui Makharadze, was sentenced to between seven and 21 years in prison in the US for causing the death of a Maryland teenager while driving drunk. </p> <p>When the disproportion in size and power is in the other direction, waivers are less likely. In 1987, the US refused to waive the diplomatic immunity of the husband of one of its diplomats in London after he was accused of indecent exposure. The charge could have carried a sentence of up to two years; instead, the US embassy chose to send him home \"for treatment\". </p> <p>The most notorious example of alleged criminals being allowed to return to their home countries without investigation or prosecution came in 1984, with the murder of the policewoman Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London. The burden of evidence pointed to the embassy as the origin of the gunshots which killed her, from a weapon smuggled in a \"diplomatic bag\" - under the convention, diplomats' luggage is not subject to search. </p> <p>\"We can never again allow the spectacle of what happened after Yvonne Fletcher, when the killers were escorted out to the aeroplane with the murder weapon, it is suspected, in their suitcases,\" says Robertson. </p> <p>In the wake of the Fletcher tragedy, the government concluded that while it might be desirable to reform the convention, the time and effort required to get every country in the world to agree would make it next to impossible. </p> <p>Robertson points out that there was no reason why groups of countries could not set the ball rolling by agreeing between themselves to a permanent waiver for their diplomats in each other's countries. \"There's no justification at all for it to continue in relation to the countries of the European Union, most of which have reasonably high standards of justice, for America, or for many nations of the Commonwealth,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Yes, we still need the Vienna convention, because in some countries, the justice system is corrupt or politicised, and there is a danger diplomats could be framed. We need to protect embassies. We don't need to protect diplomatic baggage any longer.\" </p> <p>One way forward, he says, would be to replace diplomatic immunity for the most serious crimes with the option of trying diplomats so accused in one of the new international criminal courts now being set up. </p> <p>The system has been a long time coming, the ancient Greeks drew up basic rules of diplomatic conduct, but for centuries, being a diplomat was an edgy business. </p> <p>In a study of the emergent diplomatic corps in Ottoman Constantinople in the early 17th century, Prof Berridge points out that European diplomats were part negotiators, part emissaries, but to a great extent hostages. Sir Thomas Roe, the English ambassador for most of the 1620s, described a discussion about trade between England and Turkey some way removed from present niceties: \"The vizier took part against us, the veriest villain that ever lived, and used me with great contempt, threatened to hang my secretary,\" he wrote to London. </p> <p>It was no way to treat a gentleman, Sir Thomas felt, and class, privilege and honour were the drivers of much of the early attempts to make rules protecting diplomats. \"You wouldn't have got individuals from the higher social strata to do this kind of work if they could be abused and insulted in foreign countries, if they weren't given a certain degree of special protection,\" says Berridge. </p> <p>The 1961 convention was, in itself, an update of a convention drawn up in 1815, at the end of the Napoleonic wars, by a set of ministers who were also aristocrats, determined to stamp out any further pretensions by commoners or the lower orders to run Europe. </p> <p>A glimpse into the world of diplomatic crimes and misdemeanours in London in 2002, given in a parliamentary answer last year, suggests that the popular image of the country's 20,000-odd foreign diplomats as dedicated to taking advantage is wide of the mark. A little over 3,000 unpaid diplomat parking tickets were recorded, with just three countries - the United Arab Emirates, Libya and China - making up a fifth of the total. But a more worrying figure was the 20 serious crimes - those carrying sentences of 12 months or more - which diplomats had committed. </p> <p>Deep down, the problem of diplomatic immunity may remain as it was: one of elites and honour. That the reason countries' governments may be so reluctant to let their diplomats be punished abroad is that they all come from the same narrow group of top people, all with very great ideas of their own importance. </p> <p>Thomas Otte, another expert on the history of diplomacy, observes: \"Historically speaking, of course, the whole issue of diplomatic immunity arose because, traditionally, diplomats were regarded as honourable spies, honourable men sent abroad to spy and lie for their countries.\"</p>",

Purnomo Yusgiantoro, the Indonesian president of Opec, has warned that the cartel will not be able to increase production to bring down prices, the rise in which has been fuelled by uncertainty over the future of Russian oil giant Yukos and attacks on pipelines in Iraq. Better fill up now before we hit $50 a barrel. </p> <p>The 11 members of Opec - Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela - supply more than 40% of the world's oil and have more than 75% of all proven reserves. They have us over a ... well, they've certainly got us where they want us. Yusgiantoro's statement may even be a bargaining ploy. So the answer, surely, is to start looking beyond Opec. </p> <p>Hampshire may be a good place to start. Last summer, Northern Petroleum struck oil near Winchester, between the A31 and A272, and it thinks the field could be good for 100m barrels. The company is also exploring widely in West Sussex and on the Isle of Wight. That's the spirit. The Campaign to Protect Rural England is objecting to drilling, but let's hope Northern's valiant efforts are not blocked by such stockbroker-belt nimbyism. </p> <p>And what about Rajasthan? Shell had more or less abandoned prospecting there, but oil minnow Cairn Energy made several major finds this year and reckons Rajasthan could be the new Texas; it has already found fields with an estimated 360m barrels of recoverable oil and is now planning exploration in Nepal. Cairn is run by former Scottish rugby international Bill Gammell; playing rugby for Scotland is the perfect pursuit for unquenchable optimists. Cairn invested $7.2m in the search for oil in Rajasthan; the find could be worth $500m. Gammell was recently named Scottish entrepreneur of the year. </p> <p>BP's latest Statistical Review of World Energy pinpoints reserves in improbable places: Denmark has 1.3bn barrels, Peru 1bn, Papua New Guinea 400m. Greece looks promising; Kazakhstan has huge potential (though there are fears that drilling could trigger earthquakes); the North Sea is by no means exhausted, with major new finds still being made; there are hopes that substantial reserves will be found in the Falklands; and \u00a335m is being spent on offshore exploration in North Wales.

Apparently fathers lack imagination, are often at a loss as to how to play games - or are simply too competitive. \"Children will get fed up if they lose all the time,\" said Tim Gill, CPC's director. \"It's frankly demoralising and not much fun.\" </p> <p>Leaving aside questions of what the Children's Play Council is or does, and what Gill's office looks like (I imagine him wading to his desk through a sea of brightly coloured plastic balls), what we seem to have here is yet another pronouncement from the Department of the Bleeding Obvious. Of course fathers are rubbish at playing with their children. Children have suspect bowling actions, are easily fooled at most card games, and the rules of What's the Time, Mr Wolf? are, famously, of Byzantine complexity. </p> <p>The big issue is letting them win. The Competitive Dads who refuse to lower their game to the child's level are, basically, jerks. Those who always let little Timmy win lest his self-esteem takes a knock are, on the other hand, creeps. </p> <p>Personally, I steer a middle course by being genuinely atrocious at almost all sports, and playing left-handed at any for which I possess a shred of talent. The simplest technique involves avoiding playtime altogether, but this can be hard in the summer holidays and lead to rebuke. </p> <p>The trick is to find a game that you both like, and that it is important for youngsters to learn.

Activities inside include connecting the dots to find Arnold groping a woman, colouring in the governor as Conan the Barbarian, and driving a Hummer from Hollywood to Sacramento. </p> <p>Co-author Lawrence Gipe says the book was inspired by the governor's own words and actions. \"It recontextualises the silliest of our governor's quotes - 'I think that gay marriage should be between a man and a woman' - into the juvenile setting they deserve,\" he says. </p> <p>And yet, while Schwarzenegger's prop, in a costly new ad campaign, is a sober state flag (along with the caption \"Arnold says California Wants Your Business\"); while the Austrian post office has just announced that it will produce 600,000 stamps bearing his face (prominently labelled Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger); and while his official website celebrates the passage of California's balanced budget, it also promotes the release of his Predator movies on DVD: extras include an If It Bleeds, We Can Kill It: The Making of Predator documentary. </p> <p>It doesn't seem to hurt: his political coffers are filling up faster than those of any California governor before him, and he has raised $2m a month since January - more than enough to repay the debts incurred during last year's recall vote and to begin salting some away for his 2006 re-election campaign. And in fact, he still sees himself as the Terminator, as he admitted to an interviewer on Monday - \"because I'm relentless, and will not stop until something gets done\". <br> <b>Edward Helmore </b></p>",
  "Wow. The results of the new Yellow Pages survey - which calculates which categories of profession have expanded and which have imploded since 1992 - would almost make you think that we are a generation of overweight, surface-obsessed, mumbo-jumbo worshippers. <p>Let's see, makeup artists are up 1,007% and aromatherapists up 5,200%, while good old traditional gamekeepers and carpenters are on the way out. Cosmetic surgery is up 1,780% as, understandably, we all want to look like Jordan, Joan Collins or Anne Robinson, before we rush off to ruin all that hard work by rushing off to a sunbed parlour (up 299%). </p> <p>And, as if we weren't spoilt enough, we are hothousing our darling ruined children so that they can make even more money to waste on complete fripperies - home tutoring is up 601%. </p> <p>The biggest downward trend is greengrocers - there are 59% fewer of them. This is entirely obvious, of course - just look around at your local high street, or try to avoid those bores on the Atkins diet. Along with the people on programmes like the poo-analysing \"You Are What You Eat\", it seems that, rather than consuming the recommended five portions of fruit and veg a day, everyone in the country is managing to survive on absolutely none at all. </p> <p>Meanwhile, dieticians and weight-control experts are up by an astonishing 1,445%. Duh! Who are all these incredibly bad dieticians who are failing to tell their clients to \"get thee to the greengrocer\"? I bet they are selling them junk-meal replacements. Haven't they heard the mantra of that high priestess of junk culture, Paris Hilton? \"Only fat people eat low fat!\" </p> <p>In truth, I don't think the news is that bad. After all, on even the most generous estimates, only about 10% of all work done is vital in providing us with basic food, clothing, shelter and medical care. Everything else is just a case of finding people something to do all day to stop them going to the pub. This mostly involves getting them to push bits of paper about and inventing things such as \"human resources\" and \"personal injury lawyers\". So, once our basic needs for shelter, food and clothing are met - and for the vast majority of us, they certainly are - it is nice to know that we are not truly interested in anything more aggressive than sticking heated glass cups on our backs. Plus, in a country that no longer makes or builds anything much, you would not want to let that BA in aromatherapy from the University of East Central Frinton go to waste. </p> <p>What we are also seeing here is women buying things, too, which is why hardware outlets have dropped 34%. Now the Pope is allowing us out to work, there is just no stopping us crazy girls. You might imagine that in a culture that demands we make the best of ourselves, and where we are encouraged to believe we can do anything - while simultaneously being expected to stay at home fingerpainting with our children all day and being ravishing sex kittens to avoid our husbands leaving us - it is probably understandable that we are running around like mad things, trying to buy ourselves happiness and perfection. </p> <p>Obviously the more benign the spending, the better: paying someone \u00a380 an hour to get your feet massaged, for example, (reflexology is up 829%) is infinitely preferable to requesting that someone cuts up your body with a big knife to make you look more like Sharon Osbourne. Look on the bright side: it could be massive increases in \"All-New Underage Chimney Sweeps\"; \"Cheap Offal\", \"Slum Landlords-Are-Us\" and \"Backstreet Abortions Inc\". </p> <p>I like the Yellow Pages' findings: they make me feel that we don't have too much to worry about. Apart from being wiped out by terrorists (which, like global warming, is too huge a concept to get your head round, and thus best ignored in favour of eating crisps and reading articles about lipstick), our concerns are all our own. We may not be happy, but we are, on the whole, safe enough to be daft enough to spend our cash on pampering, preening and out-and-out charlatans. </p> <p>Why, you would almost think of us as a vain, silly people - the kind who, for example, would be against invading and occupying foreign countries for no good reason based on dodgy evidence. Which we are, not that it seemed to help us very much at the time. </p> <p>And yes, things are certainly looking bleak for the butcher and the baker - but, thanks to all our lovely new-age sensibilities, the number of candlestick-makers is up 208%. </p> <p><b>A plague on Tudor houses</b><br></p> <p>No more nouveau Palladia-bethan abominations. No more oversized Doric columns supporting huge glazed semicircles of bulletproof glass. No more original Georgian surround-sound cinema screen rooms. Thank God the government is finally doing something about the hideous monstrosities of the rich that are marching across the countryside, and suggesting that people try to build new and interesting things instead. </p> <p>\"It's terrible, and very elitist,\" says the traditionalist architect Quinlan Terry, proving, yet again, that anyone who uses elitist as a criticism is an idiot. Call me nuts, but, given the choice, I'd quite like my architecture to be elite, thanks. </p> <p>Architect Robert Adam (you just have to love that name - \"I like your house.\" \"Oh, thanks, it's Robert Adam, actually\"), pastiche-monger to the wealthy, splutters, \"It's absolutely horrible,\" by coincidence almost exactly the same words that are used by most people on viewing the gin-palace eyesores currently buggering up Surrey, all the vomitous mis- proportioned offspring of the Acropolis and a Tudor coaching inn, with triple garages. </p> <p><b>Ukip hooray on Gibraltar's birthday</b><br>  Happy birthday, Gibraltar, where the smell of monkeys, tax-free fags and all-day breakfasts is never far away. How nice to celebrate it with a show of military might through the centre of town, marching up and down, sticking their tongues out at our fellow Europeans. </p> <p>This sits well with the fact that the government of Gibraltar has refused to show its accounts to Britain for more than three years. Oh, and two of its seven MEPs are Ukip, which seems entirely fitting given the fondness that party's leadership already shows for Spain. God Save the Queen.</p>",
  "We must start with the history bit. In August 1704, in the conflict with France and Spain known as the war of the Spanish succession, the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eug\u00e8ne of Savoy administered a crushing defeat to Marshal Tallard at Blenheim. Meanwhile, the Anglo-Dutch fleet under Admiral Sir George Rooke was striving for mastery in the Mediterranean. An attempt to seize Cadiz failed. A descent on Barcelona was easily repulsed. <p>Anxious for some kind of victory, Rooke turned his attentions to the ruined fort of Gibraltar, garrisoned by only 150 men. This, at least, was within his powers. A landing force seized the rocky, desolate prize in the name of Charles III, allied candidate for the throne of Spain. </p> <p>The principal consequence of his action was that it provoked the French fleet to an engagement off M\u00e1laga on August 13. The battle was indecisive, but the French eventually withdrew, leaving Rooke to claim victory and retain Gibraltar, its rocky heights boasting British defiance of the Dons through the 300 years that followed. </p> <p>Amid all the battles which punctuated British occupation, I have always enjoyed the diary kept by a British soldier identified only as \"SH\", during the siege of 1727-28. \"January 2nd. Here is nothing to do nor any news, all things being dormant and in suspense, with the harmless diversions of drinking, dancing, revelling, whoring, gaming and other innocent debaucheries to pass the time - and really, to speak my own opinion - I think and believe that Sodom and Gomorrah were not half so wicked and profane as this worthy city and garrison of Gibraltar.\" </p> <p>All this magnificent heritage is being extravagantly celebrated on the Rock this week, with a Royal Navy frigate firing 21-gun salutes, bands playing in the streets, Geoff Hoon representing Her Majesty's government. The defence secretary has not been standing at the Spanish frontier holding a banner proclaiming: \"Stuff the Spanish\". But that is the burden of the refrain. </p> <p>You couldn't make it up, could you? We are in the 21st century. We are Europeans. The strategic significance of Gibraltar to Britain is rather less than that of Rockall. Unlike the Falklands and Argentina, the Rock is physically attached to Spain. Who can be surprised that its continued status as a bastion of British empire makes the Spanish very angry indeed? </p> <p>At an Anglo-Spanish political conference a few years ago, I was impressed by the number of thoughtful liberal Spanish delegates who emphasised to the British that Gibraltar is not merely a jingo issue which their government occasionally makes a fuss about. It is a source of deep-seated resentment. </p> <p>Yet a British Labour government thinks it politic to dispatch a warship and a cabinet minister to join the celebrations. Perhaps Tony Blair is so cross about Spain's withdrawal of its soldiers from Iraq, and so despairing of any amiable colloquy about Europe with Spain's socialist government that he doesn't care any more. </p> <p>Maybe these gestures are of a piece with insisting upon John Scarlett's appointment as director of the secret service, and Peter Mandelson's dispatch to Brussels. The prime minister is in a mood to suit himself and whatever understanding he has reached with God. Yet even many of those of us who have become sceptical about joining the euro or signing the European constitution want Britain to engage constructively with Europe. How likely are we to achieve this if we flaunt the union flag in the face of the Spanish in a manner worthy of the British National party? </p> <p>Gibraltar is, or should be, a serious embarrassment to any British government. Its principal economic activities today are financial, many of these of the most dubious and sordid kind. A few years ago, during the Major era, the Secret Intelligence Service warned the Foreign Office about both the range of potential financial scandals brewing in Gibraltar, and the number of prominent local citizens involved. There was much hand-wringing about this in Whitehall, but nothing was done. </p> <p>The political leadership of Gibraltar, whose status - and often personal prosperity - derives solely from control of a private dunghill protected by the union flag, can always raise a whirlwind. The British tabloid press, saloon bar sentiment, not to mention the Tory party, are all violently hostile to a surrender of the Rock. There is no pretence that this is rational. It is emotional and nostalgic, protected by a figleaf of principle about the absolute rights of local populations, however tiny. </p> <p>Here we are in the same political minefield as that which surrounds the Falklands. Lunching with a Labour cabinet minister in 1997, I said how welcome was the prospect that a Blair government would start talks on a deal with Argentina. My guest leaned across the table: \"What's in it for us?\" he demanded. \"The media and the Falklands lobby would go mad. About six people like you would applaud.\" </p> <p>That was the end of the story, of course. There seems every prospect that the Falklands will remain attached to the UK into the 22nd century. Most British people don't care one way or the other. A small minority cares obsessively, and can persuade any government that doing the right thing is more trouble than it is worth. </p> <p>It is ludicrous to suggest that the populations of such places as the Falklands or Gibraltar should possess an absolute veto on all debate about their future. It is also hypocritical, given that the Tory government in 1973 summarily evacuated the 1,200 inhabitants of Diego Garcia to free up the place for use as a US base. They were not white, though of course that made no difference.</p> <p>Two years ago, friends at the top of the Foreign Office told me that Jack Straw was committed to make a decisive move about Gibraltar. In the event, the Foreign Office was humiliated. Gibraltar's politicians organised rallies, demos, protests. The British media played up, or rather down, nobly. </p> <p>The government retreated. Today, that same government has dispatched Hoon to add official glamour to the 300th anniversary celebrations, unless the choice of the defence secretary represents an elaborate joke by Downing Street. </p> <p>The Spanish, like the Argentines, have sorely damaged their own cause by threatening and abusing Gibraltarians - and Falklanders - rather than wooing them. Yet the fact that Britain cannot summon the will to extricate itself from Gibraltar suggests a nation - us, not them - which has not grown up. The celebrations should embarrass us, not because we need blush about our imperial heritage - good for Admiral Rooke, say I - but because what happened in 1704 is properly irrelevant to the present or future of either Britain or Gibraltar. It is as absurd to keep the union flag flying over Gibraltar as to have done so over Blenheim. Until as a nation we can swallow that message, we must be perceived as wearing short trousers.</p>",
  "<p>Edgar G Ulmer was Hollywood's poverty row magician. As Peter Bogdanovich wrote: \"Nobody has ever made good pictures faster or for less money\". \"What he could do with nothing remains an object lesson for those directors, myself included, who complain about tight budgets and schedules.\" </p> <p>In his 40 years as a director, Ulmer made some of the most ingenious and disturbing B movies in Hollywood history. His best-known picture, Detour, was shot in less than a week for under $20,000 and yet boasts production design and lighting as inventive as anything found in the huge budget German silent era classics, on which he served his apprenticeship. </p> <p>It's symptomatic of the neglect into which Ulmer has fallen in Britain that the only one of his films readily available on DVD is The Naked Venus (1958), a tiny budget tale about a French artist's model who joins an American nudist colony. It seems an unlikely assignment, but Arianne Cipes Ulmer, the director's daughter, explains: \"My mother and father were both nudists. Part of the Germanic fresh air movement of their lifetime.\" </p> <p>With its shots of naked Americans playing volleyball and creaky courtroom scenes in which the model makes a stirring plea on behalf of nudists everywhere, the film is a poor advertisement for its director's abilities: there are, for instance, few of his trademark lighting effects or elaborate tracking shots. But Naked Venus is an intriguing introduction to Ulmer's work. </p> <p>Ulmer was born in 1904 in Moravia. His father, Siegfried Ulmer, served in the Austrian army during the first world war, and died when Edgar was 12. As an adolescent in war-ravaged Vienna, he experienced poverty and anti-semitism; but such was his precocious talent that he found a job as a stage designer for director Max Reinhardt. Before long he established himself in the German film industry of the 1920s, working as a production designer (a role he created) on The Golem, Metropolis and Sunrise. </p> <p>The crowning glory of his first stint in Hollywood was The Black Cat (1934), a typical Ulmer mish-mash, combining gothic elements, incongruous romantic comedy and Bauhaus design. The film is genuinely scary, setting Bela Lugosi as a traumatised man returning home from the war against Boris Karloff as an architect with satanic leanings. Although The Black Cat was a notable box-office success, Ulmer was forced into exile when he fell in love with Shirley Castle. She was married to Max Alexander - Universal chief Carl Laemmle's nephew. Ulmer and Shirley eloped to New York during the depression, leaving their careers in tatters behind them. \"He never reconciled with Laemmle. Nor did my mother with the entire Laemmle family,\" says Arianne. </p> <p>Just when he was close to despair, Ulmer was hired to make a series of films for the booming Yiddish-language market. In the early 1940s, he was lured back to Hollywood to work for Producers' Releasing Corporation (PRC). Thus began his years on what was nicknamed \"Poverty Row\", making films in flea-pit studios on tiny budgets. Arianne says he didn't feel bitter about this: \"Fame and money were not issues. He really only wanted to have the opportunity to work and express himself.\" </p> <p>Perhaps Ulmer's masterpiece was Ruthless (1948), his \"low-rent Citizen Kane\" as it was dubbed. This is a quintessentially American tale about a kid from the wrong side of the tracks. Horace Woodruff Vendig (Zachary Scott) escapes his impoverished background, makes it rich, but ruins the lives of everybody with whom he comes into contact in the process. Told in flashback, it's a dark and depressing tale about the hollowness of success. </p> <p>Though his background was as a designer, Ulmer worked brilliantly with actors, eliciting a pathetic but deeply moving performance from Sydney Greenstreet (the rotund, well-spoken villain from Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon) as the financier whom Vendig cuckolds, humiliates and bankrupts. In one scene, as Greenstreet realises that his wife is about to leave him, we see him staring in despair at his own reflection. In another, though broken and overweight, he makes a feeble attempt to throttle his tormentor. </p> <p>For many, though, the quintessential Ulmer film remains Detour. He described it as a morality fable about \"an absolute loser\". Al Roberts (Tom Neal) is a New York pianist who hitchhikes across country for a reunion with his girlfriend. En route, Al takes a ride with Haskell, a bookie who dies unexpectedly. Al steals the car and the man's identity, but then he picks up Vera (Ann Savage), a young delinquent who knew Haskell. Convinced that Al killed him, she begins to blackmail him. </p> <p>The film has the warped, nightmarish feel of a Kafka story. In fact it was adapted from a \"very bad book\" by Martin Goldsmith. Ulmer transformed the material, cutting large chunks of the original narrative. His casting was astute. Neal and Savage bring just the right measure of desperation, viciousness and vulnerability to their roles. (In a gruesome case of life imitating art, Neal was later charged with the murder of his wife.) </p> <p>Detour alone would be enough to sustain Ulmer's reputation. By his own calculation, though, he made 127 other features. This month's season at the National Film Theatre includes only a fragment of his lifetime's work. His films reflected his protean imagination. \"My father was a deeply sensitive European mind wounded by war,\" says Arianne. \"He could laugh until the tears rolled down his cheeks and be so jovial or rage like bull or withdraw into his shell. Today we would have probably labelled him as manic-depressive. He was a workaholic but he had enormous capacity for joy, anger, humour and sensuality.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Edgar G Ulmer season is at the National Film Theatre, London SE1, until August 31.

  "<p>London was last night mopping up the floodwater and totting up the damage caused by Tuesday's freak storms, which left more than 10,000 dead fish floating down the Thames and brought chaos to the capital's transport system. </p> <p>The fish died after 600,000 tonnes of raw sewage overflowed into the river as a result of the thunderstorms. </p> <p>Oxygen levels in the Thames were reduced to virtually nil along a stretch from Kew, Brentford and Isleworth, with dead bream and roach piled up on the banks and floating belly up in the water. </p> <p>When sewage overflows cause oxygen depletion, Thames Water uses two oxygenating barges to \"bubble\" life back into the river, but the boats could not be used this far upstream. </p> <p>Instead large quantities of hydrogen peroxide were added - another emergency measure to try to save any surviving fish. </p> <p>Thames Water said in a statement: \"With thousands of adult fish floating dead in the river there is a clear concern of the environmental impact and potential health implications. </p> <p>\"The operation may take days to manage as the tidal effect means the storm sewage will move up and down with the current.\" </p> <p>The storms caused severe disruptions to London's tube and bus services. Many remained suspended yesterday and a number of roads across the country were hit by the floods, leaving commuters with long car journeys home. </p> <p>Transport workers in the capital were still working to clear the District and Metropolitan lines yesterday. On the roads, a few routes remained closed in London, Derbyshire and Greater Manchester. </p> <p>The violent weather also claimed the life of Joseph Wharton, a 14-year-old who died after being hit by lightning in the West Midlands on Tuesday morning. </p> <p>A 15-year-old girl was still in a critical condition yesterday after being struck by lightning in Hyde Park in central London. </p> <p>Travellers flying from Heathrow were also affected, as the storms led to delays and cancellations of flights. </p> <p>\"Passengers travelling from Heathrow today are strongly urged to contact their airline to check the status of their flight,\" said a spokesman for the airport operator BAA. </p> <p>The environmental group Friends of the Earth said the storms showed just how unprepared the capital was for the extreme weather which would be brought about by climate change. </p> <p>Jenny Bates, the group's London campaigns coordinator, accepted the running of sewage into the Thames was the \"lesser of two evils\" - preferable to letting it flood the streets. </p> <p>But she warned that action needed to be taken to prevent future problems. </p> <p>\"We need to be more aware that this is is the sort of thing that could happen in the future so we need to take climate change and the effect of it more seriously,\" she said. </p> <p>Forecasters warned last night that more storms were expected across the country. </p> <p>The worst-affected areas were expected to be the north and east of England, while southern Scotland and the south-east could also experience downpours. </p> <p>Conditions are expected to improve towards the weekend, with Saturday forecast to have the best of the weather.</p>",
  "America's religious right claimed a victory yesterday in the campaign to cast November's elections as a struggle over public morality after a battleground state voted for a constitutional ban on gay marriage. <p>Some 71% of voters in Missouri supported amending the state's constitution to ban same-sex unions. \"I'm very gratified ... that the people of this state understand our current policy is a wise public policy and they want to see it protected from a legal challenge,\" said Vicky Hartzler, from the Coalition to Protect Marriage in Missouri. </p> <p>Hours later, a county court judge in Washington state arrived at a different conclusion about the institution of marriage, ruling that it would be unconstitutional to deny gay couples the right to wed. However, the state will await the legal opinion of a higher court before it issues marriage licences to same-sex couples. </p> <p>The high-profile divisions on gay marriage all but guarantee the issue a place in the elections, especially in battleground states across the American midwest. </p> <p>Missouri was the first of as many as 12 states scheduled to vote on the constitutionality of same-sex marriages in the coming weeks. </p> <p>A number of those ballots are in fiercely contested states such as Ohio and Michigan, and gay activists said yesterday they feared the issue would be used to mobilise conservative voters. </p> <p>\"The vote indicates that we have some work to do in educating people on why these amendments are discriminatory, and why it is not good to use the constitution to decide these kinds of social issues,\" said Seth Kilbourn of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organisation. </p> <p>Gay marriage became a touchstone of the conservative agenda last year after judges in Massachusetts legalised same-sex weddings. </p> <p>While conservative states moved to legislate against such unions, cities from San Francisco to Plattsburgh in New York state tried to push the boundaries of the law by officiating over same-sex weddings. </p> <p>On one level, bans such as Missouri's are symbolic. It, like about 37 other states, has statutes restricting marriage to heterosexuals. Opponents of gay marriage say they fear courts could force the recognition of unions conducted elsewhere. Others dismiss the bans as bigotry. </p> <p>But the importance of gay marriage in the elections is undeniable. </p> <p>In February George Bush said he supported changing the US constitution to ban gay marriage, although it is acknowledged he has no chance of marshalling the required votes. </p> <p>John Kerry, his Democratic challenger, opposes a constitutional ban but he does not support gay marriage either.</p>",
  "The fog of war has descended over the campaign. Within 72 hours of the end of the Democratic convention, the department of homeland security declared a new terror alert, and the colour-coded level was jacked up to orange, verging on red. The reason, the government reported, was that the computer of an al-Qaida operative captured in Pakistan contained precise information about threats to five financial institutions in New York and Washington. <p>Then additional information was released: the intelligence was mostly three years old, the al-Qaida surveillance of US buildings had been mostly conducted through the internet, the computer file had been opened again in January for uncertain reason and with no new surveillance data added to it, and Pakistani officials said that the captured material indicated no new al-Qaida planning. </p> <p>The effect of the alert has been to throw the campaign into turmoil and momentarily freeze it. John Kerry decided to accept the administration's explanations at face value. His critique of Bush's war on terrorism must be made with iron discipline, based on the facts, not suspicions. Yet other Democrats claimed the administration was using the situation for political advantage, putting additional pressure on Kerry, who has to hold fast. </p> <p>In part, the level of partisanship increased because of the clumsy performance of Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, who turned the announcement into a political rally. \"We must understand that the kind of information available to us today is the result of the president's leadership in the war against terror,\" he said. Whether planned politically or not, the alert exposed that, for Bush, it is the irreducible basis of his campaign. And while it starkly elevated his profile as the \"war president\" again, it also revealed indirectly the vacuum of his second-term programme. His hard-right issues are insufficient for a national majority, he is weak on the realities of homeland security, and he is desperate to smudge the history of his inactions leading to 9/11 and his responsibility for the deterioration of the Iraqi situation. </p> <p>The widespread cynicism about the alerts, which may have no grounding, is a product of Bush's intense politicisation of national security and his record of misleading statements about almost every aspect of war. </p> <p>The 9/11 commission report is a devastating record of Bush's passivity on terrorism, beginning with his first act: the demotion of the counterterrorism chief, Richard Clarke. The report documents that the administration \"was not ready to confront Islamabad\" on its support for the Taliban or to \"engage actively against al-Qaida\" and that it \"did not develop new diplomatic initiatives on al-Qaida with the Saudi government\". Bush told the commission that the August 6 2001 presidential daily brief, \"Bin Laden Determined To Strike In US\" was \"historical in nature\", though it contained current information. The neoconservatives, such as deputy secretary of defence Paul Wolfowitz, are depicted as dismissive - Wolfowitz opposed retaliation for the al-Qaida attack on the USS Cole as \"stale\" -and obsessed with Iraq as the source of all terrorism. </p> <p>Bush's campaign must try to blur memory of his history. When Kerry seized upon the commission's recommendations, Bush reacted by endorsing a new national intelligence chief. But he would give this new post no control over budget, no White House office, no power over personnel, and no authority over intelligence operations. Once again, he appeared to be acting only on political motives. </p> <p>Various bills for homeland security languish before the Congress, as Bush neglects them. His paltry $46m proposal for port security is more than $1bn short of what the US Coast Guard says is required. On port security, 10 Democratic amendments have already been defeated while Bush has slept. He prefers the money to be appropriated for tax cuts for the upper bracket. </p> <p>Bush is haunted not only by the ghosts of his own past but the ghosts of other presidents past. While he attempts to redeem his father's political fall by avoiding his mistakes, his effort at reversal is creating a similar estrangement from the voters. Elder Bush won his war against Iraq and withdrew without toppling Saddam; his ratings were then at their peak. But his obliviousness to economic circumstances undermined the heroic image. Lyndon Johnson had an ambitious domestic agenda backed by a landslide mandate. But he squandered it in the Vietnam quagmire; his political credibility undermined his party's for a generation. Now, Bush's faltering credibility is tearing at trust in US national security. Perversely, his campaign must exploit the fears that his failures have helped engender. For him, this is not a war of choice, but necessity. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal is former senior adviser to President Clinton and Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",

Except in the twisted logic of the bitterly partisan, there is no reason for Mr Bush to fake terrorist threats, especially against financial institutions, when he needs economic growth and stability for re-election. No real-world benefit accrues to him from threats that could shake market confidence. </p> <p>\"What is nearly as frightening as terrorist chatter is the degree of cynicism that makes the war on terror political. As we count down the weeks to the November election, each political party attacking the other, the terrorist sets his clock by eternity, patiently biding time for his window, which some seem willing to leave open.

  "<p>Munich's plan to move its desktop PCs from Microsoft Windows to Linux by 2009 has apparently been called into question. In this case, however, \"apparently\" means \"not really\". What we are actually seeing is an attack on the German government's love affair with software patents. </p> <p>It's a love affair unfortunately shared by the UK, France and others. We could face the same problem. </p> <p>The question was raised by Wilhelm Hoegner, Munich's chief information officer, who said it was indispensable to check the consequences the European Union's adoption of software patents would have on open source software. Any such oversight could, he said, be a \"catastrophe for Munich's Linux migration project, and for open source in general\". </p> <p>This was followed by Jens Muehlhaus, an alderman from the Green party, who filed two motions calling on Christian Ude, Munich's mayor, to contact the government for advice. This directed the pressure where it belongs: Munich can do nothing about software patents; the German government can. </p> <p>What had been a local affair was made global by Florian Mueller, an adviser to MySQL, who issued an English version of the Greens' statement via PR Newswire. He also posted it on Slashdot, the pro-Linux website. The quotations are taken from Mueller's version. </p> <p>Muehlhaus also says: \"A cursory search revealed that the Linux 'base client', which the city of Munich plans to install on the desktop computers of approximately 14,000 employees, is in conflict with more than 50 European software patents.\" This search was performed by the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (<a href=\"http://www.ffii.org\">www.ffii.org</a>), Europe's leading anti-software-patent activist group. </p> <p>If anyone tried to exercise these patent rights, it could \"massively hinder\" Munich's developments or even take the city administration out of operation, says the release. </p> <p>Of course, this is not an anti-open source attempt to discredit Linux or discourage Munich, but a pro-open source attempt to put pressure on the German government. The idea is to present legislators in general with a stark choice between software patents and open source, and thus encourage them to choose the latter. </p> <p>Although software patents apply to all forms of software, they are a bigger threat to open source, for two main reasons. First, patent violations are easier to find in open source code than in unreadable binaries. Second, the open source movement has no mechanism for accumulating its own patent portfolio, and thus taking the industry standard route of patent cross-licensing. This system requires even people who don't believe in software patents to get as many as they can, to have something to trade. </p> <p>The alternative to cross-licensing - paying for patent rights - is not practical for open source developers: none of them makes a significant amount of money. All they can really do is program round them. </p> <p>Ironically, the biggest campaigner for software patents in Europe, and the company with by far the biggest patent portfolio, is also the one that wants to supply Munich's computer systems: IBM.</p> <p> <strong> Links</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Greens of Munich press release</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://masl.to/?J5E8215F8\"> http://masl.to/?J5E8215F8</a></p> <p> <strong> Florian Mueller's version</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://masl.to/?V4D8525F8\">http://masl.to/?V4D8525F8</a></p> <p> <strong> Munich's Linux Migration Raises EU Patent Issues (Slashdot)</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://masl.to/?E30C223F8\"> http://masl.to/?E30C223F8</a> </p> <p> <strong> IBM and Software Patents</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://masl.to/?H209235F8\"> http://masl.to/?H209235F8</a> </p> <p> <strong> IBM sustains patent dominance</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://masl.to/?P32C263F8\"> http://masl.to/?P32C263F8</a> </p> <p> <strong> Software's game of mutually assured damage</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://masl.to/?R3C8255F8\"> http://masl.to/?R3C8255F8</a></p>",

  "Writers, politicians and film-makers from more than a dozen countries have offered their support to the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, who faces a referendum this month on his future. <p>The group have signed a manifesto saying that, if they were Venezuelan, they would vote for Chavez in what will be a volatile contest. The manifesto is being launched as opponents of Mr Chavez claim he has \"kidnapped\" the electoral council responsible for overseeing the vote. </p> <p>Signatories include the Argentinian Nobel peace prize winner Adolfo Perez, the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano, the musician Chico Buarque and the architect Niemeyer, both from Brazil, and British film-makers Ken Loach, Alex Cox and Mike Hodges, writers Harold Pinter and Eric Hobsbawm and politicians Tony Benn and Ken Livingstone. </p> <p>In their manifesto, aimed at garnering international support for Mr Chavez, the signatories say they \"wish to express our solidarity with the struggle that, alongside President Hugo Chavez, the majority of the Venezuelan people are waging in defence of their right to freely determine their future. </p> <p>\"At the same time, we wish to denounce the disinformation campaign that is being orchestrated by the major media and that attempts to characterise as a tyrant, a president who has consistently respected the rule of law and the country's constitution.\" </p> <p>The leftwing former army officer was elected with a landslide victory in 1998. He has since faced many attempts to unseat him, from a short-lived military coup in 2002 to a lengthy national strike. Opposition leaders have accused him of behaving in an autocratic way, of seriously damaging the economy and of wanting to turn the country into another Cuba. His supporters claim the US has been undermining his government because of his anti-Iraq war stance and fears of disruption to oil supplies from the world's fifth largest exporter. </p> <p>The referendum is taking place after more than 2 million people signed a petition to submit the president to a recall vote. </p> <p>The pro-Chavez signatories ask in their manifesto: \"How many heads of state would have the courage to put their popularity to the test before finishing their term? </p> <p>\"Hugo Chavez has demonstrated this courage and has thus given a democratic lesson to the sectors of the Venezuelan opposition that have, in the past, resorted to coup d'\u00e9tats, economic sabotage, lies and managerial lockouts in an attempt to undermine the country's constitutional order.\" </p> <p>The referendum is still due on August 15 despite problems with voter registration. </p> <p>Both sides have accused each other of irregularities and attempting to manipulate the process, which will be attended by international observers in the form of a mission set up by the Organisation of American States and the former US president Jimmy Carter.</p>",
  "Eyewitnesses yesterday gave dramatic accounts of a series of coordinated anti-terrorist raids across England that led to 12 people being detained and questioned at the top-security Paddington Green police station in west London. <p>Relatives and neighbours expressed shock at the arrests and questioned the police tactics. Five people were arrested in Willesden, north London, one later released; one in Sudbury, north London; one in Wembley, north London; two in Paddington; two in Blackburn; one in Luton and one in Bushey, Hertfordshire. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Willesden, north London</b><br> Terence Costa, an immigration adviser, was just leaving his office above the Golden Touch barber's in Willesden High Road when his routine day was interrupted. In the flat above, on the top floor, David (who did not want to give his full name) had just given his 14-year-old daughter her lunch and, outside the barber's, the owner Steve was sitting in his girlfriend's car as he took a breather. </p> <p>David, glancing out of the window, saw them first: \"They came from both ends of the street; there were hundreds of armed police. They were running into the shops opposite, then these vehicles tore up the road and parked horizontally across the street.\" Seconds later Steve looked up and saw a young Asian man running towards his barber's shop. \"The police were chasing him. They shouted at me, 'Don't move, he's dangerous.' I thought, 'Oh no, he's heading for my shop.'\" </p> <p>As scores of officers shouting \"armed police\" pursued the man, a 10-year-old girl was knocked flying on the pavement. </p> <p>Mr Costa noticed none of this as he reached the doorway to the street and came face-to-face with the fleeing suspect. \"I had just reached the bottom of the stairs and this guy ran past me into the barber shop. He was about 23, he had short hair. I'd never seen him in the area before.\" </p> <p>Before he had a chance to register what was going on Mr Costa was confronted by police. \"All these officers came towards me carrying guns, they ordered me back up the stairs and into my office.\" </p> <p>Four anti-terrorist officers were left in Mr Costa's office as their colleagues charged up the next flight of steps and burst into David's flat, shouting: \"Armed police, get down now.\" </p> <p>\"Jess, my daughter was under the table, I just grabbed her and hit the floor,\" David said. \"She was screaming and crying.\" With the father and daughter face down on the floor, a few officers moved into the bedrooms and flipped over the beds in their search of the flat. \"Even the plumber who was working in the hallway was ordered into my flat and told to hit the floor.\" </p> <p>Eventually all three were allowed to stand up.\"I saw them leading this young guy out, they had wrapped him in a blue forensic suit and led him into a van.\" </p> <p>David said the officers had told him they had been watching the suspect and had decided to arrest him as he approached the barber's shop. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Bushey, Hertfordshire</b><br> In the leafy suburb of Bushey neighbours watched from behind curtains as forensic teams searched a detached house a few miles from the country club yesterday. </p> <p>Twenty-four hours earlier armed police had burst into the whitewashed property, known as the White House, and arrested 21-year-old Omar Rehman, whose father Mahmud is a wholesale fishmonger. </p> <p>A locksmith was busy yesterday repairing the damage as teams of police searched the house in Little Bushey Lane, in the heart of the stockbroker belt of Hertfordshire. Roger Walker, a neighbour, said the family, had lived next door to him for 14 years. </p> <p>\"They brought their children up here,\" he said. \"The daughter Sofia went to Watford grammar school. The son was a student and spent a lot of time at home. </p> <p>\"They are a lovely family, I see them to say hello to. They have always been very pleasant.\" </p> <p>A few weeks ago the Rehmans celebrated their daughter Sofia's wedding and neighbours said the 24-year-old newlywed was thought to still be on her honeymoon in Istanbul. </p> <p>\"I saw them all go off in a minibus. They were all dressed up,\" Mr Walker said. </p> <p>As residents cleaned their convertible sports cars on their driveways yesterday they expressed shock at the events of the past 24 hours. </p> <p>\"I saw the mother go off in her car in the morning and then went off to work as usual,\" Mr Walker said. </p> <p>\"When I came home about 2.45pm I saw all the police. There were about a dozen police and five vehicles. </p> <p>\"I asked them what was going on; they said it didn't concern me. This is normally such a quiet area.\" </p> <p>Neighbours said the two grown-up children had adopted more traditional Muslim dress and appeared to have become more religious over the past four years. </p> <p>Their father worked long hours in London, according to local people. \"He always left very early in the morning to go up to the city,\" one said. \"He is a charming man.\" </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Blackburn, Lancashire</b><br> Police from the Lancashire and Metropolitan forces raided four houses and a tyre depot in Blackburn yesterday after two men were arrested at gunpoint and pulled from a gold Mercedes in the town on Tuesday. </p> <p>Two of the raided premises, a modern semi in Malham Gardens, close to the tyre depot, and a terrace house in Shakeshaft Street, a few hundred metres away, were said to be the homes of or to be owned by two Asian businessmen. </p> <p>Local people named them as Butch Feroze and Zamir Hussain, but their identities have not been confirmed by police. </p> <p>The sources said the tyre depot, also searched by police, was run by Mr Feroze's elder brother Javaid. </p> <p>A house in Whalley New Road, believed to be his home, was searched by police. The fifth raid was at a quiet semi in Little Harwood, which a married couple and four young children were ordered to leave by officers bearing a search warrant. </p> <p>Mr Feroze and Mr Hussain were said to work together, buying and selling high- performance cars including Ferraris and Lamborghinis. \"If it is those two who have been arrested, it's absolutely ridiculous,\" said Mohammed Yusof, who works at an MOT centre next door to the Lower Audley Tyre Centre, which police raided late on Tuesday. Forensic teams continued searching there yesterday. </p> <p>\"They are Asian businessmen, that's all. I chill with them, I socialise with them. They would not have anything to do with terrorism or anything like that.\" </p> <p>At a pharmacy opposite the house in Whalley New Road, Tahir Shah said: \"Javaid is a very well respected businessman and a very hard worker. I'm always seeing him driving over to his garage first thing in the morning. He is the last person I would expect to be involved in terrorism.\" </p> <p>Soab Patel described how police had arrived at the newly extended home of his brother Ayub in Greenhead Avenue, and told him, his wife Hasena and their four young children to leave just before midnight. </p> <p>They told Ayub Patel, who was not arrested, that the family would have to stay with relatives or go to a hotel, an order which reduced Mrs Patel and her children to tears. </p> <p>\"My brother has been a businessman for 10 years,\" Soab Patel said. \"He has never been involved in any crime. I'm going to take this further - it's absolutely scandalous.\" </p> <p>Mr Patel told the officers they had a duty to search the house. \"But I told them, 'If you don't find anything, I want an apology. You are putting a label on our family. Who is going to remove it?'\" </p> <p><b> Luton, Bedfordshire</b><br> In Luton residents told how police halted a car as it pulled into their quiet, residential street and seized the driver at gunpoint. Witnesses said the man, described as of Asian origin, had been held trapped between the driver's door and the body of the car in driving rain for almost three hours. </p> <p>Lincoln Leslie, 71, had been painting the windows of his house in Alexandra Avenue, half a mile north of the town centre. The retired engineer said: \"Suddenly there were loads of police officers. I thought there must have been an accident until an officer armed with a machine gun walked up the road to redirect the traffic.\" </p> <p>Police sealed the area off. Mr Leslie said: \"The officers searched the man and appeared to be examining the car. They seemed to be talking into their radios as though they were waiting for instructions.\" Another witness, Greta Turner, 67, said: \"I saw it from my bedroom window. I saw three policemen with guns and knew it wasn't just a drug raid.\" </p> <p>Neighbours said the man, believed to be in his late 20s or early 30s, was eventually covered with a transparent plastic sheet and gloves, handcuffed and driven away. His car, thought to be a red Nissan, was taken away. </p> <p>After the arrest on Tuesday afternoon, officers stormed a flat in a modern block owned by a housing association in the Dallow Road area of Luton. One neighbour said: \"I looked through my peephole and saw loads of them in protective clothing and with riot shields and carrying a battering ram. There must have been more than 20 cops.\" </p> <p>The neighbour said a young man of Asian origin lived in the second floor flat with his wife or girlfriend. The neighbour said he believed the man was a decorator or plasterer. </p> <p>Two officers, one in uniform, the second in plainclothes, stood guard outside the door of the flat last night. Another officer left the flat carrying a police evidence bag containing computer disks and documents. </p> <p>Members of the Muslim community in Luton expressed concern. Community leaders were told of the operation as it began. But some Muslims are still smarting from raids carried out on six homes in March which attracted widespread publicity, but resulted in no arrests. </p> <p>Akbar Dad Khan of the group Building Bridges, which promotes harmony between faiths, said: \"There is real concern that the police are misusing the anti-terrorism laws. The authorities risk alienating our community.\"</p>",
  "The bald Home Office figures appear at first sight to tell a story of failure. Since September 11 2001 there have been 562 people arrested under the powers in the Terrorism 2000 Act. So far 97 of them have been charged and only 14 have actually been convicted. <p>But both the police and prosecution authorities stress that those figures do not tell the whole story and should be treated with caution. </p> <p>Ken Macdonald, the director of public prosecutions, has told MPs that he believes they are potentially mislead ing because there are a large number of anti-terrorism cases yet to come to court. </p> <p>\"So far as the discrepancy between the number of people arrested and the number of people charged is concerned, as a prosecutor that does not surprise me at all,\" he said in evidence to the joint human rights committee inquiry into the terrorism acts published yesterday. </p> <p>\"The test for arresting somebody is reasonable suspicion on the part of the police officer. We are always going to be consulted by the police as to what the charge should be. The test we apply is a much higher test and there is always going to be some wastage at that point.\" </p> <p>Mr Macdonald also said that quite often people who were arrested for terrorist offences are then prosecuted under other legislation. </p> <p>The Home Office confirmed yesterday that 152 people of the 562 arrested under the Terrorism Act were charged under other legislation or released into the custody of the immigration service. </p> <p>In fact the more accurate picture is that 280 out of the 562 people arrested under anti-terrorist powers since September 11 2001 have been released without charge - about half of those who have been taken in. </p> <p>The DPP said some of those charged under other legislation were often prosecuted for false identity offences or credit card frauds. </p> <p>Mike Todd, Manchester's chief constable and spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers on terrorism, has also claimed that it is wrong to characterise terrorism arrests as a failure if not everyone involved is charged. </p> <p>\"I do not necessarily regard that as a failure. Often it is a disruption, a deterrent,\" he recently told MPs. </p> <p>In April, in an operation led by Greater Manchester police, 10 people were arrested in a series of anti-terror raids. The nine men and one woman were arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism - but all were subsequently released without charge.</p>",
  "Five of Britain's category A jails are being equipped with a new biometric security system to scan the fingerprints of tens of thousands of visitors and prisoners. Matching photographs will also be stored. <p>Deployment of the Inmate Management System (IMS), which already features at a few privately-run institutions, is being expanded after development at two prisons and an immigration detention centre. </p> <p>The access-control procedure, devised by a London firm, Unilink Systems and Software, is intended to speed up the processing of visitors and ensure inmates do not escape by swapping places with visitors. Banned visitors can be more easily excluded and suspicious patterns of visits tracked. </p> <p>IMS will be installed at Woodhill, near Milton Keynes - where it goes live this week - as well as at Belmarsh, Manchester, Long Lartin, and Whitemore. All are high-security jails holding many of the most dangerous inmates, including terrorist suspects. </p> <p>The procedure, which the Home Office prefers to call a \"visitor recognition system\", saves records of visitors' fingerprints and their photographs on local computers. There is no plan at present to link all the jails' computers into a single network. </p> <p>The Home Office has not revealed the cost of the contract, agreed in a closed tender process, but it is thought to be about \u00a3200,000. </p> <p>The scans replace a biometric system that recorded the shape, or geometry, of hands. The Guardian understands that that system was scrapped because the computer response time slowed down as more records were stored. Several reports by the chief inspector of prisons criticised delays at Belmarsh caused by the procedure. The Home Office refused to reveal how much this previous system, installed in 1996, had cost. </p> <p>Electronic fingerprint scanning is increasingly popular for systems verifying identity which need to handle large numbers of people. The US uses similar methods, imposed after the September 11 attacks, for airport arrivals. </p> <p>Alternative biometric security checks using electronic scans of the iris were rejected both because the technology was too expensive - it is still under patent - and because it was thought too intrusive for visitors and inmates. </p> <p>Bronzefield, a women's jail, in Ashford, Middlesex, which opened in June and is run by the private firm UKDS, is the latest example of the enthusiasm for biometric security. It is equipped with an IMS, that also registered the staff. New visitors to the jail are photographed and electronic scans are taken of their left and right index fingers. There are nine scanners in the prison. </p> <p>\"The prisoners have been very happy with the system,\" said Dave Mcaulay, of UKDS. \"They can see the benefits of a system which streamlines the process. It's improved the efficiency of visits. If you get an ex-inmate coming in to visit the system can flash up if there's a record on their file of assaulting staff. It can help us.\" </p> <p>Staff insist there are no privacy implications since such information is already stored on the Prison Service's local inmate data system. </p> <p>The system's optical scanner records the information from the fingerprints as an algorithm. \"It measures the distances between the whorls in the fingerprint pattern,\" said Peter Whitaker, of Unilink, \"but it does not have enough information to reconstruct an image of a fingerprint.\" </p> <p>The system at Bronzefield already has 18,000 matching fingerprints and pictures. Staff say it pulls up information on prisoners and visitors almost instantaneously. Theoretically, scanners could also be used to control access to the prison's wings, though the Home Office says it has no plans for that. </p> <p>There has been some discussion about installing the system in courts to ensure that the correct prisoner goes on trial. At Harmondsworth immigration detention centre, near Heathrow, also run by UKDS and using IMS to monitor visits, there was a recent escape attempt by a detainee who tried to swap places with a visitor, according to Francis Toye, a director of Unilink. </p> <p>\"In France last year there was an inmate who swapped places with his twin and escaped,\" Mr Toye said. \"We believe our system makes prisons easier places to run.\" </p> <p>Fingerprint scanners can be fooled. A Japanese professor used gelatine to transfer a copy of someone else's prints on to his finger. The resources for such techniques are unlikely to be available in prison.</p>",

Now they have constructed models of global sulphur deposition and global wetland methane emissions between 1960 and 2080 to examine the effect of sulphur emissions on methane production. </p> <p>They calculate that sulphur pollution is reducing methane emissions by 8%, and they believe that this could increase to as much as 15% by 2030. </p> <p>Methane is estimated to be responsible for 22% of the greenhouse effect.

  "<p>David Cowan is a man with a lot of piss on his hands. About 650 litres of the stuff passes through his system each year, donated by everyone from millionaire premiership footballers and elite UK athletes to promising amateur sports stars. </p> <p>Cowan's drug testing laboratory at King's College London is where the sporting careers of record-breaking British pole vaulter Janine Whitlock and rising sprint star John Skeete ground to a halt after traces of banned stimulants were found in their urine (it was later found that Skeetes' supplements had been spiked). It is where Manchester United defender's Rio Ferdinand's sample would have been tested, had he supplied one (he didn't and is currently serving a ban). And it is where the bulk of Britain's Olympic team will have been screened before they head to Athens next week, for anabolic steroids, amphetamines, protein hormones, epitestosterone, darbopoetin and up to 500 other controlled substances that could illegally boost their chances. </p> <p>Entry to the laboratory is tightly controlled, for good reason. It handles 7-8,000 anonymous urine samples sent from across the UK every year, and each must be treated with great care and precision. In the event of a positive test, sports stars can send their own scientific experts or lawyers to sniff out sloppy procedures, or anything else that could save a shamed reputation. </p> <p>So when the Guardian was granted rare access to the lab last month, it was under strict instructions not to touch anything. </p> <p>It is not only the athletes who are preparing for the Olympics. Leading drug testers will gather in Athens, ready to pit their wits and skill against the cheats in a specially constructed facility that will work around the clock to test about 3,000 samples in all. </p> <p>The experts are facing unprecedented challenges. The Athens games are the first major event since the THG designer steroid scandal rocked athletics and saw British sprinter Dwain Chambers banned. The scientists have been forced to accept an unpalatable truth: their most dangerous opponents are now their own kind - rogue chemists specifically designing drugs to slip past the tests. </p> <p>The move caught anti-doping experts by surprise. \"That was new for me, because I was working on the basis that no sensible athlete would take a drug that hadn't gone through the proper testing,\" Cowan says. \"I was wrong. They're prepared to take substances of unknown toxicity, and that's scary. It's also a bit uncomfortable that there is clearly some connivance. There are some crazy scientific minds probably just making money out of designing things to beat the tests.\" </p> <p>Things could get worse. According to US scientists developing gene therapies to treat patients, several athletes have already asked about having their DNA rewritten to boost physique and stamina. In theory, athletes could inject genes to rapidly, and perhaps undetectably, increase muscle size and strength. Other gene techniques being tested to treat blood disorders could boost the numbers of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. \"I think it's on the horizon,\" Cowan says. \"But I don't think it's as near as everyone says it might be.\" </p> <p>Conventional thinking says sporting pressure and rewards have created a greater incentive than ever to cheat, and that dopers have become so sophisticated that the drug detectives on their trail are constantly one step behind. \"I'm not in total agreement with that,\" Cowan says. \"Is there more pressure to cheat? Our testing has improved over the years so it's a bit of a balance between the two, I'd say.\" In some cases, he says, the anti-dopers are ahead of the field: tests have already been developed for several new substances not yet abused in sport. </p> <p>Doping is no modern phenomenon. Olympic victories brought ancient Greek athletes tax exemptions and deferment from military service, and competitors would ingest any preparation they believed might enhance performance. Roman chariot racers are said to have doped themselves and their horses with mysterious herbal infusions in the search for speed. Much later, in the early years of the 20th century, brandy, strychnine, heroin and cocaine were all used widely. </p> <p>Neither is fighting the dopers new. The first recorded case of anti-doping came in 1865 when the organisers of an Amsterdam canal race expelled a swimmer for taking an unnamed performance-enhancing substance. </p> <p>The development of amphetamines in the 1930s raised the stakes. After a succession of deaths linked to the drug, British cyclist Tommy Simpson collapsed and died during the tough ascent of Mount Ventoux in the 1967 Tour de France. His death, brought on by heavy amphetamine use and caught on film, convinced the authorities that action was needed. Drug testing began at the Winter Olympics in Grenoble the following year. </p> <p>The early tests to detect amphetamine use were developed by the British chemist Arnold Beckett, with whom Cowan - an expert in the way drugs break down in the body over time - began working in the mid-1970s. </p> <p>\"As a naive academic I said 'look, we can't just occasionally get samples from sport because it disrupts the research. We need to do it properly',\" Cowan says. </p> <p>Screens to find anabolic steroids followed, and in 1985 the King's College operation became one of only a handful in the world to be accredited by the International Olympic Committee. </p> <p>The global operation against the cheats - now run by the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) - today boasts more than 30 labs. Last month, the horseracing forensics laboratory in Newmarket became the UK's second WADA-approved testing facility. </p> <p>Cowan may be less naive now, but he remains an academic and has interests away from sport. He is involved in criminal cases as a forensic toxicologist, and his group is one of a few in the world given a licence to let people take the dance floor drug ecstasy to test its effects. Neatly for a chemist, he crystallizes much of his academic interest to one simple question: \"If we find a sample of drug in your body, we have two important unknowns: how much did you take and when did you take it?\" </p> <p>The answer often lies within a mass spectrometer - the tool of the serious drug hunter's trade, which analyses the different chemicals in a given sample to produce a characteristic profile of peaks and spikes. The King's sports lab has banks of them, sitting side by side and quietly hunting their way through a checklist of banned drugs in dozens of samples every day. </p> <p>Some sports allow substances that others have banned (swimmers, for instance, can take some stimulants that high-board divers can't) which means that, while the testers do not know the identity of the person who supplied the sample, they are told the discipline. </p> <p>Urine to be tested arrives from the collecting officers responsible for taking it from the athletes in two identical bottles. One, the B sample, is frozen for long-term storage, while the A sample is cracked open (the lids have tamper-proof seals). Small amounts are chemically treated before the search for prohibited substances. </p> <p>\"Urine contains thousands of chemicals,\" Cowan says. \"We want to get rid of the ones we're just not interested in and concentrate on the chemicals that shouldn't be there.\" </p> <p>Up to 90% of samples breeze through the battery of tests and are declared all clear. Others require more attention. \"We see something that's allowable, but could it be hiding something that's prohibited?\" </p> <p>Such masking agents are a growing problem for anti-dopers. Some tests for the anabolic steroid testosterone, for example, rely on the fact that the supplements throw the body's chemistry out of kilter - specifically the ratio between testosterone and epitestosterone. </p> <p>Taking supplements of epitestosterone with the active steroid makes the ratio appear normal. Balco labs, the controversial site in California at the heart of the THG enquiry, has been accused of supplying a mixture of testosterone and epitestosterone, which was also produced by a pharmaceutical company in the former East Germany. </p> <p>\"Why would a pharmaceutical company make a hormone preparation of active and inactive material if not to aid the East German athletes?\" says Cowan. \"That was the state system; what we're seeing now on the US side is probably finance-driven. That one is dead easy science, but cleverly, they had the knowledge of our tests. That's one of the reasons it's better if we don't all use the same methods.\" </p> <p>Back in the lab, the suspect 10% samples are subjected to closer scrutiny. \"When it becomes a more solid suspect we go right back to the original A bottle and analyse it specifically for that substance,\" Cowan says. \"We must get two hits before we put that first report out. We're awfully careful to get it right, it's not like workplace testing where they might use a single sample.\" </p> <p>Accused athletes have the right to visit the lab to see the B sample retrieved and tested while they watch. Few do: \"We get them from time to time, sometimes with their lawyers. The big names often get their representatives to come along.\" </p> <p>About 1% of samples tested are positive - down from 2-3% when testing was introduced. \"Testing clearly helps control drug abuse in sport,\" he says. </p> <p>But to reduce it further and to tackle the problem of designer drugs like THG, Cowan believes that sweeping changes are needed to the system. </p> <p>\"The interesting thing about THG is that we couldn't have found it from urine samples alone - the concentrations are just too small. Give us a few litres and we'll identify it, but give us just 75ml and that's really pushing it.\" </p> <p>THG was only identified because traces were found in a syringe handed anonymously to the US authorities. </p> <p>Cowan says that rather than trying to find the drugs themselves, we should be watching for their knock-on effects on athletes' physiology. Testing sports stars more regularly and comparing the tests month-on-month could allow the authorities to build up a profile of normal hormone levels in each individual. \"Then if you use THG we would start to get suspicious because, if we had your profile, we would see that your androgens are suppressed.\" </p> <p>He says this system would be much harder to beat. \"I'd be able to say 'wait a minute, what's happened to you suddenly?' I think that would make the whole system a lot more powerful.\" </p> <p>It could also clear innocent athletes tainted with drug allegations. \"I don't need to know who the individual is. All I need to know is that it's from subject x rather than subject y,\" he adds. </p> <p>\"Athletes want a level playing field and they want us to do it properly. If we're not doing it properly then a number of them on the borderline are going to go to the wrong side of the rules.\" </p> <p>Despite Cowan's immersion in sport's murkier side, he says he is able to watch events without much suspicion. In fact, he takes a low-key attitude to the moral aspects of his work. \"It's more the science of it than 'yes, we've got someone',\" he says. \"When I was in Salt Lake City [for the 2002 winter games] there was a lot of excitement when we got the first darbopoetin positives.\" </p> <p>Cowan will not be drawn on how many athletes may be getting away with drug use, and how many could have narcotics to thank for the medals they will win in Athens later this month. But he is certain of one thing - they won't get away with it for ever. </p> <p>\"One of the things about cheats is that they keep cheating,\" he says. \"And we catch them in the end.\" </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance</strong></p> <p><strong>Education</strong><br>BSc, PhD in pharmacy from Chelsea College </p> <p><strong>Career</strong><br>Director of Drug Control Centre and professor of pharmaceutical toxicology, King's College London; member of the International Olympic Committee's medical commission for the 2000 Olympics. </p> <p><strong>He says</strong><br>\"If we had the means of looking at individuals rather than populations that would really help.\" </p> <p><strong>They say</strong><br>\"He's awesome - a rare combination of expertise and wisdom.\" Don Catlin, head of UCLA's Olympic testing lab.</p>",
  "<p>Top marathon runners tend to be lean and light, star swimmers are gangly things with huge feet and gold medal weightlifters are solid blocks of muscle with short arms and legs. So does your physique - and indeed the way your body works - fit you for a particular sport, or does your body develop a certain way because of your chosen sport? </p> <p>\"It's about 55:45, genes to environment,\" says Mike Rennie, professor of clinical physiology at the University of Nottingham Medical School in Derby who cites the case of identical twins from Germany, one of whom was an endurance athlete, the other a power sportsman, \"They look quite different, despite being identical twins.\" </p> <p>A five footer has little chance of becoming an elite basketball player, but being six foot nine with the springiest tendons in the land doesn't automatically propel you to Olympic gold. </p> <p>Craig Sharp, professor of sports science at Brunel University, made this point at a recent Royal Institution event at which the limits of human performance were debated. \"Unless you have tactical sense where needed, unless you have access to good equipment, medical backup and the psychological conditions to have the winning attitude and be able to drive yourself through pain, and of course, superb technique, all the physical side will be in vain.\" </p> <p>Jonathan Robinson, an applied sports scientist at the University of Bath's sports development department, underlines the importance of technique. \"In swimming, only 5-10% of the propulsive force comes from the legs, so technique is vital.\" To illustrate his point, he cites triathletes, who are all extraordinarily fit, yet who may fail to reach competition standard if their swimming technique is poor. </p> <p>But having the right physique for the right sport is a good starting point. Seventeen years ago, the Australian Institute of Sport started a national Talent Search Programme, which scoured schools for 14-16-year-olds with the potential to be elite athletes. One of their first finds was Megan Still. In 1987, she had never picked up an oar in her life. But she had almost the perfect physique for a rower. After intensive training, she won gold in women's rowing in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. </p> <p>Other countries have followed the Australian example. The explosion of genetic knowledge has meant that there is now a search, not just for sport appropriate physique but also for \"performance genes\". Several are implicated. For instance, the ability to use oxygen efficiently is key to gaining the winning edge. The EPOR gene initiates the process of red blood cell production and then switches off, but one mutation means that it carries on working, leading to an abnormal amount of red blood cells. Finnish researchers identified an entire family with this EPOR mutation, several of whom were championship endurance athletes, including the great cross-country gold medalist skier, Eero Mantyranta. This mutation was definitely performance-enhancing. Craig Sharp believes that elite athletes of the future may well come from among such physiological \"outliers\", people who naturally possess extremes of normal physiology which also happen to be performance-enhancing. \"It's a question of finding them,\" he said at the RI. </p> <p>The drive to pick elite athletes based in part on body shape or characteristics has had a difficult history, with work bedevilled by the race issue. Competitors of African origin hold most of the leading times for top running events, even though only one in eight of the world population is black. And Kenyans from the Kalenjin tribe hold 40% of the top honours for distance running. </p> <p>These Kenyan runners tend to have slim legs, with high calf muscles (a genetic trait), which is a very efficient anatomy for a runner. But, they also live above 2,000ft, which helps to increase the body's amount of red blood cells as well as its cardiovascular capacity, which are both vital for long distance running. And since runners are national heroes, and running requires no more equipment than a pair of shoes, there are considerable rewards for training intensively. </p> <p>In truth, there is more genetic variation between individuals than there is between races. All we may be seeing is encouragement for those of a similar skin colour to train hard and be the best. </p> <p>But, so far, what do we know about the different physiological types suited to particular sports? </p> <p><strong>Rowing</strong><br>The perfect male rower is an extraordinary physiological specimen. He is tall, heavy but with very low body fat (10% in men), with broad shoulders and long, powerful limbs. His heart is capable of pumping 40 litres of blood a minute. Rowers have the highest absolute maximum oxygen uptakes of any athletes and the highest intakes of air, up to 300 litres per minute. </p> <p><strong>Shooting</strong><br>You might think a sport that requires you to lie down, doesn't require fitness. But perfect shots have very good cardiovascular fitness and a low heart rate, which they can slow further. Within seconds of firing, they can (without knowing it) drop their heart rate by 20 beats and fire exactly between heatbeats. Pistol shooting also needs strong upper body musculature. </p> <p><strong>Swimming</strong><br>The perfect swimmer is tall, with very long limbs, particularly arms. Top-class swimmers have big feet, which provide a huge propulsive advantage. They have big hands to act as paddles, narrow hips to reduce drag and broad shoulders to maximise arm power. Sprint swimmers are more mesomorphic, with high power energy systems. </p> <p><strong>Sprinting</strong><br>dThe perfect 100m sprinter is tall, with a strong mesomorphic body shape. Top sprinters have slim lower legs and relatively narrow hips which gives a biomechanical advantage. They have a high percentage of fast twitch fibres (more than 80%). They use muscle fuel so fast that they are practically running on empty by the end of the race. </p> <p><strong>Marathon running</strong><br>The perfect marathon runner has a light frame, slim legs and is of small to medium height. They have high percentage of slow twitch fibres and very high maximal oxygen uptake. They can withstand dehydration, and training gives their muscles a high storage capacity for the premium muscle fuel, glycogen. </p> <p><strong>Gymnasts</strong><br>The perfect female gymnast is small and slim, with a high strength to weight ratio and an even musculature. Unusually, she will have grown steadily, rather than in spurts, during her early adolescence. She has a narrow body to permit speedy rotation and superb balance. Gymnasts of both sexes require both high power and high capacity energy systems and, overall, are the fittest of all athletes. </p> <p><strong>Weightlifting</strong><br>The perfect weightlifter has a strongly mesomorphic body type, and is very well muscled. Good weightlifters are not tall and tend to have relatively short arms and legs, which makes them more effective levers. They have cardiovascular systems able to stand sudden surges in blood pressure). High percentage of fast twitch fibres. </p> <p><strong>Morphs and muscles</strong></p> <p><strong>Body type: ectomorph, mesomorph, endomorph?</strong><br>Mesomorphs have well-defined muscles and large bones, with a low, narrow waist. Men are rectangular, and women are hourglass-shaped. Ectomorphs are skinny, lightly muscled with thin wrists and ankles. Endomorphs are round and soft, with relatively short limbs, high waists, small hands and feet. Most people are mixtures of body types, but those who are strongly mesomorphic tend to do well in sports such as weightlifting, while running is where ectomorphs are found to excel. </p> <p><strong>Body physiology: high power or high capacity?</strong><br>To determine your physiological type, it is useful to think of your muscles as being powered by batteries (in reality, they are fired by three different types of cellular fuel). Some people's muscles have a much greater capacity to deliver big bursts of power for short periods, while others are better at delivering a smaller amount of energy over a sustained period. The former group are suited to power events and the latter are better adapted to endurance sports. </p> <p><strong>Muscle composition: fast twitch/slow twitch?</strong><br>Muscles are made up of two different types of fibre. The \"fast twitch\" fibres deliver extreme amounts of power for a few seconds, whereas \"slow twitch\" fibres deliver prolonged contraction over many minutes or hours. The ratio of fast to slow fibres in each person is inherited. Those with more slow twitch fibres favour endurance events. Individuals with fast twitch fibres favour sprint events or those requiring sudden power, such as weightlifting.</p>",
  "The families and lawyers of four Britons still held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay demanded their immediate release yesterday as allegations of sustained abuse at the camp raised fresh fears for their mental and physical health. <p>Relatives of the detainees said they were frightened that the men, two of whom may have to face military trials, had made false confessions because of the way US forces had treated them. </p> <p>\"We have serious concerns about mental illness,\" said Sadiq Khan, whose law firm Christian Khan represents two Britons. \"The only people these men are going to harm is themselves.

  "Let's hope Tony Blair continues to ignore your advice to raise the top rate of income tax to 50% (Leaders, August 3).

  "Labour put proposals to give law-making powers to the Welsh assembly on the backburner yesterday but promised that the assembly would have more powers to amend laws in a third term. <p>The party also ruled out tax-raising powers for the assembly and reducing the number of Welsh MPs at Westminster. </p> <p>Announcing Labour's response to the Richard commission on the future of the assembly, Rhodri Morgan, the first minister, and Peter Hain, the Wales secretary, promised to reform the voting system which allows candidates to the 60-strong body to stand on both the first-past-the-post and the proportional top-up list systems. </p> <p>Labour's document, Better Governance for Wales, was a formal response to the Richard commission's report, published in March, which set out schemes for expanding the assembly. </p> <p>Lord Richard called for the assembly to have primary law-making powers by 2011 and for another 20 assembly members. He also said it was \"desirable, but not essential\" for it to have tax-raising powers, something Labour explicitly ruled out. </p> <p>Labour's response, which will be voted on at a special Welsh Labour conference next month, had Mr Hain and Mr Morgan agreeing that members should have a bigger role in pre-legislative scrutiny of Westminster bills. </p> <p>If Labour wins the next general election, it promises to allow the assembly more discretion in applying and amending laws. But the document is sceptical on allowing primary law-making powers, such as the Scottish parliament has, describing it merely as \"one option\". </p> <p>That option could be presented in a post-election white paper, it says, which would have to get through parliament and a referendum in Wales. But it also proposes another option which would give the assembly the same \"framework\" freedoms in devolved areas of governance but applied retrospectively. </p> <p>Although that would appear to be a compromise, yesterday one senior Labour figure said it could be harder to get through parliament than full powers. </p> <p>\"I actually think we could win a referendum, whereas this would be seen as bringing in law-making powers by the back door and would be harder to sell,\" he said.

Impressive effects, but Simon Wells fails to do justice to great-grandad HG's tale. </p> <p><strong>K-19: The Widowmaker</strong></p> <p>(Kathryn Bigelow, 2002)</p> <p>8pm, Sky Movies 2</p> <p>The story of the Soviet nuclear submarine that faced meltdown under the sea in 1961, kept quiet by the Kremlin for many years. It starts slowly, setting up the conflict between stern commander Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) and crew's champion Polenin (Liam Neeson), but once the boat hits disaster the tension builds fast. </p> <p><strong>Cruel Intentions</strong></p> <p>(Roger Kumble, 1999) 8pm, FilmFour</p> <p>Sarah Michelle Gellar, aka Buffy the Vampire Slayer, turns virginity slayer in this snappy teen updating of Les Liaisons Dangereuses. Her evil queen of the Manhattan preppies, Kathryn Merteuil, plots with Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Philippe) the seduction of untouched Miss Peaches- and-Double-Cream Reese Witherspoon, the motive being pure mischief. It's hip, sexy and fun, but despite the opulent, slightly antique style, it doesn't reach the dark heart of the story in the way that Frears and Forman managed in their adaptations. </p> <p><strong>The Wild Bunch</strong></p> <p>(Sam Peckinpah, 1969)</p> <p>10.15pm, Sky Cinema 1</p> <p>Peckinpah's masterpiece is a glorious, bloody, elegiac western: William Holden's bandit gang, lawless and out of time in Texas 1914, is drawn by the iron code of the old west into a suicidal reckoning with bad General Mapache and his army. Extremely violent - the opening and concluding massacres are delicately choreographed, slow-mo dances with death - but it is framed inside a dark moral vision, with Robert Ryan outstanding as the lawman forced to betray his old friends (craggy veterans Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oates and Ben Johnson among them). </p> <p><strong>Live Flesh</strong></p> <p>(Pedro Almod\u00f3var, 1997)</p> <p>11.15pm, Sky Cinema 2</p> <p>This twisty plot, taken from a Ruth Rendell story, is handled adroitly and lightly. It concerns young David (Javier Bardem), imprisoned for the accidental shooting of a policeman: when released, he finds the girl he loves married to the now-paraplegic cop. Almod\u00f3var has toned down the frenetic heat of his early comedies: this is an almost restrained, intimate picture of passion, jealousy and revenge, the vivid characters dignified by real emotion and motivation; and all this allied to the old Pedro's vibrant visual style. </p> <p><strong>The Mephisto Waltz</strong></p> <p>(Paul Wendkos, 1971)</p> <p>12.45am, Sky Cinema 1</p> <p>A musical Rosemary's Baby, with Alan Alda and wife Jacqueline Bisset taking a dangerous dance with diabolical concert pianist Curt Jurgens. Not that he's a bad player; he's a devil worshipper who is arranging to live on after death in Alda's body. A moody and stylish study in paranoia.</p>",
  "It is said the only politician that brought the Western Isles any luck is lying at the bottom of the sea. The grounding of the cargo ship SS Politician off Eriskay in 1941 brought an untold bounty during wartime rationing, in the form of 28,000 cases of Scotch that had been in its hold. The islanders' clandestine efforts to remove the cargo and hide it from excise officials inspired the novel by Compton Mackenzie, which was turned into the classic 1949 film Whisky Galore! <p>Now the residents of Eriskay and neighbouring Barra are celebrating plans for a remake of the old Ealing comedy, a project which could reinvigorate the local economy. </p> <p>A Glasgow-based production company, which has optioned the remake rights for the film, has launched a public investment drive to try to raise some \u00a3400,000 for pre-production. </p> <p>It is believed to be the first time such an enterprise investment scheme has been used for a film project in Scotland. If enough cash can be raised, filming could start next year, with a release date in 2006. Producer Ed Crozier said the film held a special place in the hearts of Scots. </p> <p>\"It is about ordinary people putting one over on the establishment,\" he said. \"Everybody loves that.\" </p> <p>The original film, which starred Gordon Jackson, James Robertson Justice and Basil Radford, was set on the fictional island of Todday but filmed in Barra in 1948, in what was the worst summer for almost a century. Its budget ran to \u00a380,000. The estimated budget for the remake is \u00a314m. </p> <p>Crozier said that once the funding was in place they planned to film in and around the Outer Hebrides. </p> <p>\"We are hoping to shoot it in its entirety in the Western Isles,\" he said. \"We will be filming in different places. A lot of places used in the original have street lights and electric pylons and we can't show that, of course. </p> <p>\"What we are trying to do is make this as Scottish as possible. In the original film there were a lot of home counties accents.\" </p> <p>Crozier said there had been a lot of interest from agents keen to get a new generation of Scottish stars into the film. He said he could not reveal who might be involved in the project, but one \"iconic\" English actor had been earmarked to play the part of Captain Waggett, the hapless army officer who was supposed to secure the vessel. </p> <p>The producer said he was confident a remake would appeal to an international audience in the same way that films such as Bill Forsyth's Local Hero had done. The original Whisky Galore!, under the title Whisky A Go Go, was a huge hit in France. In the US, still mindful of the prohibition era, it was titled Tight Little Island. </p> <p>\"There is a whole heritage to follow on from,\" said Crozier. \"The original was made in 1949 so there are a couple of generations who have not seen it. What we are trying to do is to emulate the powerful imagery of the original film. The first was shot in black and white and we are going to be shooting in colour. We won't lose track of the humour. It is a funny film and we will be introducing that subtle island humour to an international market.\" </p> <p>Donald Manford, the Western Isles councillor for Barra, said the islanders were excited about the possibility of a remake. </p> <p>But Mr Manford has more reason than many to be interested in the project. His grandfather was arrested, spent a night in jail, and had to walk 50 miles to a court hearing for trying to salvage some of the hundreds of thousands of bottles of whisky that had been on board when the cargo ship ran aground on February 5 in gale force winds en route from Liverpool to Jamaica and on to New Orleans. </p> <p>\"I'm hugely supportive of the project and I wish them every success,\" said Mr Manford. \"I think the reaction across the island will be extremely positive. The only kind of concern that I have heard mooted is that a new film might take away from the original film. But I don't accept that argument at all because the film itself was a story and this will be another story.\" </p> <p>Mr Manford said the project, if it went ahead, could provide a shot in the arm to the local tourist economy. Visitors attracted to Scotland by films they had seen accounted for between \u00a315m and \u00a320m of tourist revenue every year. </p> <p>\"It adds to the spice,\" said Mr Manford. \"It adds to the interest. It adds to the folklore.\"</p>",
  "In a move seen as marking the end of more than a decade of civil war between Islamists and the military in Algeria, the country's army chief, General Mohammed Lamari, has stood down. <p>He blamed ill health for retiring at the age of 65, but many see political reasons for the retreat of a leading member of the group of generals who hijacked power to prevent Islamists taking charge after election victories in the early 90s. </p> <p>A guerrilla war in which 120,000 people were killed followed, with the army accused of being involved in atrocities as it fought Islamists who, in turn, massacred civilians. </p> <p>The portly Gen Lamari, his eyes hidden by sunglasses, had for the past decade been the leading figure among the so-called pouvoir or decideurs, the men who ran the country and, in effect, appointed its presidents. </p> <p>But he surprised many by insisting the army stand back at the presidential elections in April, despite his differences with the man who was re-elected and who looks to have taken control, Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Gen Lamari disagreed with President Bouteflika's attempt to persuade Islamists to give up armed struggle in exchange for a place in politics. \"The time has come for the military to ... go back to barracks,\" El Watan newspaper said yesterday.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> Just when our gnat-like attention span was waning, a second top source has leapt from the woodwork to assist us in unmasking the Sunday Telegraph's bashful Islamophobe columnist, \"Will Cummins\". Will, you'll recall, has been wowing readers of the paper for weeks with frequent comparisons of Islam with Nazism, and such gems as \"all Muslims, like dogs, share the same characteristics\". Strong words, and in light of them we were ever so slightly taken aback to be assured that Will was in fact Harry Cummins, a senior press officer for the British Council. Harry hotly denies the claims, but is now on fully-paid suspension while the British Council investigates. We call communications chief Christopher Wade to check on progress. \"Yes?\" he sighs. The investigation does seem to be dragging a bit, we say. So we'd like to state that Harry is author of the pieces, and if he disagrees perhaps he'd care to invite us down the Strand to discuss it more formally? \"Why would he want to do that?\" We rather think he wouldn't, but anything to get Columbo - or whoever you've got on the case - off his backside. <p><b>\u00b7</b> Yet with Harry on paid suspension, fans of his work will be feeling the drought. We oblige by printing an extract from a press release he crafted last August, concerning a British Council event inviting the media \"to debate press freedom and responsibilities with emerging and potential Muslim leaders\". It was, we learn from Harry's summary, part of the British Council's programme aiming to build \"deeper mutual understanding, learning and respect between young people from different cultural backgrounds\". A theme poignantly echoed in Will Cummins's July 25 Sunday Telegraph effort, headlined: Muslims Are A Threat To Our Way Of Life. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Quote of the day comes from the Guant\u00e1namo Bay interrogator who, while interviewing British detainee Shafiq Rasul, showed a quite dazzling grasp of local knowledge. \"If I wanted to get surface-to-air missiles from someone in Tipton,\" he demanded, \"who would I go to?\" Well, it's a little out of town ... but has he not heard of the Merry Hill shopping centre? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Martin Baccardax takes issue with a facetious remark we made yesterday suggesting Condoleezza Rice hadn't heard of al-Qaida when she took office. \"Rice gave an interview to Detroit's WJR ... in October 2000, specifically detailing both Osama bin Laden's terrorist activities and those of his al-Qaida brethren,\" he writes. \"If you're going to try and be cute, it helps if you're actually right.\" Punchy, Mart - but cool your boots. Condoleezza did talk to the station in October 2000. \"We don't want to wake up one day,\" she said, \"and find out that Osama bin Laden has been successful on our own territory.\" Indeed. She made no mention of al-Qaida, which may account for former White House counter-terrorism chief Richard Clarke's claim that, following his own briefing to her on the organisation shortly after she took office, the national security adviser's facial expression suggested \"she had never heard the term before\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Unfortunately, this is not enough for Martin, who informs us he is making a formal complaint to both the editor and the Press Complaints Commission over our gross libel of Condi. \"You've got a big problem,\" he warns. Clearly. Maybe it would feel worse without the Xanax. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Agonisingly, we must retract last week's Surveillance of Jonathon Porritt, Prince Charles's environmental guru, buying non-organic fruit in Richmond Sainsbury's two Saturdays ago. Jonathon has had his people call us to say it was not him. As for the Porrittalike - seen purchasing avocados and cherries - if his people would like to get in touch we'd be more than happy to offer a similarly prominent apology.</p>",
  "Britain's leading expert on doping in sport has called for sweeping changes to the way athletes are screened for performance-enhancing drugs. <p>Professor David Cowan, head of the drug control centre at King's College London, where most of the British Olympic team have been tested ahead of the games, says the introduction of such \"undetectable\" designer steroids as THG and the prospect of athletes abusing genetic techniques means the current system cannot be relied on to catch the cheats. </p> <p>Speaking before the Athens Olympics, the build-up to which has been dominated by a succession of high-profile drug scandals in the United States, Prof Cowan said sports stars should be tested each month so that scientists can develop a profile of their normal levels of hormones and other body chemicals and watch for suspicious changes caused by drug use. </p> <p>\"That's definitely the way to go - looking for the effects of a drug rather than the drug itself,\" Prof Cowan said. </p> <p>\"It would vastly improve the fight against designer drugs and things beating the system. Athletes want a level playing field and they want us to do it properly. If we're not doing it properly then a number of them on the borderline are going to go to the wrong side of the rules.\" </p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Prof Cowan said monitoring hormone levels in this way would have caught athletes who had taken THG much earlier, including the British sprinter Dwain Chambers. </p> <p>The so-called designer drug is an anabolic steroid similar to testosterone modified to slip past standard tests, which search urine for signature products the drugs produce after they break down in the body. </p> <p>Because THG was an unknown substance, tests used at the time were not primed to find it - it was only detected after traces were found in a syringe handed anonymously to the US authorities. </p> <p>Once they knew what they were looking for, scientists at the University of California quickly developed a test for THG. But they and the US Anti-Doping Agency warned earlier this week that some competitors in Athens will be using other, as yet unknown, designer drugs. </p> <p>Prof Cowan said regular profiling offered a solution: \"It would be less easy to beat. If you use something like testosterone, it will have the effect of suppressing your natural hormones. I'd be able to say 'wait a minute what's happened to you?' and then start homing in on that sample.\" </p> <p>Profiling could also provide an early warning of sports stars using medical gene therapy techniques. According to US scientists developing them to treat patients, several athletes have already asked about having their DNA rewritten to boost physique and stamina. </p> <p>Inserted genes would produce performance-enhancing hormones indistinguishable from the body's natural supply, making them difficult to trace. \"If we're monitoring an individual and see a sudden change, then that's one way to detect it,\" Prof Cowan said. \"I think the more we talk about this, the more it will become clear it is the way to go.\" </p> <p>Michele Verroken, the former head of anti-doping for UK Sport, said: \"A lot would depend on how regularly you tested the athletes and that brings you into the cat-and-mouse game you play in terms of the testing programme.\" </p> <p>She said unofficial monitoring of profiles had already taken place when anti-dopers became suspicious of certain individuals. \"There were times when I gave him [Prof Cowan] a series of sample numbers and said can you have a look at that range together.\" </p> <p>Guin Batten, who won a rowing silver medal at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, said athletes would not mind being tested more regularly. \"I think most athletes would bend over backwards to make sure their sport was clean,\" she said. \"If this is the only way, then I think we have no option.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for UK Sport said: \"We are always looking at ways of improving all aspects of the anti-doping programme to ensure an athlete's right to compete in drug-free sport is maintained. </p> <p>\"Clearly this system of regular screening could help, although the practical and financial implications need to be considered carefully to see whether it is a truly viable option.\"</p>",
  "<p>Laura Spence, the straight-A state-school pupil who was denied a place at Oxford University in 2000, today stepped back into the political fray with an appeal to British students to consider taking their degree in America. </p> <p>Since Ms Spence found herself at the centre of a row over Oxford admissions four years ago, she has gained a degree in biochemistry from Harvard. </p> <p>Now she is urging sixth-formers to consider a US university education over a British one, as her experience has made her \"substantially more well-rounded, confident and better prepared to make contributions to medicine,\" she said.</p> <p>Ms Spence said that she had to work harder than the American students to stay on top of coursework and essays, but the results were worth it: American degrees are \"broader\" than British ones and campus life offered an \"astounding\" range of extra-curricular activities, she said. </p> <p>Four years ago, the then 18-year old from Tyneside was at the heart of a political row over Oxford's admissions procedures, after she failed to secure a place to study medicine despite getting five As for her A-levels. </p> <p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, stepped in, accusing Oxford admissions tutors of \"old school tie\" elitism against pupils from state schools, and labelled Magdalen College's decision an \"absolute scandal\".</p> <p>Ms Spence responded by turning her back on the British system and securing a $65,000 (\u00a335,000) scholarship to study biochemistry at Harvard in Massachusetts, from where she has now graduated with \"above average\" results. </p> <p>In an interview in today's Times Higher Education Supplement, Ms Spence said: \"The US-style 'liberal arts' education requires that each student learns a broader, more balanced curriculum whilst still achieving depth in their specialist subject. </p> <p>\"Unlike the more focused, professionally oriented UK degrees, this style of education is particularly suitable for students who don't want to limit themselves to specific career paths straight out of high school.\" </p> <p>She urged other students not to be put off by the cost of studying in America. \"While at first glance, tuition fees may seem astronomically prohibitive - $37,000 (\u00a320,000) a year at Harvard - there are many forms of financial aid available.</p> <p>\"At Harvard, financial aid is needs-based, so if the admissions office wants to offer you a place, the financial aid office makes sure you have sufficient support through grants, loans and part-time jobs.\"</p> <p>With the British government planning higher fees for students, the option of study in America could become even more desirable, she added. </p> <p>Describing her transition from the British state school system to an American ivy league university, she said: \"The style of education at Harvard was more of an adjustment for me than for American students.\" </p> <p>Ms Spence had to take extra courses to catch up in maths and foreign languages because she did not have an A-level qualification in those subjects.</p> <p>\"With many hours of scheduled classes, multiple homework sets and essays each week, I felt substantially more overworked than I had done at A-level. </p> <p>\"Many students from competitive American high schools thought the Harvard workload was quite relaxed.\"</p> <p>Despite this situation, Ms Spence engaged in an \"astounding\" range of extracurricular activities. </p> <p>\"A substantial proportion of college learning takes place in these social experiences and challenges outside the classroom - from pre-law societies and volunteer organisations to rowing teams and orchestras.\"</p> <p>Ms Spence has now returned to the UK to take a postgraduate course in medicine with the aim of achieving her original ambition to become a doctor. </p> <p>However, she refused to reveal which university she was planning to attend. </p> <p>Oxford University does offer a postgraduate degree in medicine but a spokesperson said that they would not comment on individual students.</p> <p>A total of 8,000 British students opt to study in America every year, though numbers have dipped slightly with the introduction of the tougher visa application process since 2001.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q</strong> My grandmother is in a nursing home and a few years ago, acting with power of attorney, my sister and I took out a Scottish Mutual with profits bond (\u00a3100,000) amongst other products, as an investment vehicle to give her a monthly income for meeting the costs of her nursing care. The financial advisors who recommended the product did inform my sister regarding the surrender penalties / consequences of exiting the Scottish Mutual policy but did not state the potential sting of the market value adjuster (MVA) penalties, which have been very high. The MVA penalties have been reduced recently but it still means we are locked into a poor situation. Is there any potential redress for this situation? We have been advised to withdraw money (a maximum of \u00a37,000 pa) from the fund without incurring MVA penalties and reinvest - but this is a limp way of reducing the amount invested. I feel rather angry and misinformed - I would have expected this product to be a low risk investment and feel we have mismanaged our grandmother's assets through not fault of our own. Have we a case to bring against the IFAs? </p> <p><strong>RB</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Regretfully I think you would have a hard job in making a case against the financial advisers. They would point out that details of a potential MVA were contained in the literature and terms of the bond and you were specifically warned about the surrender penalties even though I am sure it was sold to you as a low risk investment. Very few people predicted the sustained fall in the market that has triggered off these horrendous MVAs. . Nevertheless it would cost you nothing to make a complaint to the advisers and see what reaction you get. At the same time you could check whether the bond has an MVA free maturement date. Quite a lot of the Scottish Mutual with-profit bonds included a provision to surrender the policy, without being liable to pay an MVA, on the 10th anniversary from the starting date. </p>"
