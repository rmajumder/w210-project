  "<p><strong> Dave Calhoun: </strong> At what stage did you begin to decide that you wanted to move [from making commercials] into making a feature film? </p> <p><strong>Jonathan Glazer:</strong> I was sent a screenplay of Gangster No 1, which was a very different story from the one that was eventually made. And the writing was extraordinary. That was it for me. So I went after that, and I was lucky enough that the writers wanted me to do it, and we started work. But it never happened as a result of a casting problem with the producer, and we didn't do it because we didn't want to miscast it. They had a number of other projects and the one they wanted to do more than anything was Sexy Beast. I read in a magazine that they \"encouraged\" me to do Sexy Beast; they didn't do any such thing. There was never an option. As soon as they put it in front of me, I was going to do it. It was just dynamite writing again. It was the quality of the writing - that was it, I was going to make a film. </p> <p><strong>DC:</strong> Some of your later commercials, like the Guinness surfer ad, are very ambitious projects. Was the surfer ad by far the most daring thing you'd tried to pull off up to that point? </p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Hard to say. Technically, definitely, because you're putting together two elements which have no reason to belong with one another- the horses and water - and to have them become the same thing was just ... It was very, very difficult to put together, but at the same time, you have to shoot it quite free-form. The horses were done very specifically, though. We had the advantage of shooting the surfing footage, cutting that and finding the shape of the piece, and then shooting the horses very specifically to those pictures, to make sure that the computer graphics people got the exact angle they needed and so on. It was definitely a big job. </p> <p><strong>DC:</strong> You say it was incredibly controlled, but how much were you reliant on natural conditions - for example, the waves down there in Hawaii? </p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> You end up running from one side of the island to the next because there are waves. You're told, \"They'll be landing at this beach, they'll be at least 15ft high\" - and then it's just a paddling pool. And then you have to run over to the other side of the island. We were shooting there for two and a half weeks and, some days, you'd get two shots. A couple of friends of mine surf, and to them, to be around Rusty Keaulana, the surfer, was exciting in itself. And to see the waves come down like buildings, that was quite something. It was a very difficult job to film because everything's moving. </p> <p><strong>DC:</strong> When you're making a piece like that, which is so reliant for its success on the post-production phase, are you 100% confident that you're going to pull it off? </p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> You're never 100% confident you're ever going to pull anything off. You only get there by the skin of your teeth each time. That was no different at all. The horses only really started to look like they made sense to those pictures very late on in the post-production process, but that's always the way. And there were conversations going on behind the scenes along the lines of, \"Why don't we just dump the horses? The ad's fine on its own.\" </p> <p><strong>DC:</strong> On Sexy Beast, how did you find the transition from shooting promos and commercials? Did you have any worries about having to work with actors? </p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Very much so. It's a whole different deal and it's such a dialogue-intensive film. For that reason, I think it was the perfect baptism for me. I had the perfect map: you could trust the writing so completely and the actors realised early on that you had to stay with the rhythms of what was written and they couldn't improvise. And if it said \"cough\", it meant cough. If you give an actor a good scene to do, they're happy. It was just about ramping them up all the time. </p> <p><strong>DC:</strong> Sexy Beast was very successful in the States, which, in a way, was quite surprising for such a British film. Were you surprised? </p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Yeah, I was. To be honest, I didn't think the Americans were going to understand too much of it. I thought they'd have to strain their ear because they're not tuned in to that, but maybe they liked it because it was a bit exotic or something. </p> <p><strong>DC:</strong> Sexy Beast was made at a time when we'd just had Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and that was spawning several similar British gangster films. How did you feel about that genre at the time? </p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Well, Gangster No 1, which I was supposed to make, was ahead of all that. Then with the amount of time we spent trying to get Gangster No 1 to the screen and subsequently making Sexy Beast, we were overtaken by a series of films that were gangster-genre films. You can't worry about that. You've just got to do your own thing. A lot of people worried about it - the distributors of the film, for instance. I don't think it was very well distributed, partly because there had been such a glut of gangster films. They were scared of getting burned by another one. And it wasn't just them - I think some of the cinema chains didn't want to take it either. They didn't believe in it, or they didn't trust it. </p> <p><strong>DC:</strong> Birth had its world premiere at the Venice film festival at the beginning of September. Tell us a little about its gestation. </p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> I had the idea for it before I made Sexy Beast. I just liked it - I thought it was strong and I couldn't stop thinking about it. And it manifested itself quite differently at different periods. I worked with two writers on it - one was Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re, who wrote Bu\u00f1uel's French films and Tin Drum and The Return of Martin Guerre and some amazing cinema. I took him a paragraph and he made a story out of it and we sat and discussed it. I was just encouraged by working with someone like him, and how the idea must have legs for him to want to invest his time in it. But it was a really difficult piece to make, and I think that was what attracted me to it, how knife-edge it was. </p> <p>And I worked for a long period of time with Milo Addica, who is second writer. We worked during the shooting of the film - we were writing as we were shooting. But it was something I felt like I had to make, and I just thought, now or never, really. </p> <p><strong>DC:</strong> We should give some idea of the story. Nicole Kidman plays a woman who, at the beginning of the film, is celebrating her engagement, having lost her first husband 10 years beforehand. And after that engagement party, a 10-year-old boy called Sean turns up claiming to be her dead husband. And that's the premise of the film. It ended up causing a press furore in Venice - not to do with the film but to do with Lauren Bacall saying certain things about Nicole Kidman at a press conference. How did it feel for you to be caught up in a situation like that? </p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> It is what it looks like - it's a circus. I kind of knew when I got Nicole Kidman to do the film that it would happen. When you're working with actors like her and Lauren Bacall ... it's amazing for me to be doing that, but at the same time, it's either a good take or a bad take. They're good enough actors to know that's the case. If it's a bad take, you do it again; if it's a good take, you move on. But when the work is over and you see that whole circus begin, then it's a different story altogether. You're lucky enough if you can close the door and walk away, but someone like Nicole has to live in that. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Birth is released on November 5.</p>",
  "Suppose the government of France were to debate an anti-terrorism law which said that any British citizen entering France might be arrested on the word of the French minister of the interior, and held at his pleasure without the possibility of judicial review. <p>Even the most swivel-eyed Europhobe might not believe this would actually happen, but it would make a wonderful scare story.</p> <p>Then suppose that the new law was discovered to have another provision: that the Brits arrested under this law might legally be shipped to Algeria for torture at the minister's discretion.</p> <p>The wording would be something like this (I translate): the minister -</p> <p>\"shall revise the regulations prescribed ... to implement the United Nations convention against torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;</p> <p>and</p> <p>\"the revision shall exclude from the protection of such regulations aliens ...including rendering such aliens ineligible for withholding or deferral of removal under the convention.\"</p> <p>This law - let's move into the realms of paranoid fantasy here - would apply retrospectively, so that anyone whom Nicolas Sarkozy had wanted to torture at any time in the last ten or 15 years could now be shipped off to any country with sufficiently advanced torture chambers (whether or not they came from there in the first place). </p> <p>In a final touch of Gallic logic, it would explain that that \"the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish by clear and convincing proof that he or she might be tortured.\"</p> <p>Of course, this couldn't happen; and if it ever did, there would be an outcry in the British press that an EU country was behaving so barbarously. The Turks are being pressured to outlaw torture in their country, and they aren't even EU members.</p> <p>The moral of this little story is that we hold Turkey, and Turkish law enforcement, to higher standards than the USA. Because the bill I quoted isn't fantasy. It has been introduced into the House of Representatives by the Republican leadership and may well be passed there on Thursday. It is contained in Sections 3031 and 3032 of \"HR 10\", the big and largely uncontroversial bill giving effect to the recommendations of the 9/11 commission: the obnoxious sections start at around page 210 of a 542 page document.</p> <p>It is the concealment which suggests there is some scrap of shame left in the Republican party. The bill is sponsored by several at the top of the party - among them Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House of Representatives - but they cannot be certain that it would get through if it were openly debated. It's possible that a growing public reaction will kill this section of the bill, though one should not underestimate the determination of some sections of the American security apparatus to use torture as a matter of routine.</p> <p>For American voters, the answer is simple enough. They can write to their representatives; they can vote; they can raise a fuss. We appreciate their altruistic efforts - and they are, I think, altruistic: at this stage, discretionary torture is a treatment reserved for foreigners.</p> <p>The question that interests me, however, is what a British voter can do. Last year. David Blunkett signed an extradition treaty which removes the ability of British courts to test American evidence. If the Americans want to extradite a British citizen, they need only prove he is who they say he is. Once their new law passes it will be entirely legal for them to ship their British victims off to Syria for torture without trial.</p> <p>In other words, the British government, whose first duty is to ensure the safety of British citizens and their fundamental human rights, can no longer guarantee that we can't be tortured, or that it won't hand us over to another government which will torture us.</p> <p>To ask your government to protect you from torture would seem a fairly modest claim; so far as I know it has been accepted in British law that government shouldn't torture people since around 1680. Obviously, it can be overridden by force majeur. We expect our government to protest about the treatment of the detainees in Guantanamo, but not to mount an SAS mission to rescue them.</p> <p>But to sign a treaty of extradition with a country that practices torture is another matter. It is quite simply monstrous. It isn't what was meant to happen when Mr Blunkett signed the treaty last year. I'll believe this government is wrong about a lot of things, but not that it would knowingly embrace systematic torture as a means of state policy.</p> <p>But that is what the new American bill would legalise; and this is the sort of surprise that you get when you set off down a slippery slope. </p> <p>For the first time in my life, I begin to understand the rage of the Europhobes, when they contemplate their ancient liberties destroyed by a superstate without a chance to vote against the process. But I can't help feeling that the right to straight, unbroken legs is more important than the right to bendy bananas. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Andrew Brown, whose column appears on Mondays, is the author of The Darwin Wars: The Scientific War for the Soul of Man and In the Beginning Was the Worm: Finding the Secrets of Life in a Tiny Hermaphrodite.

  "The Basque terrorist group Eta suffered its biggest setback for a dozen years yesterday when the French police seized its political leader and significant amounts of firearms and explosives in a series of raids. <p>Mikel Albizu, Eta's suspected leader, and Soledad Iparraguirre, said to be its most senior woman, were among 21 arrested. They were carrying false papers and refused to answer questions but were identified by police agents and, the Spanish interior ministry said, by their fingerprints. </p> <p>\"It is a very important operation ... Seven homes have been searched and police have seized large quantities of documentation, weapons and explosives,\" the minister, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alonso, said. </p> <p>Rocket launchers, rifles, munitions and explosives were reportedly found in villages and farmhouses between Pau and Bayonne in south-west France. </p> <p>Forty-two machine pistols were said to have been discovered at one spot and quantities of Eta's favourite explosive, Titadyne, were also found. </p> <p>\"All of those houses are in rural locations which are difficult to access ... We expect to find a substantial amount of weapons and explosives,\" the ministry statement said. </p> <p>Mr Albizu, 43, has been on the run since 1985, when he organised the escape of two senior Eta prisoners from a Spanish jail, sneaking them out in a van used to move musical equipment after a concert. </p> <p>A part-time theatre critic and writer before turning to terrorism, he is believed to have risen to the top of the group in 1992 after the French police captured almost the entire leadership at a farmhouse in Bidart, south-west France. </p> <p>Since then Mr Albizu, more commonly known by his alias Mikel Antza, has reportedly overseen the group's strategy, financing and arms-buying. Leadership of its \"military operations\" has passed through several pairs of hands as arrests have reduced its ability to organise itself and carry out attacks. </p> <p>Spain has enjoyed 16 months without an Eta killing, the quietest period, barring truces, since the early 70s. </p> <p>It planted bombs in tourist towns in northern Spain this summer but they caused no significant damage or injuries. </p> <p>In recent weeks it has been blamed for the blowing up of two electricity pylons in northern Spain, and Spanish police said yesterday that they had also arrested a man - a truck driver based in France - they believed to be responsible. </p> <p>Five more suspected Eta members, allegedly responsible for providing safe houses for activists arriving from the group's hiding places in France, had been picked up in the Basque country a few days earlier. </p> <p>Ms Iparraguirre, alias An boto, is believed to have risen higher in Eta's command structure than any other woman, running part of its \"commando units\" for a period before she had a child with Mr Albizu. </p> <p>She is wanted in Spain for the murder of 15 people in bombings and machine gun attacks in the northern Basque country and in Madrid. </p> <p>Described by Spanish newspapers as \"elegant\" and \"deadly\", she took her alias from a mountain that, accord ing to legend, is home to an ancient Basque goddess capable of transforming herself into fire. </p> <p>Spain will seek her extradition on murder charges, and Mr Albizu is expected to be jailed in in France, the Spanish media reported. </p> <p>The identities of the other 19 people were not known last night but they they were said to include Spanish and French nationals.</p>",
  "The weekend battles in Samarra are likely to prove only a foretaste of what will follow in Iraq if and when George Bush has secured re-election. Once casualties become less politically embarrassing, he will launch American troops on an intensified offensive to crush the insurgency in advance of the January elections. <p>The most plausible scenario is that the poll will take place as scheduled, but turnout will be so low that the result will lack credibility. None the less, in early spring Washington and London will attempt to wind down the coalition's military role and transfer security responsibilities to Iraqis. This policy will fail, I think, because the new national guard will prove ineffectual.</p> <p>Thereafter matters will become much messier, the outcome hard to foresee. Tony Blair told the Labour conference last week that Britain should stick it out in Iraq \"until the job is done\". If he really meant what he said, our troops would be there for a decade. The black hole in Blair's remarks is that he did not address what happens if, as seems overwhelmingly likely, the Iraqi people will not tolerate the coalition's presence for a tithe of that time.</p> <p>Next year, a growing body of non-violent Iraqis will press for the withdrawal of the \"foreign occupiers\". Their demands could well become irresistible. It is implausible that, without allied firepower, either new Iraqi institutions or security forces will be strong enough to sustain the country's political integrity.</p> <p>Visiting Iraq in September with General Sir Mike Jackson, the chief of the general staff, I found most British assessments of the political and military prospects hard-headed and realistic - not least the scepticism about US tactics and their frightful impact upon civilians.</p> <p>I sat up sharply, however, in the midst of one briefing. After January's elections, allied forces are set to pull back rapidly from responsibility for combating insurgency. The big HQ at Allenby Lines, outside Basra, will be abandoned as the British withdraw to their logistics base at Shaiba, 10 miles out in the desert. Only a single brigade of British combat troops is scheduled to remain in country, to provide arms-length support for Iraqi forces.</p> <p>I asked a senior British officer if it seems plausible that the troops of the Allawi interim government can provide effective security when the best of the US and British armies are experiencing such difficulties. He responded brightly that the national guard will be operating in a much less violent environment, since most insurgents are motivated by hostility to the \"foreign occupiers\".</p> <p>This seems a very doubtful proposition. The insurgents proclaim daily their hatred for the interim government and its agents. There is little reason to suppose that elections will strengthen the regime's legitimacy. \"There is a big job of public education to be done before the elections, and it can't be done by us,\" a British military adviser told me. Soldiers, however sensitive to \"hearts and minds\", cannot run political tutorials for millions of voters. Endemic violence makes it dangerous for British and American troops to communicate with the local population.</p> <p>Political education depends on Ayad Allawi's government, whose interior ministry is notoriously inadequate. Among the citizens of Basra, impatience with the regime is becoming dangerously passionate. There is a widespread belief that the Shia population of the south is being neglected by Baghdad.</p> <p>As long as coalition troops are contesting insurgency, no one can address routine law and order. The consequence is that in most of the country Iraqis suffer as much from non-political crime, especially kidnapping, as terrorism. This is why people find it so hard to perceive the benefits of the coalition presence.</p> <p>It is a chronic weakness of western interventions that civil follow-up to military action is inadequate or non-existent. It remains so in the Balkans and Afghanistan. US and British troops in Iraq face no danger of battlefield defeat. The insurgents have been overwhelmingly successful, however, in frustrating even such half-baked reconstruction efforts as the Pentagon has attempted.</p> <p>The catalogue of Washington's follies and lies is so extensive it is hard to know which to highlight first, but let us try. George Bush - and Tony Blair - persists in relating events in Iraq to al-Qaida and the war on terror, which is drivel unsupported by a shred of credible intelligence.</p> <p>American strategy continues to focus on the exploitation of force to suppress armed resistance. Of course, it is hard to pursue political objectives when coalition troops have their hands full dealing with suicide bombs, kidnappings and ambushes. But failure in Iraq seems certain, unless Bush, Blair and Allawi can create civil structures while containing violence, and provide Iraqis with evidence that their lives are getting better.</p> <p>In Iraq today, the vast majority of the population is standing aloof, awaiting events. Iraqis are understandably unwilling to commit themselves to the regime when it seems likely that Allawi will forfeit power sooner or later, and that coalition troops will leave.</p> <p>After hearing an eager British officer holding forth on the progress of his efforts at a police training school, I asked an impassive Iraqi colonel what he made of it all. He intoned mechanically: \"I merely want to serve my country in any way I can\" - much as he might have said \"God is great\".</p> <p>Who can blame such a man, who has lived through 40 years of his society's turbulent history, for a reluctance to display commitment? And who can readily believe that several hundred thousand like him, who have accepted employment from the Allawi regime merely to earn a crust in desperate circumstances, will be capable of securing their country in six months?</p> <p>Most British diplomats and commanders display a wise humility about the future, partly founded on the paucity of intelligence. A political adviser told me: \"I find it impossible to read what is going to happen. These people have lived in difficulties, thrown back on their wits, for so long. Iraqis don't understand their own interests, or democracy, or how to exploit a situation to their advantage.\"</p> <p>It is perhaps impossible to teach a nation these things in a matter of months, but someone has to try. Whatever the difficulties of elections in January, better an unconvincing poll than no poll. Rationally, those who argue that the coalition forces should withdraw have a case. It is hard to be optimistic about what will happen if they stay.</p> <p>Yet allied troops must surely remain through 2005 to support some edifice of government, however rickety. Simply to quit would be as shocking an act of irresponsibility as was the original invasion without postwar planning. Bloody anarchy may overtake Iraq anyway. It will assuredly do so if coalition troops depart prematurely. In this, at least, Blair seems right. Unfortunately, neither he nor the Iraqi people may yet have felt the depths of George Bush's capacity for folly and the abuse of force.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Max Hastings is former editor of the London Evening Standard and the Daily Telegraph</p>",
  "The government of Charles de Gaulle held hundreds of foreigners, including at least three Britons, in an internment camp near Toulouse for up to four years after the second world war, according to secret documents. <p>The papers, part of a cache of 12,000 photocopied illegally by an Austrian-born Jew, reveal the extent to which French officials collaborated with their fleeing Nazi occupiers even as their country was being liberated. They also show that, when the war was over, France went to extraordinary lengths to hide as much evidence of that collaboration as possible. </p> <p>The documents are in a mass of registers, telegrams and manifests which Kurt Werner Schaechter, an 84-year-old retired businessman, copied from the Toulouse office of France's national archives in 1991. They are uniquely precious: under a 1979 law most of France's wartime archives are sealed for between 60 and 150 years after they were written. </p> <p>\"This is an untold story of the dark side of France's liberation 60 years ago,\" Mr Schaechter, a former musical instruments salesman, said at his home in Alfortville, a Paris suburb. \"French functionaries were involved in a national scandal that continued until 1949: the despicable treatment of allied and neutral civilians interned during the war.\" </p> <p>Mr Schaechter's activities - last year he used some of the papers to try to force the French railway SNCF to admit its responsibility in shipping 76,000 Jews to Nazi death camps - have infuriated some French historians, who say their privileged access to classified archives has been compromised. But others have backed the campaign for freer access to documents relating to a part of France's past that it has long preferred to ignore. </p> <p>By far the most awkward of his recently unearthed documents are those that appear to show that No\u00e9 camp, 25 miles south of Toulouse, continued to function secretly for several years after the war. No\u00e9 was one of 300 camps set up after 1939 to hold Jews, communists and other \"anti-French\" militants, Gypsies, common criminals and enemy aliens. </p> <p>Many of its inmates were quickly shipped out as France was progressively liberated in the summer of 1944. But, said Mr Schaechter, not everyone could be got out in time: \"Allied bombing of the railway lines, and intensified fighting on the ground, meant many simply could not be moved.\" </p> <p>Officially, the only camps still open after 1945 were a handful housing Romanies, stateless persons and French collaborators. But Mr Schaechter says his documents indicate that a \"special section\" of No\u00e9 was active until at least 1947. </p> <p>Among the papers is a letter dated February 23 1946 from the camp's director to the prefect in Toulouse. It seeks to \"draw urgent attention\" to No\u00e9's \"increasingly delicate financial situation\", adding that sums seized from those \"sheltered\" in the camp \"are no longer adequate to meet the costs of maintaining it, or of feeding [the inmates]\". The camp's accounts show that inmates were still being forced to pay for their \"lodging\" in September 1947. </p> <p>There are also letters between the interior ministry's inspectorate of internment camps and the prefecture querying the number of \"administrative internees\" held in the d\u00e9partement's camps. They are dated March 5 and March 29 1949 - three years after the last internment camp in mainland France was officially closed. </p> <p>Photocopies of the camp's registers from 1945, 1946 and 1947 show that No\u00e9's postwar inmates, along with citizens of Switzerland, Sweden, Holland, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Brazil, included three Britons: Abdul Hussan, born in 1901 in Port Louis, Mauritius; Leonard Wynne, born in London in 1891; and Alfred Smith, born in Manchester in 1888. </p> <p>Mr Schaechter believes they were not released at the end of the war because it would have been too embarrassing. </p> <p>\"The last thing De Gaulle wanted, when he was trying to build up France's image as victor and hero,\" he said, \"was to reveal the true extent of its collaboration by freeing neutral and allied internees held in French camps by French guards.\" </p> <p>The papers also show that officials continued to deport inmates of all nationalities to a near-certain death in Germany even as France was being liberated. </p> <p>A neat register shows that, in March 1944, No\u00e9 contained inmates of 25 nationalities, including three Americans and 13 Britons aged between 21 and 55, and one other Briton aged over 55. </p> <p>On June 24 1944, two weeks after the allies landed on the beaches of Normandy, the camp commandant wrote to the Toulouse prefecture. \"I have the honour to inform you,\" he said, \"that on the 22nd of this month nine British citizens were transferred to this camp.\" Their names include William Rogerson, born in Manchester in 1874; Edward Josephs, London, 1898; and Walter Slack, Hull, 1891. </p> <p>On June 26 the commandant informed the prefecture that he had four American \"guests\": Moore Sumner Kirby, born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in 1895; Herbert Lespinasse, Stamford, 1884; Gerald McLanghin, Detroit, 1898; and James Smith, Los Angeles, 1904. </p> <p>Some of these Britons and Americans \"regrouped\" in No\u00e9 on the eve of the liberation were wealthy residents of the C\u00f4te d'Azur; Sumner Kirby had married Leonida, Princess Bagration-Muhranskaja - later the wife of Vladimir, a grand duke of the Romanovs - in Nice in 1934. Others, such as Joseph Edwards and Thomas Berridge, were farmers or agricultural labourers. </p> <p>Many, without doubt, were on the last transport of aliens to leave No\u00e9-Longages station on July 30 1944. This \"transfer\" is referred to in a telegram from the camp commandant on August 28 - two days after a million cheering French men and women thronged the Champs-Elys\u00e9es in Paris for Charles de Gaulle's victory parade. Mr Schaechter believes most of them ended up in Dachau; Sumner Kirby is known to have died in the Leau concentration camp near Bernberg, Germany, on April 7 1945. </p> <p>But what happened to those, many elderly and infirm, who stayed? Some are marked \"transferred\". Others were moved in 1947 to Pithiviers or Rivesaltes camps, both officially closed. Some are marked: \"Agreed with Mr Casse - to be lost\". And what that means, no one knows.</p>",
  "From the outside, the local community association on the west side of Chicago doesn't look much. The only sign on the shabby one-storey building is a piece of paper stuffed inside a clear plastic jacket on the front door. The building was supposed to be a temporary home but somehow years have gone by and the organisation is still there. <p>The South Austin coalition community council, run for 26 years by Bob Vondrasek, is in one of Chicago's grittiest neighbourhoods. It has taken on slum landlords, insurance companies, utilities firms, the board of education and the big banks over predatory lending policies. In recent months, though, the coalition and other community leaders in the city have confronted an opponent of an altogether different magnitude; Wal-Mart, the biggest company in the world, which is looking to open its first store within the city limits. </p> <p>Its plans have provoked an emotionally charged response from politicians, civic leaders and the church. Supporters argue that local people in the rundown neighbourhoods where it plans to open are in desperate need of cheap goods as well as jobs. Those against protest that Wal-Mart represents the very worst in American business and that it destroys small businesses and pushes down labour standards. The low prices, they argue, come at too high a cost. </p> <p>\"People ask why are we targeting Wal-Mart?\" says Vondrasek. \"The reason is because they are so influential and once you knock out the big bully the others tend to fall in line.\" </p> <p>At the last count, Wal-Mart employed 1.3 million workers in the United States. This month alone, it is opening 12 stores across the country. It also owns businesses in Europe and Japan, including Asda in Britain. </p> <p>Last year it had sales of $256bn, accounting for 2% of US gross domestic product. If it were an independent nation, Wal-Mart would be the eighth biggest trading partner with China. </p> <p>The ramifications of the company's spread have even made the presidential election campaign. John Kerry recently called its health care benefits \"disgraceful\". Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, running an independent campaign for the White House, described it as \"a cancer on the economy\". Vice-president Dick Cheney, however, praised Wal-Mart during a visit to its head office in Bentonville, Arkansas. </p> <p>The Chicago case is not isolated. Local resistance in Inglewood, California, earlier this year prevented Wal-Mart from opening there. Local groups are also preparing for battle in Washington DC as the company looks for its first location in the capital. </p> <p>The argument for Wal-Mart is compellingly simple - it creates jobs and provides low prices to consumers. Its store in Forest Park, just outside Chicago, is selling Wrangler jeans for $14.94 (\u00a38), a flat screen TV for $96.94 (\u00a355) and a microwave oven for $29.87 (\u00a316). Economists believe Wal-Mart has played a significant role in keeping US inflation down. </p> <p>On the west side of Chicago low prices and jobs are both welcome. The predominately black and Hispanic neighbourhood of Austin was once a vibrant manufacturing community but has fallen into decline as the factories have closed and the service industry moved out. The community wrestles with poverty and is rife with drugs and gangs. </p> <p>Wal-Mart had planned for two stores in the city; the other, in the equally rundown south, was blocked. It hired local public relations and legal firms, including the law firm of Michael Daley, the mayor's brother, and won approval for the Austin store only after heated hearings. </p> <p>Alderwoman Emma Mitts was a key supporter. \"All of my community pretty much wanted to have the Wal-Mart,\" she says. \"The low prices are good for my community. They help keep food on the table. Because Chicago is a union town, they say Wal-Mart shouldn't be here. That's what the fight was really about. Well, some job to me is better than no job at all.\" </p> <p>Opponents question the long-term impact of a Wal-Mart store. They quote numerous studies that claim to prove its deleterious effect. A report by the University of Illinois suggests the store on Chicago's west side would create 200 local jobs but lead to the loss of 265 jobs as smaller shops were forced to close. </p> <p>\"Any city that allows a Wal-Mart in under the guise of creating jobs and economic development should be wary,\" says Nik Theodore, director at the university's centre for urban economic development. \"A new store doesn't add new jobs - it is redistributing consumer spend and jobs from other local retailers.\" </p> <p>A recent report from the University of California claimed that the company's employees in the state received an annual $86m in public assistance including public health insurance and subsidised housing because they earned so little. \"We keep telling people, 'You are getting cheap product but you are having to subsidise this enormously profitable company in other ways,\" says James Thindwa at Jobs for Justice in Chicago, a nationwide organisation that campaigns for workers rights. \"There is a disconnect in people's minds.\" </p> <p>The irony that Wal-Mart is building on the site of a closed factory on the west side of Chicago is painfully clear to many local residents. \"Wal-Mart wraps itself in the American flag, but even the flags they sell are made in China,\" Thindwa says. \"It is complex. You look at an area where adults are on the corner unemployed and Wal-Mart is promising jobs. There is an immediacy about it, which is quite compelling until you start getting into the arguments.\" </p> <p>Wal-Mart's response to growing criticism has been a public relations blitz. It has been running advertising campaigns featuring female and ethnic minority workers talking about how great it is to work there. It is sponsoring public radio and set up bursaries for journalists. It has commissioned its own economic studies that claim it benefits the economy. It claimed that if Wal-Mart could take 20% of the market in Los Angeles, it would save shoppers $3.6bn and create 36,400 jobs. It recently announced that senior management bonuses would be tied to achieving certain diversity targets, to ensure the fair promotion of women and minorities. </p> <p>\"There is a lot of disinformation out there,\" says Wal-Mart community affairs manager Mia Masten. \"We offer competitive wages and benefits.\" There was no diktat ordering suppliers to shop for parts overseas - \"our mantra is everyday low prices and to achieve that we just want the best price possible from suppliers\"; the low percentage of workers covered by health benefits is due to the high number of \"seniors and students\" doing part-time work; and people already covered by their partner's health benefits from other companies. </p> <p>Opposition to the company continues to grow, however. The National Trust in the US has put the state of Vermont on its list of most endangered historic places because of plans to build more mammoth stores there. Its president, Richard Moe, says there are \"communities all over America whose downtowns have been devastated by the arrival of big-box retailers\". </p> <p>Campaigners are preparing a national plan to engage Wal-Mart. Community groups in Chicago put together a series of demands to put to the company, including guarantees that it would pay a living wage, not take public subsidy, allow unions and use local contractors to build the store. They had hoped the local council would present them to Wal-Mart before granting approval, but it didn't. The hope now is for ongoing hearings into a similar \"big box ordinance\" that could yet derail Wal-Mart's plans. It would force guarantees from stores over 75,000 square feet including a minimum wage of $10.50 (\u00a36) an hour, $3 (\u00a31.70) an hour in benefits and freedom of speech. </p> <p>\"I think we all feel good that a tremendous amount of awareness has been created about Wal-Mart,\" Vondrasek says. \"We're not telling people not to shop there, but let's push them to be better corporate citizens.\" </p> <p>For every victory, though, there continue to be other defeats. People living in Contra Costa County in the San Francisco Bay area recently voted to repeal a council-passed rule banning the construction of \"big-box\" stores. Wal-Mart is planning to build 40 stores in California. </p> <p>The difficulty unions face is overcoming the short-term fix for poor urban areas that Wal-Mart appears to promise with what is essentially a macro-economic argument. \"Its strategy is to take the path of least resistance,\" Theodore says. \"It targets African-American neighbourhoods. The west side of Chicago has been hard hit by plant closures and you reach a point where you start to take it personally. It's a community that feels the growth elsewhere in the city has passed them by and it's kind of unfair for that community to be told 'no' again.\"</p>",
  "We note the letters from representatives of the Maltese and Swiss governments (Letters, September 24 and 30) in which both countries protest that they are not tax havens. The claim is based on the fact that the money they handle is \"clean\". <p>The Tax Justice Network would not dispute that both territories have established systems to tackle money laundering. But that does not stop them being tax havens. They offer substantial incentives to previous non-residents to live in their territories and pay little or no tax. Both offer corporate structures that enable companies to divert their profits to their countries and avoid taxes elsewhere. </p> <p>We do not suggest tax haven activity is illegal. What is worrying is that so many countries and professional people around the world seek to divert income from one territory into another to avoid tax payments. </p> <p>They undermine the income stream of elected governments which should have received the tax due, and they divert vital revenues from the governments of many of the poorer nations of the world, which do not have the resources to challenge this activity. The result is that tax havens directly contribute to poverty worldwide and to the particular plight of developing nations, many of which are forced to incur massive debt because they are compelled by falling tax yields to borrow on the financial markets to finance revenue and capital expenditure.<br> <b>John Christensen</b><br> <b>Richard Murphy</b><br> Tax Justice Network </p> <p>Professor JV Bannister (Letters, September 30) would not resonate with the Italian prosecutors chasing Parmalat's billions and hitting brick walls in Malta.

  "A round-the-world yachting champion and a veteran Greenpeace activist were seized by police yesterday as they sailed into a military exclusion zone to protest at transatlantic shipments of decommissioned nuclear warheads. <p>The demonstration by a flotilla of dinghies in Cherbourg harbour came the day before the expected docking of two vessels laden with 125kg (275lb) of weapons-grade plutonium.</p> <p>The material is being moved under a post-cold war agreement between the United States and Russia to recycle excess warheads into nuclear fuel. Greenpeace and other environmental groups have criticised the security precautions as inadequate and the transportation as unnecessary.</p> <p>The two men arrested were Eugene Riguidel, a famous French yachtsman who won the 1980 Whitbread round the world race, and John Castle, from Guernsey. They were intercepted and detained by teams of gendarmes on inflatable dinghies.</p> <p>\"They were arrested in the military arsenal,\" a Greenpeace nuclear campaigner, Shaun Burnie, said yesterday. \"Their boat's sails were cut down with knives. We have a flotilla of 50 to 70 boats in the Channel and on along the French coast ready to join our protests.\"</p> <p>The plutonium, sent by the US National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), left the port of Charleston, South Carolina, on September 20. Its voyage is expected to take two weeks.</p> <p>After being unloaded in Cherbourg, the plutonium will be driven more than 660 miles to a processing plant in south-east France operated by the state-owned nuclear company, Areva.</p> <p>While the material is on the British-registered vessels, the Pacific Pintail and Pacific Teal, its security is the responsibility of the UK government. The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday confirmed that a detachment of armed officers from the UK Atomic Energy Authority constabulary was on board. The Ministry of Defence denied any of its units were involved.</p> <p>Greenpeace alleges that the material will be vulnerable while crossing France. \"French nuclear transports of plutonium are usually made in light banana trucks,\" Mr Burnie said. \"The bigger issue is that Areva is hoping to expand plutonium use in Russia and the US. Efforts to control proliferation are being hijacked.\"</p> <p>An NNSA spokesman said the material was being sent to the French plant because no such facility was available in the US. If the process was successful, a plant could be built in the US and no more plutonium sent overseas. Once converted into fuel rods, the plutonium could not be used in a nuclear weapon.</p>",

  "The man who once represented Nelson Mandela and the family of his fellow-South African civil rights campaigner, the late Steve Biko, will soon be using his legal skills on behalf of the hunters rather than the hunted. Sir Sydney Kentridge QC, at 81 one of the most highly-regarded barristers in Britain, will make the case for the Countryside Alliance in its challenge to the government's use of the Parliament Act to force through anti-hunting legislation. <p>It is nearly 50 years since the young Kentridge, from a wealthy Johannesburg family and a graduate of the University of the Witwatersrand and Exeter College, Oxford, was a member of the team that successfully defended another young lawyer on treason charges in South Africa, Nelson Mandela.</p> <p>He was again in the defence legal team at the 1960s Rivonia trial when the African National Congress leader was given a life sentence that was to last until 1990. But he won his admiration. Four years ago, Mr Mandela, at the annual meeting of the general council of the South African Bar, paid tribute to him.</p> <p>Describing Sir Sydney as \"brilliant\", Mr Mandela also praised his wife and fellow advocate, Lady Felicia Kentridge, who, he said, had \"given a voice to the voiceless\" in helping to set up the Legal Resources Centre in South Africa, set up during the apartheid era to offer legal representation to those unable to afford it in their battles with the state.</p> <p>Years after appearing in what became known as the Treason Trial, Sir Sydney acted on behalf of the family of another South African legend, the late student leader, Steve Biko, whose story inspired the film Cry Freedom. His role then, at the inquest which took place in a special courtroom in Pretoria in 1978, was to attempt to investigate and expose the circumstances in which the young student leader had died in police custody.</p> <p>\"It was the most extraordinary feat of advocacy I have ever seen,\" said Marcel Berlins, who covered the case for the Times. Sir Sydney managed to cross-examine the witnesses in Afrikaans while, almost simultaneously, summarising their evidence in English for the benefit of the world's press who were in attendance. His skill played a major part in exposing the horrific way in which Biko had been treated by the authorities, both police and medical, although the initial verdict returned was one of accidental death.</p> <p>Then, in his 50s, Sir Sydney came to London and launched himself on what has been an equally successful legal career, albeit one much more associated with the establishment than that of his time in South Africa. He became a member of the powerful Brick Court chambers, a QC, and was knighted in 1999 for his international human rights work over the years.</p> <p>Perhaps his most famous recent client was Jeffrey Archer, who hired him when he had to appear before the Conservative party's ethics and integrity committee in 1999 at the start of his fall from grace. He also acted for the then lord chancellor, Derry Irvine, over claims that he had acted illegally in the appointment of his special adviser, and on behalf of P&amp;O over the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise. Lord Irvine described him as \"one of the finest lawyers of our age\".</p> <p>While he has acted, as barristers customarily do, for all-comers, his personal views have remained apparent. When, in 2000, he represented the islanders who had been removed from their homes on Diego Garcia to Mauritius to make way for a US military base, he told the judicial review that their case arose from \"a very sad and by no means creditable episode in British colonial history\". He has also acted for Britons held at Guantanamo Bay.</p> <p>He is much admired by his peers, as shown by the fact that the Bar Council has more than once called on him to represent it in court.</p> <p>Jeffrey Jowell, QC, professor of public law at University College London, said yesterday: \"He is one of the very few people at the bar who can switch effortlessly from one area of law to another. He is persistent, logical, erudite and he draws blood in his cross-examination by his quiet persistence and courtesy.\"</p> <p>The late Lord Reid, one of Britain's most famous judges, once described him as the finest advocate he had ever heard. His style in court is slow and deliberate rather than flashy. </p> <p>Now the opera-loving, cricket-loving Sir Sydney has the task of representing the Countryside Alliance against the government as it seeks to halt the move towards the banning of fox-hunting in yet another case which has inflamed passions, albeit very different ones from those that first led him to battle the state back in the 50s.</p>",
  "<p>Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo will this week accuse a handful of senior UK metals brokers of dishonestly assisting one of the largest rogue traders ever to operate through the London markets - convicted copper dealer Yasuo Hamanaka.</p> <p>Sumitomo is claiming damages in the commercial court of almost $700m (\u00a3400m), plus interest of $400m, from Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais Rouse, the French bank's London metals brokerage arm, where the men cleared colossal copper trades for Hamanaka and others.</p> <p>Hamanaka had been one of Sumitomo's star traders, known as \"Mr Five Per Cent\" for the proportion of the copper market he would corner on occasion. </p> <p>The Japanese firm claims Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais knew or turned a blind eye to the fact that Hamanaka was in fact operating as a rogue trader.</p> <p>Lawyers for Sumitomo will accuse Roy Leighton, chairman of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais Rouse, and two of his former directors of knowledge and dishonesty. The claim is hotly contested by the French bank, which is now known as Calyon following a takeover by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.</p> <p>Sumitomo lawyers will attempt to draw a link between a fourfold increase in the three directors' pay packages and a number of Hamanaka transactions on which commission was earned.</p> <p>They will also stress the financial ties between Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais and Winchester Commodities, another brokerage firm more intimately involved in the Hamanaka transactions. Under a risk-sharing agreement, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais was entitled to up to 20% of Winchester's profits in exchange for covering 20% of losses.</p> <p>Together the two brokerages worked on a series of trades for Hamanaka which, Sumitomo lawyers will claim, showed no commercial rationale. The trades nevertheless earned unprecedented levels of commission, particularly for Winchester, a small Hampshire-based firm run by Charles \"Copperfingers\" Vincent and Ashley Levett, although neither are accused of any wrongdoing.</p> <p>Ashurst, the law firm advising Sumitomo, will characterise many of these transactions as \"wash trades\" that allowed Hamanaka to book a profit. Lawyers for Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, however, will point out its role as clearing broker was different to that of Winchester. It never set up, priced or executed trades, often learning of them after the event.</p> <p>The French bank will suggest Sumitomo's claim is \"far-fetched\" and \"hypocritical\". Its lawyers will tell the court, when opening statements are delivered on Thursday that Sumitomo's losses - about $2.6bn - were a consequence of its own failure to manage Hamanaka. </p> <p>In 1997 Hamanaka was convicted and sentenced in Tokyo to eight years in prison with hard labour for fraud and forgery. A year later Sumitomo paid about $150m to settle claims from British and US regulators, though it did not admit or deny allegations. No regulatory action has been brought against Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais. Winchester was wound up as investigations began to focus on the Hamanaka trades.</p> <p>Much of Hamanaka's trading in the 80s and 90s was transacted through \"off market\" deals, outside the London Metals Exchange. These trades led to settlements with a number of major banks, including Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan, neither of which admitted liability. A claim against UBS was lost in May.</p>",
  "Government powers enabling foreigners to be detained without limit under emergency anti-terror laws threaten the values they were designed to protect, the law lords were told today. <p>Nine men being held under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act are seeking to overturn a court of appeal decision backing the powers of the home secretary, David Blunkett, to detain them without charge or trial. </p> <p>The act was passed shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington in 2001, which killed around 3,000 people.</p> <p>The detainees' pleas are being heard by a court made up of nine law lords, rather than the usual five, because of the constitutional importance of the legal challenge, the result of which is likely to make headlines around the world. </p> <p>Ben Emmerson QC, representing seven of the detainees, opened the hearing in the Moses room next to the main chamber of the House of Lords. He said the fundamental issue was whether the government could lawfully detain a criminal suspect without charge indefinitely. </p> <p>\"Despite the complexity of some submissions in this case, the ultimate issue is really very straightforward,\" he said. \"We say that in a democracy it is unacceptable to lock up potentially innocent people without trial or without any indication when, if ever, they are going to be released. </p> <p>\"We say it is doubly unacceptable for a democracy committed to the principles of equality and anti-discrimination to single out foreign nationals when it is not prepared to apply the same measures to its own nationals.\" </p> <p>Mr Emmerson said nobody could doubt that the September 11 attacks were a direct assault on the values of democracy and represented a new brand of ruthless terrorism with no regard for human rights. </p> <p>\"There is an inevitable temptation for parliaments and governments to fight fire with fire and set aside legal safeguards which exist within a democratic state,\" he said. \"We can fall into the trap which terrorism sets for democracy and the rule of law by destroying those values.\" </p> <p>To hold suspects indefinitely, the government had to opt out of the obligation of providing a right to a fair trail provided under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p> <p>The government's argument for this was based on the al-Qaida network being a public emergency and a threat to the life of the nation. But Mr Emmerson said in denying the right to fair trial the government had \"wrongly adopted and permitted measures fundamentally inconsistent with the core values of democracy and justice\". </p> <p>He said the men he was representing had already been in custody for nearly three years on the basis that they might be supporters of international terrorism. He said they had been given no idea when, if ever, they would be released, had never been formally interviewed and there was no prospect that they would ever be put on trial. </p> <p>The justification for this, said Mr Emmerson, was the continuing threat from terrorism, according to the government. But this threat was likely to continue indefinitely and Mr Blunkett had misconstrued the meaning of the expression \"public emergency\", Mr Emmerson said. </p> <p>He said the measures were not now required by the situation, were disproportionate and contravened Britain's obligations under international law. </p> <p>Mr Emmerson told the judges that Mr Blunkett was justifying the detainment laws by saying that he was dealing with a ruthless international terrorist organisation which was prepared to wait for the opportunity to strike and might do so anywhere at any time. \"But to move from that to say there is a threat and take the exceptional step of suspending human rights obligations is a very, very substantial step indeed,\" said Mr Emmerson. </p> <p>The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith QC, leads a team of lawyers who will defend the government's stance. </p> <p>He will argue that the 2001 attacks were an \"unprecedented form of terrorism\", a new phase in an \"ideological war by Islamist extremists that demanded a robust response from the government. He will say that the measures taken were \"well within\" the scope of what was open to parliament. </p> <p>The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p>It would appear to be a happy and satisfying relationship. \"Our priorities are aligned,\" says one document. There have been \"notable successes\" says another, citing \"another example\" of where the two sides \"cooperated well\". In business partners, this would seem to indicate a harmony of views. The documents obtained by the Guardian, however, relate to meetings between the drug industry and the watchdog body set up by government to police it. </p> <p>Critics say the drug regulator and the industry are too close. Their proceedings have long been shrouded in secrecy because of the drug companies' insistence on the commercial sensitivity of information relating to their products. </p> <p>Today, documents obtained by the Guardian under the open government code reveal the reality of relations between the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the trade association of the industry it regulates. The documents show that: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the regulator and the industry have been engaged in a joint lobbying campaign in Europe; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the industry privately drew up its own detailed blueprint of how the MHRA should be run; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the industry has been pushing for higher level representation at the MHRA against ministers' wishes. </p> <p>Since 1989, when the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, took drug regulation out of the hands of the Department of Health, the MHRA has been 100% funded by the pharmaceutical companies. </p> <p>The MHRA's chief executive, Kent Woods, appointed in January, has no drug company background, but critics say the agency continues in the unquestioning belief that the regulator and the industry are working together in the mutual interests of public health. </p> <p>John Abraham, professor of sociology at Sussex University, who is well respected for his books on drug regulation, says that in 1989 there was a reconstruction of the regulators' mission alongside the new fees relationship. The MHRA came to believe the interests of public health are coherent with the promotion of the industry. </p> <p>\"The criticism of the old Department of Health medicines department in the 70s was that it didn't have any teeth. Not only does it now not have any teeth, but it is not motivated to bite,\" he said. </p> <p>The MHRA told the Commons health select committee inquiry into the influence of the industry that it does not consider the fee relationship to be a problem. </p> <p>\"I would suggest to a lay person there is a big problem with the concept of independence from industry of a body that is fully funded by industry,\" said Professor Abraham. The UK's regulatory agency competes with those of other countries to approve drugs for the whole of Europe. </p> <p>But Professor Woods says that neither industry funding nor close liaison is a problem. \"It is important that the regulator understands the regulated industry. </p> <p>\"I have to say that our areas of overlapping interests are not 100%. There are some things where we have common cause but our prime responsibility is to ensure we protect public health. These are aims which the industry shares. I don't think there is a necessary antipathy between what the ABPI [The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry] is trying to achieve and what we are trying to achieve. But there are other areas in which we can't agree.\" </p> <p>Richard Ley, spokesman for the ABPI, denied that the ABPI had the MHRA \"in its pocket\". \"The objective of the MHRA is to ensure that medicines are assessed to be effective and as safe as possible. Those are also our aims. We have an absolute desire to have good quality medicines.\" </p> <p>The documents record the regular meetings and dinners between the MHRA and the ABPI over the past year. </p> <p>Among the \"notable successes\" of its close collaboration with the industry, the MHRA paper cited how it \"cooperated well\" with the trade association to lobby other European governments and the European commission on a review of legislation governing drug companies. It was, according to the briefing paper, \"another example where the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry and the MHRA worked closely together\". </p> <p>Minutes of a meeting between the ABPI and senior MHRA officials in April record that the \"ABPI thought there was a remarkable concordance between MHRA and their priorities...\" </p> <p>At their meeting with the MHRA top officials in June, the ABPI presented an eight-page blueprint detailing how it thinks the MHRA should be run to \"build upon the excellent working relationship\" between the industry and the regulator. According to this document, \"our priorities are aligned [ABPI/MHRA]\". </p> <p>Following this meeting, Nicky Lilliott, the ABPI's head of regulatory affairs, wrote to Professor Woods, to confirm that, as agreed, the ABPI would develop an action plan to discuss a wide range of issues for the future of the agency. \"I would propose that over the summer the ABPI drafts an action plan and this is then circulated to yourself and colleagues for comments, with the intention to agree the action plan at our meeting in September.\" </p> <p>\"The action plan would need assigned topic leaders, joint ABPI/MHRA, in order to achieve the agreed objectives/milestones. The main driver for the actions and timelines for these issues will be the implementation (of) the new pharmaceutical legislation by October 2005\". Professor Woods said the action plan related to establishing a framework for bilateral meetings. The documents show the ABPI is unhappy at proposed changes to the structure of the MHRA. It used to have three people on the ministerial advisory board and two on the Medicines Commission, the drug licensing appeal body. </p> <p><strong> Pressure</strong><br> </p> <p> In a letter to Professor Sir Alistair Breckenridge in January, Dr John Patterson, the ABPI president, wrote: \"We remain concerned at the lack of representation of the pharmaceutical industry at board level within the MHRA ... As the only regulatory agency that is fully industry-funded, we believe it is essential that we have a say on a variety of issues, not least financial matters relating to fees and service levels.\" </p> <p>After more pressure, MHRA officials discussed alternative arrangements. Roy Alder, a senior MHRA official, suggested in March that \"there could be scope for industry to make a similar input to MHRA business and operational policy\" through other ways. He wrote: \"Ministers are clear that the MHRA board should have no current industry people. There seems no option on this issue.\" He suggested someone recently retired from the industry could possibly be put on the board, \"but ministers may want to avoid any perception of industry interests at board level.\" </p> <p>The Committee on the Safety of Medicines (CSM), made up of independent experts, advises the MHRA on which drugs to license after studying clinical trial data on safety and efficacy. Its members are supposed to declare any sponsorship or payments they receive for lectures or advice from industry. The last complete declaration of interests of CSM members, for 2001, shows 17 out of 36 members had personal financial links to the industry, while others have declared non-personal interests such as research grants. </p> <p>The documents show that industry has been agitated about ministers' \"unrealistic\" plans to tighten the rules on conflicts of interests. The ABPI complained ministers were \"being too restrictive in the requirement for experts to not hold any personal interests in the pharmaceutical industry.\" </p> <p>Professor Abraham claims there is too much of the \"revolving door\" syndrome at the MHRA. Not only do CSM members take fees from industry, but many agency officials used to work for drug companies, such as the former head of worldwide drug safety at GlaxoSmithKline, who is now the MHRA's head of licensing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tomorrow: How drug companies pay to persuade doctors to prescribe their products</p>",
  "<p>A leading figure in the world of psychiatry gave a pharmaceutical company advice on how to get its new drug approved while he was sitting on the committee which was deciding the licence application. </p> <p>An internal memorandum from Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, says Stuart Montgomery would be happy to become a paid adviser and declare an interest to the Committee on the Safety of Medicines (CSM) once the drug, an antidepressant to rival Prozac, had been through the licensing process. </p> <p>The drug, sertraline, which acquired the brand name Lustral, became a billion-dollar success, but is now one of several banned from use in children in the UK because of evidence they can cause them to become suicidal. Their use in adults is under investigation. </p> <p>Dr Montgomery says his ad vice to Pfizer in 1989 was permissible because he was not receiving money from the company at the time. But Kent Woods, chief executive of the drug regulatory body which grants licences on the advice of the CSM, said such conduct was \"absolutely unacceptable\". </p> <p>\"Not only does each member [of the CSM] on appointment sign a letter ensuring confidentiality but at every meeting, the chair as a matter of routine reminds everybody that proceedings are confidential,\" he said. If the company had questions, they should have talked to officials of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), not the independent CSM experts. </p> <p>Critics say the case exposes weaknesses in the drug licensing system, run by a regulatory body which, other papers obtained by the Guardian reveal, has an unquestioning relationship with drug companies. </p> <p>That relationship is so close that the pharmaceutical trade body in June drew up a business plan for the regulator, concluding: \"Our priorities are aligned.\" </p> <p>In the first of a two-part investigation into the influence of the drug companies over doctors and government, the Guardian examines the intimacy between the industry and the regulator. . Tomorrow it will focus on the sponsorship, consultancies and fees paid to doctors by drug companies. </p> <p>The MHRA is responsible for licensing medicines and regulating the industry. It relies on the advice of the independent experts on the CSM when it grants a new product licence. These experts, from all fields of medicine, are supposed to declare any pharmaceutical company interests, such as consultancies, fees and shareholdings, and must leave the room when drugs from com panies that have paid them are discussed. During his time on the CSM, Dr Montgomery disclosed payments for lectures and advice from Eli Lilly, the makers of Prozac, and from Organon, Beecham, Merck, Sanofi, Glaxo, Novo, Jouveinal, Duphar, Wyeth and Almirall. </p> <p>Dr Montgomery, who held a joint post with St Mary's hospital, Paddington, and Imperial College in London, was a psychiatric expert on the CSM. His opinion was crucial in 1989, when the Medicines Control Agency as it was then known was considering an application from Pfizer for a licence for sertraline. </p> <p>A confidential internal memorandum from Pfizer, dated April 24 1989, which was submitted in evidence to a recent court case in the US, has been obtained by the Guardian together with Mind, the national association for mental health, which has been campaigning for better drug regulation. Richard Brook, its chief executive, will today call for an external inquiry. \"There is clear confusion about the role that Dr Montgomery was playing in this situation,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It also makes it very difficult for outsiders to believe there was not a serious conflict of interest when one of the major experts on depression involved in the CSM is actually speaking to a drug company about how they best present their results for licencing.\" </p> <p>Dr Montgomery became a professor of psychiatry at Imperial College in 1993. The journal he edits, International Psychopharmacology, regularly publishes company-funded studies of antidepressants, as other journals do. He authors many of the papers, often jointly with other senior figures in the field. </p> <p>The memo reveals that Dr Montgomery met Pfizer officials at St Mary's. He told them the committee had accepted that the drug was effective but \"the safety analyses require re-presentation\" and he advised them how to go about it. </p> <p>He told Pfizer they must appeal against the CSM's initial decision. The memo reveals that Dr Montgomery is not going to declare an interest in Pfizer. </p> <p>\"He would still like to remain a disinterested party at the CSM till the appeal was heard,\" says the memo. \"Thereafter he would be happy to act as an adviser to Pfizer and declare an interest.\" </p> <p>The Pfizer drug got its approval first in the UK. Other European regulators were not happy that the data from clinical trials proved it worked. </p> <p>Dr Montgomery said he had no conflict of interest over Pfizer. \"My comments to Pfizer in 1989 were the usual clarification of the objections of the CSM to their application. At that time I had no conflict of interest with Pfizer, I was not a paid consultant, I was not in receipt of research grants from Pfizer, and I did not own shares in Pfizer,\" he said in an email to the Guardian. </p> <p>\"The extracts from the memorandum make it clear that I was a disinterested party and was not prepared to consider a relationship with Pfizer while an application was under review.\" </p>",
  "<p>Kurt Warner, perhaps more than maybe any other American Football athlete, understands the bright light of stardom, and how quickly it can fade. Once of the NFL's most famous Cinderella stories, Warner emerged from the Arena Football League (Gridiron's brutal indoor version) to lead St. Louis to Superbowl victory in his first full NFL season (which he began as a reserve).</p> <p>In spite of these heroics - and his 98 touchdown passes in three seasons as starter - Warner found himself a forgotten man this summer, released by the Rams after failing to regain the starting spot he lost in St Louis during an injury-plagued start to 2002. </p> <p>Almost an after-thought, he was picked up in June to serve as a mentor to rookie starlet Eli Manning - the latest in a fine lineage of quarterbacks from the Manning family, a man who arrived in May as the first pick of the NFL's annual college draft with a contract worth $54m before ever taking an NFL snap. Warner's contract, meanwhile, is reported to be just $3m.</p> <p>A devout Christian, Warner has never been one to complain - as evinced by his commendably supportive attitude of struggling starting quarterback Marc Bulger in St. Louis during 2003 when many Rams followers felt Warner might provide a better solution. </p> <p>In New York, Warner knew he would be allowed to compete for the starting job for a year at least - and took advantage, despite the impatience of a vocal section of supporters demanding immediate viewing of their investment.</p> <p>The murmurs of discontent on the stands, however, have been rapidly hushed by an unexpectedly strong opening to the season for the Giants, who have leapt out to a 3-1 record on the back of Warner's passing and strong running from eighth-year running back Tiki Barber. The offensive production has been by no means overwhelming, but Tom Coughlin's mentality of disciplined football prioritises ball control above all else.</p> <p>Coughlin described the turnover ratio yesterday as \"the number one winning statistic\", an idea the two veterans are buying into; Barber is yet to fumble the ball this year after working hard on his technique in the off-season, whilst Warner has completed an impressive 67.5% of his passes this season. Indeed, he only threw his first interception of the season this weekend, breaking a streak of 127 passes without a pick.</p> <p>This week, New York delivered their strongest signal of intent to the league so far, each contributing a touchdown to a surprising Giants victory over Green Bay at Lambeau Field.</p> <p>Barber, who many would expect to see slowing down as he turns the wrong side of 30, slashed the Packers defence for 182 yards on just 23 carries, whilst Warner completed 20 of 26 passes for 187 yards. Impressive enough figures in their own right, these numbers represented an even more important achievement given the number of errors committed by their team-mates, who combined for eight penalties, whilst kicker Steve Christie missed all three of his field goal attempts.</p> <p>In truth, the Giants should really have wrapped the game up earlier than they did, as Green Bay once again disappointed their home support with a display that was incoherent on offence and simply poor on defence.</p> <p>The Packers have now lost three games in a row for the first time since Mike Sherman (now in his fifth year) became head coach, and - most disturbingly of all - must now wait on news on the condition of Brett Favre, who did not return to the field after hitting Javon Walker for the 28-yard touchdown that gave the Packers the lead early in the third quarter.</p> <p>The resilient future hall-of-famer, now in his fourteenth year, had in fact already been told not to return to the field by medical staff before he threw the pass; impressive perhaps, but Warner also claimed afterwards that Favre did not remember the touchdown when they spoke after the game.</p> <p>Concussions have ended the career of many an NFL quarterback over the years, and it is common knowledge that Favre flirted with retirement after the 2003 season; on yesterday's evidence the post-Favre era in Green Bay does not look bright.</p> <p>For Warner and the Giants, however, it has been a promising start, and it would seem that Eli may just have to wait, for a season at least. He remains the future of the franchise, and for 54 million reasons you can be sure he will get his chance, but for the meantime the field belongs to Warner, and it seems nobody in New York is complaining.</p> <p><strong>NFL round-up</strong></p> <p>In other action this weekend New England (3-0) recorded seven sacks of their former signal caller Drew Bledsoe, as they overran Buffalo (0-3) 31-17 to register their record-tying eighteenth consecutive victory.</p> <p>Their opponents next week, as they bid to break the record, will be winless Miami (0-4), who fell 17-9 at home to divisional rivals the New York Jets (3-0). Philladelphia (4-0) also kept up their early season form as they overcame Chicago (1-3) 19-9 in a gritty contest, whilst fellow Super Bowl hopefuls Indianapolis (3-1) handed the Jacksonville Jaguars and second year quarterback Byron Leftwich (3-1) their first loss of the year.</p> <p>Running back Emmitt Smith threw the first touchdown of his illustrious career to help Arizona (1-3) register their first win of the season 34-10 over the New Orleans Saints (2-2), whilst their divisional rivals St. Louis (2-2) and San Francisco (0-4) clashed in the late game, with St. Louis emerging victorious 24-14.</p> <p>Elsewhere Pittsburgh (3-1) overcame rivals Cincinatti 28-17, Houston (2-2) beat Oakland (2-2) 30-17 in the two teams' first ever clash, Cleveland (2-2) edged Washington (1-3) 17-13, Michael-Vick inspired Atlanta (4-0) routed last-season's Super Bowl runners-up Carolina (1-2) 27-10, Denver (3-1) got by Tampa Bay (0-4) 16-13 and San Diego (2-2) defeated struggling Tennessee (1-3) 38-17.</p>",
  "<p>Seven doctors at a private drug clinic facing charges of serious professional misconduct were today accused of failing to exercise care for their patients.</p> <p>The General Medical Council (GMC) hearing against the six men and one woman at the Stapleford centre, which resumed today, is expected to have major ramifications in the prescription of drugs such as heroin and methadone. </p> <p>The seven doctors are accused of failing to take steps to ensure prescribed drugs would not end up being sold on the black market. It is thought to be the first time in the GMC's 145-year history that so many doctors have been jointly accused.</p> <p>The doctors, who include the clinic's founder, Colin Brewer, his recently retired deputy, four full-time doctors and one who no longer works there, are alleged to have misprescribed excessive amounts of medicine, as well as providing irresponsible combinations of drugs such as methadone and the \"date-rape\" drug rohypnol. </p> <p>The case relates to the treatment of 16 patients at the Stapleford centre, which has sites in Belgravia in central London and Stapleford Tawney in Essex. Some of the charges stretch back to 1990.</p> <p>Dr Brewer, 63, registered as of Eccleston Street, central London, faces the bulk of the allegations at today's professional conduct committee hearing relating to his treatment of 13 patients and a charge of interfering with potential witnesses. </p> <p>The other doctors charged are Anthony Haines, 75, registered as of Le Bourg, Vitrac St Vincent in France; Hugh Kindness, 66, of Ashtead in Surrey; Nicolette Mervitz, 30, as of Benmore, Johannesburg, South Africa; Martin O'Rawe, in his mid-40s, of Cambridge Gardens, west London; Ronald Tovey, 47, of Chesham, Buckinghamshire; and Timothy Willocks, 47, of Stalybridge, Cheshire. </p> <p>The GMC today heard that there were differing views as to how drug users should be treated but the field was not \"without boundaries\". </p> <p>GMC counsel Andrew Collender QC said: \"The responsibility and appropriate care of drug users accommodates some range of differing views but that is not to say that this is a field of medicine without boundaries.\" </p> <p>He added: \"This inquiry is not about differences of opinion in the responsible debate about the treatment of drug users. This inquiry is about failure by these doctors to exercise care in certain specific respects.\" </p> <p>It is believed the clinic was operating a policy of long-term \"maintenance prescribing\", intended to allow patients to stop buying drugs from black market dealers, in contrast to the standard approach of the NHS where patients frequently only get 24-hour prescriptions.</p> <p>There was a small demonstration outside the hearing today in support of the Stapleford centre doctors. Speaking outside the hearing, Joep Oomen, co-ordinator for the European Coalition for Just and Effective Drug Policies, said: \"International legislation has done more harm than drugs themselves could have done and we are here to support British drug users and their medical doctors who have helped them in the past.\"</p>",
  "John Redwood made a full-throated return to the fray today with a largely off-the-cuff speech that hit reassuringly familiar Conservative buttons - Brussels, fish and the plight of motorists - and promised to push through a \"great deregulation bill\" in the first year of a Tory government. <p>The new shadow secretary of state for deregulation abandoned the curt restraint which once characterised his speeches and promised to compile a list of government regulations \"for repeal and amendment\" within weeks.</p> <p>\"Yes, I'm back!\" Mr Redwood told delegates in a speech peppered with sardonic irony and furious asides. \"I can't stand this government and I can't stand what they're doing!\"</p> <p>The first year of a Tory government would see a \"major deregulation bill\" put through parliament, the Wokingham MP promised. \"I have more government than I want,\" he told delegates. \"More government than I need. And a lot more government than I can afford.\"</p> <p>Citing EU restrictions on herbal medicines, horse passports and the \"murder\" of fish too small to catch \"in the name of conservation\", Mr Redwood told the hall a No vote in the promised referendum on the EU constitution would be the first step in a rollback of European-led legislation under a Conservative government.</p> <p>\"If a department wants a new law, it will have to explain why,\" he promised. \"On day one, ministers in the new government will explain to officials that we are not in the business of passing four thousand new laws a year ... In week one, departments will be asked to bring forward their contribution to the great deregulation bill.\"</p> <p>He said the growth in pensions regulation and Railtrack's bankruptcy were proof of the government's over-interference in and over-regulation of business. </p> <p>Defending the right of motorists to own and run cars without the proliferation of \"speed cameras that are there to make money\", Mr Redwood won a standing ovation from delegates, many of whom were elated to see the former Welsh secretary back on the conference podium.</p> <p>\"I am delighted he's back,\" said a glowing Norma Bodger, a party activist from south Dorset, after Mr Redwood had spoken. \"I am very much a Eurosceptic and I believe in his policy towards it. John Redwood is a favourite of mine!\"</p> <p>\"He's the genuine article,\" said Ivor Palmer of north-west Hampshire.</p> <p>Not everyone, however, was won over. \"I do not rate him highly, really,\" said Helen Pearson of the Poole constituency party. \"I find him rather ineffectual and supercilious. He will give the wrong impression to voters.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>PLACE YOUR BETS NOW</strong></p> <p>The last time the Fiver saw TV's John McCririck in the flesh his hands were waving around like a pill-popping raver. Wave! Blur! Confusion! Old Man Smell! Still, at least we could be sure of one thing: judging by his tatty jacket, badger-bushy sideburns and his reaction to the 2.20pm novice chase at Wincanton, the Channel 4 racing pundit wasn't about to dip into a secret multi-million dollar treasure chest and purchase Manchester United.</p> <p>However the Fiver can't be so confident about McCririck's US doppelganger, billionaire businessman Malcolm Glazer - the man who's now odds-on favourite in the ongoing Manchester United Ownership Stakes. Today, United announced that it had received a preliminary approach regarding a takeover and, although they're not saying who, the smart money is that Glazer - who already owns 19.2% of the club - is sniffing around like a Collymore in the bushes.</p> <p>\"The approach contains a number of significant conditions,\" a statement released to the Stock Exchange droned like an early Zeppelin. \"The company is seeking clarification of this proposal and at this stage it is unclear whether any offer will be made.\" And that's not the only obstacle - Glazer would probably have to borrow to buy out United's leading shareholders JP McManus and John Magnier, who own a whopping 29% of the club.</p> <p>But if the deal does go ahead, United fans fear the worst. Glazer is the man, after all, who owns Tampa Bay Buccaneers - the team with the most expensive ticket prices in the NFL. And, seeing as he's 75, he's bound to want a return on his investment sharpish. Rooney to Madrid for \u00a360m, anyone?

  "<p>Firstly, we in England have become so addicted to the concept of the teacher as a generalist that it is rarely if ever challenged. We also have a perhaps surprising number of men and women who even at secondary level can teach their subject both to those who will gain an A grade in it at A-level and those who will struggle to gain any pass at GCSE.</p> <p>Yet the crisis in teacher recruitment and our failure to produce enough students willing to study maths, physics, chemistry and modern languages at university must force us to question the concept of the generalist teacher.</p> <p>It is grossly politically incorrect to say so - but how reasonable is it of us to expect a person with a 2:1 in physics to teach not only a bright and aspirational A-level class, but also to teach those for whom a C grade at GCSE in combined science is an almost impossible dream?</p> <p>How many of us know the teacher who is brilliant with the Oxbridge class, and hopeless with the less able? And the reverse? Yet are we not at the same time marvellously hypocritical? We all recognise the need for and have the highest professional regard for our special needs teachers, many of whom focus on the lowest-achieving pupils. Yet are not the most gifted also in their own way a special need? Yet why do we raise up our hands in horror at the suggestion that to be a teacher a colleague must teach across all ability bands? </p> <p>Why do we damn a top mathematician or physicist when they cannot intuitively relate to a pupil who does not share their passion for the subject? Why do we insist that all teachers should be all things to all pupils? Is this not the worst manifestation of the one-size-fits-all philosophy?</p> <p>It is simple common sense to recognise that teaching the potential undergraduates in our schools is simply an honourable specialisation. You do not even have to abolish the comprehensive system to let this happen. You do need to reassure some teachers that if they join the professions they will not be asked to teach groups for whom they can have no understanding.</p> <p>Let us create the specialist academic teacher in all schools in the UK, and in so doing recognise that the most able are as much a special needs category as the least able.</p> <p>And while we're at it, let's scotch once and for the idea that the independent sector poaches teachers from the maintained sector. In a straw poll at my last school 56% of teachers stated that they either would not have come into the profession or stayed in it without the existence of that particular independent school or others like it. </p> <p>We are not only the largest single producer of NQT's of any organisation in the UK. We draw graduate teachers into the profession with great success. And if only we could end the stupid apartheid whereby it is so difficult for a teacher in the independent sector to transfer to a maintained school we could well become one of this country's greatest assets in teacher recruitment. This leads on to my second point. It is one of the greatest myths about independent schools that they are all highly selective. Ask many a boarding school head or the Head of a small day school just how selective they are and see them give you a rueful grin. Ask the head of the school that gained just under 87% of A-levels at A or B grade this year, with 20% of that cohort in the MIDYIS D band and 20% in the MIDYIS C band. </p> <p>Yet we do countenance selection in our schools. The present prime minister, the secretary of state for education and the leader of the opposition are all the product of selective schools.</p> <p>Does this reflect well or badly on selection? It probably reflects well on a system that exercised the fatal, dread 's' work, the word that above all has become the battle of the Somme for English education: selection.</p> <p>Shout out 'SELECTION!' in the exercise yard of English education and there's no debate, no advance, no movement forward. Instead the troops divide into two, scuttle back to the trenches and start to blast the hell out of each other from their respective barbed wire trenches. Like soldiers from an earlier age, we have become bogged down in a life-sapping conflict. Yet if we chuck dogma out of the window there is an answer to the problem of selection. It requires three things. It probably only works if 14 is the age where a young person is offered the choice between a vocational path, an academic path or a mixture of both. It needs us to spend the money on the technical or vocational side that we never spent in 1947, and most of all it means giving total control of the nature and content of vocational examinations to employers, so that a vocational qualification gives the candidate the set of skills employers want and hence a real ticket to a job. </p> <p>And yes, for a proportion of our young people, let's have our grammar schools, our lycees or our gymnasiums, call them what you will. But let us allow any child who wishes to go the grammar school to take up their place there at the age of 14.</p> <p>No dreaded 11+. No qualifying examination. Quite literally, a place for any child or family who opts for it.</p> <p>The catch? After that first year, the child has to satisfy the academic criteria to move into the second year. In their first year the young person has had access to the ambience of the grammar school, the specialist teachers, the books. They have had the opportunity. If they fail to meet the matriculation standard? No-one culls them, throws them out, puts them on scrap heap. They can repeat the first year, repeat any year in the grammar school, for as long as they wish. My middle son, who at the age of 15 spent a year in a French lycee, saw nothing odd in sharing his year with three or four others three or four years his senior.</p> <p>Grammar schools died because they denied opportunity to two thirds of the populace. The open access grammar school is hugely demanding in resources, particularly for that enlarged first year. It means more schools, more places and more money. Yet it is a wonderful tick in the box of rightwing, liberal and leftwing philosophy. It is a pure meritocracy, where everyone can join and no-one has to leave. </p> <p>And this leads directly to my final point.</p> <p>I think we criticise politicians unfairly with regard to education. Politicians have children too. I have yet to meet one who tried to make education worse for children in the UK.</p> <p>Yet the truth is that we have an educational system in the UK that arouses deep dissent and dissatisfaction, and the final responsibility for that system is held by the successive governments who have redesigned and redesigned our education system so that it bears a resemblance to a wound operated on so often that all that is left is scar tissue. </p> <p>Post-war we had grammar schools, technical schools and secondary modern schools. Love them or hate them, at least we all knew where we were. Then we had comprehensive schools. Again, love them or hate them, we thought we knew where we were. </p> <p>And now? We have 11-16 comprehensive schools, we have 11-18 comprehensive schools, we have grammar schools. I think we even have some middle schools left. We have high schools, voluntary-aided schools, church schools and faith schools. We have specialist schools. We have city technology colleges, city academies - which, by the way, I support. We have independent schools. We have sixth form colleges, further education colleges. We might even still have some bog basic comprehensive schools.</p> <p>If you want to feel a real fool, try explaining the English secondary education system to a delegation of visiting teachers from Wu Han province in China. Look to our present multiplicity of systems and schools and be reminded of the terrible vision in W.B.Yeats's poem The Second Coming?</p> <p>'Turning and turning in the widening gyre <br> The falcon cannot hear the falconer; <br> Things fall apart. The Centre cannot hold; <br> Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world ... <br> The best lack all conviction, while the worst <br> Are full of passionate intensity.\"</p> <p>The best who lack all conviction might well be a description of our sector for too many years past. I leave it to you to decide if we have a name for the worst who are full of passionate intensity.</p> <p>Yet I emphasise that it is too easy to blame the politicians. The real problem is that education simply does not fit into the time span of a five-year government, even less so when after even three years getting elected becomes the top priority. And what more tempting for a government seeking to refresh its image or a party wanting to create it than to tamper yet again with our educational system? We force bad or muddled decisions on our political leaders because we do not give them the time education needs.</p> <p>Yet there is a ray of hope.</p> <p>We privatised the bank rate. We gave over one of the most crucial economic decisions a government has to a panel of duly-appointed experts.</p> <p>Is it not time that we recognised we have made a great mistake. In accepting that government is responsible for delivering the educational system, have we not too easily assumed that it must also design it?</p> <p>How can government design our education system? Government of whatever party carries into office a huge baggage of history and sometimes of dogma, sometimes with the result that educational debate is no such thing, but is rather the unpacking of endless old suitcases. Government has five or at most ten years to plan and execute its policy, less time than a single child spends in the system. </p> <p>We can never realistically remove from government control of spending on education, or responsibility for delivery of the system. Yet isn't it time we took the design of secondary education policy out of the hands of government and party politics in particular? </p> <p>Education is a service industry. Who are the end-users of our product? Universities, further education and employers. </p> <p>My suggestion is for a permanent, standing commission designated with the task of recommending a lasting pattern for secondary education in the UK. The dominant body on that standing commission should be composed of the end-users of secondary education in the UK. A third of the proposed body would be drawn from our universities. A third would be drawn from employers. The final third would be drawn from parents of secondary-age children, and from heads and teachers in the secondary system. </p> <p>We would seek the development of long term educational policy, of types of school that would last longer than the lifespan of one, two or even three governments. We [would] give control of secondary education back to those who use it, the universities and employers, whilst giving a serious voice to the providers - the teachers - and the consumers: parents speaking on behalf of their children.</p> <p>The problems are immense. But so are our problems with the present system. How could you preserve that commission from being hijacked by specialist interests and lobbies? What happens if the educational system recommended by that commission is unaffordable? What happens if a Labour government is threatened with losing the next election because the commission recommends the return of a form of grammar school? </p> <p>What happens if a conservative government is threatened with losing the next general election because the commission recommends the retention of comprehensive schools? Are our politicians, who will always retain control of the purse strings, brave enough to accept a recommendation that they wish had not been made? </p> <p>Well, perhaps we shall find the answer when the Bank of England changes the interest rate at a time when the government would rather it did not do so</p> <p>Problems? Of course there are problems. Yet problems have never been a good excuse for doing nothing. Rather they are a spur to doing more. And if such a group is ever formed, perhaps HMC could ask it, as part of its deliberations, to see independent education as an asset, not a liability to Education UK; as a partner in education, not a rival; as a jewel in the crown and not part of the dirty linen; as a guardian of values that have stood the test of time; not an upholder of outmoded tradition; not as a pure market economy, but as a system of schooling that has to listen to its parents without being afraid to challenge them; as a major force for future change, not a reminder of times past.</p> <p>Let's start to make our education structures something decided by those who need it, by those who use it and by those who know about it because they work in it. Let's make the politicians' job finding the resources for what we've decided we need.</p> <p>Perhaps I can offer one view why the essentially and unavoidably short-term outlook of politicians can no longer justify their taking decisions on education?</p> <p>I am absolutely certain that a large number of the young people in our schools will be doing jobs in their lives that we, their heads, have never even heard or dreamt of.</p> <p>Can I remind you of the Hebrew proverb which states that we must educate young people for the world they will inhabit, not for the one we their elders used to live in. The pace of change we have seen in our lives is staggering. </p> <p>In 1985 a silicon micro chip cost \u00a31,000. In 1997 it cost \u00a32.50. In 1999 it was so cheap that factories set up months before were closing.</p> <p>It took 40 years for there to be 50 million listeners to radio. It took the internet four years to gain that many users.</p> <p>If we take the rate of change in IT and apply it to cars we would now be getting 85,000 miles to a tank of petrol, a car would cost \u00a330. And be 2 * inches long.</p> <p>Is it fair to ask the politician to undertake the deep, long-term thinking about education that we need when the only certainty is frantic change? Is it physically possible for those who in all honesty must make their priority time that which they spend with those who elect them to do so?</p> <p>I'm not a great fan of themed conferences, but in entitling this one '10 Years On' I hope I've made a small start to looking ahead into what the next 10 years might hold and more importantly what they should hold for us all. I have quoted from WB Yeats earlier. Perhaps I can share one of his last poems with you - 'What Then?'</p> <p>'His chosen comrades thought at school <br> He must grow a famous man; <br> He thought the same, and lived by rule, <br> All his twenties crammed with toil; <br> 'What then?' sang Plato's ghost. 'What then?'</p> <p>Everything he wrote was read, <br> After certain years he won <br> Sufficient money for his need, <br> Friends that have been friends indeed; <br> 'What then?' sang Plato's ghost. 'What then?'</p> <p>All his happier dreams came true - <br> A small old house, wife, daughter, son, <br> Grounds where plum and cabbage grew, <br> Poets and Wits about him drew; <br> 'What then?' sang Plato's ghost. 'What then?'</p> <p>'The work is done,' grown old he thought, <br> 'According to my boyish plan; <br> Let the fools rage, I swerved in naught, <br> Something to perfection brought'. <br> 'What then?' sang Plato's ghost. 'What then?'</p> <p>Edward Thring had a vision when he founded this conference. I hope he would think that at times and in various places we have 'something to perfection brought'. Yet I hope those achievements never breed complacency in us, and that most of all we echo Plato's ghost in asking ourselves at all times and in all places, \"What then? What then?'</p> <p>And from the sublime to... the even more sublime. Only one person has ever been more surprised to be elected chairman of HMC. He's called John Cleese, he's an actor in the film Clockwise and the difference between us is that he acted his surprise and mine is real.</p> <p>This past year has been a real privilege, one of the greatest in my life as it happens. I've met a lot of superb heads, been invited into staggeringly impressive schools. I'd like my last word to be the magic word we all describe to our children. Thank you, for electing me as your chairman. It's been a wonderful privilege and a quite extraordinarily rewarding experience.</p> <p>Thank you.</p>",
  "<p>Oliver Letwin today took the \"courageous\" decision not to tell the Conservative conference where he would cut taxes - but insisted he would freeze civil service recruitment and scrap local government targets within days of taking office.</p> <p>Speaking to delegates in Bournemouth without notes or a script, the shadow chancellor said the easiest thing in the world to do would be to say \"I promise to cut taxes on such and such by so much on such a day\".</p> <p>But he received a standing ovation for instead merely promising that his first budget \"would set Britain on the path to being a low-tax economy\".</p> <p>Instead, he warned that a Labour victory in the next election would mean \"third-term tax rises\", and refused to bow to pressure - from either the conference or the media - to spell out Tory tax cuts.</p> <p>He said: \"That would not be courageous at all. No one out there believes us [all politicians] at all.</p> <p>\"There have been too many broken promises - and the sad thing is we made promises on tax we couldn't keep.</p> <p>\"Instead of promises, action. On the first day, I will freeze civil service recruitment. In the first week I will lift controls on local government, abolish the dreadful best value and performance assessment regimes.</p> <p>\"In the first budget I will implement the James reforms [the Tory-commissioned troubleshooter identifying Whitehall savings] and set Britain on the path to a lower-tax economy.\"</p> <p>Telling grassroots Tory activists he won't reveal specific tax cuts ahead of a general election is a high-risk strategy, but Mr Letwin's 15-minute oratory was well-received in the hall.</p> <p><strong>Deregulation</strong><br></p> <p>Speaking directly after Mr Letwin, the newly promoted shadow secretary of state for deregulation, John Redwood, demanded that in future civil servants would have to suggest existing laws which could be scrapped before suggesting any new legislation.</p> <p>He also pledged to bring in a \"great deregulation bill\" within a year of taking office, and to draw up a list of \"unwanted EU regulations\" to take to Brussels as part of a renegotiation of Britain's membership.</p> <p>Mr Redwood also received a standing ovation. </p> <p>The preceding debate heard from Mary Wight, a bookkeeper from Tunbridge wells, who called for an end to the burden of EU-inspired red tape and Whitehall regulations that serve to \"frustrate our beleaguered employers\" and was throwing natural Tory voters into the arms of Ukip. </p> <p>She said she had 40 small businesses on her books, many of which were being strangled by complicated VAT rules. \"More than 10% of my clients have admitted to me they voted for Ukip,\" she told Tory activists. \"Most of them were Tory voters. We need to regain their trust.\"</p> <p>The prospective parliamentary candidate for Dewsbury, Sayeeda Wasi, spoke of how her father's manufacturing business was failing because of increased regulation and burdens from central government. </p> <p>\"The rate of return is failing and the country is now facing the worst trade deficit since records began,\" she said. </p> <p>\"So what's up? Regulation. Fifteen new regulations for every working day of this government ... New Labour is not fit to run businesses in this country and it is certainly not fit to run this country anymore.\" </p> <p><strong>'Unfair' tax system</strong><br></p> <p>Earlier, in a briefing to journalists, Mr Letwin identified five areas of the tax system he regards as unfair: council tax, inheritance tax, stamp duty, income tax thresholds, and pensions means-testing.</p> <p>He identified a further three areas - capital gains tax, the taxation of small businesses and environmental taxes - as overcomplicated.</p> <p>In a fringe meeting speech on Wednesday, Mr Letwin will argue that there is a moral case for lowering the burden of tax: \"There is something morally wrong with taking people's money when all that the money is doing is to pay for unnecessary or counterproductive increases in the size of government\".</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats were quick to rebut Mr Letwin's plans. The Lib Dems' Treasury spokesman, Vincent Cable, said: \"Mr Letwin's tax cutting agenda, announced today, is a last ditch attempt to gain support but no indication has been given on how these will be implemented and funded.</p> <p>\"Not all commitments can be met by cutting 'waste' and there is a growing sense of 'miracle fatigue' amongst the general public on how far 'waste' money can go.\"</p>",
  "Political blogs are all the rage. Politicians fondly imagine a blog will allow them to speak directly to the voters, without their words being distorted by the media prism. Every politician has to have one. <p>This is not, strictly speaking, a \"blog\". It's more of a \"clog\". A political column, published fortnightly, which will record my trials and tribulations as a Tory candidate as the next election approaches. Here goes.</p> <p>My name is Ed Vaizey, and I am the Tory candidate for the Wantage constituency, a huge area covering a substantial part of the Vale of White Horse and South Oxfordshire. </p> <p>Wantage is represented by Robert Jackson, a Conservative MP. Labour are in second place. I have known Robert for many years, since he was higher education minister, and I like him enormously. He is formidably bright, a fellow of All Souls and, all too rare these days, a free thinker. His positions on tuition fees, the David Kelly affair (David Kelly lived in the constituency) and Europe sometimes put him at odds with the Conservative party.</p> <p>To have a strong relationship with the sitting MP is vital if you are a candidate. There can be no better person to introduce you to the day-to-day life of a constituency MP. To have the chance to work closely with Robert has made a real difference to my time as a candidate.</p> <p>The first question most people ask when they meet me is \"How did you get selected?\" Depending on which word in that sentence they emphasise, the question is either one of incredulity or one of general enquiry.</p> <p>The selection process is a gruelling one. Like university finals, the whole experience is strangely enjoyable until it is over. And then you think - I'd never do that again. Almost 200 people applied to be the candidate for Wantage. The initial shortlist was 18 people, who were interviewed over a weekend by a selection panel. Then a shortlist of 8 was interviewed by an executive committee. And a final shortlist of four then appears before the whole Association membership. There are over a 1000 members of the Association, and about 200 turned up for the final vote. Each candidate made a short speech and then answered questions.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to win the selection on the first ballot. (Interestingly for students of electoral systems, the Conservative party operates a single transferable vote system in its candidate selection system, not a first past the post system.) I had wanted to be the candidate for Wantage for ages, and I think my enthusiasm showed through. As a teenager, I grew up nearby in Berkshire and went to university in Oxford and I know the area very well. (The constituency was originally in Berkshire and some people still refer to the area as occupied North Berkshire.)</p> <p>I've been the candidate for almost two years now. It's a very odd job, being a parliamentary candidate. I sometimes describe it as the longest job interview in the world. There is no job description, you have no specific role and no specific responsibilities. So you have to invent them for yourself.</p> <p>In fact, it's a huge opportunity. You get involved in a huge range of issues. You meet hundreds of people and dozens of groups. You learn the job before doing the job. There is no plan, no set timetable. I just go to whatever I can, wherever it is, meet people, talk to them and listen to them.</p> <p>The tricky problem for every parliamentary candidate is how to describe yourself. Before electoral law was relaxed, your technical title was \"prospective parliamentary candidate\", or PPC. The \"prospective\" bit was necessary because, until you were officially adopted (usually just after the election was called) you were not the official candidate.</p> <p>People soon realised that PPC meant nothing to most people. So candidates took to calling themselves \"parliamentary spokesman\", which is what I normally use. Now that electoral law has been relaxed, some candidates are even more forthright. The Labour candidate calls himself \"your next MP\", which makes up in boldness what it lacks in humility.</p> <p>My local papers almost always refer to me as \"the Conservative candidate for the Wantage constituency who hopes to succeed Robert Jackson at the next election\". It's a bit of a mouthful. But it sums it up very nicely.</p>",
  "<p>If Tony Robinson is short of ideas for his new TV series The Worst Jobs in History, can I suggest the job I had to do 10 years ago? Official Tory observer at the Labour party conference. For a whole week in Blackpool, I walked around wearing the equivalent of a leper's bell - a pass that said I was from the Conservative party.</p> <p>It wasn't just any conference either. This was Tony Blair's first conference as Labour leader, the one where he ditched Clause 4 and where \"New Labour\" made its first appearance. Here was a party bristling with self-confidence, disciplined, energetic, full of ideas, with a young leader who promised a new kind of politics and a new political era; while there was I, a junior researcher, representing a tired and divided government that had been in office since I was seven years old and had run out of things to say.</p> <p>Last week I went back to the Labour conference, this time to give a speech as an opposition spokesman at a fringe meeting. Brighton town centre looked a bit like a provincial North Korean city, with colourful posters on every lamppost proclaiming \"A better life for all\". But no one believed it. </p> <p>The Labour party I found there was unrecognisable to the one I encountered 10 years ago. Exhausted, uncertain of its legacy, unsure of its future direction, bitterly divided - one could feel the passing of a political era even before Blair fired the starting gun on the race for his successor. As I travelled back to London on the train I thought, for the first time in my short political lifetime: \"We can win this, we really can.\" </p> <p>Yet as we Conservatives gather here in Bournemouth, I still find an air of self-doubt. Hartlepool hasn't helped, of course. If there are two words that can unnerve the Tory heartlands, they're \"LibDems\" and \"Ukip\" - but I am not sure they should. The big question for the Liberals is not why are they doing well but why aren't they doing much better. If ever a third party was going to make a breakthrough, it would have been over the past five years. Instead, they hover in the low 20s in the opinion polls, came fourth in the European elections and face a looming chasm between the traditional sandal brigade and the neo-liberals who want to dismantle the NHS. </p> <p>As for Ukip, for all the Kilroy-Silk inspired hype, they have no prospect of winning a single parliamentary seat. I believe we can persuade these voters in a well-targeted cam paign that the next Conservative government would bring powers back from Brussels without letting the European issue dominate our main election message. </p> <p> W hat should that message be? We certainly don't lack ideas. In fact, quite unusually for an opposition, we've been setting the philosophical agenda for some time. Take choice in the public services. Patient and parental power as a mechanism for improving standards was once derided by Labour ministers, but no prime ministerial speech is now complete without the buzzword of \"choice\". Or take waste and inefficiency in Whitehall. When we started talking about it, Gordon Brown accused us of talking down the public sector. Now he tries to outbid us with claims about the number of civil servants he's going to sack. Or even take tax. We've been saying taxes are too high and should be reduced. Who noticed tucked away in Blair's speech last week the promise of \"tax relief for the millions of hard-working families\"? Get ready for a tax-cutting gimmick in the pre-election budget. </p> <p>Conservatives have been winning the battle of ideas but, partly because of Blair's chameleon qualities, we've struggled to create a distinctive identity for ourselves. The public look at us and asks: \"Are you any different from the other lot?\" And because they're so disillusioned with Labour, we've got to persuade them that we are different if we want to win their votes. To do that we certainly mustn't abandon the centre ground in the search for mythical clear blue water - we've already got the right ideas on pensions, crime, education, childcare, health, tax and all the other areas that top most people's list of concerns. </p> <p>Nor do we need some new-fangled packaging to set us apart. A succession of Tory leaders have tried to find a rhetorical answer to Blair and failed. Indeed, the one thing the public has had enough of from this government is talk. What they want to see is action. We should recognise that and respond. We should do what political parties almost never do. We should avoid the overblown statements and tub-thumping oratory. We should downplay our rhetoric and cut the talk about building a new Jerusalem. </p> <p>Instead, let's set out clearly and simply what we want to achieve. Michael Howard should tell people exactly how we could help them on day one, week one and year one of a Conservative government. He should be positive, practical and realistic about what we can and cannot do. He shouldn't promise the earth, just what he can deliver and be held accountable for. This week in Bournemouth, Michael should play to his strengths and be the antidote to the Blair era I saw emerge in Blackpool 10 years ago. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> George Osborne is Conservative MP for Tatton and shadow chief secretary to the Treasury</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:contact@georgeosborne.co.uk\">contact@georgeosborne.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The conservative party chairman Liam Fox today made an appeal to Ukip supporters with a pledge to hold a referendum on the EU constitution within four months of forming a government. <p>In his opening address to the party conference in Bournemouth, Dr Fox pledged that if there is a May election next year, the Tories will hold a snap EU referendum before the party's conference in September.</p> <p>But he denied the Tories were committing a \"lurch to the right\" as he pledged that a Michael Howard government would be tough on crime, asylum, defence and taxation.</p> <p><b>Centre or right?</b></p> <p>The dilemma of how to woo back Ukip supporters while appealing to the political centre dominated the conference fringe this lunchtime, with senior Conservatives offering different solutions to the problem.</p> <p>Speaking at the Times fringe meeting, the shadow home secretary, David Davis, conceded that the anti-EU party could cost the Tories up to 30 to 50 seats at the general election, as the Referendum party did in 1997. </p> <p>And he hinted that the party would increasingly focus on its traditionally strong issues - crime and immigration - in the run-up to the election.</p> <p>\"There's no lurch to the right in the Tory party,\" he said. \"But there may be a shift in the public in the issues they care about. If crime and immigration have become more salient that's because they are the issues they [the public] care about.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We must get the country to buy its conservatism from the Conservatives.\"</p> <p>The Conservatives' policy coordinator and leading moderniser, David Cameron, however, warned the party not to \"search for ever more deep blue water in which to drown ourselves\".</p> <p>Speaking at the Independent's fringe, Mr Cameron said: \"We don't win by a fruitless search for difference between ourselves and our opponents. That doesn't work. It's Punch &amp; Judy. And we don't win by taking one subject and talking about it incessantly.\"</p> <p>With Mr Cameron seated beside the party's most well known Eurosceptic, John Redwood, few in the audience doubted that that was an implicit reference to Europe.</p> <p>In contrast, Mr Redwood said that the Conservative party would only win the next election by \"being Conservative and being proud of it\".</p> <p>Before launching an assault on Ukip, he insisted that the \"first thing [we should do] in power is get control of our borders\".</p> <p><b>Attack on Labour</b></p> <p>Addressing the conference before Mr Redwood this morning, Dr Fox concentrated his fire on Tony Blair, accusing him of \"moral vanity\" in refusing to admit mistakes, and taking \"five summer holiday freebies\".</p> <p>Ridiculing press comparisons of Mr Blair to Margaret Thatcher, Dr Fox paraphrased a famous US campaign soundbite to tell delegates: \"We know Margaret Thatcher, we worked with Margaret Thatcher - Mr Blair, you're no Margaret Thatcher.\"</p> <p>He then went onto to borrow an electioneering phrase of Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, telling delegates: \"If you believe that the first duty of government is defence of this country, then you are a conservative.</p> <p>\"If you believe that you should keep more of your own hard-earned income, then you are a conservative.</p> <p>\"If you believe that those who save for themselves and their families should be rewarded, not penalised, then you are a conservative.\"</p> <p>Dr Fox attacked the Lib Dems as a \"party that likes to get high - high on taxes but low on integrity\".</p> <p>He said: \"They want to ban smoking - but legalise soft drugs.\"</p> <p><b>Europe</b><br></p> <p>The major new policy announcement in the speech, however, came on Europe, with Dr Fox revealing: \"If we win an election in May we will hold a referendum before we meet at next year's party conference - a pledge that only the Conservative party can deliver. We will campaign for a No vote. And we will get a No vote.\"</p> <p>But he declared this year's Bournemouth conference would be their \"last in opposition\".</p> <p>Yet he made a gaffe within three paragraphs of opening his speech, telling delegates that \"we triumphed in the London assembly with our best performance since the early 90s\". In fact, the devolved London assembly was only created in 2000.</p> <p>His pep talk speech came as a poll in the Times showed that only 37% of voters think taxes would be lower under the Conservatives.</p> <p>Dr Fox also conceded that Michael Howard was \"not always the easiest person to work with\" - before adding: \"He knows what he thinks and what he believes in. He likes a good argument.\"</p> <p>He also reclaimed the red, white and blue of the new Tory logo, saying: \"We will never surrender the colours of our flag to those on the dangerous fringe of British politics. We are the party of all Britain and all Britons.\"</p>",

Magnier and McManus' Cubic Expression company owns 29% of the club and it remains to be seen if Glazer is prepared to meet their shares asking price.</p> <p>An alternative way for Glazer to raise funds for a takeover deal would be through securitisation deals, effectively a way of mortgaging against future season-ticket sales and revenue streams. </p> <p>Glazer has a 19.2% stake in United and financial expert Keith Harris believes he would be wise to proceed with caution in any attempt to take over the club. </p> <p>To increase his stake Glazer would need to acquire shares owned by Magnier and McManus and Harris, who was involved in the negotiations which transformed United's rivals Chelsea with the arrival of Russian owner Roman Abramovich, warned the most obvious winners in any deal are likely to be the astute Magnier and McManus. </p> <p>\"It is hard to tell if it looks like a very good investment for anybody other than the Irishmen who - if they sell - would look very smart indeed,\" said Harris, of the racing businessmen who are expected to hold out for extra profits on the share price. </p> <p>\"He would have to buy them out to take control. I don't know if they would be interested, but they are known as very smart investors.\"</p> <p>Harris also sees a potential problem for 75-year-old Glazer in the reticence of United's supporter shareholders to welcome more money from a man who already owns around a \u00a3140m interest in their club. </p> <p>\"I think there is one other quite big obstacle, and that is not just the hearts but the pockets of the fans who are shareholders,\" he said. \"Buying out the Irishmen is a financial matter. But with the fans it is something more than that.\"</p> <p>That much is irrefutable. Despite the riches that Glazer might bring, his approach is not be popular with the hardcore United support, who launched a furious counter-offensive when Rupert Murdoch launched his ultimately unsuccessful bid to buy the club six years ago, and who feel such a bid would strip the club of its identity.</p> <p>\"If Glazer wants a fight, we'll give him one,\" said Jules Spencer of the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association. \"We sent Murdoch packing and gave [John] Magnier and [JP] McManus a bloody nose. We want to make it clear that he is not welcome or wanted as owner of Manchester United.\"</p>",
  "<p>Matt Groening, the man who created the Simpsons, has news that will make the Channel 4 executives who recently invested millions in bringing the dysfunctional cartoon family to the channel breathe a large sigh of relief. </p> <p>The 50-year-old, who embodies the same mix of cynicism and na\u00efve enthusiasm that make his characters globally famous, insists that as the show enters its 16th season in US, his passion for it remains undimmed. \"A few years ago I thought, well, we've got to run out of steam soon and that we'd be done by now. We're not, in fact we're going full steam ahead.\" </p> <p>While he admits that for a time he felt that the iconic show was winding down, he now believes it will run and run, perhaps to the end of the decade. And beyond that plans for a Simpsons movie are well under way: \"We're trying to tell a story that we wouldn't do on television and take advantage of a longer process and a more ambitious process for animation,\" says Groening, who looks uncannily like a live version of a character from Springfield, the fictional town where the show is set. </p> <p>\"Everyone on the show this year seems really re-energised and we're starting to throw out ideas for the movie and I think that will either kill the show or completely re-invigorate it,\" adds Groening, who first sketched the characters 17 years ago to fill a short slot in the Tracey Ullman show. </p> <p>From those humble beginnings, over the course of more than 330 episodes its cultural impact, not to mention its effect on the bottom line of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, is hard to overestimate. It makes its parent network Fox around \u00a31.4bn a year in syndication fees, is watched in over 90 countries and in the process has become the most analysed and deconstructed TV show in history. </p> <p>The bad news for its millions of fans around the world is that it looks like the end is in sight. The overall impression from a day spent with some of the sprawling team of producers, writers, animators and voice talent that make the show is that the goal is to reach 20 seasons, which would take it to 2009 in the States. The series would then overtake Gunsmoke as the longest running entertainment show on US television with its place in history assured. </p> <p>Groening admits that it gets harder with each series to come up with something new. \"It's not a machine, it's a bunch of humans working really hard,\" he says. \"It doesn't get easier because we're still faced with the problem of having a history. We're trying not to repeat ourselves and we're also competing with people's memories of their favourite episode.\" </p> <p>Yeardley Smith, the voice of eight-year-old child prodigy Lisa Simpson, admits that bringing the curtain down on the show would be a huge wrench. \"I would hope that the writers would pull the plug while we're still at the top of our game so we can go out with a bang instead of a piffle in terms of quality and stuff,\" she says in a high pitched voice that often veers disconcertingly into that of her character. </p> <p>Behind the scenes it's been a tense summer at the Fox Studios lot where the Simpsons team meet daily to throw ideas around in a building that was formerly the bungalow of another American icon, Marilyn Monroe. In a development that is becoming increasingly familiar in Hollywood the actors who provide the show's voices went on strike to demand more pay, finally settling for a \u00a34m a year deal. Their new contracts run for four more years, taking the cast to series 19. </p> <p>Channel 4, which will start airing the show in November with a themed night of programming devoted to The Simpsons, is expecting an immediate ratings boost but also hopes it will remain a schedule fixture for years. Under the deal, it keeps getting episodes as long as new ones are being made. While Sky One retains the rights to screen the show first, Channel 4 can show episodes new to terrestrial TV from series 12 onwards and batches of repeats. It snatched the show from the BBC following a ferocious bidding war two years ago, when it beat the corporation and Five to bag the rights in a deal worth an estimated \u00a3700,000 per episode. One of the reasons they were so keenly fought over was that repeats consistently get as many viewers as new episodes, bringing over three million viewers to BBC2 at teatime. </p> <p>Such is the multi-layered nature of the comedy and the care that goes into each episode, which take nine months to make it from script to screen, that it bears up well to repeat viewing. C4's head of acquisitions, June Dromgoole, who was responsible for buying The Simpsons when she worked at the BBC, says she agreed to pay so much because of its timeless quality. </p> <p>\"It's a unique series. They've managed to keep it fresh over all these years. At some point in Friends, they get old and move on. In Frasier, Niles and Daphne have to get married; but The Simpsons is different.\" </p> <p>Another reason for her confidence is that the show appeals equally to adults and children and, importantly, to the 16-34 audience that represents Channel 4's holy grail in terms of ad revenue. A typical episode could parody Hitchcock, reference Bauhaus architecture and still provide plenty of visual humour and pratfalls. </p> <p>\"Three obscure jokes in an episode is awesome. But you still need the money shot of Homer getting his head stuck in a toilet or whatever. That's what pays the bills,\" explains Matt Selman, one of a team of between 18 and 20 writers on the show. </p> <p>Channel 4 plans to capitalise on this cross-generational appeal by screening the new shows in a prime time slot, probably on a Friday night. Repeat episodes are likely to be scattered throughout the week. In contrast, the BBC played the show at 6pm on BBC2, putting it beyond reach of many adult viewers. </p> <p>For the team of sharp, snappy, preppy writers who work on the show, some of whom were younger than Bart when the series began, the form gives them enormous freedom. Unlike in live action, the characters never get old and stories can be set anywhere from their front garden to outer space. One show in the series that Channel 4 will air first, for example, features the Simpsons re-cast as characters from American history. </p> <p>\"I look at the show like the movie Groundhog Day. Every day nothing ever happened before and it's a clean slate. A different crazy thing happens and it all goes back to a clean slate,\" says Selman, who has worked on more than 100 episodes. Another writer, Ian Maxtone-Graham, also points out that as the show has developed, other characters in the Springfield universe have progressively become more rounded and given bigger parts. </p> <p>Part of the series' genius is the way in which it retains this timeless quality, while still being able to poke fun at contemporary American culture. \"We try to pick up on big trends rather than what literally happened yesterday. You try to use what is happening in the world in the big picture to tell universal, timeless stories in funny, new, creative, inspired ways,\" explains Selman. </p> <p>If the cartoon appears to have lost its subversive edge since the days when George Bush Snr famously declared it a threat to American family values, Groening says that it's not through lack of trying. \"I think we still offend people. American culture is full of people lining up to pretend that something bothers them. But they've learned that they look like idiots when they do so, so they've stopped doing it,\" he believes. </p> <p>Groening is from the \"liberal side\" of the political spectrum. As, it seems, are most of the cast and crew. \"We're all going to vote for the same presidential candidate. But we take shots at both sides. We really haven't slammed George Bush as much as we have slammed Clinton. Maybe we feel sort of guilty,\" says Carolyn Omine, the only female writer on the show. </p> <p>It is precisely this fiercely protected editorial independence that makes the show ideal for Channel 4, argues Dromgoole. \"The attitude of the Simpsons is very akin to the attitude of the channel - edgy and irreverent,\" she says. And the Simpsons' enormous success, which has given the writers almost unprecedented freedom from network control, also offers them the opportunity to rib their paymasters. </p> <p>\"We've poked fun at Rupert Murdoch a number of times and some of the executives are worried about it, although Rupert himself seems to be very good natured. He played himself as 'evil billionaire tyrant Rupert Murdoch' and good for him. Of course, if I was in his position I would laugh about it too,\" chuckles Groening. </p> <p>Groening argues that the US president has become such an easy target for comedians that to attack him in obvious ways is plain lazy. \"It's really difficult to be politically satirical and not just pick on easy targets. So we try to do it in a fairly subtle way. Sometimes, what The Simpsons does is take a point of view that is the opposite of what we believe, exaggerate it to the point of ridiculousness and hope people get it,\" he says. But he also promises Bush a rough ride if he wins in November: \"We'll do a lot more if he is re-elected\". </p> <p>And while it's true that the Simpsons have become as familiar to some viewers as their own family and, as such, have lost their power to shock, those who work on the show believe that it represents a victory of sorts. \"If we're now part of the establishment, I hope we've changed it for the better,\" says Jean. </p> <p>For Groening, the goal remains to maintain the consistently high standards the show has achieved. \"You tend to remember the things that were funnier when you saw them first time. It's harder. You've seen so much that it's harder to be surprising. But we're trying.\" </p> <p>In the show, Homer once told Lisa: \"You tried your best and failed miserably. The lesson is 'never try'\". Everyone from Channel 4 chief executive Andy Duncan to Murdoch and millions of viewers will be hoping that Groening continues to disregard the advice of his greatest comic creation.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown is a man in a hurry. There is, he says, not a moment to be lost if the global community is to have a chance of hitting its millennium development goals by 2015. Indeed, the way things are going, even by 2115 the number of people living in poverty will not have been halved; there will still not be universal primary education, and infant mortality will not have been cut by two-thirds. </p> <p>The chancellor says 150 years is too long to wait and he's right. He says there is a need for urgent action to tackle the \"tragedy of poverty\", the \"needless deaths\", the \"challenges\" of debt relief and the \"scandal\" of HIV/Aids, and he's right about all that too. </p> <p>But getting the global community to budge is as difficult as persuading prime ministers to shift their stuff out of Downing Street. Brown loses no opportunity to press other countries for action and says he is making progress. But meetings of the International Monetary Fund in Washington have their own rhythm, and that rhythm is slow. No, make that glacially slow. </p> <p>Here's the position as the British government sees it. The world's poorest countries don't have the remotest possibility of growing fast enough to eradicate poverty without additional resources. Debt relief has not been nearly deep enough, so the scheme pieced together at the end of the 90s needs to be revisited and improved. In addition, the fragile economies of sub-Saharan Africa need a doubling of development assistance to provide the capital that will allow them to put in place the building blocks of a modern state - schools, hospitals, roads, power, telecommunications. </p> <p>The money comes with strings attached. There have to be mechanisms in place to ensure the cash is not blown on arms or siphoned off by corrupt politicians, but the conditions placed on poor countries should be made smarter and less onerous. A paper presented to this weekend's meeting by the international development secretary, Hilary Benn, called on the World Bank to undertake a \"major review\" of its approach to conditionality, particularly in the sensitive areas of economic policy, such as privatisation and trade liberalisation. All utterly sensible. </p> <p>And yet, the legacy of what should be old battles lingers on. At the weekend, the IMF was involved in a spat with Oxfam and VSO over a report that said the fund's insistence on a budget ceiling meant 8,000-9,000 qualified teachers sit unemployed in Zambia even though there is scant chance of the country meeting the development goal of putting every child in school by 2015. The fund said the problem was that the Zambian government had agreed to excessive pay rises which threatened to add to the already serious inflation problem. </p> <p>The exchange disguised the fundamental problem. Developing countries need extra resources both to recruit and retain extra staff, but don't have the necessary cash available. Where debt relief has been channelled into health and education, the results have been good. It hasn't been squandered as the sceptics thought it would be, but has delivered real benefits. In Benin, 43% of debt relief granted under the highly indebted poor country initiative went to education in 2002, allowing for the hiring of teachers in rural areas, while a further 54% went to health and was used for rural clinics, HIV/Aids and anti-malarial programmes, improving access to safe water and immunisation. </p> <p>Debt relief works, but there hasn't been enough of it. As the chancellor noted at the weekend, only 50% of the money owed to the main multilateral lending institutions - the IMF, the World Bank and the African Development Bank - has been written off. A joint paper from Action Aid, Cafod and Oxfam calculated that even after debt relief under the HIPC scheme only seven countries had seen their debt burden reduced to levels considered \"sustainable\". Ghana spends more on repaying debt than it does on health; Zambia devotes more money to its creditors than it does to its education sector. </p> <p>Gerald Sendaula, Uganda's finance minister, said his country - one of the best performers in Africa over the past decade or more - had been badly hit by the collapse of world coffee prices. Uganda, he said, needed help if it was to hit the development goals. </p> <p>Brown's plan would certainly increase the flow of funds into poor countries. As far as debt relief is concerned, he wants a 100% write-off of multilateral debts, paid for in part by the sale or revaluation of the IMF's enormous gold reserves and in part by greater generosity on the part of creditor countries. Britain has said it will pay 10% of the debts owed by poor countries to the World Bank and the African Development Bank as they fall due each year, and is challenging other countries to follow suit. The doubling of aid to $100bn that Brown wants to see would come from the International Finance Facility, which would see money raised from the sale of bonds in the world's capital markets. These would in effect front-load development assistance, since the bonds would be paid back from aid budgets after 2015. </p> <p>Selling off the IMF's gold is seen by Brown and his team as a free lunch. The Fund is sitting on about 100m ounces of gold, which is valued at about one-eighth of its market value. As an organisation, the fund does not need the gold and could make more money by investing the proceeds from a sale into better performing assets. There was a suggestion a quarter of a century ago to scale down the fund's holding, which was rejected. That decision has cost about \u00a330bn in lost income. Sales of up to 5m ounces of IMF gold a year would allow 100% debt relief for its debtors. An alternative to outright sales would be to revalue the gold on the fund's books, a mechanism the IMF has used before to raise resources. Given the choice, Brown would prefer the first option but would happily settle for the second.</p> <p>One objection to the gold plan is that sales might depress the world price and thus affect the income of developing countries which mine the metal. Brown's proposal would see any gold transactions taking place off-market so that there was no effect on the price. In any case, the evidence of the past few years is that sales of gold by the UK and other countries have not depressed the price.</p> <p>In reality, the problem is not one of feasibility, nor of the impact on the gold price, nor even of the other old chestnut - that writing-off debt simply encourages countries to behave badly again in the future. The problem is one of politics. Commendably, Brown has put a lot of effort into pushing his proposals at each and every meeting of the IMF and the G7 but he is facing strong resistance from a US administration which has yet to be convinced of the need for extra resources, wants to keep control over its own spending programmes, and believes any plan to sell IMF gold or for American taxpayers to pay off the multilateral debts of poor countries would be rejected by Congress.</p> <p>As a result, Brown was able to announce plenty of studies at the weekend: he could promise a quiverful of feasibility reports and a truckful of work in progress. What he could not promise was any extra dosh in the here and now. There is now no chance of a new debt-relief plan until next year at the earliest, and Brown is aware that Britain's presidency of the G8 in 2005 is vital. But, as he himself noted, there are 30,000 preventable deaths in developing countries each day. There are about 200 days to the next meeting of the IMF in the spring. You do the maths.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>\"Oh, they're like Keane!\" squeals a friend. Outrageous as the comparison seems, the dusky melancholy of the Furries' opening number does, at a stretch, evoke those wishy-washy balladeers. Only for a moment, though - then a pair of trumpeters in monks' habits chirp a salutation that sounds like kick-off at a New Orleans funeral, as lava lamp squiggles drift across a big screen. </p> <p>Singer Gruff Rhys, who will later don a space helmet, is mumbling a ditty called Demons. In the audience, jaws are slackening as the music turns into a synapse-frying drone. All of this happens in the first five minutes, and there's two hours to go. </p> <p>Having proved that they barely inhabit the same universe as Keane, the Welsh psychedelic quintet spend the first half of the evening (the show is divided into segments featuring hypnotic slowies and rockers, with an interval to check that your brain is still ticking over) transfixing the crowd. It's impressive to watch entire rows of seated adults rock forward from the waist until their heads graze their knees. </p> <p>The band are plugging a best-of called Songbook, which compiles the woolliest moments of their six previous albums. Much of what's played during the first half, though, seems to be chosen at whim: a blissful lullaby sung in Welsh; the painfully beautiful Turning Tide, with a bit of classical flavour added by violin-playing monks. </p> <p>Part two goes with a jolt, starting with the deceptively titled Slow Life. Rhys winches on his helmet, waves a sort of light sabre, and the volume is ratcheted up. Rings Around the World and Golden Retriever exemplify the Celtic trait of wresting melody out of guitar rock. There's a large mirror behind the band, giving the impression of a world beyond - just the sort of magical place that produces songs like the cascading God! Show Me Magic, and the dozen or so that follow. May their magic remain potent.</p>",
  "<p>The man who helped mastermind Chris Evans TV and radio career is plotting an audacious bid to buy back Virgin Radio, the rock station that sacked the star two years ago following a notorious binge.</p> <p>Showbusiness agent Michael Foster, who still represents Evans, is attempting to put together a consortium of investors to try to buy back Virgin from Scottish Media Group, which acquired the station almost five years ago.</p> <p>The move heralds the prospect of Evans making a comeback at Virgin Radio - he still owns 10 million shares in SMG and if his old friend Mr Foster found himself in control of the station he could be tempted to return.</p> <p>However, Evans, who was sacked as Virgin's breakfast host two years ago after failing to show up for work for six days, is not involved in the bid.</p> <p>Mr Foster, 46, is working with a City bank on the financing plan although it is not clear whether any institution or other investors are yet on board.</p> <p>It is believed he has valued the business at about \u00a3100m - far short of the \u00a3140m-\u00a3150m price tag the City believes SMG would demand. SMG acquired the station for \u00a3225m, which many now believe was too much for a station that outside of London can only be heard on crackly medium wave.</p> <p>SMG has consistently said it is not selling Virgin Radio and earlier this year denied reports it had drawn up a sale plan for the station.</p> <p>However, there is a perception in the City that SMG is a break-up target and that given the right price the company would sell.</p> <p>Radio experts also believe that Virgin Radio is underperforming - when SMG took it over in January 2000 it had 3.7 million listeners, now it has just 2.6 million with the London FM station falling below the psychologically important 1 million barrier.</p> <p>Sources have confirmed that Foster is trying to put a consortium together and that he believes the station is under performing.</p> <p>Mr Foster's career is closely entwined with that of Evans - as his agent he helped forge the star's radio and TV career from the early 1990s when Evans was a rising star on Channel 4's The Big Breakfast.</p> <p>As the time Mr Foster was one of the most well-known showbusiness agents in the business as co-chairman of the ICM agency - which represented the likes of Liz Hurley.</p> <p>Then seven years ago, he quit to join Evans as the chief executive of Ginger TV, following Ginger's \u00a387m deal to buy Virgin Radio. But he left nine months later in acrimonious circumstances, pocketing a \u00a31.1m payoff in the process.</p> <p>Mr Foster resurfaced at Carlton in late 1999, lured by another close friend, Lord Waheed Alli, who at that time was managing director of Carlton Productions. </p> <p>He now runs his own agency, Artists' Rights Group, with agent Sue Latimer, and between them they represent leading names including Ross Kemp, Jimmy Nesbitt and Jamie Theakston.</p> <p>Virgin Radio is seen as vulnerable to a takeover as the industry consolidates and looks to a digital future that will see dozens of competitors to its rock format.</p> <p>\"The problem with Virgin now is that it is king of rock in an analogue world, but in the digital environment there are at least 10 other stations like Kerrang! and Q that are competing for its listeners,\" said one long-standing radio executive.</p> <p>If he can put a deal together to buy Virgin, Mr Foster will be reunited with the station founded by Sir Richard Branson 11 years ago.</p> <p>He helped Evans put the deal together to buy the station from Sir Richard in 1997, when it was sold for \u00a385m.</p> <p>SMG has blamed radio ratings body Rajar's research methods for the recent decline in its audience, which it claimed adversely affected advertising sales during the first six months of the year.</p> <p>Virgin Radio had a turnover of \u00a310.2m in the first six months of 2004 - a 13% decline from \u00a311.8m in the same period last year. </p> <p>The station's operating profits also fell, from \u00a33m to \u00a32.5m, a year on year drop of nearly 17%.</p> <p>The Virgin group still owns the rights to the Virgin Radio name and licenses it to SMG.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "As all aspiring young male politicians should know, there's a haircut that is a prerequisite to getting a job in the Treasury - the \"Gordon Brown weave\". If you've not got thick brown wavy hair capable of being brushed sideways and staying that way, then you've not got a chance. Ed Balls, until recently Gordon's most trusted aide, had the perfect Brown weave at the Progress \"Any Questions\" fringe. \"What's your greatest regret?\" asked an IPPR apparatchik. But the answers were lost as the entire panel, including Estelle Morris and Charlie Falconer, managed to avoid the question by simultaneously reaching for a boiled sweet. <p>Perhaps it was an ironic comment on the number of police drafted in to enforce security in Brighton, but the star guest at the Exhibitors Reception was Russell Floyd of The Bill. Despite this, and the promise of yet another hot buffet, there was no reason to stay and I was off to raid the fruit basket of the Health Hotel, where a stolen apple, alongside a slice of lemon in a gin and tonic, brought the fruit and veg count of the week to two. It seemed best to turn down the free health check on offer.</p> <p>At the IPPR media quiz, a team of print journalists were pitted against their broadcast counterparts for a 'who's the wittiest?' competition. Each team had an MP on side. \"David Lammy, can you tell us one interesting thing about the Channel Islands?\" asked Matthew Taylor, former IPPR director and now Downing Street supremo.</p> <p>Who was the wittiest? No idea - the Mirror party had started and it would be rude to waste the invite. But before long the free bar ended and Billy Bragg had already started singing at the piano in the bar of the Grand Hotel, a sure sign that it was time to go home. </p> <p>September 29: Partying at conference just isn't the same this year; you practically wear out the heels on your boots getting to all the bashes. First there was a sole-destroying walk to the Brighton Pier and the Prospect \"thinktank of the year\" party. Despite being held in a fish and chip shop, it was quiche and samosas all the way as the NLGN (what do you mean \"who?\") picked up the prize.</p> <p>Then there was a lengthy walk in the other direction to get to the Fabian bash, where a new staff team showed off all they had to offer. They dropped their \"invite only\" door policy when they realised few people would brave the walk when a glass of cheap Romanian white was all that was on offer. A member of staff was heard pleading into their mobile: \"Please bring friends, they don't need a security pass\".</p> <p>So the walking boots were pulled on again, and it was back to the safety of the security zone and the extremely exclusive Guardian party where the A-list guests were served by underage waiters agog at the amount that grown-ups can drink. It all got a bit messy when Gordon Brown walked in and a gaggle of swooning Guardian journalists (of both sexes) lined up, not all that decorously, to speak to him. At least that left a clear route to the bar to top up on Cava and then recline luxuriously on the sofa imported by the Guardian's events team, who weren't happy with the Metropole's own furniture.</p> <p> The Bloomberg party was less exclusive - they let anyone in, if you go in through the fire escape. No cabinet ministers here, but the small jacket potatoes with bits of sausage instead made it all worthwhile. \"Are they vegetarian?\" asked the representative from Prospect, poking a sausage, and clearly left hungry by the lack of fish and chips at their own party earlier.</p> <p>There was still time to catch the end of the Absolutely Equal party where Stephen Twigg and Ben Bradshaw, in time honoured tradition, took the prize for best dance routine to D:ream's Things Can Only Get Better. With the Mirror party still to come, that's more than likely.</p> <p>Meanwhile in the exhibition hall, the National Lottery stand attempts to sell tickets to passing politicians. And round the corner from the lottery are two separate stands calling for regime change in Tibet. The Free Tibet Campaign and the Tibet Society are separated by the Labour Action for Peace stand, though they assured me that they are happy to work together in their bid to bring back an absolute monarchy and theocray in the name of peace.</p>",

The teacher involved has been off work with a stress-related illness since the court case.</p> <p>Teachers have now been warned that the board will seek to dock their pay for time taken out of work for strike action. </p> <p>The NASUWT is highlighting the case to spearhead its campaign to secure greater protection for teachers against malicious allegations of assault made by pupils. </p> <p>Its acting general secretary, Chris Keates, said: \"The resolution we're looking for is a proper response from the board. If they conduct a proper risk assessment of the pupil, then we will consider that. The minimum we're looking for is an apology from the pupil and guarantee that the teacher will never have to teach her.</p> <p>\"Local education authorities throughout the UK should take note of the NASUWT action at Laurelhill Community College. NASUWT will address all such cases with vigour.\"</p> <p>Officials at the Department for Education and Skills are currently investigating whether a new approach can be made to malicious allegations, as promised in the government's five-year plan for education earlier this year. If new guidance which doesn't require new legislation is issued then all areas of the UK, regardless of their devolved status, will be required to take it up, Ms Keates said. </p> <p>There have been 1,907 members of NASUWT investigated by police following allegations of criminal abuse since records began 13 years ago - an average of 12 per month. Conviction has followed in fewer than 4% of these cases. There have been 92 cases in the first six months of this year with 30 cases closed and no convictions.</p> <p>The South Eastern Education and Library Board declined to comment this morning.</p>",
  "Oliver Letwin will today declare his mission to end \"fat government\" with a series of reforms of \"unfair and overcomplicated\" taxes - although he will stop short of making specific manifesto pledges. <p>In his afternoon address to the Bournemouth conference, the shadow chancellor will identify five \"unfair\" taxes, and three areas of taxation he regards as \"overly complicated\".</p> <p>Perhaps scarred by his off-the-cuff-pledge before the last general election that the Tories under William Hague could find \u00a320bn of savings rather than the \u00a35bn promised by the party leadership, Mr Letwin will today stop short of precise promises - at least until the manifesto.</p> <p>But speaking on the BBC this morning, Mr Letwin pledged that a Conservative government would stop civil service recruitment from day one. </p> <p>He insisted that cutting back on \"fat government\" would not necessitate mass sackings. </p> <p>Employees would instead be bought out voluntarily through asset sales, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>Mr Letwin defended his refusal to promise specific cuts, acknowledging: \"When we were in power we made promises we couldn't keep.\" </p> <p>He added: \"We are going to tackle the unfair burden of tax but are going to do it on the basis of actually knowing what we can deliver when we make a specific promise.\"</p> <p>But he pledged that the key public services of health and education would have their budgets \"safeguarded\".</p> <p>In his speech today, Mr Letwin is due to identify five areas of the tax system he regards as unfair: </p> <p><b>Council tax</b><br> He will brand the charge a \"stealth tax\" and argue that huge increases in council tax since 1997 have had a disproportionately harmful effect on pensioners. </p> <p><b>Inheritance tax</b><br> Mr Letwin will argue that soaring house prices mean that a tax which was intended to affect the wealthy is now hitting more and more ordinary people. </p> <p><b>Stamp duty </b><br>He will call it a grossly inequitable system which encourages tax avoidance, discriminates against first time buyers and reduces labour mobility. </p> <p><b>Income tax and national insurance marginal rates</b><br> The argument is that after Labour's reforms, more people are paying income tax, and more at higher rates. Mr Letwin argues that high marginal rates damage the incentive to work. </p> <p><b>Taxation of savings and pensions</b><br> Mr Letwin will argue that chancellor Gordon Brown's reforms on tax exemption for shareholders and means-testing of pension benefits have brought the UK to the brink of a pensions crisis. </p> <p>Mr Letwin will identify another three areas - capital gains tax, the taxation of small businesses and environmental taxes - as overcomplicated. </p> <p>He will say that the party will publish within weeks consultation documents for each of the eight areas, including costed options for reform, and that the results of that consultation exercise will form the basis of specific proposals for reform early next year. </p> <p>In a section of his speech briefed to the press, Mr Letwin will say: \"There have been too many broken promises on tax from too many politicians. When we were in office we made promises on tax we could not keep. And everybody knows what happened when Tony Blair promised that he had no plans to increase taxes at all - and then raised taxes 66 times by stealth. So no more broken promises on tax.\" </p> <p>\"In the first month of a Conservative government I will deliver a budget which implements the James review to slim down Britain's fat and bloated bureaucracy - a budget which sets Britain on a path to a lower-tax economy.\" </p> <p>Corporate troubleshooter David James is undertaking a comprehensive review for the Tories of government spending in a bid to identify potential large-scale savings. </p> <p>In his fringe meeting speech on Wednesday, Mr Letwin will argue that there is a moral case for lowering the burden of tax: \"There is something morally wrong with taking people's money when all that the money is doing is to pay for unnecessary or counterproductive increases in the size of government\". </p> <p>Today a Times/Populus poll put Labour on 35% of the vote, three points up on a month ago, with the Tories on 28%, down two points. The Liberal Democrats were on 25%, down one point, and Ukip were on 5%, up three. </p> <p>Despite the party's difficulties, Mr Howard last night insisted that the Tories \"have everything to play for\" at the forthcoming general election. </p> <p>In a speech to a party agents' dinner, Mr Howard argued that the party is \"in good shape\". He pointed to a 20,000 increase in membership in the last year, and a good performance in June's local elections, with some 300 new councillors and control of 14 additional councils.</p> <p>In the other main speech at the conference today, party co-chairman Liam Fox will seek to turn the heat onto the government.</p> <p>Dr Fox will argue that following failures on public service reform the public no longer believe a word the prime minister says and no matter what Mr Blair promises at the next election, no-one \"will be able to trust him\".</p>",
  "The commercial use of cartoon characters as a means of persuading kids to eat burgers is hardly novel. \"Buy a burger get a free plastic Donald Duck/Lion King key ring\" is one of the oldest and simplest marketing strategies around. <p>But trying to persuade kids to eat the cuddly cartoon character in burger form sounds like a different thing entirely. </p> <p>Nevertheless, children in the Highlands are about to be offered a new lunchtime treat to entice them away from fish fingers and smiley faces: the Bambi burger. Venison burgers - made from the meat of locally culled deer - will be offered to children in the region later this month. </p> <p>On the surface, at least, the logic is irrefutable. Left unchecked, red deer, beautiful as they may be, are an environmental menace in northern Scotland and their numbers need to be kept down by culling. </p> <p>Venison is also one of the leanest and healthiest meats available: 1.6g of fat per 100g compared to 12.9g for topside of beef. It has almost double the iron content of beef while having around one third less cholesterol. </p> <p>To add even more merit, meat does not get any more free range than venison and it is a locally sourced produce. In short, it is exactly the sort of meat that nutritionists and environmental campaigners say should be more prevalent in our diet. </p> <p>\"The council wants us to use local produce in school meals as much as possible,\" Bruce Robertson, director of education at Highland council, told Scotland on Sunday. </p> <p>\"There is a plentiful supply of high-quality protein out there in the form of venison. It's straight off the hill, nutritious and organic.\" It is also, however, forever associated with Bambi. </p> <p>In recognition of this, venison burgers and casseroles will be tried out initially in the region's 29 secondary schools. If it is successful, primary school children will be given the opportunity to sample the burgers later in the year. </p> <p>The meat is being supplied by a dealer who trades with Scottish estates who kill deer for sporting or environmental purposes. </p> <p>Despite the obvious image problem, introduction of venison to Scottish school menus is being lauded by chefs, politicians and even animal welfare groups. </p> <p>Fergus Ewing, a Highland MSP, said: \"Venison burgers are the alternative to the Big Mac, and I would rather Scottish kids eat the food of the McDonalds than the food from McDonald's.\" </p> <p>There are around 350,000 wild deer in Scotland and 70,000 of them have to be culled each year. Their number has been growing steadily over the last century, due to mild winters and the lack of any natural predator. </p> <p>Although deer are perhaps the most majestic wild animal left in Britain, their sheer number results in overgrazing, and many environmentalists believe far more should be culled. </p> <p>At least one progressive estate owner, Paul van Vlissigen, who owns Letterewe in Wester Ross, has called for reintroduction of wolves to keep deer numbers in check.</p>",
  "The Conservative party's strident new logo, designed by Saatchi, will get its first airing at Bournemouth. At first glance it seems very odd indeed. With more than a touch of old-school Soviet kitsch about it, and with a high-kick of Springtime for Hitler camp added for good measure. <p>The previous logo, designed in the 1980s, had a simple hand holding the torch. A shirt sleeve and a substantial amount of muscle has been added. </p> <p>Perhaps the idea was to recreate something of the flavour of a wartime David Low cartoon depicting Winston Churchill and members of his cabinet of national unity rolling up their sleeves as they began the fight against Hitler, carrying the torch for liberty, democracy and the rule of law with them. </p> <p>The graphic style of the logo is very 1980; it has much the same look as Wolff Olins' prancing hermaphrodite logo used on new style phone boxes. </p> <p>Its political character dates back much further. Parties of extreme views often used the image of the torch - notably the Nazi party which was famous for its torchlight parades invented by Albert Speer - or trusty swords symbolising truth and justice or, at least, versions of these desirable yet lofty concepts. </p> <p>At the launch, Dr Liam Fox, the party co-chairman, said the changes were intended to signify clarity, strength and unity. There is certainly a sense of that, but whatever it is meant to say, this curious device conjures unfortunate images of political thuggery. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Jonathan Glancey is the Guardian's architecture and design correspondent</p>",
  "<p>The surrealist architecture of Gaudi may have helped Barcelona turn itself into a magnet for tourists and one of Europe's most admired cities. But the emergence of a shop-front in north London in the anarchic style the Catalan pioneered has divided locals and led officials to order its removal. </p> <p>Nearly 5,000 people in Muswell Hill have signed a petition for the Gaudi shop-front to be kept. </p> <p>This may be a battle about architecture and commerce in one north London area, but it also reflects a concern that shopping streets across Britain are increasingly looking the same. It is also a test of how adventurous English taste has become. While Antonio Gaudi's buildings, such as the Sagrada Familia church and his other multi-coloured offerings, perk up Barcelona's streets, some say they are too radical for Britain. </p> <p>The controversy started in July when Chris Ostwald took over the store, intending to open a gallery and arts supply shop. </p> <p>He is a former movie special effects expert who worked on Flash Gordon, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and suitably enough, the Little Shop of Horrors. </p> <p>On to a lattice work of steel he placed sand cement to make a copy of Gaudi's Casa Batllo in Barcelona. </p> <p>While constructing his homage to Catalonia's most famous architect, Mr Ostwald claims a council building inspector told him the building was fine and he could continue. The council deny this. </p> <p>He admits not getting planning permission but vows he will not observe an order to remove the shop-front: \"It's different to the pseudo Edwardian-ness of almost every shop in this area. It stands out for its originality. The council want everything standard and uniform.\" </p> <p>The shop has undulating sandy curves, with columns like soft twisted dough. Compared with neighbouring buildings it is out of character, but Mr Ostwald says it is a lot more tasteful than the garish red sign of a burger bar opposite his shop. </p> <p>The shop-front has caught the attention of locals. </p> <p>One woman who came to a halt outside the shop said: \"I don't think it fits in,\" only for a man behind her to contradict her saying: \"Everything else is drab. The guy's being inventive. Why should it fit into these boring shop-fronts?\" </p> <p>In front of the shop there is a book in which people can give their views: \"This is not Barcelona and Gaudi did not design this building ... I hope Muswell Hill does not become an architectural theme park,\" wrote one. </p> <p>A middle-aged woman stopped to say: \"It's an eyesore,\" only to be told by Julia Gatti: \"It's fantastic.\" </p> <p>Mrs Gatti, resident in the area for 30 years, said: \"The shop before looked awful. </p> <p>\"This is unusual, we need something a bit more unusual.\" </p> <p>Lynne Featherstone, a Liberal Democrat councillor, insisted the law was the law: \"There is no question the owner should have asked for planning permission ... This is a conservation area, and there is no way the shop-front ... is part of the norm.\" </p> <p>But she conceded: \"There are undoubtedly a lot of mediocre shop-fronts in Muswell Hill and one may question what one is conserving.\" </p> <p>Mr Ostwald is trying to play on that anxiety about increasing homogeneity of high streets, with a sign in his window reading: \"If you want this replaced by a McDonald's, don't sign our petition.\" </p> <p>Kate Fox, co-director of the social issues research centre and author of a book on Englishness, said the row was part of a cultural climate of pervasive anxiety: \"There is a trend towards risk aversion.\" </p> <p>Haringey council is adamant that Mr Ostwald must either seek retrospective planning permission, or tear down the Gaudi shop-front: \"The council has served an enforcement notice on the owner which requires him to reinstate the shop-front and to abide by the planning permission granted in 1999. The notice will come into effect on November 15.\" </p> <p>Failure to comply will result in court proceedings with a maximum fine of \u00a320,000.\"</p>",
  "<p>Roberto Benigni, who won an Oscar with a comedy set in a concentration camp, is turning his attention on Iraq. </p> <p> The Italian actor-director of Life is Beautiful has started shooting his new film, The Tiger and the Snow, and set it against the backdrop of the current Iraq conflict.</p> <p> \"I wasn't being cynical in setting the film in Iraq,\" Benigni told Italian newspapers. \"The war has become part of our dreams.\" Benigni's film, about a poet trapped in Iraq, also stars his real-life wife Nicoletta Braschi, as did the earlier film. </p> <p> \"It's certainly not a documentary,\" said Benigni. \"But everything, right from the beginning of the conflict is extremely well documented.\"</p> <p> He added that the poet in the film ends up in a situation that \"overwhelms him.

  "<p>Scottish students today accused ministers of trying to \"sneak in\" legislation for top-up fees to a new bill which will merge the higher and further education funding councils in Scotland.</p> <p>The National Union of Students Scotland said the bill, which was published last week, included legislation inserted at the last minute which would pave the way for the introduction of variable fees.</p> <p>Scottish students currently pay a \u00a32,000 endowment after their graduation - more of a limited graduate tax than a tuition fee. But the Scottish executive has included a clause which would allow ministers to determine the fees charged by universities, and force universities to collect them. </p> <p>The move is a direct contradiction to the executive's commitment not to introduce top-up fees, but ministers insist it will only be used to levy higher fees against English medical students. </p> <p>This is in response to ongoing concerns that Scottish universities are footing the costly bill of training English medics who inevitably return to England after graduation, while Scotland faces a shortage of doctors. </p> <p>A Scottish executive spokesman said: \"Scottish domiciled students will not have to pay any fee to study medicine or any other subject. The fee would only apply to students from other parts of the UK. </p> <p>\"This is not a top-up fee. This is not about universities topping up their income through charging extra fees. This is about ministers and parliament having the power to protect places for Scottish students and protect the NHS in Scotland.\" </p> <p>He added: \"NUS Scotland [is] concerned about the possibility of students from England having to pay this fee to study medicine in Scotland. We are concerned about protecting the NHS in Scotland. We want to make sure that there are a sufficient number of qualified people to work in our health service in the future.</p> <p>But the NUS says that the clause in the bill could later be used to address other problem areas such as veterinary courses and would be the \"thin end of the wedge\".</p> <p>Melanie Ward, the president of NUS Scotland, said: \"Students in Scotland have waited a long time for this merger, and are appalled that this has been used as an opportunity to sneak in top-up fees. </p> <p>\"We have received repeated assurances from the Scottish executive that top-up fees were not an option in Scotland, but this legislation opens the door to their creeping introduction without further primary legislation.</p> <p>She added: \"If you start with medical students, next it will be vets, and then lawyers. It will end up extended to Scottish students. If it's only for medical students why does it not say that in the bill? It's a complete surprise, we're very disappointed.\"</p> <p>The bill was otherwise welcomed by university and college heads, particularly after it followed the announcement of a \u00a31.62bn three-year funding settlement for universities. </p> <p>The convener of Universities Scotland, which represents vice-chancellors, Professor John Archer, said: \"There can be no doubt that this is a significant investment in higher education by the Scottish executive and we can assure everyone that it will make a real difference. </p> <p>\"Today's announcement is a vote of confidence in our universities and we are grateful for it. This is a good day for anyone who values learning, discovery and creativity.\"</p> <p>The bill's first draft caused an uproar after it indicated that the merger of the two funding councils would be a de facto merger of the two sectors. University chiefs lobbied against this and it has now been clarified that the higher and further education sectors, though funded together, will remain distinct. </p> <p>The director of Universities Scotland, David Caldwell, said: \"This process has been a good example of consultative government working well. Constructive dialogue with the Scottish executive has resulted in an improved bill which we are largely pleased with. </p> <p>\"Universities do a good job, colleges do a good job and the body which funds them must be focused on helping them to do those jobs. We are hopeful that legislation will create a body which does just that. We are grateful to the Scottish executive for its receptiveness.\"</p> <p>Tom Kelly, the chief executive of the Association of Scottish Colleges, added: \"We are pleased that this has been a genuine consultation resulting in a better bill. It was important that the powers and even the name of the new funding body should support the work of colleges and universities. This seems to have been achieved.\"</p>",
  "Robert Kilroy-Silk placed himself at the head of the militant grassroots wing of the UK Independence party this weekend by backing calls to reject any general election pact with Michael Howard, in favour of a strategy for \"killing off\" the Tories and taking their place. <p>Though the former daytime TV star had ruled out a direct challenge for the Ukip leadership when it swept to a spectacular tally of 11 MEPs, one himself, in the European elections, he is openly impatient to get control once the present leader, Roger Knapman MEP, steps down. </p> <p>Two days after pushing the Tories into fourth place at Hartlepool, Mr Kilroy-Silk showed his vote-winning potential at Ukip's \"celebratory\" annual conference in Bristol when, to 1,100 cheering party supporters, he made an angry but polished attack on the \"lies of the metropolitan political elite\" on Europe and much else. </p> <p>The conference, in a fading hall, was a throwback to an innocent era, free of security, lobbyists and expensive stalls. The faithful representing Ukip's 26,000 members were predominantly former Tories, mainly middle class, non-metropolitian, and overwhelmingly white. A lot wore ties. </p> <p>But there were a smattering of black faces and of peers - as well as the fallen cabinet minister, Jonathan Aitken, who is considering standing for Ukip in his old seat in Kent. </p> <p>Except when those on the platform (festooned with huge gold sterling signs) were suspected of manipulating the agenda, the mood was genial. Delegates revelled in reminders that senior Conservatives dismissed them as gadflies, extremists and cranks. </p> <p>\"Good morning, gadflies,\" said Nigel Farage from the podium. Mr Farage, an MEP since 1999, is one of those resisting a rush to anoint the party's new star until he has shown more willingness to do the spadework to restructure Ukip. The tension is palpable. </p> <p>Mr Kilroy-Silk clearly believes he cannot be simply the election front man - what his allies call Ukip's \"tart who goes out and gets the vote\" - unless he has more control. </p> <p>He makes no secret of his hostility to the US pollster, Dick Morris (\"if he's good enough for Putin and Clinton, he's good enough for us,\" says Mr Knapman) who told the conference that \"the centrality of sovereignty\" is the hub of the wheel - linking loss of control to the EU with pressing domestic issues. </p> <p>Mr Kilroy-Silk is a former Labour MP, Mr Knapman is a former Tory MP. In a wittily dry speech, albeit no match for his heir-very-apparent, Mr Knapman won laughs for saying his public recognition rate in two years as leader had risen from 0.008% to 0.009%. But, he added, amid cheers, the number of voters who knew what Ukip was had shot up from 20% to 75% over the same period. He did not credit RKS. </p> <p>But there was no disguising the conference's simmering anger at its sense of betrayal (betrayal on everything, from EU fishing policy to asylum and excesses of the Human Rights Act), and its exclusion by the three main parties, \"indistinguishable from each other\" in their lies and evasions. </p> <p>In a speech shown on Sky News inter-active, the 62-year-old Mr Kilroy-Silk pumped up that anger. Handsome, highly-articulate and beautifully dressed, he deployed the made-for-TV skills he has honed for 18 years. His rhetoric, scarcely more populist than at rival conferences but better delivered, fell safely short of demagogy. A former lecturer in political science, he does not need reminding who Oswald Mosley was. </p> <p>Conscious Ukip is accused of being a one-issue party, the East Midlands MEP (looking for a local Westminster seat), broadened his attack to dirty hospitals, child poverty, malnourished pensioners, shops boarded up because of ram-raiding, and people afraid to go out at night for fear of \"drunk-fuelled yobs beating them up\". </p> <p>\"We have got to change this. This is unnecessary ... we are the fourth largest economy in the world.\" But the passage that will most alarm senior Tories as their conference opens in Bournemouth today, saw him pre-empt Ukip's debate on deals with anti-EU MPs in other parties - even before the debate had begun. </p> <p>The Ukip leadership of Mr Knapman, a government whip under John Major, has been seeking to soften its intolerant one-issue image among wavering voters from all the main parties by not running against MPs deemed as anti-Europeans. They include Labour's Austin Mitchell, and the Tories' Richard Shepherd and Angela Browning. Mr Kilroy-Silk, backed by grassroots speakers later on Saturday, would have none of it. </p> <p>\"You have just established yourselves as being new, fresh, honest, open and decent. Why do you want to start wheeler-dealing like they do, that is what they [voters] despise ... the Conservative party is dying, why would you want to give it the kiss of life? What we want to do is kill and replace it. That is our destiny.\" </p> <p>The moderates stress deals would only be done with MPs, not parties. On a show of hands, they were swept aside by a rank and file who believe Ukip is poised for the kind of breakthrough Charles Kennedy believes is coming the Lib Dems' way (Ukip having pushed the Lib Dems into fourth at the European poll). In effect the debate saw the realists defeated by the fundamentalists, or, to put the battle into Green party lingo, realos vs fundies. </p> <p>Yet the conference listened in attentive silence as Alan Eastwood, a former head of the Police Federation, de fended legalisation of drugs as the best means to regulate and decriminalise the epidemic. </p> <p>There were frequent warnings against \"factionalism and the temptations of disunity\". Mr Knapman told delegates it was their message, and \"not any messianic leadership\", which got results. </p> <p>For his part, Mr Kilroy-Silk told them they must be \"ruth less and determined\" if they were to harness the \"mood for change\" and restore to the UK its sovereignty from Brussels. </p> <p>He mocked Mr Howard for stealing his ideas. \"Fine, Michael, you can have my old suits, because I've got lots of them. I used to be Kilroy, you know.\"</p>",
  "The lawyer John Watkinson, who has died of cancer aged 63, was known less as a low-profile Labour MP for rural Gloucestershire West (1974-79) than as a Labour politician who defected to the Social Democratic party, from 1981. <p>Watkinson was born in Bristol and educated at Bristol grammar school and Worcester College, Oxford, where he read PPE. He used a seven-year stint teaching at Rugby school, where he was a champion at amateur Rugby fives, to study for the bar, to which he was called in 1971, practising on the Midland circuit.</p> <p>By then he had already been blooded in his first unsuccessful parliamentary contest at the hopelessly Conservative seat of Warwick and Leamington in 1970, losing to Dudley Smith by 15,639 votes. However, he made the grade in Gloucestershire West in the October 1974 general election by the thin majority of 409 votes, beating the Conservative candidate, Paul Marland, later to marry Caroline Marland, a former managing director of Guardian Newspapers Ltd.</p> <p>Although a good constituency MP, Watkinson made the mistake of taking minor parliamentary jobs. He was parliamentary private secretary at the home office, first to Roy Jenkins and then Merlyn Rees. He was also rapporteur on human rights in the council of Europe and the Western European Union. These posts provided few headlines in constituency newspapers. The Thatcher tide in the 1979 general election replaced him by Marland, and Watkinson went to work for BBC TV as a financial reporter.</p> <p>He reappeared in the political world in 1981 when more than 40 Labour MPs and ex-MPs publicly defected to the SDP under the leadership of the Gang of Four. Like most of the others, Watkinson was pro-European and critical of the leftwing postures and union domination of Michael Foot's Labour party, and, although he twice carried the flag for the SDP in Gloucestershire West, in 1983 and 1987, he did not seriously threaten Marland's hold. </p> <p>He returned to the law, becoming a solicitor in 1986, and also a director of a Chepstow firm, Interconnect Communications. From 1992 he became a specialist adviser on telecommunications to a score of newly emerging countries, largely on the basis of his 1987 book, UK Telecommunications Manual.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife Jane, two sons and two daughters.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Taylor Watkinson, lawyer, politician and telecommunications specialist, born January 25 1941; died September 21 2004</p>",
  "<b> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday October 6 2004</b> <br> Alexandra Shulman, the editor of Vogue, has asked us to make it clear that far from the negative view readers might have inferred from her comments in the article below, she still considers the Versace brand to be one of the most famous in the world. In fact, her views were not published in their entirety. Alexandra Shulman emphasises that she is, and always has been, a staunch supporter of Donatella Versace.      For the audience at Versace's crucial Milan catwalk show on Saturday night, it would have looked like business as usual. The label, which has become synonymous with brashness, put on a characteristically confident - bordering on self-indulgent - performance, with cleavage-plunging designs inspired by \"a goddess emerging from the sea ... [with] a new and joyful attitude\". <p>But behind the scenes, the mood inside one of the world's most high-profile fashion houses is far from joyful. Sales have been falling remorselessly while highly publicised internal struggles and family problems have combined to throw the brand into crisis. </p> <p>The trouble had been brewing long before the first model stepped on to the catwalk in Milan. Donatella Versace, the label's head designer, had left hospital just a month earlier after treatment for what is officially described as a \"personal family matter\". </p> <p>To add to the sense of turmoil, the label announced that, in a departure with tradition, it would not be showing the slightly cheaper Versus line alongside the main collection - a clear signal to the fashion industry, which thrives on an image of modernity, confidence and success - that all was not well. While the company explained this was to \"put all focus on the Versace collection\", it led to speculation among commentators that the smaller lines were not up to fashion show standard this season. </p> <p>\"In terms of fashion credibility, the label has certainly slipped,\" Alexandra Shulman, the editor of Vogue, said. \"Donatella is probably not as skilled a fashion designer as her brother was. She never was a designer and you can't just become a designer over night.\" </p> <p>But Donatella Versace was forced to do just that in 1997 when her brother, Gianni, was murdered in Miami and she took over as the label's creative director. </p> <p>Although Saturday night was the first Versace collection since Donatella left hospital, a spokesman insisted that this had not affected her involvement in the collection. \"No one does any work in Italy in August anyway, so it made no difference,\" he added. </p> <p>It was also the first collection since Allegra Beck, Donatella's 18-year-old daughter, became Versace's largest shareholder when she came into the inheritance left by her uncle of a 50% stake in the company. Allegra, who is studying drama in the US, has let it be known that she has more interest in becoming an actress than a fashion designer. </p> <p>The show demonstrated that the label continues to have an unknockable confidence in doing what it wants, regardless of what sceptics say, or what trends other designers attempt to mine. It also showed on Saturday how it is trying to move ahead while staying true to its own styles. </p> <p><b> Reinvention </b><br> </p> <p> The first half of the show was far better than Versace has done for a while: pastel coloured knee-length jersey dresses, seahorse prints and giant shell buckles on gold belts all of which were very Versace yet wearable. </p> <p>But this was little more than a defiant limp onwards and is unlikely to convince the fashion industry that the label has managed to reinvent its image to meet the tastes of a changing market. </p> <p>\"The appeal of Versace has always been 90% down to its image, and its image has been damaged since Gianni's death,\" said one magazine fashion editor who asked to remain anonymous. \"And if you're try ing to convince a woman to spend \u00a31,000 on a frock, your image has to be secure.\" </p> <p>Versace was propelled to public prominence on the strength of a safety pin dress, and has remained on a similarly precarious base ever since. It became closely associated with celebrities such as Elton John and Princess Diana, thanks to Gianni Versace's skill at designing attention-grabbing clothes and the suggestion of a similar accompanying lifestyle. </p> <p>Since his death, the company has found itself in the uncomfortable position of treading a tightrope between making necessary cost-saving measures and maintaining its image. </p> <p>In July 2003, it cancelled its haute couture show in Paris in favour of a smaller presentation, and last July it did not bother with a presentation. Haute couture shows are costly, but seen as vital in maintaining a brand's aspirational image, which then translates into lucrative perfume and accessories sales. </p> <p>In 1999, the family sold Gianni's collection of 25 Picasso paintings and a Cezanne. Yet all of these efforts to retrench seem to have helped little. </p> <p><b> Losses</b><br> </p> <p> Versace is making $300m less per year than it did when Gianni was alive, with a year on year decline of 17.2%. The company's net debt at the end of 2003 was $142m. Last summer, Banca Intesa extended a 120m euro private loan so it could pay off a 100m euro bond on time. The family was also landed with a \u00a325m inheritance tax bill. </p> <p>Ms Shulman said Donatella was not entirely at fault for the crisis. \"The important thing is whether she has a vision for the house. It's the accessories and perfume and mood of the brand that really count,\" she said. \"Gianni was one of the first people to realise that, and he spent a lot of money on creating this Versace aura.\" </p> <p>There are plenty of other Italian labels with a similar kind of molto sexy style, such as Dolce and Gabbana and Roberto Cavalli, which are not saddled with such an image problem and who have modernised without compromising their style. Gucci, in particular, proved a significant competitor during the period when Tom Ford was creative director, as the American designer managed to make that once languishing brand cool again and gave it credibility in the eyes of the lucrative American market. Ford left Gucci earlier this year, yet instead of capitalising on this, Versace has mired itself down in further tribulations. </p> <p>Many fashion insiders are unsure whether the label can regain its former might, but others point out that all brands \"ebb and flow\" and Versace's moment will return. \"The real question is whether Donatella can evolve the brand,\" said Ms Shulman. \"It's tough to say as she has been in hospital and before that she presumably wasn't operating on top form. I like to think she can - with the right people around her.\" </p> <p><b>House style: Rise of a label</b></p> <p><b>1972</b> Gianni Versace starts work in Milan fashion houses.<br> <b> 1978</b> The Versace label is founded and the first Gianni Versace collection for women is shown as his boutique opens in Milan. <br> <b> Autumn/winter 1991-92</b> Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington burst on to the catwalk, lip-synching to George Michael's hit Freedom. <br> <b> May 18 1994</b> Liz Hurley arrives at the premiere of Four Weddings and a Funeral with boyfriend Hugh Grant in a \u00a32,500 black Versace dress held together by a seam of safety pins.<br> <b> July 15 1997</b> Gianni Versace, 50, is shot on his Miami doorstep.

  "<p>I attended last night's London-only event on <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/showing/nft/resfest2004/calendar/details.php?title=Film-making%20and%20Gaming%2C%20Gaming%20and%20Film-making\">videogames and film</a> at the travelling <a href=\"http://www.resfest.com\">resfest</a>'s NFT location, hoping for something that was outside of the regular remit for discussions of this sort. And, to be honest, I was disappointed with the result.</p> <p>The programme was half-\"owned\" by Sony (quite literally - they set it up) to promote the release of their forthcoming driving-adventure title <a href=\"http://www.tiscali.co.uk/games/previews/2004/08/06/thegetaway2blackmonday.html\">The Getaway 2: Black Monday</a>, and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima\">machinima</a> that was on display was only marginally interesting.</p> <p>Even the presence of the <a href=\"http://www.redvsblue.com\">Red vs Blue</a> boys, all the over from their <a href=\"http://www.roosterteeth.com/home.php\">Rooster Teeth</a> studio in Austin, TX, was lacklustre and ill-prepared. However, it did generate quite a few questions in my mind, both about the nature of narrative in games and narrative in film, and stimulated some good discussion on the way home...</p> <p>The first half of the presentation was dominated by the admittedly-adept skills of a pair of the production team of The Getaway, fastidiously explaining the process of developing a computer game. There were a few comparisons with film-making - only one of the two had any experience with that medium - and the predominant sense was that \"making games is harder than making movies. We're great.\" While this might have sparked dialogue with a mixed audience of games and film creators, the make-up of the crowd was the usual suspects of London games-land and therefore seemed only to remind the gathered that The Getaway's in-house Sony team had big bucks for production, and that others were forced to create competitive products on the producers' less moneyed handouts.</p> <p>The focus was on cut-scene and design narrative, with little to no detail on the game mechanics that may make interactive products more \"cinematic\", or even what that means. That was a little detail I hoped would have had an attempted answer, and would have set out this event from others that have come before. It also raised the question (in my mind at least) of whether narrative is important for a game experience, or if trying to crowbar it into a medium who's animation cannot compete with contemporary Hollywood visuals (and is therefore distracting) is wasteful and misguided. I don't disregard writer and Narrative Producer Katie Ellwood's contribution to The Getaway and to Getaway 2: Black Monday - and the 9000 lines of script that are included in the game - but if my past actions are anything to go by, I'll probably skip through them in favour of more gaming. Indeed, one of the comments from an audience member as I left the auditorium was \"Why are games trying so hard to be like Hollywood? They don't need cut scenes to push the story forward. Look at Half Life.\" Indeed. There are no animated movies between action sequences there; information is passed on either through direct conversation with other characters or in overheard dialogue.</p> <p>The second part of the evening kicked off with a DVD of machinima offerings that seemed limited in their - wait for it - narrative, and highlighted the difference between creating a product that was designed to be played versus designed to be watched.</p> <p>Perhaps because machinima creators are restricted by the things that one can do in the games or the bugs which they find, they felt like they were made by a bunch of guys who thought \"we've got the best multiplayer death matches EVER!\" and decided it would be cool to record them, perhaps with a few unoriginal lines of dialogue to pad them out and set the \"scene\" (ext. daylight. three guys open a treasure chest. fight over who gets the booty). Just like the truly disappointing <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/fightbox/\">attempts</a> to put this kind of thing on terrestrial TV, watching other people \"do\" multiplayer combat is just not interesting.</p> <p>In contrast, the special Red vs Blue episode created for the event, \"London Calling\", was superb and featured the three main characters shooting the proverbial, with well-timed witty dialogue. That was what was entertaining, and the viewer actually was able to forget that they were watching in-game animations. Their efforts could easily turn into the next South Park.</p> <p>In light of this, and the <a href=\"http://http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/games/archives/game_culture/2004/10/cinema_games_halo_and_the_sims_2_unite.html#more\">recent announcement</a> that Rooster Teeth are working on a sit-com style series set in EA's The Sims 2, another question is raised. It reflects the <a href=\"http://terranova.blogs.com/\">debate</a> that currently exists over the rights of players of massively multiplayer online games to sell game items for personal pocket money on auction sites like eBay: while Rooster Teeth currently have the blessing of the makers of both Halo and The Sims 2, what happens when this thing starts to grow so big that it creeps into mainstream consciousness? Who'll then own the likenesses, the dialogue and the creative content that's generated by production companies within publishers' products? The boys said EA currently have no editorial control over the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.strangerhood.com\">Strangerhood</a> series, but what happens if the machinima treatment becomes more \"inappropriate\" for EA's worldwide brand?</p> <p>There were quite a few questions left unanswered in both segments of last night's showcase, and it would have fared better primarily if the first part had been more broadly defined. I'd quite like to see a panel discussion with filmmakers who've had the opportunity to make a game and vice versa to highlight the uniqueness of both media, and areas where they may \u2013 or may not \u2013 learn from each other. That would have been worthwhile, and the audience might have been wider.</p> <p>Otherwise, the resfest rocked.</p>",
  "Sudan is sometimes described as \"Egypt's little brother\". The phrase is meant to give a sense of the kinship between the two nations, but \"little brother\" also seems an apt personification of the country: if Sudan were a single human being, it might well be someone's troubled younger sibling - an overgrown teenage boy with floppy, uncontrollable limbs and a violent identity crisis. <p>Sudan is Africa's biggest country. It stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the border of Egypt in the north down to lush, tropical jungles in the south, encompassing hundreds of tribes who speak more than 100 languages.</p> <p>The north is Muslim, speaks Arabic and shares a culture with north African countries such as its neighbour Egypt - though many of Sudan's Muslims are black, rather than Arab, and speak an African language as their mother tongue. </p> <p>The north, which includes Darfur, is a band of semi-desert that blooms in the wet season and then returns to sand and scrub in the dry season; southern Sudan, meanwhile, is a fertile landscape of marshes and jungle and is home to nomadic Christians or nature worshippers, tribes of tall, athletic people with aubergine-black skin and ritual scars on their faces.</p> <p>Trying to forge a single collective identity out of this sprawling country is a difficult task, and no Sudanese government has yet achieved it. Instead, in a succession of regimes since independence, the members of a handful of northern, Arab tribes have sought to concentrate wealth and power in their own hands.</p> <p>As a result, during almost five decades since Sudan became independent of the British, it has known only nine years of fragile peace, between 1972 and 1983. For the rest of that time, the country's anguished search for its own identity has taken the form of a civil war - not the recent conflict in Darfur but a long, grinding struggle between the largely Arab north and the black African south. </p> <p>The southern rebellion began in 1955, the year before independence, when it became clear that southerners were being excluded from the formation of the first post-colonial government. In 1983, the war reignited, partly as a backlash against the Sudanese government's decision to impose Islamic sharia law throughout the country.</p> <p>A fierce strain of Islamism took firm hold in the north in 1989, when Omar Hassan el-Bashir, the general who is now the president, overthrew the elected government in a coup. The armed forces and civil service were purged, prayers were made compulsory in schools and sharia law was rigorously enforced. Thieves had limbs amputated and the illicit brewing of alcohol was punished with flogging.</p> <p>For a time, the government prosecuted the civil war with renewed vigour. The discovery of oil in southern Sudan in the late 1990s helped keep the fighting going, allowing the government to boost its manufacturing of ammunition and buy helicopters and fighter aircraft from friendly countries such as China. But under pressure from the US, the government and the rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army were pushed into negotiations.</p> <p>In May this year, the long war in the south appeared at last to be over when the government and rebels signed peace accords at the Kenyan resort town of Naivasha - but then the war in Darfur erupted. </p> <p>The rebels of Darfur believed that if they, like the southerners, took up arms, they too might be granted concessions by the central government. Khartoum, however, thought differently. With international attention distracted by the peace talks with the southern rebels, the Sudanese government sought to crush the uprising in Darfur with brute strength.</p> <p>Janjaweed irregulars backed by helicopter gunships and bombers razed villages of the tribes whose members were leading the revolt. Over 1 million people have fled their homes and now live huddled in giant camps across Darfur. The havoc has served only to fuel the rebellion, with boys and men from Darfur's shattered villages joining up with the rebels to seek revenge. </p> <p>In the south, the final stage of peace negotiations has been delayed by the conflict in Darfur but is due to begin on Thursday October 7. There is some hope that a peace deal in the south could serve as a blueprint for peace throughout Sudan. </p> <p>But peace will only come if there is a genuine sharing of power within the country and a chance of reconciling Arab with African and Christian with Muslim to forge a new state that reflects Sudan's racial and religious variety.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>TORIES HAVE 'NEVER BEEN IN SUCH DESPAIR'</b></p> <p>The phone calls a convalescing Tony Blair is reported to have made to newspaper editors over the weekend appear to have done the trick. The Blair-Brown rift is off the front pages - with the exception of the FT, which runs a tactful \"Brown leads call for unity\" splash.</p> <p>Mr Blair may have been ailing, but the Tories - if the papers are to be believed - are on their deathbeds. \"The Conservative party is dying. Why would you want to give it the kiss of life?\" Robert Kilroy-Silk, who has now made his ambition to lead Ukip public, said at the Ukip conference over the weekend. \"What we have to do is to kill it and replace it.\" And the papers, it would seem, agree.</p> <p>\"Despite all the bad times the Conservative party has had in the last decade or so, it has never been in such despair as it is today,\" writes Simon Heffer in the Mail. \"Its challenge this week is not to convince anyone that it can win the next election - for that is a pipe dream - but to convince the millions fed up with Tony Blair and Labour that the Tory party can, at last, be an effective opposition.\"</p> <p>The Telegraph is more optimistic, begging the party to bite the bullet and pledge to cut taxes - something the Guardian predicts Michael Howard will do this week, although not as emphatically as the Telegraph would wish. The line, the Tories' co-chairman Liam Fox tells the Guardian, will be similar to Margaret Thatcher's in 1979 - no specific promises, but a \"very clear direction that the government intended to reduce taxes\".</p> <p>The Times' revelation that Michael Howard is even less popular than Iain Duncan Smith was will come as a blow to the party, as will a Populus poll putting Labour on 35% of the vote and the Conservatives seven points behind. There is further embarrassment in the Mirror: \"Nightclub boss Peter Stringfellow delighted a crowd of 200 young Tories when he shouted 'Die, Tony, die!' hours after the prime minister's heart operation,\" splashes the paper.</p> <p>\"Nihil desperandum\", consoles the Telegraph, which says it would be a \"profound error\" for Mr Howard to try to win back Ukip supporters by stealing the party's policies: \"Elections are won on the middle ground, not the extremes\".

Condoleezza Rice agreed in 2002 they were \"only really suitable for nuclear weapons programmes ...

  "The Royal Academy of Music's sweeping facade bears down on the Marylebone Road in London with a not unjustified air of superiority.

In a new recital room the harpist of the Paris Op\u00e9ra energetically strums Bach to herself. </p> <p>But his famous institution is facing allegations of class bias after official figures revealed it managed to admit just over half of entrants from the state sector, against a government-set benchmark of almost 88%. </p> <p>Another leading conservatoire, the Royal College of Music, managed only 45%, leading to criticism that the two institutions had a toff count of Oxbridge proportions. </p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum three art schools - Wimbledon School of Art, Norwich School of Art and Design and Kent Institute of Art and Design - had between 98.7% and 100% of entrants from state schools, according to the figures. </p> <p>Crude statistics, of course, are misleading. There is one simple explanation for the high state-school count at those art colleges: first-year undergraduates have almost invariably come from a foundation-year art course - in other words, from the state sector. </p> <p>So if the entire first-year intake of Wimbledon School of Art had been to Eton or Roedean, the fact would be invisible on this set of statistics. </p> <p>Unfairly, one might argue, since failure to meet the benchmark figures has financial implications. </p> <p>In the case of the Royal Academy of Music, \"funding was taken from us,\" according to its principal, Professor Curtis Price, \"and put into [the government's] Widening Participation Fund.\" </p> <p>However, the conservatoires' student mix has reignited debate over access to music education for state pupils. </p> <p>Prof Price, and his deputy, Professor Jonathan Freeman-Attwood, are clear on what they regard as the root of the problem - the running-down of free instrument teaching in state schools in the late 1980s and through the 1990s. </p> <p>Things are improving now, but, says Prof Price, \"a generation has been missed. Students in state schools have not been given the opportunity to have teaching to the standard required to be a professional musician. And the conservatories - the Royal College of Music, the Royal Academy of Music, and the Royal Northern College of Music - are here to train professional performers.\" </p> <p>They stress the fact that to fulfill Academy standards, \"you can't start giving someone music lessons at 15 or 16. Musical talent emerges early and unless it is nurtured, it is wasted.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, they make \"strenuous efforts\" to recruit from diverse UK backgrounds, running open days, forging links with schools, and organising roadshows. The Academy has a notably international student body, with 47% coming from overseas. </p> <p>At Wimbledon College of Art the principal, Professor Roderick Bugg, does not have a figure at his fingertips to describe the educational background of his students before their foundation year. </p> <p>His guess is that Wimbledon would have a higher proportion of state-educated students than the Royal Academy of Music, acknowledging \"there is a lot of interest in visual culture in schools, and a lot of interest particularly in new technology and new media\". </p> <p>Nonetheless, he identifies problems shared by his colleagues on the Marylebone Road. While educational priorities in schools are currently focusing on getting artists into schools to work with children, and some exciting projects are springing up, he observes a gradual downgrading in children's knowledge of the basic grammar of art. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Prof Price defends his position: \"The problem is not with higher education but with secondary education. Send me the students, please!\"</p>",

  "If the Conservatives have a future, a question some now are now asking seriously, it surely lies in the sturdy, well-heeled and cheerful figure of David Cameron. <p>At 38, Cameron has been promoted to the shadow cabinet and is routinely spoken of as a future leader. He is all too well aware of the dangers of that, showing irritation at the suggestion that he and his friend George Osborne are the Blair and Brown of the Tories. </p> <p>\"Thus ending both our careers prematurely,\" he interrupts. \"It's a silly, crazy notion. Unlike Blair and Brown, we actually get on with each other, we're very good friends; that is as far as I am prepared to take the analogy.\" </p> <p>Even so, the one universally praised aspect of Michael Howard's reshuffle was the pair's arrival on the front bench. Cameron has control of bringing together the manifesto, the Tories' Alan Milburn, perhaps. </p> <p>As he reflected on the party's dreadful performance at Hartlepool (\"very disappointing, but we just have to take it on the chin\"), the vital questions for Cameron are: does he think the Conservatives should swing to the right to see off the UK Independence party; and if not, what alternative theme does he want the Tories to rally around? </p> <p>On the argument for a harder line on immigration and Europe, Cameron is unequivocal. </p> <p>\"That is absolute rubbish. The whole thing about clear blue water is ridiculous. There is enough clear blue water to drown in.\" The Tories had to respond to Ukip by emphasising that the real choice was between Tony Blair and Michael Howard, with the latter's aversion to the euro and the European constitution. \"Voting for a fringe party doesn't make any sense. The more that we can show that we have a credible plan that will make a difference to this country, with an alternative prime minister who is self-evidently experienced and intellectually up to the job, then that is the way to convince people that there is a point to politics.\" </p> <p>He agrees with Howard that firm but fair control of immigration was essential to good race relations, and that people wanted \"order, control and fairness in place of disorder, lack of control, and unfairness\". </p> <p>But Conservatives would offer, he said, \"a credible, decent, tolerant, sensible, moderate opposition, with a really good plan for this country - that is the key\". </p> <p>We will come back to the plan later. But keeping with the temptation to lurch rightwards, what about tax? Michael Howard is promising targeted tax cuts. Cameron is very cautious. The priority, he says, is to give value for money for today's taxes. </p> <p>\"People feel heavily overtaxed; but it's not the time to come out and say here are some specific tax reductions, because they think politicians have just told them lies about tax for 20 years. We told them we would try and cut tax year after year after year, and we had to put tax up - as I know to my cost, I was in the Treasury - and Labour said they had no plans to increase tax at all, and they increased tax 66 times. So people simply don't want to hear more promises. </p> <p>\"We want to show over time that we want to move towards a lower tax economy, but we mustn't make promises that we can't keep.\" There was a path towards lower taxes but \"we will not make specific promises at this stage\". </p> <p>So what about the Tories' positive plan? They have begun to look like a party without a theme. Cameron's answer is not to lurch rightwards, but to offer a moderate, modest package of changes. His big idea is deliberately not to promise much, but to offer a detailed timetable. </p> <p>\"What we're going to do is the opposite of what Labour has just done. They've made a huge mistake, because the big problem in politics at the moment is disillusion, cynicism and apathy. People don't think we're going to achieve anything. They feel so let down by a government that promised the earth - wonderful phrases, and grandiloquent language. </p> <p>\"We're going to do the opposite of that. We're going to be very clear and precise about what we're going to do.\" </p> <p>This means, he says, \"a timetable for action that's going to show what we are going to do in the first day, in the first week, in the first month. If anybody says I will promise you a transport system for the 21st century, they will be taken out and shot. </p> <p>\"It will be: 'These are the road schemes I will start, these are the regulations I will get rid of.' Precise, clear, trying to restore some accountability. And I'm very excited about it.\" </p> <p>To me, it seems well-meaning and thoughtful rather than exciting - particularly since Cameron's suggested slogan is indeed merely \"a timetable for action\". But he seems genuinely worked up: \"If I hear David Blunkett announce weekend prisons one more time, I'll apply to go to one. People have had it. They don't believe that they're going to do anything. </p> <p>\"That's a problem for us, because we've got to convince them that we will do things.\" </p> <p>Rather than banging on about Europe, Cameron promises that the Tories will be very focused on health, education, crime, and the economy. By the end of the conference, he hopes everyone on the doorstep will know about the Conservative plans in these core areas. </p> <p>They include getting rid \"of all Whitehall targets for hospitals, so that hospital managers can concentrate on a clean environment and treating patients; we will allow good schools to expand by getting rid of the surplus places rule, so there will be more choice for parents to pick a good school for their children; the home secretary will immediately get rid of the early-release scheme so that we don't have 3,000 extra crimes a year from people let out of prison early.\" </p> <p>Some of the actions the Tories would announce \"may seem quite small in themselves, but that's credible and believable and understandable. Add them all up and they'll make a difference to people's lives\". </p> <p>If this sounds moderate, that is the way he wants it. On the social agenda, he comes across as liberal, insisting politicians should not \"twitch at the net curtains\" and tell people what to do. \"The Conservative party has got to be for everyone: old, young, black, white, straight, gay, urban, rural. We are a national party, we're a party for everybody; and it's important that we show that in the way we talk and the way we behave. </p> <p>\"I just don't think that the Conservative party is anti-gay, anti-immigrant.\" </p> <p>All this is fine, but does not Cameron accept the obvious, that the Tories have no chance of winning the election? </p> <p>He does not, arguing that with both parties in the 32-34% range, anything can happen. People were angry with Blair, he noted, \"but that begs the question, why are we still stuck on this level of polling?\" </p> <p>People now trusted the Tories more, and did not think they would lurch this way or that. They just were not sure they would make any difference. </p> <p>\"If you ask people, does Blair deserve a third term, they don't just say no - they shout it. So I think it's all open.\" </p> <p>Despite his optimism, many Tories of his generation have simply abandoned politics, unwilling to put up with years in opposition. What makes him different? </p> <p>\"I was always interested in issues rather than politics,\" he says, and lists his day's diary in his Oxfordshire constituency, meeting business people, farmers and campaigners. \"What a wonderful day, what a great way to spend your life.\" </p> <p>But life is not all easy. He has two small children, one seriously disabled, and has probably spent more time in NHS hospitals than anyone else in politics. He raves about the quality of care, though he finds getting both in and out of hospital difficult: \"We've had some awful six and seven hour waits in casualty. And then, when it's time to come out, you can never find anyone to discharge you.\" </p> <p>With his wit and plummy voice, Cameron comes over as a milder version of Boris Johnson: less wild self-parody and playing it for laughs; more evidence of a social conscience. He has, he admits, a \"terribly corny\" CV: Eton and Oxford, \"though I got a first, that's something not everyone does\". Clever, ambitious and moderate as he is, I do not for a moment think he expects his party to win the election. But I do think he is thinking long-term, and is clear in his mind that the Tories can only win in the centre ground; and that therefore he is indeed a man to watch.</p> <p><b>The CV</b></p> <p><b> David Cameron</b></p> <p><b>Born</b> October 9 1966 </p> <p><b> Education </b> Eton; Oxford University </p> <p><b> Family</b> Married, two children </p> <p><b> Career </b> Conservative research department, 1988-92; special adviser HM Treasury, Home Office, 1992-94; head of corporate affairs, Carlton Communications 1994-2001; Member of Parliament for Witney, Oxfordshire, since 2001; deputy chairman, Conservative party, 2003-04; head of policy coordination and member of shadow cabinet, 2004- </p> <p>Put your questions to David Cameron: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/liveonline\">theguardian.com/liveonline</a></p>",
  "<p>It's the sitcom that the BBC dares not show. But Popetown, its controversial animated comedy starring Ruby Wax and Jerry Hall, could still make it to the small screen - on Channel 4.</p> <p>Popetown was dropped by the BBC3 controller, Stuart Murphy, after more than 6,000 Catholics complained before they had even seen it. The 10-part series had been completed at an estimated cost of \u00a32.4m when the decision was made to drop it last month. </p> <p>Now its producer, Channel X, whose credits include BBC2's Shooting Stars, is in talks with other broadcasters about taking the show. They include Channel 4, for whom the company made The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross and produces music show All Back to Mine.</p> <p>Channel X executives have refused to comment further on the show since it was dropped. In a statement, the company's managing director, Alan Marke, said he was \"incredibly disappointed\" since he was proud of the project and the talent involved. </p> <p>But he added: \"I understand the world has changed since the series was originally commissioned and sympathise with the difficult decision the BBC has had to take.\" </p> <p>Any switch to another channel is likely to be complicated, with negotiations over future rights to the show still the subject of negotiations between Channel X and the BBC. The show is also being sold overseas this week by BBC Worldwide at the Mipcom international TV festival in Cannes.</p> <p>Mr Murphy's decision to drop the show came two weeks after the BBC director general, Mark Thompson, a practising Catholic, discussed the programme with the Archbishop of Birmingham, Vincent Nichols, and his press secretary, Peter Jennings.</p> <p>\"Despite all the creative energy that has gone into this project and the best efforts of everyone involved, the comic impact of the delivered programme does not outweigh the potential offence it will cause,\" said Mr Murphy. \"It has been an extremely difficult and complex decision to make.</p> <p>\"There is a fine judgment line in comedy between the scurrilously funny and the offensive... unfortunately once we saw the finished series it became clear that the programme fell on the wrong side of that line.\"</p> <p>Popetown features Wax as the voice of a fictional Pope, who bounces around the Vatican on a pogo stick and is surrounded by a gang of backstabbing cardinals. The series also stars Little Britain's Matt Lucas, MacKenzie Crook from The Office, Big Train's Kevin Eldon and Morwenna Banks, who was one of the voices behind another BBC3 animation Monkey Dust.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Journalists are eagerly awaiting what they hope will be a new era in government openness. On January 1 next year, the long-awaited Freedom of Information Act comes into force, requiring public bodies to throw open their records to the press and public. </p> <p>However, the act contains some significant exemptions to this new right to know, which we can expect to be widely any person to have information held by any public body communicated to him or her. Public bodies include not only government departments and local councils but also many obscure state institutions such as the Poisons Board and the New Deal Task Force. </p> <p>The need for a change in approach was illustrated just last week when the Department of Health refused to disclose the names of countries to which blood - possibly contaminated with the human form of mad cow disease - had been exported. The department was accused of \"deadly secrecy\", but merely responded that it did not feel it appropriate to release this information. When the act comes into force, the department will have to come up with a much better reason that that. </p> <p>The act does contain numerous exemptions where state information will not have to be communicated to the public. These range from the straightforward and sensible, such as material concerning national security or defence, to the more vague and controversial, such as matters likely to jeopardise the economic interests of the country and material relating to the formulation of government policy. Any communications with the Queen and the rest of the royal family would also be exempt. Many battles no doubt lie ahead over the ambit of these exemptions as civil servants try to prevent the disclosure of embarrassing information. </p> <p>Experience from abroad suggests that public bodies rarely embrace with enthusiasm legislatively inspired openness. For example, in Ireland, where freedom of information legislation was introduced in 1997 with a very liberal initial regime, the right of access was quickly circumscribed shortly before its application was to be extended to cover cabinet and other government papers. </p> <p>Even though the act is just months away, the working of some parts of it remain to be determined. One such area relates to the fees that can be levied by a public body for providing information. The act states that when a request for information is made, the public body may respond with a fees notice stating the amount it will charge for compliance.</p> <p>When calculating this charge, the body must comply with regulations determined by the Lord Chancellor. Over the summer, there was controversy over whether the imposition of hefty fees could dissuade wouldbe applicants from using the act. However, last month it was reported that the prime minister had determined that there should be no fees levied at all where the cost of compliance fell below a prescribed limit - suggested to be in the order of \u00a3600. </p> <p>We are still waiting for specific regulations to confirm this. Nonetheless, it now appears that obtaining information will be generally free, which is to be welcomed. However, the act also states that when the estimated cost of compliance exceeds the limit, there is no obligation on the public body to provide the information at all, even - somewhat curiously - if the applicant agrees to reimburse the body in full. Where there are several requests from a single person, or requests from different people apparently acting together within a set period of time, the public body can consider these to be a single request for the purposes of determining whether the cost exceeds the limit.</p> <p> An early draft of the regulations issued by the government concerning fees (which appear to have been superseded by Tony Blair's rethink) suggested that a public body would be given considerable discretion in estimating costs and that these could include the costs of staff time. Where it concerns a fairly complex request for information, a public body may be tempted to tot up the cost and say that it exceeds the limit. This would mean that the information would not have to be provided. It may be that in many cases, an applicant could avoid this exception by making a number requests for smaller amounts of information outside the set period, which would allow the public body to consider them as one request for the purposes of these costs provisions (proposed to be 20 days in the draft regulations). </p> <p>However, such an approach will at the very least significantly slow an inquiry. Moreover, some requests may in practice be indivisible and a discrete item of information may inevitably be highly time-consuming to obtain. Such information is in effect removed from the ambit of the act. It is to be hoped that before the act comes into force, the government will make it clear that public bodies should not seek to make liberal use of the costs exception, particularly where the applicant is prepared to reimburse the cost. </p> <p>Otherwise, in respect of relatively complex matters, the act may prove to be a toothless tiger. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Dan Tench is a media partner at Olswang</p>",
  "Welcome to the Northerner, Guardian Unlimited's weekly digest of the best of the northern press. <p>___________________________________________</p> <p>In Liverpool, the endless wait for news from Iraq continued in a terraced street in inner city Walton as Ken Bigley's ordeal entered its second week. His kidnappers released a new video of the engineer shackled and looking gaunt. In the footage, released on al-Jazeera, Mr Bigley wept as he branded Tony Blair a liar. \"He doesn't care about me,\" he said. \"I am just one, just one person. Please, please help me. I'm begging you. I'm begging you to speak, to push.\"</p> <p>Mrs Bigley's elderly mother, Lil, was hospitalised for a second time as the strain became too much for her. His wife, Sombat, pleaded with Tony Blair to save her husband. \"Please Mr Tony, give me my husband back,\" she said. \"He does not want any part in this war. He is a just, kind and gentle man looking after his family.\"</p> <p>But the prime minister said he was doing absolutely everything to secure Mr Bigley's release.</p> <p>The Walton MP Peter Kilfoyle told the Post: \"I think obviously there are mixed reactions to the footage released - joy Ken Bigley is still alive, but horror at the conditions he is being held under. It is significant that after all this time there may be some way to obtain Ken's release.\"</p> <p>Professor David Canter, a lecturer in investigative psychology at Liverpool University, said the longer the hostage crisis goes on, the more hope there is that Mr Bigley will be released. He said the danger time during kidnapping was during the first 24 hours. \"As time goes on the captives and captor get to know each other and the capitves become more confident in the environment they are holding the person,\" he said. \"I am almost certain there are negotiations around serious money. They have moved into the realm of kidnapping and extortion.\"</p> <p>___________________________________________</p> <p> Racist attacks and bullying in schools are on the increase in the wake of the British National Party's success in the local elections, according to a worrying report by Calderdale council in Yorkshire. The report says that a total of 173 racist incidents have taken place in the last academic year.</p> <p>The Yorkshire Post reports that even a teacher is listed as a perpetrator. According to the figures, the number of white bullies has increased from 118 to 156 while the number of attackers from ethnic minorities has fallen from 32 to 20 in the last year.</p> <p>A local Liberal Democrat councillor, Nader Fekri, said he was concerned about the the influence the BNP had had on the area, citing racist propoganda which had been left outside a junior school in Calderdale a fortnight ago. \"There was no name on it, but it's believed it had been left by a political party,\" he said. \"The teachers and parents didn't want it publicised because they didn't want to inflame the situation. That's understandable, but it means these things aren't brought out into the open.\"</p> <p>In a similar incident in Sheffield last year, the BNP handed out leaflets to schoolchildren about racism against white people. Janet East, the secretary of the Calderdale Unity Against Racism and Fascism, said racist attitudes \"seem to be percolating down\". \"Whether it's because of the BNP or because of beleagured communities fighting for what they've got isn't clear. There's an increased feeling in society that it's OK to be racist about certain groups.\"</p> <p>___________________________________________</p> <p>An administrator at Castle Hill Hospital in Hull has been trained to perform endoscopy procedures in an effort to cut waiting times. The procedures are used to investigate patients suffering from bowel and stomach disease and for the early detection of gastrointestinal cancers.</p> <p>The pilot programme by Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust is understood to be a world first, according to the Yorkshire Post. Three people at the hospital have been trained to perform two specific types of endoscopy under the programme, and more will follow.</p> <p>Graeme Duthie, a consultant surgeon with the trust, said it was a world first for Hull and East Yorkshire and will make a real difference to patients' lives.</p> <p>The three - a nurse, a science graduate and an administrator with no scientific background - were trained during a year-long programme to carry out a colonoscopy and a flexible sigmoidoscopy, which is a more limited examination of the lower part of the colon. During a 14-month period, colonoscopy waiting times were reduced from 18 months to five months and waiting times for the sigmoidoscopy procedure were down from five months to zero.</p> <p>___________________________________________</p> <p>Holidaymakers who want to avoid paying to park their cars at Manchester airport have been abandoning them at a nearby hospital for weeks on end. The problem at Wythenshawe Hospital has become so severe that the parking charges are being increased at the hospital to try and stop it.</p> <p>From next year, the GBP1.50 charge for unlimited parking at the hospital will be scrapped and it will cost GBP10 a day to park there - making it more expensive than the airport's long-stay car park.</p> <p>Paul Featherstone, from the hospital, told the Manchester Evening News: \"During summer, we had a high proportion of illegal car parkers, who park while they go on holiday or business trips. But we couldn't prevent it, because it was difficult to identify who was here as a patient, without asking them.</p> <p>\"This abuse of the system puts severe pressure on our parking system. Now if you park for two weeks, the new charges will be comparable with the airport.\"</p> <p><b>NORTHERN NEWSPAPERS</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk\">This is Lancashire</a><br><a href=\"http://www.thisishull.co.uk\">This is Hull</a><br><a href=\"http://www.news-and-star.co.uk\">News and Star (Cumbria)</a><br><a href=\"http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/\">Liverpool Echo</a><br><a href=\"http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk\">Newcastle Evening Chronicle</a><br><a href=\"http://www.thisisthenortheast.co.uk\">This is the North East</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ypn.co.uk\">Yorkshire Post</a><br><a href=\"http://www.sunderland-echo.co.uk\">Sunderland Echo</a><br><a href=\"http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk\">Manchester Online</a><br><a href=\"http://www.thisisbradford.co.uk\">This is Bradford</a><br><a href=\"http:// www.nwemail.co.uk\">North West Evening Mail</a><br><a href=\"http://www.sheffieldtoday.net\">Sheffield Today</a><br><a href=\"http://icteesside.icnetwork.co.uk/\">icTeesside</a><br><a href=\"http://www.halifaxcouriertoday.co.uk\">Halifax Evening Courier</a><br><a href=\"http://ichuddersfield.icnetwork.co.uk/\">Huddersfield Examiner</a><br><a href=\"http://www.scarboroughtoday.co.uk/\">Scarborough Evening News</a><br><a href=\"http://www.oldham-chronicle.co.uk\">Oldham Evening Chronicle</a><br><a href=\"http://www.cravenherald.co.uk/\">Craven Herald</a><br><a href=\"http://www.thisisthelakedistrict.co.uk\">The Westmorland Gazette</a></p>",

But when her sister is murdered and her daughter kidnapped by Pilgrim, she is forced to act. </p> <p><strong>World's Worst Century: Agincourt</strong><br>9pm, Channel 4 </p> <p>The final documentary in this series centres on the Battle of Agincourt, the brutal climax of the Hundred Years War which took place on October 25 1415. Drawing on records of first-hand accounts, the programme examines how the battle marked a turning point in combat methods between the medieval world and the modern age; with chivalric codes of honour being cast aside for a new, ruthless approach to warfare. The armoured knight had dominated the battlefields of Europe. But at Agincourt, French knights faced an army of motivated individuals instead of the usual mass of feudal serfs. </p> <p><strong>The Sopranos</strong><br>11.30pm, Channel 4 </p> <p>The New York turf struggle dominates events in this episode, with Little Carmine's crew secretly courting Tony Blundetto while Tony Soprano does his very best to steer clear of all such discussions.

  "Sixty Palestinians dead, and one Israeli soldier. Tens of thousands of civilians trapped without electricity or water by the most extensive military occupation of the Gaza Strip since the intifada began four years ago. The demolition of homes, roads and power lines that typically accompanies Israeli assaults on Gaza's refugee camps. <p>Israel's Operation Days of Penitence may seem a disaster for Hamas and its allies. But yesterday it was Ariel Sharon who appeared on the defensive as the battle around Jabaliya, the birthplace of the first Palestinian uprising 17 years ago, evolved into more than a struggle to prevent Hamas launching the rudimentary Qassam rockets that killed two young children in Israel last week. </p> <p>The outcome of the incursion by about 200 tanks, bulldozers and armoured vehicles, backed by helicopters and missile-firing drones, could decide whether Mr Sharon fulfils his pledge to pull thousands of Jewish settlers and Israel's military bases out of the Gaza Strip next year. </p> <p>Hamas has proclaimed the planned Israeli withdrawal a victory for its resistance, and stepped up its attacks to make the point. </p> <p>Hardline settlers, and Mr Sharon's increasingly belligerent opponents in his government and party, agree. They accuse the prime minister of retreating under fire and say that pulling the Jews out of Gaza will encourage more Hamas attacks on Israel once the settlers are gone. </p> <p>Mr Sharon is looking to his closest ally in the government, his defence minister, Shaul Mofaz, to ensure that Israel is seen to leave the Gaza Strip on its own terms. Mr Mofaz has promised a victory that buries any claim that the army has been forced out. </p> <p>\"It is important to make clear to the other side that we will not tolerate terrorist actions or a retreat under fire,\" he said </p> <p>On the streets of Jabaliya, they see it differently. </p> <p>\"Every Qassam they cannot stop is a victory for us,\" said one of Hamas's leaders in northern Gaza, Nizar Rayan, a professor at the Islamic University. </p> <p>\"Every dead Israeli soldier is a victory for us, even if 10 of us die to kill him. Every time Sharon has to send his army to fight on our streets it is a victory for us, because it reminds the Jews why they don't want to be here.\" </p> <p>Like much of the Hamas leadership, he flits from place to place and refuses to speak on a mobile phone. His messages to the population are carried over the mosque loudspeakers: keep off the streets, don't get in the way of our fighters. His orders to the insurgents are sent by runner or text message. </p> <p>The footsoldiers of Hamas shelter in doorways, moving regularly to avoid being spotted by the cameras on the Israeli drones. When the fighting starts, the gunmen encourage the locals to build pyres of rubber which spew out thick black smoke to shield them from the lens in the sky. </p> <p>At the weekend a group of Hamas fighters gathered at a Jabaliya mosque a couple of minutes' walk from Israeli tanks. Before them lay an array of weapons, from imported rocket-propelled grenades to home-made anti-tank shells. </p> <p>\"All our cells are spread out throughout Jabaliya, as part of our plan to kick out the enemy. We will teach the enemy a lesson he will not forget,\" said one of the masked men in black. </p> <p>In Jabaliya they believe in resistance. Palestinians say they support killing the Israeli soldiers protecting the few thousand Jewish settlers who grabbed a quarter of Gaza's land to live in comfort while surrounding more than a million Palestinians with barbed wire and machine gun posts. </p> <p>But ask if they believe in the Qassam rockets and, more particularly, the killing of the two Israeli children - aged two and four - in Sderot last week and people avoid the question. </p> <p>The reply in Jabaliya is the same as the response from Jews in Jerusalem when asked about their army's killing of children in Gaza: look what they do to us. </p> <p>But behind the public face of unity is some frustration, even anger, at Hamas and the retaliation that its rockets bring, although those prepared to express it to an outsider only do so indirectly or with assurances of secrecy. </p> <p>On Saturday Narmi Jnaid was keeping vigil at the side of his mentally and physically disabled young nephew, Bakir, who had just emerged from a two-hour operation to remove Israeli shrapnel from his stomach and kidneys. </p> <p>\"We are in the middle. How can we stop them? We can't stop the Israelis. We can't stop the others,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We want to stop the fighting but it is not in our hands.\" </p> <p>But even among those who would rather that Hamas left Jabaliya there is even greater anger at the Israelis. </p> <p>\"This just creates death, destruction and rage,\" said Raji Sourani, director of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights in Gaza City. \"When the army went into Beit Hanoun, it created many more suicide bombers. </p> <p>\"Israel has occupied Gaza for 37 years and they've never been able to prevent resistance. Now there is more resistance than ever before.\" </p> <p>In the mourning tents dotted every few blocks through Jabaliya there is also anger at the death of innocents. Most of those killed in the past five days are gunmen but the dead include about 15 civilians, among them a 13-year-old boy shot in the head on Saturday. </p> <p>Israel accuses Hamas of endangering civilians by attacking from the cover of residential streets, which Hamas says it does because that is where the tanks are, and of using civilians as human shields. </p> <p>The Israelis do too. When soldiers commandeer Palestinian flats as sniper posts, they frequently pack entire families into the back rooms, in the belief that it will discourage Hamas from blowing up the building. And it does. </p> <p>Israel blames Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority for the Qassam attacks, saying it has done little to curb them. But in these days of conflict, the authority has little influence over either side. </p> <p>The director general of its health ministry, Abdel Barkawi, endured the rage of Jabaliya's residents as he tried to explain that the Israelis simply take no notice of him. </p> <p>\"There are 30,000 people trapped by the Israeli army. They have no electricity, because the first thing the army did was smash the transformers,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Many don't have water, because they rely on electric motors to draw it out of the ground. The Israeli bulldozers are ripping up the sewage pipes.\" </p> <p>\"I speak to the Israelis every day about this. They say: 'There are military operations. Call tomorrow'.\"</p>",
  "<p>General<br> </p> <p><strong>Century City</strong><br>8pm, Sci-Fi </p> <p>Full marks for originality - this new series is something like a cross between LA Law and Buck Rogers. It's set at a go-getting legal firm circa 2030, when cherries have no stones, courtrooms are virtual and futuristic judicial quandaries crop up on a weekly basis: like a 70-year-old boy-band member who won't take his anti-ageing drugs, or a father whose son turns out to be his clone. There are no laser guns or aliens, just a bunch of preppy urbanites, led by Ioan Gruffud, Kristin Lehman and Hector Elizondo. It was cancelled after four episodes in the US, but who knows?

  "Nine law lords will today be asked to decide one of the most important issues to come before the House of Lords, Britain's highest court: can the state lawfully detain a criminal suspect indefinitely without charge or trial? <p>Only once before in recent times have the law lords sat in a panel of nine, a measure of the importance of a case whose outcome is likely to make headlines around the world.</p> <p>The appeal is being brought by foreign terrorist suspects detained without trial under the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001, passed shortly after the September 11 attacks in the US. This allows the indefinite detention of foreign suspects - but not British citizens, who remain entitled to all the safeguards of the criminal process.</p> <p>Britain is a party to the European convention on human rights, which guarantees the right to be brought to trial within a reasonable time or released. The Human Rights Act, which came into force two years ago, made the convention part of British law.</p> <p>The detainees are challenging the lawfulness of Britain's derogation or opt-out from article 5 of the convention, the right to liberty, in order to pass the act.</p> <p>The government argues that the threat from al-Qaida after September 11 amounted to a \"public emergency threatening the life of the nation\", the only circumstance which allows an opt-out from article 5. Britain is the only one of more than 40 countries bound by the human rights convention to suspend the operation of article 5.</p> <p>The detainees' challenge to the lawfulness of the opt-out was initially successful, when the special immigration appeals commission (SIAC) ruled in July 2002 that the suspension was unlawful because it discriminated against foreign nationals.</p> <p>But the court of appeal overturned the ruling in October 2002. The court held that the home secretary, David Blunkett, was entitled to conclude that there was a public emergency threatening the life of the nation, and that there was no unjustifiable discrimination against foreigners because the detainees, unlike British citizens, had no legally enforceable right to remain in the country.</p> <p>So anxious is the government about this week's appeal from that ruling that it is fielding a team of six barristers, including three QCs, led by the attorney general Lord Goldsmith. Among the QCs is Christopher Greenwood, professor of international law at the London School of Economics, whose advice the attorney general relied on in formulating his opinion that the war in Iraq was lawful.</p> <p>In December 2003 a committee of privy counsellors urged the government to repeal the part of the act allowing indefinite detention as \"a matter of urgency\". One of the members, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, a former law lord, later said indefinite detention was \"not a tolerable system in a civilised community\".</p> <p>One of the 12 law lords, Lord Steyn, has been barred from sitting on the appeal, after commenting in a lecture in November 2001: \"In my view, the suspension of article 5 of the European convention on human rights ... is not in present circumstances justified.\"</p> <p>Because of the fundamental importance of the issues, two human rights organisations have been given permission by the law lords to make representations during the four-day hearing, along with the parties in the case.</p> <p>Amnesty International said it had taken the \"extremely rare\" step of intervening to make written submissions because of the issues' \"central importance to the protection of human rights\".</p> <p>The civil rights group Liberty will be putting forward oral and written arguments. Its director, Shami Chakrabarti, who took part in a demonstration by human rights campaigners yesterday outside Belmarsh prison in London, said: \"The use of detention without trial damages the legal system, damages the fight against terrorism and damages Britain's reputation internationally.</p> <p>\"We need an alternative now that ends this injustice.\"</p> <p>Eleven detainees are held under the act, some at Belmarsh. Two others have chosen deportation rather than confinement, as allowed by the legislation.</p> <p>Another was freed on appeal, one is held under house arrest, and an Algerian national was released last month after the home secretary said the evidence no longer justified his detention.</p> <p>The law lords are also being asked to consider whether evidence obtained abroad under torture - possibly from Guantanamo Bay or Abu Ghraib - may be used in indefinite detention cases.</p> <p>The issue arises from a separate court of appeal ruling in August 2004 allowing the use of evidence obtained under torture, as long as Britain neither \"procured nor connived at\" the torture.</p> <p>Lawyers expect the law lords to decide today to defer the torture issue to a future date.</p>",
  "I am a mother in my 40s, and have been living with my boyfriend for a very long time. But I am not married, for one reason only. I don't want to be. <p>I didn't realise the hegemony marriage still holds until a few hours after my first child was born. I was lying in my hospital bed, when a photographer captured my daughter's first few hours. When they asked for my name, I replied, \"Dea Birkett\", so they asked: \"Miss or Mrs?\" I said, \"Miss.\" I was handed a card, which read: \"We also do weddings.\" </p> <p>Even today, the presumption is that mothers want to get married. If they don't, it is because they can't: they are too old, ugly, or unloved. But three children later, the attractions of tying the knot still elude me. The sham begins at the wedding ceremony. The most unpalatable aspect of this costume drama is that it forces the bride and groom to lie. The \"'til death us do part\" promise is meaningless. It is not the same as making an oath that you will never move out of town, drive the family car more than 40mph, or buy a dog - all things you have some control over. Falling in and out of love is unpredictable. Promising to love someone forever is a promise no honest person would make. </p> <p>I hope I will live happily ever after with my non-married man. But the only thing marriage guarantees is that you are more likely to stay married. You don't have to see your spouse for years - you can live in different countries - yet still be married. You don't have to do the decent thing - you can be adulterous or celibate. Happiness and fulfillment are not part of the package. </p> <p>To see this hollow institution as a desirable moral position is laughable. Marriage isn't the gold standard for relationships. Singledom, in which someone is entirely free to leave if the relationship becomes intolerable, is surely a far more principled way to live. </p> <p>I wouldn't presume to recommend living in supposed sin for everyone. But I do wish some people didn't rush so headily up the aisle. Although they may have the best of intentions (squeezing that new dishwasher out of the in-laws or getting their kids into a church school), they are colluding in a system that discriminates against New Spinsters like me. Nor do they try to change it from the inside; I haven't noticed armies of radical marrieds standing up for those couples who choose to stay legally separate. They are getting their tax allowance, pensions, full recognition of their parenthood. What should they care that the rest of us are denied such rights? I am proud that, despite huge financial incentives, I cannot be bought. </p> <p>But what about this thing called love, the blissfully married cry? People kid themselves that marriage is a romantic match. But it is not about individuals. It is about the state sanction of certain kinds of relationship. The couple are immaterial; they are just a means of making sure that bonds are formed between appropriate sets of people - according to class, race, sexuality and disability. Marriages are about the bonding of two clans. Your spouse's family is part of the wedding deal. </p> <p>This marriage of convenience - society's convenience - is not for me. I don't need my class, nor my extended family, nor the state to ratify my relationship. And certainly not a photographer on the maternity ward.</p>",
  "The Bush administration knew as early as mid-2001 that a central plank of its argument about Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction was regarded by its own nuclear experts as probably untrue, it was reported yesterday. <p>The energy department experts said thousands of aluminium tubes purchased by Iraq, and cited by the vice-president, Dick Cheney, as \"irrefutable evidence\" of Saddam's nuclear ambitions, were more likely destined for small-arms manufacture, according to the New York Times. </p> <p>The experts conveyed their doubts to the administration in an intelligence memo dated August 17 2001, but were disregarded in favour of a junior CIA analyst who championed the idea that the tubes were to be used in uranium enrichment, the report said. </p> <p>The tubes, some of which were intercepted, became the basis for the claim by Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, that pre-emptive action was justified because \"we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud\". Unnamed administration officials said Ms Rice and Mr Bush did not know of the doubts until after Ms Rice had made that statement in September 2002. </p> <p>In Iraq, US troops seized control of large parts of Samarra. They said 125 militants had been killed and 88 arrested, although there were also civilian casualties. The US launched another strike in Falluja yesterday, and claimed it had hit a house containing between 10 and 15 \"anti-Iraqi forces\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr is planning to disband his militia, the Mahdi Army and endorse elections scheduled for January, it was reported yesterday. According to the New York Times, Mr Sadr has sent emissaries to some of Iraq's main political and religious groups to discuss fielding candidates.</p>",
  "<p>Education policy should be taken out of the hands of the government and decided by committee of employers, universities, parents and teachers, a conference heard today. </p> <p>There should be no secretary of state for education and no ministers at the head of the Department for Education and Skills, Martin Stephen, the chairman of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), told members at the opening of the annual meeting in St Andrew's today. Instead, he said, there should be a group of practitioners controlling policy.</p> <p>Just as the Bank of England sets the base rate rather than the chancellor, education policy should be decided by experts rather than politicians, he said. </p> <p>Mr Stephen, who is high master of St Paul's School, London, said: \"It is now time that we recognised we have made a great mistake. In accepting that the government is responsible for delivering the educational system, have we not too easily assumed that it must also design it?</p> <p>\"We can never realistically remove, from government, control of spending on education, or responsibility for delivery of the system. Yet isn't it time we took the design of secondary education policy out of the hands of government? Education is a service industry. Who are the end-users of our product? Universities, further education and employers.</p> <p>\"Isn't it time to take educational policy out of the hands of politicians in general, and party politics in particular?\" he asked.</p> <p>Politicians had good intentions, Mr Stephen said, but, he added: \"The truth is that we have an educational system that arouses deep dissent and dissatisfaction, and the final responsibility for that system is held by the successive governments who have redesigned and redesigned our education system so that it bears a resemblance to a wound operated on so often that all that is left is scar tissue.\" </p> <p>The commission would be charged with responsibility for the development of long-term education policy, and of types of school that would last longer than the lifespan of governments, he said.</p> <p>\"Let's start to make our education structures something decided by those who need it, by those who use it and by those who know about it because they work in it. Let's make the politicians' job finding the resources for what we've decided we need,\" said Mr Stephen.</p> <p>The conference continues until Thursday.</p>",
  "<p>Five games into a season is normally too soon to talk about relegation, but with Harlequins it is worth making an exception. After assisting Worcester to their first win in the Zurich Premiership, Harlequins are adrift at the foot of the table and even their own coaches are questioning where a win might come from. </p> <p>They were abject and now have just five training days to pull themselves together before visiting Gloucester. Then Leicester come calling. After that there is the small matter of Munster and Castres in the Heineken Cup before Wasps and Saracens loom on the Premiership horizon. </p> <p>\"It's serious. There's no hiding from it,\" said the Harlequins chief executive and director of rugby, Mark Evans. \"This is as serious as it's been in my time.\" </p> <p>So far this season Harlequins have amassed just two bonus points for keeping the margin of defeat within respectable limits, although Evans denies that they have been compromised by concentrating on developing their ground - already \u00a31m has been spent just getting their proposed new stand to the planning stage - while playing resources have dwindled. </p> <p>Money, he says, could be \"freed up\" but refused to talk about the transfer market. \"I'm not going to sit here and belittle the players by starting to talk about other people.\" </p> <p>However, 11 left Harlequins during the summer, including the influential duo of Jason Leonard and Paul Burke, and their collective nous is sorely missed. And just to rub salt into the wound it was two former Harlequins players and a coach who were at the core of Saturday's defeat. </p> <p>Matt Powell, starting his first game for Worcester at scrum-half, played 20 minutes of sensational rugby and made no attempt to disguise his glee at beating a side which \"allowed him to go\". </p> <p>\"It was great to put one over on them,\" he said after lighting the Worcester flame with a series of breaks, feints, dummies and kicks that led to two tries in 15 minutes. Then Pat Sanderson, who left the Stoop at the end of last year, took on the job of implementing Andy Keast's game plan to the letter. </p> <p>After an eight-try hammering by Sale the previous week, Worcester concentrated on eliminating mistakes. \"The players worked exceptionally hard to be professional enough to take what happened at Sale and put it right,\" said Keast. In truth their resolve was hardly tested as Harlequins struggled to put two phases together. The scrum and the lineout held up, but after that they found a million-and-one ways of funnelling the ball back to the opposition. </p> <p>In the ninth minute Powell charged down a sluggish clearance and Sanderson powered over. Six minutes later Will Greenwood, paired for the first time with Dafydd James, lost the ball in contact and Powell made the break which left Ben Hinshelwood only Gavin Duffy to shrug off. </p> <p>Luke Sherriff, wearing Sanderson's old shirt, pulled a try back, but instead of fading as they have done, Worcester feasted on a supply of errors. </p> <p>Siaosi Vaili, on for Leon Greeff, ploughed through Harlequins' soft centre, and Lee Fortey added the bonus point before Harlequins coughed up the try which epitomised their afternoon. Nineteen points down and into injury time, they tried to run the ball from their line, got barely six strides into the attack before losing the ball to Drew Hickey, who put James Brown in. \"We have a lot of work to do,\" Evans said later. \"We simply never got control. We put the ball into two scrums, what does that tell you? They didn't knock it on, they didn't throw forward passes, they didn't jack it up in contact and we did.\" </p> <p> <strong> Worcester:</strong> Delport; Rasmussen, Hinshelwood, Lombard, Gollings; Brown, Powell (Stuart-Smith, 68); Windo (Sparks 68), Daly, Lyman (Fortey, 56); Collier (Gabey, 52), Gillies; Greeff (Vaili 16, Van Niekert, 70), Sanderson (capt), Hickey. </p> <p><strong> Tries:</strong> Sanderson, Hinshelwood, Vaili, Fortey, Brown. <strong> Cons: </strong> Brown 4. </p> <p><strong> Harlequins:</strong> Duffy; Harder, Greenwood, James, Keogh ( Moyne, 68); Staunton (Dunne, 53), So'oialo; Jones, Tiata, Dawson (Lambert, 67); Rudzki (Palepoi, 68), Miall; Sherriff, Vos (capt), Diprose. </p> <p><strong> Try:</strong> Sherriff. <strong> Con:</strong> Staunton. </p> <p><strong> Sin-bin</strong> : Duffy. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> S Leyshone (Bristol). </p> <p><strong> Attendance:</strong> 7,235.</p>",
  "<p>This week, in one of the most intriguing encounters of the sporting year, a lean 17-year-old Asian student at Bolton Community College and a jowly 52-year-old white businessman from Hertford will meet to discuss the prospect of a shared future. They will be brought together by a brutal business which has always forged the strangest partnerships in the pursuit of glory and money. </p> <p>Amir Khan will bring his Olympic silver medal and the potential to become the most credible saviour of British boxing to the table. Frank Warren just needs to turn up as himself - a man who has survived four bullets from a 9mm pistol, a $12m hit from Don King, a courtroom battle with the VAT man and a showdown with a demented Mike Tyson to remain the master of boxing promotion in this country. </p> <p>Three nights ago in Manchester, before a ferocious display by Warren's current star Ricky Hatton, Khan was paraded as the guest of honour. Warren held Khan's hand high in an imperious stroll around the ring, which was greeted by a foot-stomping ovation. Even after Hatton's stunning fifth-round victory it was hard not to be diverted by a grinning Khan and Warren as they coyly evaded the subject of working together. </p> <p>While Khan is likely to remain an amateur a little while longer, the logic of the ring suggests he and Warren will eventually sign a deal which could transform the fight game in this country. \"I obviously watched Amir very closely on Friday night,\" Warren admits. \"He got a tremendous reception and he was caught up in the whole atmosphere. You could just tell that he's destined for superstardom.\" </p> <p>If King pursued a fighter as talented as Khan, he would arrange a midnight rendezvous in a hotel room so he could arrive with a suitcase stashed full of cash. The Don would tell the boy from Bolton to count each note as \"a gift\" from the greatest promoter in history. King, of course, would also pledge wild allegiance to Bolton and Pakistan, while outlining a grand campaign to sell Amir Khan as an improbable combination of Muhammad Ali, Sam Allardyce and the Aga Khan. Frank Warren's style is more subtle and pragmatic. </p> <p>\"Maybe we can work out some sort of compromise,\" he suggests with revealing flexibility. \"I'm not just interested in dragging Amir away from amateur boxing. I'm more interested in the long-term picture.\" </p> <p>Warren would love to start promoting Khan as a professional boxer this morning. Yet he is too astute to believe that excessive arm-twisting or blustering rhetoric will sway such a composed fighter. Warren has kept his distance while the Amateur Boxing Association has struggled to improve its offer of a \u00a340,000 grant, to persuade Khan that his preference to win an Olympic title before turning pro can be attained without undue economic strain. The few snippets Warren has released in public have, meanwhile, reminded Khan that he could expect to be a millionaire and a world champion in the professional ring before the Beijing games of 2008. </p> <p>Even if he fails to persuade Khan to turn professional immediately, Warren hopes to find an imaginative way of attaining some sort of promotional hold over his future. Although he sidesteps speculation that Khan could box as an amateur on his professional promotions, or that he might support the ABA's sponsorship of Khan in exchange for future contractual rights, Warren relishes thinking more laterally than is usual for a boxing deal. </p> <p>He might stalk Khan in public with a gentle smile and soft patter but, alone with the fighter's entourage, he will present a steely resolve and a lucrative commercial package. \"The first thing they're going to be interested in is money,\" Warren says of the boxer, his father Shajaad Khan and his lawyer Asif Vali. \"But boxing is not all about money. I'll suggest they look at Audley Harrison - an Olympic gold medallist who has done a Pop Idol in reverse. The important thing for Amir, when he decides to turn pro, is the kind of people he chooses around him. He needs to look at their track record and decide whether they can pick opponents and promote a fighter and if they have the connections to deliver a world title. There is an art to this game . . .\" </p> <p>The artistry becomes plain when Warren explains his pitch to Khan. \"If I was in his position I would ask myself, 'What's the best and safest route for me as a boxer?' If he stays where he is, he's going to be matched against the toughest amateurs in the world, who are the equal of some good professionals. Do you fight them for nothing or do you go for the money? If a 17-year-old youngster has a God-given talent, why shouldn't he go out and use it to secure his future? Wayne Rooney is the benchmark of precocious talent. His hat-trick last week told us again that it doesn't matter how old you are when you've got the gift.\" </p> <p>Warren stops short of calling Khan the Wayne Rooney of boxing - he already used that comparison last October when introducing his brilliant 18-year-old featherweight Kevin Mitchell to the pro ranks. While his belief in Mitchell is undimmed, Warren's pursuit of Khan is made even more credible by his measured assessment. </p> <p>\"After only 12 senior contests he was fighting seasoned amateur veterans and doing a right job on them. Even in the Olympic final, when he fought a great Cuban [Mario Kindelan], he came very close. I'm not saying he won the fight but it was tighter than the scoring suggested. If he's doing that at 17, what will he be like at 21?\" </p> <p>Warren warns, however, that the unpredictability of boxing could yet ruin Khan's Olympic ambition. \"What happens if he goes over to Beijing and gets injured? As a pro we'd demand a postponement. They're not going to postpone the Olympics.\" </p> <p>He is contemptuous of any suggestion that Khan's move into professional boxing might be influenced by Naseem Hamed - another former prodigy who fell out bitterly with Warren and has now spoken at length to the young amateur. </p> <p>\"I like Naz but here's a guy who went from Park Lane to Brick Lane. Naseem lost the plot completely. His brother Riath [who succeeded Warren as Hamed's promoter] once asked, 'Why can't Naz fight once a year?' I said, 'Because he's a fat bastard. He needs to be kept in the gym.' Those guys don't know their arse from their elbow.\" </p> <p>Warren is as dismissive of British boxing's previous Olympic hero. \"Audley Harrison is a complete joke. It's ridiculous. Four years have passed since he won gold and he's still not fought for the British title. I tried to set up a fight between him and Matt Skelton [Warren's unbeaten British heavyweight]. But I've been around an awful lot of boxers over the years and, with Audley, you could just tell. He doesn't fancy a real fight.\" </p> <p>Danny Williams, in contrast, risked everything in a contest he fancied from the start - against Tyson. \"When Danny came into my office I said, 'The good news is you're fighting Mike Tyson. The bad news is you're not even getting $250,000.' But I also said, 'Danny, you can win this. You'll get vintage Tyson for a round-and-a-half but, if you survive that, then I promise you he'll go.'\" </p> <p>Warren's close, if complex, relationship with his fighters is typified by his association with Williams. \"I've known Danny a long time. He signed with me on day one and I remember him coming close to pulling out of a fight on one of my shows because he was so nervous. He then went to work with King. People were blowing sugar up his arse but in the end he came back to me. I said to him before he fought Tyson, 'Dan, you're your own worst enemy. You've got to fight that demon inside you. If you win that battle you can beat anyone.'\" </p> <p>For Warren, who briefly promoted Iron Mike and withstood a hotel room confrontation which left him cut, bruised but apparently undaunted, \"there's no doubt that Tyson in the first round is still a terrifying prospect. He hit Danny with some real bombs. But Danny took it all and showed us what he can do when his mind is right.\" </p> <p>Warren, in another example of promotional ingenuity, has since negotiated Williams's next huge fight - against Vitali Klitschko, the IBF champion regarded as the world's best heavyweight. The giant Ukrainian will present a less explosive but more exacting challenge than Tyson when he defends his title against Williams on December 11. \"Klitschko is still far from invincible. Look at the way he lost to a journeyman like Ross Purity. He's big and upright - so Danny needs to be mobile and use all the angles. If the same guy who beat Tyson turns up against Klitschko, then he's got a fantastic chance.\" </p> <p>Another Williams win would also mark the end of Warren's recent promotional struggle - which, only a few months ago, saw Hatton threaten to walk away from boxing after numerous \"defining fights\" set up by Warren had fallen apart. The promoter now purrs at the possibilities. By mid-December he could control the dominant heavyweight in boxing while securing a deal with Khan and groundbreaking fights for Hatton and Joe Calzaghe, whom he describes as the best British boxer he has ever promoted. </p> <p>Fifteen years will also have passed since the fateful night, on November 30 1989, when Warren was gunned down by an unknown hitman in east London. Since then he has lost a $12m lawsuit to King and been stripped of his right to be a company director for seven years. Yet Warren was also cleared by a jury on a \u00a31.2m VAT charge, has settled his King debt and is eligible again to serve as a director in any business. </p> <p>The night he was almost murdered marked the start of that troubled cycle. \"The last 15 years have been a rollercoaster. If the shooting hadn't happened my work on the London Arena would never have collapsed and many subsequent problems would have been avoided. It was hard but, you know, I'm a bit of a fighter myself. I don't want to tempt fate but everything seems more stable now.\" </p> <p>Warren is engagingly candid when admitting that he actively discourages all six of his children from following him into a business as disreputable as boxing. He also speaks poignantly about some missed opportunities. \"I left my local grammar school [in Islington] at the age of 14. I was quite bright and would've loved to have gone to university. I never got that chance. I often wish I had ended up in the arts. I love art and it would've been fantastic if I had been given a chance to go into that world . . .\" </p> <p>I believe him. But I also know Warren was made for the dirty old game. He still has not lost his voracious hunger to find the next great fighter. I give him a wry little smile as I ask one last time if he thinks Amir Khan will soon fight for him. \"If I was him,\" Warren says without missing a trick, \"I would . . .\"</p>",
  "<p>Here is an interesting fact about Ofcom's 137-page document on the future of public service broadcasting in the digital age: the word internet appears twice. Both mentions are fleeting and tangential. </p> <p>One might think this is rather odd for a document about the future of public service communications - particularly one that has as its centre-piece a proposal to hypothecate \u00a3300m to \u00a3400m to set up a new \"public service publisher\". But it gives a clue to what lies at the centre of the Ofcom proposals as a whole. </p> <p>The internet was, after all, left out of Ofcom's portfolio of responsibilities when the regulator was established two years ago. Along with the BBC. Neither was a surprising omission - the internet is, by its nature, largely ungovernable, and the BBC has its own system of independent regulation in the form of the governors. </p> <p>Ofcom's \"phase 2\" document on public service broadcasting is a coherent critique of the present state of television and an imaginative stab at solutions for the near future. It observes that the traditional motivations of commercial public service broadcasters - access to spectrum - is dwindling as digital takes hold. In other words, ITV, Channel 4 and Five will join the internet in becoming ever more ungovernable as they cease to broadcast from earth-bound licences and become just another stem in the multichannel bouquet. </p> <p>So hang on - here you have Ofcom, ruler supreme of TV regulation, which a) does not regulate the BBC, and b) will soon be robbed of many of its functions in regulating the remaining broadcasters. Its grip on digital spectrum is tenuous and when programmes are all distributed over broadband internet connections - which will happen - then this too will leave its statutory ambit. So what will it do apart from issue ringtone directives? Enter the new big idea - the public service publisher (PSP). </p> <p>This is the new entity that will compete with the BBC because, apparently, the BBC needs competition to make it better at public service broadcasting, and it is not getting this from the increasingly commercial output of Channel 4 or ITV. The funding for this, which may come from direct taxation or the licence fee, will need to be administered and monitored by a body not a million miles away from Ofcom. </p> <p>Furthermore the PSP will employ exciting new distribution technologies (all web-based, but again the \"i\" word is left implicit rather than explicit) to put its content in front of the general public. So what Ofcom will achieve, if it persuades the government to adopt its recommendations, is a marvellous new job creation scheme for - Ofcom! It potentially allows the regulator into the world of public service provision from which it would otherwise be excluded and it gives Ofcom theoretical control over electronically disseminated content even though it does not have any jurisdiction over the internet. </p> <p>You are unlikely to read many bad words about the PSP because, potentially, it allows all manner of media organisations - including this one - to compete for public money. And while I look forward to presenting my own panoply of ideas to the Ofcom board, it would be disingenuous to say there are no flaws in this new proposal. </p> <p>The central contention that the BBC \"needs\" competition to be better at public service broadcasting is the most obviously incorrect. The theory that competition equals improvement is sound. But it is not necessarily the case that provision is always improved by competition. This has not been true of the railways, is not true of the NHS and is absolutely not true of education. Like these other public services, the BBC needs scrutiny and corrective action when it under-delivers, but it does not need competition to make better programmes or deliver better services. One could argue that two of its most public servicey jewels - Radio 4 and BBC Online - have flourished in the face of minimal competition (except, of course, from Guardian Unlimited which the BBC tries, but fails, to emulate on a daily basis). The biggest criticism of the BBC in recent times has been that it is too competitive rather than too complacent. </p> <p>There remains an enormous and largely untackled issue over the on-demand future of public service TV, namely access to and distribution of the BBC's archive. Money ringfenced for the PSP would be far better spent on the realisation of our \"back catalogue\" rather than firing yet more content at a shrinking right-here, right-now audience. Putting the PSP into an already overserved market will be a waste of good money and a bureaucracy generator par excellence. </p> <p>The fracturing of linear TV and the inevitable decline of the schedule is one element that Ofcom has touched on and will address with its new PSP, although it is wisely vague on the detail of how this might be achieved. But again it allows Ofcom to inch onto the beachhead of new technology. Analogue is dead, long live Ofcom!</p>",
  "<p>For the first time since his appointment as the Press Complaints Commission's in-house watchdog, Sir Brian Cubbon has overruled a PCC decision. Though the commission had previously washed its hands of a complaint against the Sunday Telegraph, he used his powers as charter commissioner to order the paper to carry a clarification that went some way to undermining a contentious story published five months before. </p> <p>Cubbon's decision is just one intriguing aspect of a case which highlights how frustrating and futile it can be to make a complaint to the PCC. It also casts new light on the supposed restrictions of the appeals procedure. </p> <p>The saga began with the Sunday Telegraph's publication of two articles in April - one on the front page - aimed at embarrassing Will Hutton, chief executive of the Work Foundation and best-selling author of economics books. </p> <p>Hutton was described as a \"leading critic of housing profiteers\" who was enjoying the benefits of being married to a property developer alleged to have \"made a fortune out of selling and renting inner-city properties, often at rates which local council housing officers describe as exorbitant\". </p> <p>Hutton's wife, Jane Atkinson, was identified as the head of a company called First Premise which \"had accumulated profits of \u00a3938,977 in the year ending 2002\". She was also said to own 25% of the company. </p> <p>The Daily Telegraph, obviously accepting the stories at face value, then used them as a peg to publish a trenchant leading article which accused Hutton of hypocrisy. He had feathered his own nest, it suggested, while advocating constraints on the free market on behalf of the poor. </p> <p>Atkinson and her three fellow directors at First Premise were outraged by the Sunday Telegraph story, believing that it impugned the reputation of their company which, far from being a property empire, is dedicated to small-scale regeneration. So a director, Peter Gittins, fired off a four-page letter to the editor, Dominic Lawson, claiming that the articles had misrepresented the company's activities and were full of inaccuracies. He pointed out that Hutton had no connection with the company except through marriage to one director, asked for retractions of \"misleading facts\" and demanded an apology. </p> <p>The paper responded that though it was prepared to carry a letter, it would not publish an apology or correction. First Premise thought a letter would be inadequate recompense and made a formal complaint to the PCC on May 22. </p> <p>The PCC makes much of its \"fast, free and fair\" slogan, but the affair dragged on for two months as the commission tried to broker a deal. </p> <p>On July 19, First Premise was astonished to receive a letter from the PCC saying that the company should have accepted the paper's offer of a letter and that there was nothing more to be done. But, if the company was dissatisfied at the way the complaint had been handled, it could take it up with the \"independent charter commissioner\". </p> <p>First Premise's directors were not satisfied and contacted Cubbon, a former permanent secretary at the Home Office appointed as charter commissioner in January following the reforms introduced by the incoming PCC chairman, Sir Christopher Meyer. Cubbon's brief is to investigate allegations of procedural irregularity. He is not supposed to reconsider the substance of the PCC's decision. </p> <p>So, in this case, what procedural irregularities did Cubbon discover? He is keeping his own counsel, but a PCC source did shed some light, suggesting that he had taken the view that the separation between substance and process, or handling as Cubbon is said to call it, is far from clear. </p> <p>For example, it was thought that the July 19 letter from the PCC to Gittins could have been construed as illogical and failed to offer the complainant proper redress. It was therefore a defective response and Cubbon decided that the Sunday Telegraph's letter offer wasn't sufficient. It should carry an editorial clarification which, in essence, amounted to a correction. </p> <p>It finally stated that First Premise's \u00a3938,977 profits were accumulated over 16 years, putting the allegation of a \"fortune\" in a different perspective. Indeed, it removed the very foundation of the piece. The paper was also forced to retract insinuations in its articles about properties having been bought at a discount. </p> <p>Evidently, the Sunday Telegraph is not too upset at publishing the 103-word correction at the bottom of page two some five months after devoting far more space to the subject. Its editorial executives continue to view the story as legitimate and its editor has not seen fit to apologise to Hutton. </p> <p>Nor, indeed, has the Daily Telegraph seen the error of its leading article. A letter for publication sent by Hutton following the PCC's climbdown has not appeared. </p> <p>Similarly, the PCC's director, Tim Toulmin, is said to be \"very relaxed\" about Cubbon's reversal of the commission's original decision. \"It shows that our long-stop appeals procedure is working,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p>Am I alone in thinking the episode leaves a nasty taste? </p> <p><strong>Who shot the Mail messenger?</strong></p> <p>Why did Channel 4 suddenly decide to abandon a documentary on the Daily Mail, presented by Fiona Millar? She had been working enthusiastically on the project for months along with an independent production company, Hardcash, after the TV channel had provided \u00a313,000 in development money. </p> <p>No one at Channel 4 has been able to offer Millar an explanation that makes any sense. There were vague references to there being \"nothing new\" in her material though, given that TV viewers seldom get the opportunity to see anything much about the Mail, that seems a weak excuse. </p> <p>According to Channel 4's head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, there weren't \"sufficient grounds editorially\". Sufficient grounds? Does she think the Daily Mail's editor, Paul Dacre, worries over sufficient grounds to attack Channel 4, as his paper often does? </p> <p>The sad truth is that Channel 4 has missed an opportunity to explain how Britain's most successful modern paper manages so often to set the political and social agenda. </p> <p> <strong> Corner shops' vanishing point</strong><br> Most people, and that includes journalists, don't care enough about how their newspapers reach them. After all, papers seem to be available everywhere - in supermarkets, at petrol stations and in airport lounges. </p> <p>That may appear fine at first glance, but the spread of newspaper sales points hides a dispiriting trend because those traditional purveyors, the corner shop newsagents, have been feeling the squeeze. </p> <p>Worse still, from May next year, in dependent newsagents face a further threat from new competition legislation that could lead to the end of the distribution system through wholesalers, who now enjoy what amount to regional monopolies. </p> <p>It may be ironic that newspaper proprietors, who routinely argue on behalf of a deregulated free market, should support the current set-up. But they are convinced that the territorial monopolies must be defended. </p> <p>To that end, the owners' body, the National Publishers Association, has joined forces with magazine owners, wholesalers and thousands of retailers to lobby the government for a block exemption from the new \"free trade\" law. Their argument is founded on the belief that the current system works efficiently by ensuring that papers not only reach the furthest parts of the British Isles every morning, but that every buyer can obtain them at the same price. </p> <p>The case was powerfully argued at a Labour conference fringe meeting, not least by the circulation director of Associated Newspapers, Mike Newman, who fears that a supermarket group or big retail chain could use the law to challenge the traditional system. Like other distribution experts, he believes that the dismantling of the territorial monopolies would gradually lead to inadequate distribution of papers. \"What's at risk\", he says, \"is our diverse and pluralistic press\". I hope the trade secretary, Patricia Hewitt, is listening. </p> <p> <strong> Hearst's lair</strong><br> On a trip to California - which allowed Boris Johnson to \"borrow\" my column so entertainingly - I visited the castle built by William Randolph Hearst. As its many visitors often remark, the folly is a tribute to his grandiosity and a fitting legacy to the man portrayed as Citizen Kane. </p> <p>Our guide knew a great deal about the old man, pointing out that a cou ple of hours before he was found dead, aged 89, he was overheard on the phone buying yet more works or art. </p> <p>\"I guess that's what they mean by shop 'til you drop,\" she said. </p> <p> <strong> Hush puppies</strong><br> Further up the coast is Carmel, famed for Clint Eastwood's recent mayoralty. According to the sheriff's log, recorded in the local paper, the most frequent complaint is about barking dogs. Evidently, errant owners don't need a second warning with a movie gun-slinger around.</p>",

  "<p>Stephen Lambert, the king of factual entertainment, finds it hard to sit down for long. But he's especially on edge now because he and his company are joining a tiny elite band of British television producers. Lambert and his indy RDF seem to have a major American network hit on their hands for the first time with a US version of Wife Swap on ABC. If so it's a life changing - if not life swapping - moment. </p> <p>Last Wednesday's US premiere attracted 11.1 million viewers, improving on a sneak preview the previous Sunday of 10.9 million. It had a virtual tie with the veteran Law &amp; Order in the one demographic that matters, 18-49 year olds, and won the battle for 18-34 year old women. It is also a glorious riposte to Fox TV, which rushed out a derivative version called Trading Spouses this summer. </p> <p>In six years as the director of programmes, Lambert, 45, a classically-trained BBC documentary maker, has helped drive RDF to become the UK's second largest independent producer. It was the Birtist regime and the introduction of producer choice that finally drove him out to entrepreneurial fortune and RDF now has a \u00a353m turnover - its offices in West Kensington vie in scale with Channel 4's. </p> <p>This week he's back in LA to find out if ABC is going to bump up the Wife Swap order from 20 to 30 shows. He describes how he came up with the idea - first screened on Channel 4 in 2003 - at an RDF ideas meeting. </p> <p>\"We were looking at things like an article in the Daily Mail about how a nurse on \u00a315,000 lived, compared with a barrister on \u00a3200,000. What about them swapping lives, then what about a wife swap? ... no we couldn't do it. Then we thought hang on, there are separate bedrooms. We embarked on it. </p> <p>\"So many of our shows are commissioned on no more than an idea. All the detail that makes them work comes from getting under way and from the talented people who are thinking about it all the time. You evolve the format while making the first episodes. </p> <p>\"One of our frustrations is that some commissioners want all that to be worked out before you embark, and you almost lose the will to live.\" </p> <p>Lambert is dismissive of the John Humphrys argument that reality television is debasing society. \"How proud I'd have been as a documentary maker, say working on Modern Times [his last BBC2 series], if I had captured young men talking to each other frankly about sex. It is true, perfectly valid. </p> <p>\"I don't mind being bracketed with Big Brother. There are good and bad examples, good dramas, good news programmes, bad reality, bad dramas, bad news. As a genre, reality television is one way of telling us stories about human nature and in many ways it is often more honest than observational documentary.\" </p> <p>That's a dig at Paul Watson who claims to have invented people programmes, and last week, in a Daily Mail article, attacked reality television, including Wife Swap, as having \"nothing at all to do with reality\". </p> <p>Why? \"Because it says at the outset this is a construct. It is only happening because we've arranged it, but look how people's nature is revealed because of the situation we've put them in. A lot of observational documentary implicitly pretends this is how it is and we have merely observed it when very often the director and people making the programme have manipulated things in order to be able to film something interesting.\" </p> <p>Examples? \"You tend to hide that if you are the person making it. We've had a lot of fantastic documentary directors working on things like Faking It and Wife Swap and they come to make the shows because they feel they can use all their documentary skills, and because they are guaranteed a beginning, middle and end. They are formats that give you those narrative structures, but still there's an enormous variety and unpredictability about what will happen in them. </p> <p>\"The frustration of making observational documentaries is that it is very hard to find situations in the real world that have a beginning, middle and end, and if they do it is very hard to be there for all the key moments. Obviously there have been fantastic observational documentaries but it is very hard to pull off.\" </p> <p>What's been so difficult making Wife Swap in America - Lambert is one of three executive producers - is that it's very hard to find observational documentary makers there who are also capable of making popular television. \"We're using a mixture of British documentary directors and American production talent. We're making it, and we edit it here, in London. I wanted to be on top of it. </p> <p>\"In America the broadcasters never had observational documentaries, unlike in Britain. The US is split between East Coast news divisions, reporter driven, with no interest in capturing natural dialogue, and the West Coast where there is scripted TV, drama and comedy. Until recently there was this little department at the end of the corridor called alternative programming, to do Bob Hope tributes and awards ceremonies. Then, five years ago, ABC and CBS's alternative departments commissioned Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? and Survivor.\" </p> <p>But the American networks have tended to go for shows in artificial environments which are heavily produced and very carefully plotted. </p> <p>Lambert says: \"There's not a great emphasis on spontaneity and authenticity. That's why Wife Swap is so unusual. It is in real people's homes. None of the US commissioning people would order a docusoap just following characters, there's not enough guaranteed at the outset, but they looked at Wife Swap and saw there was enough of a format to guarantee emotion, drama, all the rest of it.\" </p> <p>The UK version of Wife Swap, which returns on October 17, has been influenced by the US version, which runs for 43 minutes compared with C4's 48, and is broken up into seven acts around six commercial breaks. </p> <p>\"The last act is only two minutes. What they asked us to do is what's happened since the end of filming, six weeks later. When we showed them to Channel 4 they said we want them in our British show. It's amazing that now I go back to watching the British ones and I think, oh it's so slow, why isn't there more music?\" </p> <p>It is also due to bigger budgets - the British version costs less than \u00a3150,000, and the American version costs $750,000. Lambert says that the background checks, blood tests and psychological analysis are incredibly rigorous, as are the massive legal contracts signed by contributors. \"You have to wonder if the process will get tougher as people wise up. They have no right to prevent transmission, if people start playing up to camera you stop it.\" </p> <p>Lambert and RDF's chief executive David Frank face an interesting strategic decision over whether to diversify. \"We think that it makes more commercial sense to concentrate on the area we do best, principally factual entertainment. I see no evidence that it is running out of steam.\"</p>",
  "<p>The sport of kings has enjoyed a less than regal year. Aside from allegations about race fixing and the ongoing spat between the traditional bookmakers and new internet services such as Betfair, the financial viability of horse racing has been threatened by the confusion surrounding its media rights deals. </p> <p>Back in March the \u00a3307m agreement that 49 of the UK's 59 racecourses had with AttheRaces, a consortium launched at the height of the dotcom boom by BSkyB, Channel 4 and Arena Leisure, collapsed just two years into a 10-year deal. The supposedly landmark deal handed over all UK media rights to the consortium but ambitious plans for a dedicated racing channel and broadband website foundered when fewer punters than expected could be persuaded to bet through interactive television and the web. </p> <p>It soon became clear that the numbers didn't add up and AttheRaces pulled the plug on the deal, invoking a clause regarding the proportion of betting revenue it received. Channel 4 then withdrew from the consortium, leaving BSkyB and Arena to sign new deals with half of the UK's courses. </p> <p>But many of the biggest courses, including Cheltenham, Newmarket and Epsom, snubbed AttheRaces mark two and decided to set up their own channel. Racing UK, the company they set up, marks the first time that a major sport has taken control of its own rights in this country. </p> <p>Racing UK has recruited a group of experienced broadcasting executives and hopes to avoid repeating the mistakes of the last deal by focusing on launching a subscription channel costing \u00a320 a month rather than relying on interactive betting revenue. It also plans to launch a broadband-enabled website and mobile service within six months, but chief executive Andrew Brown is adamant that the new venture will avoid the ultimately fatal hubris that characterised AttheRaces' first venture. </p> <p>\"I was brought on board in March with a question mark over what we could do. We wanted to look at the possibilities for racing to own its own channel. From there it was a case of establishing the business plan quite quickly and then talking to the other race courses about coming together to run a channel by racing, for racing,\" says Brown, a former head of business development at Granada. \"What we were offering was control. In the aftermath of ceding control of media rights there was a recognition for racing to have control of its own destiny,\" he adds. </p> <p>Former MusicChoice chief Simon Bazalgette was recruited as chairman and Will Wyatt, a racing enthusiast and former senior BBC executive, was made a director. </p> <p>\"We're establishing and protecting the rights on behalf of the race courses in a way that has never really been done before,\" says Bazalgette. \"Andrew, Will and I all come from a media background where the establishment of rights is critical and we've discovered there are lots of areas that haven't been thought about very carefully.\" </p> <p>To that end Racing UK is suing SIS, a company that provides race information to foreign markets and has a deal with AttheRaces. It alleges that SIS is illegally selling commentaries and coverage from its courses. The sale of overseas rights is also a revenue stream that Racing UK expects to exploit. </p> <p>The new channel went subscription only from last Friday and features racing from 30 courses, including 11 of the 12 main courses in the UK. Ascot is the notable exception. But huge hurdles remain, not least the fact that it is competing with the reborn version of AttheRaces, which remains free to air. To add a further layer of intrigue, AttheRaces has offered its courses immunity from the \u00a351.3m legal action it is launching against the courses, which it believes still owe it money under the previous deal. \"That was the stick that was used to round them up. It was a leap of faith from that point of view [to sign with Racing UK], but one that we believe is paying off handsomely,\" says Brown. </p> <p>There are also doubts over whether enough racing enthusiasts can be persuaded to part with \u00a3240 a year to watch coverage that was previously free. The Racing UK team argues that for committed gamblers, used to betting \u00a350 a time, the subscription will not seem expensive. The plan is that Racing UK will make 40% of its revenues from subscription, 40% from the sale of international rights and the rest from advertising and sponsorship. </p> <p>It is also negotiating with bookmakers to offer subsidised subscriptions as an incentive to sign up new punters. \"It's a classic premium sports subscription play,\" says Bazalgette, adding that he expects to sign up 20,000 subscribers within the next 12 to 18 months, taking the channel to break even. </p> <p>\"The experience of AttheRaces taught the courses many things, but one of the things was the lesson that television presence and the way you use your media rights is key to the overall health of the sport,\" adds Brown. </p> <p>While other sports bodies, notably the Premier League, have in the past threatened to launch their own channels as a negotiating tactic, none have followed it through until now. Wyatt believes that it could mark a watershed moment for sports bodies who have in some cases come off worse from the Faustian pacts they have signed with broadcasters over the past five years - ceding absolute control in return for previously unheard of riches. Now that the sports rights gravy train has hit the buffers, he believes others could follow racing's lead. </p> <p>\"It's worth pointing out that the original AttheRaces was as much about the desire of Sky to have an interactive service and Channel 4's own business needs as it was about the needs of racing,\" he says. Brown adds: \"The original AttheRaces was obliged to follow an entertainment model - they had to give it a broader, slightly fuzzier appeal. We can be much more racing-focused.\" </p> <p>But some in the sports broadcasting world have questioned whether the courses will be able to succeed where Sky and its partners failed. Bazalgette believes that internet and mobile rights will become increasingly important to racing but, again, is determined to avoid the over-reliance on interactive betting that hobbled AttheRaces first time round. </p> <p>\"We'll launch a broadband service within the next week or so and we're in discussions with a range of people that will allow us to do some sophisticated things,\" he says. This could involve selling web rights separately to bookmakers and ISPs as incentives to sign up. A mobile service is also due to launch within the next six months. </p> <p>The story of horse racing's relationship with rights holders over the past two years will no doubt provide enough material for a sizeable chapter when the book comes to be written on the overconfidence of both broadcasters and new media companies in exploiting the pulling power of sport. But the new Racing UK venture signals a back-to-basics approach that has been mirrored in post dotcom bust businesses. \"People had lost their faith with what had happened previously. They are now in it for the long term,\" insists Brown.</p>",
  "<p>On occasions during Brian Little's early managerial career he would have raged over certain perceived injustices such as late equalisers and poor officiating. Not now. </p> <p>Although frustrated that Tranmere had just failed to become the first team this season to defeat the team at the top of League One, he saw a great deal during a pulsating 90 minutes from which to take heart. </p> <p>Luton arrived with a fearsome reputation having taken 28 points from the first 30 available. Yet they were fortunate to be able to clamber back on to the team bus with their unbeaten record intact. </p> <p>Tranmere had taken the lead when Ryan Taylor smuggled the ball past the Luton goalkeeper Dino Seremet after a twice-taken penalty, but they paid for missing a number of opportunities when Chris Coyne levelled late on. </p> <p>Not for the first time this season, Little was left to reflect on how Tranmere did not get their just deserts. To make matters worse, Tranmere, for all their good work, even slipped a position to third in the table. </p> <p>Little, however, was a man in control of his emotions. \"I'm delighted to be in this position,\" he insisted, knowing his side have lost only once themselves. \"We are probably three or four points off where we should be, but it's a nice disappointment to have. Some people will get frustrated when you don't win a match like that, but we have proved that we are a reasonably good side.\" </p> <p>The main talking point was Taylor's goal. The referee Tony Bates was correct to award a penalty after the Tranmere full-back had been pole-axed by Coyne. What followed, though, was chaotic. </p> <p>Bates ordered Taylor off the pitch even though he did not need treatment, leaving Ian Hume to take the kick. Seremet saved but a retake was ordered because the goalkeeper was adjudged to have moved off his line. Taylor was allowed to take the second penalty, but he, too, saw Seremet plunge to his right to save. However, Taylor pounced on the rebound to turn the ball in from six yards. </p> <p>\"I have been in the game a long, long time and have never seen anything like that before,\" said Little. \"I was bemused, as was everyone else, with the outcome. It's just a good job that I'm old and take things in my stride now.\" </p> <p>The Luton manager Mike Newell was rather more animated on the touchline than Little and afterwards was enraged that his side had been hard done by. </p> <p>\"It must be massively frustrating for the keeper to save it twice and yet still concede a goal,\" he grumbled. \"The game is being dissected day in, day out. Officials sit there watching it and like to get involved. They were very poor.\" </p> <p>So were Luton for much of the game. But they hung on to snatch a point through Coyne's header, and Newell was thrilled with the way his side refused to buckle under a late onslaught. </p> <p>\"They have got that belief that they are unbeatable,\" said Newell. \"This is a fantastic run the lads have put together. This was a big test. We came here with nothing and left with a point.\" </p> <p><strong> Man of the match:</strong> Ryan Taylor (Tranmere Rovers)</p>",
  "<p>Manchester United used to have the biggest and most blas\u00e9 crowds in the country. Now they are just the biggest. A record Premiership attendance shoehorned into Old Trafford to see Wayne Rooney but he fell short of his most exhilarating peaks and there was no disguising the Mancunian melancholy engulfing the stadium at the end. </p> <p>The disappointment was inevitable given that Arsenal's form makes the nine-point gap feel like a chasm. Only the most pessimistic United supporter could have envisaged they would be so far behind while the leaves were still dropping from the trees and the sense of despair was compounded here by the fact that their opponents arrived with half their usual team missing. </p> <p>To put Middlesbrough's performance into perspective, Mark Viduka, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Franck Queudrue, Ray Parlour, Michael Reiziger and Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Job were all absent. Hence their right flank comprised a full-back, Tony McMahon, and a winger, James Morrison, who were making their first Premiership starts, while on the bench was another member of their FA Youth Cup-winning team, Andrew Taylor, and a fourth teenager, Danny Graham, who spent last season on loan at Darlington. </p> <p>In the circumstances their manager Steve McClaren could reflect upon a hugely satisfying day's work. \"It's one of the most memorable performances I have seen from my side in three years at the club,\" he said. \"I'm so proud of the players because I don't think anybody who saw our team-sheet before the game would have given us any hope. Nobody would have given us a prayer.\" </p> <p>McClaren is actually entitled to feel slightly aggrieved that Middlesbrough did not emerge with their third victory here in four seasons and his fifth against Sir Alex Ferguson in eight meetings. When they led through Stewart Downing's breakaway goal just after the half-hour, Gaizka Mendieta had a splendid chance to double that lead as Boudewijn Zenden's clever dummy left him with a clear sight at Roy Carroll's goal in the 63rd minute. Despite having time to control the ball and pick his spot, Mendieta's usual composure failed him and his miss was the catalyst for United's first prolonged spell of second-half pressure, culminating in Alan Smith's late equaliser. </p> <p>Smith, a substitute, had been on the pitch only 13 minutes and his expertly taken header from Cristiano Ronaldo's cross was the ideal way to remind Ferguson that, with six goals in 12 games, he could hardly have done more to justify a place in the starting XI. Smith's performance bristled with indignation and his sympathisers might also have noted that Rooney and Ruud van Nistelrooy could only manage one shot on target between them. </p> <p>That is not to say Rooney had a bad game. The teenager was among Ferguson's busier players, continually linking up midfield and attack, but there was a marked difference from his performance against Fenerbahce in the Champions League last Tuesday. \"Young Wayne was maybe a bit tired,\" Ferguson offered by way of explanation. \"Last week was his first game for 96 days and maybe he paid the price here.\" </p> <p>Instead the most impressive 18-year-old on the pitch was Morrison. Middlesbrough played with courage and conviction, with McClaren displaying his tactical astuteness by deploying George Boateng just in front of his back four. Boateng's robust tackling was one of the reasons why Rooney, whose natural tendency is to drop deep, will ultimately regard his first Premiership match in United's colours as a chastening experience. Gareth Southgate and Chris Riggott were magnificent in the centre of defence and their raw but talented youngsters played as though devoid of trepidation. </p> <p>\"The important thing is that we did not come here to defend or to launch it up the pitch,\" said McClaren. \"To get a result here you have to defend manfully, score first and ride your luck, and we did all that. But, above all, we played some great football.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the most disappointing aspect for Ferguson was the length of time it took United to re-assert themselves after Morrison had hared down the touchline, evading Gabriel Heinze, and crossed for Downing to angle a left-foot shot beyond Carroll. United, starting sixth in the table, had begun the game confidently, with Ronaldo shimmering with menace, but failed to work up a head of steam again until the final 20 minutes when Smith was brought on for John O'Shea, whose transition from defence to central midfield has had only limited success. </p> <p>Middlesbrough played with such composure, indeed, that Roy Keane, having been booked for a challenge that necessitated Stuart Parnaby's early withdrawal, could have been sent off after taking out his frustration on a linesman. Rooney should also have been disciplined after scything down Boateng and a brief altercation late on with the Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. </p> <p>Ferguson, wearing one of his sternest expressions, bemoaned the number of opportunities that United squandered during the final exchanges, when it was their bad luck that the two best chances fell to a defender, Gary Neville. He could also reflect on a Van Nistelrooy header that looped on top of the crossbar and, in the first half, Parnaby's goal-line clearance to deny the same player. </p> <p>\"It was just one of those days, I'm afraid,\" grizzled the home manager, not for the first time this season. United cannot expect to catch Arsenal, or get anywhere close, as long as it remains one of those days . </p> <p><strong> Man of the match: </strong> George Boateng (Middlesbrough)</p> <p><strong>How Rooney fared</strong></p> <p><strong> 13min</strong> Heavily involved from the start, he instigates United's first incisive attack with a measured pass for Gary Neville to cross on the right. </p> <p><strong> 24</strong> First shot of the afternoon but he drags his effort well wide from 25 yards. </p> <p><strong> 31</strong> Off target again as he swings his left foot at Ruud van Nistelrooy's knock-down. </p> <p><strong> 40</strong> Fortunate not to be booked after hacking down George Boateng with a cynical challenge. </p> <p><strong> 68</strong> Tees up Cristiano Ronaldo for a shot but cannot convert the rebound from Mark Schwarzer's parry. </p> <p><strong> 74</strong> A perfectly weighted ball for Van Nistelrooy, who miscues his shot over the crossbar. </p> <p><strong> 78</strong> Another flash of petulance as United win a corner and he tries to grab the ball from Schwarzer.</p>",
  "The days of the tubthumping fiftysomethings are well and truly numbered. At the TUC's recent annual meeting, recruitment was once again a hot topic. But 21st-century trades union have now set their sights on a new breed of member to revitalise the ranks - the young, female office worker. <p>About 7.38 million people in UK employment are members of a trade union. But it was clear at Congress 2004 that the TUC is not happy with the figure. It claims that membership in decline, with only 36% of the workforce now protected by the powers of collective bargaining. Three out of five public sector workers belong to a union but the proportion drops to less than one in five among the private sector employees. \"Finding a new generation of recruits is a priority,\" says Paul Nowak, national organiser for the TUC. \"Because of that, we have had to rethink what we see as the average trade union member. Twenty years ago it would have been white guy in a manufacturing job that he would have for life. Now it's a different story.\"</p> <p>For the first time in (British) trade union history there is now a 50-50 split between male and female members. \"Part-time women workers are the fastest growing sector of all,\" says Nowak. \"In addition to this, we have to think about where they are working, often the new, unrepresented sectors such as the service industry and call centres. This change is now being reflected in the union's membership.\" </p> <p>The latest trade union membership survey, produced by the Department Trade and Industry, found that while the number of male union members fell by 48,000 in 2003, the number of female union members rose by 37,000. \"One size no longer fits all,\" says Nowak. \"These new members have different expectations from the modern workplace and we have to be responsive to that.\" </p> <p>The result of this shift in workplace demographics demands a rethink of traditional trade union activity. To recruit the young women that they need to survive, unions have had to revamp their image as well as their substance while still, of course, remaining fully committed to tackling the thorny issues of sex discrimination and pay disputes. </p> <p>The DTI survey showed that in 2003 the hourly earnings of union members were 17.7% higher than the earnings non-union employees. However, trades union increasingly find themselves tackling wider issues too. One union has been given the chance to go right back to the drawing board. The recently-formed Amicus via a merger of the AEEU and MSF unions) has seized the opportunity to brand itself with a bright new image. \"Both the MSF and the AEEU have brought their history and traditions with them but this is a chance to create a trade union that will attract a new audience,\" according to Sally Kosky, the union's head of organising. </p> <p>Amicus thought hard about what new members want from their friendly trade union. Their modernised brochure now includes a CD-rom and new recruits can sign up via the Amicus wesbite instead of filling in forms with a nicotine-stained rep. \"We get 20,000 hits and up to 60 new members a day on our website,\" says Kosky. \"Of course the union has to be organised enough to support this, but this is a way of getting new members through the door.</p> <p>We have also been campaigning for women by focusing on issues important to them,\" she adds. \"Women's aspirations are higher than they used to be. They expect to be treated fairly in the workplace. Family-friendly issues were first raised 20 years ago but workers weren't really sure that they had the right to make such demands. That has changed, though, and union campaigns reflect that. We've have to make the union relevant to women's needs and step up the way that those women perceive us.\" The make-up of the trade union organisations themselves is also changing. New members want to see people of the same gender, age or ethnicity as themselves within the union structure. </p> <p>Yvonne Caldwell is manager at a North Yorkshire branch of ShoeFayre as well as a union rep for USDAW. She is active within the union and an example of the type of member whom the TUC hopes can succeed in attracting a younger, female audience where the traditional donkey-jacketed brazier boys are likely to fail. \"I became active when I discovered that the company I worked for had poor holiday entitlement,\" explains Caldwell. </p> <p>\"That was when I set up the National Negotiation Committee which needed to be in place before talks could start. It took two years to achieve it and the negotiations were held in 2000.\" For Caldwell, being a member of USDAW meant more than campaigning for her individual rights. She also got the chance to develop personally and professionally. \"Being a member of a union can benefit your career. Since joining USDAW, I have done every course available to me from employment law through to working with the media. I have even gained NVQs. It's also made me a better person to work with because I know how employees should be treated in a healthy workplace.\" </p> <p>Caldwell's is a success story, but building up membership is a constant struggle. It's about more than handing out leaflets in the accounts department - unions need a constant presence that employees can relate to. Nigel Venes is national organiser at the private sector's union PCS. For him the recruitment issue is more urgent than ever. The major overhaul of the civil service, recently announced by chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, has led to the potential loss of 104,500 jobs across the UK. </p> <p>\"It gives recruitment a new meaning,\" says Venes. \"However, we are working hard to build up the membership figures. We are the first union to map our members which will show us what areas need extra support. For example, in the civil service alone there is potential for 150,000 new members.\"</p> <p>Research has also shown that most young members join because they are told about the union on their first day at work or because a colleague has spoken directly to them about the union. The result is that the PCS no longer sends recruiters into the workplace. Instead, it wants to create a trusted union presence that will further encourage young people to join. \"This is how we are going to change the current set-up,\" Venes explains. \"If a workplace is made up of 70% women, the union branch should also have 70% women. It's about having role models in the workplace too. We should also be using famous names to attract new members.</p> <p>\"Take someone like David Beckham. He's a member of the PFA, the footballer's union. Imagine what his endorsement of unions could do for membership figures.\" Such an endorsement could also remind many younger employees that unions do still exist. One of the biggest problems that trades union face in attracting younger women is the restrictions placed upon on the organisations by the government during the 1980s. It means that there are people entering the world of employment now who have never been aware of trade union activity. The result is that they don't sign up simply because they don't know that they can.</p> <p>The TUC's New Unionism campaign is already tackling this issue. The project doesn't just build up the numbers of young women within the ranks, it is also intent on entering those still un-unionised sectors of the economy in an effort to educate and reform. The result? In 2003 alone, 500 companies drew up new recognition agreements. \"We owe it to these people to tell them what trade unions are all about,\" says Venes. \"Unions are beneficial to their working lives and their professional development. They are also a chance to break down traditional barriers and create the workplaces that workers want for themselves.\"</p>",
  "<p>The variety of specialities in law is dizzying. There are departments devoted to everything from aviation to wills, via competition law, media law, banking, finance, environmental and planning law, shipping, real estate, tax, pensions and - in larger firms - a million smaller fields. How can anyone know where best to pitch their tent? </p> <p>Naturally, the pace and atmosphere of a department depends partly upon its size, the size of the firm to which it belongs and, of course, the individuals of which it is composed. But there are guidelines which can help you sort out the softer sheep from the hard-headed goats. Corporate, litigation and banking departments are generally considered to be among the most highly pressurised practice areas. \"You're working for fee earners who are probably being screamed at by their clients on a regular basis,\" says Sarah, a PA who works for the mergers and acquisitions team in a large London firm. \"Deadlines are tight and everyone knows that if you don't meet them, lots of people stand to lose lots of money. That doesn't make for a relaxing environment, but it's not a dull one either.\" </p> <p>One person's 'dull' is another person's 'reassuringly routine', however. Property, tax, estate planning, probate, intellectual property law - these are the departments which tend to be at the quieter end of the range and ideal for those who do not enjoy the unexpected. Maxine Hunt, a property secretary in a mid-tier firm says, \"It is always a busy department and I like to be busy and feel useful but not challenged with anything too unfamiliar. Plus you don't have to take your work home with you.\" </p> <p>It's important to choose somewhere that's not going to be totally at odds with your natural inclinations. People come from different backgrounds, have different priorities and different expectations of their jobs. \"Matching personality traits to the right kind of place is a very important part of our work,\" says Denis Simpson, one of the company directors of legal recruitment consultants Career Legal. \"If someone comes in wanting to work in city banking law, but we think they're the kind of person who would be eaten alive there, we'll try and guide them into other areas, somewhere less target-driven, less cut-and-thrust. Something like probate is staid, steady and better for them than a corporate department where deadlines are particularly tight and you can work late into the night, more like being on a trading floor than working for a law firm.\" </p> <p>Other people choose their field for the subject matter. \"I chose to work in employment since it's more \"real\" than, for instance, dealing with someone's lease or parcel of land,\" says Karen Morgan, who works at the same firm as Hunt. \"It's about issues to which I can relate and it is - in my opinion - much more interesting to be involved with topics such as sexual harassment, race discrimination, and disability discrimination which may, at any time, affect all of us. And you quite often have to deal with clients who are upset or angry too, and this can be challenging and rewarding.\" </p> <p>Or you could take a more oblique approach to a legal secretarial career. Helen Bennett used to work in the high-powered finance department at \"magic circle\" firm Clifford Chance. \"It was very demanding,\" she says. \"You're working with big documents, which are constantly being changed and have to be compared to previous drafts, you're using lots of precedents, and on big transactions with constant deadlines and pressure. There was a great need for teamwork and to understand that you had to be on the ball the whole time.\" Like all the big firms, Clifford Chance has an overtime rota and night-time support staff, but in a smaller firm working in such a department requires a great degree of flexibility. \"You'd pretty much have to stay 'til things were done,\" Bennett notes. \"It would be no good being an 'I'm off out the door' type of person.\" She now works as the PA to the Clifford Chance management group. \"It's still very pressurised,\" she says. \"But there's more admin and more opportunity to get involved, and not so much 'there and then' stuff. And it's very nice to have been able to see both ends of the spectrum rather than just move from practice area to practice area.\"</p>"
