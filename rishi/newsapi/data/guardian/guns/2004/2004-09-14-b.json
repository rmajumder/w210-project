[
  "<p><strong>Preamble</strong><br></p> <p>It's match-day one of 178 in this year's Champions League. Arsenal, as consistently bobbins in this competition as they are excellent in the Premiership, go into the tournament as co-favourites with Real Madrid. If they don't win this group comprised of Panathinaikos, PSV and Rosenborg at a canter without breaking sweat, they might as well throw their hats at the whole jamboree. </p> <p>Meanwhile, first whinge of the tournament goes to Simon Rake: \"It's 8:31 here in France and still nothing on the live commentary. Can I be the first (no doubt of many) this evening to accuse you of being crap.\" </p> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> PSV kick off, playing in white shirts with short black sleeves, black shorts and white socks. Arsenal play in their usual home strip. The referee is the same fellow who sent off three players, including Robbie Savage, in the World Cup qualifier between Northern Ireland and Wales. Domenico Messina we salute you. </p> <p> <strong>2 mins:</strong> For Arsenal, Robert Pires is operating down the right, with Jose Reyes taking up a position on the left flank. Dennis Bergkamp appears to be being man-marked by Mark van Bommel. Or Philip Cocu even. </p> <p> <strong>5 mins:</strong> No attacks of note to report yet, although Arsenal are enjoying the lion's share of possession early doors. Their back four have set up camp on the halfway line, from where operations are being directed. </p> <p> <strong>7 mins:</strong> Patrick Vieira wins the ball in midfield, surges forward and plays a lovely little ball into the path of Jose Reyes, who had darted into the box from the left. In the PSV goal, Edwin Zoetibier rushes off his line and clears up. </p> <p> <strong>9 mins:</strong> Henry picks up the ball on the left wing, cuts inside and tries his luck with a diagonal daisy-cutter from about 15 yards. It's deflected out for a corner, which Zoetibier claims comfortably. Far be it from me to tell Thierry Henry how to go about the business of scoring goals, but Jose Reyes had made another great run across the six-yard box and was hovering somewhere in the vicinity of the back post, screaming for a cross. </p> <p> <strong>12 mins:</strong> Jose Reyes makes a diagonal run into the box from the left wing, Thierry Henry pokes a brilliant pass into his path and the young Spaniard rifles the ball into the side-netting. </p> <p> <strong>14 mins:</strong> Martin Heward-Mills wants a big shout out. Quite why he should get one is anyone's guess - this isn't some cheesy radio request show. Having said that, I'm prepared to take pity on him as he's part of the - deep breath - Credit Derivatives Portfolio Review Team at Barclays Capital. I would hazard a guess that this is bound to be the highlight of his otherwise sorry life. </p> <p> <strong>17 mins:</strong> Guus Hiddink and PSV have set their stall out and it ain't too pretty. They've loaded the midfield in the hope of stifling Arsenal's creativity and are playing a lone frontman. After stringing about 15 passes together they finally muster their first shot on goal. Johann Vogel sends it wide as a ditch. </p> <p> <strong>21 mins:</strong> Thierry Henry tries to thread another pass into the path of a Jose Reyes gallop from the left wing. Alex cuts it out and clears. </p> <p> <strong>22 mins:</strong> Arsenal string a few passes together around the edge of the PSV box, before Gilberto plays an incisive ball through to Bergkamp, whose first touch is terrible. The ball bounces off of his shin and Wilfrid Bouma hacks clear. </p> <p> <strong>23 mins:</strong> Vieira wins the ball for Arsenal and feeds Reyes, who runs down the left wing before crossing towards Pires. Wilfrid Bouma heads clear for PSV. </p> <p> <strong>25 mins:</strong> Pascal Cygan ducks to let a long ball into the Arsenal box go wide, but Gerald Sibon nicks in behind him, picks it up and shoots. The ball was on the verge of going out of play, so the angle was rather narrow. From the goal-kick, the ball finds its way to Reyes on the left again. He crosses, but Robert Pires fails to get a toe to it. He should have scored. </p> <p> <strong>29 mins:</strong> Gilberto wins a free-kick for Arsenal after getting hacked down by PSV skipper Mark van Bommel, who rakes his studs down the mandolin-playing midfielder's calf. Thierry Henry gets plenty of welly on the ensuing free-kick from about 35 yards out and PSV goalkeeper Edwin Zoetebier gets his palms stung before catching it on the second attempt. </p> <p> <strong>34 mins:</strong> \"As an American following the match through your commentary (due to the appalling lack of US media interest), I am particular eager to hear about DaMarcus Beasley's performance. Can you mention him whenever he gets even close to the ball?\" writes Chuck Burgess. Here's the thing, <em>Chuck</em> - with a name like yours, there's really no need for you to point out that you're American. It's implied. </p> <p> <strong>36 mins:</strong> Arsenal win a corner, which Henry sends in to the far post. Patrick Vieira peels off his marker, Alex, but fails to direct his header towards either the goal or a team-mate. A PSV defender clears.</p> <p> <strong>38 mins</strong> On the left side of the PSV box, Thierry Henry tries a howitzer from distance which Edwin Zoetebier can only parry. Robert Pires follows up and heads it into to the goal from about 10 yards and wheels away to celebrate. The goal is incorrectly judged to have been offside. </p> <p> <strong>41 mins: Arsenal 1 - 0 PSV</strong> Brilliant work from Thierry Henry who, deep in PSV territory, chased an apparently lost cause to the sideline, won the ball, turned and dribbled in behind two defenders at breakneck speed. His low cross to the near post was turned in by either PSV defender Alex, under pressure from Patrick Vieira. </p> <p><strong>45 mins:</strong> \"What's the weather like? I like to get an idea about all the conditions in order to fire up my imagination,\" writes Keith Miller in Seattle. Tell you what Keith - why don't you just fire up your imagination by, er, imagining what the weather is like. </p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> </p> <p>\"Martin Heward-Mills should be terminated for using his corporation's e-mail for such a silly purpose as a shout out, unlike this e-mail which is very important,\" write Rob Wilbanks, who is Director of Development &amp; Communications at The National Policy and Advocacy Council on Homelessness in Washington DC.</p> <p> <strong>A box office queen writes:</strong> \"Good evening Barry, I do hope you are well,\" writes Alison Jeeves, who regular readers will know as the Box Office manager at London's Carling Apollo in Hammersmith. \"It is the Oxfam Make Trade Fair gig at Hammersmith this evening with a stellar line up including Razor light, Jamelia, REM and Minnie Driver. Not as exciting as watching Arsenal in the champions league of course.\" </p> <p>Here's a question? How can a line-up featuring Minnie Driver possibly be described as stellar? And how can you have a Make Trade Fair gig without Chris and Gwyneth present?</p> <p> <strong>46 mins:</strong> Arsenal get the second half underway and continue where they left off in the first, with one probing attack after another into the PSV half. On ITV1, co-commentator Andy Townsend says \"Jose Antonio Reyes keeps his shape down the left-hand side.\" Fancy that - a Jose Antonio Reyes-shaped Jose Antonio Reyes.</p> <p> <strong>50 mins:</strong> \"Could Keith Miller tell me what the weather's like in Seattle please?\" inquires Pete in Vancounver, BC. \"I'm going to watch the baseball tonight and would like to know if I need to take a coat.\"</p> <p> <strong>51 mins:</strong> Gilberto fires a long ball down the right wing, which Jose Reyes sprints across the field to latch on to. Edwin Zoetiber rushes off his line and narrowly beats the young Spaniard to it. </p> <p> <strong>52 mins:</strong> PSV are starting to enjoy a bit of possession now. They're good at holding on to it on the rare occasions they get it, but they're not looking at all threatening. </p> <p> <strong>54 mins:</strong> \"There are quite a few of us at Barclays Capital slaving away tonight instead of watching the match,\" writes Guy Abbi. \"It's favouritism to pick out the Credit Derivatives Team, what about a mention for us poor folks in Legal?\" </p> <p>It is done, you sad gits. I'd say your Christmas party is a real riot - electric-shock handbuzzers and photocopied backsides a-go-go. </p> <p>For Arsenal, Gilberto launches a sortie down the right channel and shoots, but his effort is deflected for a throw-in. </p> <p> <strong>57 mins:</strong> Good news for Chuck (34 mins): DaMarcus Beasley picks up the ball just inside the Arsenal half on the left wing, turns around and passes it five yards backwards. You'd think that, being an American, he'd be a bit more gung-ho when it comes invading somebody else's territory. </p> <p> <strong>58 mins:</strong> After making his first contribution of note in this match, DaMarcus Beasley is substituted. His replacement? Farfan of Peru. </p> <p> <strong>60 mins:</strong> Farfan has come on as a direct replacement for Beasley and takes up position on the left wing. Gerald Sibon, once of Sheffield Wednesday, is on his own up front for PSV and - like your commentator in a trendy London nightclub - is hardly getting a sniff. Arsenal attack down the right courtesy of Thierry Henry, but his low cross is too close to the goalkeeper. </p> <p> <strong>62 mins:</strong> Andre Ooijer clips a lovely ball into the Arsenal box from the right-hand side. Jens Lehmann doesn't know whether to come for it or not, opts to stay on his line and breathes a sigh of relief when both Sibon and Farfan fail to get a touch on it. A let-off for Arsenal. </p> <p> <strong>64 mins:</strong> Arsenal win a free-kick just outside the D on the edge of the PSV box. Thierry Henry fires it straight into the PSV wall. </p> <p> <strong>65 mins:</strong> After stopping that Thierry Henry pile-driver with his face, a dazed and confused Gerald Sibon has been replaced by every minute-by-minute commentator's nightmare: Jan Vennegor of Hesselink take a bow. </p> <p> <strong>67 mins:</strong> \"May I be the first to press for less detailed coverage of the football, and more scathing putdowns of hapless members of your far-flung audience,\" writes Dan McSweeney. \"I'm sure there are several places one can find straightforward accounts of what's happening on the field. But we are Guardian readers (or internationally-located ex-readers), and as such expect lots of humour and abuse in our football commentary.\"</p> <p> <strong>71 mins:</strong> \"Nice one about DaMarcus Beasley,\" writes Adrian Slobin. \"Of course, being a Brit, you would be one to wait for the Americans to invade first.\" I see what you've done there Adrian but I'm an Irishman and not a subject of the queen. </p> <p> <strong>72 mins:</strong> Dennis Bergkamp swings in a free-kick from the left, Gilberto flicks it goalwards and it fizzes narrowly wide. Patrick Vieira lunged in an attempt to steer the ball home, but to no avail. Arsenal are cruising, but not so much that they couldn't do with a second goal. PSV are much-improved in this second half.</p> <p> <strong>75 mins:</strong> After a melee in the Arsenal box, Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink rifles an effort narrowly wide. A real let-off for Arsenal. </p> <p><strong>77 mins:</strong> Arsenal substitution: Reyes off, Edu on. </p> <p> <strong>79 mins:</strong> \"Why's Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink got such a crap name,\" asks Stuart Coyle, who isn't really one to talk considering he shares his surname with a method of female contraception. </p> <p>The reason he has such a \"crap name\", Stuart, is because it's a mixture of the names of two different farming families in 17th century Holland. A member of the Vennegoor family married a member of the Hesselink family and so the surname Vennegoor of Hesselink was born. It's the equivalent of a double or treble-barrelled name that posh Brits have: Jonathan Wim-Bim-Biscuit-Barrel-Witherington-Tosspot-Haugh, or something like that. </p> <p><strong>83 mins:</strong> Dennis Bergkamp dinks a little ball into the box and Thierry Henry pounces. Unfortunately for Arsenal, he fails to control and gets the ball caught under his feet before conceding a free. </p> <p> <strong>85 mins:</strong> Johann Vogel clips a high ball to the edge of the Arsenal box, which Farfan heads straight up into the air. When it drops, he swivels and sends a tame volley towards Arsenal's goal, which doesn't trouble Lehmann. </p> <p> <strong>87 mins:</strong> Keith Miller in Seattle writes: \"In reply to Pete in Vancouver, the weather in Seattle is cloudy with occassional sun-breaks. However, the chance of rain will increase as the day goes on. Not to worry though as the ballpark has a retractable roof. It might get a bit chilly later though, so you should probably bring a coat.\"</p> <p> <strong>88 mins:</strong> Robert Pires goes on a surging run down the right wing, but is dispossessed by Andre Ooijer, who hacks clear. </p> <p> <strong>90+1 mins:</strong> Sorry, I was daydreaming there. PSV launch what I hope will be a last-ditch attack down the left as Patrick Vieira goes down injured, holding his ribs. He crawls to the sideline, while Park Ji-sung dispossesses Edu and shoots. Bish! Bosh! Bang! One PSV player after another peppers the Arsenal goal in search of an equaliser. </p> <p> <strong>Full-time</strong> Peep! Peep! Peep! The referee blows for full-time and Arsenal finish with three Champions League points more than they had at this time last season. Patrick Vieira is on his feet and smiling too, so he appears to be okay. That's your lot for tonight. Thanks for your time and your emails. </p> <p> <strong>Arsenal:</strong> 1-Jens Lehmann; 12-Lauren, 18-Pascal Cygan, 28-Kolo Toure, 3-Ashley Cole; 10-Dennis Bergkamp, 4-Patrick Vieira (capt), 19-Gilberto, 7-Robert Pires; 14-Thierry Henry, 9-Jose Antonio Reyes<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Almunia, Van Persie, Fabregas, Edu, Pennant, Clichy, Hoyte.</p> <p><strong>PSV Eindhoven:</strong> 21-Edwin Zoetebier; 2-Andre Ooijer, 4-Alex, 5-Wilfred Bouma, 3-Lee Young-Pyo; 7-Park Ji-sung, 6-Mark van Bommel (capt), 8-Philip Cocu, 11-DaMarcus Beasley; 14-Johann Vogel, 35-Gerald Sibon<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Gomes, Vennegoor of Hesselink, Lucius, Farfan, Lamey, Feher, De Jong.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Domenico Messina (Italy)</p>",
  "<p>Henrik Larsson admits he is uncertain how he will be received at Parkhead tonight but, if his welcome at the airport is anything to go by, it will be rapturous. The Swedish striker is making his first return to Glasgow since leaving for Barcelona after seven years with Celtic, where he scored 242 goals and became the fans' favourite. </p> <p>\"It's good to be back in Scotland, I feel great and I have never felt fitter,\" he said amid tumultuous scenes at Glasgow airport. He added: \"To be honest, I'm not sure how I will be received at Parkhead tomorrow night.\" </p> <p>But his former manager Martin O'Neill had no doubts. \"He will be afforded an excellent reception after what he did here and he should be applauded when he comes out on to the pitch. But I wouldn't like them to applaud him every time he touches the ball. The crowd have got to have a reality check and he is now playing for the opposition.\" </p> <p>The Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard agreed: \"I respect the opinion of the supporters here but he plays for Barcelona now and he will try to win this match for us.\" </p> <p>Larsson scored in Bar\u00e7a's 2-0 victory over Sevilla at the weekend and is almost certain to start, having quickly established himself in a team tipped for success this season. </p> <p>\"There were people down south that were saying that Henrik would only score goals in the SPL,\" said O'Neill, \"but he has scored in the Spanish league and for Sweden with monotonous regularity and people down south might have to write other things.\" </p> <p>A draw looks a good bet, as Celtic are unbeaten in 19 home European games while Bar\u00e7a are unbeaten in their last eight away Champions League matches. It is 40 years since the Catalans beat a Scottish side - Celtic in the Fairs Cup. </p> <p>Celtic, who put Bar\u00e7a out of last season's Uefa Cup, are likely to be without the striker Chris Sutton (hamstring). For Barcelona Gerard is expected to play in the centre of midfield in place of Thiago Motta, who faces six months out after rupturing knee ligaments.</p>",
  "<p>Beauty is proverbially in the eye of the beholder, yet Jose Mourinho's view is distorted by expectation. </p> <p>The requirement for silverware after four barren seasons at Chelsea has understandably caused the Portuguese to consider pragmatism his principal concern. The four clean sheets his side have kept this season are certainly admirable, yet Mourinho considers such a record to be worthy of higher esteem. </p> <p>\"It is important that a team is beautiful from a defensive point view,\" said Mourinho ahead of tonight's Champions League Group H encounter with Paris St-Germain. \"I can't see it being otherwise. It's about being compact and that can be beautiful. It's important to be strong defensively.\" </p> <p>Mourinho has scorned with reason English sides' defensive profligacy in Europe but it is in attack where Chelsea have yet to shine. The Blues have dropped only two points out of 15 in the Premiership but Arsenal have scored more than three times as many goals. </p> <p>\"We have played quality attacking football,\" said Mourinho. \"We scored two goals against Crystal Palace away, two at Stamford Bridge against Southampton. Our 0-0 against Aston Villa, normally we would expect to score goals there with attacking players of the quality we have.\" </p> <p>Mourinho's words refer to talents such as Didier Drogba, the \u00a325.4m striker who can expect a hostile reception from the Parisian crowd because of his Marseille associations. Yet such distractions should not deter a side so brimming with talent as Chelsea's. </p> <p>Paris have failed to win a single league game this season, lie 14th in the French league and the three points they have achieved all came courtesy of draws with newly promoted sides. Suspension to Mario Yepes, their most accomplished defender, compounds Parisian troubles. </p> <p>Only those considerations have persuaded Mourinho to alter the safety-first approach. \"If you start the group stage at home you have to win. Away, you have to get a point,\" said Mourinho, before adding a caveat. \"If we leave Paris with a point, normally it is good for the next stage. But that is not the way we are thinking. We come here to play with a victory in mind. We are not going to play a defensive game.\" </p> <p>None the less, the strategy that paid such unexpected dividends during Porto's run to triumph in the Champions League final last season will not be dropped. Mourinho insists that with this new beginning he \"wants to forget\" that achievement, though the lessons learned will be retained. </p> <p>With the Portuguese champions Mourinho put great store by the intelligence and flexibility of his players and it is a policy he has taken with him to Stamford Bridge. \"Sometimes in competitions where you play against different countries, cultures, mentalities one of the things that can help is the tactical culture,\" he said. </p> <p>\"You must know how to adapt when you are playing a Spanish side, an Italian side or a French side, you must think on the pitch. You can't play by instinct or by heart or by how the opponent likes you to play. Sometimes you have to be intelligent to control the game.\" </p> <p>Despite expecting his sides to control games, Mourinho's preference remains for defence. That natural cautiousness led to him refusing to attribute favouritism to his \u00a3200m talents. \"For me, in football there is no such thing as a favourite,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It is not about money, not the name of the players or the prestige of the club. This is the best competition in the world; more than the World Cup, more than the European Championship, because the level is superior.\" </p> <p>Mourinho recalled that his Champions League success with Porto had been built on the previous season's Uefa Cup victory. And there was a sign yesterday that he was looking to the long term with the news that he had personally selected the head of Reading's academy Brendan Rodgers to oversee Chelsea's youth development. </p> <p>The Ulsterman said: \"I've had a fantastic time at Reading but the opportunity to work with a European Cup-winning manager at a club like Chelsea was too good to turn down.\" </p> <p> <strong> Chelsea</strong> (4-1-2-1-2): Cech; Ferreira, Carvalho, Terry, Bridge; Makelele; Tiago, Lampard; Duff; Gudjohnsen, Drogba. </p> <p><strong> PSG</strong> (4-4-2): Letizi; Mendy, Fanfan, Helder, Armand; Corridon, Mbami, Ciss\u00e9, Rothen; Reinaldo, Pauleta. </p> <p><strong> Referee</strong> : M Gonz\u00e1lez (Sp).</p>",
  "<p>Mark Halsey has been rebuked by the manager of the referees' select group Keith Hackett for admitting that Arsenal players persuaded him to reverse his award of a penalty to Fulham on Saturday. </p> <p>Halsey will not be suspended because he broke no laws, unlike his colleague Andy D'Urso, suspended earlier this season for not sending off Blackburn's Barry Ferguson for two yellow cards. Halsey's call over Ashley Cole's tackle on Andy Cole during Arsenal's 3-0 win at Craven Cottage was right but in a way that called referees' authority into question. </p> <p>All this came after a weekend of controversy that yesterday saw the referee Rob Styles rescind a yellow card, shown to Chelsea's Didier Drogba for diving during the goalless draw with Aston Villa, after watching video replays of the incident. Halsey's performance will be analysed at the elite squad's next fortnightly get-together. </p> <p>Hackett said: \"The function of referees is to make decisions and not be influenced by players. It was the right decision. It's the process that I'm uneasy about.\" </p> <p>Although Hackett added that Halsey's about-turn was \"not based entirely on player reaction\", the referee himself told millions of television viewers that this had been the main factor. </p> <p>Halsey will be told in future to keep any post-match explanations to points of law. Had he not been so candid, Arsenal's second-half goals would have swept the controversy aside. In the event replays showed that Halsey was influenced by protests from the Arsenal players. </p> <p>He then consulted the assistant referee David Bryan who confirmed his doubts. Hackett wants to know why Bryan did not buzz the referee to alert him to the mistake. </p> <p>The controversy involving the Everton midfielder Tim Cahill's bizarre sending-off after his match-winning goal at Manchester City on Saturday may not be so easily resolved. </p> <p>It led to a row yesterday between Fifa, the FA and the refereeing body over whether Cahill's second yellow card, and the resulting red, is to be scrubbed. </p> <p>It is thought that both the FA and the referees opposed Fifa's clampdown on shirt-removing players. </p> <p>Referees are understood to have been told to \"manage\" this sort of celebration rather than show yellow. However, Steve Bennett, a Fifa referee, applied the instruction to the letter - only to be rebuked for it by the Fifa president Sepp Blatter. All parties are working to clarify the rule.</p>",
  "The government is set to bow to backbench pressure and back legislation tomorrow which would ban foxhunting before the start of 2006 season. <p>Ministers had originally intended to delay the implementation of the ban for two years, until well after the next general election. But following pressure from backbench Labour MPs, the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael, will now back an amendment bringing the ban forward by six months.</p> <p>If the government then follows up its threat to use the Parliament Act to force the bill through the House of Lords, then foxhunting will be banned by July 2006 - before the start of the hunting season - instead of by November that year.</p> <p>The amendment has been put forward by two long-term proponents of a ban, Labour MPs Michael Foster and Tony Banks, and Mr Michael's parliament private secretary, Peter Bradley.</p> <p>Mr Bradley told Guardian Unlimited that it would \"meet the concerns that colleagues have expressed that they don't want to see too long a delay in the ban\".</p> <p>\"But it will also allow people to express their view on hunting at the ballot box, as the ban would not come into effect before the last possible date of the general election.\"</p> <p>\"This will deprive those more extreme amongst the hunting fraternity of any excuse to try to highjack the next general election.\"</p> <p>The deal is likely to further infuriate supporters of hunting, who already believe the government is using the bill as a means to placate its discontented backbenchers.</p> <p>The pro-hunting Countryside Alliance is planning a demonstration in Parliament Square tomorrow to show its opposition to the government's plans.</p> <p>It's spokesman, Darren Hughes said today: \"A lot of people now think it is no longer about hunting. </p> <p>\"Tony Blair is using hunting to manage his backbenchers. Rural people are fed up with being used as a political football</p> <p>The demonstration could, however, prove fruitless if the government goes ahead with its plans to push the legislation through by the Parliament Act. </p> <p>If the Lords reject the bill by the time the current parliamentary session ends this month, the use of the act would mean the will of the Commons would prevail and the bill would automatically gain royal assent.</p>",
  "Estelle Morris will most likely be remembered as the woman who broke one of Westminster's most macho taboos - stepping down from office because she actually felt she wasn't good enough at her job. <p>Ironically, that unprecedented step in 2002 made her more popular than ever - and smoothed the way for Alan Milburn to quit the next year to spend more time with his family.</p> <p>Acknowledging her deficiencies, Ms Morris earned a groundswell of sympathy, as she self-effacingly admitted she was happier in her previous more junior role as schools minister, rather than running the whole sprawling Whitehall empire of the education department.</p> <p>At the time, she wrote to the prime minister - who had promoted her along with Tessa Jowell and Patricia Hewitt, despite some sexist backlash in the Sun and elsewhere - saying: \" I am less good at strategic management of a huge department and I am not good at dealing with the modern media.\"</p> <p>It was the sort of honesty that had made Mo Mowlam a star within the Labour party, and Ms Morris was subsequently warmly greeted by members at party conferences.</p> <p>And, within a year, she had returned to government as the arts minister, such was the prime minister's regard for her.</p> <p>Although teaching was Ms Morris' former profession - endearing her to many of the teaching unions - she came from a strongly political background, both her father and uncle having been Labour MPs.</p> <p>Before entering parliament herself in the great disappointment of the 1992 election - which Labour lost having apparently been neck and neck in the polls - she had been leader of the Labour group on Warwick council for seven years.</p> <p>Although she initially voted for Bryan Gould as a leadership candidate in the aftermath of Neil Kinnock's defeat, she cast her preference for the Tony Blair/John Prescott \"dream ticket\" and subsequently rose quickly through Labour's ranks, becoming a whip in 1994 and an education spokesman in 1995, drawing on her professional experience as a teacher. </p> <p>When Labour came to power in 1997, she entered the then Department for Education and Employment as an under-secretary. </p> <p>After the 2001 election, she became the first secretary of state for the new Department for Education and Skills. </p> <p>There she faced severe problems with the new A and AS Level exams led to her being under immense political pressure - which was exacerbated when literacy and numeracy standards failed to match targets on which she had staked her career. Finally she quit the government in October 2002 in dramatic late-night move which caught MPs and journalists alike unawares.</p>",
  "<p>The battle for control of the nascent music download market today stepped up a gear as internet giant Yahoo! announced that it had agreed to buy US music software company MusicMatch in an \u00a389m deal. </p> <p>The move will see the Californian dotcom bellwether taking on Apple's iTunes Music Store and Microsoft's recently announced digital music service. It plans to use MusicMatch's online store and jukebox software to augment its own internet radio service, Launch. </p> <p>Boosted by the popularity of Apple's iPod and online music stores such as the new, legitimate incarnation of Napster, sales of digital music are expected to grow sharply in the next two years. </p> <p>Yahoo! has to date pursued a policy of pushing its Launch service in the US and Europe.</p> <p>This provides listeners with interactive online radio stations tailored to their taste and accompanying music videos. </p> <p>The purchase of MusicMatch will give it a readymade download store with 700,000 tracks and music playing software to compete with Apple, Napster, Sony and the dozens of other online stores that have sprung up in the past 18 months. </p> <p>MusicMatch also recently launched a subscription service, allowing consumers to access its entire library of tracks for a monthly fee. </p> <p>Yahoo! chief executive Terry Semel said that the company was \"committed to being a major player in digital music\".</p> <p>\"This combination bolsters our strategy to capture the largest audience of consumers as they make the shift to digital music, and supports Yahoo's goal to give consumers the greatest choice, control and flexibility in how they interact with music,\" he added. </p> <p>The music company is the latest in a string of acquisitions by Yahoo! with which it has attempted to widen its appeal and boost revenues.</p> <p>In the past two years it has also bought recruitment site Hotjobs, search marketing company Overture, search technology company Inktomi and shopping comparison site Kelkoo in deals worth a total of more than \u00a32bn. </p> <p>After years of viewing the internet as a threat, record companies have recently become enthusiastic advocates of online sales as a means of boosting flagging sales figures.</p> <p>In an effort to further promote the medium, the first official download chart launched earlier this month as a precursor to including digital sales in the official top 40.</p> <p>Record labels are watching with interest to see whether consumers prefer Napster's mixture of subscription and permanent downloads, iTunes' straightforward download service or OD2's hybrid version. </p> <p>In the US, iTunes is the clear market leader with a market share of more than 70%, selling more than 100 million songs since it launched last year.

  "<p>The work and pensions secretary, Alan Johnson, today promised the unions a major role in developing the government's pensions policy and workers a greater say in the running of their pension funds.</p> <p>Giving his first speech since his appointment, Mr Johnson told the TUC conference he would amend the pensions bill, currently going through parliament, to include powers to ensure 50% of pension scheme trustees are member-nominated.</p> <p>He also tried to quell union fears that workers will be forced to work longer in life by promising that the government would not to raise the state pension age to 70.</p> <p>\"This government will not raise the state pension age,\" he said. \"This government will not force people to work to 70 years of age.\"</p> <p>\"Our approach is to give people greater flexibility to make decisions about when and how long to work.\"</p> <p>Mr Johnson's pledge on pension scheme trustees was welcomed by the TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, who described it as \"another victory for people at work\".</p> <p>Like the prime minister before him, however, the majority of Mr Johnson's address was free of new policy detail but packed with warm words about the importance of the government's relationship with the unions.</p> <p>He claimed he had insisted that his first speech as work and pensions secretary be to the TUC and frequently referred to his background as a trade unionist.</p> <p>As a former leader of the Communication Workers' Union, Mr Johnson is the first union leader to make it to the cabinet since the T&amp;G's Frank Cousins was appointed minister of technology by Harold Wilson in 1964. </p> <p>The majority of his speech praised the record of his predecessor, Andrew Smith - who resigned from the government amid reports that he was exasperated about briefings against him - in tackling \"pensioner policy\".</p> <p>The Tory leader, Michael Howard, meanwhile, unveiled plans today to prevent elderly people being forced to use up their savings or sell off property to pay for residential care.</p> <p>Under his plans to foster partnership between families, the government and the insurance industry, people who take out an insurance plan that meets the cost of three years' long-term care would be guaranteed free long-term care by government beyond that initial period, regardless of their assets. </p> <p>Speaking at his party's Older People's Summit in Westminster, Mr Howard said 40,000 people a year suffer the indignity of having to sell everything to pay for long-term care. </p> <p>Launching a discussion paper on long-term care, he said the proposed three-year partnership scheme would be fairer, more transparent and would provide a vital safety net. </p> <p>Mr Howard said: \"For many people, the last few years of their lives can be spent in residential care. </p> <p>\"Without proper planning, that can end up meaning that someone's entire life savings and property are used to pay for that care. Forty thousand people suffer this indignity every year,\" he added. </p> <p>\"The current system is unfair. It encourages people to run down their assets. It penalises people who have saved.\"</p> <p>While Mr Howard promised greater details about his plans shortly, the government is waiting for its pension commission, chaired by former CBI boss Adair Turner, to report next month. </p> <p>Today, Mr Johnson said that it was a part of the government's efforts to \"face up to the problems of many people not saving nearly enough for retirement\".</p> <p>Perhaps the most controversial issue it faces is compulsion. The unions believe that employers should be forced to provide employee pension schemes, while the CBI believes the emphasis should be on individual responsibility.</p> <p>The chancellor Gordon Brown, meanwhile, has pulled out of speaking the TUC general council dinner this evening, as he has to remain at the bedside of his elderly mother, who is seriously sick in hospital.</p> <p>The Labour party chairman, Ian McCartney, will instead address the union leaders.</p>",
  "<p>There are now more doctors on television than there are in the NHS. I don't mean the oleaginous real ones holding the early-morning thrush clinic on breakfast TV (been there, done that), but the fictional ones. Medical dramas have long reached saturation point, so doctors are spilling into crime. In a recent episode of Waking the Dead, one doctor slaughtered an entire family so he could get reinstated on the medical register (a bizarre tactic that fooled even the GMC). Post-Shipman, doctors are so often the bad guys that any idiot could spot the murderer in BBC1's Messiah after five minutes. And I dread to think what Hannibal Lecter has done for recruitment into psychiatry.</p> <p>Dr Lecter is a brilliant comic creation who wouldn't look out of place in Channel 4's much-lauded Green Wing. Indeed, hospital-based comedies now seem to be nudging dramas as the most popular way to spin healthcare. TLC, Scrubs, Doctors and Nurses and now Green Wing have ploughed different parts of the same furrow with varying results, but the attraction of medicine for comedy remains as constant as ever.</p> <p>Why? Comedy generally requires a degree of entrapment, and you can't get more hierarchical than the medical profession and the NHS. Whatever level you're on, you're likely to be out of control, and not able to do your job properly, but not able to give it up. A friend of mine who has sacrificed his life, marriage and a substantial portion of his liver for his work (coincidentally, as a liver specialist) said he felt like he was in a salmon trap. He had invested so much time and effort swimming upstream that he couldn't chuck it all in and turn around even if he had wanted to. </p> <p>The NHS is also an extraordinarily unhealthy place to work or be sick in. We damage 10% of the patients and staff each year, not least by the pressure of expectation. Idiot politicians promise to save the NHS in time for the next election; patients want gods and angels armed with miracle cures and the media is forever exposing us. Doctors have become like neutered magicians, with all our tricks explained. </p> <p>Doctors like to think that we rise above all this with a razor-sharp wit worthy of any TV comedy, but as anyone who has sat through a medical revue knows, medics are much funnier to laugh at, than with. Traditional medical humour (Back Passage to India, Flush Gordon, On Her Majesty's Secret Cervix) doesn't translate well to a public stage. But the lasting impression of anyone brave enough to stay until the end is the bizarre range of disordered personalities in the cast. </p> <p>This is where medicine really comes into its own as a source of comedy. Doctors were traditionally selected on academic ability alone - three grade A science A-levels and the communication skills of a dead skunk. As students, the first patient we met was a dead one (start as you mean to go on), whom we hacked into ever-decreasing pieces. And if we survived our undergraduate years with any sympathy intact, one year as a junior doctor was sure to beat it out of you. I'm not saying we are all psychopaths, but most of us have deep conflicts about how much we really enjoy the job and whether we like people quite as much as we're supposed to. As one consultant radiologist put it in the medical magazine Hospital Doctor: </p> <p>\"There are a substantial number of patients out there who are utterly execrable ... they are, in the main, at worst trivially unwell. They need no attention (apart from a good slapping) but insist on being seen. I can only imagine the horror of seeing a waiting room filled with these churls and ingrates all bleating louder than sheep, knowing that there is damn-all wrong with them . . . I have a mental image of revenge - turning to a most loathsome specimen, smiling thinly while declaring: 'You've got cancer, you bastard - die soon.'\"</p> <p>Such extreme views are a merciful rarity but hospitals remain the commonest situation for TV comedy, not just because of the inexhaustibility of the storylines, but because of the sheer range and peculiarity of the characters. This is what Green Wing has spotted. The hour flies by with very little story, but you don't mind when the characters are so memorable. You wouldn't want to meet them on the eve of your prostate surgery but believe me, they're out there.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Phil Hammond is a GP and writer who co-wrote the BBC1 comedy series Doctors and Nurses, broadcast earlier this year</p>",
  "<p>It should have been a breeze. Say the word \"snip\" and the mind instantly conjures up \"small\", \"neat\", \"quick\", \"bargain\" even. But when it came to my vasectomy - an operation commonly known as the snip - I got much more than I had bargained for.</p> <p>I'm now almost three months, a scrotal haematoma, an infection and three courses of antibiotics on from my \"safe, simple, five-minute procedure\", and my all-too tender testicles have yet to return to their pre-op state. </p> <p>I had heard only good things about the snip: a friend was on the footy pitch after five days; my dad - admittedly a Liverpool docker, rather than a keyboard-tapping softie like me - went straight to the pub and used Guinness for pain relief. It sounded straightforward and my wife and I agreed - with two boys, Conor aged two-and-a-half and Dominic aged one, that our fam ily was complete, and it was my turn to do a bit for family planning.</p> <p>I plumped for Marie Stopes in Reading. As it turned out, the remarkably efficient booking process - a \u00a350 deposit towards a \u00a3295 fee guaranteed an appointment within a couple of weeks - was in stark contrast to the availability of aftercare. Marie Stopes prides itself on the use of the much-vaunted \"no stitches and no scalpel\" procedure, which sounded appealing. </p> <p>Blade-free it was; pain-free it was not. The local anaesthetic jabs - one for each testicle - felt as if the needle was nailing my scrotum to the bed. The tugging at the testicles to manoeuvre the site of the cauterised incision to allow the all-important vas deferens, the sperm-carrying tubes, to be sealed was all too new an experience for me. I also broke new ground by managing to explain to the doctor the nuances of the Wayne Rooney contract situation with my mouth contorted wide open while holding my breath for a full five minutes. </p> <p>Twenty minutes later, appeased by a brew and a mini packet of custard creams, my wife escorted me out of the clinic clutching a bag of post-op paraphernalia, with the good wishes of the friendly staff ringing in my ears. </p> <p>The real pain was about to begin. </p> <p>Thirteen hours later I was in an NHS bed having my bloody and swollen scrotum stitched. I didn't know it at the time, but I had gained a place in the exclusive club of 0.2% of Marie Stopes patients who suffer a haematoma - bleeding/swelling caused by a blood clot - brought on by a nicked blood vessel. Out of the 4,500 or so they perform each year in the UK, that is a grand total of nine unlucky men. The haematoma rate for the scalpel method is about 2%, according to the clinic. </p> <p>The bleeding began about an hour after returning home. I called the clinic and was told the doctor was on a train. Go to A&amp;E, they said. I called an ambulance and off I went. During the next 12 hours many of the doctors and nurses I saw seemed intrigued at how it had happened and why no stitches had been used. </p> <p>No fewer than 13 nurses and doctors examined me carefully. In a bloody but non-violent coup at Reading's Royal Berkshire Hospital, a wholesale nationalisation took place; my privates became very much public property overnight. The decision to stitch came at 1am. Three more of my favourite local anaesthetic jabs in the scrotum, and a handful of stitches stopped the bleeding and saved me from a trip to theatre to have the clot evacuated and the vessel stitched. </p> <p>I got home at noon the next day to discover that Marie Stopes had called to check how I was. I took to my bed with a bag full of painkillers and a packet of frozen peas for the swelling. A week later I was given a precautionary course of antibiotics by my GP to ward off infection. </p> <p>Driven by shock and dismay at how pear-shaped (and avocado-coloured) things had gone, I arranged to see someone at Marie Stopes. I was seen promptly by a doctor who kindly explained what had gone wrong and said the recovery could take months, mainly because the incision, rather than the vessel itself, had been stitched by the hospital, leaving a substantial blood clot inside. </p> <p>This was interesting for me. The clinic which performed the intitial operation was quick to criticise the action taken by the NHS, despite it not having the wherewithal to offer an alternative treatment when needed. It is a theme Marie Stopes has stuck to. Dr Timothy Black, chief executive at Marie Stopes UK, said: \"We would have applied pressure in your case, and if it [the bleeding] didn't stop we would have treated the vessel rather than stitching outside and leaving you with a blood clot. </p> <p>\"Stitching the scrotum is a completely reasonable approach for the NHS. Obviously, in an ideal world we should have treated you but there are times when a doctor is not available. It is not a 24-hour service.\" </p> <p>Marie Stopes was right about the recovery period: it was a fortnight before I could think about walking; two weeks later the much-anticipated infection came. Now, nearly three months on, the pain and swelling are minimal, and where the hole once was I finally have a scar. The practical problems were as great as they were unexpected: how exactly should you go about telling your kids that your crotch is no longer available for hire as a climbing frame-cum-trampoline? As for cuddles, stories on laps, and nappy-changing: no chance. </p> <p>And the impact on our work lives was considerable. My wife, Emily, and I both took two weeks off sick; me to recover and her to look after me and the kids. How exactly do you explain to your boss that after two years of acting as a conduit for the transfer of innumerable viruses from the nursery to the office, you are now having yet more time off sick? </p> <p>Maybe Napoleon had a point after all; until a new bill was introduced in 2001, vasectomies were forbidden in France under a 200-year-old \"anti-mutilation\" law. Snip-happy Britain, on the other hand, is top of the vasectomy league, according to the UN - 16% of men of reproductive age have had the op, a 1994 study found. According to research by Marie Stopes - which carries out 13% of all snips in the UK each year - somewhere between 80 and 800 of the 40,000 each year will result in a haematoma. </p> <p>Steve Foley, consultant urologist at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, where I was treated, says they deal with four or five cases a year. \"It is sold as a simple procedure in many private clinics, but we warn all NHS patients that there is a 5% chance of significant bruising or bleeding,\" he said. The scenario of private patients finding their post-operative problems treated by the NHS was also nothing new for him: \"It's a taste of what the future will hold with the trend towards privatisation.\" </p> <p>Despite the rollercoaster of the past three months, I am hopeful that the pain will not have been in vain and the op has worked (the failure rate at Marie Stopes is between 0.5 and 1%). And if, during my darker moments I feel at a loss for perspective, I can always recall the sentiments of my wife, uttered once she felt it was time for me to pull myself together, start changing nappies again and stop behaving like a man where pain is concerned. </p> <p>\"Just think,\" she implored, \"if the cut were 10 times bigger, and you'd had clothes pegs on your nipples and no sleep for the past month, then you'd be getting closer to knowing what giving birth is like.\"</p> <p>Obviously I haven't told her, but I think she had a point.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Dougray Scott</strong> could be the new James Bond, according to the Sunday Mirror. An anonymous source told the tabloid that the Scottish actor, who starred in Mission Impossible 2 and Enigma, was apparently the top choice to become 007 - after Eric Bana, Clive Owen, and seemingly every dark-haired non-American actor, were also considered. </p> <p>\"Bosses believe Dougray will be the perfect Bond,\" says the source. \"Producers have been eager to take [the character] back to the brooding and sexy figure that Sean was so brilliant at.\" Given where the story is coming from, you can make up your own mind about whether it's true or not. </p> <p><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong> is not bitter. After her co-star in Birth, Lauren Bacall, dismissed her in Venice as a \"beginner\", the Australian actor said she was actually grateful for the outburst: \"I was thrilled that she dismissed the legend stuff,\" Kidman told the Sun. \"To put me into a category I don't belong to burdens me with responsibility I don't want. I telephoned Lauren and thanked her for saying that. She always calls it like it is and that's a reality check I adore.\"</p>",
  "<p>Parents today launched a campaign to make schools legally responsible for eliminating bullying.</p> <p>The parents' campaigning group Action on Rights for Children (Arch) said government guidelines did not go far enough in stamping out the \"Lord of the Flies\" culture in schools.</p> <p>All schools are required to have an anti-bullying charter and have been sent new guidance informing them they are now legally responsible for children's welfare. </p> <p>But this week, Hilton Dawson, Labour MP for Lancaster and Wyre, will table an amendment to the children bill - drafted by Arch - that would make schools and local authorities compelled by law to prevent bullying. The bill is designed to give children more protection against abuse through education, health and social services. </p> <p>Terri Dowty, of Arch, a group of 200 families that campaigns for children rights, said: \"Some children are absolutely desperate: their lives are being destroyed by bullying. Families have been driven out of the education system altogether in record numbers - some have to leave their homes. Every week we hear more horrifying stories, or yet another child commits suicide. It is a national scandal.</p> <p>\"We need urgent action to change this 'Lord of the Flies' culture completely. Schools must become places where bullying can't happen because everyone takes responsibility for stopping it. Some schools are doing a fantastic job of eliminating bullying, but it takes real commitment and effort. Simply punishing and excluding won't do - problem schools need to take a serious look at the whole ethos of their school.\"</p> <p>This week, schools received guidance informing them they had an \"active duty of care\" to ensure children's welfare, but Ms Dowty said that was \"too vague a power\", and they should explicitly be responsible for ensuring there was no bullying in a school. </p> <p>The action group said schools should face inspections for children's well-being, based along the lines of those conducted by Ofsted. \"A school should be labelled 'failing' when it fails to keep children safe, and if the school can't sort itself out, a team of experts should be sent in to do the job for them,\" said Ms Dowty. \"The same priority must be given to bullying as to poor academic standards.\"</p> <p>No figures are kept on the effects of bullying, but last month the children's helpline Childline reported a 50% increase in calls about bullying in the past year. </p> <p>TV personality and founder of Childline Esther Rantzen has been critical of schools and local authorities for failing to implement their anti-bullying charters.</p>",
  "After weeks of bracing by the Bush White House, the category 5 storm has hit: Hurricane Kitty. Bestselling author Kitty Kelley's withering portrait of the Bush dynasty, The Family, is landing in bookstores on Tuesday - more than 720,000 copies of it. And the White House is already on high alert. \"This book is fiction and deserves to be treated as such,\" snarled Republican spokeswoman Christine Iverson, as the RNC fired off an anti-Kelley talking-points memo to friendly media assets. <p>The media blowback against Kelley, author of controversial biographies of Nancy Reagan and Frank Sinatra, has already begun. On the Monday morning Today Show, host Matt Lauer showed how tough an interviewer he can be when not questioning presidents and other potentates, pressing Kelley on who she's going to vote for in November (\"Who're you voting for?\" Kelley shot back) and the timing of the book's publication, weeks before the November election (\"Why not? It's relevant,\" countered the author, who's been working on the book for four years). </p> <p>The hottest dispute sparked by the book involves the allegation that George W Bush, who claimed to be clean and sober at the time, snorted cocaine with one of his brothers at the Camp David presidential retreat when his father was president. One of Kelley's sources - and the only one on the record - was Sharon Bush, the deeply aggrieved ex-wife of W's younger brother Neil. She is now in strong denial mode, even though her own publicist, who was present at a lunch where she told Kelley the story, confirms the accuracy of Kelley's account. Nonetheless, Lauer produced the Bush divorcee after his interview with Kelley to repeat her denials. </p> <p>While the Camp David coke party is getting the headlines, Kelley's book is filled with many other tawdry stories about the Bush dynasty. Here is a family that looks \"like The Donna Reed Show, and then you see it's The Sopranos\", Kelley tells Salon. </p> <p>As Kelley tells it, the dynasty had respectable origins - in the form of family patriarch Prescott Bush, the distinguished, moderate Republican senator from Connecticut - but rapidly slid into cynical opportunism, skulduggery, and a mean-spirited sense of entitlement. The first President Bush is presented as a weak yes man, driven not by political vision but a savage preppy spirit of competition instilled in him by his whirlwind of a mother. But it is his wife, Barbara (whom the ex-wife of White House counsel C Boyden Gray calls \"bull-dyke tough\"), and their eldest son, George, who are the true pieces of work in Kelley's book, a mother and son team brimming with such spite and ambition they would give the ruthless duo in The Manchurian Candidate the shivers. </p> <p>In one of the creepier passages of the book, a family gathering from hell at Kennebunkport, Maine, Barbara is shown mercilessly baiting her dry-drunk son, then governor of Texas, as a teetotalling 'Chosen One', while he keeps pleading to skip the cocktails and put on the feed bag, and his elderly father \"drools over [TV newswoman] Paula Zahn's legs\". </p> <p>One of the major themes in Kelley's book is the family's weakness for liquor and drugs. Alcoholism, she writes, runs deeply in the family and among its victims, according to one Bush family friend, was Prescott, a \"major-league alcoholic\", who was in the habit of checking himself into his men's club and country club to go on benders. And Kelley writes that George W Bush is not the only one in the first family who enjoyed illegal substances. While a student at Southern Methodist University in the 1960s, first lady Laura Bush was known \"as a go-to girl for dime bags of marijuana\".</p> <p>But, as one of W's Yalie frat brothers tells Kelley, it's not the substance abuse in Bush's past that's disturbing, it's the \"lack of substance ... Georgie, as we called him, had absolutely no intellectual curiosity about anything. He wasn't interested in ideas or in books or causes. He didn't travel; he didn't read the newspapers; he didn't watch the news; he didn't even go to the movies. How anyone got out of Yale without developing some interest in the world besides booze and sports stuns me.\" New Yorker writer Brendan Gill recalls roaming the Kennebunkport compound one night while staying there looking for a book to read - the only title he could find was The Fart Book.</p> <p>According to Kelley, the Bushes aggressively maintain their all-American family image by scrubbing government files of embarrassing facts, stonewalling journalists, and terrorising critics. \"Some people felt that George's past did not seep out and embarrass him and his family,\" she writes of the White House's current Bush, \"because he was protected by a coterie of former CIA men with an allegiance to his father.\" An Austin, Texas political consultant named Peck Young told Kelley that when a woman claiming to have been a call girl from Midland showed up in Austin with \"intimate knowledge\" of W during his oil wildcatting days, she was approached by what she described as \"intelligence types\" and left town abruptly. According to Young, the men \"made her realise that it was better to turn tricks in Midland than to stop breathing\". </p> <p>George HW Bush and wife Barbara dismissed Bill Clinton as a pathetic hillbilly when he challenged the incumbent in 1992. But, Kelley writes, Clinton was one of the few Bush opponents who knew how to back them down. As colourful stories from Clinton's sexual past in Arkansas began to surface during the campaign, a Clinton aide began digging into the senior Bush's own robust adultery. This included, writes Kelley, two long affairs.</p> <p>The Clinton aide told Kelley: \"I took my list of Bush women to his campaign operatives. I said I knew we were vulnerable on women, but I wanted to make damn sure they knew they were vulnerable too.\" After the eruption over Clinton's mistress Gennifer Flowers died down, sexual infidelity did in fact become a moot issue in the campaign. </p> <p>While Kelley is being savagely attacked as a tabloid sleaze queen, her book is more heavily researched and documented than Bush advocates allege. On occasion, she relies on sources that are less than reliable - inserting the story Hustler publisher Larry Flynt tried to put in media play about a girlfriend's abortion that W allegedly paid for before it was legal. Kelley says she decided to put the story in her book after interviewing the two investigators Flynt had hired to track down the story. But despite her flaws, Kelley has vigorously pursued leads about the powerful American dynasty - from Bush senior's shady CIA past to W's missing National Guard records - that the rest of the media should have. </p> <p>Salon spoke with Kelley on Monday afternoon at the midtown New York offices of Doubleday, her book publisher. </p> <p>[Salon:] The Bush forces are coming after you very strongly. And now the media is too. <br> [Kitty Kelley:] Yes, they are, this is what they do, this is how they operate. It's interesting, from talking with the media today, the European media is much less intimidated than the American press. The Americans are all saying, \"well, why should we listen to you. Look at the books you've written.\" Well, excuse me, those books have stood up, I stand behind everything in those books, they've stood the test of time. And this book will too. So I see how this media spin is working, and I'm not surprised. You'd think the media would look at my book and follow up on it - all right, she says here they instituted drug testing in the National Guard at such and such time, let's call up and find out if that's true. But don't beat me up just because I've come to you with almost a thousand sources. You know, I've gone through four sets of lawyers, because I'm dealing with a sitting president. </p> <p>[S:] You've gone through this before, of course, when Frank Sinatra tried to block publication of your unauthorised biography of him. How would you compare the heat you felt from Sinatra and his crowd and what you're going through now? <br>[KK:] It's worse now, because there's more at stake. With Sinatra, you just worried about getting the bejabbers beat out of you. But with the Bushes, they work on all sorts of levels to destroy the messenger so the message can't come through. But the message is the message. The stuff I've done is solid. Did I get everything? No. And you know something, we better hurry and try to get all the information we can get - because this president is trying to lock it all up through executive order, which means you won't be able to get presidential history, because the files and everything will be locked up. </p> <p>[S:] You write that the Bushes are particularly good at cleansing anything in government files that will besmirch the family reputation. How does that work? <br> [KK:] Well, you see it on all sorts of levels, from the trivial on up. For instance, I got a copy of the Bush family tree from the Bush presidential library. And at first we just thought a couple things were left off, but it was a number of things. Mentally retarded children from one branch of the family erased. Too many divorces in one family - that doesn't fit with the family-values image, so some ex-wives simply disappear. You could say that's just an oversight or mistake here and there. But when you see a pattern as I've seen over the past years of files redacted, too many mysterious fires that destroy records, state department files simply missing, gone, National Guard files. </p> <p>[S:]You also allege that the Bushes have tried to block people from talking with you and put pressure on your publisher. <br> [KK:] Yes, imagine the former president of the United States calling your publisher. I wrote George Herbert Walker Bush requesting an interview. He always responds to letters; he's famous for it. He even responded to Bob Woodward for a book. But he didn't respond to mine - he had an assistant phone the publisher of Doubleday, Steve Rubin. Imagine that pressure. All of a sudden, your publisher is told that not only does the former president of the United States not want this book to be written, he's not going to talk, he's not going to verify anything. Most publishers would have caved at that point. And I think Bush thought it would work. </p> <p>[S:] Let's talk about Sharon Bush - she is your only on-the-record source for the Camp David cocaine story. But she's now gone public denying she ever told it to you. Why would she do that? <br>[KK:] I don't know; my guess is she's scared. She talked about everything with me that day, mostly about the breakup of her marriage, and how the Bushes don't have family values. And she said to me that the affair that Neil had that broke up her marriage was aided and abetted by his parents, Barbara and George. </p> <p>She was crying and crying and she said, \"they let him have an affair. And I called up Barbara and threw myself on her mercy and said please, please tell him to come back home.\" And I said: \"How can his mother tell him to come back to his wife?\" And she said, \"you don't understand - they'll do anything she tells them.\" But she said her mother-in-law wouldn't do that, she was cold as ice. And she cried, \"you'd think Barbara would have been more sympathetic to me, considering all the infidelities she's had to put up with.\" </p> <p>Now over that lunch Sharon and Lou told me that she was in the midst of an alimony battle, she was angry that she was only being paid $1,000 (\u00a3557) a month alimony. And they told me they thought that if they leaked the fact she was having lunch with Kitty Kelley to the press, the Bushes hate you so much, that will scare them. And it might be leverage for her in her divorce. And Lou said: \"Well, this lunch might find its way into the New York Observer.\" And in fact it came out in the Observer the next week.</p> <p>[S:] So Sharon Bush was using you to put some heat on the family to get a better divorce deal? <br>[KK:] Yes. And I understand that. And she did get a better deal. Her alimony went up to $2,500 (\u00a31,400). So that told me something else about the Bushes and how they operate. So she got a better alimony deal out of it. But then she goes on The Today Show Monday morning to say you're wrong. That takes nerve, to go on network TV to challenge a bestselling author. </p> <p>[S:] Why would she have done that? <br>[KK:] Her kids. Her kids are in touch with her grandparents and they go, \"mom, how could you, how could you?\" I think it was pressure from her kids, coming down hard from her grandparents. Absolutely. She has three kids - one who's still a minor, Ashley, one, Pierce, who just started Georgetown University and wants to be a politician, and then she's got the model, Lauren. And I think kids are the first casualty, and they didn't ask for this and just want it all to go away. They probably love their family and are just appalled at what their mother did. And Sharon was probably at a very vulnerable time, and is not quite as vulnerable now. But she got on nationwide television and denied what she said, and I have a witness. </p> <p>[S:] Why didn't you tape it? <br>[KK:] It was in a restaurant, I never tape in them. It's loud and clattery. Also I knew it would probably be a sensitive interview. I don't tape every interview, but I have a lot on tape. </p> <p>[S:] In another explosive part of your book, you tell the story of a Midland prostitute peddling embarrassing stories about George W Bush who's suddenly run out of Austin by some threatening \"intelligence types\". You name one source for that story. Do you have others? <br>[KK:] One on record, and two unnamed sources. <br>[S:] Why didn't you name them? <br>[KK:] I don't remember why in that case.<br>[S:] With a charge like that, it seems like you'd want more than one named source. I'd also want to know if the source you named, this political consultant in Austin named Peck Young, had an axe to grind, if he was a Bush hater. What made you give that story credit?<br> [KK:] Because he was impeccable, that source, I feel very comfortable with him.<br> [S:] And you believe the Bushes are capable of doing something like that - of threatening a woman who is shooting her mouth off like that? You think the family really operates that way?<br>[KK:] I know the family operates that way. I wish you could see the stuff that's on the cutting room floor, that got left out of the book. There are other people who will tell you stories like that, but they won't go on the record. And you can't blame them. And I don't know how to convince them, that it's history, that it's important. Because I can't in good conscience tell them that. But I do feel comfortable with that story. I'm surprised by the number of people who did go on the record. </p> <p>[S:] Another inflammatory passage in the book is about the girlfriend whose abortion George W Bush allegedly paid for as a young man. There again it seems like you go with one source, and it's somebody many people don't find credible - Larry Flynt. <br>[KK:] Not just him - I relied on his two detectives.<br>[S:] So you went and interviewed them as well?<br>[KK:] Yes.<br>[S:] Again, I'm trying to figure out your methodology and why your enemies come after you and say: \"She relies on shaky sources or she'll lump a variety of sources together, no matter how they vary in credibility.\"<br> [KK:] Yes, I've read that one too.<br>[S:] So how do you respond to that - say on this one in particular, this abortion story?<br>[KK:] Well, I took the public record a little further and went to the investigators and asked for their stuff, and got their stuff. I have the woman's name, address and phone number ... <br>[S:] Did you make an effort to reach her?<br>[KK:] Of course. <br>[S:] And she wouldn't talk? <br>[KK:] No. <br>[S:] But you found the two investigators credible after talking to them? <br>[KK:] Yeah, I did. </p> <p>[S:] So your method is to leave it to the reader to make up their minds? <br> [KK:] Right. And to tell you how far I went. <br> [S:] That falls short of the standards of the New York Times, say, or the Washington Post. Why do you feel it's legitimate to fall short of that standard? <br> [KK:] I don't think that falls short of the standards of the New York Times or the Washington Post in every single instance. I think that especially the Washington Post has pushed things in the past, far beyond where I would go.<br> [S:] What's an example of that? <br> [KK:] Janet Cooke. <br>[S:] Well, that was exposed as a work of fiction! <br> [KK:] Jayson Blair ... <br>[S:] But the Times and the Post were both humiliated by those scandals. <br>[KK:] And I would be too if you find something in my books that didn't stand the test of time. I honestly would. <br>[S:]So you wouldn't have put a story like that in unless you'd done enough work on your own to satisfy yourself that there was something there, that it would hold up? <br> [KK:] Right. </p> <p>[S:] What do you think W will do if he loses in November? Will he happily go back to baseball? <br> [KK:] No. You know something that I have found out from this family after four years - he doesn't plan to lose. They know how to win - no matter what. <br> [S:] What does that mean?<br> [KK:] That means these people can put the Sopranos to shame.<br>[S:] Does that mean vote stealing? <br> [KK:] That's a bit overt. But nothing will stand in the way of these people winning. Nothing. You start out looking at the Bush family like it's The Donna Reed Show and then you see it's The Sopranos. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Talbot is Salon's founder and editor in chief</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited.<br> \u00a9 Salon.com 2004 <br> Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://salon.com\"> salon.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The education secretary, Charles Clarke, will today face a hostile Trades Union Congress conference following a motion to oppose the government's major policies on school reform in the run up to the next general election. </p> <p>Representatives from all major unions are likely to back a motion by the National Union of Teachers, which opposes the government's plans to scrap the comprehensive system of education and introduce a new breed of schools that will give parents more choice over their children's education. </p> <p>Last year the congress clashed with the government at its annual conference over plans to introduce variable university fees. This year in Brighton the point of conflict is the five-year plan, which proposes to diversify state education. </p> <p>All schools will have the chance to become \"independent specialists\", which will have greater freedoms from local authorities and government if they do well and hit targets. Specialist schools have a capacity to select some students and headteachers will be given greater powers to decide the future direction of the school. Controversially for the unions, they will also be allowed to set their own rates of pay.</p> <p>Some 200 academies will be introduced to replace failing schools - partly paid for by sponsors, who will take control of the school.</p> <p>The NUT motion deplores the \"expansion of academies, private sector involvement and faith schools\" and rejects the proposals to reduce the role of local education authorities.</p> <p>The motion continues: \"Congress expresses deep concern about the potential for increased selection by ability or aptitude arising from the government's emphasis on 'choice and diversity'.\" Further concerns centre on plans to localise pay deals and let individual schools set their own rates outside of the national pay scheme. </p> <p>The TUC is likely to back the motion this afternoon, which will mean a major new campaign on the issue. Members are also expected to debate issues on child protection, working conditions for teachers and whether the school testing regime is over stretching children. </p> <p>The education secretary is expected to address members directly after the education debate.</p>",
  "<p>Professor Schwartz's report has been eagerly anticipated within the admissions community. It's a thorough examination of the issues and decisions admissions face. Useful suggestions for implementation have been made, and the report has wisely fallen short of dictating to institutions what they should do, and how they should organise their admissions. </p> <p>The test however will be in the implementation. If all these recommendations are taken on board by the many bodies that will require organisational and procedural change, the bill for those changes will be vast, and if it does not happen properly then any new system may be perceived to be just as unfair as the current one. </p> <p>I believe that the question that needs to be asked, is: if all these changes are made, will the added value of these changes be sufficient to warrant the expense?</p> <p>The current admissions system has been dogged by perceptions of unfairness, and the feeling that getting into university is a mysterious process. Politicians and head teachers have gone to the press to complain that decisions on exceptional students have been 'unfair'. Critics say that its unfairness lies in the need for a deep understanding of the system and its tactics to ensure entry to the university of choice. </p> <p>To an extent that is fair criticism. The current system requires a strategic approach, and inevitably, it is more likely that applicants with interested parents, and good quality advice and guidance are more likely to play the system. Ironically, but perhaps not surprisingly, many of the public complaints have been from those very schools and families that are well prepared to work the system to their best advantage. </p> <p>The reality is that it has also been a very successful system that has served applicants and universities well over the past 40 years. The report and others before have endorsed the fairness of the current process, and the superb higher education completion rate in the UK compared with that of other countries is surely evidence that the current system has worked. </p> <p>Despite that, there is wide agreement that things have to change, and I agree: a far more diverse population is now entering higher education, and it is vital that everyone is given the opportunity to find the right course at the right university for them. </p> <p>Gaining a place at university is high-stakes - careers, life chances, earning capabilities - can all be greatly affected by the university and course attended. We need to ensure that access to higher education truly is available to all with the potential to succeed, and that admissions decisions can be seen to be fair. </p> <p>Changes to the admissions process will not make any difference to the competitive climate of universities. It will not manufacture additional places, in medicine, or physiotherapy or law. In the next few years the competition between universities will rise not lessen, and 2006 is only one admissions cycle away. </p> <p>Demand will still outstrip supply for some programmes, and the pressure might get worse. There will be applicant and university winners and losers, as now. We will still have press reports about disappointed three 'A' grade applicants unable to get into their preferred course or university. </p> <p>Requiring universities to detail their academic and non-academic admissions requirements is absolutely right. Ensuring that all applicants have equal access to high quality advice and guidance services is a greater challenge. </p> <p>Additional testing to differentiate between applicants, and to identify potential will be welcomed by some, but should only be used where absolutely necessary, and the tests need to be tested themselves to ensure that they are fit for the purpose.</p> <p>Training of admissions staff in universities is again vital and many universities already spend a great deal of time and resource on this, but many others do not. Ensuring access, and take up of training events amongst university staff will be a huge challenge.</p> <p>Electronic changes are inevitable and will definitely allow the process to speed up, but will it speed it up enough to allow the holy grail of 'PQA' - post-qualification admissions? </p> <p>I have not found anyone who disagrees that, in principle, it would be better if admissions decisions were made on actual, not predicted results. I am yet to be convinced that it is achievable within the UK education system, and that any system which emerges will be fairer for the applicant. Structural changes could just be too expensive, and the safeguards in the current system for applicants and institutions could potentially be lost. </p> <p>These proposals are about providing optimum life-chances for those who wish to benefit from higher education, and preserving the integrity of the UK's higher education system. If the resources can be made available to make the recommendations work, and the system truly makes the admissions process a fairer one, with real equal opportunities for access, and an enhanced confidence in university admissions, then it will be worth it. </p> <p>In 20 years time though, I wonder whether politicians and others will be taking a snipe at things like SATS or PQA. And perhaps there will always be people who play any system. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Delyth Chambers is Chair of the Russell Group of Admissions Officers, and currently Director of Admissions and Recruitment at the University of Birmingham.

  "<p>At least 47 people were killed at a Baghdad market today in an explosion that was believed to have been targeted at a nearby police station.</p> <p>A huge blast tore through the crowded market close to the west Baghdad police headquarters on Haifa Street, a main thoroughfare running through some of the city's most impoverished districts where support for the country's insurgency is strong.</p> <p>It left 114 wounded and was the deadliest attack in the capital for six months. Violence has flared in Iraq in the last week as the US has attempted to pacify areas under rebel control.</p> <p>Hours after the Baghdad attack, 12 police were killed when their minibus was ambushed by militants in Baquba, 40 miles north of the capital.</p> <p>Iraqi police are thought of as collaborators by the insurgents, while the US and interim Iraqi government consider them vital to ensure stability if elections are to take place in January.</p> <p>A militant group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the US's most wanted man in Iraq, claimed both attacks. \"With the grace of God, a lion from our martyrdom brigades was successful in striking a centre for apostate police volunteers,\" the military wing of the Tawhid and Jihad group said in its statement on the Baghdad bombing.</p> <p>The US army and Iraqi interior ministry blamed a car bomb but witnesses said there may have been at least two simultaneous explosions and possibly mortars.</p> <p>\"I was standing there talking to my friend when suddenly all I saw was blood, and my friend lying dead,\" an Iraqi man who gave his name as Zafer told Reuters from his hospital bed.</p> <p>Rescuers pulled bodies from mangled market stalls and lay them out on pavements strewn with chairs, glass and rubble from blown-out shop fronts. Dazed bystanders vainly checked the bodies for signs of life.</p> <p>Smoke from blazing vehicles in the middle of the street billowed into the sky as firefighters attempted to douse the flames. Ambulances ferried the dead and wounded to hospital as US helicopters buzzed overhead.</p> <p>Iraq's interim interior minister, Falah al-Naqib, visited the site and condemned the attackers. \"They are targeting the Iraqi people, and they are trying to destroy Iraq. These powers won't stop the rebuilding of Iraq,\" he said.</p> <p>Haifa Street has been the scene of frequent clashes between US-led forces and Sunni guerrillas. On Sunday, when over 100 people in total were killed across Iraq, US helicopters fired at Iraqis standing near a destroyed US Bradley armoured vehicle in the street.</p> <p>At least five people were killed, including a producer for al-Arabiya television. G2 columnist Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, who was injured in the attack, today <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1303827,00.html\">described the carnage</a> after the helicopter strike, and revealed how fortunate he was to have walked away alive.</p> <p>\"Time didn't exist. The streets were empty and silent, and the men lay there dying together. [One of the injured men] slid down to the ground, and after five minutes was flat on the street,\" he wrote. </p> <p>The same day there were multiple car bomb and mortar attacks in central Baghdad, while US-led forces continued assaults on Falluja and the border town of Tal Afar, an alleged haven for foreign fighters.</p> <p>The Turkish government has accused the US of using excessive force at Tal Afar, which is home to minority Iraqi Turkmen, and Ankara has threatened to end its cooperation with Washington on Iraq.</p> <p>Also today, Saboteurs blew up a junction where multiple oil pipelines cross the Tigris at Beiji in northern Iraq.

  "The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog today said he was not certain that Iran's nuclear ambitions were entirely peaceful - but added he had seen no evidence to back allegations that the country was attempting to build a bomb. <p>Speaking to reporters ahead of a closed door meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors about Iran, Mohammed ElBaradei said there was no smoking gun to back US claims that Iran was pursuing nuclear weapons.</p> <p>\"Have we seen any proof of a weapons programme? Have we seen undeclared [uranium] enrichment? There is none of that,\" Mr ElBaradei said. \"But are we in a position to say that everything is peaceful? Obviously we are not at this stage.\" </p> <p>The IAEA board is this week considering a joint French, British and German resolution calling on it to make a final decision about Iran at a November meeting. It would have the option of referring Iran to the UN security council for sanctions if it still had doubts about its nuclear programme.</p> <p>Iran, with Russian assistance and fuel, has been building civilian reactors to produce electricity, but the three European countries and the US fear it could produce weapons-grade fuel if it mines and enriches its own uranium. </p> <p>The Europeans began a policy of \"constructive engagement\" with Tehran in October 2003 in an attempt it to persuade it end enrichment, but have shown signs of losing patience and moving towards Washington's position.</p> <p>Iran promised to suspend its uranium enrichment programme in exchange for a wide range of \"carrots\" - including non-military nuclear and other technology and a guarantee that it could keep a peaceful atomic programme - but it has not yet done so.</p> <p>Hossein Mousavian, the country's chief delegate at this week's IAEA meeting, yesterday adopted a defiant stance when he said Iran would begin enriching uranium very soon.</p> <p>Diplomats said Iran and the three European countries were quietly negotiating behind the scenes, and would soon announce a more comprehensive suspension of Iran's enrichment programme.</p> <p>Mr Mousavian told Reuters that Tehran wanted to bring the standoff over its nuclear programme to a head in November. \"We have nothing against serious dialogue aimed at providing assurances that Iran's nuclear programme will never, never be diverted to military purposes,\" he said in an interview.</p> <p>Mr ElBaradei said he hoped the resolution would prompt Iran and other countries to improve cooperation with the IAEA.</p> <p>\"It is important to acknowledge progress and say we would like to see accelerated cooperation by Iran [and] by the countries that have been involved,\" he said in a clear reference to Pakistan, which provided much of Tehran's previously secret uranium enrichment technology.</p> <p>Iran claims traces of highly enriched uranium on its centrifuges were the result of contamination due to it buying the parts on the black market.</p>",
  "<p>Had anyone failed to spot that Paolo di Canio was back in Italy, they'll have no excuses now; the great man's antics in Genoa dominated the opening round of the Serie A season, in a weekend that also saw returns from Juan Veron and Gianfranco Zola, a fine debut goal for Juve's Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and a brisk come-uppance for the two Milanese sides.</p> <p>But first things first: on Sunday night Lazio travelled to Sampdoria for the start of their toughest season in years. Lazio these days are flat broke and unfancied, and a long way from their largesse of old; they only pulled together a third of their squad on the final day of the transfer market, new manager Mimmo Caso is on just \u00a360,000 a season (only slightly more than predecessor Roberto Mancini made in a week), while di Canio, the one big signing, had to accept a 70% pay cut from Charlton just to come to the aid of his beloved former team.</p> <p>Di Canio duly started on Sunday night, and 25 minutes in, produced the moment that turned the game. With his back to goal, Paolo nonchalantly flicked the ball through to forward Simone Inzaghi, who found himself one-on-one with the Sampdoria 'keeper Francesco Antonioli. This proved confusing for both of them; Inzaghi's flailing attempts to control the ball were misread as a dummy by Antonioli, who promptly upended the Lazio striker. Red card for he, penalty for Lazio.</p> <p>Up strides Inzaghi, the side's designated penalty taker, but di Canio already has the ball in his arms and no intention of letting it go. \"It is mine. MINE!\" he indicates to his hapless colleague. A frustrated Inzaghi looks over to the sidelines, where manager Caso is shouting at him to go and take the kick. \"He won't let me\" pouts the striker, pointing at Paolo (subtext: he can have me and we both know it). Di Canio duly slots the ball away, and he races towards the Sampdoria fans to celebrate. The rest of the team follow him bar Simone, who stands looking hurt in the centre-circle.</p> <p>Spare a thought for Inzaghi. A player who's greatest achievement in football has been making his brother Pippo seem manly, he now has Mr Testosterone as a forward partner. And it won't be easy; Sunday, as soon as di Canio had finished squabbling with the Sampdoria players post-goal, he raced up and grabbed Simone by the shirt, incensed by his lack of celebration. So furious was di Canio's expression that players from both teams raced to separate the two. \"We had words, sure, but this penalty was just too important to me\" explained Paolo later. \"This kind of thing is healthy for the club.\" Well, quite. The rest of the game was hugely uneventful despite Lazio's numerical superiority, but they can be pleased with three points that few would have predicted.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Rudi V\u00f6ller's reign at Roma got off to a winning start with a 1-0 win over Fiorentina, a club who've raced back from the fourth to the first division in just two seasons, thanks, we can only assume, to wormholes in the space-time continuum and/or chums at the FA. With Fiorentina down to ten men early on, Roma started well, Antonio Cassano striking the frame from distance with a volley so nonchalant he practically had his hands in his pockets when he hit it.</p> <p>However, soon afterwards Cassano himself was shown the red card for angrily pushing an opponent to the ground. Coming just a few days after he stormed out of training, Cassano's latest indiscipline is worrying news for Roma, a club that has, after all, just replaced strict disciplinarian Fabio Capello with V\u00f6ller, a man known in German football circles as 'auntie'. </p> <p>V\u00f6ller proved spot on, however, with his half-time substitutions. Vincenzo Montella came on for Vincent Candela and promptly scored the winner, racing onto a masterfully delivered ball from Daniele de Rossi and chipping the keeper. Prior to Sunday, 'Aeroplanino' Montella hadn't scored in 10 months, which may explain why Roma spent the summer trying to offload him - however, with him back in form alongside Francesco Totti and Cassano, Roma's prospects improve immeasurably.</p> <p>Going into the season, the big three of Milan, Internazionale and Juventus were everybody's favourites - but of these only Juve actually started with a win this weekend. At Brescia, a ground where they've struggled in recent seasons, Juve scored three, conceded none, and generally looked light years on from last season. Tight marking from Brescia kept it close until Pavel Nedved headed in the opener half an hour in. Three minutes later and a Nedved-Zebina one-two set up David Trezeguet for the second, the third coming from Ibrahimovic early in the second half - the tall Swede sweeping into the area and shaking off three Brescia defenders before firing underneath the keeper. It was 'a dream start' he said afterwards, and the rest of the side would no doubt agree.</p> <p>As for the Milanese pair, Milan were held 2-2 at home to newly-promoted Livorno, in a game which saw Milan's keeper Dida sent off just nine minutes in for an ill-timed challenge in the area, while Inter drew away to Chievo by the same scoreline. For the Nerazzurri there were positive notes going forward, with Veron involved in both goals and Christian Vieri and Adriano combining well for the second, but there were also the usual worries at the back, where the dream team of Sinisa Mihajlovic and Marco Materazzi left Francesco Toldo's goal about as well protected as a Buckingham balcony. A 2-2 draw away to Chievo is by no means a terrible result, but it is enough to spark ominous thoughts among Inter fans all too used to watching other teams doing all the winning. Still, early doors, eh? </p> <p>Next weekend, Milan visit Bologna, Juventus host Atalanta, and Roma travel to Messina, while Saturday night's game gives Internazionale a chance to bounce back in front of their own fans, hosting spunky new-boys Palermo at the San Siro. Inter-Palermo will be live on British Eurosport, but for the sad few who won't be able to follow it there, rest assured we'll have all the details here next week. See you then.</p>",
  "The trial of 17 alleged members of the Red Brigades began in Rome yesterday, and the decision of one of their number to collaborate with the authorities could contribute to the definitive dismantling of the Marxist revolutionary group. <p>Cinzia Banelli, a hospital technician from Pisa who was known by her colleagues as Comrade So, has been providing magistrates with information about her alleged accomplices since July. </p> <p>Her conversion to supergrass stems from the arrival of a son, Filippo, who was born behind bars six months ago, and the realisation that her violent political activity had contributed to four \"completely useless\" deaths. </p> <p>During the 70s and 80s, Italy's Red Brigades were one of the most feared terrorist organisations in Europe, striking at politicians, businessmen and the security services with apparent impunity. </p> <p>The 1978 kidnapping and murder of the former prime minister, Aldo Moro - one of the most influential leaders of the dominant Christian Democrat party - marked a high point for Red Brigades power. </p> <p>However, the emergence of so-called pentiti - who traded information on their accomplices for lighter prison sentences - and the progressive rejection of political violence by Italian society saw the organisation slide into what appeared to be terminal decline by the late 80s. </p> <p>Banelli's decision to turn informer looks likely to mark the end of the adventure for the latest generation of brigatisti, who apparently believed they could alter the course of history by the occasional assassination of obscure and unprotected government advisers. </p> <p>Investigators hope her example will now be followed by other members of the organisation who are less impressed by the chimera of a distant revolution than the immediate prospect of a lifetime behind bars.</p> <p>The \"useless deaths\" cited by Banelli in conversations with her lawyer were those of two government labour law advisers, Massimo D'Antona and Marco Biagi - who were gunned down in the street for their efforts to modernise the Italian economy - and a Red Brigades comrade and police officer who died in a shootout on a train in March of last year. </p> <p>So far, police successes in identifying Red Brigades suspects have come through telephone analysis, tracking the movements of alleged terrorists through their use of cellphones and public phone cards. </p> <p>Further information has been gathered from the capture of two personal digital assistants after the incident on the train, which led to the arrest of one of the organisation's new leaders, Nadia Desdemona Lioce. </p> <p>Now investigators have an intimate account of the group's activities from Comrade So - a story periodically interrupted to allow her to breastfeed her son. </p> <p>The picture that emerges is one of bumbling incompetence. An attempt to hold up a post office in Florence in December 2002 failed, according to So's account, when one of the terrorists sat on a remote control device, prematurely releasing a cloud of smoke and tear gas inside a Red Brigades van. </p> <p>So herself had been suspended from the organisation for failing to turn up on time for a planned fundraising robbery. However, the group declined to expel her because of her personal relationship with Lioce and the damage she was capable of doing if she went to the police. </p> <p>Matters were patched up after So handed over part of a lottery prize she had received from her father. </p> <p>Investigators hope her evidence will help them to identify a further two or three terrorists still believed to be at large, and to recover a cache of pistols and a rifle still at the Red Brigades' disposal. </p> <p>Valuable clues could be available in her laptop computer, for which she has handed over the access codes - one of them a phrase taken from the writings of Che Guevara. </p> <p>If revolutionary rhetoric seems anachronistic in the Italy of the 21st century, it was still on display in the Rome courtroom, where imprisoned alleged Red Brigades members yesterday gave the clenched fist salute, invoked the \"unity of all proletarian forces\" and expressed their support for the Iraqi resistance and the Palestinian intifada. </p> <p>However, the ferocity involved in killing unarmed intellectuals for their ideas has alienated all but the tiniest minority of Italian public opinion - a lesson, perhaps, for other far more ruthless terrorists who set no limits on their capacity for cruelty and destruction.</p>",
  "<p>Just over a week ago, Frank McGuinness was glued to the TV and the terrible images that were emerging in the wake of the siege at School Number One in Beslan. He dragged himself away to go to the first run-through of his latest play, a new version of Euripides's rarely performed Hecuba. When the rehearsal finished, everybody in the room was silent, so acutely aware were they of the parallels between this 2,500-year-old Greek tragedy and the grim scenario unfolding in Russia.</p> <p>\"Everyone at the rehearsal felt such despair at what had happened at Breslan. You think, what can we possibly do?\" says McGuinness. \"All we can do is produce and perform the play, knowing that Euripides's words speak directly to us about what we humans are capable of doing to each other and our children.\" </p> <p>Set in the aftermath of the defeat of Troy, Hecuba charts the grief and revenge of the deposed queen who has seen her husband and sons humiliated and slaughtered and her daughters raped and dragged off to be enslaved by the enemy. There was a time when McGuinness was \"scared\" of Greek tragedy, although that changed when he adapted Electra for the Donmar in 1997; with Zoe Wanamaker in the lead, the production subsequently transferred to rapturous acclaim on Broadway. But if Electra was gritty, then Hecuba is as hard and unforgiving as a piece of granite. </p> <p>It is often thought of as a broken-backed play, or two entirely different plays, as the suffering Hecuba of the first half is transformed into the terrifying, avenging dark angel of the second. McGuinness is having none of that kind of talk. \"There is a very clear psychological journey. I understand this woman. I understand very well what it is like to live in the aftermath of war.\" </p> <p>So he should. Born in 1953 in the seaside town of Buncrana in County Donegal, close to the border with Derry, McGuinness has lived through the long war in Northern Ireland and the terrible violence that has erupted during the attempts to make the peace. He sees himself very much as a chronicler of conflict. In his first major success 20 years ago, Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, he wrote so well of the experiences of the Ulster volunteers in the trenches of the first world war that to this day some people assume he was brought up a Protestant, not a Catholic. In Dolly West's Kitchen, set in Buncrana during the second world war, he shows the dangers of remaining neutral, either politically or morally, in times of war. One of his best known plays, Someone to Watch Over Me, meanwhile, was inspired by the hostage-taking in the civil war-riven Beirut of the 1980s. </p> <p>\"If I hadn't been born where and when I was, I doubt I would have become a playwright,\" he admits. \"But if you want to write about war and its impact on people's lives, plays are a good form to choose. To put it at its crudest, plays are conflict, and I find conflict interesting.\" </p> <p>The war in Iraq and the subsequent bloody so-called peace has seen a recent spate of revived and rewritten Greek tragedies that appear on our stages as if as a reflection of the political situation. But it was the aftermath of the war in Ireland and the peace process of the mid-1990s, not the war in Iraq, that McGuinness had in mind when he first started work on Hecuba. The Omagh bombing in particular was the catalyst. </p> <p>\"Two of the children who died that day came from the same estate in Buncrana where I grew up. At their funeral, the sister of one of the boys started crying and the sound she made seemed to come from the earth itself. It made me think about a grief so terrible and powerful and what it can do.\" He pauses and as he continues you can hear the regret in his voice: \"I heard that sound again when I was watching the women of Beslan crying for their children. It was the same sound multiplied many, many times.\" </p> <p>McGuinness is genuinely horrified that events in Russia mean that Hecuba is an even more potent comment on the terrible pain of grief and the cycle of atrocities and revenge that can follow. He believes that, unlike war poets, war playwrights need a little distance from the events they are dealing with. \"Unlike the poet, the playwright doesn't articulate one person's experience or psyche. In a play, you create a multitude of characters and viewpoints and to do that you need some distance. If you are too emotionally or politically engaged, it isn't good for the play. If you let righteousness carry you away, you are not writing theatre, you are writing propaganda.\" </p> <p>Three years ago, when September 11 happened, McGuinness was just beginning to write a short play for the National Theatre. \"I knew at once that September 11 would have a major impact on my creative life. The National commission gave me the opportunity to address it - but the very last thing I wanted to do was respond immediately. I wanted to take my time. I don't want to be on my soapbox or offering prophecies to the world. I don't like prophets.\" </p> <p>But when a play takes a long time to write - and McGuinness's version of Hecuba has taken six years - events can overtake it. The war in Iraq was happening as McGuinness was working on the text, and having seen in Ireland the difficulty of achieving peace after conflict, he was not impressed by Bush's glib pronouncements of \"mission accomplished\". </p> <p>\"I am certainly not a pacifist; pacifism is not an adequate political philosophy. I firmly believe that there are times when you have to take up arms - and I have respect for all those men and women who are most reluctant to do so, but who feel in the end that they must. It is no accident that that warmonger George W Bush has never been to war himself or that Tony Blair has never done service and is so willing to send his own people to fight lunatic wars. If you create an environment where the waging of war is your solution, you are in terrible danger of unleashing something terrifying and demonic that you will never be able to control. </p> <p>\"War plays remind us of that. Hecuba reminds us of that. It is not a comforting play, particularly not for these dangerous times when there is so much grief. It shows that there is a dark hardness that we all possess, and that the impulse for revenge and war comes from within us all. That means nobody is safe.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Hecuba opens at the Donmar Warehouse, London WC1, tomorrow. Box office: 0870 060 6624</p>",
  "<p>The scene of the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today is Darfur, in western Sudan. But despite our large media window onto the world, few of our students are likely to have any great knowledge of Sudan - the largest country in Africa.</p> <p>The crisis in Darfur emanates from the longest-running civil war in Africa. There has been a history of war in Sudan's recent past, but this particular conflict began in 1983, when the Arab government in the north tried to impose Islamic sharia law throughout Sudan, including the south where the black African population follows traditional African beliefs or Christianity.</p> <p>A ceasefire and peace agreement has been agreed between the government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), including a deal to split valuable oil revenues from southern oilfields.</p> <p>But this has sparked demands from rebels in Darfur for a fairer deal for the black African population there, where the differences tend to be ethnic and cultural rather than religious (the people of Darfur, whether their first language is Arabic or an African language, are traditionally Muslim).</p> <p><strong>Ethnic cleansing</strong></p> <p>The government responded by backing the Arab Janjaweed militias who have run riot, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of over 1 million people as they flee for their lives. The rest of the world has glimpsed the spectre of ethnic cleansing raising its ugly head again and, with memories of Rwanda and Kosovo still fresh, the international community does not want to be accused of a slow, ineffective response. (Last week the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, described the violence as \"genocide\".)</p> <p>A UN resolution has been passed, calling for the Sudanese government to disarm and disband the Janjaweed militias, so that humanitarian aid can be distributed effectively.</p> <p>The Sudanese government's response has been slow and reluctant. There is little evidence of effective measures to lessen the atrocities being committed by the Janjaweed. As a result, the suffering of the Sudanese refugees continues.</p> <p><strong>Odd-one-out</strong></p> <p>You can begin to find out what your students know about Sudan by playing a simple game of \"odd-one-out\".</p> <p>Put the name of Sudan on the board with the names of two other countries - ones they may be more familiar with or that have been in the news too, for example the United Kingdom, South Africa, Israel or Russia. In pairs, students should be asked to discuss the similarities and differences - geographical, economic, physical, historical, religious, etc - and should try to decide which country is the odd-one-out. Encourage them to be imaginative, inquiring and speculative in their reasoning.</p> <p>There is no right answer, of course, but the value of the exercise is to assess prior knowledge as well as stimulate their interest in finding out more.</p> <p>They can follow this up by creating a list of 10 questions about Sudan, with the opportunity to research and share the answers. The <a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/\">CIA World Factbook</a> gives useful county profiles and is a good first port of call.</p> <p><strong>Deplorable conditions</strong><br></p> <p>Despite the images students may have seen on the television news, it may be difficult for students to appreciate the circumstances and suffering in Darfur. Challenge them to consider what life must be like in the refugee camps. Save the Children has described subsistence conditions as \"deplorable\".</p> <p>Encourage students to investigate the idea of what \"deplorable\" living conditions might be like. Divide the class into groups of five. Give each student one area of focus from the following list: healthcare; shelter; food and water; education; friends and family.</p> <p>Once they have been given their focus, they move into a new group - an \"expert\" group - with all the others with that focus. The students can discuss the problems associated with their area of focus before moving back to their original groups to share their findings and create a picture - in image or words - of how life might be in the refugee camps.</p> <p><strong>Children caught in conflict</strong><br></p> <p>Save the Children, one of many aid agencies operational in Darfur, is working hard to provide basic necessities such as food, water and healthcare in camps such as Abu Shok in north Darfur. Out of 40,000 people in the camp, three-quarters are children. Students might be helped to understand something of the children's situation by reading individual experiences. Save the Children cites the case of Setcania, a six-year-old child who walked 60km to Abu Shok to escape violence.</p> <p>Setcania, like most children at the camp, enjoys the prospect of school: \"School is what we most want.\"</p> <p>There are 11 schools for the 30,000 children in Abu Shok. As well as discussing whether they value education like Setcania does, your students might want to do a little basic maths on the numbers involved, and to discuss the problems of education in the camp.</p> <p>Encourage them to research other case studies, and to look at first-hand accounts in newspapers and on charity websites.</p> <p><strong>Curriculum links and guidance</strong></p> <p><strong>This lesson is written for KS3 (age 11-14) but can be adapted for other ages</strong></p> <p><strong>Key stage 2</strong><br></p> <p>Introduce the geography of Sudan with a map game. Arrange students in groups of four and challenge them to draw an accurate map of Sudan from memory. In each group, each child should be numbered one to four. First invite the \"ones\" to your table and show them a map of Sudan (with a bold outline and main features, eg towns, mountain ranges, Blue Nile, White Nile). Give them 30 seconds to study the map, then ask them to return to their group and spend two minutes drawing as much of the map as they remember. Invite the \"twos\" to your desk and repeat the process, until all the students have done some of the drawing. Adjust the timings and the demands to suit the needs of your group. Encourage students to appreciate the size of the country (Sudan is roughly the same size as western Europe) and to find out more about Sudan, eg the size of its population (40m), climate and resources, flag. See the <a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/\">CIA World Factbook</a> for a useful country profile.</p> <p><strong>Key stage 4</strong></p> <p>The question of interference in the affairs in other countries is topical, particularly after the war in Iraq. Discuss whether it is ever right for a country or countries to intervene because they don't like what is happening in another country. Have a class vote.</p> <p>Then discuss what actions countries can take, for instance military intervention or economic, political or social sanctions. In what circumstances might such interventions be acceptable? Look at examples, eg South Africa, Cuba, Chile, Afghanistan.</p> <p>Now turn to Sudan and ask if there should be any international action. Explain the role the UN has in deciding whether to take action, and the difficulty of gaining unanimous support for action (the resolution calling for Sudan's government to halt the atrocities was only passed after the word \"sanctions\" was dropped, and both China and Pakistan abstained).</p> <p>Finally, put the students into groups and give each group member a role - for example aid worker, refugee, member of the Sudanese government, person from a neighbouring country - and debate the issues. Research time would help.</p> <p>Finally, repeat your class vote, to see if opinions have changed.</p> <p><strong>Curriculum links</strong></p> <p><strong>KS2</strong><br> <strong>English</strong> En1 2a-; En2 2a-d, 3a-d,5e <br><strong>Geography</strong> 1a-c, 2a-g, 3a-f <br><strong>PSHE and Citizenship</strong> 2a,e,k 4b <br><strong>Citizenship at key stages 1 and 2</strong> Unit 05: Living in a diverse world <br><strong>Geography at key stages 1 and 2</strong> Unit 16: What's in the news?; Unit 24: Passport to the world</p> <p><strong>KS3</strong><br> <strong>Citizenship</strong> 1a,b, f-i, 2a-c, 3a-c <br><strong>English</strong> En1 1a-g, 2a-f, 3a-e; En2 1a-e, 4a-d, 5a-d; En3 1g-h <br><strong>Geography</strong> 1 d-e, 2 c-e, 3a-e <br><strong>PSHE</strong> 3a,b <br><strong>Citizenship at key stage 3</strong> Unit 03: Human rights; Unit 11: Why is it so difficult to keep the peace in the world today?; Unit 13: How do we deal with conflict? <br><strong>Geography at key stage 3</strong> (Year 8) Unit 12: Images of a country; (Year 9) Unit 20: Comparing countries</p> <p><strong>KS4</strong><br> <strong>Citizenship</strong> 1a,b, f, g, j, 2a-c, 3a-c <br><strong>English</strong> En1 1a-g, 2a-f, 3a-e En2 1a-e, 4a-d, 5a-d <br><strong>PSHE</strong> 3a-c <br><strong>Citizenship at key stage 4</strong> Unit 01: Human rights <br><strong>Scottish Curriculum 5-14</strong><br> <strong>English language levels</strong> C-F <br><strong>Environmental studies</strong> C-F</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong><a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/\">www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/</a><br> Useful country profiles</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong><a href=\"http://www.un.org/ \">www.un.org/</a><br> The United Nations, which calls for the militias to be disbanded</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong><a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/\">www.savethechildren.org.uk/</a><br> Case studies, explanations and reports from aid workers in Sudan</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sudan/\">www.theguardian.com/sudan/</a><br> A Guardian special report</p> <p><strong>Resources on learnpremium.co.uk</strong></p> <p>Students can find out more about Sudan on <a href=\"http://www.learnpremium.co.uk\">learnpremium.co.uk</a>, the Guardian's subscription-based website for schools.

  "<p>Unnoticed by the rest of the country, British universities have been changing drastically over the past few years, a report to vice-chancellors today will reveal. </p> <p>The expansion has been obvious but this has concealed the fact that overseas and European Union students are making up an ever greater proportion of the university population while more and more home students are opting for the part-time route to control debts and improve their employability when they graduate. </p> <p>Members of Universities UK gathering in Oxford this week will be more aware of these changes than the rest of us but results of the study into the state of the sector by Professor Brian Ramsden will put their debates into a new perspective. </p> <p>The advent of variable top-up fees for home undergraduates from 2006, for instance, is only part of a wider picture in which institutions must get their pricing right for part-timers and postgraduates as well as the typical 18-year-old school leaver that the politicians are focused on. </p> <p>His conclusion that universities' finances are getting more precarious will focus their minds - and will no doubt figure in their lobbying of ministers over the government's spending review.</p> <p>\"An overall increase of 33% [in the student population] over the last seven years masks the fact that there have been greater increases in the number of postgraduates compared with undergraduates, and in part-time students compared with full-time,\" notes Professor Ramsden, former head of the Higher Education Statistics Agency, who looked at figures from 1994 to 2002.</p> <p>It has also masked the faster rise in the number of EU students - 37% compared with 31% for home students - and a staggering 60% jump in the numbers of other international students. </p> <p>Changes to the admissions system recommended by the Schwartz review today are of great political importance because they touch on the glittering prizes - places at Oxbridge and other prestigious institutions and oversubscribed courses like medicine and law.</p> <p>Naturally the vice-chancellors will be debating them at their conference in Keble College and will be addressed by Charles Clarke, the education secretary, on the subject. But the proposals are irrelevant to the admission of the majority of undergraduates except in the sense of trying to restore public faith in the whole system. </p> <p>Where the impact of the Brunel vice-chancellor, Steven Schwartz, will be felt is in possible changes to the university year - whose seasonal dates have survived more or less unchanged since medieval times - to accommodate an admissions system based on actual exam results rather than predictions. Expect a lot of niggling and wriggling.</p> <p>Commenting on the Ramsden report, Sir David Watson, vice-chancellor of Brighton University, said the shift to more part-time undergraduate study and the reverse at postgraduate level showed increased interest in 'earning and learning'.</p> <p>He said the report showed the difficulty universities and colleges have had in responding to changes in student demand for particular subjects - \"the metaphor of the supertanker springs to mind.\" </p> <p>The \"apparently inexorable\" concentration of research funding in a small number of institutions continues, the report shows, despite being described as \"dysfunctional\" by Universities UK. Professor Ramsden also reveals that working class students continue to be concentrated in certain institutions.</p> <p>Professor Ramsden raises one difficult issue which the government and the universities have yet to grapple with - the mismatch between the English regions and where universities are sited. There is really no logical relationship between the natural groupings of universities and the nine regions which the government hopes will take on a much greater role in higher education and research related to business and industry. It sounds like a recipe for muddle and waste.</p>",
  "<p>Influential media regulator Ofcom today set out its blueprint for switching off the analogue TV signal, a move that will ultimately affect up to to 90 million sets, in just three years' time.</p> <p>Ofcom, which governs all commercial TV in the country including ITV, Channel 4 and Five, said it was technically possible to phase in digital-only areas as early as 2007.</p> <p>And it said broadcasters must switch off the analogue signal by the end of 2012 - a date already considered feasible by the BBC director general, Mark Thompson.</p> <p>Ofcom's statement today gave fresh impetus to the government's plans to ensure the UK becomes the world's first country to have a digital-only TV network.</p> <p>About half the country currently has digital TV in some form - through satellite, cable or Freeview connections - but it is widely agreed that the consumer acceptance of digital will plateau and the government will have to intervene by setting a firm date for switching off analogue transmitters.</p> <p>Ofcom said ITV, Channel 4 and Five - which are to be given new licences at the end of this year - would have to comply with December 31 2012 as a \"backstop date\", by which time they should have stopped broadcasting their analogue services.</p> <p>The timetable follows up on the announcement earlier this year by the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, that 2012 might be the most appropriate date to complete the switchover.</p> <p>Up until now the government had been officially put forward a target date for phasing out analogue between 2006 and 2010.</p> <p>Trials of digital-only networks will start next spring in two Welsh villages where hundreds have agreed to abandon analogue TV.</p> <p>While around14 million of the UK's 25 million homes have taken the digital route, one of the big challenges for the government is persuaded householders to convert every TV in their homes. There are an estimated 80 million-plus sets in the country.</p> <p>The second challenge is convincing the hardcore of \"refuseniks\", and the government may eventually be forced to pay for them to switch over to digital.</p> <p>Ministers are keen to push through the process in order to free up the analogue spectrum and put the UK at the vanguard of the digital revolution.</p> <p>Ofcom also said today that broadcasters would have to cover the country as extensively under their new licences as their analogue service does now, which will involve rolling out the digital terrestrial service to 1,154 transmission sites.</p> <p>At the moment a significant minority of homes are unable to pick up Freeview, the cheapest form of digital TV that does not require the payment of a subscription.</p> <p>The regulator said it had already held discussions with broadcasters before preparing its drafts of the new digital replacement licences.</p> <p>These are the terms by which broadcasters will be given access to the analogue and digital spectrum over the 10-year period between 2005 and 2014.</p> <p>Built into the licences are conditions relating to \"the public service broadcasting remits of licensees and statements of programme policy\".</p> <p>Ofcom has asked for responses to its proposals to be submitted by October 25. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the regulator is working with broadcasters, the government, consumer groups and others to develop SwitchCo, a body responsible for ensuring switchover happens and providing consumer information and advice.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "13-year-old boy shot dead during a night-time hunting expedition, after he was apparently mistaken for a fox, was named by police last night as Byron Evans from east Devon. Byron was shot with a single bullet during a \"lamping\" expedition on Saturday night and died in hospital. He was among a party of three adults and three youngsters and was shot on land around Lower Cholwell Farm, near the village of Harberton, south Devon. Byron was a friend of one of the landowner's sons, it was reported. \"Lamping\" hunters use strong lights which are sometimes attached to vehicles to transfix prey so that they can be shot with a rifle or shotgun. Police were combing the area where the shooting happened yesterday. The greater Devon coroner, Elizabeth Earland, will open and adjourn an inquest this week. A Devon and Cornwall police spokesman said that no one had been arrested over the incident. He added: \"It appeared the teenager was a member of a small party who were out with the intention of hunting foxes.\" The Harberton parish council chairman, John Hockings, said yesterday that he was baffled by the incident. I can't understand it. Efficient, professional lampers would be able to tell by the different colour of the eyes what they were shooting.\" Mr Hockings said he believed Byron's stepfather had been with him in the hunting party, but it was not known who fired the fatal shot. The British Association for Shooting and Conservation said lamping could be a \"safe and effective\" method of pest and predator control, but that the incident highlighted its potential hazards. In its code of practice, the association says that hunters should familiarise themselves with the area in daylight before shooting. The organisation stresses: Never shoot at 'a pair of eyes' unless you can clearly identify the body of the animal. Always ensure a safe background and clear field of fire. Never shoot over the crest of hills.\" It warns that rifle bullets and shotgun pellets could ricochet off bushes, fence wire and other obstacles. If in doubt, do not shoot,\" the advice says. Rob Williams, the headteacher at Byron's school, St Peter's in Lympstone, Devon, said in a statement yesterday that the pupils and teachers were devastated. He was popular and vivacious and loved his rugby and was passionate about his drama,\" Mr Williams said. The school community trying to come to terms with such awful news and our thoughts and prayers are very much with his family as they to come to terms with all that has happened over the weekend.\" The local vicar, the Rev John Ough, said that prayers were said \"for all those caught up in this incident\".",
  "<p>Love them or loathe them, there's no denying that members of campaign group Fathers 4 Justice have done an award-winning job in hijacking the nation's, if not the world's, attention. </p> <p>As a public relations coup, it ranks as one of the most successful in recent times: an audacious yet unfeasibly simply plan, quickly executed with a touch of humour and a serious message with a knock-on effect for the not entirely inconsequential matter of national security.</p> <p>Batman's crusading exploits received blanket coverage on the television and radio news bulletins yesterday, is still the main item today, and all the national newspapers gave it substantial coverage.</p> <p>And while the public debate about palace security will rage for days, within the royal court, government and the police force it will rage a lot longer. It is being called the \"most embarrassing breach of palace security yet\". Heads could roll. </p> <p>Dressed as Batman, dissatisfied father-of two Jason Hatch scaled Buckingham Palace's fa\u00e7ade on Monday afternoon and spent five hours waving to all and sundry live on TV while armed police and Buckingham Palace security were powerless to act.</p> <p>His sidekick Robin, AKA fellow Fathers 4 Justice member Dave Pyke, abandoned his attempt to join Batman when he was threatened with being shot. Fair enough. </p> <p>Robin \"got away\" from the police and spent the next hour or so acting as an extremely articulate spokesman for the group, giving erudite comments about excluded fathers' plights to the other media who had by this time descended, helicopters and all, on Buck Palace.</p> <p>Dressed in black suit, cape and mask Mr Pyke did what many campaigners who partake in guerrilla-style direct action stunts never quite manage - he came across as measured, sensible and ordinary. </p> <p>He stressed his group's resolutely non-violent ethic in its campaign of civil disobedience to raise awareness of the plight of men denied access to their children.</p> <p>He just appeared to be so desperate to see his kids he'd dress up like a cartoon character and get on national TV by fair means or foul. Which is more than enough to embarrass them for life.</p> <p>Mr Pyke was finally tapped on the shoulder by a policeman during one of his interviews and bundled in to the back of a police van live on Sky News.</p> <p>Home secretary David Blunkett didn't seem to mind the palace intrusion so much as the fact that the incident should overshadow his speech today outlining national standards for the police. </p> <p>\"This is what I sometimes call sod's law in this job, I'm afraid,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.</p> <p>He then went on to state the blindingly obvious - that not all security systems \"worked perfectly\" yesterday. Well done Sherlock.</p> <p>Yesterday's Buckingham Palace escapade is the latest in a series of high-profile stunts carried out by Fathers 4 Justice to draw attention to their campaign.</p> <p>Members have chucked a purple flour bomb at Tony Blair during prime minister's question time, sat on a crane dressed as Spider-Man holding up traffic at London's Tower Bridge for six days, scaled the Tamar Bridge in Plymouth, occupied the offices of the Department for Constitutional Affairs and stormed the family division of the high court. </p> <p>These aren't trained PR professionals who have spent years honing their attention-grabbing skills to maximise clients' budgets. Mr Hatch, for instance, is a painter and decorator.</p> <p>Nonetheless, many members face trial for their activities during protests but, like other campaigners such as Greenpeace's environmental warriors, they would undoubtedly say the wrath they face is worth it because their plight is now firmly implanted in the national conscience.</p> <p>Mr Hatch is facing a criminal damage charge and Mr Pyke is facing one of aiding and abetting his colleague.</p> <p>It isn't all positive PR though, the group's actions could be proof the men are irresponsible and unreasonable - and as Jon Snow pointed out in his daily email to Channel 4 News fans, \"This would be a fantastic agit prop. Were it not for the atmosphere around the 'cause'. 'Fathers for Justice' is campaigning for fathers to have access to children in their mother's custody. But such is the aura of misogyny, and the utter obsessiveness [of the campaign] you find yourself wondering whether ANY child should ever be exposed to their care.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "Allegations that American soldiers routinely tortured and maltreated detainees have emerged from a third Iraqi city, renewing fears that abuse similar to that inflicted in Abu Ghraib jail in Baghdad has been systematic and widespread. <p>American soldiers in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul beat and stripped detainees, threatened sexual abuse and forced them to listen to loud western music, according to statements seen by the Guardian. </p> <p>Lawyers investigating the claims have sent details to the Pentagon and the British Ministry of Defence and have demanded an inquiry. </p> <p>Though the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib jail and in Basra has been well-documented, this is the first time claims of abuse have been made from the north of the country. </p> <p>Two statements have been taken from Iraqis detained in Mosul and more are expected. </p> <p>In one, an Iraqi lawyer says he was hooded and stripped naked in a building known as the \"disco\". </p> <p>Yasir Rubaii Saeed al-Qutaji describes how loud western music was played and cold water poured over his body; he said he was also threatened with sexual abuse. </p> <p>\"For the next 15 hours they tried to break me down by taking me frequently inside and repeating the stripping, cold water and loud music sequence,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Due to the very loud music,\" he adds, \"they would talk to me via a loudspeaker that was placed next to my ears.\" </p> <p>The beatings did not leave a mark on his body because his attackers wore special gloves, he says. </p> <p>Mr al-Qutaji says he was a founder member of the Islamic Organisation for Human Rights. He claims that other prisoners were treated even worse. \"Some were burnt with fire, others [had] bandaged broken arms.\" </p> <p>In a separate statement, Haitham Saeed al-Mallah, a Mosul-born engineering graduate, says his house was raided by seven American soldiers in January. \"I was handcuffed and hooded and was then taken to an unknown place which they call 'the disco', where they played very loud music as one of their means of torture.\" </p> <p>He adds: \"They left me standing for hours, handcuffed and hooded, which made me quite disorientated. Then I was kicked very hard on my stomach, which was fol lowed by continuous beating with a stick and with their boots until I fell unconscious. I only woke up after they poured over my head very cold water, which caused me great suffering.\" </p> <p>Mr al-Mallah says he was taken to a room where there was a \"group torture\". </p> <p>He adds: \"I heard nothing but screaming and suffering of detained Iraqis. The usage of cold water along with beating seemed to be a standard procedure. We were then asked to perform exhausting exercises of squatting while they were playing extremely loud (and dirty) music. </p> <p>\"Whoever fell to the ground out of exhaustion would receive painful beating and cold water. We were prevented from going to the toilets despite our pleas, which made many of us soil ourselves.\" </p> <p>He says detainees were allowed to sleep for about two hours, after which the cycle of torture continued. </p> <p>\"The new thing this time was ordering us to shout, 'Long live the United States'. We were also made to shout obscenities (sentences that had the word 'fuck' in them).\" </p> <p>Mr al-Mallah says the next day, he saw \"a young man of 14 years of age bleeding from his anus and lying on the floor. </p> <p>\"He was Kurdish and his name was Hama. I heard the soldiers talking to each other about this guy, they mentioned that the reason for this bleeding was inserting a metal object in his anus.\" </p> <p>Mr al-Qutaji, who was detained in March, says he and other Iraqi lawyers have been unable to stop abuses because US forces have been given immunity from prosecution. </p> <p>He says Paul Bremer, former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, dismissed 120 of Iraq's senior judges, 45 of them in Mosul, on the grounds that they were supporters of Saddam's regime. </p> <p>Phil Shiner, of the Birmingham-based law firm Public Interest Lawyers, is trying to get the cases raised in the British courts. He is working with American lawyers to get them raised there. </p> <p>\"The British public needs to know the full implications of the decision to get into this war,\" he said. </p> <p>A US army spokesman in Baghdad said yesterday that he was surprised by the allegations, which would be investigated. </p> <p>The MoD in London said it had not yet been made aware of the allegations. </p>",
  "<p>So, I am at Santa Pod Raceway in Northamptonshire, behind the wheel of a Top Methanol category dragster. And not just any old Top Methanol dragster: the American Car Imports dragster, normally driven by the newly crowned European champion, Dave \"Grumpy\" Wilson. But Grumpy has gamely stood aside for a couple of minutes to let me have a go. And, as I have astutely observed, within seconds of sliding into the cockpit, the American Car Imports dragster differs from the car I normally drive in a number of key areas.</p> <p>For one thing, the bonnet is 25ft long, and held merely 3in off the ground by what is in effect a pair of pram wheels. Also, intensive stickering reveals the dragster to be sponsored by, among others, PlayStation 2, whose cash-rich backing for my own, private driving, I have never quite managed to secure. And, unlike in my car, the engine, mounted hard behind the driver's head, and keeping the fat rear wheels apart, has eight cylinders, generates in excess of 3,500bhp and is only marginally smaller than a three-bedroom bungalow.</p> <p>Sometimes, under acceleration, it burns so much fuel so quickly that there isn't room for all the combustion to take place inside the engine. Thus some of the fuel leaps out and does its burning in a startlingly orange halo around the back end. At which point, the dragster appears to be emerging from a ball of fire. Again, this isn't really in the repertoire of the car I drive at home. I did once have a Peugeot 205 which did something similar towards the end of longer journeys, but I decided to get rid of it. </p> <p>Something else the dragster does which my car doesn't: it routinely reaches speeds in excess of 250mph in under five seconds. That's quite fast. It's not the fastest-accelerating race car in the world: that's the Top Fuel dragster, which looks exactly the same as the Methanol dragster, but runs on nitro and would hope to reach over 300mph in that time. </p> <p>But that's just silly. You've got to ask yourself: do you really need to go that fast? Surely, 250mph is enough for any normal person's everyday needs. </p> <p>A Top Methanol dragster would leave Michael Schumacher's Ferrari chewing on its dust. Then again, Schumacher's Ferrari can go round corners, and that's not something that dragsters are entirely comfortable with. Just as problems with staircases hampered the Daleks, so an inability to do bends has prevented the dragster from achieving global domination. </p> <p>Other performance aspects of the dragster that might cause concern for the private owner: the fact that you need to strip the engine after every quarter-of-a-mile run; the consumption figures (see adjacent box); and the need for parachutes in the deceleration phase. I don't know what kind of a driveway you've got, but that would certainly be a problem on ours. </p> <p>Anyway, let's start her up, shall we? I pull on the health and safety headphones, exchange a firm-jawed thumbs-up with Grumpy, and the pit crew fire the engine. The sensation is immediate, visceral and terrifying. The noise is two parts jet plane to seven parts Mot\u00f6rhead, with a sweet top note of pneumatic drill. The fumes are yellow and the consistency of tarpaulin; within seconds, they fill my eyes, causing me to weep copious tears. </p> <p>I've got my foot flat on the clutch, but the engine is fighting it, kicking back, trying to get away. The vibrations shake my chest and threaten briefly to liquidise several of my most cherished internal organs. But it doesn't last long. Two minutes or so later, the stationary engine check on blocks in the pit is completed, the engine is shut down, and I get out. </p> <p>You weren't expecting me to drive the thing, were you? We looked into it, but a) the insurance would have been prohibitive, and b) I would have killed people, starting with myself. That's as suming I didn't stall on the line, which, actually, was the most likely outcome. Holding one of these machines at the biting point requires the nerve of a fighter pilot and the legs of a boxer. </p> <p>I left the driving to Wilson. He's the European champion, after all. He's also 60 years old, so he's had time to build the necessary muscles and hone the required reflexes. The team director, Anthony Cohen, who owns American Car Imports - Britain's leading purveyor of top-spec American cars to Premiership footballers and anyone else who can afford them - told me that when he stood behind Wilson on the start-line, he felt like he was sending a man to the moon. </p> <p>I asked Wilson what went through his mind when he was nailing his dragster up the strip, but he pointed out that there wasn't much time for the mind to get involved. When it worked, it was simply \"a blast\" - the fastest five seconds of a man's life. </p> <p>Later, Wilson took the dragster out on to the track for real, for the final meeting of the European Championships, tearing up the strip in a deafening howl, for the pleasure of several thousand whooping petrolheads. He won the event, of course, managing 255.34mph in a time of 5.457 seconds. I couldn't have done better myself.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Mark Borkowski</strong><br>PR expert</p> <p>Prince Harry's official 20th-birthday photograph is the tried-and-tested, safe PR route favoured by the royal family and, in particular, Kensington Palace: arty, clever, moody pictures selling the happy Wales household. The basic problem is that Harry and William hate the media and what they did to their mother. But what the press office is telling them is that they have to find some way of having a dialogue with the beast they loathe. What we are witnessing here is the swans gliding over the water; underneath there is an ugly set of feet, swimming like crazy to create a perfect PR moment.</p> <p>What it tries to sell is a harmonious picture of Buckingham Palace at ease with the media. But it doesn't show that there will always be tectonic plates shifting. The two princes, in particular William, will inevitably make some sort of mistake for the media to feed off. More than anything, this picture shows the symbiotic need of both parties.</p> <p><strong> Jonathan Jones</strong><br>Guardian art writer<br></p> <p>Mario Testino's photograph is not art. It isn't even a particularly good family snapshot. It lacks the innocent clumsiness of pictures any one of us might take, yet fails to replace this with the greater acuity of an art photograph. In fact, it makes the relationship between Charles and his sons look phony.</p> <p>The first false note is struck by the choice of black and white, which no one uses unless they want to suggest deep aesthetic and emotional perceptions. By removing the distraction of colour you can sharpen presence - think of Helmut Newton's sado-masochist portrait of Margaret Thatcher. But in Testino's picture there is a lack of fit between monochrome severity and the \"lighthearted\" pose. Worse, the picture is soft and misty. This is the opposite of what black and white is for. </p> <p>This picture's worthlessness finally lies in its complete lack of emotional plausibility. Relationships between fathers and sons are never as simple as this. With a family history as tangled as that of Charles and his late wife, there must be undercurrents. A convincing portrait of the Windsors would require the services not of Mario Testino but David Chase, creator of The Sopranos. </p> <p><strong> Jennie Bond</strong><br>Former royal correspondent </p> <p>I think it is very unusual as a royal portrait, particularly as the main character is not even facing the camera. It certainly shows Charles at his most relaxed, which he is with the boys. What strikes me most is the prominence of the Windsor nose in all three, which at least confirms their blood ties. I like the picture because you just think, what can be so funny? What is that Testino has just said or done to make them laugh so much? It looks like a really natural giggle from Harry. It shows him as the lad he is: quite immature, prone to bursts of girlish giggling, no doubt often induced by the booze he's probably got stashed just out of his father's sight. In fact, he is surprisingly normal for a prince. I think it is a lovely photo that captures the real affection and strong relationship between all three of them. </p> <p><strong>Eamonn McCabe</strong><br>Guardian photographer</p> <p>Good to see that Mario Testino has found some work shooting Christmas cards, a good little earner at this time of year when things are quiet, even for the world's most famous fashion photographer (or so his website says).</p> <p>One of the first rules of shooting a portrait is that you should be able to see the face of the sitter, but then, this is a reject shot from the Christmas-card shoot, so let's not be too critical: two out of three faces ain't bad. But what is that pineapple doing coming out of Charles's left ear?</p> <p><strong>Jess Cartner-Morley</strong><br>Guardian fashion editor </p> <p>Prince Charles is having what fashion people call \"a moment\". Last week, the very dapper pop star Andre 3000, almost certainly the only man ever to wear plus-fours on MTV, cited the Prince of Wales as his fashion icon. And now here he is looking really rather handsome - no mean feat when sitting next to the beautiful Prince William.</p> <p>In earlier portraits, Charles was dressed differently from his sons to represent his seniority; here, they are all in identical white shirts to emphasise the fact that they are now all adults. All boys together, is the message from the pose. The only wrong note is the western-style belt Charles is wearing, which is horribly like something from George Bush's weekend wardrobe.</p> <p>But what is most striking about this picture is the resemblance to one of Testino's most famous portraits of Princess Diana, when she is wearing an open-necked white shirt and smiling. If you look at that picture next to William in this picture, the similarity is quite extraordinary. This is a reference that Testino would certainly have seen when he was setting the picture up. The effect is to make it seem almost as if Diana is there, too.</p>",
  "<p>Recently floated advertising group M&amp;C Saatchi said today that consolidation in the industry was a good thing for independent agencies as they could offer clients a distinctive service.</p> <p>Chief executive David Kershaw said WPP's acquisition yesterday of the world's leading independent agency, Grey Global, posed no threat to smaller companies.</p> <p>\"We are delighted with it. The more consolidation there is the less choice there is for clients to go to independent agencies. We can only benefit as people get gobbled up.\"</p> <p>Asked if consolidation would one day affect M&amp;C Saatchi - whose founding directors between them control the company with stakes locked in for two years - Mr Kershaw said: \"We are very happy swimming along. We do not see ourselves as potential gobblees.\"</p> <p>\"I think there's room for us [to grow]. As [smaller companies] flourish, the gobblers tend to do what they do.\"</p> <p>He said the company's smaller scale - it has a market capitalisation of \u00a373m compared with WPP's \u00a35.9bn - meant there was no inconsistency between its operations.</p> <p>\"Every office can be creatively excellent, can be profitable... there's a real market position to be had and I can't see any fundamental economic benefits to being part of a consolidated group.</p> <p>\"There's no reason why independent agencies can't operate with the same margins as consolidated groups.\"</p> <p>M&amp;C Saatchi's reinvention as a small outfit with just 14 offices round the world is a far cry from its directors' former home, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, an advertising behemoth that rose in the 1970s and 80s to become the world's biggest.</p> <p>And whereas Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's went on a bumper acquisition spree - until an acrimonious break-up in 1995 that saw the agency absorbed into French group Publicis and the Saatchi brothers breaking away to found M&amp;C Saatchi - its successor's strategy is to pursue start-ups and grow businesses organically.</p> <p>In July this year the company decided on a flotation to raise funds for an expansion into continental Europe.</p> <p>Today the company announced its first interim results as a public company, reporting pre-tax profit of \u00a34m in the first half of the year, up 8.8% on a year earlier.</p> <p>Revenues - about 60% of which comes from the UK - were up 10% between January and June, to \u00a329.8m.</p> <p>The company is focusing on expanding its offices, with two major European offices due to be opened in 2005 and a parallel project to open more Asian bureaux under way.</p> <p>Mr Kershaw said that between two-thirds and three-quarters of the \u00a37.5m raised from the company's flotation would be sued to spearhead the push into Europe. </p> <p>The new offices in Asia - where M&amp;C Saatchi already has seven bases - will be smaller and less \"capital-hungry\" than their European counterparts, Mr Kershaw said.</p> <p>The company has started to recruit local talent in Europe and plans to incentivise staff by giving them a 20% stake in the local agencies.</p> <p>Shares in the company rose by 1.9% this morning to 134p, valuing the company at \u00a372.6m.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q</strong> I've been living and working in London for the last six years in digital marketing. I now find that I'm a bit of an expert but in a very specialised field which ties me to London. I'm working for the best company in my field so there's no other company I'd like to work for, but I find it very unrewarding working in an office environment being tied to my desk. </p> <p>What's more, I'm really bored of the London lifestyle which is why I bought a house by the seaside earlier this year. This way I have a retreat at the weekends and by renting out the spare rooms I have my mortgage covered by rent money. The problem is that I'm finding living in London during the week harder and harder as I'd much prefer to be in my lovely house and not in my rented flat in the City.</p> <p>The ideal I guess in the short-term would be to have a couple of days per week working from home, but I don't think my boss would allow it. In terms of overall direction, I always thought I'd work in government, I spent five years studying it and current affairs/social policy is where I'd like to be, but I've got no idea if I could switch at my grand old age of 29.</p> <p> <strong>A</strong> Your presentation begs the question that if you are keen to work in government and have spent five years studying politics, what are you doing in digital marketing? </p> <p>That said , you are not alone in re-evaluating your options and life-style. Dr Johnson's view that when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life doesn't really hold these days, with its expensive and barely reliable transport system, daily car tax and sky-high property prices. Nevertheless there are many people who would envy your situation of living and working in London and also owning a decent weekend retreat. </p> <p>As your current employer is reluctant to let you work from your home by the sea, I would capitalise on your knowledge and expertise in digital marketing and consider taking the plunge into the world of self-employment, perhaps as an independent, freelance marketing consultant. </p> <p>This will give you the chance to live by the sea and save your rent money on the London flat. But tread carefully! Do not give up your current job yet; use your spare time to research the different options of becoming self-employed.

  "<p>Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers.</p> <p>Also in today's Wrap: Kremlin tightens grip, Blair speaks to TUC conference, and Spanish police halt 'Cannonball Run Europe'</p> <p><strong>BATMAN PROTESTER BREACHES PALACE SECURITY</strong></p> <p>\"Holey security, batman!\" The Sun takes the laurels for the most succinctly witty response to the news that a man dressed as Batman yesterday appeared on a ledge at Buckingham Palace, making a protest for Fathers for Justice. The group, which says fathers get a poor deal when couples split up, has previously exposed security failings at the House of Commons by throwing purple powder at the prime minister (or perhaps the chancellor - you never know these days).</p> <p>Most of the other papers circle around what, in hindsight, is the obvious joke. The Times manages \"Holy breach of security,\" and the Mirror has \"Batma'am\" - but the Mail and Express are bursting veins with rage. What, asks the Mail, if it had been al-Qaida? What, asks the Express, if it had been a suicide bomber? The Express gives Fathers for Justice the traditional media treatment of superheroes, describing them as \"a public menace\", but the Mail finds room for a sympathetic word, running a piece by a female writer on what motivates them. </p> <p>The Guardian helpfully provides a graphic of how the man got on to the ledge which, incidentally, shows how quickly police reacted: they had nabbed Batman's accomplice (Robin, since you ask) before he got into the palace grounds.</p> <p>Oddly, the most entertaining and reflective commentary is to be found buried at the end of the FT's Notebook column. \"The fabulous image of a chubby Batman waving to the crowds,\" it says, perhaps shows that Palace guards \"were only looking out for people dressed as Osama bin Laden ... We should at least be thankful that al-Qaida lacks the logistical capabilities of a bunch of disgruntled dads in superhero costumes, otherwise there would be precious little of London left standing.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/monarchy/story/0,2763,1304115,00.html\">Protesters breach royal security</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004423137,00.html\">Sun: Holey security Batman!</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/42b0114c-05ed-11d9-bff2-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Father of terror</a></p> <p><strong>PUTIN TIGHTENS GRIP</strong> </p> <p>\"President Vladimir Putin yesterday took a chainsaw to the fragile roots of Russian democracy,\" says the FT in an impassioned leader in response to Mr Putin's proposed sweeping overhaul of the country's political system. </p> <p>The changes, which will give the Kremlin greater power than at any time since the fall of the Soviet Union, are \"simply exploiting the Beslan massacre to seize new powers for the Kremlin,\" the paper continues, warning that \"fear of the Kremlin stalks the streets once more\". Under the proposals, the country's 89 regional governors would be nominated by the president, bringing an end to regional elections, and seats in the Duma would be brought under fully proportional system - a move that would give Mr Putin's party, United Russia, even greater control. </p> <p>A \"return to the USSR\" is the consensus of the leader writers - for the Telegraph, the reforms \"are the depressingly predictable reactions of a man who came to power as the strongman of Chechnya and is using the latest terrorist outrage to boost the Kremlin's already formidable authority\". The Herald Tribune remarks that \"across the short spectrum of political opposition in today's Russia, reactions ranged from stunned disbelief to helpless anger\".</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,1303957,00.html\">Putin tightens grip on regions and MPs</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/2a5a43ee-05eb-11d9-bff2-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Putin power</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/09/14/dl1402.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/14/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: More power to Putin</a></p> <p><strong>BLAIR GIVES 'LUKEWARM' SPEECH TO TUC</strong></p> <p>One can feel the agony of the sketchwriters today. After Tony Blair's speech to the TUC conference yesterday was built up as the first salvo in the Labour party's civil war, it turned out to be neither combative enough to be an attack nor sufficiently badly received to be considered a mauling. Indeed, it is largely pushed off the front pages by the antics of our chubby superhero.</p> <p>In the Times, Ann Treneman - who spends one fifth of her sketch discussing the Brighton weather - concentrates on Mr Blair's delivery. \"His introduction was extraordinary, but in the wrong way, for it was as flat as you can get. It did not even make it to pancake levels ... Towards the end, when he should have been building up to a barnstormer of an ending, Mr Blair managed to become even more lukewarm. 'To people at work, wondering whether membership of a trade union has anything to offer them, I would say: go and see'.\"</p> <p>Simon Hoggart in the Guardian is in similar straits, but is watching the reception. \"It wasn't aggressive silence, a collective dumb insolence. Neither was it hostile, like the Tory front bench or the women's institute. It was just - silence.\"</p> <p>But the flavour of the event (and it seems there was little enough) is perhaps best captured by Andrew Gimson in the Telegraph, who compares Mr Blair to a successful man being obliged to visit unfashionable relatives. \"Frankly,\" he says, \"it is a relief to both sides when these painful encounters are over.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardianpolitics/story/0,,1303985,00.html\">All quiet on the union front</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1261240,00.html\">Times: Off-colour Tony fails to warm the comrades</a></p> <p><strong>CLARKE PLANS UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS SHAKE-UP</strong></p> <p>Deprived of their battle in Brighton, the papers look elsewhere. The Telegraph reports plans by the education secretary, Charles Clarke, to change the university admissions procedure so it happens after students receive their A-level results and not, as is currently the case, before. Mr Clarke describes \"post qualification application\" - PQA - as a \"holy grail\" which has always been seen as desirable, but not achievable. An analysis piece says the changes will also include changes to favour applicants from poorer backgrounds. </p> <p>A leader in the Times mostly applauds the former idea, but laments the latter. It says there is a failure \"to take account of the longer-term consequences of 'positive discrimination',\" adding: \"Mr Clarke's true holy grail should be to eliminate the need for it.\" </p> <p>The Independent runs one of its bullet-point front pages, assessing the prime minister's environmental record ahead of a speech today, in which it says he will demand that the US ratify the Kyoto treaty.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/14/nedu14.xml\">Telegraph: Radical shake-up in entry to college</a></p> <p>* <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/environment/story.jsp?story=561463\">Independent: How green is our PM?</a></p> <p><strong>'I WANTED TO BE INVISIBLE'</strong></p> <p>\"Helicopters were firing at us.

  "<p>Never in the history of higher education has the funding of students and universities been such a complex and exciting political issue. The Labour government has just managed, by the skin of its teeth, to introduce the new Higher Education Act and a substantial increase in fees is on the way from 2006. Exactly the sort of imaginative proposal that a Conservative government might have pursued in the 1990s.</p> <p>As Labour captured the high ground, it seemed impossible for the Tories to find a credible policy that had even a glimmer of a chance of being both electorally attractive and financially sound. A simple headline of \"no fees\" might win a few friends but would leave the tricky issue of where the money is going to come from. No one believes the Liberal Democrat answer of \"the nice taxpayer will be happy to pay more to put middle-class kids through university\".</p> <p>We now have the proposals from the Conservatives on future funding for students and universities and they have done an excellent job of extracting themselves from an almost impossible political position. They have abolished fees, cut bureaucracy, slain a few unpopular dragons such as the Office of Fair Access and come up with proposals that address the funding needs of universities. The circle is well and truly squared, absolutely brilliant and actually credible.</p> <p>The headline is that if you vote Tory, student fees will be abolished; if you vote Labour, student fees rise to \u00a33,000 from 2006. That is the message voters will hear in the general election. All else is froth and detail. It might be important, but there are no votes in the esoterics of interest rates on student loans and not a single marginal constituency will swing on the question of whether the Student Loan Book should transfer to a charity from the Treasury.</p> <p>Aspects of the Conservatives' proposals will cause universities unease. In cutting bureaucracy they have replaced the funding council's detailed central control of student numbers with a National Scholarship scheme, where money follows students. Vouchers by another name. This is a good idea. For too long universities have dominated the higher education market place. They have controlled and regulated demand, and the student is weakened by being more of a supplicant than an applicant. Anything, such as a National Scholarship scheme, that places demand in the hands of the students, as consumers, should be welcomed.</p> <p>The proposals acknowledge that there is no such thing as a free market, so the National Scholarship scheme will still interfere to ensure that we get enough teachers, nurses, engineers, and perhaps even chemists, and no doubt fewer specialists in golf-course management. And while market demand can be a hard taskmaster, it is always a better discipline than the formulaic and protectionist approach that we operate today. The Conservative vision of freeing up the universities from the burden of regulation is well argued and should be universally welcomed. To be fair, it is probably not that different from the objectives Labour might like to achieve, but is never able to deliver.</p> <p>So how have the Conservatives managed to achieve this three-card trick of making everyone happy without putting up taxes? The money comes from two sources. First, students will have to repay their loans at a real rate of interest. While this is a bit of a downer, it is the correct approach. The big source of extra money is the transfer of the Student Loan Book. This is, of course, taking it off the taxpayer, but in a way that will never be noticed. You will not get questions from voters on the doorsteps in Hodge Hill on the transfer of the Loan Book. It's still public money, but as you never knew you had it, you are not going to miss it.</p> <p>So, overall, how good are the Conservative proposals for higher education? Given the position from which they started, their policy is much better than I would ever have expected. It will be electorally popular, solves the funding crisis in universities and nods its head in passing to the traditional Tory belief in the strength of the market place. It's still got too many rough edges to merit a first, but I would certainly give it a very good upper second.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Dr Peter Knight is vice-chancellor of the University of Central England</p>",
  "<p>Sony's acquisition of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is, in a sense, a historic moment for Hollywood, as the last studio not to belong to a media conglomerate joins Sony's electronics-to-music portfolio. But it will probably make little difference to filmgoers. </p> <p>The two principal, and related, effects of the sale will be to give Sony access to MGM's back catalogue, and to open up MGM's library to cable television distribution, as part of the related agreement with Comcast, a US cable network. </p> <p>MGM films already in production will almost certainly go ahead as planned. These include a Get Shorty sequel, Be Cool, starring John Travolta, and a new Pink Panther film starring Steve Martin. Beyond that it is unclear what will happen. The studio may keep on the MGM label, or its United Artists imprint, as separate brands, to be to Sony what Miramax is to Disney. This is possibly more likely to happen with United, which has a certain \"indy\" cachet, but omens for MGM staff are mixed. Sony previously waited nearly 10 years before deciding to merge two of its studios, Columbia and Tristar.</p> <p>Nor will James Bond, as the Times had it this morning, necessarily \"fall into Japanese hands\"; the Broccoli family has always kept a tight rein on the Bond rights, and separate negotiations are expected over the 007 franchise.</p> <p>What's absolutely certain is that Sony's intentions in exploiting the MGM franchises and back catalogues will be exactly the same as those of MGM: namely to make as much money as possible out of them. In practice, Sony may be able to spend more on making the films, both because of its easier access to funds, and because it will now see more avenues for exploitation through the cable and on-demand video channels it hopes to set up with Comcast. Whether spending more on the films will improve their quality is a moot point.</p> <p>One possible point of interest in the deal - which has to be approved by US regulators - is the increasing tendency for the major studios to share interests in broadcasting and video games. Studios increasingly look to cable and DVD distribution as important sources of revenue alongside box office sales. </p> <p>It is possible to see MGM's demise as being part of the broad sweep of history; its greatest years were in the 1930s, when it \"owned\" several of the biggest stars - Greta Garbo, Spencer Tracy - and operated a chain of cinemas. After 1940 studio control over cinema houses was curtailed, and the system whereby stars worked mostly for one studio also began to decline. </p> <p>MGM was really starting to fade by 1985, just when Rupert Murdoch acquired Twentieth Century Fox. Since then, broadcast and other revenue channels have become increasingly important for studios, and neither Sony nor MGM has really exploited this. Sony's agreement with Comcast goes someway to remedying the two studios' weakness. You could see it as the last step in the transition from studio dependence on cinema exhibition to a new partnership with home exhibition, with unforeseeable consequences for film-making.</p> <p>If Sony does decide to do away with the MGM label, many will be sorry at the demise of the studio that brought us Ben-Hur, James Bond and the Wizard of Oz. It will be sad, indeed, no longer to see the MGM lion roaring as the lights go down. But studios have been combining or disappearing for as long as there have been cinemas, and we should not forget that DreamWorks, now a major player, was only founded in 1994. Who knows what new lions may yet be born?</p>",
  "<p>The chief constable of Humberside was welcomed back to work yesterday by colleagues and people who had denounced his suspension after the Soham murders. </p> <p>David Westwood was applauded, saluted and given a peck on the cheek by his secretary as he returned to force headquarters in Hull for the first time in 10 weeks. </p> <p>The chairman of the local police authority, Colin Inglis, symbolically handed him back his official warrant, shook his hand warmly and praised the moment as \"a reaffirmation of local accountability.\" </p> <p>Others echoed the snub to the home secretary, David Blunkett, who was widely accused on Humberside of trying to make Mr Westwood a scapegoat for wider failings in the Home Office and police handling of information on criminal suspects such as the Soham double murderer Ian Huntley. </p> <p>Mr Westwood stood by an agreement with Mr Blunkett to make no substantive public comment, as part of a deal which ended his suspension but will see him take early retirement at the end of March. </p> <p>He made it clear that his brief remaining tenure would see work done on meeting deficiencies - especially in handling intelligence - in time for January when a government inquiry into the Soham lapses headed by Sir Michael Bichard reconvenes to hear what improvements have been made. </p> <p>Mr Westwood said: \"When Sir Michael asks all parties to account for what they've done, I shall be there to show what Humberside police has completed. As you know, the home secretary and I have an agreement that neither of us will be making press comments so that is all that I will be saying.\" </p> <p>Mr Westwood and his force were severely criticised in the Bichard report, but Humberside police authority fought to the wire against Mr Blunkett's decision to suspend the chief constable. </p> <p>Mr Inglis, who is also leader of Hull city council, repeatedly said that Mr Westwood, who was not in charge at the time of some of the lapses over Huntley, was the best person to overhaul procedures in the force. </p> <p>Humberside police had eight contacts with Huntley between 1995 and 1998 when the killer of the schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells was living in north-east Lincolnshire. </p> <p>Four involved rape claims but these were not pursued by the alleged victims, and misinterpretation of data protection law by the police meant that none figured in a check on Huntley when he applied to be school caretaker at Soham. </p> <p>Huntley, 30, was sentenced to life imprisonment last December for murdering the 10-year-old girls in August 2002.</p>",
  "<p>The morning after the start of the war in Iraq, breakfast club at Shacklewell primary was a sombre affair. The 20 or so children who take up the offer of a nearly-free breakfast each morning had things on their minds. In between mouthfuls of brown toast, cereals and organic milk, the children started to ask questions.</p> <p>\"They were worried,\" says learning mentor Samantha Hunt. \"They wanted to know why the war was happening and if it would come here. We had a discussion about the reasons behind it and their concerns, and I was able to reassure them and make them feel more secure.\"</p> <p>That morning, more than a year ago now, neatly encapsulates the ethos at the east London school where their \"healthy school\" status is taken to comprise both the physical and the emotional well-being of their pupils. As shafts of early sunlight filtered into the dining hall, the youngsters at this inner-city school fed both their bodies and their minds.</p> <p>It was to this Hackney school that Charles Clarke, the education secretary, and John Reid, the health secretary, came last week to launch the government's Healthy Living Blueprint for Schools. The 25-page booklet is designed to encourage schools to approach the question of the health of their pupils in a holistic manner, using every aspect of school life from playtime to meal times, sports lessons to science lessons to enforce the healthy lifestyle message. Reid said the school \"seemed to represent everything we are trying to pull together in the guidance\".</p> <p>Reid added: \"This isn't just about healthy eating. It's about teaching children, in interesting ways, many of them practical, about the benefits of healthy living. It's about offering them options other than the traditional chicken and chips, and it's about incorporating active play and sports into their lifestyles.\"</p> <p>When headteacher Darra McFadyen came to Shacklewell two years ago, she began putting health and well-being at the centre of the curriculum. The school has taken the catering in-house, giving it more control over the menus, and there is at least one salad on the menu every day. The bread served is wholemeal, the vegetables are freshly prepared that day and there is always a vegetarian option. There are no fizzy drinks on offer. Chips are offered no more than once a week and all children are given a free piece of fruit at break time. Despite the potential for supplementary income, the school refuses to countenance the presence of vending machines.</p> <p>For her part, McFadyen was pleased to be recognised. But she has concerns, too, about this latest initiative, lamenting the lack of emphasis on partnerships to promote healthy schools.</p> <p>\"This blueprint just arrived in the post one day, without any warning,\" she says. \"We know schools have a huge part to play, but we can't do it alone. There needs to be parental involvement and support from other agencies. In a sense, there have been so many initiatives around healthy schools - we got our healthy school status when the government introduced their last initiative three years ago - and this does feel a bit like just another one. There's not much practical advice, and I do wonder what school doesn't do their best in all these areas anyway.</p> <p>\"We are doing all these things already, but I suppose it's nice for it to be acknowledged and to know that we're on the right lines.\"</p> <p>At Shacklewell most children have at least 15 minutes of physical education each day. The plan is for this to be extended. In the playground, youngsters have an area with climbing frames, slides and swings where they can burn off energy and there are plans to build a dedicated sports area later this year.</p> <p>Children are also encouraged to learn more about the natural world around them as a way of keeping them active, but also encouraging awareness about where their food comes from.</p> <p>There is a wildlife trail and an organic flowerbed in the playground, while at the back of the school there is a terraced vegetable patch. Here, with the help of a parents' group called the Gardeners of Shacklewell, children learn to get closer to their food. Tomatoes, beans, rhubarb, potatoes, lettuces, carrots and fruits are grown seasonally, while back in the classrooms, the processes of germination and growth and the nutritional value of the produce are dissected during science classes. Once the garden becomes more established there are plans for the produce to be used by the school kitchen.</p> <p>\"We try to incorporate everything into being healthy,\" says McFadyen. \"It's about moving away from a reliance on processed foods, encouraging activity and looking at emotional wellbeing. It's a whole curriculum approach.\"</p> <p>In addition, she says, there is a hugely important area that is almost entirely missed by the blueprint: the children's emotional health. Nowhere is this more important, says McFadyen, than at a school like Shacklewell.</p> <p>\"The high mobility of our children is one of our most challenging issues,\" she says. \"Two-thirds of our 413 pupils speak English as an additional language. Some will have been through trauma. We have children from the Congo, from the Middle East, from places where they will have experienced real hardship. As a result, we have behavioural issues that need to be addressed to maintain a healthy school. This is touched on in the blueprint, but I would have liked to have seen a lot more about the whole package of inclusion and addressing the issues of children from those really hard to reach families.\"</p> <p>Shacklewell is also situated in one of the most deprived areas of the country. All the issues so often attendant on poverty - child protection, behavioural problems, health problems and emotional difficulties - are seen at the school. Shacklewell's approach is to talk.</p> <p>\"Emotional literacy is a huge part of our curriculum,\" says McFadyen. \"We try to get the children to recognise their own emotions and those of others, helping them to control their emotions. Once a week, we have circle time where children sit in a circle and discuss issues that are important to them and we have a golden time where they can do activities that they want to do. We make sure there is a lot of communication.\"</p> <p>Arron, 10, is a pupil who admits he has had problems with his behaviour. \"I went to a circle group,\" he says. \"We did a laughing game there where we had to make someone laugh, but not laugh ourselves. It was to help us not get distracted in class. The circle group also helped my self-confidence so I'm not scared of moving on to secondary school.\"</p> <p>Yilmaz, 10, from Turkey, explains another innovation to help children feel at home. \"There is a peer support group,\" he says. \"When a new child arrives at school there are four people who have to help them settle in and support them. It's to stop people getting lonely.\"</p>",
  "<p>Extended schools are a key part of the government's attempt to improve educational standards while offering new services beyond the curriculum. Social work and youth counselling services will be brought under one roof. The aim is worthy: to combine the development of schools and the renewal of the communities they serve.</p> <p>There are now 106 official extended schools, but hundreds more engage in similar activities across the country: additional activities range from childcare, to after-school clubs, to medical and social services. By 2006 there will be one in every local education authority, and the government envisages that eventually every school will provide extended services.</p> <p>But the extended school model contains a built-in paradox. Schools could become victims of their own success in one of two ways: by becoming over-extended, or not extending enough. Schools that become community hubs, drawing on the resources and knowledge of their community - including parents - are likely to become more academically successful and in time will be colonised by the middle classes. The school's league-table position may improve, but its impact on the immediate community may diminish. In short, they won't be extended enough.</p> <p>Alternatively, an extended school that develops expertise in working with disadvantaged pupils will skew its intake in that direction. The school will be swamped by problems that have previously been dealt with outside school. Success in extending its work with children into social work and youth support services is likely to be appreciated by the local authority. But those middle-class parents may feel the offer of, say, pregnancy advisory services less attractive and take their children elsewhere. The school has just become a victim of over-extension.</p> <p>Headteachers of extended schools will have to balance the needs of the school and its pupils with the aspirations of parents and their community. While these do not necessarily conflict, they may not always coincide either. Extended schools will need to find ways to manage their intake while convincing parents - particularly the motivated middle-class ones who will vote with their children's feet - that it is possible to offer a good education and deal with social problems under one roof.</p> <p>Headteachers will be well aware of the risks in throwing open their doors to disadvantaged communities. Today, many schools already undersell their success in working with transient families, difficult teenagers and those with special needs. Their fear is that their success will simply draw in more such pupils, overpowering their capacity to cope. This is precisely the risk that extended schools face. With youth workers, social workers and youth offending teams onsite, they could quickly become sink schools by design.</p> <p>As the number of extended schools increases, this paradox will become increasingly threatening.</p> <p>So how will headteachers avoid becoming over-extended? They will try to strike a balance, and they will do so by regulating their intake. We are already seeing a few of the tricks. A secondary school that offers French classes to those about to leave local primary schools, perhaps learning alongside their parents, is offering a valued service. The school can tick the box of community provision, while cleverly marketing itself to the kind of parents who holiday in Provence.</p> <p>In education, to describe this kind of practice as selection by the back door is controversial, but from tightly worded home/school agreement to strict uniform enforcement, today this is an inescapable feature of a system that forces schools to find ways to manage their intake.</p> <p>We shouldn't blame the schools, while acknowledging that the extended school model makes these tricks more likely. Policy-makers must challenge the system that has set schools and communities in opposition.</p> <p>Demos visited a number of extended schools during its research. While most are doing good work, their headteachers need help from the education system as a whole. And they must find ways to convince middle-class parents to commit to the school, not through back-door selection but by demonstrating the value of rising to the community challenge.</p> <p>Extended schools must also be able to keep their most disadvantaged families on board and involve them in school life without resorting to the pressure of calling parents in for meetings, or asking them to sign home-school contracts. In both cases, schools need a greater ability to encourage this involvement, to show all parents that they have a stake in school life.</p> <p>One way to achieve this would be through \"voice vouchers\", which would give parents control over a small but significant portion of the school's budget. A single voucher would be worth just a few pounds, so that parents could make a difference only if they acted together, in the interests of all children, rather than in isolation in the interests of their own.</p> <p>Voice vouchers would transfer control of around 1% of a school's annual costs into the hands of parents, enabling them to decide how and where money was spent.</p> <p>With a typical secondary school annual budget in the region of \u00a33m, 1% equates to a figure of \u00a330,000. Although a relatively small amount, the spending power would be significant enough to encourage parents to work together and take a more active role in the education of their children.</p> <p>The initiative would be particularly beneficial for schools considering the switch to extended status, acting as an incentive for parents who currently have little motivation for engaging with schools beyond the initial decision of where to send their children.</p> <p>This is a modest but symbolically important proposal. It offers parents a practical way to support the school their children attend. And it could kick-start the kind of partnership between homes and schools on which learning thrives, and ensure that the theory of extended schools works in practice.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>John Craig is a researcher at Demos, the thinktank.

  "<p>Up to 10,000 people a month are dying of disease in the Darfur camps, many of them children, despite the international aid effort, the World Health Organisation said yesterday. </p> <p>A study in the west and north of the region by the WHO and the Sudanese government pointed to a monthly toll of 6,000-10,000 in the displaced population of 1.2 million. \"Thousands of these are children,\" David Nabarro, head of WHO's health crisis action group, told Reuters. </p> <p>\"These mortality figures are of considerable concern ... What is disturbing is that we are already six months into this crisis.\" </p> <p>The death rate was up to six times that of an African country without a humanitarian crisis. </p> <p>The figures were released as EU foreign ministers urged the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, to set up an international commission of inquiry into all violations of human rights in Darfur, including possible acts of genocide. </p> <p>The British and French ministers, Jack Straw and Michel Barnier, stopped short of following the US secretary of state Colin Powell in using the word \"genocide\" to describe the activities of the Janjaweed and other militias in Darfur. </p> <p>But Mr Straw said that whatever phrase was used - genocide, ethnic cleansing or civil war - a new UN security council resolution should urge Mr Annan to set up an urgent inquiry \"into all alleged human rights abuses, including allegations of genocide\". </p> <p>The EU ministers said there was \"no indication that the Sudanese government has taken real and verifiable steps to disarm and neutralise\" the militia, and urged it to bring to justice militia leaders or army officers suspected of serious human rights violations. </p> <p>Mr Straw said he was \"pretty confident\" that any new UN resolution would contain a renewed threat of sanctions. </p> <p>\"They will come much closer unless we see very much better cooperation on the crucial issue of law and order in Darfur,\" he said. </p> <p>The US is already pressing for sanctions. </p> <p>Mr Barnier said the EU could send a contingent of police officers to help the African Union mission in Darfur. </p> <p>France has already sent 200 soldiers to the neighbouring state of Chad, where there are an estimated two million refugees from Darfur, to help monitor the border. </p> <p>The WHO says that diarrhoea is the leading cause of death in Darfur, particularly of children, but violence is also a \"significant cause\". </p> <p>The interview-based survey did not go into the nature of the violence, Mr Nabarro said. </p> <p>\"You should not be seeing these sort of figures six months into an emergency, and they reflect the fact that we still have a huge humanitarian challenge ahead of us,\" he added. </p> <p>But the mortality rate was in line with the 50,000 dead which the UN and other international bodies have been using as the probable toll since the crisis erupted, Mr Nabarro said. </p> <p>The US has accused the Sudanese government of condoning genocide in Darfur by not halting Arab militia attacks on the African tribes which Khartoum suspects of supporting two rebel movements in the vast and arid region. </p> <p>The revolt began early last year after years of skirmishing between African farmers and Arab nomads contesting the right to land. </p> <p>The rebels accuse Khartoum of arming the Janjaweed to crush them and their civilian sympathisers, an accusation the government denies. </p> <p>The US administration is pressing for international sanctions against Khartoum and the EU said on Monday that it would impose sanctions if Sudan did not not take adequate steps to disarm the militias. </p> <p>Around a quarter of those surveyed in the camps said they had no access to safe drinking water and between a third and a half had no latrines, Mr Nabarro said. </p> <p>Insecurity and logistical problems brought on by the rainy season were hampering the relief effort, and the humanitarian agencies were also suffering a continued cash shortage. </p> <p>\"The fact is that our relief operation for a number of reasons is not doing the job,\" he said.</p>",
  "Employers and unions were at loggerheads yesterday after each accused the other of being locked in the past. <p>Roger Lyons, president of the TUC, kicked off the latest in a series of increasingly sharp exchanges by claiming that many of Britain's bosses were \"stuck in a time warp\", choosing to exploit flaws in labour market regulation rather than investing in skills and equipment. </p> <p>Then, after the TUC conference in Brighton had backed calls for the government to scrap anti-union legislation passed by the Tories, the CBI director general, Digby Jones, responded by describing the unions as looking for an industrial relations strategy \"in the dustbin of history\". </p> <p>The row has been heating up since Mr Jones described the unions as irrelevant in a recent speech to the Scottish CBI. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Lyons hit back at the \"irrelevant\" jibe, saying: \"Digby, you're completely out of touch if you believe workers are so well-off they don't need unions. Try telling that to the millions working over 60 hours a week, the longest hours in Europe.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The reality is that too many employers are behind the times, out of touch and putting the exploitation of the flexible under-regulated labour market before investment in skills and capital projects.\" </p> <p>Unions, said Mr Lyons, were playing a crucial role in defending workers' pensions, \"which are under attack almost everywhere except, of course, the boardroom, where promoting inequality is a major pastime\". </p> <p>The CBI was not the only target for union anger. Tony Woodley, general secretary of the Transport &amp; General Workers' Union, said it was \"incredible\" that after seven years of a Labour government the TUC should be demanding rights for workers enjoyed by everyone else in Europe. </p> <p>\"It can't be right that the law allows employers to employ scabs to undermine legitimate disputes, that trade unions can't even offer solidarity and support for their own members. That is why we are concerned at the failure of the government to repeal anti-union laws. </p> <p>\"We need the right to solidarity, the right to support each other, and we need employment rights from day one as well as the right to take lawful strike action without fear of getting the sack.\" </p> <p>The unions had reached an agreement with the government at Warwick over what needed to be done. \"We will stick to the agreement ... I call on ministers to do the same.\"</p>",
  "As ever, before the TUC speech, I'm not short of advice. The difference this year is that I agree with it. Some have told me not to break the agreement at the Warwick Policy Forum in July. Some, notably Brendan, have said it's time to come out in favour of social partnership, not be embarrassed about it. All have told me not to lose touch with the concerns of the hard-working families it's our and my duty to represent. <p>So I come here to praise Warwick not bury it. To advocate social partnership not belittle it. And above all to demonstrate that our and my priority is and always will be the lives, living standards and quality of life of Britain's hard-working families, the men and women who play by the rules and expect others to do the same; who worry about the bills and the mortgage and making ends meet; who struggle with the modern burden of work and family life, and don't ask for or expect miracles just a fair chance to make the most of life for them and their children.</p> <p>I frankly admit that too many people look at the past few years and see how the political and media agenda has been dominated by nothing but foreign affairs. Now there's all sorts of explanations I can give. The world agenda since September 11th 2001 has been different. Different for the leaders that have stood by America since then. Different for the leaders that haven't, but dominant for both.</p> <p>I can't apologise for what I think about the world since September 11th or what I have done in the war against this vicious terrorism we face. That would be insincere and dishonest.</p> <p>But vital though that war is, the daily lives of our citizens here in Britain are not about foreign affairs. It's interest rates, the workplace, taxes and bills, schools and hospitals, crime and ASB. Their stage is not the world; it's here on our streets, our towns, villages and cities.</p> <p>Yet even at the height of the crises of the last three years - since I stood here in this hall on 11 September and spoke about this new form of terrorism our world faces - we have never stopped working on that domestic, bread and butter, real life agenda.</p> <p>But I acknowledge it hasn't seemed like that. I have never been away from those issues that make daily life good or bad for our people. But too many people watching the news every night might think I have. And if I can put it like this: even if I've never been away, it's time to show I'm back. </p> <p>The best way of doing that is to prove it by action.</p> <p>Over the weekend I got out the first speech I ever made to a Labour Party Conference not as leader but as Employment spokesman back in 1990. I said: a Labour Government would introduce a minimum wage; a legal right to union recognition; sign the Social Chapter; restore trade union rights at GCHQ; improve maternity leave; introduce paid holidays; end blacklisting; and remove the power of automatic dismissal for those lawfully on strike.</p> <p>We have done every one of those things. But we only did them by being in Government not in permanent Opposition.</p> <p>There is another thing I want to remind you about that period. The name of my opposite number in the Tory Cabinet that gave us mass unemployment, soaring interest rates, and the poll tax. You may remember him. Mr Michael Howard.</p> <p>And I've told you what I said in 1990.</p> <p>Let me tell you what he said in 1990.</p> <p>That the minimum wage would cost 1 million jobs.</p> <p>That the social chapter would cost another half million.</p> <p>He was talking nonsense then. He talks nonsense now.</p> <p>And if we want to keep our economy strong, we need to keep Mr Howard in Opposition.</p> <p>None of this - not the economic strength, not the legislation to correct injustice at work, came through chance, but through choice. The choice you made was not to make demands you knew won't be met; nor to hark back to the past; but to understand economic stability had to be the irreducible bedrock of economic opportunity and social progress.</p> <p>Seven years on, our long-term interest rates are the lowest for 25 years, matching continental levels. Employment has risen steadily without generating inflation. Economic growth is currently the highest in the G8 with 29 quarters of consecutive growth since 1997. The public finances are in good shape. Immense productivity challenges remain, but the foundations of future prosperity are being laid. </p> <p>And the difference we have made to the living standards of hard-working families since we came to office is crystal clear. Average monthly mortgage payments are \u00a3400 less under this government than under the Conservatives. Property repossessions, so devastating during the late 1980s, are now at a historic low. Families are far better off with living standards growing by a fifth since 1996/97. The average working family with children is \u00a31350 a year better off in real terms since Labour came to power. The poorest fifth are over \u00a33000 a year better off in real terms. </p> <p>It's a clear reminder that economic stability is for a purpose - to create a fairer, more prosperous society with decent provision for the least advantaged, and world-class public services for all.</p> <p>Full employment has transformed regions of the country left behind in the Eighties. Across Britain's cities, City centres and riversides that had become drab, empty at night, are now vibrant. Derelict factories and empty warehouses have been converted into new homes and businesses providing the jobs of the future. Britain is working, its economy now one of the most dynamic and competitive in the world. </p> <p>We are the only major nation in the world that for the last two years and the next two will be increasing public investment in healthcare and education as a percentage of national income. The only one.</p> <p>Alongside that 700,000 children have been lifted out of poverty. Almost two million pensioners relieved from acute hardship. And there has been record help for poorer families through childcare benefit, tax credits and family support.</p> <p>So when I hear people saying we should pursue Labour policies not Tory ones, I say what could be more Labour than record jobs, record investment in the NHS and millions lifted out of poverty.</p> <p>And yet you don't continue to govern on the basis of your record but on the basis of your vision of the future.</p> <p>The truth is modern life for many of our people is tough. There are jobs but they are often insecure. There are still too many people who are sick and disabled who would like to work, but don't have the opportunity to do so. The minimum wage may give some protection but it's hard to raise a family on it. Years ago, if you talked of pensions, you meant pensioners. Today, there is real anxiety amongst those of working age as to how to save for their retirement. More women work than ever before but balancing work and family life is a struggle and equal pay still an aspiration not a reality for millions of women.</p> <p>And what's more, even if people are in work, reasonably secure, comfortably off, the economy they work in is part of a world market that has never seen such revolutionary changes in technology, in consumer tastes, and in the scale of competition. China and India each with well over one billion people mean that every European nation no longer competes today only with America and Japan, let alone only each other.</p> <p>So how do we - us in Government, you in trade unions and in business - help our people cope with change, survive it and prosper in it?</p> <p>When I opened recently one of the many new community centres in the former coalfields in the North East, there was a union banner. It featured a picture of Peter Lee, who in 1869 founded the miners' union in the Durham Coalfield. The union was formed to break the virtual serfdom with which the coal owners ruled those that worked for them. The union successfully fought for miners' rights. In time, in Durham alone over 120 collieries employed 150,000 men. But the union did more than fight for them at the workplace. It founded mutual societies to provide them with help for medical care and pensions. It looked after legal claims and families bereaved. The unions stood for solidarity not only at work, but also through life.</p> <p>No one works in the mines of Durham today. The whole economy of the North East is new. The jobs are new. The way of life is new. Within a few years of the mines closing, Fujitsu, one of the great Japanese hopes of inward investment, had set up its factory in my constituency and closed it again when the microchip market collapsed. The process of change is constant. </p> <p>So the issue for trade unions is the same as for the rest of us: how to adapt to change, to keep principles intact whilst the reality in which they exist, has been transformed. </p> <p>Once before, you took a decision to put aside the past in order to equip the Labour Party to govern successfully. Today, I ask you - as social partners to do the same - to help the country succeed.</p> <p>This to me is the significance of what was agreed at Warwick. </p> <p>There can be no return to the industrial relations framework of the 1970s, no move away from the enterprise and dynamism a modern economy needs. We cannot and will not reverse the programme of change and modernisation that together with record investment is delivering public services combining equity with choice and excellence. </p> <p>Union members are not just workers. They use the NHS. They need good state schools for their children. And they know that the welfare state of 2004 not 1945 has to be one that re-distributes opportunity not merely pays more out in benefit.</p> <p>These changes as much as the money are allowing us to cut dramatically the waiting time for operations; make sure, for example that no London Borough now has pass rates of under 40 per cent for GSCEs, up from 25 per cent in 1997; and make long-term youth unemployment literally disappear. This is not selling out; it is paying back, reducing inequality, extending opportunity, giving hope.</p> <p>Warwick should be seen not as diluting the changes we have made but conditioning them with one very basic set of principles at its heart: good jobs don't come with bad work practices; successful employers don't succeed by abusing their employees; quality public services don't achieve excellence by undervaluing public servants.</p> <p>In other words, our belief is that the more we value, invest in, understand and resolve the dilemmas of those that produce the wealth and services of our nation, in the modern world, the more likely we are to have the future we desire.</p> <p>What does this mean in practice?</p> <p>First, let us be clear. For Britain to prosper and thrive in the future, we need a vibrant modern manufacturing sector, just as much as a powerful service sector, and world-class public services. </p> <p>Manufacturing in the UK has gone through a difficult time as it has in every developed country in the world. There are real successes: pharmaceuticals and aerospace, or ICT and the biotechnology industry; truly world-class enterprises, of which any country should be proud. </p> <p>Britain's car industry - once thought to be in terminal decline - has been reinvigorated, gaining a new lease of life. </p> <p>Nissan in Sunderland is the most productive car plant in Europe, last month producing the millionth Nissan for the UK market. The new MINI built at Cowley is a runway success with half a million cars now coming off the production line, and the sector as a whole is now the UK's largest source of manufactured exports. </p> <p>But there is a huge amount to do. We will continue to see how investment in technology, the tax system for capital investment, and help for businesses to grow can benefit manufacturing.</p> <p>And in every region, each RDA is now working up a strategy to build on the particular strengths of its manufacturing enterprises. </p> <p>This Government now set to make the largest sustained investment in science for a generation, \u00a33 billion a year. Such a commitment means modernised labs, better pay for researchers, new research programmes at the cutting edge of human knowledge. </p> <p>Let me also make it absolutely clear that the Government is determined to protect research staff facing daily threats of intimidation and violence from animal rights extremists and will bring forward legislation to ensure this.</p> <p>Second, Warwick signifies that skills, once a social cause - are now an economic imperative. </p> <p>Britain will not succeed if over a third of its workforce lacks basic qualifications. </p> <p>We've started by creating a new framework for skills and are on course to meet our 2007 target to help 1.5 million adults get basic skills and qualifications. We're also working with the TUC on the proposals for a TUC Academy to take the skills agenda even further. </p> <p>Since 1998, we've invested \u00a335 million in the Trade Union Learning fund, and put Union Learning Reps on a statutory footing. We want to treble these numbers by 2010. </p> <p>Education Maintenance Allowances have been extended to every 16-19 year from a low-income background remaining in full-time education. We are extending the offer of free tuition for those without level 2 qualifications to every worker. And we are now examining whether it is possible to extend financial support to those seeking Level 3 qualifications for 19-30 year olds which with the other changes would represent the biggest expansion in access to skills for half a century.</p> <p>In over a third of the country, we are now piloting employer training schemes.</p> <p>We have expanded Modern Apprenticeships from 70,000 to 200,000 but I can tell you today we are now aiming at 300,000 modern apprenticeships by the end of 2006. </p> <p>Next, because there is today, rightly, far greater interaction between public, private and voluntary sectors to deliver public services, we have agreed a new deal to tackle the two-tier workforce. </p> <p>In local government, we have already acted to end the 'two-tier' workforce. At Warwick, we made the commitment to end it across the public sector; and we will fulfil that commitment. </p> <p>In some workplaces, there is a long hours culture regardless of whether it is productive. We have introduced a right for people to choose not to work more than 48 hours, and an entitlement for the first time to four weeks paid holiday a year. We are committed to ensuring that people are able to exercise a genuine choice about the hours they work. </p> <p>And let me repeat the commitment we made at Warwick that in a third term, the Labour Government will extend the paid holiday entitlement, so that the four-weeks is always an addition to eight days of public holiday. </p> <p>Our new family friendly law means that employers are now required to consider seriously requests from parents with children under six - or disabled children under 18 - to work flexibly. Nearly one million parents have taken advantage of the new law, and have applied for a change in working hours. Eight out of ten requests have been accepted in full. </p> <p>It is not right that mothers or fathers are refused time off to see their sick child through a hospital operation, the right to time off when a family member is ill. </p> <p>So we want to build on what's so far been achieved. </p> <p>We've made a commitment to our social partners not to introduce any changes before 2006. But the time is right to start thinking about the next steps. In particular, we will examine how we can extend this right to flexible working to the growing numbers of citizens who have caring responsibilities for the elderly and disabled. </p> <p>From the spring of next year, employees will have new rights to Information and Consultation at work, not preventing necessary change at work, but ensuring employees are treated as partners in that change.</p> <p>We will we act to root out abuse at the very bottom of the labour market where working people are most vulnerable. The Government will support Jim Sheridan MP's Private Member's Bill to curb exploitative activities among agricultural gang masters. We will improve protection for migrant workers, strengthening measures against employers who seek to exploit them. It is neither fair for those who are exploited, nor for those firms who do play by the rules when a few rogue employers are able to get away with ignoring the law.</p> <p>You know our concerns on agency workers to maintain necessary labour market flexibility. But whilst we must meet those concerns, we will support the EU Directive on Agency Workers.</p> <p>And we'll ensure greater safety for front-line workers in retailing, transport, and the public services, those who working to help others, face the constant daily threat of violence and anti-social behaviour. </p> <p>We will publish proposals on corporate manslaughter in the current parliamentary session, and introduce legislation to ensure that corporations are prosecuted for a serious criminal offence where they show such wilful disregard for their employees that it results in death. </p> <p>Finally, building on Barbara Castle's Equal Pay Act, Margaret Prosser's Women and Work Commission will enable us to ensure that in our generation, we close the gap in pay and opportunity between men and women at the workplace. </p> <p>This is not an agenda about flying pickets, secondary action or the closed shop. Leave the past to the past. But it is an agenda that if carried through, will radically improve the lives of Britain's hard working and hard-pressed families. </p> <p>Work with us to get these changes. Help us to fashion them in a way that most benefits your members, actual and prospective. Make a reality of the social partnership with sensible forward-looking employers who share the belief that efficiency and fairness go hand in hand.</p> <p>Trade unions have a past of which they are rightly proud. Today they are reaching out to the future. In the public services, \"Agenda for Change\" in the NHS, the \"Schools Workforce Reform\" programme in education mean radical change in the way services will operate, but they are changes not just supported but in many cases, shaped by constructive union participation.</p> <p>Across the private sector, unions like Amicus at Rolls Royce, UNIFI at Royal Bank of Scotland, CWU at Alliance &amp; Leicester have protected or enhanced company pension schemes in imaginative ways to keep their members. The GMB, GPMU, and TGWU are now actively involved all over Britain in setting up skills and learning centres with the help of the Government's Modernisation Fund. The Shop workers Union is not just increasing members but taking the lead, where the employer is in difficulty in helping the company change, restructure and prosper.</p> <p>One final area for work: pensions. There is no easy solution. The blunt truth is that the population is ageing; people live longer; and yet want, unsurprisingly, the higher living standards they experienced while working, to continue into retirement. We need to get the balance right between what the State ie the taxpayer, the individual and employer each contribute; and we need to get the system right to facilitate that contribution. But one thing I can say to you: the Basic State Pension and guarantees against pensioner poverty will always be an essential part of our solution to this issue; and you in the Trade unions should be, along with business and industry, part of the partnership to get it right.</p> <p>Those who said unions could never adapt to the challenge of the new economy and its changes are being proved wrong. Of course, wherever there is the possibility of industrial disputes, those capture the headlines. But the true face of modern trade unionism is not to be found in the exception of industrial breakdown, but in the broad rule of social partnership and progress.</p> <p>We won't go back to the agenda of the past. But there is much for us now to do on the new agenda and do it together. To people at work, wondering whether membership of a trade union has anything to offer them, I would say: go and see. See what a modern trade union can do; see the breadth of services they provide; see the help in troubled times they can give; and if you want to, join.</p> <p>And in doing so, join us in building on the record of the past few years to seek new ambitions, new heights to scale, new ways to work, live and prosper.</p> <p>I go back to that 1990 speech. I said then: \"These are the forward-looking priorities we shall establish by our historic decisions today. The British people can now be clear. It is the Tories, not us, who believe that industrial relations is merely industrial warfare, arcane endless legal disputes about strikes and pickets as if the field of employment were merely a field of battle. It is they who are unable to escape the politics of conflict and grasp the potential for partnership. It is they who embrace the agenda of the 70s and 80s because they have no answer to the problems of the future. Let them: leave the past to those who live in it. This party belongs in the future and we can address that future with confidence and hope.\"</p> <p>It was true 14 years ago. It remains true now.</p>",

  "<p>Sarah Lancashire is to take on the role of miscarriage-of-justice mother Angela Cannings in a BBC1 docudrama about the woman who was wrongly jailed for the murder of two of her children. </p> <p>The former Coronation Street and Clocking Off star will appear in Cherished alongside Auf Wiedersehen Pet's Timothy Spall, who will play her husband, Terry. </p> <p>Mrs Cannings spent two years in prison fighting to clear her name before her conviction was quashed by the court of appeal at the end of last year. A lengthy BBC investigation was instrumental in helping her clear her name.</p> <p>Cherished will be the third collaboration between the BBC's drama and current affairs departments - after Holy Cross and Dirty War - and will begin filming this autumn.</p> <p>\"I'm delighted to be playing the part of Angela\" said Mrs Lancashire. \"When I read the script I was very moved. The loss of any child is a dreadful thing, the loss of three is unimaginable.</p> <p>\"Whilst any parent could relate to the anguish that Terry and Angela must have felt, I cannot comprehend the strength it must have taken to sustain Angela through even a part of a life sentence. Theirs is a remarkable story.\"</p> <p>It will feature pivotal behind-the-scenes moments, such as the decision to charge Angela based purely on the opinion of three medical experts. One of them, Professor Sir Roy Meadow, said there was a 73 million to one chance of two children in the same family dying of cot death.</p> <p>\"We're still suffering the aftermath of this whole episode,\" said Mrs Cannings, who was convicted with no physical evidence. \"This film is for Jade, my daughter's benefit, so when she is older she can see what it was all about. </p> <p>\"The general public would assume that we've got back together and that's it. But there is an awful lot of healing. It doesn't just heal overnight. Even now I sit and think why we had to go through all that. We've had quite a lot to do with the scriptwriter; the BBC has been very good. They've dealt with us very fairly.\"</p> <p>The law was changed following Mrs Cannings' case, ensuring that no one can be convicted in a criminal case without physical evidence and on the basis of an expert witness alone. Despite the BBC's role in her acquittal, the corporation missed out in an exclusive interview with Ms Cannings when it was outbid by ITV's Tonight.</p> <p>\"Angela was effectively living a prison sentence even before she was convicted because she had to move out of the family home and had only limited access to her daughter Jade,\" said executive producer Sue Hogg. \"Eventually, she was allowed five visits a week for two hours and only in the presence of a social worker.</p> <p>\"But the film doesn't demonise the social services or the police. They are just people in society doing a very tough job, but a tough job which, when there is a miscarriage of justice, can have terrible consequences.\"</p> <p>Ms Hogg will executive produce the drama with Simon Lewis. It is written by Gwyneth Hughes, who wrote ITV drama Blood Strangers, in which Caroline Quentin played a mother whose teenage daughter is murdered after becoming a prostitute. It is being produced by Polly Hill and Jim Booth, with the BBC's investigative journalist John Sweeney acting as consultant.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "The home secretary, David Blunkett, will attempt to kick-start the second phase of his police reform programme today with pledges to provide a \"customer service culture\" which gives the public a real say in local policing. <p>Mr Blunkett, speaking at the Police Superintendents' Association conference, will expand on the minimum standards of service that the public can expect from the police and how they can trigger immediate official action on particular persistent problems, such as anti-social behaviour. </p> <p>The superintendents are expected to tell the home secretary that they are going to campaign to put traffic police back on the roads under the slogan \"cameras don't care - traffic cops do\". </p> <p>He is also expected to face renewed demands for the 43 police forces in England and Wales to move towards a more national structure. </p> <p>But the home secretary is likely to warn that the experience in other areas of public sector, such as the health service, is that structural changes can prove expensive and initially lead to a dip in performance. Home Office ministers are wary of introducing changes in the structure of police forces if it is at the expense of driving up standards of service. </p> <p>The detailed implementation of the second phase of police reform - one of the flagship bills of Tony Blair's public services reform - is to be spelled out in a white paper before legislation this autumn. </p> <p>It is expected to prove more controversial than the the initial package, which included the modernisation of pay and conditions, the establishment of a national police standards unit and the introduction of community support officers. </p> <p>The legislation is likely to see the transfer of power and resources away from the 43 chief constables in their force headquarters down to the superintendents who run each of the 250 local police divisions known as basic command units. </p> <p>Home Office research published last week showed that most of the public want regular newsletters and a local, recognisable beat officer they can talk to. The reform package will include new ways in which the police can become \"embedded\" in local communities and responsive to their needs. </p> <p>The superintendents' president, Rick Naylor, is expected to defend their call for a national police force, arguing that it does not conflict with delivering different styles of local policing. </p> <p>Sir Michael Bichard's report into the way the Humberside and Cambridgeshire forces handled the Ian Huntley case is widely seen in the police as the most graphic example of the differing ways that two police forces deal with one piece of information. </p> <p>But the superintendents believe it is symptomatic of a wider malaise involving different approaches to issues that demand a national approach. </p> <p>The campaign to bring back traffic police is based on the idea that it is the \"forgotten arm of policing\" and that all the police do is put up cameras and persecute \"innocent\" motorists while the number of road deaths fails to fall.</p>",
  "<p>Two of Europe's biggest car-makers, Volkswagen and Opel, will this week open the latest front in German industry's battle to slash costs, secure longer working hours and impose more flexible conditions - or cut tens of thousands of jobs and shift production overseas. </p> <p>Tomorrow VW opens pay talks with engineering union IG Metall over its demands for a two-year pay freeze and a 30% cut in labour costs by 2011 to preserve 103,000 jobs at its six west German plants. Otherwise, it says, it could axe 30,000 jobs. Opel is to begin negotiations with the same union over its plans to raise the working week from 35 hours to 40, to virtually halve Christmas bonuses and even impose a pay freeze for five years amid threats to close its main plant at R\u00fcsselsheim, near Frankfurt. </p> <p>The talks take place against the background of continuing protests over the German government's measures to lower benefits for the long-term unemployed and other labour market reforms in moves to revitalise Europe's biggest economy and reduce unemployment, now almost 11%. They provoked demonstrations in 200 German cities yesterday. </p> <p>The proposals tabled by VW and Opel are a substantial step-up from cost cuts implemented by DaimlerChrysler, owners of Mercedes, electrical equipment maker Bosch and engineering group Siemens, which met initial union resistance before agreement. </p> <p>Peter Hartz, VW's personnel chief and architect of Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's labour reforms, has said labour costs at VW's Czech plants are 80% lower than in west Germany, where wages are 20% higher than in other car firms' factories. VW's pay talks take place outside the engineering industry's collective bargaining arrangements, but 97% of its workforce is unionised. </p> <p>Bernd Pischetsrieder, VW's chief executive, has recently been forced to cut its profits forecast because of sluggish demand, pressure on sales and rising commodity prices. But he has told staff he wants to retain German jobs - if unions agree to help secure VW's long-term financial health. </p> <p>A decade ago VW, then faced with huge losses, set the trend in German industry by saving 30,000 jobs through instigating a four-day week; it now says the \"threat\" to 30,000 jobs is \"purely a mathematical extrapolation\" from the 30% cut in labour costs. </p> <p>Mr Hartz has angered local IG Metall negotiators by demanding the extension of his \"Auto 5000\" scheme, begun in 2001, for taking on the long-term jobless at the equivalent of \u20ac2,500 (\u00a31,706) a month, or well below prevailing rates. </p> <p>Hartmut Meine, the union's regional organiser, rejected this yesterday but indicated a willingness to revise the demand for a 4% pay rise if VW agreed to provide job guarantees.</p>",
  "<p>Jeremy Kingston's wittily ingenious play might once have found favour in the West End. Today it gets its premiere in a north London pub theatre, where it is briskly directed by Robert Gillespie and offers some tart, amusing comments on life, love, art and the problems of self-fulfilment. </p> <p>Kingston seizes on the fact that Agatha Christie, No\u00ebl Coward and Dickie Mountbatten all severally holidayed at the same hotel in Devon. So he brings them together for a weekend and allows their varied visions of life to intersect. Christie, although temporarily in flight from her husband, believes squarely in marital fidelity. Coward feigns sexual insouciance but is racked when his latest lover threatens to leave him. And Mountbatten, enjoying a last fling with a naval chum, hovers uncertainly on the brink of marriage to Edwina. </p> <p>Much of the play consists of camp chat conducted over cocktails and nuts; when Coward is in full spate, you get a heady mix of pastiche and pistachios. But Kingston raises serious issues, especially in a duel between Coward and Christie. \"Let me come to your point,\" Coward tells Agatha; she is trying to say that Dickie - because of his fury over the ostracism of his Germanic father, his improbable marriage and his ideas about building a whodunnit around an unreliable narrator - combines all the ingredients of betrayal. Coward suavely suggests that we each have to make our own accommodation with the demands of love and life and, in the end, \"dread nought\". </p> <p>I don't buy Kingston's criticism that the early work of Christie and Coward lacked, respectively, \"credible emotion\" and \"passion\". Coward, after all, went on to write The Vortex. But Kingston's play is full of sharp dialogues and perceptively suggests that our moral codes are based on our personal preferences. Robert Forknall excellently conveys Coward's love for machine-gun epigrams, while Caroline Wildi smoothly evokes the young Christie's ethical probity and Hywel John's bisexual Dickie is appropriately tricky. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until October 3.

  "What every woman allegedly really, really wants - apart, that is, from a size 10 figure, Jennifer Lopez's backside and the face of a wrinkle-free angel - is a baby or three. So how come the average number born to British females has fallen by a third in the past 30 years from 2.4 to 1.65? Why is it that an unprecedented one in four women is likely to remain childfree? <p>New research has apparently revealed that one of the main causes for this plunge in the population is the demise of the close-knit extended family. A couple is no longer able to call on this support network for cost-free childcare. </p> <p>In addition, granny and other relatives who traditionally acted as cheerleaders in the fertility Olympics, spurring on the conception of the first child (\"You don't want to leave it too late, do you, dear ...?\") are voices that are now literally much more distant. </p> <p>\"Our findings suggest that the more contact there is between kin, the more couples are urged to have children and pass on the family genes,\" Dr Lesley Newson told a British Psychological Society conference recently. \"All this urging creates social norms which value motherhood ...\" </p> <p>He and researchers from the University of Exeter looked at population trends across a number of western countries. They concluded that the major change was the scattering of the extended family across a wider geographical area than ever before. </p> <p>One of the problems with this is the assumption that a high proportion of childcare is still carried out by one's nearest and dearest, and therefore cheapest. Hardly mentioned in the latest scare about the quality of nursery care, for example, is the fact that only 18% of mothers with children under two work full-time, and half of those leave their child with family or friends. </p> <p>Anyway, population crises are nothing new. Contrary to the myth that motherhood is every female's dream, many are hugely ambivalent. This may manifest itself in a failure to attach to a child, discussed by Madeleine Bunting in these pages yesterday as an urgent contemporary problem, though it has long existed, albeit better camouflaged. If society demands too high a sacrifice in the name of parenthood or places obstacles in the way, ambivalence rapidly transmutes into resistance. </p> <p>In the late 1940s, for instance, the only child, \"the solitary ewe lamb\", was deemed a thing to deplore because he or she was increasingly common. Women, accustomed to nurseries and independence in the war years, were unwilling to produce copiously. A royal commission on population was set up and a family allowance established giving five shillings for every child after the first. </p> <p> Other ideas included rest homes for tired housewives and official neighbourhood babysitters. What actually did the trick in the end was the consumer boom. Men worked while women had spend-a-lot babies. </p> <p>Now, reproductive resistance is more complex. Most families need a wage and a half. Yet parents, in spite of some improvements, are still expected to be seen but not heard in public policy and the workplace. A radical change has yet to occur. </p> <p>What the government offers, instead, is long hours and access to professional childcare. What the average man and woman wants is a cut in the working day, fewer antisocial shifts and greater understanding of the way the family ought to weave into careers. </p> <p>According to research published by the Equal Opportunities Commission last week, more than a third of employers believe that pregnancy is \"an undue cost burden\". A thousand women a year take legal action after being sacked because they are pregnant. </p> <p>\"Others face pay cuts, demotion, hostile treatment or are made to work in an unsafe environment. The impact on these women's lives and the health and safety of the baby can be disastrous,\" says Julie Mellor, the commission's chairwoman. In that context, many women aren't so much turning away from motherhood - as discovering they have lost the option. </p> <p>In the past, couples married in their early 20s and had a baby a couple of years later - because that's what people did. Now, control rules. Medical advances and contraception peddle the illusion that it's possible to choose the \"right\" time - determined, for some, by career advance ment and material satisfaction. But then, when the magic moment arrives, nature refuses to comply - and it's bye, bye baby. </p> <p>If the aim is to stem the population decline - not least to create work slaves for our old age - then restitching the extended family is unrealistic and no cure. Instead, we need a statutory code of practice to protect employed pregnant women; more support for parents; a cultural shift in the workplace and a halt to the media's constant portrayal of babies as nothing but trouble - sabotaging sanity, careers, marriages and solvency. In spite of present terms and conditions, that's still only a tiny fraction of the truth. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Yvonne Roberts's latest novel, Shake!, is published by Headline </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:yroberts@dial.pipex.com\">yroberts@dial.pipex.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>7.30pm:</strong> Good evening everyone. The big news to bring you is that wee Henrik Larsson is not in the Barca starting line-up. Good news for Celtic you may think, but the reason he's not playing is because Ronaldinho, Eto'o, Deco and Giuly are. Fairly impressive. Also impressive, though, is Celtic's record in Europe at Parkhead. In recent years they've beaten teams of the calibre of Juventus, Porto and indeed, of course, Barcelona themselves. </p> <p>Celtic start with Hartson and Camara up front, with Sutton fit enough only for the bench. Juninho will play in the hole behind the two.</p> <p>This is arguably the toughest of the eight groups. Barcelona have one of their strongest teams since they won the European Cup in the early 90s, Milan are one of the favourites for the tournament, and Donetsk is never an easy place to get a result. If Celtic are to qualify, they need a good result tonight. It promises to be a classic. </p> <p><strong>Teams:</strong></p> <p> <strong>Celtic:</strong> Marshall, Agathe, Balde, Varga, McNamara, Petrov, Lennon, Thompson, Juninho, Hartson, Camara <br> <strong>Subs:</strong> Douglas, Sylla, Valgaeren, Sutton, Pearson, Lambert, McGeady </p> <p><strong>Barcelona: </strong> Valdes, Belletti, Puyol, Marquez, van Bronckhorst, Deco, Gerard, Xavi, Giuly, Eto'o, Ronaldinho <br> <strong>Subs:</strong> Martinez, Larsson, Sylvinho, Gabri, Fernando, Oleguer, Iniesta </p> <p><strong>7.42pm:</strong> The game has been delayed for 10 minutes because of \"turnstile failure\". On tonight of all nights, you might expect better. It has now become an indefinite delay. For crying out loud. Did they not think they might have a full house for this one? The floodlights will probably go later as well.</p> <p><strong>7.52pm:</strong> Still no word on when exactly the game will start. The fans don't care. They're having a good old sing-song bellowing along to You'll Never Walk Along. Even the Barca fans are sticking their scarfs in the air. Quite a sight. It's building the anticipation even more...</p> <p><strong>7.57pm:</strong> The players are waiting in the tunnel, so it can't be too long now. Barca have Alan Davies lookalike Carlos Puyol skippering them, but he doesn't look as calm as Hoops' captain Jackie McNamara. It seems to me all the seats are taken now, so I'm not sure what the reason is for the delay. </p> <p><strong>8.02pm:</strong> I'm beginning to feel like I do when waiting for my girlfriend to beautify herself before a night out on the town. There's going to be a further five minute delay. Pity the poor players, who are still hanging around the tunnel like a stench emanating from French sewers. I suppose at least they have an excuse now if they make any early blunders. Valencia have scored the first goal of the evening, incidentally, against Anderlecht I believe. </p> <p><strong>8.07pm:</strong> I'm starting to sound like a broken record. The players are STILL in the tunnel. Thank goodness it's a state of the art stadium, rather than the one I once waited in at Roots Hall (Southend). It was flaming cramped in that tunnel I can tell you.</p> <p><strong>8.10pm:</strong> Woohoo! They're out of the tunnel and on the pitch. The fans are too busy singing You'll Never Walk Alone for the 35th time this evening to notice so the rapturous reception is somewhat less tumultuous than expected. The Champions League anthem then blasts from the tannoy, but the Celtic fans manage to drown that out. Ok, heads down, here we go.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Patrick O'Sullivan has a theory for the delay that I do not understand. \"I blame those hanging chad tickets they printed. That was always going to be a bad move. \" My ignorance of the word \"chad\" leads me to leave this one open to severity or humour.</p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Celtic finally win their first touch after 48 seconds. But that's all it is, one touch. </p> <p>By the way, my subtlety was obviously too much for you. I was hoping someone, anyone, might email in to provide me with a definition of \"chad\".</p> <p><strong>2 min</strong> One touch and now one booking. It doesn't take John Hartson long to get himself into these events does it? A scything tackle on Marquez which was nowhere near the ball.</p> <p><strong>3 min</strong> Now it's Alan Thompson sliding around two-footed. The victim this time? Giovanni van Bronckhorst. The former Rangers man is about as popular in these parts as a student in a working man's pub.</p> <p><strong>5 min</strong> Markus Merk, the German ref who looks worryingly like Andy D'Urso, is going to be puffed out by half-time. Another free-kick, again to Barca. Celtic have certainly set their stall out. Now, do Ronaldinho and co fancy the challenge.</p> <p><strong>7 min</strong> Giuly is played through by Deco, but with Marshall rushing down upon him, the little Frenchman misses his kick.</p> <p>Thank you, Steve Ferrigan, who writes: \"Tell Patrick O'Sullivan that \"chad\" jokes are so very 2000 US presidential election. Rigging the computerized (or, sorry computerised) election booths will be the new humour come November.\" I think you already did, Steve, though it leaves me none the wiser.</p> <p><strong>8 min</strong> It's all Barca. A fierce Ronaldinho half-volley from the edge of the box whistles past the far post. If anyone fancies buying the Brazilian, it'll only cost you \u00a399m through his buy-out clause. Mr Abramovich?</p> <p><strong>9 min</strong> Henri Camara has Celtic's first shot, a decent effort forcing Valdes into a diving but comfortable save.</p> <p><strong>11 min</strong> David Marshall produces a good save with his left foot from a drive by Van Bronkhorst. That wouldn't have gone down too well with the locals. Meanwhile, Arsenal have scored through an own goal by Alex.</p> <p>\"The hanging chads (great name for a rock band) were the little pieces of punch card that refused to be detached properly when the Florida voting machines were operated in 2000,\" John Thompson informs me. How diseducated I am. It would be a great name for a rock band though. Can anyone beat it?</p> <p><strong>14 min</strong> Celtic have settled and are beginning to impose themselves on the game, rather than just on their opponents' shins. Ronaldinho is dropping deeper to pick up the ball. The contrast in styles is fascinating.</p> <p><strong>16 min</strong> A cross from Giuly is headed well wide by Eto'o. Martin O'Neill is jumping around more than my nephew after half a dozen cans of coke. Chelsea lead 2-0 after goals from John Terry and Didier Drogba.</p> <p><strong>18 min</strong> A lot of you are clearly experts on \"chads\", but, honestly, I have heard enough. Can we talk about something else now? Please?</p> <p><strong>GOAL! CELTIC 0 - 1 BARCELONA (Deco 19)</strong> A wonderful goal. Ronaldinho burst through the Bhoys' midfield before laying the ball on to Deco. The former Porto player, already unpopular for his antics in the Uefa Cup Final, drills the ball first time into the far corner from a tight angle.</p> <p><strong>21min</strong> A real let-off for Celtic. Giuly skips past Varga as if he wasn't there, which in fairness he might as well not be, before playing the ball across the box. Xavi hammers a shot into the side-netting.</p> <p><strong>23 min</strong> This is going to be really difficult for Celtic now. They haven't really settled, and Barca are just playing keep-ball and drawing the Celtic defenders out of position before creating chance after chance.</p> <p>Trent Smither, who himself has a mighty fine name, says: \"My friend came up with Dog Shock after dogs in Boston were electrocuted by stepping on manhole covers that had been accidentally wired to subterranean power lines.\" Credit to your friend.</p> <p><strong>25 min</strong> A powerful run from Jackie McNamara down the left-wing brings the crowd to life and Celtic a corner. Now, can they make something of it?</p> <p><strong>26 min</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>28 min</strong> It's Juninho's turn to enter Mr Merk's little black book, presumably as his diminutive features have caught the eye of the big German, as it certainly can't have been for a foul - Juninho's foot was nowhere near Van Bronckhorst when he went down.</p> <p><strong>30 min</strong>Thompson whips in a vicious free-kick from the right wing which just goes past the far post. It must have touched a Barca head as it's gone for a corner.</p> <p>Adrian Slobin says: \"Here's a band name for you: the how-about-commenting-on-the-games.\" No, that's rubbish. </p> <p><strong>31 min</strong> The corner leads to a bit of a goalmouth melee before the ball is eventually cleared. But at least Celtic are exerting some pressure now.</p> <p><strong>34 min</strong> Stilian Petrov is coming into the game more, which has to be good news for Bhoys fans. Now Marquez is booked for bringing down Henri Camara, who showed the kind of pace Wolves only saw when he hurried towards the exit.</p> <p>Rupert Deaglan knows how to get his name on the Guardian website: \"Great name for a band is The Mike Adamson Experience. That's got to be worth a mention, if only out of pity.\" Certainly is.</p> <p><strong>36 min</strong> Thompson's set-pieces are proving to be Celtic's most dangerous weapon. Another free-kick is headed over by Varga, who was just stretching too much to be able to control his effort.</p> <p><strong>39 min</strong> Poor Didier Agathe is having a bit of a shocker. He is yet to pass the ball to a Celtic team-mate, though it's probably quicker and easier to give the ball straight to a Barcelona player than to Neil Lennon.</p> <p><strong>41 min</strong> A supreme Barcelona move eventually breaks down when Eto'o gives the ball away. Until then they had strung about 20 passes together with Ronaldinho at the hub of everything.</p> <p><strong>43 min</strong> Marshall makes another good save, pushing behind a rasping Giuly strike. Jackie McNamara is having a torrid time against the French international. Mind you, he is being given no cover by his centre-halves or midfielders.</p> <p><strong>44 min</strong> Now Barca break down the left, with Van Bronckhorst's cross evading Marshall's reach. Varga hoofs the ball away in true \"have it\" style.</p> <p><strong>45 min</strong> Deco, the best player on the pitch, cuts the Celtic defence apart with a splendid pass, Giuly goes round Marshall, but Balde shows terrific speed to tackle. Another let-off.</p> <p><strong>45 + 1 min</strong> Finally, a clear opening for Celtic. Thompson was too slow to take advantage though. Having been played through by Petrov, the Englishman allowed Barca's defenders to get back and his eventual right-foot shot is too weak to trouble Valdes in the Barca goal.</p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> The half-time whistle is probably not a bad thing for Celtic, who have been in danger of falling further behind. Now Martin O'Neill can rally his troops, and maybe alter one or two things. He certainly needs to if he's to stem the flow of attacks which Deco, Giuly and Ronaldinho are leading. Celtic haven't lost in their last 17 European matches at Celtic Park, but something is going to have to change if they are to keep that run going.</p> <p><strong>Emails </strong> Rupert Deaglan is back, and wants to know: \"Anybody know any funny stories about the painter Richard Hamilton? I've got 20 lines to fill here and I'm about as inspired as the Celtic defence.\" We've already seen how uncultured I am, so I'll open this one to the floor...</p> <p>Meanwhile, I've been thinking. Seeing as Barca clearly don't need Larsson, maybe they could give him back to Celtic just for this game. Might make things a bit more even. Alternatively, O'Neill could just dispense with this ludicrous 4-3-1-2 formation, take the anonymous Juninho off, put Camara wide right, and stick Sutton up front. They clearly can't match Barca playing the same way, so why not revert to their normal approach?</p> <p><strong>More emails</strong> Or more band-names to be precise. Kevin Brady writes: \"Punk band name - 'My Dog Stole My Girlfiend' - or that may be a country western song.\" It may be, so pass the baton to Bill Hurd in Illinois: \"There's a Chicago band called the 'Gaza Strippers' - fronted by Rick Sims of Didjits fame.\" So there you go.</p> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Celtic have made a sub: Chris Sutton on for Juninho. I really should be a football manager, or perhaps I should reserve judgment until the end of the match. Camara has indeed moved to the right, and hopefully Petrov can charge forward more. Sutton and Hartson: now that's not the kind of combination you see in the Primera Liga too often. In the other game in the group, Milan are drawing 0-0 in Donetsk.</p> <p><strong>48 min</strong> Lennon has just given the ball away twice in the space of a minute, which is interesting because pundits always claim that if you give possession to foreign teams, they keep it for minutes. Well it didn't happen there.</p> <p>An anonymous person has just texted me to inform me that ESPN have an Irish person - also anonymous - commentating on the game, and that \"he's the worst person in the world\". Quite a compliment.</p> <p><strong>50 min</strong> Belletti, Barca's young Brazilian right back, makes another trademark run down the right before carelessly slicing his cross into the stand. Frank Rijkaard, the Barca manager sporting a Sideshow Bob haircut, looks unimpressed. Now, a free-kick 30 yards out for Thompson. What can he make of it?</p> <p><strong>51 min</strong> It finished nearer the corner flag than the goal. In fact, it doesn't even deserve to go down as a shot off-target. Just as many of my school report cards said, he should do better.</p> <p><strong>54 min</strong> PENALTY FOR BARCA McNamara blatantly takes out Giuly who was clean through. McNamara lucky only to be booked. </p> <p><strong>55 min</strong> SAVED BY MARSHALL Ronaldinho plays it to Marshall's left, and the youngster makes a fine one-handed save. Now, can that inspire the rest of his team?</p> <p><strong>56 min</strong> From the resultant corner, Marquez heads straight at Marshall. Seconds later, Xavi's volley from the edge of the box flies inches wide of Marshall's goal. How are Celtic still in this game?</p> <p><strong>GOAL! CELTIC 1 - 1 BARCELONA (Sutton 58)</strong> Incredible scenes. The substitution has worked perfectly. A powerful run down the right-wing from Camara and a fine low cross is diverted into the top corner by Sutton, who ran into the box with real conviction. Game well and truly on.</p> <p><strong>60 min</strong> Now Barca are rattled. Another cross from the right is headed wide by Hartson. Rijkaard is about to make a change. You know who is going to make an appearance.</p> <p> <strong>62 min</strong> Yep, here he comes. Larsson comes on for Ronaldinho. The Celtic legend is warmly received by all and sundry, though if he scores the winner, their tone may change. Joos Valgaeren has come on as well, though amidst the excitement I didn't catch whom he replaced. Ah, it's Hartson - that's a strange one. Presumably Camara will join Sutton up front. </p> <p><strong>65 min</strong> Jackie McNamara has reverted to right-back and Joos Valgaeren has become possibly the tallest left-back in the world. Larsson is yet to touch the ball.</p> <p>Trent Smither confirms: \"If the anonymous commentator on ESPN is Tommy Smith, the anonymous texter is correct. Horrible.\" But who is the worst commentator of all? John Barnes wins the most wooden presenter award hands down. Meanwhile, the anonymous texter has confirmed his identity is Ratters. As I'm probably the only one who knows him, this is quite irrelevant. Sorry. </p> <p> <strong>67 min</strong> A cracking Petrov left-foot volley from the edge of the box is spectacularly tipped over by Valdes. </p> <p> <strong>69 min</strong> The ball breaks for Thompson 15 yards out, but with the midfielder slow to shoot, Belletti almost does his job for him, prodding the ball agonisingly past the post with Valdes beaten. It's breathtaking stuff. And what's this? Camara wastes another opening by shooting tamely at the Barca keeper.</p> <p> <strong>73 min</strong> Barca are going with one up front after bringing on Iniesta for Eto'o. They seem to have weathered the Celtic onslaught.</p> <p><strong>75 min</strong> I almost spoke too soon. Another sweeping counter-attack from the home team results in Petrov's swerving pass which is well held by Valdes. The Barcelona keeper has been impressive this evening.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! CELTIC 1 - 2 BARCELONA (Giuly 77)</strong> Larsson was at the heart of the move, releasing Belletti down the right flank. The young Brazlian cut the ball back for Giuly, whose shot took a wicked deflection off McNamara standing right in front of Marshall. Disaster for Celtic who have been the better side for the last 20 minutes.</p> <p><strong>80 min</strong> McNamara has been stretchered off, though the nature of his injury is unclear. Momo Sylla is his replacement. Celtic have only one option now: hit it long towards Sutton and latch onto any breaks that fall their way.</p> <p><strong>GOAL! CELTIC 1 - 3 BARCELONA (Larsson 82) </strong> It had to happen. A catastrophic header back towards his own goal by Alan Thompson is seized upon by Larsson, and two touches later the ball is in the back of the net. There was no celebration from the Swede, but plenty from his team-mates. That's surely game over now.</p> <p><strong>84 min</strong> The ball is in the Barcelona goal, but it won't count. Having palmed away Petrov's well-struck free-kick, Valdes is finally beaten by Sylla's acrobatic shot, but the Celtic man was a couple of yards offside.</p> <p><strong>87 min</strong> Celtic look thoroughly deflated, and even the fans have stopped singing now. Barcelona are running rings round their opponents and it's all too easy really.</p> <p>Alan Nocker has been storing this up for some while: \"The worst commentator in the world is Juan Manuel who does the Fox Latin coverage of the Premier League. He not only sings (badly) when anyone scores but he is racist and repetitive. He has Cygan nicknamed as Frankenstein, Lehman as King Kong, Houllier as the professor and for some reason Kewell as Harry Potter. Not funny even the first time and he never changes and goes on and on and on and ......\" You find them everywhere, Alan.</p> <p><strong>89 min</strong> There's going to be four minutes of stoppage time, which has made the overly optmistic commentator believe there's still hope. There isn't, but there is a free-kick near the corner flag.</p> <p><strong>90 + 1 min</strong> There's nothing left to talk about in the game, so an aside from Peer Jensen: \"The ESPN chappie is Tommy Smyth with a y.\" I'm hoping my colleague Rob Smyth misses that little blunder.</p> <p><strong>Full time</strong> The ref puts Celtic out of their misery. Apart from a short spell in the second half, Barcelona were far too good for their hosts. With Milan winning 1-0 in Donestk, Celtic are bottom of the group. Next up: a trip to the San Siro. It's going to be very tough for the Bhoys to progress now. Barcelona, on the other hand, will be a match for anyone in the knockout rounds. Thanks for all your emails, Mike.</p>",
  "<p>The vision and originality of the film, theatre and television production designer Bruce Macadie, who has died aged 54 following a heart attack, enhanced many landmark BBC dramas from the 1980s into the 1990s. </p> <p>Educated at the Arts Educational Trust, after early training as a dancer he studied at Wimbledon College of Art. He began his career in 1972, designing at the National Ballet of Washington, then returned to be associate designer at the Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh. In 1974, he joined BBC Television, art-directing I, Claudius (1976) and co-designing Dennis Potter's Pennies From Heaven (1978). At the same time, he was creating sets for the Les Dawson and Dick Emery shows. </p> <p>Macadie began to collaborate with directors whose subjects and styles matched his own enthusiasms, in particular David Thacker, for whom he designed TV adaptations of Arthur Miller plays, including Broken Glass and Death Of A Salesman (1996), and the acclaimed Hard Times (1994), which won him a Royal Television Society award. He crafted a bleak contemporary setting for the 1987 production of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party, and for Nigel Finch's The Lost Language Of Cranes (1991). </p> <p>He worked with particular relish and dark exuberance on period pieces, including Tristram Powell's The Count Of Solar (1992), Thacker's versions of Measure For Measure (1994) and The Mayor Of Casterbridge (2003). For producer Simon Curtis, he designed painterly Jacobean interiors for The Changeling (1994). </p> <p>Macadie created a Renaissance look, described by Nancy Banks-Smith as of \"sumptuous beauty\", for my film, Cariani And The Courtesans (1987), bringing him a second RTS design award. He also designed for me a film of Bartok's opera Duke Bluebeard's Castle, winner of the 1988 Prix Italia, and the period feature film The Hour Of The Pig (1993). </p> <p>His stage work included a long collaboration with London's Bush Theatre. There, and at the Hampstead Theatre, he designed plays by Simon Block, Tony Bicat and Jonathan Hall, teaming up regularly with directors Gemma Bodinetz and Mike Bradwell. He worked on Bradwell's production of The Glee Club (2002) by Richard Cameron, which transferred from the Bush to the West End, and on Bodinetz's staging of Guiding Star, an acclaimed 1998 play by Jonathan Harvey. He also designed for the London Coliseum and the Royal Opera House Tchaikovsky gala (1993). </p> <p>Bruce sought out work that would stretch him; he would casually mention, at a first meeting, what particular costume or make-up designers he had worked with were available, thus keeping a firm, but unobtrusive grip, on the entire design concept. His researches were exhaustive; he would delve deep into the relevant literature and iconography, bringing new and unexpected dimensions to the script. </p> <p>He created a special bond with performers, actors and singers, taking pleasure in their skill.

  "Ken Barrett is the first person brought to justice for the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane. But his admission of guilt, 15 years after the killing, is just one part of a shadowy web of collusion, conspiracy and cover-up which made this one of the most controversial crimes in three decades of bloodshed in Northern Ireland. <p>Although the Ulster Defence Association/Ulster Freedom Fighters, the loyalist terror group to which Barrett belonged, claimed responsibility for the hit, the Finucane family have always been convinced that the security forces aided paramilitaries in a plot they insist went to the heart of the British establishment, and that only a public inquiry will bring out the truth. </p> <p>Last year, Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan police commissioner, who has carried out inquiries in Northern Ireland over the past 15 years, confirmed that several police and soldiers did indeed collude with the terrorists who carried out the shooting. </p> <p>Sir John's investigations exposed a terrifying world of undercover spies who would seemingly go to any lengths to win the war against the IRA. </p> <p>He found that police and army officers allowed informers and agents to operate \"without effective control and participate in terrorist crimes\" and that more than 20 loyalist murders, including Finucane's, from the mid-1980s to early 1990s, could have been prevented. </p> <p>Sir John has forwarded files on more than 20 former and serving police and army officers to the Crown Prosecution Service. They include Brigadier Gordon Kerr, now the British military attache in Beijing, who in 1989 headed the murky military intelligence operation in Northern Ireland, the Force Research Unit. </p> <p>Finucane, a 39-year-old Catholic who had successfully represented many top republicans, including IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands, was a thorn in the British establishment's side. </p> <p>Three weeks before the murder, Douglas Hogg, then a junior home office minister, told the Commons that certain solicitors in Northern Ireland were unduly sympathetic to the IRA. </p> <p>Finucane was having dinner with his wife, Geraldine, and their three children in their north Belfast home on February 12 1989, when two masked gunmen broke down the door with sledgehammers. They pumped 14 shots, from a .38 revolver and a 9mm Browning automatic pistol, all of which hit Finucane and one of which ricocheted, hitting his wife's foot. The killers made their getaway in a stolen taxi. </p> <p>The UDA said it carried out the hit because Finucane was a high ranking IRA officer, a claim staunchly denied by his family and friends. </p> <p>Although Finucane's brothers had strong IRA links, the solicitor counted prominent loyalists as well as republicans among his clients, and police at his inquest said there was absolutely no evidence to suggest he was in the IRA. </p> <p>But almost from the moment the triggers were pulled, dark suggestions surfaced that police officers and British soldiers helped have Finucane killed. </p> <p>There were persistent allegations that detectives had suggested the lawyer as a target to loyalists. Police roadblocks near the Finucane home were lifted just before the murder, and the involvement of various army and police agents emerged over the next few years. </p> <p>In 1991, Barrett, by then a police informer, boasted about killing Finucane to an RUC detective, Johnston \"Jonty\" Brown, who secretly recorded the conversation. He said Barrett told him Finucane was still holding a fork in his hand as he fired several shots into his head. Mr Brown gave the tape to Special Branch but it went missing and Barrett was not arrested. The detective said Barrett, a compulsive gambler, was one of the most cold-blooded killers he had ever met, and once admitted carrying out 10 murders, a claim he had no reason to doubt. </p> <p>In 1992 a UDA/army double agent, Brian Nelson, claimed to the BBC Panorama programme that he had scouted the Finucane house weeks before the murder, and passed on photographs and a dossier to loyalist killers, but tipped off his army handlers about the murder plot. He was jailed after admitting unrelated conspiracy to murder offences, and died of lung cancer last year. </p> <p>In 1999, the Stevens team questioned Barrett about Mr Brown's evidence but no charges were brought. The same year, William Stobie, a self-confessed Special Branch informer and UDA quartermaster, was arrested. He admitted supplying the guns used in the murder but said he had twice warned his handlers about the threat. However, in November 2001, Stobie was freed when the chief prosecution witness was ruled unfit to testify. In December, the UDA shot Stobie dead, and a few weeks later, the Stevens team whisked Barrett, also under threat from his former comrades, to safety in Sussex. </p> <p>Barrett again talked about the murder, this time to the Panorama team. In a programme broadcast in June 2002, he claimed a police officer told him Finucane was a senior IRA man and had to be got rid of. </p> <p>\"The peelers wanted him whacked. We whacked him and that is the end of the story,\" he said, also revealing that Nelson showed him Finucane's house and gave him a photograph of the solicitor. </p> <p>Meanwhile, police in England launched an elaborate sting operation to get the evidence they needed to convict him. </p> <p>Barrett's house was bugged, recording conversations between him and his partner. A fake job advertisement was placed in a local paper, seeking a driver. Barrett took the bait. </p> <p><b> Drugs empire</b><br> </p> <p> His employers, two undercover police officers known only as \"Steve\" and \"Tom\", tipped him hundreds of pounds and put him up in hotels around the country, telling him they were running a drugs empire importing cannabis and cocaine from Germany. </p> <p>They persuaded him to talk about his paramilitary past by claiming they found out about his connection to the Finucane case on the internet and thought he had the potential to become a hit man for their operation. </p> <p>In covert recordings, Barrett told them he shot Finucane, attempting to justify it by saying the solicitor was a top IRA man. </p> <p>Finucane wasn't just shot, he was \"fucking massacred\", according to Barrett, who added: \"I lost no sleep over it. All is fair in love and war. I have to be honest, I whacked a few people in the past. People say, how do you sleep, Ken? I sleep fine.\"</p>",
  "Every now and again, to convince the politically unlettered that all this interminable Blair-Brown stuff matters, someone will describe some aspect of the story as \"Shakespearean\". Time magazine informed European readers that \"the brooding, complex Brown hungers for Blair's job with a Shakespearean avarice\". And a couple of months ago Blair's chief-of-staff, Jonathan Powell, reportedly chose novelist, magazine editor, newspaper columnist and Tory MP, Boris Johnson, to confide in, allegedly telling him that Brown was the doomed hero in a Shakespearean tragedy, \"the guy who thinks he's going to be king but never gets it\". <p>Is that right? As I learned at school from the works of Professor AC Bradley, \"No play that ends with the hero alive is, in the full Shakespearean sense, a tragedy ... It is, in fact, essentially a tale of suffering and calamity, conducting the hero to death ... the catastrophe will be of monumental proportions.\"</p> <p>How, on that basis, could you not be interested in Shakespearean tragedy? Yet I am not interested in the Blair-Brown argument. I am bored witless by it. And it is precisely the ways in which it deviates from Shakespearean tragedy that makes it so irritating.</p> <p>For a start, in Shakespeare we are allowed to know what's going on. But take this recent story from the Daily Telegraph: \"Friends of Mr Brown said through gritted teeth that the Chancellor had 'accepted' that he had lost the job of running the next general election campaign ... The chancellor's aides said they were 'shrugging their shoulders' at the news. The move was seen by friends of the chancellor as a deliberate attempt to break up Mr Brown's power base ...\" And so on, for the best part of eight years. Now imagine a play entitled, Friends of Antony and Sources Close to Cleopatra, in which the curtains stay closed for four hours and critics occasionally go backstage, emerging to tell the audience what they think is going on. </p> <p>Then there's the action itself. Hamlet does not speak \"through gritted teeth\" and Lady Macbeth does not \"shrug her shoulders\". They contemplate killing people, they drive people mad, or they get other people to kill people. For Gordon to be properly Shakespearean, he must marry Cherie, have David Miliband and Ruth Kelly smothered, drown Charles Clarke in a butt of Malmsey (OK, some scenarios are more plausible than others), and finally be run down outside the Winter Gardens by rivals while waiting in vain for his chauffeur to turn up. He must die. </p> <p>The scale is wrong, too. Can this cockpit hold the press briefing room in Downing Street? Or may we cram within this wooden \"O\" the very desks behind which sat Philip Bassett? And with room to spare. </p> <p>And the language is incongruous. </p> <p>\"This is the very top, </p> <p>The height, the crest, or crest </p> <p>unto the crest, </p> <p>Of murder's arms: this the </p> <p>bloodiest shame, </p> <p>The wildest savagery, the vilest </p> <p>stroke, </p> <p>That ever wall-eyed wrath or </p> <p>staring rage </p> <p>Presented to the tears of soft </p> <p>remorse. </p> <p>That I should not appointed be, </p> <p>Representative on the NEC.\"</p> <p>Shakespeare knew how to structure a story. He would surely pity us groundlings who are now captive at a play called Gordon Brown Pt XC (in which impatient columnists demand that the daggers be handed over to someone else). Yet this never-ending saga is about a Prince of Denmark who comes home to discover that his father has flu, about a Moor of Venice who goes to see his solicitor about a separation, about friends of Bolingbroke who deny that he has landed at Pembroke and reveal that he is on holiday in Ibiza. As Richard II said: \"[Death] comes at the last, and with a little pin / Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!\"</p> <p>If this is Shakespeare at all, it's an interminable performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream, in which capricious Toniana and Obrown, feuding with each other, mess about with the heads of everybody else in the forest aided by a gang of irritating fairies (played by lobby correspondents and political advisers). It's a version of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf in which George and Martha are not speaking to each other.</p> <p>Actually, it's this (as borrowed from Beckett): </p> <p>BLAIR: Why don't we hang </p> <p>ourselves? </p> <p>BROWN: With what? </p> <p>BLAIR: You haven't got a bit </p> <p>of rope? </p> <p>BROWN: No. </p> <p>BLAIR: Then we can't. </p> <p>[Silence] </p> <p>BROWN: Let's go. </p> <p>BLAIR: Wait, there's my belt. </p> <p>BROWN: It's too short. </p> <p>BLAIR: You could hang on to </p> <p>my legs. </p> <p>BROWN: And who'd hang </p> <p>on to mine? </p> <p>BLAIR: True. </p> <p>Enough, already.</p> <p><b>Deliver me from lies about computers</b></p> <p>Recently, we did what everybody else round here seems to do, and had our shopping delivered by a famous supermarket. I am not allowed to tell you which one because of a Guardian rule that says: \"No using your job to get back at people you don't like.\" (Now there's a law more honoured in the breach ...)</p> <p>So one afternoon I'm waiting for the stuff to arrive when a woman phones and says that she knows it's not a good start, but the computer has gone down, all our details (and everyone else's) have been lost, and she's sorry but can we reorder? </p> <p>Computer failure is today's act of a capricious God. It used to be locusts; now it's computer failure. So we put together the order again, cobble together something for that night's supper, and - next day - my partner phones it through. Ah yes, she's told by someone else, we didn't have enough drivers on yesterday, so we delivered the morning stuff only. But what about the computers, asks my partner, didn't you have a failure? Nope, says the order-taker.</p> <p>I was lied to. The first woman should have rung up and said, \"Look, you know you've been waiting in for this order? Well, we bolloxed up the arrangements and the drivers aren't going to get there. What do you think of that?\" And I would have told her to get a bloody driver to deliver our bloody order. Whereas I couldn't tell her to reconstruct a thousand lost orders.</p> <p>Do I need to add that the company then delivered half of what we reordered, leaving the other half in the van, later pretending that they had run out of stock and then promising to bring it round the next day? Or that we will never, ever use them again? It is a shame that I can't tell you who they were - and an equal shame that a recent takeover bid failed. But it made me wonder whether this absurd lying to customers is something that goes on a lot. Tell me.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:David.Aaronovitch@theguardian.com\">David.Aaronovitch@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>On Sunday night, Andrew Murray ate at a restaurant, near Times Square in New York, where the waiters and waitresses are actors-in-training who perch on your table and sing in your face. Then he played cards with his friends, into the small hours, and won $30 - which was $30 more, incidentally, than he received earlier the same day for becoming the UK's first ever boys' champion in the US Open, and the first serious hope for the future of British tennis in an awfully long time, by beating the Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky 6-4, 6-2. Instead, his prize was a fragile glass cup from Tiffany's, which Murray's mother, Judy, a compact and focused woman who is also Scotland's leading tennis coach, is determinedly smothering in bubble wrap. \"We'll never get this home in one piece,\" she frets, while her long-limbed 17-year-old son paces the lobby of their hotel, chewing expressionlessly on a bagel.</p> <p>It's quite enough of a psychological burden, of course, to be spoken of by knowledgeable onlookers as \"the next Tim Henman\" - a life sentence at the mercy of Britain's uniquely screwed-up attitude to its tennis players, whom we pressure to win, then castigate when they don't, all the while secretly enjoying our status as eternal underdogs. But in Murray's case there is something more. On March 13, 1996, the future tennis star, then nine, was walking through a corridor towards the gymnasium at his primary school in Dunblane when Thomas Hamilton entered the premises carrying four guns, walked into the gym, and murdered 16 pupils and their teacher before shooting himself; Murray, along with other pupils, was diverted into the headteacher's study, where he waited out the massacre. He thus shoulders the double burden not only of rescuing British tennis from decades in the doldrums - but of sparing his hometown the fate of being forever linked only with death. </p> <p>Already, as teenage fans approach him in the lobby and persuade him to autograph their arms, Murray is busy perfecting the Henman method for shielding oneself from the weight of expectations - a dual strategy of energetically avoiding the sources of the pressure and pretending that it isn't really that much of a problem anyway. \"Yeah, everybody's looking for the next Tim Henman, so there's a little bit of pressure on me with that,\" he says. \"But, you know, I just try not to think about it. I'm training in Spain now, just trying to keep away from everything. I think if I stayed at home in Britain there would just be too much pressure.\" </p> <p>Henman, with whom he hung out a little at the US Open last week, is admirably relaxed about it all, Murray says, and, he adds, growing slightly defiant, he has every right to be. \"They're always expecting him to win it, wanting him to win it, but then he always falls a little bit short, and everyone's like, 'Oh, it's a disaster, Henman's failed again.' But British tennis would be in pretty bad shape without him.\" </p> <p>At least the pressure from Murray's family - surprisingly, given Judy's status as the outgoing national coach of Scotland, and the fact that his brother, Jamie, is also an accomplished player - seems relatively gentle, and mediated by humour. \"It was my birthday this week,\" Judy explains, \"and he woke me up and said, happy birthday, woman - my sons call me 'woman' - and he said he probably wouldn't have any time to buy me a present, so he'd try to win the tournament instead. I said that would be nice.\" </p> <p>She regards at the Tiffany's goblet sceptically. \"I could put some flowers in it, I suppose.\" </p> <p>The Murrays would prefer not to mention the Dunblane massacre at all, but they are resigned to the significance of Andrew's inescapable status as a survivor. He can't remember much of that day himself, he says. \"I was so young, I didn't realise the importance, didn't realise it was such a big deal. Everyone was crying; there were days off school. And, of course, for the people who lost brothers and sisters - some of whom were in my class at school - it was so difficult for them. But I was just one of the lucky ones who got away. It was five years later, when it had all died down and people had recovered, that I began to understand how big it had been.\" </p> <p>Needless to say, the events of that day are burned into Judy's mind. She had to endure an agonised wait outside the school gates before discovering that, even as her closely knit community was being attacked at its heart, her two sons had survived. As a consequence, Andrew's every success on the tennis court is inevitably freighted with redemptive potential - with the possibility of making Dunblane stand for something else. \"I'd like to give everybody there something to be happy about,\" he says simply. \"So that every time anybody said Dunblane it wasn't just 'Oh, the disaster'.\" </p> <p>Whether it is this that gets him out of bed in the mornings is a harder question to answer; not uniquely among professional sportspeople, his motivations seem an inscrutable mix of doing it for his country, doing it for his family, and doing it for himself. He is certainly not doing it for the lifestyle: junior tournaments are all right, he says, because there are \"loads of guys around that you know, and a lot of girls around too,\" but senior tournaments sound rather lonely. \"If I go to play one in Spain by myself,\" he says, \"I don't speak the language, and there's no girls' tournament, so it's just guys four or five years older than me who I don't know.\" He grimaces, half-jokingly. In the evenings, on trips like that, he says, he plays computer games and watches TV. </p> <p>He also isn't doing it for the money - not at this point, anyway. Winning the US Open will certainly make an enormous difference with sponsorship, but there are no big profits on the international circuit for Murray just yet. Soon after her son's victory on Sunday, Judy received a text message from another of her young Scottish tennis pupils, sending congratulations and asking how much he had won. Nothing, Judy told him. \"Ha ha,\" he texted back. \"I won the elevens-and-under at Bridge of Allan on Saturday, and I got \u00a3200.\"</p>"
