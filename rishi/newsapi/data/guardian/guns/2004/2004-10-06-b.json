  "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson will be offered a beefed-up role at Old Trafford by Malcolm Glazer as part of the American tycoon's attempt to reverse fans' hostile reaction to his takeover plans. </p> <p>Glazer and his advisers are understood to have been shocked by the level of opposition from groups such as Shareholders United to their ambition to buy the club. They have identified Ferguson as the only figure at Old Trafford with the power to calm emotions and lead a charm offensive. </p> <p>\"It is definitely the case that the Glazers have a huge regard for Ferguson and they want him to continue as manager and they want him to remain totally involved with the club and be part of its continuing success,\" said one City source. </p> <p>It is not known whether this will extend to Ferguson being offered a seat on the board. However, Glazer hopes to persuade the manager to back what is being described as a \"new model\" of football club ownership. </p> <p>Details are still unclear but its centrepiece is likely to be a type of extended and formal involvement for supporters. It will be presented as a way of generating funds for further investment in the team and the club's infrastructure. </p> <p>\"The Glazers want to run it like a club,\" said the source. \"There have undoubtedly been distractions from running it as a plc. It has not served the interests of Manchester United in recent times. The Glazers love football and they love the club and they are good at sports management.\" </p> <p>Such a message will inevitably be hard to sell in the stands, where the Glazers are regarded as investors solely in pursuit of profit. It would be a huge public relations coup if Ferguson were persuaded to support a takeover by the owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. </p> <p>The intensity of some fans' feelings was demonstrated on Monday night when the United director Maurice Watkins's house and two cars were daubed with red paint. It was seen as the first act by a militant wing of supporters in a \"fight dirty\" campaign to deter Glazer from bidding. </p> <p>By contrast, the American appears increasingly confident of securing financing for his plans and being able to present a formal takeover proposal to the United board, probably next week. </p> <p>The key remains the 29.9% stake owned by JP McManus and John Magnier via their Cubic Expression investment fund. If the Irish duo agree to sell to Glazer, the American is virtually assured of gaining majority control as he already owns 19.3% of United's shares. </p> <p>Neither McManus nor Magnier is thought to have spoken directly to Glazer since United's announcement on Monday of the takeover approach. However, talks between the two parties' advisers, with the US investment bank JP Morgan acting for Glazer, appear to have opened. </p> <p>One source said the Irish have made clear they have no interest in being co-investors with Glazer: if they agree to sell, they will want to be bought out completely for cash. </p> <p>Manchester United's shares yesterday rose 5.5p to 273p -an increase of 2% - as City investors, who on Monday were deeply sceptical of Glazer's chances of success, were persuaded that a takeover is imminent. Some 3.5m United shares changed hands, about 1% of the company. </p> <p>Glazer's attempt to woo fans may also extend to addressing directly two key areas of concern - ticket prices and the transfer budget. Pledges may be made on both issues to try to counter United supporters' arguments that Tampa Bay under Glazer's ownership has a poor record on both. </p> <p>Shareholders United has highlighted the ticket-price rises of 10% at Tampa in the first two seasons after Glazer's $192m (\u00a3107m at current rates) purchase of the franchise nine years ago. He has also been blamed for the team's losing start to the new season less than two years after winning the Super Bowl.</p>",
  "<p>\"Old Trafford might be the Theatre of Dreams but that perennial bid story has finally become a reality. Well, almost,\" said the <strong>Independent</strong>'s Jeremy Warner, after Manchester United confirmed it had been approached by an unnamed potential bidder. </p> <p>Despite the cloak of anonymity, no one appeared to doubt Malcolm Glazer was the mystery bidder. The 76-year-old US businessman - who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team - had been stalking United for more than a year. He recently increased his stake in the club to more than 19%. </p> <p>Neil Collins, in the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>, wondered why anyone would buy a football club. \"The pleasures of winning are fleeting, the criticism from the fans relentless and the opportunities for making a decent return on the investment close to non-existent,\" he said. </p> <p>But the <strong>Wall Street Journal Europe</strong>'s Breaking Views column felt it was time someone made a bid for United. \"For more than 18 months now, a motley crew of rich men have been quietly building big stakes in [the club],\" it said. JP McManus and John Magnier, for example, own almost 29% of the shares. The Irish horseracing tycoons will be \"pivotal\" in any bid, said the <strong>Daily Mail</strong>. \"Analysts reckoned that they will sell if Mr Glazer offers more than \u00a33 a share.\" </p> <p>United's share price jumped more than 5% on Monday, raising the value of the club to \u00a3675m. The price eased 0.55% to 269.5p by the end of Tuesday. Mr Glazer would have to offer between \u00a3700m and \u00a3800m to capture the club, agreed the papers. </p> <p>But if the US businessman is in \"the driving seat, he had better make peace with the fans as soon as he can - even ... Rupert Murdoch found them a handful\", said Stephen Khan in the <strong> Daily Express</strong>, noting the media mogul's failed \u00a3624m bid in 1999. \"It would not do the image of Manchester United as a world brand any favours\" if there were regular matchday demonstrations, he added. </p> <p>Protests were a strong possibility, said the <strong>Manchester Evening News</strong>. \"The Independent Manchester United Supporters Association has warned that 'direct action' will form part of the strategy aimed at preventing the American multi-millionaire from gaining control of the club,\" said the paper. </p> <p>But because of stock exchange rules, the fans can do little to prevent the takeover, explained the Daily Mail. Mr Glazer only needs 50% of United plc plus one share to succeed, and \"UK listing rules allow [him] to cancel shares anyway.\" </p> <p>\"This time [the fans] are unlikely to be helped by the Monopolies Commission,\" said the Independent. The supporters have a right to question whether Mr Glazer is right for United, it added, but \"it is naive of them to reject commercialisation.\" </p> <p>Martin Samuel, in the <strong>Times</strong>, agreed. \"Memo to Manchester United fans: welcome to the free market,\" he wrote. \"No sporting organisation in Britain has so ruthlessly exploited market forces as Manchester United plc. Laissez-faire capitalism has brought them the biggest ground, the most expensive players, a global fanbase and a commercial arm second to none. It made the club the most dominant force and loudest voice in English football,\" but now leaves it vulnerable to takeover, said Samuel. </p> <p>But the Wall Street Journal Europe warned yesterday that Mr Glazer should not ignore the fans. \"Even if only 8% of shareholders vote against the bid, he wouldn't be able to squeeze them out,\" it noted. \"He would be stuck with disgruntled minority. What's more, Manchester United depends on its fans for revenue. Without their purchasing power the soccer club would not be as profitable as it is.\" </p> <p>Mr Glazer still has to woo Mr McManus and Mr Magnier, it continued. \"If Mr Glazer has to pay up to get this speculative pair on board, it might be enough to sway even the greed of the most ardent Manchester United fan.\" </p> <p>But who would be the beneficiaries of the latest takeover speculation? \"The smart money in this soap opera\" is on Mr McManus and Mr Magnier, \"who have outmanoeuvred everyone, and now they seem poised to collect their winnings\", concluded Collins in the Telegraph.</p>",
  "A girl with learning difficulties was found drowned in a swimming pool 15 minutes after teachers had escorted her classmates to the changing rooms, a court heard. <p>Emma Farrar, aged four, was said to have little sense of danger. She wandered into the deep end of the pool at Woodlands school in Blackpool, Lancashire, during a five-minute playtime at the end of a half-hour lesson. </p> <p>It later emerged that supervising staff had failed to count the 11 children as they got out of the pool. </p> <p>They also failed to notice Emma's clothes and dry towel in the changing room. Staff only realised she was missing when a green coat went unclaimed and another child said it belonged to Emma. </p> <p>When paramedics arrived on November 13 2001, staff could not tell them the girl's name or anything about her medical history. </p> <p>Pauline Mills, 55, the swimming instructor, appeared before Preston crown court, charged with manslaughter as a result of gross negligence. She denies the charge. </p> <p>Ms Mills, of Newton, near Kirkham, Lancashire, is also charged with breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. It is alleged she let the children take off their armbands and wander into the deep end; she allowed supervisors to leave the pool early; and she did not do a head count and a perimeter check of the pool. </p> <p>Keith Berry, the former headteacher of the neighbouring Park school, where Emma was a pupil, is charged with breaching health and safety regulations by failing to take reasonable care of others. He denies the charge. </p> <p>Blackpool borough council has pleaded guilty to exposing people not in its employ to health and safety risks. </p> <p>Yesterday the court heard that a support teacher brought in to help supervise the lesson had no training for pool sessions. Amanda Heys was a special support assistant at Park school on the day in question, along with Susan Haley and Julie Barker. </p> <p>Alan Conrad, for the prosecution, asked her: \"Had you ever been given any instructions about what to do if people were drowning and needed help?\" \"No,\" she replied. Mr Conrad said the girl died because of \"gross negligence\" by Ms Mills and because the school's swimming policy was \"grossly deficient\". </p> <p>Miss Heys, whose role was to look after a seven-year-old autistic boy, said panic set in when the body was found 15 minutes after the lesson. </p> <p>She said no one had noticed Emma was missing. \"Somebody picked up a light green coat and asked: 'Whose is this?' One child said: 'That's Emma's coat.' I glanced around for Emma to come forward for her coat, but I couldn't see her,\" she told the court. In the changing room, Emma's clothes were in a neat pile with her towel on top. </p> <p>\"Then Susan Haley opened the gate to the pool, and that's when Emma was found - in the pool. There was panic. But we knew we had to raise the alarm, so we went to the telephone. We were pressing 999, but couldn't get through. I went to the main door and called for Pauline Mills, who immediately went into the pool.\" </p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>A long tunnel lies deep beneath the Jura mountains that straddle the border between France and Switzerland to the west of Geneva. Some of the most important scientific experiments in history have unfolded here, helping scientists to unravel how and why our universe came to exist. </p> <p>But for the last three years, the tunnel has seen more prosaic activity: builders, electricians and plumbers have replaced the physicists, whose experiments have been put on hold while a new multimillion pound machine is squeezed inside. </p> <p>The machine is called a large hadron collider (LHC) and has already caused the scientists working on it sleepless nights as costs spiralled and doubts were raised over whether work would ever be completed. Those problems seem to be behind them now, but a far bigger headache lies ahead. </p> <p>Over the last 50 years, physicists have carefully built the results of their studies of the atom into a theory, a framework that explains how the particles in the universe fit together. As influential as biology's discovery of nat ural selection and as fundamental as chemistry's periodic table, the standard model of particle physics completes a trinity of scientific discoveries. </p> <p>Yet the physicists now building the collider come not to praise the standard model, but to bury it. When the machine opens in 2007, it is expected to provide the first experimental evidence that the model, which has underpinned their entire subject since it was invented, is wrong. </p> <p>\"The LHC is really the key that is bound to unlock the door,\" says John Womersley, a physicist at Fermilab in Chicago. \"The LHC experimentalists are very optimistic that within a year of [it] starting running there, they will have seen data that clearly doesn't fit the standard model.\" </p> <p>The machine will be the crowning achievement of the Cern particle physics laboratory, in Geneva, which has its 50th anniversary this month. When it is switched on, the LHC will act like the world's most powerful microscope: it will accelerate protons around the 27km ring to near the speed of light and then smash them together, releasing energy levels never before seen on Earth. The resulting explosion will tear the protons apart and, it is hoped, give us the deepest understanding yet of what makes up the matter all around us. </p> <p>The standard model is a testament to the simplicity that scientists insist is at the heart of nature: a compact and precise mathematical description of our universe. It was put together once quantum theory (developed by, among others, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Paul Dirac) took off just before the second world war. The model lists the simplest particles that can exist and describes the action of three fundamental forces that act on them: the familiar electromagnetism, and the more esoteric strong and weak forces. </p> <p>But it has never been perfect. </p> <p>As experiments have become more sophisticated and physicists have been able to delve deeper into the actual constituents of matter, the standard model has had to fight off a barrage of problems with sometimes clunky mathematical fixes. One hole in particular seems to resist all attempts at fudges or fixes: the omission of the fourth fundamental force, gravity. </p> <p>By far the most damaging blow to the model has come, in the past decade, from outer space. </p> <p>\"The thing that has had the biggest impact is much better astronomical measurements about dark matter and dark energy,\" says Womersley. As as tronomers discovered stuff out in space that made up 95% of the mass of the universe but was not described by their standard model, they knew its days were numbered. All they are waiting for to abandon the model completely is direct evidence from experiments they control. That is why they believe that the LHC will be the final nail in the standard model's coffin. </p> <p>In the same way that the quantum revolution of the early 20th century showed that Isaac Newton's classical physics was not wrong but just good approximation that applied in the everyday experience, physicists will soon show that their subject, represented by the standard model, looks only at part of the picture. </p> <p>\"If you talk to people now, you get the sense that we're in the middle of that overturning,\" says Womersley. \"It's like watching a building collapse in slow motion.\" </p> <p>For some time, the malaise affecting the standard model spilled over into the practicalities of building the LHC, a project that aims fundamentally to change physics has already brought sweeping changes to Cern itself. </p> <p>The LHC was conceived in the 1980s, at a time when Cern was still constructing the standard model and was working to fill in the remaining blanks. That was to be job of a different atom-smashing machine, the large electron positron collider (LEP), but Cern scientists were already thinking further ahead. The LHC was approved in 1994, and was to be built in the tunnel that housed the LEP, when that experiment came to the end of its useful life. </p> <p>Work on the LHC began in 2000, but a review of project in 2001 revealed se rious trouble. \"We found that there was going to be an 18% over-run,\" says Lyn Evans, the LHC project manager at Cern. At the time, this translated to the lab needing an extra 500m Swiss francs to finish a project originally expected to cost SFr2.6bn (\u00a31.1bn). </p> <p>The problems lay mainly in the lower-tech end of the project: civil engineers found water leaking into the vast cavities being excavated for new experimental areas. </p> <p>The huge superconducting magnets needed for the LHC's detectors also turned out to be much more expensive than predicted. Budget cuts at the lab in preceding decades, and the resulting downsizing of technical staff, meant that there were also extra costs in hiring people to install LHC equipment. Worse still, Cern had no contingency funds to cover the extra costs. </p> <p>Europe's flagship scientific lab was facing the biggest challenge in its history. \"The crisis was created by the way it was handled,\" says Evans. \"You do not give bad news without giving solutions.\" </p> <p>The management immediately ordered scientists at the lab to tighten their belts while it pleaded for more cash from Cern's member countries to finish the project. The requests were turned down, meaning that Cern had to make drastic cuts. </p> <p>\"Ninety per cent of the Cern budget is focused on LHC now. It was something like 70% before,\" says Evans. It was the only way to save the LHC, and possibly even Cern itself, from being shut down. </p> <p>Three years on, he says that Cern's scientists can finally put the financial crisis behind them. Their next problem is how to fill the theoretical vacuum created by the imminent demise of the standard model. And right now, that is anybody's guess. </p> <p>The most popular candidate is something called supersymmetry. </p> <p>In the standard model, the electron is one of the fundamental particles. The model also describes its anti-matter equivalent, the positron. In supersymmetry, there would be two further related particles - the selectron and the anti-selectron. They would have the same electric charge as the more familiar particles but would have a much greater mass. </p> <p>\"If the ideas are correct, what you would expect to find is a whole zoo of particles, which are the supersymmetric partners of the ones we've seen,\" says Graham Ross, a theoretical physicist at Oxford University. </p> <p>Supersymmetric particles may account for some of the dark matter in the universe - dark because the particles do not \"shine\" energy that we can see. These particles could have congregated into huge clusters (much like conventional particles congregated to form stars) but did not undergo fusion and are therefore unable to emit radiation. </p> <p>Another idea lining up the standard model's place is extra dimensions. \"One of the more bizarre ideas is that the world may only look 3D at low energy scales,\" says Womersley. \"What you might see at the LHC is particles starting to move in additional dimensions of space, which would be truly bizarre.\" </p> <p>We can't see these extra dimensions, the story goes, because they are tightly curled up, like a hosepipe. </p> <p>\"From a distance they look like a line but if you come closer, you can see that it's actually got a dimension,\" says Ross. </p> <p>One reason that scientists take the concept of extra dimensions seriously is because of string theory, or the modern version known as M-theory. Mathematically, M-theory only makes sense in at least 10 dimensions. </p> <p>Extra dimensions could also tackle a gaping hole of modern physics: that gravity is excluded from the standard model. The extra dimensions idea says that gravity - the weakest of the fundamental forces - may exist properly as a strong force in an as yet undiscovered dimension. We experience it as weak because only part of its strength trickles into our world. </p> <p>Finally, there is technicolour. While the notion of supersymmetry takes the same familiar forces of nature and adds extra particles, technicolour invokes a bizarre fundamental force that we have not yet detected. It says, for example, that quarks, the constituents of protons and neutrons, are not single particles but a complex of smaller particles called techniquarks. </p> <p>Which of the three, if any, is correct? Scientists are already gathering evidence. </p> <p>\"We're looking for the production of superparticles in our accelerator,\" says Womersley. \"The way you do this is to look for rare collision. What we're searching for is anomalously high-energy production because that would come from the decays of new, more massive, undiscovered particles.\" </p> <p>Just a few months ago, scientists at Fermilab spotted one such anomalous high-energy event in their Tevatron, which is currently the world's most powerful particle accelerator. Had they seen evidence of a superparticle? Womersley is cautious, saying that one event doesn't prove anything. He is now on the lookout for more. </p> <p>The LHC will run at much higher energies than the Tevatron, so its chances of finding elusive superparticles, evidence of a new force or extra dimensions are much greater. </p> <p>All these ideas for the new physics represent something really very radical. Even supersymmetry, currently the scientists' favourite to take on the role of the new standard model, is a great leap into the unknown. When physicists were putting the original standard model together during the past 50 years, they knew largely where they were heading; they were confident that the particles they predicted would be found eventually. </p> <p>\"Supersymmetry is a different character,\" says Ross. \"I consider it to be much speculative than what went before. If it should prove to be the case, it will be a wonderful realisation of human imagination.\" </p> <p>And, already, scientists are looking beyond the LHC. Plans for an international linear collider are already on the drawing board. </p> <p>\"At the LHC, you will tend to produce all of the particles all at once, mixed together - the disadvantage is trying to untangle it. It's like trying to work out the ingredients of a soup when you're eating everything mixed together,\" says Womersley. \"The linear collider has the capability of tuning the polarisation and energy to produce the particles one by one.\" </p> <p>With the LHC, the linear collider and the inevitable experiments that will follow, scientists could find the answers to questions about the basic building blocks of nature that have plagued them for almost a century. Or they could just raise more questions. </p> <p><strong>Rise and fall of a scientific theory</strong></p> <p> <strong>1905:</strong> Einstein publishes his theory of the wave-particle duality of light and establishes one of the foundations for quantum mechanics. By 1933, Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky hypothesises the existence of dark matter.</p> <p><strong>1964-67:</strong> Quarks, the fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons, are proposed by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig. They are found experimentally five years later. Steven Weinberg, Sheldon Glashow and Abdus Salam (right) unify the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force. They win the Nobel prize for physics in 1979. </p> <p><strong>1970-73:</strong> The standard model of particle physics is developed. Physicists put everything they know about fundamental particles into a neat mathematical description. The model predicts the existence of further particles, which will be discovered over the next 25 years. There is a hole, however: the model does not include gravity.</p> <p><strong>1974-1985:</strong> Scientists start finding the particles proposed by the standard model including the charm and bottom quarks and the tau lepton. Carlo Rubbia discovers the predicted W and Z bosons, which carry the weak force, using the Super Proton Synchrotron, a particle accelerator formed in a 7km circumference ring.</p> <p><strong>1995-2000:</strong> Scientists in Chicago find the top quark and the tau neutrino. The only predicted particle left still to be discovered is the Higgs boson </p> <p><strong>2003:</strong> By studying microwave radiation left over from the big bang, scientists discover that 95% of the matter in the universe does not fit the standard model.

  "<p>The cycle of violence is built into mammalian brains, according to the latest issue of Behavioural Neuroscience. Scientists from Holland and Hungary have identified a fast, mutual positive feedback loop between stress hormones and a brain aggression control centre in rats. </p> <p>They tested 53 rats in five experiments and found that if they stimulated the brain's aggression mechanism, they raised stress hormone levels. And if they raised hormone levels, the aggression centre went into overdrive. This would, they say, explain why aggressive behaviour escalates so easily, and why a hard day at the office could end in domestic violence. </p> <p>\"These stress hormones, in part by mobilising energy reserves, prepare the physiology of the body to fight or flee during stress,\" said Menno Kruk of the Leiden/Amsterdam Centre for Drug Research. \"Now it appears these very same hormones talk back to the brain in order to facilitate fighting.\" </p>",

  "The final part of the Disability Discrimination Act, which came into force last week, is fundamentally flawed (Report, October 1). It ignores the needs of people who are profoundly disabled and in the greatest need of liberating legislation. Discrimination legislation, which seeks to ensure that a disadvantaged group can enjoy equal treatment, assumes that a degree of homogeneity exists within the disadvantaged group. But this is not true for those who have a profound and multiple disability. The legislators have failed to address their needs. <p>There is a low awareness of people with profound levels of disability, although there are probably more than 100,000 of these people in the UK. A better understanding could be gained by trying to put ourselves into the life of a profoundly disabled person. We would endure almost constant deprivation of stimulus, communication would be extremely difficult but, more importantly, rarely would anyone have the time, expertise or inclination to build a relationship. That the needs of the most vulnerable people are treated in such an inhuman manner is unacceptable. We at Parity for Disability cannot accept that Part III is the final part of the DDA; that will only come with legislation that guarantees quality of life for people with profound disabilities and provides protected funding to achieve it. <br> <b>Paul Roper</b> <br> Chair, Parity for Disability </p> <p>While the Disability Rights Commission warned that 80% of Britain's high-street business premises do not comply with the DDA, organisations need to understand that barriers to access are not only physical. </p> <p>Websites are cyber shopfronts and people with sensory disabilities often get products and services online. Customers could argue that organisations have not made appropriate reasonable adjustments by following simple guidelines for web accessibility.

  "<p>Where are we going? The long-term trends are clear. We're heading rapidly towards a world of small intelligent wireless devices ... but not a single type of device. </p> <p>The first and most important trend is for the computer industry to engulf and devour everything else. Serious electronic computing started with ideas such as calculating the trajectories of artillery shells. Processing numbers took us through stock control and payroll, then into word processing. Serious graphics that started with computer-aided design took us through desktop publishing to photorealistic graphics, desktop video and digital television. Speech and music were synthesised and digitised along the way. </p> <p>As Nicholas Negroponte, founder of the MIT Media Lab, has pointed out, the world of atoms is being replaced by a world of bits - the binary digits of computing. </p> <p>The second trend is for speciation. As the computer ecology gets bigger and richer, it can support more types of devices aimed at more specialised niches. For example, you can get Windows PCs in formats ranging from pocketables to mainframe class systems via an incredible variety of notebooks, portables, desktops and deskside servers. </p> <p>The phone industry is being absorbed into the computer industry. Phones are increasingly using computer processors (mainly the old Acorn ARM chip) and computer operating systems from Symbian (Psion), Palm or Microsoft, or Linux, while the old phone networks are replaced by packets of data being sent from computer to computer (Voice over Internet Protocol, VoIP). </p> <p>This absorption is stimulating a sort of Cambrian explosion of new phones with or without keyboards, cameras, radios, music players and, eventually, built-in TV sets. Similar developments are taking place in the media industries with music and video playback devices that are also, from a technical point of view, just dedicated computers. </p> <p>The third trend is for power to move from the centre to the edge of the network. We used to live in a world were networks were big and powerful and the devices were dumb: think of a TV set, or a black Bakelite phone. Today, the power is in the devices that are attached to the network - the smart phones and TiVo-style television set-top boxes - while the networks are becoming much less powerful. </p> <p>Indeed, people increasingly want their devices to be physically detached from the network - ie wireless - and able to connect to multiple networks at once. Think of replacing one wire with Bluetooth, GPS, GSM, Wi-Fi, WiMax, DAB and digital television. </p> <p>I think these three trends are irreversible, because they all increase the user's capabilities. People are not going to relinquish their new powers willingly, if at all. </p> <p>Every few years there are campaigns for things like \"utility computing\", where companies want to move all the power back to the centre, leaving users with the equivalent of dumb terminals. In some ways it is an attractive idea, but I'll believe in it when millions of people start giving up their cars and go back to public transport. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Send comment to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@theguardian.com\"> online.feedback@theguardian.com</a>.

  "Iraq's insurgency spread to a relatively calm area near the Syrian border yesterday when a suicide car bomber killed at least 16 people at an Iraqi National Guard centre. <p>As US and Iraqi forces extended efforts to restore security in rebel-held regions ahead of January elections, the western settlement of Ana became the latest town to be sucked into the violence. </p> <p>Witnesses said a car sped towards the military garrison on the edge of the town where recruits were applying to join the National Guard, and exploded. Doctors said 16 people had been killed and 24 wounded. </p> <p>Ana is west of the notorious Sunni triangle, where many of the rebel attacks outside Baghdad have been staged. US and Iraqi forces persisted with counter-insurgency operations yesterday, turning their attention to an insurgent stronghold south of Baghdad that includes the troublespot towns of Mahmudiya, Yusufiya and Latifiya. </p> <p>Joint forces rounded up 160 suspects, seized a suspected training camp and took control of a bridge on the first day of the assault in the area, the US command said. The bridge is believed to be a favoured corridor linking insurgent areas around Baghdad, Falluja and towns further south. </p> <p>Elsewhere, a roadside bomb exploded in Basra as a British patrol was crossing a bridge, killing one Iraqi and injuring 10 others, police said. There were no reports of British casualties. A Kurdish tribal leader and a companion were shot dead in the northern city of Mosul. </p> <p>The wave of violence has raised questions about January's elections, but the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, told a Baghdad audience yesterday that it was only part of the story. \"There is another story going on of the new Iraq seeking to break out of the oppression and tyranny of Saddam and also from the oppression and tyranny of the terrorists.\" </p> <p>A deal with rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr to bring peace to the eastern Baghdad slum known as Sadr City remained elusive meanwhile, though both sides hinted at progress. </p> <p>Under one tentative plan, militia fighters loyal to the influential cleric would turn in their weapons in exchange for cash and immunity for most fighters from prosecution. </p> <p>Iraqi police would take over security responsibilities in Sadr City and American forces would only enter the district with the approval of Iraqi authorities. </p> <p>But the prime minister, Ayad Allawi, said there was no ceasefire yet in the weeks-long battle for the neighbourhood. </p> <p>\"We responded positively to the request of the people of Sadr City,\" he said. \"They will surrender their weapons to the authorities. They will dismantle any armed presence in the city. They will respect and abide by the rule of law in the city. They will welcome the police to go back, patrol the streets of the city.\"</p>",
  "Ariel Sharon's chief aide caused a political storm yesterday by claiming that the real purpose of the Israeli prime minister's \"disengagement plan\" was to freeze the peace process and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, all with the blessing of the US. <p>Dov Weisglass, Mr Sharon's chief of staff and point man in negotiations with the White House, boasted that he had won an agreement from the Americans for Israel to keep almost all Jewish settlers in the West Bank. </p> <p>Swiftly seeking to defuse the row created by Mr Weisglass's comments, Mr Sharon said he remained committed to the US-led road map as \"the only plan that can permit progress toward a durable political settlement\". </p> <p>But the celebratory tone of Mr Weisglass's remarks confirmed suspicions among Palestinian leaders and some on the Israeli left that Mr Sharon's strategy has been to kill the possibility of a negotiated peace so that he could impose an emasculated and semi-autonomous Palestinian homeland on terms he could not hope to win by agreement. </p> <p>In an interview with the Ha'aretz newspaper, Mr Weisglass said that Mr Sharon's plan to withdraw settlers from the Gaza strip while expanding Jewish settlements on the West Bank was designed to freeze the peace process. </p> <p>\"When you freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and you prevent a discussion on the refugees, the borders and Jerusalem,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Effectively, this whole package called the Palestinian state, with all that it entails, has been removed indefinitely from our agenda. And all this with authority and permission. All with a presidential blessing and the ratification of both houses of Congress.\" </p> <p>Mr Sharon portrays his unilateral plan as a reluctant initiative undertaken because the peace process had stalled and he could find no negotiating partner on the Palestinian side. </p> <p>But Mr Weisglass said the Israeli prime minister's strategy was to prevent any such negotiation. </p> <p>\"The disengagement is actually formaldehyde,\" he said. \"It supplies the amount of formaldehyde that is necessary so there will not be a political process with the Palestinians.\" </p> <p>Under the disengagement plan, Mr Sharon says he intends to remove about 7,500 Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip and a few hundred more from four small settlements in the north of the West Bank. </p> <p>Mr Weisglass said that would mean that 190,000 settlers in the rest of the West Bank, in addition to those in East Jerusalem, \"will not be moved from their place\". </p> <p>\"What I effectively agreed to with the Americans was that part of the settlements would not be dealt with at all, and the rest will not be dealt with until the Palestinians turn into Finns. That is the significance of what we did,\" he said. </p> <p>In August George Bush broke with decades of US policy by agreeing that West Bank Jewish settlements, illegal under international law, would eventually become part of Israel. </p> <p>Mr Weisglass's comments appear to be aimed at placating right-wing opponents of Mr Sharon's disengagement plan by assuring them that he has outmanoeuvred the Palestinians and that there will be no Palestinian state. </p> <p>But the interview brought criticism from Palestinians and some Israelis. </p> <p>Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and leader of the opposition Labour party, warned that such a strategy would not bring peace. \"He who seeks half peace will bring half war,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p>The former Israeli cabinet minister and author of the Geneva peace initiative, Yossi Beilin, said Mr Weisglass's \"frightening comments\" revealed Mr Sharon's true intentions. \"They reveal the fact that it is Sharon who is not a peace partner, and the peace camp must work for him to be overthrown,\" he said. </p> <p>An Arab Israeli member of parliament, Ahmed Tibi, sent a letter to the US ambassador asking \"if the American administration is a partner to Sharon's political deceit, which Weisglass revealed with incriminating candour\".</p>",
  "Police were castigated yesterday for delaying more than an hour before attending an incident where a man shot dead his estranged wife and her sister and seriously injured their mother. All three lay wounded while frantic neighbours tried to give them first aid. <p>Vicky Horgan, 27, died shortly after a drunken Stuart Horgan, 39, shot her in the head with a .410 shotgun after bursting in on a barbecue at her home in Highmoor Cross, near Henley-on-Thames, in Oxfordshire, on June 6. </p> <p>Her 25-year-old sister, Emma Walton, was shot in the back and died later in hospital. Their mother was in a coma for two weeks but survived. </p> <p>But despite numerous 999 calls from neighbours, one of whom demanding police and ambulance response more than 50 times while giving a 70-minute running commentary on the horrific scene, armed officers did not arrive for 64 minutes after the first 999 call. It was 87 minutes before paramedics, awaiting police assurance it was safe, attended the wounded, even though it was fairly certain the gunman had fled in the first 22 minutes. </p> <p>A Home Office pathologist said Vicky Horgan would not have lived, and it was \"highly unlikely\" Ms Walton would have survived even if she had received immediate medical attention. But he conceded that had a specialist been available there was the \"slimmest of possibilities that Ms Walton's life could have been saved.\" </p> <p>An internal review of the Thames Valley force's role, overseen by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, said there was no justification for the delay, and criticised a catalogue of failure. These included poor decision-making, delay in passing command of the situation to a specialist firearms officer, confusion in the control room and over the emergency services' rendezvous point. </p> <p>Peter Neyroud, Thames Valley chief constable, apologised to the victims' family and local people, and he paid tribute to neighbours, Roy and Georgina Gibson, who called the police and nursed the victims. Vicky Horgan died in Mrs Gibson's arms, and it was a letter from a furious Mr Gibson which sparked the police inquiry. </p> <p>He said: \"We could have and should have been faster to the scene to protect the wounded and the public of Highmoor Cross. I regret very much the distress which the additional delay caused to the victims and witnesses.\" </p> <p>But Mr Neyroud and Detective Superintendent Mick Tighe, author of the review, said no individual officer was to blame. </p> <p>Instead, they claimed the fiasco was due to failings in training and national policy, which emphasises locating the perpetrator rather than getting to the victims. \"The weaknesses identified ... are fundamental issues for Thames Valley police and possibly the police service nationally.\" </p> <p>Mr Neyroud admitted police had been overcautious, but said this stemmed from criticism of past incidents where armed officers had shot members of the public. He outlined measures he is putting in place to ensure this never happens again. </p> <p>Although Horgan, who had a history of domestic violence, was quickly flagged up as a suspect, police held back, fearing, Mr Neyroud said, another Hungerford, the Berkshire town where the gunman Michael Ryan shot dead 16 people and injured 14 before killing himself in 1987. Even when Mr Gibson assured them Horgan had left, they still refused to move in. And they might have delayed even longer had a plainclothes detective, acting on his own initiative, not stopped on his way to work and radioed to colleagues that the gunman was gone. </p> <p>Horgan was arrested the next day, 100 miles away in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. On June 20 he killed himself by slashing his throat while on remand in Woodhill prison, Milton Keynes, four days after being taken off suicide watch. </p> <p>Yesterday, Mr Gibson, 70, and his wife, Georgina, 58, packing up to leave their home, said they could not bear to stay. Mr Gibson, who demanded a personal explanation from the Thames Valley chief constable in his letter, said he was satisfied police had admitted their mistakes. \"We have seen the report and police have not tried to cover anything up,\" he said yesterday. Of the day of the murders, he remembered: \"My wife was cradling Vicky, telling her help was on its way. But it wasn't. She died 45 minutes after we got to her.\" </p> <p><b> How time was lost</b><br></p> <p><b> Sunday, June 6, 2004</b> <b>4.35pm </b> Stuart Horgan climbs over garden fence of house in Highmoor Cross, Oxfordshire, where estranged wife, Vicky Horgan, is having a barbecue.

  "The European commission warned Turkey yesterday that it would break off entry negotiations if EU ministers found evidence of a \"serious and persistent\" breach of democratic and human rights. <p>The commission effectively gave Turkey the amber light for the start of accession talks, probably in the first half of next year, but only after expressing profound misgivings about violations of freedom. </p> <p>The 30 commissioners from 25 countries agreed to negotiations which could last until as late as 2019. To assuage some members openly hostile to Turkish membership, the commissioners said talks could be suspended by a qualified majority within the council of ministers. The commission offered no guarantee to Turkey that entry was assured. </p> <p>\"There was no vote and [no] unanimity, but there was a consensus,\" one EU source said. EU officials brushed aside suggestions that a proposal to insert a permanent safeguard clause, curbing economic migration to other EU countries, meant that the mainly Muslim country was being offered second-class membership. </p> <p>Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the prime minister, said in Strasbourg that he was confident EU leaders would agree at their December summit formally to open talks early next year. But he demanded the same rules as other candidates, and criticised the offer's conditional nature: \"If negotiations are suspended this would show a lack of respect for Turkey's democratisation process and would conflict with the EU's own principles.\" </p> <p>He lambasted the French president, Jacques Chirac, for promising a referendum on membership amid growing fears in Brussels that other countries would follow suit, effectively vetoing entry. </p> <p>In contrast to France, the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, who arrives for talks in Ankara today, said Turkey had undergone remarkable changes: \"The EU must now deliver its side of the bargain.\" </p> <p>Ankara's moderate Islamic government has staked all on EU membership for the impoverished country of 70 million. The foreign minister, Abdullah Gul, played down suggestions talks could be disrupted. </p> <p>\"Theoretically, there is such a possibility; but I believe it is impossible that something like that could happen,\" he said. </p> <p>The commission hopes the process of entry negotiations will buttress reform in Turkey and produce a positive outcome in any popular votes. With opposition growing in France and Germany to Turkey's candidacy, Romano Prodi, the outgoing commission president, spoke of the need to allay public fears that membership would radically alter the EU and flood it with immigrant labour. One diplomat favouring entry said: \"Safeguards on migration are simply throwing a bone to the Islamophobes which don't add up to anything; but if that's the price for agreeing to entry talks, it's worth paying ... It's just an insurance policy designed not to be used.\" </p> <p>Mr Prodi also warned Turkey \"much remains to be done\" in making good legislative promises to guarantee democratic and human rights despite \"clearly visible pro gress\", and pointed to \"still some blurred areas\". </p> <p>His aides said that, for the first time, a candidate would be judged on enacted reforms that prove irreversible, not just policy or legislation. </p> <p>A political assessment of how far Turkey had gone to meet the political entry criteria said it needed to consolidate and broaden reforms, especially \"zero tolerance policy in the fight against torture and ill-treatment\", measures to guarantee freedom of expression and religion, and rights of women, unions and minorities, especially the Kurds. </p> <p>G\u00fcnter Verheugen, the enlargement commissioner, told MEPs there were individual cases of infringement and abuse but the government \"does seem to be doing what it can to stop this practice\". The commission found no evidence of systematic torture and said some perpetrators had been punished, but called for further efforts. </p> <p>Hans-Gert Poettering, the leader of the conservative European People's party and a Christian Democrat, said this was \"the biggest nonsense of 2004\" and ignored the reality in Turkey's jails. Entry would fundamentally alter the EU, he warned; there were, he said, three not two options available: membership, non-membership, and \"privileged partnership\". </p> <p>Mr Prodi said Turkey could make a positive contribution but its sheer size and make-up, including its economy, called for \"clear precautions\" to \"prevent Turkey's integration from weakening the structure we have been building for more than 50 years\". </p> <p>The assessment lowered estimates of cost to the EU budget, previously put at up to \u20ac28bn (\u00a319.4bn) a year. </p> <p>The Turkish media was generally upbeat at the outcome. Commentators said it would help democratise the country, in turn weakening the role of the military. </p> <p>\"The harsh conditions are in my opinion a safety valve to dilute the reaction of those countries, like France, that are negative to Turkey's EU accession. Basically for Turkey the report said everything that one would want,\" said a political scientist, Ahmet Evin. </p> <p><b>What's in it for the union?</b></p> <p><b> For</b> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> EU credibility is at stake.

  "<p>Sterling's trade-weighted index closed last night at its lowest level for more than eight months - and no wonder. The mood in the City has turned bearish, with a sense that the economy is coming off the boil so quickly that interest rates may well have peaked. </p> <p>This looks like a good call. Imagine that you are a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, concerned about the medium-term outlook for inflation. A couple of months ago everything seemed to be going well. Rates had been pushed up five times, and further increases in November and in February 2005 were in the market. </p> <p>Since the summer, however, there has been little to justify a further tightening. Sure, yesterday's Halifax index showed a 1.4% increase in house prices last month, but the figure was laughed off - rightly so - by the City. Perhaps a more telling indicator of consumer sentiment was that new car sales last month were 2% down against the same month a year ago. </p> <p>Survey evidence - for both manufacturing and services - points to a slowdown in activity over the coming months as dearer borrowing costs and the \"soft spot\" in the global economy affect demand. </p> <p>Some moderation in the rate of growth was foreseen by the Bank of England in its August inflation report, but not this quickly. Moreover, the effects of higher interest rates have yet to have their full impact, since those who took out two-year fixes when rates hit rock bottom in 2003 will only start to feel the pain next year. </p> <p>True, the labour market is tight, and there is a risk that pay bargainers may push for higher wage settlements as compensation for higher petrol prices. </p> <p>But this won't show up this month or next, and in the interim inflation is below its target and growth is at - or even below - trend. </p> <p>As such, the chances of a rate rise this year are now slim. Indeed, the next move could well be down. </p> <p><strong> Google gobbles </strong> </p> <p>Everybody directly involved was doing their damnedest yesterday to play down news that Google is going into the retail book trade. Or rather that it is offering its services as a new electronic interface between book buyers and sellers. </p> <p>Google's typically open-armed style in such matters - in this case promising that publishers and retailers of all shapes and sizes will be welcomed into the new Google Print community - may well be good news for the publish ing industry generally, helping to generate fresh interest in the traditional printed word. Also, few analysts see any substantive impact on Amazon's position as the web's king of books. </p> <p>But somebody, somewhere, will end up paying for Google's listings - and with the intense price competitiveness that the internet brings, the betting is that it will not be the consumer. </p> <p>Established businesses in all sorts of sectors are looking at Google and wondering whether its a friend or a foe. Its position as the effective gateway to the web gives it, in some form or another, the ability to take a tiny clip from every cyber coin spent. </p> <p>During the boom, e-missionaries such as John Chambers of Cisco used to talk about stodgy old companies in each and every commercial sector getting Amazoned. </p> <p>He was only partially right at the time, but the march of technology has given us a similar, albeit more subtle, verb. Google News did it to newspapers, Wall Street got a taste during Google's flotation. Now that publishing has been Googled, it will be interesting to see who is next. </p> <p><strong> Rapture revisited </strong> </p> <p>Try to read the following without scoffing: \"Britain now has a number of beacons of hope in the fight against fraud, reminiscent of New York's success in reversing a supposedly unstoppable wave of law-breaking in the 1990s. Too many people said it couldn't be done. Mayor Giuliani proved it could and now a string of UK initiatives are setting a similar example on economic crime. There's too much unthinking pessimism. There is nothing inevitable about fraud. Insight and initiative can turn the tide.\" </p> <p>This is Ros Wright, the former director of the Serious Fraud Office, speaking in her new guise as chair of the Fraud Advisory Panel, an \"independent watchdog\" funded by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &amp; Wales. </p> <p>The panel is keen, in its annual review published yesterday, to highlight three aspects to \"getting it right\". </p> <p>1) High-level strategic thinking. The response to fraud needs \"a holistic strategy rather than through piecemeal initiatives\". </p> <p>2) Police-business partnerships. \"Much closer cooperation between the police and business is essential. Law enforcement can never do everything by itself.\" </p> <p>3) Cultural change. \"Long-term fraud reduction also depends on informing, training and motivating all employees. Economic crime is too widespread to be tackled only by a few specialists.\" </p> <p>\"Of course fraud is very far from disappearing,\" Mrs Wright added, \"so our rapture is modified. Progress has been made but it needs to be consolidated and built on.\" </p> <p>Our rapture remains non-existent.</p>",
  "My first run-in with Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army came on March 31 in Baghdad. The US occupation chief Paul Bremer had just sent armed men to shut down the young cleric's newspaper, al-Hawza, on the grounds that articles comparing Bremer to Saddam Hussein incited violence against Americans. Sadr responded by calling for his supporters to protest outside the gates of the Green Zone, demanding al-Hawza's reopening. <p>I wanted to go, but there was a problem; I had been visiting state factories all day and I wasn't dressed for a crowd of devout Shias. Then again, I reasoned, this was a demonstration in defence of journalistic freedom - could they really object to a journalist in loose trousers? I put on a headscarf and headed over. </p> <p>Demonstrators had printed up English-language banners that said \"Let Journalists Work With No Terror\". That sounded good, I thought, and started doing my work. I was soon interrupted, however, by a black-clad member of the Mahdi army: he wanted to talk to my translator about my fashion choices. The situation quickly got serious - another Mahdi soldier grabbed my translator and shoved him against a wall, injuring his back. Meanwhile, an Iraqi friend called to say she was trapped inside the Green Zone and couldn't leave: she had forgotten a headscarf and was afraid of running into a Mahdi patrol. </p> <p>It was an instructive lesson about who Sadr actually is: not an anti-imperialist liberator, as some have cast him, but someone who wants foreigners out so that he can control large portions of Iraq's population himself. But neither is Sadr the one-dimensional villain painted by the media, a portrayal that has allowed many liberals to stay silent as he is barred from participating in elections and to look the other way as US forces firebomb Sadr City. </p> <p>The situation requires a more principled position. For instance, Sadr deserves his right to publish a political newspaper - not because he believes in freedom but because we supposedly do. Similarly, Sadr's calls for fair elections and an end to occupation demand our unequivocal support - not because we are blind to the threat Sadr poses but because a belief in self-determination means admitting that the outcome of democracy is not ours to control. </p> <p>These distinctions are commonly made in Iraq: many people I met in Baghdad condemned the attacks on Sadr as evidence that Washington never intended to bring democracy. They backed Sadr's calls for an end to occupation and immediate elections. But when asked if they would vote for him, most laughed. </p> <p>Yet in North America and Europe the idea that you can support Sadr's call for fair elections and an end to occupation without endorsing him as Iraq's next prime minister has proved harder to grasp. For arguing this position, I was accused of making \"excuses for the theocrats and misogynists\" by Nick Cohen, in the Observer, and of being a \"socialist-feminist offering swooning support to theocratic fascists\" by Christopher Hitchens, in Slate. </p> <p>All this manly defence of women's rights is enough to make a girl swoon. Yet it's worth remembering how Hitchens rationalised his reputation-destroying support for the war: even if US forces were really after the oil and military bases, he reasoned, the liberation of the Iraqi people would be such a joyous side-effect that progressives everywhere should cheer. With the prospect of liberation still a cruel joke, Hitchens now claims that this anti-woman, anti-gay White House is the Iraqi people's best hope against Sadr's anti-woman, anti-gay fundamentalism. Once again we are supposed to hold our noses and cheer the Bradleys for the greater good, or the lesser evil. There is no question that Iraqis face a mounting threat from religious fanaticism, but US forces won't protect Iraqi women and minorities any more than they have protected Iraqis from torture in Abu Ghraib or bombs in Falluja. Liberation will never be a trickle-down effect of this invasion because domination, not liberation, was always its goal. </p> <p>The choice in Iraq is not between Sadr's dangerous fundamentalism - echoed by some Sunni groups - and a secular, democratic government made up of trade unionists and feminists. It's between open elections - which risk handing power to fundamentalists but would also allow secular and more progressive religious forces to organise - and rigged elections designed to leave Iraq in the hands of Ayad Allawi and his CIA/Mukhabarat-trained thugs, dependent on Washington for both money and might. </p> <p>This is why Sadr is being hunted - not because he is a threat to women's rights but because his political demands represent the greatest threat to US control. Even after Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani backed down from his opposition to the handover plans, Sadr continued to oppose the US-drafted constitution, continued to call for the withdrawal of foreign troops and continued to oppose US plans to appoint an interim government rather than hold elections. If Sadr's demands are met and the country left in the hands of the majority, US military bases will be in jeopardy, as will Bremer's privatisation-friendly laws. </p> <p>Progressives should oppose the attack on Sadr because it is an attack on the possibility of a democratic future. There is another reason to defend his democratic rights: paradoxically, it will help to stem religious fundamentalism's rise. </p> <p>Sadr has deftly positioned himself not as the narrow voice of strict Shias but as an Iraqi nationalist defending the entire country against foreign invaders. Thus, when he was attacked with the full force of the US military and dared to resist, he earned the respect of millions of Iraqis living under the brutality of occupation. </p> <p>This shift in attitude is evident in all the polling. A coalition provisional authority poll conducted in May, after the first US siege of Najaf, found that 81% of Iraqi respondents now thought more highly of Sadr. An Iraq Centre for Research and Strategic Studies poll ranked Sadr - a marginal figure six months before - as Iraq's second most influential political player after Sistani. </p> <p>Most alarming, the attacks appear to be boosting support not only for Sadr personally, but for theocracy generally. In February, the month before Bremer closed down Sadr's newspaper, an Oxford Research International survey found that a majority of Iraqis wanted a secular government; only 21% of respondents said that their favoured political system was \"an Islamic state\". Fast-forward to August, with Najaf under siege by US forces: the International Republican Institute reported that a staggering 70% of Iraqis wanted Islam and sharia as the basis of the state. The poll didn't differentiate between Sadr's unyielding interpretation of sharia and moderate versions. Yet it's clear that some of the people who told me in March that they supported Sadr but would never vote for him are beginning to change their minds. </p> <p>I recently received a letter from Major Glen Butler, a US marine helicopter pilot stationed in Najaf. Major Butler defended the siege on the holy city by saying that he and his fellow marines were trying to prevent the \"evil\" of \"radical Muslims\" from spreading. Well, it's not working. Helicopter gunships are good at killing people. Beliefs, when under fire, tend to spread. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> An earlier version of this column was published in The Nation </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thenation.com\">www.thenation.com</a></p>",
  "'Bummers,\" the bloke in the pub shouted. \"You bum him and he bums you.\" It took a few minutes to realise he was looking, pointing, shouting - and miming sexual congress by gyrating his hips - at me and my mate Ian. Like pigs in a trough, his eight mates grunted and ploughed on with their Saturday afternoon lunch in Soho, while our man warmed to his theme. <p>\"Bummers.\" He made eye contact with us, something of an achievement given the amount of booze coursing through his bloodstream. \"Fair play to you. But it's not natural, is it?\" </p> <p>As any victim of abuse does, I took a good long hard look at myself to see what I had done to deserve this tirade. Clearly, I was asking for it: I was wearing a purple paisley shirt and was supping a pint of orange juice at 3pm. Ian, for his sins, was sporting slightly long hair and drinking a cappuccino. </p> <p>This visitor to London, a 30-something bloke, was in the gay capital of the country, and we were a confirmation of everything he expected to see. As Ian said, the man's behaviour was, to put it very mildly, slightly odd: a bit like a tourist travelling to Lagos and hurling racist abuse at the locals. </p> <p>Later that evening I was strolling home, again through Soho, with another mate, Dave. \"Fucking faggots,\" an 18-year-old bloke walking with his girlfriend muttered at us. I again turned a critical eye on our appearances. Stubbornly, I had slipped out of my paisley shirt and donned a pinkish floral one, while Dave was wearing a very nice and slightly pointed pair of shoes. </p> <p>There are a number of conclusions you can draw from these two incidents: (a) I was having a gay day; (b) men think floral shirts are gay; (c) men believe two men talking together gay; and (d) homophobia remains the acceptable face of hate among many British men. </p> <p>You can wring your hands about such moments. I haven't heard \"gay\" used as a term of abuse against me since I was a teenager living in Norfolk a decade ago. Now confined to a convivial bubble of chattering-class London, I stupidly assumed our society had outgrown it as a term of abuse. </p> <p>It hasn't - or men haven't - and the reason it pops up in Soho is that the very centre of London on a Saturday night, filled with drunken visitors, is more representative of the rest of the country than any other part of our atypically tolerant capital. </p> <p>As a teenager, I would have been genuinely distressed by it. Not because I was homophobic but because I had attracted attention for being slightly different: too skinny, too wimpy, too middle-class-can't-get-a-girlfriend. This time, I really wasn't bothered. The whole situation was too ridiculous. If they were people whose judgment was worthy of respect, I would have taken it as a compliment. A way of saying \"nice shirt\". </p> <p> So we laughed it off. Of course some might say that as a privileged, educated, white male, who suffers no real discrimination, I have a duty to confront such prejudice. But challenging these attitudes is hopelessly tangled up with the situation: you tell them their homophobia is pathetic and unacceptable, but they just think you're secretly embarrassed to have been labelled gay. The men in question were also drunk, and any reasoned argument would have quickly been brought to a halt by their joyful beating of my effete features into a pulp. </p> <p>If victims can't act and bystanders won't, the government cannot stand by and let this happen. Privileged straight men should be protected by The Awareness of The Metrosexual Act 2004. Teaching the basic tenets of metrosexuality should be made compulsory in schools, while a public awareness campaign is rolled out across the country, with Jude Law telling the nation that floral shirts, pastel shades and frothy cafe lattes are not a sexual signifier but a modern, metropolitan, lifestyle choice. </p> <p>Perhaps the government could even intervene to ensure millions of British men have fully functioning gaydars. Despite Graham Norton, Will &amp; Grace and Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, heterosexual men - and even metrosexual men - remain utterly useless at quietly working out whether another man is gay or not. </p> <p>In this case, my mates and I may have been wearing slightly more adventurous attire than the jeans-and-shirt on your average bloke. We may also have lacked the contented gut and girth of many of our happily married peers but, as any gay man or metropolitan woman would have spotted instantly, we were far too unkempt and just not buff enough to be gay. </p> <p>Why not introduce a seven-day gaydar workshop as part of a mandatory rehabilitation programme for those found guilty of homophobic abuse? Of course critics might argue this would only protect privileged metrosexuals like me and could actually help raging homophobes more accurately pinpoint their bile against real gay men. But as anyone knows, a better awareness of who is gay, and an understanding of what it means to be gay, can only deepen man's humanity to man. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:patrick.barkham@theguardian.com\">patrick.barkham@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, flies to Libya today for talks with President Muammar Gadafy against a background of mounting crisis over the arrival and expulsion of unwanted immigrants. <p>Italy yesterday resumed airlifting hundreds of would-be immigrants who have landed in recent days on the southern Italian island of Lampedusa. Human rights groups have condemned the expulsions as a violation of the migrants' right to apply for refugee status. </p> <p>The UN high commissioner for refugees has also expressed concern and complained that its representatives have not yet received clearance to speak to the would-be immigrants. </p> <p>The airlift was suspended on Tuesday. The government has not provided an explanation, but according to some Italian media reports Libya refused to take back the deportees. </p> <p>Four C-130 military aircraft, each carrying around 90 migrants, were due to take off from Lampedusa yesterday. By last night it was expected that only 250 of the 1,000 or so arrivals would be left in a reception centre on the island that is designed to take less than 200. </p> <p>Apparently oblivious to Italy's hard line, a further 21 would-be immigrants arrived in the night from Tuesday to Wednesday on an inflatable launch. Most recent arrivals have turned up in Italian waters crammed aboard unseaworthy vessels that have been cast loose by traffickers operating from the Libyan coast. </p> <p>Mr Berlusconi's visit to Tripoli will be his second in less than two months. He last met Colonel Gadafy on August 25.</p>",
  "<p>It has been another month of diverse mobile game releases, the industry moving ever further from the days of Space Invaders and Pac-Man clones. Korean publisher Com2Us has released its neat scrolling beat-'em-up Werewolf, set in a weird futuristic city where lycanthropes battle with killer robots and mutants. </p> <p>The set-up is straightforward: you wander through a series of scenes, kicking and punching anything that comes at you while learning more powerful combo moves. The chunky visual style and repetitive, but mindlessly compelling, gameplay will remind late-80s arcade dwellers of classics such as Double Dragon and Streets of Rage. As usual, the keyboard controls make it difficult to access diagonal movement, which can get frustrating in the heat of battle. </p> <p>Much more cerebral is GameLoft's excellent 1,000 Words, a simple brain teaser where you are presented with six letters and must make a set amount of words within a strict time limit. Achieve this, and it is on to the next round, and a new set of letters. The longer your words, the more points you pick up. </p> <p>Power-ups are awarded for constant success, while forfeits are handed out when you fail to find a word in time. There are various gameplay modes and skill levels to keep the challenge fresh, but sadly, there is no two-player mode. If nothing else, it is great Scrabble practice. </p> <p>However, the piece de resistance is the almost self-explanatory Jumbo Rumble from Sumea, a three-player combat game in which you guide your tiny elephant around a small platform, attempting to knock your opponents into the sea. </p> <p>Three players can take part on one handset as you only need one button to control your jumbo - a cursor revolves around your character and when it is in the position between you and your desired destination, you hit the key to move. It is daft and insultingly simple but easily one of the most amusing multiplayer mobile games we have ever played. </p> <p>Offbeat but instantly entertaining titles such as this are quite commonplace in Korea and Japan, where developers have a real understanding of clever, throwaway entertainment. Hopefully, Jumbo Rumble will prove the first of many attempts to import that eccentricity to the west. </p> <p> <strong> Useful links </strong> </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.com2us.com/english/index_e.asp\">www.com2us.com/english/index_e.asp</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.gameloft.com\">www.gameloft.com</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.sumea.com\">www.sumea.com</a></p>",
  "The candidate roars into the rally in a giant articulated truck, all gleaming chrome and tinted windows. The face plastered along the side of the lorry, muscles bulging beneath a taut white T-shirt, is the same as that just visible through the windscreen of the truck. <p>The lorry pulls to a halt, the door swings open and a cowboy boot daintily points down to the running board, followed by the rest of the candidate. The hair! The eyebrows! The tan! The sports jacket! The slacks! It is a thrilling composite, a psephologist's wet dream. </p> <p>He stands, poised in the door of the cab, waving to the cheering crowds, his face fixed in a grin, one hand outstretched with a thumb poking up like a fingerpuppet. He doesn't speak; he merely gazes into the distance, scanning the crowd, as if waiting for the director to shout, \"Cut!\" </p> <p>But there is no director and there is no crowd - unless you count the gaggle of journalists summoned for the occasion, the police, the staff and the half-dozen curiosity seekers, the only real people present at this factory on the outskirts of the outskirts of Los Angeles. Actually, there's no campaign either, though much of Arnold Schwarzenegger's first year in office as governor of California has born a distinct resemblance to one. </p> <p>By now the governor is getting tired of standing on the steps of the giant truck. You can see questions starting to arise in his eyes: should I stop waving now? Do I grin or adopt my serious expression at this point? How will this play on TV? </p> <p>Schwarzenegger eases himself down from the step and with obvious relief starts to talk to the 20 or so people gathered behind a line of police barriers. \"Very nice,\" he says, grinning and nodding and proferring his thumb. </p> <p>He makes a nice little speech about bringing business back to California - he is here to highlight his efforts to reverse the migration of small businesses to states where labour costs are lower - and gets on with the main business of the day, the photo op. </p> <p>Like so much of his political life, the photo op gently plays on Schwarzenegger's previous lives as movie star and bodybuilder. He lumbers with his strange, steroid-laden gait along the side of the truck to help two workers - they look too real to be actors - unbolt its rear doors. The truck, like the workers, is emblazoned with the slogan, \"Arnold says: California wants your business.\" (Actually, he says \"Kah-li-fornia\".) It's knowing and funny, mocking his Austrian origin and his comic mittel-European accent, unexpected in a holder of one of the most powerful political offices in the land. </p> <p>The back doors of the truck swing open to reveal a pile of cardboard boxes bearing the slogan, \"Arnold's Moving Co\". </p> <p>\"This is a really heavy box,\" he says, grunting, as one of the workers passes him a box to place on a trolley. Schwarzenegger likes to play. He mugs for the cameras, staggering under the impossible weight of the boxes, before handing one to the slight owner of the company who, being less of an actor than the politician, places it with no apparent effort on the trolley. Everyone laughs. This is fun. This doesn't matter. This is politics: it's just like showbusiness. </p> <p>This is a typical Schwarzenegger event, a standard ingredient in a day in the life of the man who a year ago today was voted in as governor of the state with the seventh-largest economy in the world. Back then, everybody took it for a bit of a joke. Sure, there had been an actor before as governor of California, one who even went on to become president, but he at least had served his political apprenticeship, having worked his way through the smoke-filled rooms of the Golden State. What would, or could, Schwarzenegger do? </p> <p>A year on, Schwarzenegger has been hailed as the great healer, derided as the great divider, garlanded for bringing a new spirit of bipartisanship to Californian politics, attacked for merely telling people what they want to hear. The contradictions are endless and confusing. To his detractors they show the tactical naivety of a political novice, the crass approach of a Hollywood star accustomed to a chorus of yes-men. To his cheerleaders, they are all part of his master strategy to disorientate the opposition, break the mould of politics as usual (sound familiar?), crack heads together and focus minds. </p> <p>\"Arnold Schwarzenegger is a scoundrel,\" says Californian Democratic party strategist Bob Mulholland. \"He's not a man who keeps his word. He'll look you in the face, make a pledge and then an hour later will say the opposite. His tenure has been all sizzle, no steak. He's acting as if he's still on stage. Truth or lies, it's of no concern: he's lied all his life to promote his career.\" </p> <p>Taken on its own, his record in office is distinctly underwhelming. He was elected on two populist promises: to resolve California's budget crisis and to reform the political culture in the state capital of Sacramento. Today, the budget crisis is as bad as it was a year ago. Schwarzenegger was eventually able to push through a budget, but it was late and merely rolled over the $12bn debt into the coming years. And despite his populist rhetoric, the political culture in Sacramento runs along pretty much as before, with Democrats and Republicans sparring, doing deals and being swayed by lobbyists. But Schwarzenegger's poll ratings remain in rude good health, with 65% saying that they think he's doing a good job. </p> <p>\"He's more of a politician than anybody expected,\" says Marc Cooper of the LA Weekly. \"He's certainly more of a politician than your average politician. To be an effective politician, you probably have to be a good actor.\" </p> <p>\"He wears risers in his boots,\" counters Mulholland. \"He's a 5ft 10in citizen of Austria who believes his real place in history is to be president of the United States. You've got to be distrustful of a politician who has a makeup artist with him 24/7.\" </p> <p>\"His real gift is to let people see him as the Terminator and see the characters he's played,\" says Jamie Court, founder of ArnoldWatch.org, a website devoted to cataloguing the governor's relationship with big business. \"And they don't pay much attention to what he's done. What he's proving is that all politics is showbusiness. He's a brand.\" </p> <p>Even half a minute spent listening to a Governor Schwarzenegger speech bears out much of what Court says. He doesn't let a speech go without saying, \"I'll be back\", or making liberal use of the verb \"to terminate\". His everyday speeches are littered with verbal plays on bodybuilding and the terminology of action heroes. </p> <p>But it goes beyond image. In a move borrowed from the control freakery of Hollywood, the governor's staff have to sign confidentiality agreements, pledging not to disclose anything about Schwarzenegger. And he has also entered into an unholy alliance with the tabloid press. </p> <p>Political writer Ann Louise Bardach documented Arnold's tabloid dealings for Los Angeles magazine, disclosing how he entered into a business agreement with the biggest tabloid group in the market, publisher of the National Enquirer, among others. \"There was a series of meetings,\" she says, \"which put the tabloids out of running stories about Arnold Schwarzenegger's past and they became cheerleaders. They totally flipped the coin. It became Arnold the great family man. He basically delivered a knock-out punch.\" </p> <p>Perhaps Schwarzenegger's most enduring contribution to the evolution of political discourse during his first year in office will be the rebirth of the phrase \"girlie men\". It first appeared in an old TV skit on Saturday Night Live, where two pumped-up bodybuilders with funny accents threatened to kick sand in the face of all and sundry. Everyone laughed, including the butt of the joke, Schwarzenegger. After all, it was just a sketch. </p> <p>And then, demonstrating self-awareness and a facility with his own history, Schwarzenegger used the phrase this July to describe his political opponents in the midst of a fraught attempt to pass the state's budget. Less than two months later, he used the phrase again, this time at what was billed as the crowning moment of his debut year in politics, a prime-time speech at the Republican party national convention in New York. \"The girlie men flap\", as one Republican national official referred to it, gives an insight into Schwarzenegger's approach. The remark was far from spontaneous: it referenced Schwarzenegger's past life, it showed the governor to be both human and tough, and it confirmed the notion that the old political system was somehow to blame. </p> <p>It also represented a turning point, the point at which nice conciliatory, bipartisan Arnie - the one being cute with the kids in Kindergarten Cop - gave way to the bullying, scheming, hard-assed Arnie, not so much the one in the Terminator films as the Arnie glimpsed in his breakthrough movie, Pumping Iron, the documentary where he plays mind games on his opponents and psychs himself to a sixth Mr Universe title. </p> <p>\"A Democratic staffer early on called him a wuss,\" says Dan Walters, veteran political columnist for the Sacramento Bee. \"In the early confrontation,s he blinked. Once that happened, the Democrats started to lose their fear of this dominating figure. It appears that he was taken aback that his gestures to the Democrats were not reciprocated and you've seen him try to get tough. But it's harder to get tough when you've been soft.\" </p> <p>So Schwarzenegger learned the hard way that being nice to people in politics doesn't necessarily win you friends. </p> <p>\"In Hollywood it doesn't matter how good you are, it depends on how popular you are. In politics, popularity is great but it doesn't do any good if you don't use it, it just goes away. To have some impact, he can't say yes to everybody.\" </p> <p>The past few weeks have seen a hardening of the Schwarzenegger stance on many issues. He has been busy wielding his veto on a long list of bills that many liberals hoped he might support, from the granting of driver's licences for undocumented immigrants to allowing prescription drugs to be purchased more cheaply in Canada and increasing the minimum wage. His arguments in favour of veto are almost always economic, taking the view that regulation will hinder job creation: he might be quoting his close economic adviser, Milton Friedman, the man who brought monetarism to Britain in the 1980s. </p> <p>Has Schwarzenegger been a success as a politician? In many ways, it really doesn't matter. Schwarzenegger is an illusionist. Like that other pre-eminent Republican, George Bush, what he believes, goes. What he sees, and chooses to see, is what is real. If Schwarzenegger does not see it, it does not exist. If Schwarzenegger does not promote it, it is dead. All can be swept away by the power of positive thinking. </p> <p>Does his positive thinking take him so far as to dream of occupying the White House? This week, for the first time since the 1870s, a senate committee considered an amendment to article 2 of the US constitution, which requires that a president be a \"natural born\" citizen of the country. The amendment, sponsored by Schwarzenegger's old friend, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, would make citizens of 20 years eligible. Schwarzenegger, who has dual Austrian-US citizenship, took the oath in 1983. Another friend of the governor's has set up a website to lobby for the amendment. </p> <p>In New York during the Republican convention much of the chatter centred on the possibility that the way might be eased for Schwarzenegger to take a shot at the presidency. The succession to Bush was the subtext to the September jamboree, with Vietnam veteran John McCain and former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani the names most talked about. But many senior Republicans reason that the appeal of Schwarzenegger might be too strong to resist. </p> <p>\"He has his eye on the presidency, no question,\" says Bardach. \"The big figures in the party said that he's pushing very hard, and these other guys look at him as a competitor.\" </p> <p>In public, the candidate himself is mute on the subject, talking instead about the task at hand when asked about his ultimate ambition. And the pundits - citing everything from the constitution to Schwarzenegger's sleazy past - and even some of the facts, point against the Austrian-born governor becoming US president. </p> <p>\"This guy is George Bush with a personality and big biceps,\" says ArnoldWatch's Jamie Court. \"If we change the constitution and allow him to become president, you'd better watch it.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Get off the line</strong><br> So Tony Blair expects every home to have access to broadband by 2008. That's as may be, but will every home be using it?

Until BT is forced to separate the need for a phone from broadband use, it seems we are stuck with this extra bill. </p> <p>Every home would probably love to have broadband and use it, but not if a largely obsolete piece of equipment has to be rented along with it. <br> <strong> Ketlan Ossowski</strong> <br> Lancaster </p> <p><strong> Out of bounds</strong><br> Steve Ayers takes Victor Keegan to task for advocating a tax on analogue TV sales (Feedback, September 30) but what of the stealth tax imposed on us for Channels 4 and Five? While BBC is freely available with our satellite dish, we have to pay extra to receive C4 and Five by this means - both are unobtainable in this area via earthbound sources. </p> <p>As I understand the regulations covering the switch to digital, only those channels already available via analogue will, by law, have to provide a digital access. This means we will still be switched off. <br> <strong> David P Bosworth</strong> <br> Abergavenny </p> <p><strong> Hold off</strong><br> With reference to the article by Bobbie Johnson (Digital dilly-dallying, September 30); surely the government should ensure the whole country can receive subscription-free digital television before consideration is given to turning off the analogue signal. </p> <p>I live in a high-density population area but, unfortunately, cannot receive digital television through a Freeview box and have no wish to subscribe to Sky or cable. I would buy a Freeview box today if the digital signal was available. Talking of a switch-off date for analogue television when not all the country can receive \"free\" digital is surely a case of putting the horse before the cart. <br> <strong> Paul Bacon</strong> </p> <p><strong> Analogue ban</strong><br> Although I have a digitally enabled television and a Freeview box, I would be far from unaffected by an early switch-off of analogue services. I have two other TV sets, two video recorders and the ability to view TV on my PC - all of which only contain analogue tuners. In the government statistics, however, I count as a household that has already switched to digital TV. The first step in digital switchover ought to consist in banning the sale of analogue-only equipment. Then, only after the elapse of a reasonable period (say five years minimum), should the analogue signal be switched off.  <strong> David McBrien</strong> <br> Berkshire </p> <p><strong> Digital outsiders</strong><br> My elderly mother is keen to acquire a Freeview box and \"go digital\", but she has been told that the communal aerial in her block of flats will not receive a digital signal, and that there are no plans to upgrade it. The cable network in her area stops around 200 yards away, and satellite dishes are not permitted. She lives in the centre of a medium-size city. </p> <p>I don't imagine this is an isolated situation and, although many households are happily digitalised, others who would be eager to embrace the new technology are being prevented from doing so through circumstances beyond their control. <br> <strong> Pat Poynton</strong> <br> Bristol </p> <p><strong> Multiple cost</strong><br> In the recent discussions about the analogue switch-off, I haven't read anything about video recorders. Are there plans to produce cheap VHS or DVD recorders with digital tuners? </p> <p>At the moment, people will regularly watch one channel while taping another and think nothing of it. When the only source of a signal is a digital box with a single tuner, as most Sky and Freeview boxes are now, this will no longer be possible. The extra channels available will mean there will be an increased chance of a clash of programs. Multiple boxes will be required and maybe even mutiple aerials. Those with Sky+ boxes and the Freeview equivalent will be laughing, but it seems there will be an ever increasing outlay for electronic products so people can continue watching TV as they do now. <br> <strong> Duncan McMinn </strong> </p> <p><strong> Apple's appeal</strong><br> Although the tone of Michael Hale's letter (Feedback, September 30) has changed from his previous posting, he still implies that the components used by Apple are of poor quality. </p> <p>Perhaps there are higher specified graphics cards available, and Apple could certainly install more memory as standard, but it is clear to anyone who has owned a Mac that not only are the design, build, software and components of the highest quality, but they are designed and matched to work beautifully with each other.

  "Moaning about the price of a pint is as much part of the British pub as a dartboard, dodgy carpet and brassy landlady, but according to the new edition of the Good Pub Guide many drinkers really do have something to complain about. <p>Its annual beer survey found that the pattern of pub ownership has pushed up the price of a pint at many locals by nearly 10p. </p> <p>The average at pubs owned by two companies which control nearly a quarter of the total, Enterprise and Punch, is \u00a32.25, \"significantly more expensive\" than the average \u00a32.16 in free houses. </p> <p>The editors, Alisdair Aird and Fiona Stapley, said it was difficult to escape the conclusion that this pattern of ownership was working against the consumers' interests. </p> <p>It was imperative to bring price competition back into play, they said. Tenants should be given the legal right to buy and stock one beer from an independent supplier other than their pub's owners. </p> <p>The survey found the cheapest pints being served in Lancashire, which has regained its best-value crown from Nottingham. Lancashire's \u00a31.90 compares with \u00a32.41 in the most expensive areas, Surrey and London. </p> <p>Provocatively, they added that a ban on smoking in pubs was \"so overwhelmingly in the interests of both customers and staff, that we would like to see a ban in place as soon as possible\". </p> <p>There was \"simply too much resistance within the industry\" for a voluntary approach to succeed. </p> <p>On the brighter side, the number of pubs playing irritating background music had stopped growing and might even have dropped slightly, and \"common sense\" had come back into pub cooking, letting \"good produce\" speak for itself. </p> <p>The guide's pub of the year is the Lough Pool, in Sellack, Herefordshire, and its brewer of the year Timothy Taylor &amp; Co of Keighley, West Yorkshire.</p>",
  "The last time I stood for real was the day I walked the central ridge of the Isla del Sol, the main island of Lake Titicaca in the Bolivian Andes, in the company of an Australian policeman and a Fijian built like a rugby prop forward. On either side we could see the clear waters of the lake in the brilliant Andean sunshine, not too hot at 12,500ft. <p>The two men had come to Bolivia from Australia via Brazil and Argentina, whereas I had come the opposite way via Central America, Ecuador and Peru. We met on the boat to the island. Later that night, in my hotel bedroom, having enjoyed a dinner of fresh trout from the lake, I broke my neck when I passed out and fell on to a tiled floor. As you may know by now, as a result of this ridiculous fall, I am paralysed below the shoulders. </p> <p>Well, once again I can now stand up. Sorry to disappoint anybody anticipating a tale of miracle recovery, though; this feat is accomplished by purely mechanical means (on which, more later), but it is a wonderful experience none the less. </p> <p>I love standing at the window, looking out to the garden. It's a small thing but I get a better view with a wider field of vision. Looking around a room, though, is strange after so much sitting and lying down; everything shrinks in size - the television, sofa, and coffee table - as I tower above them. What gives me most joy is standing next to my wife, Val, looking down; the old, familiar, misogynist order restored! The worst is having to resign myself to the inescapable fact that my son is now taller than me, having grown, subversively, during the years since my accident. I can no longer maintain the fiction that I am the tallest in the family. A rite of passage of sorts, in the wrong direction, I can't help feeling. </p> <p>This all comes about because of the piece of mechanical wizardry bought with the proceeds of about three years of fundraising by friends and relatives: my powered wheelchair, which can metamorphose into a bed, or a standing frame, be conveniently elevated in a sitting position to the height of a bar stool, and be propelled at six kilometres an hour through the local shopping precinct, scattering all before me. </p> <p>At first, I could stand for only a couple of minutes before beginning to feel faint with collapsing blood pressure. Low blood pressure is a constant problem for people with spinal injuries and I suffer more than most. When first injured I could only eat lying down; the rush of blood away from my brain to the stomach to digest food was too much for me. Even now, I struggle after eating. Gradually however, I have extended the standing time to about half an hour and hope, with practice, to be able to stand as often and for as long as I like. </p> <p>The chair has serious purposes - to allow my legs and hips to bear the weight of my body again and to stretch the Achilles tendons so that my feet don't end up pointing like those of a ballet dancer. It also helps prevent or delay the onset of the bone disease osteoporosis - a problem for anyone in a wheelchair - and aids blood circulation. But the fun comes at parties, levitating to bar-stool level to chat eye-to-eye with friends, a glass of wine by my side; and at the local bookshop, browsing the upper shelves. </p> <p> More sophisticated controls will soon be available for the chair: with them I shall not only be able to drive it myself using my head as a joystick in an electromagnetic field generated by the chair's headrest (will it fry my brains?), but also control some things around me: open the door to callers, turn on the television and change channels, switch on the lights and sound the alarm. </p> <p>Now I have to confront the problems of the outside world that start as soon as I go through the back gate - kerbs too steep to mount, broken paving stones and the peculiar adverse camber of the pavement that threatens to tip me out of the chair or propel me into the road, something you never notice when just out walking. </p> <p>The local highways department promises improvement, but not just yet - they are strapped for cash until the next financial year. Until then, the best they can do is mark the problem areas with yellow paint. As soon as I can I shall have to go all the way into town, making a detailed map along the way of all of the kerbs, potholes and dangerous crossings in my way. </p> <p>How great is it to have an excuse to become the neighbourhood cranky man?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edguiton@yahoo.com\">edguiton@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A family feud is expected to resurface at Kent brewer Shepherd Neame after it emerged that the cousin of chairman Bobby Neame has tabled a resolution attacking the control the 70-year-old and his son Jonathan have over the business. </p> <p>Stuart Neame's departure from the boardroom last year ended in an employment tribunal after the then vice-chairman went public with claims that the group's operating profits were questionable. </p> <p>Shepherd Neame yesterday said his resignation had cost the group \u00a3822,000, including a \u00a3460,000 provision to cover his pension and a \u00a3362,000 charge relating to legal costs. </p> <p>Stuart Neame, who is said to speak for about 18% of shares, has denied that he is seeking to run the business himself, but he has nevertheless tabled a resolution highlighting the lack of independence between chairman Bobby and Jonathan, who was appointed chief executive last November. </p> <p>He is also calling for greater financial disclosure of the group's brewing, property and pub management businesses, and for the appointment of his brother Roderick as a director. </p> <p>Stuart Neame has previously called for the appointment of Miles Templeman as chairman. Mr Templeman recently took the helm at struggling family drinks groups HP Bulmer and Eldridge Pope. </p> <p>Yesterday Jonathan Neame said a chairman designate would be announced in three weeks to take over from Bobby Neame next year. He said Stuart Neame's persistent interventions were a \"distraction and a cost to the company\".</p>",
  "<p>The astronaut Gordon Cooper, who has died aged 77, was associated with the early series of US missions which paved the way for a flight to the moon and proved that manned craft could successfully link up in space. </p> <p>He was also the first American to be televised from space - and the first astronaut to manage an undisturbed seven hours' sleep while in orbit. As one of the seven original Mercury astronauts, he was among the group whose heroic exploits won the admiration and backing of the American public for a manned space programme. </p> <p>Cooper was 36 years old, and the youngest astronaut, when he piloted Faith 7, the sixth and last flight of the Mercury series in May 1963. Two years later, he commanded Gemini 5 in a flight that was critical for the goal of exploration; he stayed in orbit long enough to demonstrate that a trip to the moon was feasible. </p> <p>Born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, Cooper claimed that he first took the controls of an aircraft at the age of only seven or eight, when his father, an army colonel, sat him in the cockpit. After service with the US Marine Corps, from 1945 to 1946, he studied for three years at the University of Hawaii and took an army commission. </p> <p>He transferred to the US air force in 1949, trained as a pilot from 1950 to 1954, and was assigned to a fighter pilot squadron in West Germany, where he flew F-84s and F-86s. He received a degree in aeronautical engineering from the institute of technology at Wright- Patterson air base, Ohio, and became a test pilot based at Edwards air base, California. </p> <p>Cooper was selected for the astronaut corps in April 1959; at 32, he was the youngest of the team. His flight in his Faith 7 spacecraft stretched the capabilities of the Mercury capsule to the limits. The mission lasted more than 34 hours and completed 22 orbits, more than three times the length of any preceding manned US space flight. </p> <p>It far exceeded the initial design capability of the capsule. During his flight, Cooper earned the distinction of becoming the first astronaut to sleep in space. However, trouble occurred when a warning light signalled that the craft was no longer weightless, indicating it was making a premature re-entry. Ground controllers diagnosed a major failure of the automatic control system, and Cooper had to perform a manual re-entry, bringing Faith 7 to a perfect splashdown just 7,000 yards from a waiting naval vessel, the USS Kearsarge, in the Pacific Ocean. </p> <p>In another eventful mission, Cooper notched up another first; no previous astronaut had gone into orbit twice before he flew Gemini 5, in August 1965, with another Mercury veteran, Pete Conrad. Their goal was to prove that astronauts could survive in space long enough to perform a lunar mission. </p> <p>The motto for the flight was \"Eight days or bust\", but their journey was plagued by problems with power systems, thruster fuel venting gas that caused the spacecraft to roll, and more upsets in a long series. Though they failed by just over an hour to meet that eight-day target (192 hours), Cooper and Conrad got themselves and their spacecraft back intact. </p> <p>During the flight, they accomplished a shadow rendezvous with an imaginary spacecraft, an exercise designed to demonstrate that such link-ups could be done. They carried out 17 scientific experiments and observations of the earth to test the military's ability to spy from space. </p> <p>Cooper left Nasa, and retired from the US air force as a colonel, in July 1970, after which he founded a consultancy with interests from aerospace to hotel and land development projects. He was also a director of a number of other organisations, most specialising in energy, advanced electronics systems, efficient homes, boats and marine systems and equipment. </p> <p>He continued to design and test new aircraft in southern California, never giving up his passion for pushing at the frontier of technology. </p> <p>He also achieved the rare distinction of becoming the the first active-duty military man to address joint sessions of the US Congress twice. </p> <p>Cooper was married twice. His wife Suzan and four daughters survive him. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Leroy Gordon Cooper, astronaut, born March 6 1927; died October 4 2004</p>",
  "<b>Daily Mail</b> <br>Editorial, October 5 <p>\"For those friends of Israel - and this paper counts itself one of them - the last few days have been extremely distressing. With the world's eyes turned on Iraq and the American elections, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has been engaged in a brutal attack on Gaza ... </p> <p>\"The scale of [Israel's] latest intervention is out of all proportion to the threat. Excessive use of military force will test the loyalty of Israel's many allies. More pertinently, it will convert a new generation of Palestinians to terrorism. Only the US, which has invested so much in the Iraq war, can deliver a solution. If it had devoted a tenth of this energy to building a Middle East peace, this crisis might not have come to such a tragic pass.\" </p> <p><b>Irish Times</b><br>Editorial, October 5 </p> <p>\"Israel's assault on northern Gaza ... is just as large-scale and destructive as previous operations there and on West Bank towns over the last year, but international reaction has been much more muted than before ... </p> <p>\"[That] is partly explained by the fact that the operation was provoked by the despicable killing of two young children in the Israeli town of Sderot in a rocket attack launched from Gaza and claimed by the Hamas resistance movement. But it is also because the more severe violence in Iraq has overshadowed this Israeli operation and because the US presidential election has diverted the attention of the principal internationa players with an interest in the conflict. As a result, Mr Sharon feels little constraint on his plan to deal a lethal military blow against Hamas prior to the proposed Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\" </p> <p><b>Linda S Heard</b><br>Gulf News, United Arab Emirates, October 5 </p> <p>\"President George Bush's war on terror has been a veritable godsend for Israel's rightwing parties, providing an ostensible pretext for state-sponsored atrocities ... The Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat, [has] called for third-party intervention to stop the killing. As long as Israel labels the conflict as an internal matter it isn't going to happen. </p> <p>\"Iran's foreign ministry has accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. France's foreign minister has appealed to both Israel and the Palestinian Authority for an end to the violence. Egypt's foreign affairs minister has called for restraint and Tunisia has expressed its concern ... [But] as long as the UN, the EU, Russia and the Arab League spout punch-less platitudes and allow Israel and the US to remain a law unto themselves - to the shame of all of us - the cries, the blood and the tears of the people of Gaza will remain virtually ignored.\" </p> <p><b>Wall Street Journal Europe</b><br>Editorial, October 5 </p> <p>\"One of the things that sets this incursion apart from similar Israeli military campaigns in the past is Europe's rather muted reaction. While normally jumping on every opportunity to criticise the Jewish state for trying to protect its citizens, most European capitals have so far remained unusually silent ... </p> <p>\"Could it be that Europe is finally waking up to the reality in the Middle East? ... Without openly acknowledging it, most European leaders have followed Israel's and America's calls to isolate Mr Arafat ... </p> <p>\"Only a military solution can end the Palestinian terror. And thanks to improved intelligence, targeted assassinations and the security barrier, the Israelis are saying that it can be done. Palestinian suicide bombers now find it almost impossible to reach their targets. That's why Hamas has resorted to firing rockets ... Israel, like any sovereign nation, cannot allow its population to come under missile attacks from enemy territory.\" </p> <p><b>Evelyn Gordon</b><br>Jerusalem Post, October 4 </p> <p>\"When enemy soldiers are actively hunting armed men through the streets, using tanks, machine guns, and helicopter missiles, what kind of parent endangers his children's lives by taking them outside to mingle with the targets and watch the show? No matter how hot and humid it is, one would expect a parent to keep his children in the house under those circumstances. But not, apparently, a Palestinian parent ... </p> <p>\"So many Palestinian civilians deliberately chose to put themselves and their children into the line of fire. In our modern civilised world, it is apparently perfectly reasonable to sacrifice your children for the sake of generating anti-Israel propaganda.\" </p> <p><b>Danny Rubinstein</b><br>Haaretz, Israel, October 4 </p> <p>\"Palestinian commentators say the excessive force used by Israel in Gaza is first and foremost an indication of the weakness of Mr Sharon's government ... Such a thought encourages the attackers to continue until the Israeli withdrawal, and after it as well. </p> <p>\"All these things are true not only for Gaza, but also for the West Bank. Without an agreement and settlement in Gaza, it is almost certain that the rockets and mortar fire will reach the West Bank. They will be the Palestinian answer to the separation barrier, and they will overcome it even after the Israeli Defence Force makes the wall in Jerusalem three metres higher ... The talks with the Palestinians may be frustrating and annoying - but the truth is that there is no alternative.\"</p>",
  "The Afghan government, supported by the US and UK, is to mount an all-out push over the next six months against officials and warlords involved in the drugs trade, according to Afghan and western officials involved in counter-narcotics. <p>It will pit the Afghan government, supported by the US and other Nato forces, against the private armies of warlords who still control much of the country. </p> <p>Mirwais Yassini, head of counter-narcotics for the transitional Afghan government, said: \"The 10-year strategy [75% reduction in five years and complete eradication in 10] is too long. You go after the high-value targets and we will do that within the next six months.\" The targets would include corrupt ministers and governors in the existing government. Mr Yassini said there could be no political reform or security in Afghanistan without tackling them. </p> <p>The push comes after US impatience with Britain, which is the lead government on drugs control in the Nato-led force occupying Afghanistan, for failing to reduce drug production over the last three years. </p> <p>A UN report out at the end of the month or early November will show an increase in land under poppy cultivation rising from 80,000 hectares (199,900 acres) last year to more than 100,000 this year. Three-quar ters of the world's heroin comes from Afghanistan and is worth billions. Production last year was 3,600 tonnes, with Afghan farmers receiving $100 (\u00a356) a kilo. </p> <p>According to the officials, the drive will see the new president, to be elected on Saturday but widely expected to be a confirmation of the transitional president, Hamid Karzai, begin by cleaning out of his cabinet those ministers involved in the drug trade and the warlords and governors either running the drugs trade in their provinces or collecting \"taxes\" from traffickers. </p> <p>Many of them have private armies, but the Afghan army and anti-narcotics units will be supported on the ground and in the air by US and Nato forces. </p> <p>Another element in the battle is Force 333, a mainly British trained military elite group, intended to fly teams anywhere in Afghanistan to destroy laboratories and heroin stockpiles. </p> <p>Britain sees the criticism of its counter-narcotics strategy as unfair. It says the approach will be effective in the long term. It favours eradication on the ground, with offers to farmers of alternative livelihoods, to the US strategy in Colombia of spraying crops. </p> <p>The determination to reduce production over the next six months is also aimed at reducing the influence of the warlords before parliamentary elections scheduled for April.</p>",
  "A French couple who allowed a friend to drive home drunk after a dinner party went on trial yesterday charged with being partially responsible for the car crash in which he killed himself and four others. <p>The two are being prosecuted for failing to prevent a crime. If they are found guilty, the case will set a legal precedent in France, where legislation has been applied only in cases where those charged knew that a crime was about to be committed. </p> <p>The newly married couple, Angelique and Jean-Sebastian Fraisse, spent an evening with friends on February 23 2000 in their flat in a small town in eastern France. All of them had a lot to drink but, at the end of the evening, one of the guests, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Colin, 29, insisted on driving himself home. </p> <p>Aware of how drunk he was, they claim they tried to stop him, suggesting that he spend the night, hiding his car keys and trying to block his way out of their flat, until he became angry and they gave up. He left their home at 3.45am and half an hour later was driving on the wrong side of a main road when he crashed into another car carrying a family of five. </p> <p>The case has been brought by the maternal grandmother of the only person to survive the crash, a girl now aged nine. Traumatised by the death of her daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren, she claims the couple should have done more to stop Colin from driving, and should at least have called the police when they saw him get into his car. </p> <p>An earlier attempt to prosecute the couple failed, with a judge ruling that it was unreasonable to expect anyone to denounce a friend to the police. </p> <p>\"My clients sincerely believe that they should not be caught up in this case. They did every thing they could to dissuade their friend from leaving their home in that state. This is an impossible suit,\" the couple's lawyer, Bruno Zillig, said. </p> <p>\"They are being accused of not having called the police, and for not having informed on their friend. But this concept of denunciation does not exist in French law.\" </p> <p>Angelique Fraisse, 29, was run over by a drunk driver when she was 16 and is now paraplegic. \"I've got the impression this is part of the charge against her, that they're trying to make Angelique feel that this should have made her feel all the more responsible,\" a friend told Le Parisien yesterday. </p> <p>The couple face a five-year prison sentence and a \u20ac75,000 (\u00a352,000) fine if the prosecution is successful.

  "<p>Energy watchdog Ofgem - after an investigation lasting almost a year - yesterday blamed rising imports and falling domestic production for the soaring price of gas as energy markets again reached fresh highs. </p> <p>The Financial Services Authority, which has been running a parallel inquiry into the gas sector, has ruled out market manipulation. </p> <p>But Ofgem is still investigating why some gas supplies in Britain failed to reach the market and has called on the European commission to investigate what chief executive Alistair Buchanan described as \"some strange behaviour in near-continental Europe\" which affected the UK. </p> <p>Rising wholesale energy prices have meant higher bills for UK business and retail consumers. Domestic gas bills have risen by as much as 19% since October last year while big industrial users are paying more than 40% extra for gas and 25% for electricity. </p> <p>Yesterday, there was little sign of respite as wholesale gas prices, driven by market speculation in the UK, rose 15% to a new record. </p> <p>Oil prices also rose again with the price of US light crude setting a fresh record of $50.66 a barrel, up 75 cents on the day, and London Brent rising 74 cents to $46.93. </p> <p>Traders fretted that with oil production in the United States disrupted after Hurricane Ivan, there could be supply shortages in winter . </p> <p>According to Ofgem's analysis, UK gas supplies have fallen mainly because of a combination of planned and unplanned maintenance and lower yields as fields pass their production peaks. That meant Britain was more reliant on imports from mainland Europe - where, in contrast to the more competitive UK market, the gas price is linked to the price of oil. </p> <p>\"Record oil prices are costing British customers around \u00a31.4bn this winter. Experience from the UK gas market shows there is little doubt that stronger competition in Europe would have diluted any oil price effect and its significant impact on customers' bills,\" Mr Buchanan said. </p> <p>But he warned that the regulator was continuing to investigate why, \"at times of high prices, around 5% of UK gas supplies were physically available but did not reach the market under existing contractual obligations\". </p> <p>Ofgem also expressed concern about the way the system of importing gas from mainland Europe was working. The regulator said it was examining whether companies had acted reasonably by continuing to store gas rather than selling it to the British market at rising prices, and was seeking the backing of the European commission. </p> <p>Ofgem said it would \"work with the competition directorate and ... national regulators to identify and, as neces sary, pursue any potential breaches of competition law\". </p> <p>Any company found breaking either British or European competition rules could face heavy fines. </p> <p>Yesterday both retail and industrial consumers were dis missive of the lengthy Ofgem investigation which was prompted by complaints about rising prices. </p> <p>Jeremy Nicholson of the Energy Intensive Users Group said: \"It doesn't begin to explain the level of gas prices in the UK ... and fails to address why we are paying more for gas here than on the continent.\" </p> <p>Allan Asher of energywatch also criticised the time it had taken Ofgem to produce its report - which, he said, \"suggests to us that [British] consumers have suffered unprecedented price rises, in large part because of an ineffective regulatory structure and a lack of transparency.\"</p>",
  "<p>George Soros, the billionaire investor, is giving greater control of his business to his two sons, Robert and Jonathan, and at the same time scaling back his empire by spinning off several divisions. </p> <p>For years Mr Soros, 74, has devoted an increasing amount of time to philanthropy and is engaged in a concerted effort to unseat George Bush. </p> <p>The changes were disclosed in a memo to investors. The document, written by Soros Fund Management chief executive Mark Schwartz, said the firm had decided to spin-off its credit and real estate divisions into separate companies. In addition, negotiations are under way with the Soros private equity team to separate that business. </p> <p>\"During the past year we have worked to simplify the structure of Soros Fund Management in order to return the firm to its core activity as a hedge fund manager,\" he wrote. </p> <p>Robert Soros, 41, became chief investment officer of Soros Fund Management two weeks ago, the memo said. Jonathan Soros, 34, will become co-deputy chairman of the business alongside his brother. Their father remains chairman. </p> <p>Robert Soros is the eldest of the billionaire's five sons and has worked at Soros Fund Management for most of his career. </p> <p>The credit team will be run by a new management company called Dune Capital and the real estate business has been renamed Grove Capital. </p> <p>Mr Soros managed $20bn (\u00a311.2bn) during the 1990s, making him one of the most powerful financiers in the world. In 1992, he made $1bn from betting against the pound, forcing it from the exchange rate mechanism. </p> <p>Last week, he embarked on a nationwide speaking tour and advertising blitz in his campaign to oust Mr Bush from the White House. Delivering a defeat to the Republican president, he said, would be \"the greatest good deed I could do for the world\". </p> <p>Mr Soros has given $18m to pro-Democratic groups including <a href=\"http://www.Moveon.org\">Moveon.org</a> but he is now moving into the spotlight. In a double-page spread in American newspapers he called the Iraq war \"misconceived from the start\". </p> <p>He said in an interview last week that his son Jonathan was the most likely to continue his political activism. \"I think my son Jonathan is likely to take my political legacy much further.\" </p> <p>The decision to pare back the business appeared to run contrary to Mr Soros's ambitions when he hired Mr Schwartz from Goldman Sachs two years ago.</p>",
  "The government is ready to listen to a message from the kidnappers of Kenneth Bigley but will not enter into negotiations with them, the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said today. <p>Meanwhile, the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, made a new appeal to the kidnappers to release him, Reuters reported Libya's official Jana news agency as saying.</p> <p>Jana said Col Gadafy, who made a similar appeal last month, had requested \"the release of this poor Briton since his family had requested our help\". It added that if the kidnappers had any conditions, they should \"convey them to us in any way possible\". </p> <p>Col Gadafy's London-based son Saif said yesterday that he was using his charity foundation contacts in Iraq to help free Mr Bigley, saying the next 48 hours would be crucial to his fate. </p> <p>Mr Straw, who is on a surprise visit to Iraq, spoke to reporters in Baghdad following his meeting with Iraq's deputy prime minister for national security, Barham Saleh. </p> <p>The foreign secretary also spoke about the preparations taking place for elections in Iraq in January next year. He said violence must not upset the plans and that he had been \"impressed and encouraged\" by the progress made, including the creation of an electoral roll based on old food rationing records. </p> <p>Speaking about Mr Bigley, who was abducted on September 16, Mr Straw said: \"We cannot enter into negotiations but if hostage takers have a message, we will listen to it carefully.\"</p> <p>Mr Bigley, a 62-year-old engineer, was taken along with two Americans from their residence in Baghdad by the Tawhid and Jihad group, led by Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. </p> <p>The two Americans, Eugene Armstrong and Jack Hensley, were decapitated and videos of their executions have appeared on the internet, as have videotapes of Mr Bigley pleading with Tony Blair to save his life. </p> <p>Last night the Irish government said it had issued an Irish passport for Mr Bigley, who is from Liverpool but has an Irish mother. </p> <p>Mr Straw, who arrived in Baghdad after talks with Kurdish leaders in the north, said he discussed the Bigley situation with Mr Saleh and other Iraqi authorities but refused to give details. </p> <p>During his press conference, Mr Straw reaffirmed Britain's determination to defeat terrorism in Iraq. \"The fight against terrorism is a fight for all of us,\" he said. \"That is why it is crucial that the Iraqi people, with our support, are able to defeat this terrorism here in Iraq.\" </p> <p>Despite the disorder, he said there had been good \"technical progress\" in preparing for the January elections. \"We were always determined to do everything we could to ensure that the [UN] security council's deadline of January 31 is met and I have been impressed and encouraged by what I have heard today,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Saleh, a top Iraqi Kurdish official, noted US and Iraqi success last week in regaining control of the so-called Sunni Triangle city of Samarra from rebels and said the government was in contact with representatives from the insurgent stronghold of Falluja to resolve the standoff there.</p>",
  "Generally speaking, only Australians are interested in Australian elections - and not of all them, at that. More so when, as is the case now, the incumbent prime minister, John Howard, looks likely to edge a fourth consecutive term. <p>For the Northern Rivers Echo in Lismore, New South Wales, the big news this week was the location of a new sewage plant. This pungent controversy has left the efforts of the Labor leader, Mark Latham, to defeat the Liberal-National coalition government, led by Mr Howard, in the shade. </p> <p>Another top story concerned a forthcoming celebration of International Lesbian Day at the Italo Club. \"Local identity Nora Vidler-Blanksby will MC,\" the Echo reported. \"The night includes a smorgasbord meal and DJ.\" </p> <p>The Alice Springs News was more exercised about the problem of petrol sniffing than who would be top dog in Canberra after Saturday's election. A Yuendumu community project at the Mt Theo outstation \"has provided a healing environment for sniffers\", a correspondent wrote. </p> <p>This is not to say that election news is entirely absent from the local press. In an apparently blatant bid for votes, the government has reportedly promised Alice Springs its own international airport. According to the Geelong Advertiser, Labor has pledged more funding for regional day-care centres. </p> <p>The Hobart Mercury was fixated meanwhile on Mr Latham's vow to end logging in Tasmania's conservation forests, seen as a transparent pitch for the Green vote. </p> <p>With Australia's economy booming, and unemployment and interest rates low, the two main political parties are not that far apart on domestic issues - although that has not prevented the customary argy-bargy. </p> <p>The hard-hitting Mr Howard's message is fairly basic: \"Who do you trust to keep the economy strong and to protect family living standards?\" His leadership alone would keep Australia secure, he says. Mr Latham, who, aged 43, is 22 years younger than the prime minister, believes it is time for a change. His vow to \"ease the squeeze on middle Australia\" and promote social values has led Mr Howard to dub him a \"behavioural policeman\". </p> <p>It is on international issues that the voters' options become more clear-cut, but even then, there is considerable policy overlap. </p> <p>Tapping into the deep unpopularity of the Iraq war, Mr Latham promised earlier this year to withdraw Australia's troops from the country by Christmas. But this Spanish-style pledge has now been watered down, with some forces likely to remain indefinitely. </p> <p>Echoing the British debate, Mr Latham accuses the prime minister, who in 1999 appointed himself America's regional \"deputy sheriff\", of being too eager to please the US president, George Bush, of undermining national security and misleading the country over Iraq. </p> <p>In a winning performance in a televised debate with Mr Howard, Mr Latham alluded to the terrorism in Bali, in 2002, which ended with 88 Australians killed, and to last month's bombing of Australia's embassy in Jakarta. Mr Howard's unquestioning support for the \"war on terror\" had rendered the country \"less safe\", he claimed. </p> <p>Labor says it wants a more regional approach to foreign and anti-terrorism policies and more emphasis on the UN and upholding international law. Funding would be provided, for example, to train Indonesia's police in counter-terrorism. </p> <p>But for all that, Mr Latham proposes no fundamental change in Australia's key US alliance or the Anzus mutual defence pact. And it was Mr Howard, after all, who long ago recognised the strategic and economic importance of building good relations with China, Asia's biggest player and biggest potential threat. Last year he gave the Chinese leader, Hu Jintao, the honour of addressing parliament. </p> <p>This lack of clear alternatives may help Mr Howard keep his job. It also helps explain the local papers' preferred focus on stories like that of Brent Hall from Meerschaum Vale - who invented a macadamia nut harvester.

  "<p>Christmas and new year are an awkward time to travel. In the run up to the festive season, flights are normally chock full and fares are at their highest. Hotel prices also shoot up for departures which include either of the main festivals.</p> <p>But time your trip carefully, and go for the right sort of break, and you can still get away for at least part of the holiday season without paying through the nose.</p> <p><strong>Packages</strong><br> Christmas holidays in the warmer parts of the Mediterranean don't attract quite as much of a premium as you might fear. Tour operators do push up their prices, but because the climate can't match the heat and sunshine of, say the Caribbean, you'll only pay perhaps \u00a3150-\u00a3200 per person extra. Take the Sovereign Winter Sunshine brochure for example. A stay over Christmas will cost between \u00a3800 and \u00a3900 for a seven-night holiday in a decent hotel in the Canaries, Madeira or Cyprus, compared with about \u00a3700 for the same holiday flying home before Christmas Day.</p> <p> The premiums for travelling long haul are much higher because the pressure on flights is much greater, and demand for hotel rooms in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean is so high. If you want good-value winter sunshine in destinations like these, travel in early December or early January and you can save \u00a3500 a head or more on Christmas prices.</p> <p><strong>France</strong><br> Some of the best value over the festive season is in France. Not all operators offer their accommodation throughout the year, but those that do - <a href=\"http://www.indiv-travellers.com\">Vacances en Campagne</a> for example - tend to charge a mid-season price, as opposed to a top-rate for cottages and villas. That's about 30 or 40% less than you would pay in the summer peak. Of course you'll find the swimming pool empty and you would be wise to check that there is proper central heating, and ideally an open fire.</p> <p> If you book the accommodation independently, you can also get some excellent deals on the ferries or through the tunnel. <a href=\"http://www.eurotunnel.com\">Eurotunnel</a> for example has standard returns at \u00a398 for a car plus passengers this Christmas, and <a href=\"http://www.poferries.com\">P&amp;O's</a> start at \u00a396. That's about a third of the price of the summer peak. Sadly, you can't take advantage of the really cheap day returns aimed at cross-Channel shoppers - the ferry companies monitor cars to make sure they come back within the terms of the ticket.</p> <p><strong>Airfares</strong><br> The formula for getting a good value airfare at this time of year is simple. Book early and avoid the two or three days immediately before Christmas and new year. When we checked in late September, <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">Ryanair</a> one-way fares to Murcia for example were at \u00a370 on December 20, but increased steadily to \u00a3120 by Christmas Eve (taxes and charges - about \u00a322 for a return trip - are extra). There was no flight on Christmas Day, but on Boxing Day the rate was back down to \u00a390. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\">EasyJet's</a> fares to nearby Almeria followed a similar pattern - \u00a362 single on December 20, but \u00a3112 by Christmas Eve. But plan your dates flexibly and you could get a really good return fare flying out on December 17 and back on Boxing Day for \u00a381 return including taxes. If you came back on Christmas Eve, it would be just \u00a361. (Of course all these fares are subject to change and are likely to increase the nearer you get to the departure date). </p> <p><strong>Skiing</strong><br> This year is an awkward one because Christmas Day and New Year's Day fall on Saturdays, which is the normal changeover day for tour operators. Because clients are unlikely to want to travel on those days, operators have been forced to adjust their dates. For example, to some destinations, First Choice Ski is offering nine-night breaks over new year. They are still relatively expensive compared to other times of the year, but are roughly the same cost as seven nights at the same time last year, so they do look good value. </p> <p>Talking to ski operators, I have heard that new year is not selling particularly well at the moment, so there may be some cheaper deals on offer if you still have nothing booked by the end of November. The other way to get a cheap deal is to book accommodation through a resort's home website (most in France have a central booking system for apartments), book a ferry (see above) and drive.</p> <p><strong>The UK</strong><br> Prices for hotels and self-catering houses in the UK sky rocket over both Christmas and new year. <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrustcottages.co.uk\">The National Trust</a> for example, charges its second highest rates of the year - second only to the summer school holidays. It's a similar story with more mainstream agents such as <a href=\"http://www.country-holidays.co.uk\">Country Holidays</a>. There are likely to be some late deals on unsold accommodation from early December, so it may be worth waiting to see what comes up. But even if you have to pay the full rate, at least you will save on travel costs, and may feel after all, that the best way to spend Christmas is in front of a log fire.</p>",

The Up All Night show took us to the town of Ville Platte this weekend, where squirrel season has started. Schools and businesses close, football games are rescheduled.

  "<p>Unions have cautiously welcomed a pledge by the Conservatives to introduce a bill to give teachers legal protection against false allegations from pupils - but have questioned how it would work in practice.</p> <p>The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, told the Conservative party conference in Brighton yesterday that legislation to protect teachers from unjustified allegations would be one of the top priorities of a Tory government.</p> <p>And he promised legal protections for schools against being sued for accidents on school trips.</p> <p>\"Discipline is under attack. There's an assault on a teacher every seven minutes,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But there is hope. There is a better way. On our first day Conservatives will set out plans to give teachers legal protection against pernicious allegations, firm backing on discipline and schools the right to take the final decision on expulsions. </p> <p>\"We will move ahead as fast as possible with a wide-ranging teacher protection bill. My priority is the rights of the 29 pupils out of 30 who want to learn, not the one out of 30 who want to disrupt.\"</p> <p>But a spokeswoman for the National Union of Teachers said it would be difficult in practice to increase legal protection for teachers against false allegations.</p> <p>\"Even if the teacher is given anonymity in the wider world, the school is a small community,\" she said. \"The rumour mill will work and prevent that anonymity in schools. It is difficult to see what legal protection the Tories could give.\"</p> <p>She did, however, welcome the party's pledge to give headteachers the final say on exclusions.</p> <p>\"It is not acceptable for a pupil expelled from school for persistent violence to be put back into the same school by an appeals body,\" she said. \"We are not against an appeals procedure, but we believe the weight should be shifted from the rights of the child who has been expelled to the rights of the other children in the school.\"</p> <p>Anne Longfield, chief executive of the young person's charity 4Children, urged caution over headteachers having the final say. \"There is an onus on schools to go as far as they can to enable children to stay in schools.</p> <p>\"There has to be an appeals procedure because there is always the danger that some schools could wish to exclude children simply because they were bringing standards down or bringing the school into disrepute.\"</p> <p>Mr Collins also told the conference that within his first year as education secretary he would give schools new legal protections and teachers immunity against being sued. But Ms Forsythe said: \"It is difficult to see why schools should have legal immunity if they are reckless. It goes against all natural justice.\"</p> <p>The acting general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, Chris Keates, said: \"The concept of a wide-ranging teacher protection bill offering support on pupil indiscipline, immunity from being sued and legal protection against false and malicious allegations is an interesting idea and merits consideration.\"</p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday October 11 2004</b> <br> We refer to Lord David Cecil as a historian in the obituary of Jonathan Gili below. He was professor of English literature at Oxford from 1948 until 1970.      Jonathan Gili, who has died of leukaemia aged 61, was not only an award-winning filmmaker, but a designer, publisher, photographer and collector of eclectic tastes and insatiable curiosity. His documentary films, most of them for the BBC in the 1980s and 90s, were evidence of his subtle wit, deep knowledge of history and, above all, sympathy for the human spirit and its quirks. <p>Jonathan was born in Oxford, where his parents, the publisher and translator Joan Gili and his wife Elizabeth (McPherson), had moved to escape the Blitz. Before the second world war, with his business partner Henry Warren, Joan had established the most celebrated Spanish-language bookshop in Britain, Dolphin Books, in London's Cecil Court. </p> <p>Before he was 10, Jonathan began to design and construct toy theatre sets. He would demonstrate the plots of operas with the aid of his parents' record player. One childhood friend, Laura Cecil, recalls being given a present of a scene from The Love Of Three Oranges, \"which, of course, I had never heard of. He made the figures from scraps of material from his mother's evening dresses.\" </p> <p>Jonathan was educated at the Dragon school, Oxford, and at Bryanston school, Dorset, where his passion for film really began. He won an exhibition to read greats at New College, Oxford, but later confessed that he had done very little work, instead going to the cinema, often several times a day. At one of the regular Sunday morning drinks parties given by the historian Lord David Cecil and his wife Rachel, he was introduced to Phillida Stone, daughter of the wood engraver and carver Reynolds Stone. Years later, Jonathan said that he had taken one look at her and thought, \"That's the woman I would like to marry.\" </p> <p>As one of the editors and film critic of the student magazine Isis, Jonathan devoted a whole issue to Joseph Losey's The Servant. When Losey came to Oxford to film Accident, Jonathan, Phillida, Laura Cecil and the young John Birt were all roped in as extras. Later, while Phillida studied at St Martin's School of Art and Jonathan searched for work as an assistant film editor, they lived opposite each other in flats in Frith Street, Soho. </p> <p>With a legacy of \u00a350 from Henry Warren, in 1967 Jona- than launched his own publishing enterprise, Warren Editions; its first publication, The Other Side Of The Alde by Kenneth Clark, with engravings by Reynolds Stone, was printed on Stone's own press. While they were working on the proofs, Jonathan asked Reynolds whether he would mind if he married his daughter. \"Just one question,\" Reynolds replied, \"Is there any insanity in your family?\" </p> <p>Warren Editions, all designed by Jonathan, continued for many years, publishing original work by John Betjeman, Jane Grigson, Iris Murdoch, Robin Jacques, Harold Jones, Ian Beck, Glynn Boyd Harte and Phillida Gili, who became a successful children's book illustrator. </p> <p>In 1969, Jonathan edited Ben Platts-Mills's film Bronco Bullfrog. His own directorial debut came in 1971 with Incident, an experimental film for the British Film Institute, starring the young Stephen Frears; that same year, he was assistant editor on Frears's Gumshoe (1971). </p> <p>Although both Bronco Bullfrog and Gumshoe became cult movies of the early 1970s, it proved a lean time until Jonathan won an award for his editing of Stuart Cooper's D-Day drama-documentary Overlord (1975). This led to his first directorial commissions, from London Weekend Television and other studios. </p> <p>Even on his first engagement as assistant editor for the BBC, Edward Mirzoeff, with whom Jonathan later worked regularly, recalled, \"He would arrive lugging carrier-bags full of second-hand books, strange objects and all sorts of printed ephemera. I had never met anyone like him.\" </p> <p>Jonathan's collections filled every room, the staircase and any other space in the Gilis' Fulham house. Decorative pencil sharpeners, snow-scene paperweights, odd-looking pens, cards, labels, sardine tins (later the subject of a book), jostled for position with signed first editions, pop-up books, artists' proofs and thousands of 45rpm singles. </p> <p>When picture discs and, later, hologram CDs became a fad, he acquired every one he could. In an article about his collection in 1986, he wrote, \"Who could resist records shaped like Elton John's hat or Barry Manilow's nose? They have poor sound and often can't be made to play at all ... but as art objects they are sublime.\" </p> <p>This obsessional questing was reflected in the way Jonathan wrote, directed, edited and chose the music for his films. Mirzoeff says that everyone who worked with Jonathan wanted to repeat the experience, and long after producers and sound engineers had been promoted, they would volunteer to go back to their assistant status to work with him again. His first, full-length film for the BBC, in 1979, about Westminster school (a project at first opposed by the school's hierarchy), attracted 12.5m viewers. </p> <p>Shortly afterwards, Will Wyatt, then head of documentary features for BBC television, tried to enlist Jonathan as a permanent member of the film unit. \"What he was so good at was finding subjects that were bizarre yet attractive,\" says Wyatt. \"Things might be strange and curious, but he would then uncover the emotional situations behind them.\" </p> <p>Early features for the BBC included a portrait of Angus Wilson and his partner Tony Garrett for The Other Half series, and there followed such diverse subjects as the No 31 bus (To The World's End, 1985), Mixed Blessings (about two babies accidentally swapped at birth), Coming Home (about servicemen and evacuees returning at the end of the war) and Chocolate! (1990), a study in obsession and addiction. </p> <p>Later, for the series Timewatch, Jonathan made a number of films about aspects of the American west: Typhoid Mary, Pocahontas: Her True Story, Gold Rush Memories, and Tales From The Oklahoma Land Runs, which won an award that particularly delighted Jonathan - from the Cowboy Hall of Fame. </p> <p>Lucinda Lambton, with whom Jonathan made three of his most delightful films (Animal Crackers, A Cabinet Of Curiosities and The Great North Road, between 1985 and 1988), recalls, \"The whole process, from the first meeting to the last day of shooting, would be filled with laughter, not ordinary laughter, but tears running down the cheeks. He gave one the sense of total freedom so that one felt boosted, and the finished film was always more than you'd hoped for.\" </p> <p>In 1984, Jonathan was diagnosed with leukaemia, and the doctors predicted that he would live at most three years. At Hammersmith hospital, west London, he was treated with a new, auto-transfusion technique (in which his bone marrow was replaced by his own frozen blood). Although dangerous, the process was repeated twice, and proved effective. For the rest of his life, he was able to continue working, and his resilience, courage and optimism proved inspirational. </p> <p>With Phillida and their children, Oliver (now a painter), Daisy (who runs a film school) and Orlando (studying politics and history at university), Jonathan was a wonderful host, often cooking the most elaborate meals, with recipes from his grandmother's Spanish cookbook. One of his last films was the two-part feature on the life of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, which was shown over two days just after her death in 2002. Strangely, at first Jonathan resisted the idea of this commission, but it was a gently irreverent, charming and wistful tribute. </p> <p>The filmmakers Jonathan most admired were Jean Renoir, Max Ophuls and Jacques Demy. Their special qualities might be summed up as compassion and wonder at the world and its love stories (Renoir), a delight in the tricks and deceptions of time as interpreted by the camera (Ophuls), and an ability to see the world for ever through a child's eyes (Demy). These were all things that Jonathan understood and aimed for. </p> <p>His final films, earlier this year, were for the BBC 4 series Historians Of Genius. Last year, he was made an OBE. He is survived by his mother, his wife and their children. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Jonathan Francesc Gili, film-maker, born April 19 1943; died October 1 2004</p>",

  "Welcome to the Backbencher, Guardian Unlimited's weekly insider's guide to Westminster. <p> <b> &gt;&gt;&gt; FROM BOURNEMOUTH</b></p> <p>The Backbencher caught up with the Guardian's political correspondent Nicholas Watt and asked him about the mood among the Tory faithful.</p> <p>\"The sun has come out and it's pretty warm in Bournemouth today, and that matches the mood of a lot of the Conservatives here. They know that they're in a pretty desperate position in the polls, but they were all encouraged by Michael Howard's speech. It was brought forward - normally the Tory leader speaks on Thursday, but he spoke on Tuesday, to try and define the week. There was a definite feeling that he had a difficult job. He couldn't do a tub-thumping speech, appealing to the party in an emotional way, because the feeling is that that's what Tony Blair has done for the last few years and people are turned off by it. So it had to be low-key, but being low-key means that people might say 'so what? What are you saying?' The feeling is that Mr Howard got the balance right, and MPs on all sides of the party - including many who have spent the last 10 years criticising and backbiting about Tory leaders - were quite encouraged.</p> <p>\"So there's a good mood here, but it's a realistic mood. They are not saying, privately anyway, that they are about to storm down Downing Street. It's 31 weeks today until the expected general election on May 5, and on that day they should all be taking their cabinet posts with their 'timetable for action'. But I was speaking to one senior shadow minister today and he laughed at the prospect that he would be joining the cabinet. 'There will be no Conservative cabinet in seven months' time,' he said.</p> <p>\"Today is much more of a policy-intensive day. If yesterday was about broad themes, today was policy-heavy. We had David Willetts talking about pensions this morning, and the key speech of the day was by David Davis. And it was really a very tough speech, especially compared with those of recent years when the emollient Oliver Letwin had the job of shadow home secretary - a much more liberal one than David Blunkett, too. </p> <p>\"None of that today from Mr Davis. He was very tough on immigration, and came out with a sentence that might well be picked up: he talked about how a Conservative government would substantially cut immigration into Britain, and then he said 'uncontrolled immigration endangers the values which we in Britain rightly treasure'. Critics may well say that he is straying into the highly sensitive territory that Margaret Thatcher famously trod in the 1979 general election when she talked of Britain being 'swamped' by immigrants. But the Tories believe immigration is an absolutely key area, and they think that if they could define themselves on that in a general election, they could scoop up the Tory voters who have been abandoning the party in recent years.</p> <p>\"They also believe that law and order is going to be another defining issue in the general election, and Mr Davis gave a tough message on crime. He said 'criminals should be afraid', and accused Labour of being soft on it. He used a very emotive video to show that - a pensioner giving a tragic account of how his wife was murdered in front of him by a criminal in their house. But that could happen under any government, and it could be seen as a slightly cheap way of using somebody's tragic circumstances.\"</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>Congratulations to James Donally, who - unlike many entrants - was able to recall the slogan of last week's Labour party conference, A Better Life for All. \"I think you have to let me win as I must be the only Backbencher subscriber living in Turkmenistan, whose President for Life is not short of a catchy slogan himself.

Backbencher readers will recall that after the grilling a sympathetic Mr Brunson asked the ex-PM about the more troublesome elements in his party - the \"b*****ds\", of whom Silky was one.</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; NO TRUCK WITH THE EU</b></p> <p>It was bad enough submitting to the interrogation of the European parliament in Brussels this week. Much worse, however, was the headline in Tuesday's Le Monde: \"Peter Mandelson sera l'un des 'poids lourds' de l'equipe Barroso\" - which, roughly translated, means that Mandy will be the HGV of the new European commission. Heavyweight is one thing, but being compared to a lorry is another.

  "The September 11 2001 attacks on the US represented such an unprecedented form of terrorism that the British government was forced to take strong action to protect its citizens, the attorney general told the House of Lords today. <p>Lord Goldsmith QC - representing the government in a case brought by nine foreign nationals currently being held without charge under emergency anti-terror laws - said the UK was under threat from Islamist extremists.</p> <p>The attorney general said the power to detain without trial, which meant the UK had to opt out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights, had been a response to the threat posed by a group of foreign nationals who had no immigration rights to be in the UK. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said the government would have been entitled to deport the men but, for the time being, could not do so because of concern over their human rights. He added that the men faced death or torture in their own countries and were seeking asylum in Britain.</p> <p>\"To protect the human rights of the millions of British residents and those whose human rights the government has a duty to protect, we took the view that, if these people cannot be deported, they should not be allowed to roam free on the streets, and so they had to be detained,\" he said. </p> <p>\"This was not a step taken lightly. The government believes it was a legitimate and appropriate response to protect the human rights of the suspected international terrorists by not exporting them to death and torture, and to protect the human rights of citizens here.\" </p> <p>The nine, who have been held for three years, are seeking a declaration from a panel of nine law lords that the UK's derogation (opting out) from article five of the convention on human rights, which guarantees liberty, was unlawful. </p> <p>The government took the step in order bring in the internment powers contained in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act shortly after the attacks on New York and Washington. </p> <p>In order to make the derogation lawful, the government must prove that a threat was posed by international terrorism to national security and the life of the nation. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said both the special immigration appeals commission, which reviewed the detainees' cases, and the court of appeal had come to the conclusion that the conditions for opting out had been met. </p> <p>He said the September 11 attacks were unmatched in their scale of human and physical destruction, with 65 Britons among the 3,000 victims, and demonstrated the extent of the threat against western democracies.</p> <p>\"These events required the government of this country to assess the threat to the UK and what measures it was necessary to take to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks of unparalleled magnitude,\" he added. </p> <p>The attorney general said discussions to assess that threat had taken place at the highest political level, and it was realised that the threat to the UK - as the closest ally of the US - was grave. It had increased when the UK joined the US in military action in Iraq, he added. </p> <p>\"Everyone in this country is relieved that there has not been an attack on the UK - but that is no indication that there is not a threat and may or may not be an indication of the effectiveness of the measures taken,\" he said. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said the threat to the UK had not diminished, adding it \"must be accepted that al-Qaida plans further attacks\". </p> <p>The test of whether there was a national emergency did not require the country to be on the brink of war or civil war or after a national disaster, he said. </p> <p>\"If one looks at the imminent threat of this new sort of terrorist attack, this is plainly an emergency threatening the life of the nation. The government was justified in taking the action that it did.\" The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p>The government's target to increase the number of students from state schools in top universities could be in breach of human rights legislation, according to research published today.</p> <p>Top universities and independent schools have welcomed the study, which they said showed that institutions like Oxford and Cambridge should be freed of their targets to take more students from state schools.</p> <p>Professor Alan Smithers, a education expert from the University of Buckingham who led the research, concluded that it would be \"inherently unfair\" for universities to select students on the basis of their school type, and that universities rejecting candidates from independent schools could face legal action for breaking human rights laws.</p> <p>His study also acknowledged that state school pupils performed better at university than their public school peers when it came to improving on their A-level grades. </p> <p>Last week, official figures showed that Oxford and Cambridge had missed their \"benchmark\" targets for admitting a certain proportion of candidates from state schools. Both universities took just over half their students from state schools, falling about 20% short of their benchmarks.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education and Skills said: \"These performance indicators are intended to help institutions and improve their performance, they are not league tables, they are not targets and admissions policies remain the responsibility of the universities.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Oxford University said: \"Oxford has one of the most rigorous admissions procedures in the country, ensuring that at the point of selection students are selected solely on the basis of academic merit and potential. </p> <p>\"This academic ability is measured through a range of factors, including subject-specific aptitude testing, written work, interviews, and existing qualifications (predicted or actual). </p> <p>\"We have absolutely no intention of admitting students on any basis other than academic ability and potential. Progress in the diversity of our student body must come from increasingly diverse applications, not from systematically biasing in favour of certain students. </p> <p>She added: \"We work very hard to increase applications from under-represented groups, averaging one access activity for every working day of the year.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Universities UK said: \"Universities are committed to fair access and will base admissions on each applicant's merit, achievements and potential.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"Reviews and research on current admissions practices in higher education acknowledge that generally there is no evidence of bias against students from particular schools and colleges.</p> <p>\"Although prior educational attainment remains the best single predictor of success in higher education, it is appropriate for institutions to adopt a holistic approach to admissions through the consideration of other factors such as the context of applicants' achievements, including background, other relevant skills and indicators of potential.&#xa0; </p> <p>\"This does not mean that it would be appropriate to treat one applicant automatically more or less favourably simply by virtue of his or her background, including the type of school he or she attended.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Professor Smithers was commissioned to examine the issue by the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) and the Girls' Schools Association (GSA). </p> <p>His report, released today at the HMC's annual conference in St Andrews, said: \"There is no case for instituting formal procedures to secure the entry of maintained school pupils on lower entry qualifications. </p> <p>\"Indeed, to do so in blanket fashion could well make university admissions less fair than they are now.\" </p> <p>It went on: \"Taking account of factors such as school type may be in breach of the Human Rights Act.\" </p> <p>Presenting the report, Philip Evans, from the HMC, said he did not see the need for benchmarks at all. </p> <p>\"Once you start to treat a candidate as a representative of a particular group you move into the danger of individual unfairness,\" he said. </p> <p>Cynthia Hall, the president of the GSA, said most universities did not have the time or money to interview candidates and get a complete picture of them. </p> <p>\"Instead, they are saying 'do it on a quota of independent to state schools'. We say this is fundamentally unfair and is not based on any proper research material.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>What is Parmalat alleged to have done?</strong><br> Parmalat, an Italian company specialising in long-life milk, is suspected of having perpetrated a massive fraud. Billions of euros have gone missing from its books in a scandal that has drawn parallels with the collapse of Enron, the US energy giant. </p> <p>The company has admitted that the true level of its debt is \u20ac14.3bn (\u00a310bn) - eight times more than it claimed. Italian prosecutors are trying to convince a judge to order trials for 29 people, ranging from Parmalat's founder to former financial officers, accountants and lawyers.</p> <p><strong>How did Parmalat's crisis start?</strong><br> The questions began in December 2003 when Parmalat had difficulty making a \u20ac150m bond payment. The company, which had 36,000 employees, was supposed to have been been sitting on \u20ac3.95bn in cash, so Italian bankers were puzzled by its predicament. Parmalat's founder, Calisto Tanzi, brushed bankers' concerns aside, saying the company had a bit of a liquidity problem.</p> <p><strong>How did the crisis escalate?</strong><br> Parmalat's problems quickly reached epic proportions after it made the extraordinary admission that the \u20ac3.9bn it thought it had in the bank did not exist. The money was supposedly in a Bank of America account held by Bonlat, a subsidiary based in the Cayman Islands. But Bank of America said there was no such account.</p> <p><strong>Where were the auditors?</strong><br> Parmalat's primary auditor was Deloitte &amp; Touche, but the Milan branch of Grant Thornton dealt with some of the company's subsidiaries, including Bonlat. When Grant Thornton checked with Bank of America, the auditor received a letter on Bank of America letterhead confirming the existence of the account. However, Bank of America said the letter was forged. </p> <p>The Italian units of Bank of America and Deloitte &amp; Touche are among the defendants prosecutors want put on trial, as is the former Italian affiliate of Grant Thornton, which the auditor has now got rid of. Two partners of that affiliate have been sent for trial in January. They are the first individuals to be prosecuted in the scandal.</p> <p><strong>Did the money exist in the first place?</strong><br> Investigators have been trying to find out. There are suspicions that company executives invented contracts that were shown to the banks in order to raise cash that was then used to cover up day-to-day losses. </p> <p>\"The money was there in the first place but it got lost along the way,\" a US analyst said. Some press reports say as much as \u20ac10bn has disappeared from the company's accounts. </p> <p><strong>Did anybody harbour suspicions about Parmalat?</strong><br> Some analysts did voice concern about Parmalat's rapid expansion. The company started as a peddler of prosciutto in a small northern Italian hamlet but grew into a dairy giant selling long-lasting milk and other milk products in 30 countries, and employing 36,000 people. The global expansion started with an acquisition in Brazil in the mid-1970s. </p> <p><strong>Did the expansion run into trouble?</strong><br> As the company grew, so did its debt. It was bailed out in 1990, with the Tanzi family giving up 49% of its control of the company. </p> <p>Parmalat returned to the acquisition trail a few years later and bought US food giant Beatrice Foods in 1997. Other deals followed, taking the company into China, Australia and Mexico. In the process, Parmalat's debts grew to \u20ac6bn, but investors kept buying the company's bonds on the strength of its supposed cash pile. But at least one analyst thought the bonds too risky, describing them as \"junk bonds in drag\" two years ago. </p> <p><strong>Who were the architects of Parmalat's growth?</strong><br> The company was founded by Calisto Tanzi, a university dropout who transformed a family business, Calisto Tanzi &amp; Sons - Salamis and Preserves into an organisation hailed as one of Europe's biggest corporate success stories. </p> <p>Along the way, he relied on Fausto Tonna, who was the company's finance director for 16 years. \"Tonna was a bit of a peasant in his manners but had an extremely sharp mind for finances,\" said a banker who met him. If anyone has the answers it will be Mr Tanzi and Mr Tonna, who have both stepped down. </p> <p><strong>What happens to Parmalat now?</strong><br> The company has sought protection from its creditors after the Italian government rushed through an emergency decree that would allow companies to apply to the industry ministry to appoint an administrator with immediate powers. </p> <p>Enrico Bondi was appointed special administrator of the company in December 2003. Mr Bondi won acclaim for handling the break-up of the Ferruzzi family's business empire, Italy's biggest corporate crisis of the 1990s. </p> <p><strong>Will Parmalat survive?</strong><br> Parmalat is now in administration, so it enjoys protection from its creditors. But at some point it will probably have to sell off many of the companies it has acquired over the years. Analysts say the company was quietly seeking to offload assets in Mexico, Brazil and the US up to two years ago in an attempt to reduce its debts, but it was asking prices nobody wanted to pay. </p> <p>It will be different now, with Parmalat in a much weaker bargaining position. Global players such as Nestl\u00e9 and Danone would be the most likely candidates to pick up some of the Parmalat pieces. Parmalat will probably survive, but in much shrunken form. </p> <p><strong>What financial impact will the scandal have?</strong><br> Shares in the company, which once had a market value of \u20ac1.8bn, are worthless, so millions of investors are out of pocket. Bank of America is thought to have provided between $150m (\u00a384m) and $250m in loans to Parmalat, but those are trivial sums for America's third biggest bank.</p>",
  "<p>It's conker season again, and every morning around the horse chestnut tree near my children's school there are eager hands waiting to pick up the overnight droppings. But the hands aren't the tiny ones you might expect: most of the people filling their bags with the shiny brown nuts are mummies and daddies, not children. \"I do wish they'd play conkers,\" my friend Alison sighs. \"We loved it when I was a kid - I remember how much fun it was, soaking them in vinegar and then baking them in the oven in the hope of producing a champion. But my boys can never be bothered to go to all that trouble - the most they do is pick a few up and then discard them later in favour of a computer game.\" </p> <p>This week's news story about the headteacher who is allowing his pupils to play conkers only while supervised and wearing protective goggles has brought hoots of laughter at school gates up and down the country, but it's more sad than funny. Most of us, like Alison, would be only too pleased if our children took an hour or two off from the telly to play a wholesome, fun game like conkers - some of us, like the parents I see near my children's school, even go to the slightly desperate lengths of harvesting them in the hope of revitalising a dying country pursuit. </p> <p>Now, though, we're being told that it's dangerous: many schools have banned conkers, some on the grounds that kids can get hit in the eye, others because they fear for children with nut allergies. But according to Roger Vincent of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, there is no record of any conker-induced hospital admissions, and the Anaphylaxis Campaign says it's not aware of any severe reactions to conkers among children with nut allergies. At one of the few schools where conkers are welcomed, Woodlands Junior School in Tonbridge, Kent, there have been no unfortunate conker incidents of any kind. </p> <p>So why the fuss? According to Frank Furedi, professor of sociology at the University of Kent, conker worries are one more brick in the wall of what he calls paranoid parenting (he has written a book of the same name, outlining his fears for a society that wraps its children up in so much cotton wool that it risks suffocating them). But his real concern about this controversy is that it's a sign of parents going along with wider paranoia - and an illustration of how difficult it can be to swim against the tide. \"What I've noticed over the last few years is that occasionally you get a ripple or a backlash and parents are shocked or outraged at how far we're going in overprotecting our children,\" he says. \"But then within a short time what was outrageous is seen as 'common sense'. It happened a few years ago when the first schools said they were going to ban parents from videoing nativity plays and football matches at school. At first parents reacted against it, but now they accept it. </p> <p>\"The other thing I'm very aware of is how great the pressure is to conform when you're a parent. My son Jacob, who is nine, is the only boy his age around here who is allowed to go to tennis or swimming on his own - I've had people knock on our door to say did we know he was out of the house by himself. And what I find is that if his friends are coming over, the parents ring to check that we won't be letting them out unaccompanied. You're very much expected to fall in line, whatever your own feelings.\" </p> <p>Furedi calls it tragic that so many parents today romanticise childhood, yearning for the simple pleasures of playground games such as conkers, when the reality for their children is so different. And it's not only urban life that has changed for the worse, he says: rural areas, like his own, are much the same. \"There might be more opportunities for freedom and play in the countryside, but the same regime of fear exists,\" he says. \"You hear of people who move to a place where there are more outside spaces, but then they never let their kids out of their sight to experience it.\" </p> <p>All of which raises the question: why have we allowed our fears, which are largely out of proportion or even groundless, to overshadow our children's lives so? It is only common sense to realise there is no way we can ever totally remove danger from their lives: tragic accidents happen in the most unlikely of circumstances, such as the terrible incident last week when two-year-old twins Betsy and William Woodbridge were crushed to death in their bedroom after they pulled a chest of drawers down on top of them during a game - their mother thought they were safely tucked in bed having a nap at the time. </p> <p>So freak accidents will always happen: and while we busy ourselves trying to prevent them, the real danger around the corner for society as a whole is the obesity and ill health that come as a result of a too inactive, too mollycoddled childhood. While we try to plug the tiny gaps in our children's safety portfolio, we are failing to grapple with the huge dangers that threaten them with early death, heart disease and cancer. </p> <p>The fact is, parenting is dominated by paradoxes: and one of the keenest of all is walking the line between keeping children safe, and allowing them to experience - and so learn to deal with - pain, fear and danger. No parent is happy at the sight of a child with a bruised knee, a torn jumper or a cut finger: but sometimes that's the price that has to be paid for a small adventure with a big lesson.</p>",
  "<p>Tomorrow at 4pm a high court judge will rule on whether 11-month-old Charlotte Wyatt should be put on a ventilator next time her breathing fails (as it has already done three times). Charlotte was born three months early and is blind, deaf and, her doctors say, \"in continuing pain\". She doesn't have much of a life. As one of her doctors told the court last week: \"She is permanently sedated, living in a plastic box with a tube up her nose and blasted with gas. Intermittently she is stabbed with needles.\" If she goes on a ventilator again, things will only get worse for her, and besides, she is not expected to survive her babyhood. Darren and Debbie Wyatt, however, want everything possible done to save Charlotte: they are not ready for her to die. </p> <p>The commentators have come down heavily on the side of the doctors, as the judge probably will. After all, it is hard to argue that a baby with no hope of a future should be put through further suffering. A common assumption is that Charlotte's parents must be mad. In fact every news report on this case has made a point of mentioning that the Wyatts are Christians, and most people I know assume them to be religious fanatics. </p> <p>It has come to a pretty pass, in a land studded with churches, that the word \"Christian\" should set off so many alarm bells in such a context, but that is another matter. The point is that there is an explanation other than religious fervour for the Wyatts wanting to prolong their daughter's miserable existence. </p> <p>My son was born early, and although he was home within two months and is absolutely fine now, I can understand why the Wyatts have not gone meekly along with the views of their no doubt well-intentioned doctors. I might not have made the same decisions as they have made, but I can sympathise. </p> <p>When their daughter was born, the Wyatts would have had no control over events - Charlotte, who weighed a pound and was five inches long, would have been whisked away to a neonatal intensive care unit. The doctors would have warned them of the risks of disability and death, but they would not have referred to incubators as \"plastic boxes\", or talked about \"stabbing\" Charlotte with needles. All that technology would have seemed miraculous then, and the Wyatts would have hoped desperately for the best. After all, most three-month-early babies do go home. </p> <p>The Wyatts would also have felt frightened and powerless. When you have a baby in an incubator, you feel, initially, that the baby is only nominally yours, and that there is nothing you can do to help. You feel like an intruder. The nurses will tell you that, eventually, you will become your child's advocate, but in the face of your own terror, and their dazzling professionalism, and with a tiny, frail creature lying between you in a horrifying mess of tubes and wires, it is impossible to imagine. </p> <p>But the day comes. As you watch shift after shift after shift change, the constant alarms and the rows of tiny babies lose their power to horrify, and you begin to realise that you really do know better than anyone whether your child likes lying on his back or his side, or whether his oxygen tube is too tight, or if his blanket is too scratchy. You do become your child's advocate. I only had two months of it, but it was long enough for me to realise that busy staff, however wonderful, cannot possibly know as much about a child as a parent who is there, day after day, watching and worrying themselves sick over every tiny change. </p> <p>The Wyatts have been at this for 11 months, with a baby who has been going down the hill, not up it: simply to have kept going so long is an unimaginable feat of strength, courage and love. They talk about the \"good days\" when they have been able to hold their daughter, and when she has seemed to have been calmed by it. They say that Charlotte recognises them. They have become her advocates - and they believe they know what is best for her. </p> <p>Darren talked to the court about Charlotte going outside one day. The two-horned holy grail for parents in such circumstances is to take baby outside - the normality of it! - and to take baby home. Even if the court rules against the Wyatts, I hope that they do get to take her outside, so that \"she can have the feel of fresh air on her skin\", as the Wyatts' lawyer put it. Or better yet, that they do get to take her home, for however short a time. You never know - the Wyatts might swap a day or two at home with Charlotte for a couple of years in hospital. They have known her so long now, and loved her so much, that bringing her home for the first time might just make it OK to say goodbye to her.</p>",
  "<p>Eight or nine years ago, I was sitting at the back of a packed conference hall, listening to an Australian policy wizard describe the theoretical grounding of an exhaustive new study on ... what was it that time? Famine? Fathers? Aids? Fair trade? While stifling a yawn, I glanced over my shoulder to find Bob Geldof sitting next to me. He was making a face, as if he had just eaten a piece of rotten meat. He pointed at the speaker. \"What the hell is he talking about?\" I stupidly tried to explain. He cut me off in mid-sentence, muttered something about shite, gathered up his things and left. How I envied him, as I sat there pinned politely to my chair. </p> <p>\"Make it simple, or else\" - that has always been Geldof's core message. If there is suffering and injustice in the world, just get out there and fix it. He is a genius at exposing bureaucratic hypocrisy, and even better at igniting interest in long-lost causes. As any fundraiser can tell you, one word from Bob Geldof is worth a thousand cheques. So who's going to complain if he gets the facts jumbled in that little head of his or sounds off before he has done his homework? </p> <p>Well, I am, actually. Because now he has gone and made himself the patron saint of marriage and children. \"I know it's uncool,\" he says in a documentary to be aired next week, but the time has come to think about the little ones: \"We imagine ourselves to be free, but we should not be free to destroy others, especially children.\" Once we bring them into the world, we should stay together, for their sake, no matter what. \"This marriage stuff is a serious thing,\" he says. \"It is not to be entered into and dissolved on a whim and to make light of it is a profound mistake. Yet this is exactly what the law allows us to do.\" </p> <p>Hmmm. Isn't that stretching it a little, Bob? Rock-star millionaires with hotshot lawyers can, I'm sure, enter into and dissolve just about anything on a whim, but the law keeps lesser libertines on a pretty short lead. Especially if you havechildren, there is considerable (and growing) social pressure to seek a happier resolution in a very sad office at Relate. If your marriage fails anyway, there are the long, drawn-out negotiations about children, houses, banks, jobs, and schools, all excruciatingly painful, all overseen by lawyers and other helping professionals. You do eventually get your freedom back. But it never quite feels that way, does it, if you are depressed and disgraced and still smarting from all the lectures, and both trying to be parents to your children on half your former income. </p> <p>Poverty, heartbreak, exhaustion, public censure and long, lonely nights. That's what divorce brings most people in the short term, and no one, not even Bob Geldof, would go through this hell unless he had to. But here's the catch. He doesn't seem to think he did have to. Although he half admits he was half responsible for his own horrific divorce (we live in a \"because-I'm-worth-it society ... we hop from product to product, channel to channel, station to station, and most damagingly, lover to lover, trading each one in for a new model as soon as passion fades\"), he goes on to remind us that 70% of divorces are initiated by women. We can fix this mess, he tells us, by getting women to lower their expectations. </p> <p>By asking less for ourselves, you see, we'll get more for the little ones. \"The truth of every study is clear - dual-parent upbringing produces healthier, better-educated children.\" This, of course, is the mantra of the family court reform movement - and Bob will have more to say on this in a second C4 programme next week - with proper reform, dual-parent upbringing can go on even after divorce. In the first documentary, though, he is accentuating the negative. Divorce and you are not just condemning your children to poor results but making it more likely that they will commit crimes, go to prison, and commit suicide. </p> <p>God forbid any of this should happen to his own little ones. They have been through such hell that I feel it would be unkind to warn their father about stones and glass houses, or to remind anyone else that the Geldof household has never been big on consistency. Remember those lovely childcare books Paula Yates wrote before she ran off with Michael Hutchence? While she was telling us how to raise really great children on a really huge income, she did some pretty vicious riffs on selfish working mothers - even though she herself was still appearing regularly on Channel 4. </p> <p>But never mind. She meant well. Sort of. No one ever accused her of being a sociologist. But when celebs mouth off about the virtues of traditional marriage, they do draw heavily (if also wildly and rather sloppily) on real studies by real sociologists with overt political agendas. So it's useful to know who these puppeteers are and what they stand for. </p> <p>Many of the clear-sighted studies to which Sir Bob refers can ultimately be traced back to the Institute for American Values. Founded by the eminent David Blankenhorn, it hopes to gener ate a nationwide marriage movement, and over the past few years, its members have churned out a great library of honourably researched, academically correct books on the evils of divorce, the virtues of marriage, and the wisdom of the traditional family in which the woman lowers her expectations for the common good. Their authors have found happy homes in our own rightwing thinktanks. The most passionate proponent of their ideas in Britain is Melanie Phillips, who, when the Daily Mail ran Sir Bob's comments from the documentary on Monday, used him as a peg for a more erudite full-page rant of her own. Drawing extensively (if also vaguely) from a study conducted by the Centre for Social Justice, the pro-marriage thinktank founded by Iain Duncan Smith, she urged the Conservative party to stamp out this \"libertine free-for-all\" from which \"all our social ills\" derive. </p> <p>She has been in the game long enough to take her allies as they come, but this is just about as strange as it gets. Joan of Arc in bed with the Boomtown Rat? She must be truly desperate. But together they have influence and can do a great deal of harm. They touch on serious matters that affect all of us, matters we need to discuss openly, carefully and honestly, without having to worry about rightwing fanatics jamming their agendas down our throats. </p> <p>Because, yes, divorce is hell. Most especially if you are the child in the middle. But divorces keep happening, and 70% of those who initiate them turn out to be women, and possibly, just possibly, it's not because of their or anyone else's selfish \"soap-opera expectations\" but something deeper, something that cannot be remedied by a quick return to female selflessness. So what could it be? It's a complex question, as sociologists like to say. It would be hard to know where to begin. But as long as Bob and the Blankenhorns are dominating this debate, it's unlikely we really will.</p>",
  "<p>Manchester United chief executive David Gill has called for Fifa to compensate clubs who release player for international duty.</p> <p>In a move likely to further sour relations between Europe's top clubs and the game's governing bodies, Manchester United and other G14 clubs have lodged a formal complaint against Fifa to the Swiss competition authorities. </p> <p>\"The fact the governing bodies can generate vast amounts of money in sponsorship and TV revenue through an asset they get for free is something that just cannot continue,\" Gill said.</p> <p>\"We are waiting to see what Fifa's response is to the complaint we have put forward to the competition authorities but there has to be scope for Fifa and Uefa to slice some of the profits they make from major tournaments to repay the clubs who provide the assets which provide the income.\"</p> <p>The conflict has been brought to Manchester United's doorstep this week with the England team training at United's Carrington facilities ahead of their World Cup qualifier on Saturday. </p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson was forced to abandon training having lost 18 members of his first team squad. United's recent injury problems were compounded by Louis Saha and Gary Neville returning injured from international duty.</p> <p>Gill was quick to stress that he was in favour of competitive international football, but that new guidelines had to be drawn up.</p> <p>\"We are not saying you shouldn't have championships.</p> <p>\"As a Premier League club, we want a successful England team and the competitions they play in increase football's popularity around the world,\" he said. </p> <p>'If you look at Uefa, 82% of the revenue generated from the Champions League is distributed as prize money, while the other 18% is retained for putting on the competition, their offices and good causes. It is transparent and the clubs understand it.</p> <p>\"But if you look at an analysis of what they made out of Euro 2004 the indications are they could use some of that money to reimburse the clubs.\"</p> <p>Gill's comments come a week after Sepp Blatter, who has now cut off contact with the G14 group, warned against national football associations being overrun by the self-interest of those clubs at the top of the pile.</p> <p>\"For wealthy clubs to try to emasculate the international game by seizing control of a national football association - as I read that some fear they are trying to do in England is unacceptable,\" Blatter said.</p>",

  "<p>An important (some say the most important) presidential election is imminent in the US, and what promises to be an interesting general election is just over the horizon in the UK. </p> <p>What part, if any, will undergraduates play in these great affairs of state? The auguries, in America at least, are not good. The proportion of students eligible to vote for their president who actually do vote for their president is wretched. It stands at around 36%. They really don't care if it's President Chalk or President Cheese who becomes their commander in chief. </p> <p>With a view to prodding the student electorate out of its traditional apathy, an amendment was added to the 1998 Higher Education Act obliging institutions to supply voter registration forms and to urge students to exercise their constitutional rights. One of those rights is the choice of voting either home or away - where you were brought up or where you are currently enrolled. </p> <p>According to a survey in last month's Chronicle of Higher Education, institutional compliance with the 1998 act has been lamentable. A third of American universities have not done what the law requires. They really don't care. </p> <p>Even where the university does care, students can face an assault course on the way to the polling booth. Local election officials tend not to like these fly-by-night voters. Those with long memories can recall what happened in the city of Ann Arbor, in the early 1970s. Having been permitted to vote in local elections, students joyously decriminalised marijuana. For a few glorious years, until the moral majority reasserted itself, the maximum penalty for possession around the University of Michigan was a $5 fine. </p> <p>Today's students, even though they tend to be more responsible than the UM potheads, will quite likely be confronted with deterringly complex qualification forms (a technique used in the South for generations to disenfranchise black voters). Officials sometimes object to a dormitory address being a home. In some districts students are required to validate residence by matching the address on their driving licence with that of their university (invariably different). Even if they pass that test, hopeful voters may have to demonstrate an \"intention to remain\" in the university or its environs after their course of study. </p> <p>A counter-attack has been mounted by partisan organisations with a special interest in mobilising young voters (young Democratic voters, principally). Rock the Vote has dispatched its euphonious buses to the big campuses. On its <a href=\"http://www.rockthevote.org\" target_new\">website</a> it offers an online voter registration tool for students (free of charge). Rock the Vote explodes such \"myths\" as \"you might lose your financial aid if you change where you are registered to vote\". Thanks to Rock the Vote, John Kerry, like Bill Clinton before him, has locked in the MTV watchers. </p> <p>Given the huge congregations of undergraduates in many American universities, and given Coleridge's law that man is born liberal and dies conservative, a mass turn-out by students could be critical in 2004. Even more so since there are defining policy differences between the candidates. George Bush has primarily directed his attention to school reform, leaving higher education to look after itself. His theological antagonism to stem cell research and his conviction that \"the jury is still out on evolution\" alienates the university scientific community. His affected disdain for books and big words alienates the humanists. Among male undergraduates, President Bush's increasingly bloody and unpopular war has raised fears of a draft after November's dust subsides. </p> <p>Mr Kerry, by contrast, holds out the biggest package of university reforms since President Clinton. He promises to enlarge the Pell grant scheme (financial aid for disadvantaged students). He promises tax credits to relieve the \"middle-class squeeze\" on parents, faced with ballooning tuition fees. By promising a boost to the \"Americorps\" programme (the revamped Peace Corps) Mr Kerry has identified himself as a peacenik, not a warmonger. Students like that. They may even switch off their MTV and vote for it. </p> <p>The British politician who has most shrewdly assessed the value of the student vote is Ken Livingstone. In the June 2004 elections, unlike the other mayoral candidates, he went out of his way to court the capital's undergraduates.</p> <p>In an \"exclusive interview\" with the London Student newspaper, when asked what he had done for its readers to earn their support, Mr Livingstone replied (with dubious arithmetic, but an irresistible appeal to the pocket): \"Two hundred thousand extra students are getting cheaper fares - that matters. Just my [sic] cutting fares for students can put three or four quid in someone's pocket for the week and that can make the difference between being hungry or not.\"</p> <p>Although he himself had never been to university Mr Livingstone was, he protested, a (rebel) student at heart: \"In 1969 - after all the great demonstrations and upheavals of '68 - I came to the conclusion that you would not change the world from the streets. You actually needed to do what Daniel Cohn-Bendit - Danny the Red - called 'The long march through the institutions' - and here I am 35 years later.\"</p> <p>Although he no longer marches through them, the streets around the University of London are easier to walk around nowadays. Since Mr Livingstone was elected, the whole Bloomsbury precinct has been handsomely pedestrianised. The initiative to civilise the student quarter originated, one suspects, in the mayoral parlour. Students like Ken because (as they perceive) he likes them. Even when not electioneering, he writes a regular column for the London Student. The analysis has not been done, but I suspect it was London students who swung the last, closely-contested, mayoral election his way. </p> <p>If, as the Labour party grandly promises, the student body swells to the talismanic 50% of school leavers, their votes, concentrated in city-sized campuses, will be a significant force in future British elections - assuming, of course, that like their American counterparts, British students will be able to cast their vote where they study. With this demographic in mind, there is a backward-looking reform that the government should consider. From the early 17th century, Oxford and Cambridge had their own members of parliament - voted in by members of the university. In 1867, the University of London got its MP, and in 1918 the big redbrick universities theirs. </p> <p>En masse, the university members formed an articulate, if somewhat narrow-minded, lobby. They were abolished in 1950, with all the other special interest members. Given the increasing university population over the next decades it would surely make sense to revive this ancient institution. Who knows, it might get out the student vote. And even, perhaps, shut the noisy buggers up a bit.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I don't want to spend a lot...</strong></p> <p><strong>Head Tri-Tech 6000</strong><br> <strong>Price:</strong> \u00a339.99<br> <strong> What they say:</strong> Specially designed to reduce vibration, and ultra lightweight, this recreational racket will suit a wide player range.<br> <strong>Who uses it:</strong> Erm... <br> <strong> What we thought:</strong> This racket does exactly what it says on the tin: the Tri-Tech system does indeed reduce vibrations, but you will not forget how little you paid for this slightly tinny feeling number - more experienced players will wonder where exactly they've put the sweetspot. Nonetheless, it's lightweight and easy to use, so for beginners reluctant to invest just yet, it's worth a try. <br> <strong>Our rating:</strong> 7/10<br></p> <p><strong>Prince TTT Sierra Ti OS</strong><br> <strong>Price:</strong> \u00a359.99<br> <strong>What they say:</strong> \"The unique balanced weighting system focuses our Triple Threat material in three critical locations. The end result is perfect balance and stability in a racquet that will improve your game.\"<br> <strong>Who uses it:</strong> No tour pros, this is very much an improver's racket.<br> <strong>What we thought:</strong> Triple Threat technology has appeared in rackets that are \u00a3100 more expensive than the Sierra, so to have it available in a racket under \u00a360 means this has a lot going for it - including decent shock absorption and a nice feel, although contact can feel a bit tinny at times.<br> <strong>Our rating:</strong> 8.25/10<br></p> <p><strong>I don't mind forking out a fair bit...</strong></p> <p><strong>Head i.extreme</strong><br> <strong>Price:</strong> \u00a389.99<br> <strong> What they say:</strong> This racquet offers optimum control for performance players after aggressive and powerful play. <br> <strong>Who uses it:</strong> Andre Agassi, in practice.<br> <strong> What we thought:</strong> Not the lightest racket tested but if you know how to hit a ball you will enjoy a long and prosperous relationship together. Huge sweetspot, comfortably midweight, you can just feel that this racket is a little bit special.<br> <strong>Second opinion </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.tennis-warehouse.com\">www.tennis-warehouse.com</a>): \"The i.Extreme is a lighter weight, control-oriented offering from Head. It's an attractive choice for intermediate to advanced players with fast swings seeking added control in a manoeuvrable racquet. It's designed to offer a stiffer, more crisp frame response. Head's Anti.Torsion system in the throat provides enhanced stability for added control.\" <br> <strong>Our rating:</strong> 9/10<br></p> <p><strong>Wilson Hammer Tour</strong><br> <strong>Price:</strong> \u00a3129.99<br> <strong> What they say:</strong> Part of a new generation of superlight Hammer rackets and featuring Isogrid technology, the Hammer Tour provides great playability and a racket to rely on. <br> <strong>Who uses it:</strong> Super Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne and Lindsay Davenport.<br> <strong> What we thought:</strong> A good player will love this racket for the element of control and precision it can add to their game - though it's not quite as \"superlight\" as they say. And be warned: this is not for the average player, and vibration control could be better. <br> <strong>Second opinion</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.tennis-warehouse.com\">www.tennis-warehouse.com</a>): \"A solid player's racquet, the Hammer Tour replaces the popular Hammer 5.2 as the go to player's racquet - it feels more evenly balanced and not as light and whippy as the 5.2 during play. The Hammer Tour has an almost universal appeal in the player's racquet category as the swingweight is substantial enough for baseliners, yet manoeuvrable and stable enough to please net rushers and big servers. Power is controllable, but slightly more generous than other player's racquets.\" <br> <strong>Our rating:</strong> 8/10<br></p> <p><strong>Prince Tour NXG Mid Plus</strong><br> <strong>Price:</strong> \u00a3139.99<br> <strong> What they say:</strong> \"A new and improved version of the top selling TT Graphite, the NXG Mid plus offers a large amount of control and feel for the serious tournament player.\"<br> <strong>Who uses it:</strong> Clay court wizards Juan Carlos Ferrero and Guillermo Coria.<br> <strong> What we thought:</strong> If you're a decent player and want an all-round racket, this is ideal. It's got a nice mix of control and power and, as with most Prince rackets, a lovely, almost velvety, feel. Highly recommended - although it's not for beginners and improvers.<br> <strong>Second opinion </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.tennis-warehouse.com\">www.tennis-warehouse.com</a>):<br> \"The Mid is best suited for aggressive players. Strong players with good technique will not be left wanting for direction and placement with the NXG Mid, but must be ready for a sharp drop in power on balls hit in the upper hoop. Fans of midsize racquets should definitely give this one a try, as the reward from the small sweetspot is very sweet, indeed. With good swingspeed comes the ability to hit solid, heavy shots from all areas of the court.\" <strong>Our rating:</strong> 9.5/10<br></p> <p><strong>I should like to lavish vast amounts of money on my tennis career...</strong></p> <p><strong>Wilson nCode nSix-One Tour 90 Racquets</strong><br> <strong>Price:</strong>\u00a3149.99<br> <strong>What they say:</strong> According to Wilson, the nCoded racquet contains \"nano-sized silicone crystals which permeate the voids between the carbon fibres\". This nano technology apparently creates racquets that are two times stronger, two times more stable and up to 22% more powerful than ordinary racquets.<br> <strong>Who uses it:</strong> World No1 Roger Federer, no less.<br> <strong>What we thought:</strong> You'll either love or hate this beast. First impressions aren't entirely favourable - it feels like a brick (it's significantly heavier than most other rackets) and the sweetspot is smaller than a undernourished mouse. But once you get your timing right it plays like a dream. Wimbledon 2009, anyone?<br> <strong>Second opinion</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.tennis-warehouse.com\">www.tennis-warehouse.com</a>): \"We found the nSix-One Tour 90 to be the most demanding racquet we've playtested in 2004. We think this one is definitely best suited to advanced players who take to the court on a regular basis. With its hefty 12.4 ounce weight the nSix-One Tour 90 rewards strong and accomplished players who can regularly find the sweetspot. If you are a classic striker of the ball, have good mechanics and are looking for a racquet that offers a lot of heft, plenty of control and that can be swung aggressively without fear of over-hitting, you might want to take this one for a test drive.\"<br> <strong>Our rating:</strong> 8.5/10 (for experience players), 1/10 if you're not.<br></p> <p><strong>Head Liquidmetal radical OS</strong><br> <strong>Price:</strong>\u00a3149.99<br> <strong>What they say:</strong> \"Each LiquidMetal section features a corrugated construction designed to further increase stiffness. More new technology comes to Head's latest Radical in the form of the Hydro Control grip system, which is designed to reduce moisture gathering between a player's palm and the racquet handle. The LiquidMetal Radical racquets are designed with the stronger intermediate to advanced player in mind.\"<br> <strong>Who uses it:</strong> Andre Agassi.<br> <strong>What we thought:</strong> The most serious challenger to the Prince Tour NXG Mid Plus, the radical OS is less powerful than Head's Liquidmetal 4 - which means you can take a full, fast swing without watching the ball lob out of play. It's a comfortable racket too, and although this playtester isn't a huge fan of over-sized rackets, this one was a hit.<br> <strong>Second opinion</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.tennis-warehouse.com\">www.tennis-warehouse.com</a>): \"The Liquidmetal Radical OS is a comfortable racquet that excelled at the net and turned in a solid performance everywhere else.

Perfectly balanced mid plus racquet. It's an ideal racquet for players with a moderate swing style and features Total Sweetspot Construction for more stability.\"<br> <strong>Who uses it:</strong> None of the big names, but Andre Agassi, Marat Safin and Gustavo Kuerten all use less powerful versions of the Liquidmetal series.<br> <strong> What we thought:</strong> If your arms are the size of drainpipes, and you need a little more oomph in your game, the Liquidmetal 4 is perfect. The large sweetspot and vibration dampeners also make it an excellent choice for any improver who's keen to kick on, or an expert-level player who needs more power.<br> <strong>Second opinion</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.tennis-warehouse.com\">www.tennis-warehouse.com</a>): \"The weight and balance of the racquet makes it easy to get around, and we noticed that a player need not take a long swing to generate power.

The sweetspot is so big, and so sweet, that you can virtually hit winners off the rim. Vibrations are almost eliminated, the racket is so light it feels like an extension of your arm. Players of any ability can pick this up and feel like they could take on Sharapova. It probably won't stop you getting thumped, mind.<br> <strong>Second opinion</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.tennis-warehouse.com\">www.tennis-warehouse.com</a>): \"Aggressive all court attacking players and baseliners with one-handed backhands will like it's manoeuvrability.

  "<p>Paul Signac's painting Against the Enamel of a Background Rhythmic with Beats and Angles, Tones and Colours, Portrait of M. F\u00e9lix F\u00e9n\u00e9on in 1890 is a manifesto for a new art and a new world. Its subject was a critic and anarchist who said that one day art will be part of the life of the working class, but first \"the revolution must get up steam and we must build a completely anarchist civilisation\". It is this terror suspect - F\u00e9n\u00e9on was arrested in 1894 after a wave of bomb attacks - who will greet visitors at the beginning of the displays at the new Museum of Modern Art, New York. </p> <p>Where do you begin the story of modernism? MoMA used to start with C\u00e9zanne, credited as cubist godfather by Picasso. But C\u00e9zanne lived a quiet life away from Paris. In starting their displays with Signac, MoMA make the origins of modern art more sociable - and political. </p> <p>It's a bold choice. But what about the date? 1890: it's neat, but perhaps a little late. In fact, it is very difficult to say when modernism \"began\". The convenience of C\u00e9zanne is that his formal innovations - so profoundly shaping cubism - are different in nature from the avant gardism that flourished in France from at least the mid-19th century. Is the radical manifesto of Signac's painting really that different from the one in Henri Fantin-Latour's Homage to Delacroix (1864) starring Whistler, Baudelaire and Manet? I think the first image of Parisian bohemia and the avant garde is by Delacroix: Liberty Leading the People (1830) has a raffish intellectual in a raked top hat joining the people on the barricades. </p> <p>Even Jacques-Louis David's Marat Assassinated has been proposed as the first modern painting, and convincingly, because the avant-garde values epitomised by F\u00e9n\u00e9on originate with the first, great French Revolution in 1789. But you can't have everything. MoMA's collection begins in the 1880s, not the 1780s. So F\u00e9n\u00e9on it is then.</p>",

  "With the chutzpah that doubtless comes from being paid millions, Sir Peter Davis, the former chairman of Sainsbury's, told a fringe meeting at the Labour conference last week that the government should do more to help companies pay pensions. Earlier this year, Davis was fired, only to walk away from the grocery store with a package worth \u00a32.6m, his salary to July next year (\u00a3550,000), share options (which will be worth a lot if his successor does what he failed to do) and unspecified contributions to a pension pot worth many further millions. <p>You could complain that he doesn't deserve the money, but, in this post-socialist age, no one much talks about the moral worth of work. A better point might be that pay and bonuses are extraordinarily random and puzzlingly unconnected to performance. According to a Loughborough University study, there is not even much of a relationship between performance bonuses and overall profitability.</p> <p>At least in theory, you can count profit, though executives pull the wool over non-executive directors' eyes. In the public sector, there may not be any numbers: how do you measure, for example, a chief executive's or a chief constable's performance in adding to \"community cohesion\"? Yet consultants get fat purporting to make comparisons between public and private sectors. Towers Perrin has taken a look at permanent secretaries for the Cabinet Office. Based on \"equivalent roles\", its study argues that permanent secretaries are worth nearly double their existing salaries.</p> <p>But talk to Income Data Services, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development or the Work Foundation - organisations with no interest in inflating rewards - and their experts wholeheartedly agree: who gets what is a lottery. Pay depends on history and precedent, whim, fashion and status as much as any vaunted market principle or, in the public sector, scientific job evaluation.</p> <p>Take the regulators. Anna Walker, chief executive of the Healthcare Commission, has nominal oversight of NHS (and some private) operations worth upwards of \u00a380bn a year. For that, she gets about \u00a3150,000. Stephen Carter, chief executive of the Office of Communications, has oversight of an industry worth about an eighth of the NHS turnover. He gets \u00a3370,000. Is the content of their jobs so vastly different? Probably not, but Ofcom was set up in a \"private sector\" context. Carter comes from a telecoms background, Walker from the civil service.</p> <p>The Treasury and Cabinet Office are making a joint submission on senior civil service pay to the Top Salaries Review Body, which also reports on generals and judges. The timing is unfortunate, with the Public and Commercial Services Union proposing strike action next month over job cuts. For ministers who would have to approve increases, a public relations disaster is in sight. A leaked version of the submission could be read as suggesting that permanent secretaries' bonuses should be boosted to reflect successful implementation of the efficiency review targets - more pay for cutting jobs, as the media spun it.</p> <p>So the permanent secretaries who presided over the build up of the \u00a320bn-worth of inefficiencies highlighted by the Gershon report are to be rewarded for cutting them back. Sounds like a win-win situation.</p> <p>What is mooted is a three-year lift in basic rewards and bonuses for the 4,000-strong senior civil service to balance them with the private sector. The argument is that executive pay has risen along with stock options, health and car allowances, which civil servants don't normally get. This would imply permanent secretary increases of over 80% - pushing the cabinet secretary from \u00a3205,000 to \u00a3385,000. The grade beneath the top would get a two-thirds raise, so a figure such as Richard McCarthy, the sustainable communities director in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, would see his salary increase to over \u00a3210,000.</p> <p>But where is the private sector comparison for director of sustainable communities? What is missing from the argument is any close study of how far senior staff in the public sector need to be grown as opposed to imported, and the role of higher salaries in signalling to those lower down the pecking order.</p> <p>Hamish Davidson, chairman of Veredus Executive Resourcing, argues that in local government the trend has been to favour local authority chief executive appointments from within the pool - people who know the ropes and can slot into a new council quickly, with speedy impact on comprehensive performance assessment ratings.</p> <p>That tends to push up pay rates, he argues. Recent surveys suggest the average chief executive now earns just over \u00a3100,000. There has however been a retreat from the \"funny money\" salaries on offer a year ago. Bradford had been prepared to pay \u00a3200,000-plus to import a superstar. This year, it turned its back on the bright lights and recruited its own acting chief executive, Philip Robinson, home-grown talent who had joined the council as an 18-year old trainee. He will get just under \u00a3140,000.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Walker edits Public, the Guardian's magazine for public executives.

  "<p>Rebel shareholders at music festival and gig venue group Mean Fiddler have blocked plans to hand control of the group to internet entrepreneur Richard Clingen. </p> <p>The company, which operates the Reading Festival and promotes tours for pop stars such as Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, yesterday said it was unwinding a share placing which would have transformed the company's share register. It would have allowed founder Vince Power to sell his 35% stake and open the door to several new institutional investors. </p> <p>The placing, conducted a week ago, was to be quickly followed by the acquisition of Mr Clingen's business Media Internet Telecom, with which Mean Fiddler has recently begun selling web downloads of music recorded at its live events. </p> <p>The all-share deal, which would have left Mr Clingen as Mean Fiddler's largest shareholder with a 15% stake, has also been scrapped. Monaco-based Mr Clingen was to become executive chairman, replacing Vince Power, who was to receive \u00a312m after selling his entire interest in the business he founded 23 years ago. </p> <p>The decision to abandon the placing and acquisition is understood to have come after rival promoter Denis Desmond, who built a 24% stake in Mean Fiddler last year, raised objections to the move. His holding was not involved in the planned placement. </p> <p>Through his Irish business MCD, Mr Desmond's interests include the V festival, the Brixton Academy and the Point in Dublin. Yesterday's decision to unwind Mean Fiddler's placing is likely to heighten speculation about Mr Desmond's holding. </p> <p>Asked earlier this year about his intentions, he said: \"I'm not saying we won't increase our stake. I'm just saying we have no plans to. The Mean Fiddler has a lot of potential, particularly in the UK market.\" MCD declined to comment. </p> <p>The aborted placing also raises questions about Mr Powers' intentions. Last week he said: \"I think I have come as far as I can now; it [Mean Fiddler] is a plc. I was never a big plc fan - I never felt comfortable trawling round the City explaining why or whatever.\" </p> <p>Asked whether Mr Power's stake remained up for sale, a spokesman for Mean Fiddler yesterday said: \"Well, it was at 55p. But not at this price, no.\" </p> <p>Shares in the AIM-listed music promotions group, which floated four years ago, yesterday closed 12.5p lower at 41p. </p> <p>Evolution Securities, which had been arranging the placing, said institutional interest in Mean Fiddler had been built on the proposed management duo of Mr Clingen and Dean James, who had spent some time presenting their case to potential investors across the City. </p> <p>In a statement to the stock exchange, Mean Fiddler said operations director Mr James, who was to become chief executive, had \"regrettably ... been removed from the board with immediate effect\". </p> <p>A spokesman explained that he had gone because he \"didn't feel he had all the support of all the shareholders\". </p> <p>Mr Power will remain as Mean Fiddler chairman and a chief executive will be sought to replace Mr James. The placing had been expected to raise \u00a35.6m. </p> <p>Mr Clingen, a former Cable &amp; Wireless sales director in the Caribbean, had hoped to focus on expanding the live music download business, establishing a website to compete with iTunes' and Napster. A number of \"well-known institutional investors\" are said to have backed Mr Clingen and Mr James, Evolution Securities said last week.</p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column on Friday October 8 2004</b> <br> The \u00a320,000 award made by the European court of human rights to a patient detained under the Mental Health Act was for costs and not, as we said, for damages. <p>An autistic man who was held informally in a psychiatric hospital without the safeguards for patients who are \"sectioned\" under the Mental Health Act, won damages yesterday for a breach of his human rights. </p> <p>In a judgment with big resource implications for the NHS, the European court of human rights ordered the UK government to pay \u00a320,000 damages to the man, named only as HL. </p> <p>The ruling could apply to tens of thousands of people with learning disabilities and dementia, who lack the ability to consent to or refuse treatment. Doctors had previously admitted them informally to hospital and treated them on the basis that they were apparently \"compliant\" and did not need to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act. </p> <p>Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, the man's solicitor, said the government would have to amend the mental capacity bill, now going through parliament, to give patients without the capacity to consent the same safeguards as those compulsorily sectioned. </p> <p>This would mean a system of formal assessments and access to review tribunals to argue for their release. </p> <p>The Strasbourg judges said the lack of any fixed rules in UK law governing the admission and detention of \"compliant\" patients who lack the capacity to consent to treatment was \"striking\". </p> <p>They ruled that the circumstances round HL's detention amounted to breaches of his rights to liberty and security, and to a review of the legality of his detention. </p> <p>HL, 55, from Surrey, is autistic and unable to speak, with a \"limited\" level of understanding, the court was told. He is frequently agitated and has a history of self-harm. </p> <p>For 30 years he was cared for in hospital until being discharged in March 1994 on a trial basis to paid carers. He lived with them successfully until July 1997, when, during a regular visit to a day-centre, he became agitated, hitting himself and banging his head against a wall. </p> <p>Day-centre staff called a doctor who sedated him. </p> <p>He was transferred as an \"informal patient\" to an intensive behavioural unit (IBU) but not formally detained under the Mental Health Act, which would have given him the right to apply to a review tribunal for release. </p> <p>When his carers took the case to the high court two months later, a judge ruled that he had not been \"detained\" in law. The appeal court overturned that decision, but the House of Lords finally ruled holding HL under common law was sufficient. </p> <p>The Strasbourg court noted \"the lack of any formalised admission procedures indicating who could propose admission, for what reasons and on the basis of what kind of medical and other assessment and conclusions\". </p> <p>Healthcare professionals had \"assumed full control of the liberty and treatment of a vulnerable incapacitated individual\", the judges added. </p> <p>\"While the court did not question the good faith of those professionals ... the very purpose of procedural safeguards was to protect individuals against any misjudgment or professional lapse.\" </p> <p>Without those safeguards, said the judges, HL was not protected against \"arbitrary deprivations of liberty\" and was not guaranteed access to procedures to challenge the legality of his detention. </p> <p>The judgment was welcomed by Mencap chief executive Jo Williams, who said: \"We hope the government will use this judgment to ensure that the mental capacity bill closes this indefensible gap in mental health law.\"</p>",

  "<p>Random drug testing of school pupils would be hugely increased as a part of a future Conservative government's crackdown on drug addiction, the shadow home secretary declared today.</p> <p>In a hardline \"war on drugs\" speech to the party faithful in Bournemouth, David Davis pledged to increase tenfold the number of drug rehabilitation places for addicted criminals - but also promised to \"support, encourage and accelerate\" David Blunkett's contentious scheme for testing schoolchildren.</p> <p>There was no detail in the speech on how the plan - which may be incompatible with the Human Rights Act - would be implemented, but Mr Davis went on to pledge that immigration would be a \"central issue\" at the next election.</p> <p>Mr Davis also made a direct connection between the IRA and the war on terrorism. He told delegates: \"We've been fighting [the war on terror] since before the phrase was invented.</p> <p>\"Twenty years ago in Brighton some dear friends died in that war.</p> <p>\"This new brand of terrorist, heartless and evil as they are, are no more representative of Islam than IRA terrorists were representative of Catholicism.\"</p> <p>He was most heavily applauded by grassroots activists for his pledge - briefed ahead of the speech - that the Tories would step up the \"war on drugs\".</p> <p>But he also cut away from his speech for a video from Nottingham shopkeeper Victor Bates, whose wife was killed by armed raiders. Since a man has been charged with that murder, the short film clip risked running foul of the law on contempt of court.</p> <p>Mr Davis made strong attacks on both the current home secretary and the Liberal Democrats. Citing the government's 37 acts of parliament, 160 initiatives and 350 new regulations, he claimed: \"This home secretary is more concerned about getting headlines than catching criminals.\"</p> <p>And claiming the Lib Dems would send joyriders on go-karting courses, he called their mantra of \"tough liberalism\" an \"oxymoron - with the emphasis on the last two syllables\".</p> <p>Mr Davis received another warm round of applause for criticising Mr Blunkett's plans for weekend prisons, saying: \"The trouble is, we don't have weekend criminals.\"</p> <p>Mr Davis vowed to keep tagging, but only \"in addition, not an alternative\" to prison.</p> <p>Citing Mr Howard's famous \"prison works\" mantra, he pledged to build more prisons, although again there was no detail on costs or numbers.</p> <p>He also promised to recruit an extra 5,000 police officers a year, but insisted they would be \"real police\" rather than the current boost in numbers of community support officers (CSOs).</p> <p>Echoing the Police Federation's criticisms, he dismissed CSOs as \"people who can't arrest anyone\".</p> <p>On immigration, which he left to the end, Mr Davis paid tribute to Britain's \"tradition of tolerance\" but insisted the Tories would bring in a fixed annual quota and overseas processing.</p> <p>\"It will be a central issue at the next election,\" he vowed, claiming that \"immigration alone could fill six new cities the size of Birmingham over the next three decades\".</p> <p>Calling Britain's current immigration levels \"too much, far too much\", he said the government's approach was \"clueless, chaotic and potentially catastrophic\".</p> <p>Mr Davis, a former leadership challenger on the right of the party, was interrupted repeatedly by applause from the gathered delegates - especially when he promised to end \"Labour's war on the motorist and the countryman\".</p> <p>Reacting to today's speech, drugs information charity DrugScope welcomed the promised expansion in residential treatment places, but attacked plans to increase random testing in schools.</p> <p>Martin Barnes, DrugScope's chief executive, said: \"To accuse the government of standing aside from the drug problem is surprising and inaccurate. Whilst we believe more should be done, we are in fact seeing record increases in funding to tackle drug misuse and provide treatment. </p> <p>\"We do not accept that random drug testing in schools is a proportionate or effective response to drug use among children and young people. Testing risks driving drug use underground, an increase in truancy and exclusions and a breakdown in trust between schools and pupils.</p> <p>Schools currently have the power to carry out drug tests, but an extensive process of consultation - with teachers, head teachers and schools drugs workers - showed strong opposition. Schools should be free to decide an appropriate response to drugs free from direct or indirect political pressure to test pupils.\"</p>",

  "As Conservatives we have a clear idea of what constitutes good government. <p>And the very first duty of government is to uphold the law and to make the citizens secure. </p> <p>Labour just can't grasp that. </p> <p>Their priorities are all wrong. </p> <p>They permit what shouldn't be legal; </p> <p>they ban what shouldn't be banned; </p> <p>and they allow hardened criminals to flourish. </p> <p>When it comes to controlling the honest citizen, they're enthusiastic for any and every means of control:</p> <p>speed cameras, ID cards, trials without juries - they love all that. </p> <p>But they won't build the prisons to keep criminals in and keep you safe.</p> <p>That's the difference between us and them. </p> <p>Conservative policies for law and order aren't about putting Big Brother in Charge. </p> <p>They're about putting the citizen in charge. </p> <p>But the citizen today is frightened, angry and restless. </p> <p>We shall act to change that, and only the Conservatives have the will or the guts to do it.</p> <p><b>Record in Government</b></p> <p>Today I want to talk about Labour's record on law and order.</p> <p>There's been lots of activity: 37 Acts of Parliament, 160 'initiatives'; and 350 new regulations. </p> <p>But where has it all led?</p> <p>Britain has a million hard drug addicts for the first time ever.</p> <p>A million violent crimes each year for the first time ever.</p> <p>And a million more unsolved crimes than when Labour took power.

and both help create the culture of violence.</p> <p>Today, parts of Britain are virtual no-go areas. </p> <p>Towns and cities - once peaceful - now overrun with gangs toting guns. </p> <p>And, in the middle, are decent, hard-working people whose lives are ruined - like someone I'm going to introduce to you now. </p> <p>Until recently, he was looking forward to seeing out his working life and then to a happy retirement with his wife. </p> <p>A year ago, all that changed.</p> <p>This video will upset us, but it should also make us angry. </p> <p>Angry for Victor Bates and the thousands like him whose lives have been ruined. </p> <p>Angry for the law-abiding majority who so often live in fear. </p> <p>And angry with this Labour Government for giving up the war on drugs, backing out of the fight against crime and showing weakness when they promised to be tough. </p> <p>[...] </p> <p>I would like to make a promise to you and to Victor. </p> <p>I cannot pledge that such horrors will never occur under a Conservative Government. </p> <p>But I can and I do promise that we will never give up on the war against crime and the war against drugs.</p> <p><b>Police performance</b></p> <p>Today thousands of our fellow countrymen are afraid - </p> <p>afraid to stay in their homes, afraid to leave them; </p> <p>afraid to summon help, afraid not to; </p> <p>afraid to barricade their doors, afraid to be trapped behind them. </p> <p>But in Conservative Britain I want the criminals to be afraid - </p> <p>afraid of being caught and afraid of being punished. </p> <p>There's a simple reason why Rudi Guiliani made New York a safer City than London.</p> <p>Why Ray Mallon has cut crime time and again in Middlesbrough.</p> <p>It's because they decided not to tolerate crime any more.</p> <p>They were locally elected officials who listened to the people and gave them what they wanted. </p> <p>Zero tolerance of crime. Zero tolerance of failure to act on crime.</p> <p>We'll give people the right to choose who will run their local police force. </p> <p>And to determine the priorities they want their police to follow. </p> <p>But zero tolerance policing demands more police. </p> <p>A lot more police. </p> <p>And I mean real police. </p> <p>This Government has responded by recruiting 25,000 people who can't arrest anyone. </p> <p>We will respond by recruiting 40,000 police officers who can.</p> <p>And we have to ensure that those police, like all our police, are used properly. </p> <p>They mustn't be diverted to tasks determined by political correctness. </p> <p>They mustn't be employed to carry out by proxy the Labour Party's war against the motorist or the countryman. </p> <p>And they mustn't be impeded by the deadweight of regulation that this Labour Government has imposed. </p> <p>Our alternative is clear: the next Conservative government will set the police free to cut crime.</p> <p>There will be no more national targets, no more ring-fenced funding, Whitehall priorities.</p> <p>Just good, traditional policing. </p> <p>Deterring crime and catching criminals. </p> <p>That's what the public wants.</p> <p><b>Prisons</b></p> <p>Catching criminals is no good if you don't punish them.</p> <p>But Britain's prisons are already full.</p> <p>The Home Office predicts a prison population of around 100,000 at the end of the decade - but are only planning spaces for 80,000. </p> <p>As a result of this failure of planning we'll now see every underhand device possible to let people out of prison early or prevent them from being sent there in the first place.</p> <p>David Blunkett's latest idea is weekend prison. </p> <p>The trouble is, of course, that we don't have weekend criminals. </p> <p>They're at it all day, all week, all the year round. </p> <p>That's why they need to be locked up - all day, all week, all the year round.</p> <p>Prison does work. </p> <p>It is a deterrent. </p> <p>Criminals fear it.</p> <p>And it takes criminals out of circulation - while they are locked up, they cannot commit crimes.</p> <p>Half of all crimes in Britain are committed by the same 100,000 persistent criminals.</p> <p>But at any one time, just 15,000 of these are actually in jail. </p> <p>Leaving 85,000 serious criminals out roaming your streets, out burgling your homes, out robbing your friends.</p> <p>But rather than build more prisons, this Government have been letting prisoners out early. Tagged.</p> <p>As Michael Howard told you yesterday, this means 3,600 unnecessary crimes; 3,600 unnecessary victims.</p> <p>Electronic tagging has its place. </p> <p>But a prison without bars is not a prison. </p> <p>Tagging should be used as an addition to prison, not as an alternative.</p> <p>Our policy is not to lock people up and throw away the key. </p> <p>It's important for them and society that they come out better not worse than they went in. </p> <p>And they can sometimes reform, if we get the framework and the programmes right.</p> <p>But one thing is clear: if prisons are overcrowded, prisoners are just shuffled around the system to make room, and they end up never finishing a retraining course. </p> <p>So they end up on the street, without skills, unable to read, often addicted to drugs, with no prospect of work. </p> <p>And they go straight back to crime. </p> <p>The Conservative programme of prison building and our drug rehabilitation programme gives us an opportunity to cut the vicious cycle of re-offending.</p> <p>Our criminal justice system is in crisis.</p> <p>We will solve this crisis.</p> <p>By scrapping Labour's early release scheme; </p> <p>By increasing the proportion of the prison budget that is spent on education and rehabilitation; </p> <p>And by starting a prison building programme that will allow judges to send prisoners down for the sentence they deserve. </p> <p>A sentence designed to fit the crime, not the number of prison cells available.</p> <p>We'll start this in the first month and complete it in the first term of a Conservative Government.</p> <p>We will make Britain more secure and bring down crime. </p> <p>It can be done.</p> <p>It must be done.</p> <p>It will be done.</p> <p><b>Immigration</b></p> <p>As Michael Howard reminded us yesterday, the Home Secretary says he sees no \"obvious limit\" to legal immigration. </p> <p>And as for the number of illegal immigrants already here: well he confesses he \"hasn't a clue\".</p> <p>Clueless, chaotic and potentially catastrophic - three words summing up this Government's immigration policy.</p> <p>Since Labour came to power, immigration has soared. </p> <p>It is running at three times its previous level - and that's not counting illegal immigrants.</p> <p>Immigration alone could fill six new cities the size of Birmingham over the next three decades. </p> <p>The Government says that it doesn't know if this level of immigration is too much or too little. </p> <p>Well let me tell them. It is too much, far too much, and we must do something about it.</p> <p>Let me make it clear, we will never diminish the contribution that immigrants make: </p> <p>we welcome and we value it. </p> <p>Britain is better for all the immigrants over the centuries who have worked hard to make this their home. </p> <p>But respect for past immigrants doesn't mean backing away from our duty now. </p> <p>But Britain is already the most densely populated major country in Europe. </p> <p>And the immigration we receive isn't evenly distributed - it goes to our most overcrowded areas. </p> <p>It puts a burden on housing, health, schools and other public services, and it does so where that burden is already heaviest to bear.</p> <p>A Conservative government will substantially cut immigration into Britain.</p> <p>Uncontrolled immigration endangers the values that we in Britain rightly treasure. </p> <p>We Conservatives understand how vital it is not to threaten what makes this country so tolerant, so decent, so respectful of other people's rights - and, yes, so welcoming of people who come here. </p> <p>Extremist political parties are hoping to batten on the fears and resentments that already exist. </p> <p>So the next Conservative Government will act. </p> <p>We will tightly control immigration because the country requires it.</p> <p>I don't blame people for wanting to come to Britain to find a better life. </p> <p>What I blame is the system that lures them - and then leaves them - here. </p> <p>The shabby trade in illegal immigration is run by criminals; and those who work illegally in Britain easily become their victims. </p> <p>For that reason too, we must act to secure the future - including the future of our settled immigrant populations - before it is too late.</p> <p>And we will act in several ways.</p> <p>We will curb illegal immigration by re-introducing embarkation controls - physically checking people in, and physically checking them out again. </p> <p>We will also push ahead with reforms to our asylum system, with a system of overseas processing.</p> <p>We will reform the system of work permits, which is currently being abused.</p> <p>Above all, we shall lay down a clear annual limit to the level of total immigration. </p> <p>And we'll see it isn't breached.</p> <p>This will reassure people about their future. </p> <p>And it will sweep away, once and for all, the web of distortion and deceit that poisons this debate.</p> <p>I make no apologies for talking about immigration. </p> <p>It is an issue of real public concern.</p> <p>It will be a central issue at the next election. </p> <p>And have no doubt: if the legitimate parties don't discuss it, the real danger is that extremists will. </p> <p>We will not give them that opportunity.</p> <p><b>Terrorism</b></p> <p>Efficient immigration controls are a crucial part of the war against terror.</p> <p>The Conservative Party will never flinch in that war. </p> <p>We've been fighting it since before the phrase was invented. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, in Brighton some dear friends died in that war. </p> <p>We shall never forget them.</p> <p>We treat terrorism seriously. </p> <p>The terrorist threat is more important than party advantage. </p> <p>And today that threat is greater than it has ever been.</p> <p>So I support much of what the Government has done to deal with terrorism. </p> <p>I shall continue to do so.</p> <p>But I will remind the Home Secretary of this - he is not just protecting our lives, he is protecting our way of life - and that includes our ancient British liberties: the presumption of innocence, the right to trial by jury, habeas corpus. </p> <p>And he should not erode these unless he has exhausted every other possibility.</p> <p>And we should remember this. </p> <p>This new brand of terrorist, heartless and evil as they are, are no more representative of Islam than IRA terrorists were representative of Catholicism. </p> <p>We are fortunate in having many good, moderate Muslim leaders in this country, who espouse and promote peace. </p> <p>I salute their courage. </p> <p>The terrorists are as much of a threat to them as they are to the rest of us.</p> <p>But those who abuse our open society, our free press, our tolerance, to foment hatred and divisions, to promote vicious doctrines and give encouragement to terrorists - against those we should deploy the full arsenal of our law and our forces.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>Try it on</p> <p>People today often bemoan what's happened to society. </p> <p>The disorder, the general lack of respect and civility. </p> <p>What government can do about it is limited. </p> <p>Yet government should help not hinder. </p> <p>It can introduce good laws and ensure they're enforced by effective policing. </p> <p>It can provide the resources to keep dangerous men locked up, not preying on our neighbourhoods. </p> <p>It can control the country's borders, and it can keep out or throw out those who wish our nation ill. </p> <p>On all these things, this Labour Government is failing - and its failure is dragging our whole society down.</p> <p>In Britain today, there's a silent struggle. </p> <p>It's between the decent, respectable, law abiding citizen, who wants to look after his own, and pay his dues, and get on with his life. </p> <p>And on the other side there's a noisy minority that cares nothing for anyone - people who respect only force. </p> <p>How do you think that predatory minority feels now? </p> <p>What signals do you think they get from our criminal justice system today? </p> <p>I'll tell you the message that goes out: Fancy committing a crime? </p> <p>Go on, try it. Under Labour you're not likely to get caught. </p> <p>Want to move to Britain but can't be bothered to go through the proper channels? </p> <p>Go on, try it. Come and claim asylum that you don't deserve. Under Labour there's only a one in five chance of being sent home.</p> <p>Fancy selling alcohol to minors, mugging an old lady, nicking something from the shops, dealing drugs, or spray-painting your name all over the place? </p> <p>Well, go ahead - try it. Under Labour out of 100 crimes committed, only 3 result in a conviction. </p> <p>In Tony Blair's Britain, more and more people see the decent majority as another soft touch. </p> <p>They're bending the rules; they're trying it on; they're flouting the law. </p> <p>That's the reality of Britain under Labour - and it's time to bring it to an end. </p> <p>It's time to regain control, end political correctness, cut red tape, enforce the law and send a clear and consistent message - we're not going to be pushed around any more. </p> <p>We need a change of culture. A return to the values of decency, discipline and respect. </p> <p>For that we need a change of Government. </p> <p>One that doesn't just talk tough, but one that is tough. </p> <p>A Conservative Government.</p>",
  "<p>\"A new California law aimed at curbing spyware, software applications that surreptitiously collect the keystrokes, passwords, and credit-card numbers of Internet users, will go into effect Jan. 1,\" reports <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=49400901\" title=\"InformationWeek > Spyware Legislation > Spyware Legislation To Take Effect Jan. 1 > October 5, 2004\">InformationWeek</a>.</p> <p>\"The law, dubbed the Consumer Protection Against Spyware Act, was signed last week by Calif.

The law also requires software companies and Web sites to inform users if their software or sites will install spyware and disclose what the spyware will do and what information it will collect.

  "<p>The BBC has issued a veiled warning to Ofcom, saying the government's media watchdog is encroaching on areas that should be regulated by the corporation's board of governors.</p> <p>In its response to the regulator's draft broadcasting code, which aims to draw together the guidelines on a range of broadcasting issues from the protection of children to bias and sponsorship, the corporation accused Ofcom of straying beyond its remit. </p> <p>The BBC took issue with a clause in the new code that states \"factual programmes must respect the truth\". The broadcaster argued strongly in its response that the regulator had no power to impose guidelines covering the accuracy or impartiality of its programmes. </p> <p>\"Both before and during the passage of the Communications Act through parliament, the government made it very clear its policy was that the BBC should not be subject to any of Ofcom's codes relating to accuracy or impartiality,\" it argued. </p> <p>The corporation pointed to a policy document attached to the bill as it made its way through parliament, which stated that \"requirements relating to accuracy and impartiality... will continue to be regulated solely by the BBC governors\". </p> <p>It said the proposed code \"cuts across the regulatory function of the BBC governors\", adding it was an \"important principle\" that BBC production staff should not have to face a complaint being referred to both the governors and Ofcom. </p> <p>Another passage of the proposed code, which rules that \"descriptions of religious views and beliefs must be presented with due accuracy and fairness\", also cuts across the role of the governors, according to the BBC. </p> <p>The issue is a sensitive one. Under the provisions of the Communications Act, passed last year, Ofcom was given the power to fine the BBC if it breached the rules covering taste and decency but not those relating to accuracy and impartiality.</p> <p>But as part of the fallout from the Hutton report and the lobbying process leading up to the renewal of the BBC's charter in 2006, there is a growing campaign for BBC regulation to be transferred to Ofcom or another new regulator. </p> <p>Critics argue that, despite moves by the new BBC chairman, Michael Grade, to distance the board of governors from the BBC management, it is impossible for them to be both \"regulators and flag wavers\" for the corporation. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats and the former BBC director general, Greg Dyke, who was ousted by the governors following Lord Hutton's damning verdict on the Iraq dossier row, both support the creation of a public service broadcasting regulator to replace the board of governors. </p> <p>Relations between Ofcom and the BBC have already cooled in the past week after the regulator proposed the creation of a \"public service publisher\" to compete with the BBC. </p> <p>The recommendation would put aside \u00a3300m of public money to fund a new organisation, which would produce three hours a day of public service programming to keep the BBC in check.</p> <p>Ofcom believes it is vital to have competition in public service broadcasting to prevent the BBC slipping into a commercial mindset and dumbing down its TV and radio programmes.</p> <p>Elsewhere in its response, the BBC rejected proposals that would require radio stations to broadcast verbal warnings about material that is unsuitable for children and young people. </p> <p>It argued the proposals would be unworkable and said research showed few people are offended by radio broadcasts. </p> <p>\"Broadcasters know their likely audiences and judge when it is appropriate to schedule material that is not suitable for children or radio,\" the BBC said. </p> <p>In a statement today, a BBC spokesman said: \"The governors enjoy a productive relationship with Ofcom and share Ofcom's objectives for the new code and the advance it represents on the legacy codes. </p> <p>\"The BBC has submitted a detailed and considered response to the draft code born out of substantial work within the corporation.

  "<p>It is a tale of petty corruption, bullying and financial mismanagement, of arrogance in power and hostility to criticism, running a council like a fiefdom and removing enemies at huge cost to local taxpayers. Recent events at Lincolnshire county council are a reminder that Labour councils do not hold a monopoly on municipal sleaze. </p> <p>The story reads like a script for a gritty TV drama: a jailed former leader of the Tory-run council who refuses to resign his seat and is now out on early release and subject to a 12-hour curfew with an electronic tag; a string of officials forced out of office; and a government financial watchdog about to launch a special investigation. </p> <p>For good measure, add the comments of the council's departing chief executive, made earlier this year in evidence against the former council leader, Jim Speechley, who was on trial for trying to change the route of a by-pass to increase the value of land he owned. \"I've had four years of dealing with someone who is the most deceitful and dishonest person I've ever worked with,\" said David Bowles. </p> <p>This drama, in which fact is stranger than fiction, is still unfolding. Leaving his office for the last time at the weekend, to the applause of scores of staff, union leaders and other well-wishers, Bowles should have been reflecting on a successful spell running one of England's largest counties. But as the latest casualty in the long-running battle between the Conservative leadership of Lincolnshire and a string of senior officers, which has cost council taxpayers dearly in sky-high severance payments, he was in no mood for pleasantries. </p> <p>\"If they think by getting rid of me they have solved their problems, they have got it wrong,\" Bowles snapped in his office, while local TV crews buzzed around, in the knowledge that the Audit Commission is about to launch a corporate governance inspection (CGI) into Lincolnshire - partly at his instigation. The CGI has forced the ruling Tory group on to the defensive, with promises to examine its culture and relationships with officers. The Conservative party nationally appears to be silent on the activities of Speechley and his supporters. Lincolnshire could yet prove to be a major embarrassment to the party. </p> <p>Bowles says his former council is run \"like a combination of a fiefdom and a country club - not my words, but those of others who've investigated procedures here\". He claims that \"certain core members\" of the ruling Tory group are simply not willing to face the scandal engulfing the authority. \"I've had the temerity to say 'no', and for some people that's been a great embarrassment,\" he says. </p> <p>As a steady stream of visitors queued up for a final handshake, Bowles made clear that a \u00a3400,000 compensation package was little reward for the nightmare of four years in county hall - culminating in him blowing the whistle on misconduct at the heart of his authority, and saying \"no\". The result was an 18-month jail sentence for Speechley, with whom he had repeatedly clashed. </p> <p>Seven months ago, Speechley was convicted of misconduct in public office. His crime was trying to change the route of the A1073 Spalding to Eye bypass to increase the value of a parcel of land he owned near his modest detached home in Crowland, a small market town on the Lincolnshire flatlands nine miles north of Peterborough. Remarkably, the Tory council - whose current leader, Ian Croft, was a close ally - has failed to use discretionary powers at its disposal to disbar Speechley, a councillor for 38 years. He turns up, electronically tagged, at meetings, resolutely refusing to discuss his position. </p> <p>On his front doorstep, Speechley gave every impression to Society Guardian that he is determined to cling on to his seat, at least until the next four-year cycle of local elections in May. \"I am making no comment until my appeal,\" he adds politely. \"You can hear my story after that.\" His wife says she's shocked by the sentence and has resigned as a magistrate, \"although I didn't have to\". </p> <p>The story of Lincolnshire's woes goes back to the return of the Tories in 1997, after a four-year spell in which the county was run by a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition. Open University lecturer Robert Parker, the opposition Labour leader who also led the old Lab-Lib administration, claims the new rulers began a \"scorched earth policy\" - first sacking the chief executive appointed by the coalition, Jill Barrow, then removing the director of education. Both were given hefty severance payments. \"I wrote to our auditors saying I was unhappy about this,\" Parker recalls. The auditors found the payments were unlawful. </p> <p>Bowles arrived in January 1999 from the outsourcing arm of a big consultancy. Although a municipal accountant, with senior positions at the old Berkshire county council and other authorities behind him, his business background apparently appealed to Speechley and his colleagues. But on Bowles' admission, relationships soon became frayed. He recalls the story of a former council director being threatened with the sack because he questioned a decision to tilt the roads programme in favour of the south of the county. </p> <p>\"People survived by what the leader wanted,\" Bowles maintains. \"It got very personal, vindictive, spiteful. The leader [Speechley] once said to me: 'Officers do not give the members much respect.' I replied: 'I am sorry, but respect has to be earned.'\" </p> <p>Stress led to Bowles being signed off work for three months earlier this year - he says he is still on medication - and the Tory leadership informally made it clear he would not be welcomed back. But by then, the ruling group itself was badly fractured. In May this year, Bernard Theobold, deputy to leader Ian Croft for 18 months, challenged for the leadership but was defeated by a margin of 21-17. \"I thought I could do a better job, that some matters had to be resolved and some fresh blood would be a good thing,\" said Theobold, a theatrical and music agent who also leads the small West Lindsey district council. </p> <p>Theobold is clearly uneasy that Speechley is still a member of the council, turning up \"tagged\" at meetings and undermining the council's already badly tarnished image. \"We can argue whether people who have served a prison sentence should be a councillor,\" he says. \"But, in his shoes, I would have resigned.\" </p> <p>It is here that, even by the complexities of Lincolnshire politics, events have taken a bizarre twist. Theobold admires Bowles as a first-rate public servant who, he says, has always acted in the best traditions of local government - so much so that the former chief executive is now moving to nearby West Lindsey council (where Theobold is leader) to become interim chief executive. \"He brings a lot to the table,\" Theobold insists. \"We had a vacancy, he was available, he applied, and he took it.\" </p> <p>But the ruling (10-strong) executive running Lincolnshire was not impressed. In what some dissident county Tories (a group of councillors who do not support Croft) have labelled \"victimisation\", Theobold was removed from the county council appointments committee, which will pick the next chief executive, days after Bowles got his job at West Lindsey. The appointments committee will have a difficult task; the Association of Local Authority Chief Executives, which has been supporting Bowles, has urged its members not to apply for the vacant post. </p> <p>In truth, the county will be in limbo until the Audit Commission has completed its report, probably by the end of the year. If contrition is not in its nature, it can clearly now see the writing on the wall. Deputy council leader, Denis Hoyes, chooses his words carefully, because he says 20 Tory councillors have received letters from lawyers acting for Bowles warning them not to discuss the case of Speechley and the departure of the chief executive. \"We welcome the Audit Commission and have nothing to fear from them,\" maintained Hoyes. \"Our services are good [Lincolnshire had a \"fair\" rating in the Audit Commission's last corporate assessment] and we have to prove we can learn in our culture, the way we present ourselves, and the way we work with officers.\" </p> <p>Critics say warm words will do little to bring about change: both Tory dissidents and opposition members say the county desperately needs a new leadership capable of restoring the reputation of a council whose ruling executive has an average age of over 70. So far, it does not appear to have learned from earlier criticisms. Two years ago, in another special report triggered after complaints from the Labour opposition, the accountants KPMG identified tens of thousands of pounds of illegal payments and accused Speechley of abusing his power. Bowles himself says he has calculated that the sacking of senior staff, such as himself, has cost the council more than \u00a32m. </p> <p>In Speechley's electoral division, the disgraced former leader can still count on some support - although perhaps not as strong as some loyalists maintain. \"He's done a lot for Crowland,\" says a middle-aged woman. \"His father ran the butcher's shop. It's disgusting that sentence they gave him. You'd think he was a criminal.\" </p> <p>Nearby, a war veteran, aged 84, has some sympathy. \"He did quite a lot for the town, and his family are very bitter that he went to prison, but a lot of people think he was trying to make a bit on the side.\" That is certainly the view of Arthur Howell, who has lived in Crowland all his 42 years. \"He was convicted, it was a fair trial, and that's that,\" he said. \"He should resign.\" </p> <p>Whether that will bring the drama to an end is another matter. This week, at the Tory conference in Bournemouth, some are hoping that senior party figures will finally break their silence on Lincolnshire - and force long-overdue changes in the county. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lincolnshire county council is at <a href=\"http://www.lincolnshire.gov.uk\">www.lincolnshire.gov.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>In her foreword to The Alfred Hitchcock Story (by Ken Mogg, Titan Books) Janet Leigh recalled shooting the infamous shower scene. </p> <p>I had met Mr and Mrs Hitchcock socially a few years before the making of Psycho. We always hit it off, mainly due, I suppose, to our wild sense of humour and mutual passion for movies. In the late summer of 1959 a messenger delivered an envelope containing a book and a note that read in essence, \"Dear Janet, please consider taking the part of Mary Crane... Anthony Perkins is set to play Norman Bates.\" And it concluded with his customary signature profile. </p> <p>That was the beginning of my professional relationship with \"the man\". I went home for tea and to be introduced to his modus operandi. It was awesome. In his mind, and sketched on the pages of his script, the film was already shot. He showed me the model sets and moved the miniature camera through the tiny furniture toward the wee dolls, exactly the way he intended to do it in \"reel\" life. He was meticulously thorough. </p> <p>I was told I had carte blanche to play Marion (the name was changed from the novel) as I envisioned her, except I had to move when his camera dictated. I am aware many actors felt this approach was a threat to their freedom of expression. Perhaps I would have also felt that, under a different leader. But how could anyone question his method when his results were so spectacular? </p> <p>Fortunately, we moulded perfectly. It was one of the most relaxed and pleasurable atmospheres in which I've worked. No tension, no tantrums, a great deal of interesting conversation, much laughter and many practical jokes. But believe me, when the cinematographer was ready, we were all business, and completely focused on the scene. The shower sequence took seven shooting days and tallied over 70 set-ups, and he knew precisely what portion of a second he would use of each angle. </p> <p>He was such a mischievous imp. And oh so smart! Mr \"H\" deliberately weaved a web of mystery and speculation about this film. Always the quintessential salesman, he had rumours flying by the first week of shooting. The set was closed, which always aroused interest. When I was actually in the shower, wearing moleskin over the necessary parts and a bathing suit where I was out of camera, I noticed each crew member had several new \"assistants\". </p> <p>When I had finished my three weeks, he hired a professional artist's model to be on the set nude, obviously fuelling the buzz he had created. I am certain he followed the same pattern of perfection in every one of his endeavours.</p>",
  "Addicts who turn to crime to feed their habit will face a choice of jail or rehabilitation under a 10-fold expansion of drug treatment programmes, the Conservatives will announce today. <p>David Davis, the shadow home secretary, will unveil a \"timetable for action\" at the Tories' key law and order debate in Bournemouth today.</p> <p>He is to pledge that the country \"hasn't even begun\" fighting the \"war on drugs\" yet. More controversially, he will announce a massive expansion of random drug testing for school pupils.</p> <p>Crime and law and order are traditionally perceived as Tory trump cards in election campaigning, although David Blunkett's hardline stance as home secretary has seen the divide between the parties narrow.</p> <p>Many delegates on the fringe this week have expressed doubts about the government's \u00a33bn scheme to introduce ID cards, so any word on that in Mr Davis's speech will be eagerly awaited.</p> <p>Since shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin's spending plans include no extra money for the Home Office, Mr Davis is expected to propose paying for an extra 5,000 police officers a year by diverting savings planned for the immigration and nationality departments.</p> <p>Yesterday Michael Howard pledged a \"war on crime\" based on the zero-tolerance policies of former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Middlesbrough \"Robocop\" Ray Mallon. </p> <p>Today, Mr Davis is due to say: \"Some people say that we've lost the war on drugs. I say we haven't begun to fight it. Fighting it will be my top priority.\" </p> <p>Mr Davis will insist that offering addicts the choice of undergoing rehabilitation to escape prison was \"no soft option\". </p> <p>\"It will mean court supervision, and failure will mean prison. This has worked in America and with the right powers it can work here.</p> <p>\"The public is protected. The addict is encouraged to go straight - and stay straight. </p> <p>\"If nothing is done, we will face a drugs epidemic, with terrible effects on our whole society.\" </p> <p>A recent survey suggested that as many as 100,000 children aged 13 to 15 in the UK had used cocaine, Mr Davis will say, adding: \"That's why we will support, encourage and accelerate the implementation of random drug-testing of pupils.\"</p> <p>He will add: \"Children need to know that it is not cool to use drugs - it's stupid, it's dangerous, it's illegal.</p> <p>\"And parents should know that the law will be enforced. </p> <p>\"I make no apology for taking a hard line on drugs. They destroy lives, destroy society and render all our efforts to reduce crime worthless.\" </p> <p>Mr Davis will also confirm plans to scrap Labour's early release scheme for prisoners and slim down form-filling by police officers. </p> <p>Mr Davis told BBC1's Breakfast programme: \"The policing budget in the first four years primarily comes from the savings we are going to make on the immigration and nationality department. </p> <p>\"What has happened since this government has been in power is that the cost of that department has gone from \u00a3280m in the first year up to \u00a31,820m - six times up. We are not going to get it right back to \u00a3280m, but we will get it back roughly to half over a couple of years. </p> <p>\"The prison-building will come as a result of the major savings programme that Oliver has been talking about across Whitehall. The drugs funding will come in the health budget.\" </p> <p>Mr Davis acknowledged that it would take time to create extra prison places. But he said that the additional pressure on space created by his immediate abolition of the early release scheme would be eased by the diversion of young drug offenders from prison to rehabilitation programmes.</p> <p>He also pledged a future Tory government would end the \"target culture\" and free up \"bottlenecks\" in the criminal justice system. </p> <p>He denied this contradicted Mr Howard's \"timetable for action\", stressing that Tories would free police from the \"paperwork mountain\". </p> <p>\"The problem that we have at the moment is the whole system is under pressure because you have got bottlenecks all along it, from the police right through to the prisons,\" he told Today. </p> <p>Mr Davis also attacked the early release scheme, stressing that electronic tagging must be used in conjunction with prison sentences. </p> <p>\"Roughly half the crime in the country is carried out by about 100,000 persistent criminals. At any point in time only 15,000 of them are in jail, which means you've got 85,000 on the streets robbing you, robbing me, carrying on putting the crime rate up. </p> <p>\"That's why you need more prison cells,\" he said.</p>",
  "Paris fashion week, which began on Monday but, as usual, waited until yesterday to wheel out its big names, already looks set to prove that the French capital really is the home of the best fashion industry. <p>Tradition holds that each of the fashion weeks is differentiated by a single adjective: New York is the commercial one, London is the arty one, Milan is the trendsetter and Paris is the fashionable one. </p> <p>It's easy to see how these stereotypes arose: Milan and New York are both interested in the bottom line, merely approaching it in a different way, and London is the centre for some of the best art and fashion schools in the world. Although no one would accuse the French fashion world of having a blas\u00e9 attitude towards business and earnings (this is, after all, the home of LVMH, one of the world's biggest fashion conglomerates), the country has above all a tradition of simple love and respect for design and the history of style. </p> <p>How this benefits designers and consumers was apparent in the first day of big shows, as Balenciaga, Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood and Junya Watanabe all showed respect for the past tempered with their respective modern twists. </p> <p>After three weeks of shows which have consisted primarily of designers either trying to redesign trousers - and coming up with tapered shorts - or trotting out endless wispy dresses, this originality was welcome. They show how fashion can be interesting but also, most importantly, wearable. </p> <p><b>Vivienne Westwood</b> has long grappled with two pasts: the 18th century, and her own. She has yet to escape from the general consensus that her career triumphs have been and gone, in a waft of pirate and punk outfits. With regard to the former, the classical styles of Fragonard and Boucher (this season's muse) have long influenced this very unclassical woman. In yesterday's show her familiar billowing blouson tops were combined with heavily tailored pirate jackets and platform shoes padded with Coca-Cola and Holsten Pils cans. The fabulous taffeta dresses, all starched and corsetted, made even sylphic models look curvaceous. </p> <p><b>Junya Watanabe</b> has also long looked to the past and, unlike too many others, modernises it beautifully. For next spring/summer, he has made a selection of long pleated black skirts and dresses, and variously deconstructed white shirts, fringed with copper. While this was all very simple and lovely, Watanabe fans will find the stiff shapes and bulky shift dresses distinctly familiar - a surprise from a designer usually so original. </p> <p>No one would ever accuse <b>John Galliano at Dior</b> of being constrained by the past. In yesterday's relatively pared down show there were several outfits of pencil skirts, jackets and pillbox hats, royal family-style - but it's unlikely Princess Margaret ever wore a skirt that was transparent, a jacket with a cartoon logo on the back and black kohl circles around her eyes. </p> <p>As for the rest of the collection, models stomped out in a selection of tweeds with pale denim detailing and multi-coloured knitted dresses heavily logoed and fringed with chiffon or denim. Admittedly, it was all very Paris, albeit more Paris Hilton than Paris, France. But as usual, the real emphasis is on the accessories and this time around they were comparatively constrained: simple red leather handbags with Marc Jacobs-style two front pockets and glitter-studded handbags. The key-shaped hairpins and giant coloured beads are probably being knocked out by high street retailers already. </p> <p>But it's really <b>Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re at Balenciaga</b> who shows how to do this \"modernised past\" idea best. For the past few seasons, he has hit upon a clever style: designing clothes that are in the shape of the designs he finds in Balenciaga's venerable archives, but then tweaking them in a decidedly more modern (or \"conceptual\", as they are usually described) style. The end result is almost always wearable. </p> <p>For spring/summer, he has taken a classic, Stepford Wives-style summer dress with A-line skirt - and updated it by swooping the fabric underneath the skirt, in the manner of a pouffe skirt, but far more flattering than that 80s monstrosity. </p> <p>There were also long, narrow jackets, heavy with sequins (unlike too many designers this season, Ghesqui\u00e8re has realised that this 30s-style jacket is far more elegant than a little boxy version which rests ever so emphatically right on a woman's hips), and pencil skirts studded with zippers which, opened, revealed layers of soft blue tulle beneath. </p> <p>Ghesqui\u00e8re shows how a potentially gimmicky idea can lead to beautiful and wearable clothes, and Paris restores one's faith that fashion needn't be either dull or deluded.</p> <p><b>Trend watch: cummerbunds</b> </p> <p>Forget about the low and slouchy big leather belts - very Sienna Miller last season. The next belt style you should be gearing up is the cummerbund. Yes, you may feel like an extra in a Gilbert &amp; Sullivan musical at first, but one must always suffer for fashion </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> At Yohji Yamamoto white pleated cummerbunds were so thick they nearly covered the short black skirts beneath </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Alessandro dell'Acqua also went down the cummerbund route to better control his wafty, floaty dresses </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Marc Jacobs and his commercial Marc line, featured these semi-belts</p>",
  "<p>Desmond Tutu is taking his off-Broadway debut in his stride. \"I'm just waiting for my Tony nominations now,\" he says from his New York hotel. Tutu, 72, is relaxing for a few minutes after two well-received performances in Guant\u00e1namo: Honour Bound to Defend Freedom. Then he is on his way to Rochester, Chicago, Philadelphia and back home. </p> <p>Guant\u00e1namo, written by Gillian Slovo and former Guardian journalist Victoria Brittain, is a documentary-drama based on the transcripts of interviews with those detained at the American military base in Cuba. Tutu was asked by Slovo if he would perform the role of Lord Justice Steyn, a law lord who delivers a damning judgment on the American abuse of human rights at Guant\u00e1namo. So Tutu brought forward his trip to America to accommodate his performances at the Culture Project in Greenwich Village. </p> <p>Tutu serves on the Guant\u00e1namo Human Rights Commission, which was set up with the aim of ending all forms of internment without trial. He describes the play as \"stark\" and \"devastating\" and says it reminded him of his time heading up South Africa's post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission. </p> <p>Tutu talks about the people held without charge and without trial, bent over double with bags over their heads, he talks about the sexual abuse and rape allegations and asks, how can a country call itself a democracy if it only acts democratically when it chooses to do so? </p> <p>\"It is inhumane and it is a blot on the west, which claims such high standards of justice and fair play. The justification that the administration has given here is that we are at war. Now if you're at war, those that you capture and the enemy must be prisoners of war. But these are not prisoners of war, they are a new category - enemy combatants, meaning they don't fall under the auspices of any conventions which seek to protect the rights of prisoners of war.\" </p> <p>The fact that this is not a regular war, he says, does not mean the west can lower its standards of justice. \"For me, the shattering thing is discovering how there is a sense of deja vu because this was exactly the kind of argument that the South African apartheid government used to make. We asked, why do you detain people without trial? Why do you ban people? Why do you put people under house arrest without the benefit of due process? And they would say: security of the state. </p> <p>\"You see, they have decided ahead of time that these are terrorists. The whole point of democracy is the recognition that there are rights which you cannot cancel out even when someone is a prisoner. The treatment meted out to these people, is torture. And if they had to appear before our Truth and Reconciliation, Commission we'd have said that the administration is guilty of gross violation of human rights.\" </p> <p>Guant\u00e1namo: Honour Bound to Defend Freedom premiered at the Tricycle theatre in London in May and transferred to the West End. It opened off-Broadway in August to a standing ovation. </p> <p>How did Tutu fit in with the rest of the cast? Had he done any acting as a child. \"No.\" He pauses. \"I suppose when you are a public speaker, there is a bit of acting, isn't there?\" </p> <p>Anyone who has seen Tutu talk in public will realise what a natural performer he is - his hands and eyes flying all over the place, his voice impassioned and resonant, a tiny ball of love. Three years ago, I saw him dancing at the Royal Festival Hall. There were dozens of entertainers on stage, yet you couldn't help but focus on Tutu, pink cassock bobbing up and down, dancing like a muppet. </p> <p>One of the things that has most shocked him about Guant\u00e1namo is the apathy and acceptance of much of the American public. \"It is frightening. Americans are almost shrugging their shoulders. Some seem to have bought into the argument that in order to defend yourselves, you have to use methods such as these, but that is why you have conventions. In times of war, there are rules of war. You can't say no holds barred because then there is no civilisation - it is just a chaos, everybody for themselves. </p> <p>\"It is a deep shame, and the fact that there is hardly any outcry, any sense of outrage at all, despite the evidence of what does, in fact, take place in secret ... \" He trails off. \"Oh dear, isn't it just awful?\" </p> <p>Did he ever think, back in the apartheid days of South Africa, that he'd be accusing the US of such violations of human rights? \"No. I'm deeply saddened,\" he says quietly. </p> <p>He suddenly lifts his voice and spirits. \"It is important that one says there are those who are appalled - the people, for instance, who come to see the play - and it is important to say, when you talk about the war in Iraq, there are thousands who did come out last February to demonstrate that they were against the war. So we must not tar them all with the same brush. There are those who are appalled by so many features of the policies of this US administration, and are trying to make their voice heard. But it is not easy.\" </p> <p>How did he go down in the role of Lord Steyn? The archbishop launches into that great, irrepressible hyena laugh. \"Well, I myself had considerable butterflies in the pit of my tummy, but there's hardly any acting, really. The actors just come in and sit down and speak. And people were very nice. </p> <p>\"When I walked on stage on Saturday, they thought they should give me a standing ovation. And at the end they didn't throw any tomatoes. They thought: that poor guy, let's give him another standing ovation. They are nice to old, decrepit men.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tina is 33 and works for a drug action team (DAT), earning \u00a328,000 as its coordinator advising on a strategic plan and commissioning services for young people aged five to 19. After four years in the job, she wonders if she should stay where she is or move on.</p> <p><strong>1</strong> If Tina decides to stay put, one option is to become the DAT's senior coordinator, earning \u00a337,000. It is a senior management position with responsibility for a multiagency team. She would be involved in making key strategic and development decisions. Her ability to handle a budget and her commissioning experience are crucial. </p> <p> <strong>2</strong> Moving to the prison service is an option for Tina. Employed by a primary care trust (PCT) as a manager of a safety custody programme, earning \u00a333,000, she would work with a multiagency team to identify prisoners who are at risk from harm within the first few weeks of their sentence. She is a strong candidate because of her DAT and drugs misuse experience and of work with other organisations.</p> <p> <strong>3</strong> Tina might want to develop a career as a commissioning manager within a PCT. She would be expected to work with the voluntary and statutory sectors as well as with service users, so her experience in the DAT is useful. She is in a strong position because she is used to commissioning and holding a budget and working with trusts. It is a well-paid post offering up to \u00a350,000 with a large PCT.</p> <p> <strong>4</strong> Working as a team manager for a mental health and substance misuse team in a youth offending team (YOT) is another possibility for Tina. Her background in drugs misuse services, her commissioning skills and ability to think strategically are assets. She would be expected to get to grips with all YOT services, so the job would present new challenges and variety. She could follow a management career path and would be funded to study for a postgraduate certificate in public service management. The salary is around \u00a329,000. </p> <p> <strong>5</strong> Tina has the professional social worker qualification and could return to work for a local authority, where she started her career, as a team manager responsible for social workers engaged with young people or adults with drugs misuse problems. She would earn \u00a336,000. Alternatively, she might become a policy development officer in the children and families division of a council, advising on its children at risk policy. Again, the salary can be anything up to \u00a336,000.</p>",
  "The publication tonight of the Iraq Survey Group's long-awaited report is today expected to dominate the Conservative party's conference debate on foreign policy. <p>Nicholas Soames, the shadow defence secretary, said that its likely conclusion - that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction - would be difficult for Tony Blair to explain.</p> <p>\"It does matter that the prime minister, quite clearly, was less than frank is the politest way of possibly putting it,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p> <p>The shadow defence secretary's comments follow Tory leader Michael Howard's claim yesterday in his conference address, that Mr Blair had not told the truth about the Iraq war.</p> <p>Mr Soames and the shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, are also likely to seize on Clare Short's comparison of the insurgents in Iraq to the French resistance during the second world war.</p> <p>Ms Short said: \"The free French fought against German occupation with violence, the Palestinian people are entitled to resist occupation, I mean, it's in international law [and] the Iraqi people are entitled [to resist occupation].\"</p> <p>The former Labour international development secretary, who resigned over the war in Iraq, also told the Dubai-based newspaper Gulf News that the IRA had \"never targeted civilians\".</p> <p> \"My father came from Northern Ireland... and I understand why people think 'I can't get justice in any other [non-violent] way'. </p> <p>\"I think it's always wrong to target civilians... because, even when you understood the IRA, they never targeted civilians.\"</p> <p>Mr Soames meanwhile will also have to see off claims that the Tories are set to undermine Britain's defences by cutting \u00a32.7bn from the defence budget.</p> <p>He told the BBC that \u00a31.1bn of a planned \u00a32.7bn expenditure on defence would come from internal savings and \u00a31.6bn from savings in other departments. </p> <p>\"They add up, they are validated, auditable figures and they will come from disposing of large areas of business where the services and Ministry of Defence should not be involved.\"</p>",
  "<p>News Corp mogul Rupert Murdoch has publicly attacked former BSkyB chief executive Tony Ball for the first time, hinting at the strategy row that led to his departure from the pay-TV giant a year ago. </p> <p>Speaking at a Goldman Sachs investors conference in New York, Mr Murdoch criticised the former management team of Mr Ball and finance director Martin Stewart for ditching a strategy based on growth in favour of \"pushing for profit\". </p> <p>At the time of Mr Ball's departure it was widely believed that Mr Murdoch had clashed with the BSkyB chief over the key question of how much growth was left in its potential subscriber base. </p> <p>Mr Ball believed BSkyB's pay-TV universe had reached a ceiling and advocated cutting back on marketing spend, pushing up prices and investigating other opportunities such as launching a free to air channel. </p> <p>Conversely, Mr Murdoch argued strongly in favour of investing more money in the core pay-TV business for long-term growth. </p> <p>\"They turned down promotional efforts and turned up the price too much,\" said Mr Murdoch, alluding to the disagreement for the first time in public. </p> <p>The row led to the departure of Mr Ball and his controversial replacement by Rupert's 31-year-old son James Murdoch. Mr Stewart, who also applied for the top job, stepped down earlier this year to be replaced by the former Dixons finance chief, Jeremy Darroch. </p> <p><strong>BSkyB under pressure from Freeview</strong></p> <p>In his year in charge of the company, Mr Murdoch has already earmarked \u00a3450m for investment in marketing, programming spend and the overhaul of the company's customer relations systems and offices. The move did not go down well with investors, wiping a fifth off the value of the company's share price. </p> <p>At present, Sky has about 7.4 million customers but growth has slowed recently because of the popularity of Freeview and a saturation of Sky's traditional customer base of sports fans and movie enthusiasts. </p> <p>Acknowledging that subscriber growth had levelled off, Mr Murdoch set a new target of 10 million subscribers by the end of the decade and insisted the UK would follow the US in having 80% penetration of pay-TV subscribers within 15 years. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch supported his son's view that the growth of Freeview, the BBC-backed service that offers 30 digital channels for a one-off payment of around \u00a350, offered little threat to the growth of pay-TV.</p> <p>\"We have all the channels offered by Freeview plus another 200 with sport and long-term movie contracts,\" he said, dismissing fears of a continued slowdown in subscriber growth ahead of the company's results on November 12. </p> <p>\"I cannot speak in front of the quarterly figures but [BSkyB] should assure everybody that there is an appropriate increase,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch also used last year's battle with investors over the BSkyB succession as evidence of how News Corp was prepared to face down dissident shareholders to achieve its aims. </p> <p>\"In London we had a pretty contentious board meeting because [investors] said there were not enough independent directors; there was suspicion over the appointment of new directors and accusations of nepotism on the appointment of the new chief executive,\" said Mr Murdoch, referring to last year's stormy BSkyB annual general meeting. </p> <p><strong>'If you don't like it, sell your shares'</strong></p> <p>\"We had shareholders who - no matter what you said - they shouted at you. I said 'if you don't like it, sell your shares',\" he said. </p> <p>Since the change of management, BSkyB has altered the balance of its board so that independent non-executive directors now hold sway. It has also scrapped guaranteed annual bonuses for its executives and improved its corporate governance credentials. </p> <p>But while on nothing like the same scale as last year's revolt, the company faces tough questions from some investors at this year's AGM over a plan to allow the company to buy back up to 5% of its shares, a move that could raise News Corp's stake to 37%. </p> <p>Some investors claim they would rather have the money in the form of a special dividend and are concerned the move would allow News Corp to take creeping control of the company without having to launch a full takeover bid. </p> <p><strong>News Corp faces shareholder dissent</strong></p> <p>News Corp, which owns a string of media interests across the globe including the Fox television network, newspapers including the New York Post, the Sun and the Times, and pay-TV operations including DirecTV, Sky Italia and BSkyB, is also facing shareholder dissent at its own AGM in Australia later this month. </p> <p>Some investors remain unhappy over plans to shift the company's listing to the US, despite News Corp's decision to last night offer an olive branch by saying it was considering moves to allay concerns by enhancing shareholder rights, improving corporate governance and offering greater protection in the event of takeovers. </p> <p>At the conference, Mr Murdoch also said News Corp could take full control of its US arm, Fox Entertainment, following the re-listing by buying back the 18% of the company that is publicly traded. \"We are not in a hurry to do it but we would certainly look at it,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Murdoch also admitted that a full buyout of BSkyB would be tempting but that it would be too expensive at current exchange rates. </p> <p>He also confirmed plans to launch new cable networks in the US, including an entertainment channel and a financial news service, were under way. </p> <p>\"That's a no brainer. We're getting on with that,\" he said, adding that he \"would like very much\" to launch a sports network to rival Disney-owned ESPN but that it would be \"pointless without the an NFL franchise\". </p> <p>Talks over rights to the next round of rights to the national American football league are at an early stage. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: US election race hots up; politics, Afghan-style; Wales disappears. </p> <p><b>HOWARD MAKES A SPLASH</b></p> <p>Whatever else may be said about Michael Howard's keynote speech to the Tory conference yesterday, its achievement in wringing a straightforward front page news story out of the Independent should not be sneered at. The report says Mr Howard \"made clear he would fight the general election on a rightwing agenda\" and \"hardened his rhetoric on Europe as he sought to stem a haemorrhage of support to the UK Independence Party\". He promised that on their first day in power (insert your own jibe here), the Tories would set an early date for a referendum on the proposed EU constitution, and that they would wrest back control of employment policy and fisheries.</p> <p>Over at the Guardian, too, Mr Howard may find comfort. Simon Hoggart writes warmly of \"the most effective part of the speech ... when he spoke movingly and personally about how his mother-in-law died of a hospital superbug, and his grandmother was killed in one of Hitler's concentration camps\". Hoggart also gets in a dig at Mr Howard's vowels, but then that's a sketch writer's job.</p> <p>The Times, too is impressed. Its leader praises the speech, noting that though it emphasised action over words, it was deftly worded. It says that, whatever the state of the rest of the Tory party, Mr Howard is the clear and rightful leader of it.</p> <p>Mr Howard will get the biggest boost, though, from the Telegraph, which awards him a front page photo, a full rundown of key points on an inside page and a glowing leader: \"Michael Howard plays a blinder by the seaside.\" The leader column is full of tides turning for the Tories, cultural shifts and \"conservatism coming back into vogue\". We'll see.</p> <p>And the bad news? The Telegraph's sketch writer disloyally finds him \"courageously, magnificently dull\". The Independent, having been so commendably fair and balanced on the news pages, gets stuck in for pretty much the whole comment section. It was \"the speech of a leader whose party is on the back foot\", says the leader column. The problem, says Johann Hari, is \"not the singer but the song\"; Michael Howard is all very well, but the Tories need new ideas. Michael Brown says \"one good speech, one autumn morning\" does not alter his conviction that the Tory party is dying.</p> <p>The most damning responses come from the Guardian, though one suspects Mr Howard will not be losing too much sleep about losing voters from the Tory party's Guardian-reading constituency. Polly Toynbee says the man who towered over the Tory conference was not Michael Howard, but Tony Blair, who is now a political colossus of the stature of Margaret Thatcher. The Guardian leader darkly mutters that Mr Howard \"seems to have struck a dirty deal with John Redwood [a noted Eurosceptic] to persuade the businessman Paul Sykes to stop bankrolling Ukip. From a man who says he wants to give it to us straight, this seems very much like the old politics as usual.\"</p> <p>*<a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=569234\">Independent: Howard: Back to basics</a><br> *<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/10/06/dl0601.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/10/06/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Michael Howard plays a blinder by the seaside</a><br> *<a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/conservatives2004/comment/0,15018,1320440,00.html\">Mining Europhobia</a><br></p> <p> <b>SOMEONE HAD BLUNDERED</b></p> <p>Meanwhile, the election campaign in America was heating up with last night's televised vice-presidential debate between the incumbent Dick Cheney, and the would-be John Edwards.

The Guardian speculates that this solves the mystery of Atlantis; apparently Plato's description of the lost kingdom meets that of the lost principality.

  "<p>If the Conservatives are serious about winning the next election, they may want to radically rethink how their palette of policies will play to women voters. So far, it ain't looking good. The party is failing to capitalise on the dwindling ranks of women loyal to Tony Blair's words, with the Liberal Democrats the only prospective electoral winners.</p> <p>Yesterday's speech by the party's family spokeswoman, Theresa May, singularly failed to address the aspirations of women - the key determinants of the next general election. Instead, her radical call to scrap the Children and Families Court Advisory Support Service (Cafcass), which runs the guardian service representing children in parental access cases, is more likely to please fathers at the sharp end of child access battles than women - though grandmothers caught up in the fray may disagree.</p> <p>Though Ms May has either expediently or mistakenly fudged the difference between Cafcass and the overall family court service its guardians attend, campaign group Fathers4Justice will no doubt feel suitably rewarded for members' unlawful antics which have caused traffic chaos and security breaches, in a bid to change the law which routinely favours women as prime carers, with sometimes limited offerings for absent fathers. But it isn't men's votes the Tories need as much as women's, and now is not the time for complacency.</p> <p>Because if securing male votes was what winning a general election was all about, then by rights the Labour party would have won every general election since 1945. But it was their Conservative counterparts who bagged all but three post-war terms until Blair swept to power in 1997 and it was the women what won it for them. The women's vote is seen a crucial determinant of an election victory, representing 52% of the electorate.</p> <p>With only the scrapping of Cafcass on the family political table, coupled with a wasted opportunity in which Ms May could only limply promise some sort of childcare policy in the offing, women could feel shortchanged and mark their cross accordingly. The best Ms May could do to fill out her speech was a litany of platitudes and a reiteration of general policies on health, education and law and order. While family does not equal women, it was the obvious platform to single them out on, particularly in a Conservative world which pretty much does see the two as synonymous.</p> <p>The omission of any policy that directly panders to women's concerns coincides with a report this week by the Fawcett Society which claims that the Conservative party is going in \"reverse gear\" in its bid to woo women voters, dimming even further its prospects at the next general election.</p> <p>The party traditionally seen as a magnet for the female vote has now bucked the trend by being more popular among the male electorate. Yet, despite a decline in New Labour's popularity among women since its last general election victory, the Conservatives have failed to capitalise on their opponents' losses, figures show.</p> <p>Only a quarter of women voters are satisfied with new Tory leader Michael Howard's performance, with his tenure more popular among male voters. Yet this will not an election win.</p> <p>With this year's conference a pilot site for testing out new policies under the steer of Michael Howard to the prospective electorate, there has yet been little in the past two days to appeal to women voters, either in the personal or the family sphere.</p> <p>While the grey vote is being wooed through pensions and promises to cut back or scrap the council tax, women - the majority gender in the UK - are not being similarly seduced by specific policy pledges.</p> <p>The only caveat to date has been proposals unveiled by the shadow work and pension spokesman, David Willetts, to overhaul national insurance, which he claims unfairly penalises women who often break off from continuous contributions because of family responsibilities.</p> <p>This policy deficit contrasts sharply with New Labour's commitments to introduce affordable, flexible childcare for parents to enable primary carers - usually women - to enable them to work, free of the nightmares of finding appropriate supervision for their children.</p> <p>Its commitment to ensure four weeks holiday for all workers, exclusive of the eight annual bank holidays, is also something women - whether parents or not - can firmly relate to. Ditto the minimum wage, now increased to \u00a34.85, and the move to ensure the 1.3 million working in the female-dominated NHS workforce see a raised minimum salary under the roll out of the Agenda for Change pay reform plan.</p> <p>It concludes that the Tory party urgently needs to formulate convincing policies that will appeal to the female electorate if they are to recover electorally. And in order for these policies to be credible, they must be presented and delivered by more women.</p> <p>Credibility aside, a separate report on gender participation in politics published earlier this year by the Electoral Commission found that women voters are more likely to vote for a female candidate. Tough call for the Tories, with 91% of its parliamentary seats held by men, reflected in a thin smattering in its shadow cabinet - Theresa May holding the highest profile.</p> <p>Conservatives need to know their limits with the male electorate and start to see the opportunities that women present, both as candidates, and as the wider electorate. A cramming session on New Labour's style could be just the ticket.</p>",
  "<p>\"Nikki Piper is everything you want from a local government officer. Give her a target and she achieves it,\" says David Broughton, head of education and information management at Cambridgeshire county council. Broughton nominated Piper for the Public Servant of the Year Award for her work in setting up the Ask Cedric consumer website.</p> <p>Ask Cedric, which stands for Consumer Education Resources and Information Centre, is an attractive and easily navigated interactive website. Cedric sets out to give businesses, educational institutions and the community information about consumer rights and the law. Piper read law at university but a talk by a trading standards officer in her last year at university enthused her and before she had even finished her degree she had landed a job in trading standards in Bexley. She moved to Cambridgeshire five years ago with a brief to educate schools and the community about consumer rights.</p> <p>However, Piper realised that because consumer rights covers such a huge field she and other officers would often generate material that then remained unused for months. She tried to get funding to run a regional version of Cedric for schools so the material was not wasted but was turned down for funding. </p> <p>Instead of giving up, Piper came up with a template for Cedric to go nationwide: \"I knew it was a good idea, I knew it was needed, so I decided to carry on pursuing funding from the Department for Trade and Industry.\" </p> <p>Piper was so committed that she travelled to Manchester to buttonhole a key senior civil servant and argue her case: \"I physically put my proposal in his hands.\" Within a fortnight she had been invited down to London to discuss the proposal. Two years ago the DTI agreed to fund the website. </p> <p>Two years ago, the site was launched as an educational tool for schools. Last year the council launched the business component of the website. This June Cambridgeshire launched the community part of the site. </p> <p>There are many consumer groups which produce good information for the wider community and teachers. But Piper found that teachers were put off by the range of material they were given: \"While a lot of groups produce very good packs they can be very big because we cover such a wide area from food and health to advertising, finance and redress.\" </p> <p>Instead, Piper, whose full title is Ask Cedric Project Manager for Cambridgeshire County Council Trading Standards Service, tried to change the way she and her team worked. \"We tried to stop seeing things from a trading standards point of view. We tried to see our work from an educational viewpoint instead. So we mapped the information we had across the national curriculum with different information for different key stages.\" </p> <p>Piper laughs as she says that teachers like it \"because it is free, of course. Cedric provides teaching plans, notes worksheets and practical activities. Teachers can dip in and out as they see fit. I see it as a library where we have filed information in a way that teachers can recognise.\"</p> <p>Flush from the success of the educational elements of the website, the team started to create the business section. \"Businesses need this information,\" says Broughton. \"There is a lot of bureaucracy out there for businesses when they are set up. We can't get round to every new business so instead we developed training modules that could be pulled off the website. It allows us to get on with other work and visit those who need us most.\" </p> <p>It is the business section which is the most interactive at present, Piper explains. \"You type in your business sector, say a pub with accommodation, and the site will tell you with which parts of the law you need to comply. We want to make it even more interactive to give businesses really specific information and we want to step up our work with trade associations so they can promote Cedric more widely.\"</p> <p>The DTI insisted that the information on the website should be freely available to all. There are no passwords or annual subscription fees and other enforcement agencies are free to use the material as they see fit.</p> <p>While Cambridgeshire county council maintains control of the site, it has developed links with key partners including the Financial Services Authority, the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux, the National Consumer Council and the Personal Finance Education Group. </p> <p>John Lawrence, head of trading standards at Cambridgeshire county council, believes that without Piper those organisations would not have come on board so quickly. \"Nikki exudes enthusiasm and makes people around her feel committed to projects. When you are working with outside organisations you need someone like Nikki who can infect others with that kind of enthusiasm.\" </p> <p>This year Cambridgeshire county council launched the community element to the website, which offers information on such subjects as scams, homeworking and doorstep selling. The website is updated to take account of current consumer concerns. At the moment the team is generating materials for the community and schools about counterfeiting. </p> <p>\"The other team members laugh and say that Cedric is my child,\" says Piper. \"But it is, really. I want to carry on with it, I would hate to give Cedric.\" Broughton sees Piper as \"a real high flyer\". \"She will go far. She has put in an awful lot of hours because of her dedication to the project.\" </p> <p>The schools section of the website has won an educational award and Cedric won a Trading Standards Institute for Excellence medal last year. Despite that, Cambridgeshire has to bid for funding to maintain the website year on year from the DTI. </p> <p>\"Feedback from other organisations, including local authorities and central government has been fantastic,\" says Lawrence. \"Cedric obviously met a need that was out there and was unmet. It is a really great initiative and it is a great honour for Nikki and the whole team to be nominated for this award.\"</p>",
  "<p>Despite a childhood in a sucession of care homes where he suffered sexual and physical abuse, Thomas Harvey-Beswick decided, at the age of 21, to risk financial ruin to provide a safe and stable home for homeless people with acute mental health conditions, drug and alcohol dependency and emotional problems. </p> <p>Twenty years on, his not-for-profit organisation, Fernbank Care in the Community, owns three houses and a hostel in Wolverhampton, and has been home to more than 125 people who have been through prisons or mental health services and ended up on the streets. </p> <p>Despite the fact that Fernbank's homes are in inner city locations, he says he has never had any problems with \"nimbyism'\" from neighbours and not a single complaint about the residents.</p> <p>Aged 16, Harvey-Beswick got a job in Coventry as a residential care worker with people with mental and physical health problems. He moved to Wolverhampton to get more social work experience just as the Conservative policy of Care in the Community was forcing thousands of people with mental health problems out onto the streets after, in many cases, many years of institutional life.</p> <p>Harvey-Beswick recalls: \"I saw these people were having real difficulties with their isolation, frustration and bewilderment at the reality of everyday life outside. Many would re-offend or become a danger to themselves or others. I couldn't do enough for them simply as a care worker so I decided to start out on my own.\"</p> <p>He rented a dilapidated terrace house and went out looking for clients. His first was George Fury, a homeless alcoholic who he found stuck in an old TB sanatorium. \"George was wonderful. He used to sit playing an imaginary harmonica all day. But he was with us for 14 years until he died and this became his home as it has for lots of others. One man called Jim has been with us for nearly 20 years and he calls Fernbank his home.\"</p> <p>The next client was referred by probation services; he was on parole after serving a sentence for armed robbery. Iris Griffiths started cleaning toilets for Ferndale 15 years ago. Now a director of the company, she recalls: \"The first places were really grim, we had no sanitation and the roof was falling in, but these were at least taking people off the streets and giving them a home, warmth and food.\"</p> <p>After several unsatisfactory locations, Harvey-Beswick heard of a hotel for sale in 1990 that fitted the bill. \"It had en suite rooms with tea and coffee making facilities and kitchens. The problem was it was on sale for \u00a3235,000. We went to a lot of mortgage brokers only to be told we had to be joking. No-one thought we could make a go of a not for profit hostel for homeless people where the ethos was that they would have control of their benefits money. Eventually a company in Birmingham took a chance but said I had better get some management backing or I was in danger of losing not only the hotel but my own home as well.\"</p> <p>Neither was Harvey-Beswick's unorthodox approach popular with the local authority. In October 1992, Wolverhampton city council - the hostel's main source of revenue - froze rent payments for all eight residents. \"They said that they didn't like the way I was doing things and decided to pull the rent. I told them that they were putting vulnerable people at risk and that myself and the rest of the staff who were working for minimal rates of pay anyway, were working for free. It was only when I said that it wouldn't be very nice if they read the comments from residents about what the council had done in the Express and Star that they turned around and reinstated payments.\"</p> <p>Money in the form of fixed rate benefits payments arrived in December, just in time for Christmas. Griffiths remembers that she and Harvey-Beswick rushed out on a Christmas Eve shopping present shopping expedition so that all the residents had at least one present on Christmas Day and a big Christmas lunch.</p> <p>While Griffiths says they have not received the greatest of support from official sources the project has been backed by an unlikely patron - Motown superstar Martha Reeves - as a result of Harvey-Beswick running the British fan clubs for both Reeves and Aretha Franklin. Fernbank's annual report is decorated with autographed pictures of soul diva Martha, and she is flying in to do a benefit gig in Wolverhampton next month.</p> <p>Fernbank has grown from an eight-bed project to one which offers semi-independent living for 28 people in three houses near the original hostel. There is a parallel project providing accommodation for a further 20 people in Walsall.</p> <p>Harvey-Beswick's nomination for the Public Servant of the Year Award came from his partner, Darren Harvey, who is also a director of Fernbank. Harvey says: \"He has put the care of clients before any financial obligations by taking in every person regardless of the level of their benefits. He has taken in clients who received no benefit because they were so mentally ill they did not know how to claim benefit. He was without money for up to six months while administration staff dealt with it.\"</p> <p>Belinda Flavell, a Fernbank resident for nine years, adds: \"He is really amazing. I don't know where I would be without him and Fernbank - all he does is for us.\"</p> <p>Speaking about the nomination, Harvey-Beswick says: \"It's great to get recognition after so long. Even if I don't win I will still have the satisfaction of knowing that I have gone my own way, providing a safe, stable home where everyone can come to terms with their problems at their own pace rather than placing restrictions on their recovery. And I think our success means that I have been proved right.\"</p>",
  "Maurice Saatchi, the veteran advertising executive who helped devise the 1979 \"Labour Isn't Working\" slogan that put Margaret Thatcher into power, made his Tory conference debut yesterday in order to unveil the formula which he says will drive Labour from office: Satisfaction equals Performance minus Expectation. <p>What Lord Saatchi, now an erudite Tory spokesman in the upper house, calls \"Saatchi's Law\" was his own attempt to beat political philosophers down the ages who have failed to find the political equivalent of the laws of science: to predict the future. </p> <p>He told the Bournemouth conference that Labour's alleged \"big idea\" that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown could combine social justice with economic efficiency had left poor people paying 63% of their income in tax, and the government hiring more and more staff for public services that were not getting better - despite \"seven years of Labour moralising\". </p> <p>Mocking the Guardian's Society section in passing, Lord Saatchi lamented that more and more managers were needed to \"set, monitor and report\" on futile government targets. </p> <p>But voters, \"because they know everything\", understood this. </p> <p>Hence his law: \"Expectation high, performance poor, satisfaction low,\" which had produced unprecedented levels of public disaffection.</p> <p>Lord Saatchi said ministers tried to get away with it by massaging the figures to halve the inflation rate, double NHS productivity, and slash poverty.</p> <p>But they had been caught out by the independent Statistics Commission, which had accused them of breaching \"the letter and spirit\" of the rules.</p> <p>Last night Richard Alldritt, the commission's chief executive, replied: \"It's far too sweeping. </p> <p>\"Lord Saatchi is conflating several different things.\"</p>",
  "<p>Twink is walking along a rocky shore. It's a lonely-looking place, with big, unfriendly boulders, and a sea mist shrouds everything in gloom. Twink is bipolar. \"The darks of depression can become so dark you can't even see your hand in front of your face,\" he says. \"You feel as if you can't relate to anybody, never mind yourself.\"</p> <p>Then there are also periods of mania when, Twink says, he attains tremendous levels of confidence and creativity. He's actually experienced what it feels like to be the second coming. </p> <p>He stops to photograph a rusty bit of a ship. And an old chain, huge, like the one hanging behind Isambard Kingdom Brunel in a famous photograph. This is <strong>MadforArts</strong> (Five), five short films, one each day this week, about mental illness and art. I'm not quite sure how they got away with that name, but they're lovely films. </p> <p>Twink's thing is the Angel of the North, so from the beach we go to Antony Gormley's famous figure. Twink sees the Angel as an icon of manic depression. From the south side, it's grandiose - mania encapsulated. Walk around it and you see its darker side. \"It's just such a good feeling to be able to relate to this particular piece of work. Whether it's in depression or in mania you're always wanting to go somewhere else. And looking up at the sculpture it just seems to want to fly away.\" </p> <p>Twink's story was screened on Monday night. Last night, we saw Emma's. Bullied at school, her reaction was to harm herself. She's 29 now, but talks about the bullying in the present tense, as if it was happening now. \"I can't control how much they hurt me, but I can control how much I hurt myself. And I can hurt myself a lot worse than they can.\" Her arms are covered with the scars of self-abuse. She holds on tightly to her pet rabbit. </p> <p>Before making this programme, Emma has only ever seen Turner's paintings on the internet. Now she makes the trip up from Sussex to see an exhibition at Tate Britain. \"They've blown my mind away,\" she says, standing in front of a picture with her hands in front of her face. It's the skies that do it. \"When I first looked at it, it looked rainy, then I noticed a bit of blue sky at the top. Like a little bit of hope.\" </p> <p>Emma somehow takes a Turneresque sky with her back to Sussex. As she sits with another pet, her poodle, on the beach, an amazing, cloudy sunset explodes behind her. \"When the sun sets it means I've made it through another day,\" she says. \"One day at a time.\" </p> <p>They are no experts but I'd rather listen to Twink and Emma than many art critics. It means so much for them, and is so personal. </p> <p>It's interesting that Twink and Emma were both filmed at the seaside, as well as with the works of art they love. On screen, there is often an association between mental illness and the sea. It's almost as if someone is saying: \"We've got one with mental health issues here, better get them down to the beach. And bring the pets along.\" </p> <p>There was no seaside in <strong>Loving Christian - This Is My family</strong> (BBC2), but there were a couple of pets - Christian's parents' talking parrot and his nan's little dog. Christian is 30 and has suffered from schizophrenia since he was 16. </p> <p>Again, this was a moving film - both warm and sad. It's interesting that two programmes about mental-health issues were shown in one evening. It's no longer something taboo, a subject to be locked away and forgotten about. Television is getting more confident at admitting mental illness exists. </p> <p>Christian can almost cope and he lives in his own flat. But he looks troubled and lost. \"I'm all right,\" he says. \"I've just had enough of not knowing what to do with my day.\" </p> <p>Would Christian like to share his life with someone, to have a relationship? \"Yeah I do, yeah I do, I do yeah. Sometimes I think a woman with nice hair would be nice. You know.\" </p> <p>His parents would love Christian to have someone else in his life, and are obviously terrified of what will happen to him when they die. They've even thought of trying to finding him a Thai bride on the internet. Well, why not? As long as she has nice hair.</p>",
  "Tony Blair will today fly to the Sudan to warn the Khartoum government that it must act swiftly to end the atrocities and refugee crisis in its western region of Darfur, mainly by allowing as many as 5,000 African Union peacekeeping troops free movement into the region this month. <p>The visit is a sign of Mr Blair's personal commitment to end \"the worst humanitarian crisis in Africa since Rwanda\", but carries big political risks if indifference within the international community means the refugees continue to be attacked with impunity. </p> <p>Mr Blair, the first serving British prime minister to visit an independent Sudan, will meet the Sudanese president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, this morning in Khartoum.</p> <p>The prime minister's hand is strengthened by the threat of UN-imposed sanctions still hanging over the Arab-dominated Sudanese government. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, reported yesterday that Khartoum had made no progress in the past month in meeting the terms of two UN security council resolutions passed earlier this year.</p> <p>Aid agencies, notably Oxfam, speaking from Darfur yesterday warned that \"beatings and rapes were continuing on a daily basis\", and urged Mr Blair to extract specific assurances about an expanded mandate for the African Union troops due to protect the refugees and aid agencies. </p> <p>There have been calls for Britain to provide logistical support to the AU troops, but there is no plan for largescale British military involvement.</p> <p>Mr Blair can also offer the carrot of further EU and British aid if the Sudanese government negotiates a comprehensive peace deal due to be discussed with the main rebel groups later this month.</p> <p>The international community has been accused of acting too late to prevent what the US government has called the genocide of black Africans by the Arab government.</p> <p>Mr Bashir, a former host of Osama bin Laden, seized power in a coup in 1989 and has spent nearly 20 years suppressing an independence movement in the south of the country. He insists he has no control over the militias in the Darfur region, describing them as outlaws, and saying his police have done everything possible to secure general disarmament. Few at the UN accept his denials of responsibility.</p> <p>Drastic oil sanctions against Sudan have so far been averted by the threat of a UN veto by China, and the Khartoum government's as yet untested acceptance of as many as 5,000 Africa Union troops into the country to monitor the ceasefire and ensure safe passage for aid workers. At present, there are fewer than 300 AU troops in Darfur, an impoverished region larger than France, and their chief mandate is to protect 60 ceasefire monitors.</p> <p>The aid agencies said yesterday they were concerned that the British government was misleading itself into believing the humanitarian crisis was easing at a time when 1.4 million refugees remained in camps running out of fresh water and shelter. Mr Blair's spokesman said that there had been an improvement in the supply of humanitarian aid in urban, but not rural areas, partly due to UN pressure.</p> <p>Reports suggest that Sudanese government-supported militias, mainly the Janjaweed, have killed as many as 50,000 non-Arabs in a campaign of ethnic cleansing - acts condemned by the US government as genocide, which implies an organised government intent to commit mass murder. Britain says it will await the result of a UN-sponsored commission of inquiry before deciding whether Mr Bashir's government is directly responsible for the deaths.</p> <p>Speaking from Nyala in the south of Darfur, Oxfam aid worker Adrian McIntyre said: \"People in the camps are still suffering from daily violence nearly six months after a ceasefire, including rapes, beatings and humiliations such as cutting women's hair.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair is likely to urge Mr Bashir to look for a long-term political solution. But the prime minister, in the region for a two-day meeting of his commission for Africa, will meet stiff opposition since prominent Sudanese officials earlier this week ruled out any notion of self-rule for Darfur.</p> <p>The agriculture minister, Majzoub al-Khalifa, head of the government's Darfur peace talks delegation, questioned whether Khartoum would even continue negotiating with one of the rebel groups in the talks scheduled to resume later this month.</p>",
  "<p>The government is under pressure to revive plans for a string of new and expanded super-tram projects in English cities, particularly in Leeds and Manchester, after pressure from John Prescott and local MPs.</p> <p>Transport planners have told the government they can reduce costs to answer Whitehall fears that they are spiralling out of control. </p> <p>In Leeds, the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority has followed the example of its counterpart in Greater Manchester by asking for a meeting with Alistair Darling, the transport secretary, to put their 15-mile project back on track. </p> <p>At Labour's conference last week the minister told north-west MPs - who have already taken their protests to Tony Blair - he would consider revised plans for the Manchester system, known as Metrolink. </p> <p>In July Mr Darling announced that the government was withdrawing funding for the Leeds scheme and a three-fold expansion of Greater Manchester's 20-mile network because of rising costs. </p> <p>West Yorkshire MPs feel that a promise to bring costs closer to the initial \u00a3355m estimate - from the current \u00a3500m - will convince the minister that the proposed network is worth backing. </p> <p>In a letter to Mr Darling, Liberal Democrat, Tory and Green leaders in Leeds' new cross-party coalition said \"excellent\" progress had been made in cutting costs to make the \"super-tram\" project affordable. </p> <p>But it is likely that the scheme will be scaled down from an original plan involving lines from the city centre to Lawnswood in the north, a spur to Stourton and to Tingley in the south and Whinmoor in the east. </p> <p>Councils and MPs in Leeds and in Manchester have taken comfort from the embarrassment in John Prescott's local government and regions department, which has been pushing super-tram schemes as an essential boost for regenerating rundown areas. </p> <p>Emboldened by the success of the Manchester Metrolink, hailed as the most successful light-rail project in the country carrying 50,000 people daily, the deputy prime minister said when he was transport supremo in 2000 that he wanted 25 more schemes by 2010. He hailed the Manchester scheme, which runs from Bury in the north to Altrincham in the south, as \"exactly the kind of infrastructure project we need\". </p> <p>But with expansion costs in Manchester soaring from \u00a3489m to \u00a3900m, Mr Darling pulled the plug in July, while shelving the Leeds scheme along with one in Portsmouth. </p> <p>Claiming that Leeds is the third largest and fastest growing city in Britain, transport planners in West Yorkshire argue that a super-tram is essential to meet the demands of developers - some of whom agreed to multimillion pound projects after the promise of a super-tram system. </p> <p>An estimated 32,000 new jobs could be created in Leeds in the next 10 years, representing 40% of all employment growth in Yorkshire. With almost 75% of the jobs likely to be filled by people commuting to Leeds, planners say there is no capacity for extra cars. \"A fast and efficient means of getting these people into and out of the city is essential,\" according to recent study. </p> <p>Whatever happens, the initial timescale will be adrift. Work in Leeds was due to begin this year, with the first trams running by 2007. New city squares have been designed with the tram in mind. </p> <p>In Manchester, the local transport authority has already spent, or committed, \u00a3200m to buy land and demolish houses for new routes. Mr Prescott is keen to get the schemes back on track before an international urban summit he is hosting in Manchester in January.</p>",
  "<p>Supermarket group J Sainsbury yesterday announced the departure of its finance director Roger Matthews. His exit comes just two weeks before new chief executive Justin King unveils his review of the underperforming chain and the changes he intends to make to restore its fortunes. </p> <p>Mr Matthews becomes the sixth board director to leave J Sainsbury this year as the supermarket chain faces declining sales and plunging profits. </p> <p>In a stock exchange statement, J Sainsbury said that Mr Matthews, 50, had made it clear he wanted to quit three months ago, when new chairman Philip Hampton was appointed. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Hampton said: \"We both consider now is the best time to begin to move towards an orderly succession. We have started the process for the appointment of his successor.\" Headhunters Egon Zehnder have been appointed. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said that Mr Matthews, had opted to take early retirement and would not be receiving a pay-off. </p> <p>Mr King has already delivered one big profits warning since his arrival - profits this year will tumble to levels not seen since 1989 - and investors are concerned that a further deterioration in trading may force another alert with the October 19 review. </p> <p>There is also speculation that the founding Sainsbury family, who still control 34% of the company, will consider a sale if there are no signs of a halt to the decline by next spring. </p> <p>Mr Matthews was paid a salary of \u00a3445,000 last year and was the only Sainsbury director to receive a performance bonus. He was awarded \u00a3178,000 for selling off Sainsbury's US offshoot, Shaw's. </p> <p>Mr King, who joined the company in March, removed managing director Stuart Mitchell shortly after his arrival. Joint managing director Sara Weller had quit three days before the former Asda man's arrival. In July he lost chairman Sir Peter Davis, who was forced out after shareholder protests about his entitlement to a multi-million bonus. Non-executive directors Keith Butler-Wheelhouse and Lord Levene also left. </p> <p>Mr Matthews is keen to get involved, in an operational capacity, in the world of rugby football \"combining his functional expertise in finance with his sporting passion\", said the spokeswoman. \"He does not want another FTSE-100 role.\" </p> <p>The shares closed down 4p at 255.25p.</p>",

The first sharp intake of breath, in a night of gasps and little yelps, from the audience at this magical, all-male Russian Twelfth Night, came as Alexei Dadonov's Olivia - more a lady than any woman could be - lit up and seemed to extract an almost obscene amount of pleasure from her cigarette. Smoking in a public place is not only frowned upon now in Dublin, it is illegal.

  "<p>Michael Howard yesterday gave Conservatives a clear reminder of why they were right to get rid of Iain Duncan Smith as their leader. Mr Duncan Smith's nasty and ill-judged party conference speech in Blackpool a year ago was another reminder of how difficult it has been for successive Tory leaders, from John Major onwards, to find an effective rhetorical alternative to Tony Blair. Mr Howard had clearly given a lot of thought to that problem. His answer was an intelligent one: to avoid grandiloquence, to adopt a more explicatory tone, to make his story more personal (resulting in some particularly effective passages) and, above all, to offer himself as an alternative kind of politician, a man with his feet on the ground not his head in the clouds, as Lord Saatchi put it yesterday. </p> <p>As far as it goes, this is an attractive strategy. We badly need a more truthful and accountable form of politics. But Mr Howard also gave his party a reminder of why he has not solved many of their more basic problems. An opposition party that is in danger of losing a third successive election needs to fire up its supporters, not to dampen them down; so, while Mr Howard can be commended for not opting for negative attacks, he can also be criticised for not giving his party clear lines on which to campaign against Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who were barely mentioned in the speech. </p> <p>It was also bad luck for Mr Howard that the evangelical Blair style against which his speech was so self-consciously constructed was also rather conspicuously abandoned by the prime minister in Brighton; Mr Howard, in other words, may be attacking a diminishing target. But the biggest problem was simply this: Mr Howard is an old-style politician to his finger-tips. For this most barristerial of all politicians to pose as an \"anti-politician\" is inherently implausible. </p> <p>The chief criticism of his speech was not its style but its substance. The list of subjects which the Tory leader failed to address was a long one. It included the economy and the business agenda - an almost incredible omission by a Tory leader in the run-up to an election - the environment, constitutional reform (Europe inevitably excepted), and the great traditional Tory rallying-cry of individual freedom. In the video shown to delegates before Mr Howard's entrance, freedom was a central theme (to the stirring accompaniment of Elgar's Nimrod); in his speech, he had almost nothing to say about it. And he bottled out of saying that the imperative to obey the law extends to the law on hunting with dogs. </p> <p>The speech was stronger on cliches than on firm pledges. The Tory leader tried to give the impression that a Howard government would spring instantly into life with an all-action agenda, but the commitments were few and general. Mr Howard said almost nothing of substance on health, education and pensions, beyond people being entitled to choice. The section on tax was deliberately opaque. The most settled prospectus was his old Home Office specialities of crime and immigration. </p> <p>The most striking and most carefully constructed part was on Europe. Here the pledges suddenly got more specific - a referendum on the EU constitution by September 2005, withdrawal from the social chapter, from the common fisheries policy and from EU overseas aid programmes. The delegates responded fervently - a sign of the Tory party's undiminished grassroots Europhobia. The big question in the conference corridors remains whether such pledges are enough to blunt the challenge of the UK Independence party. Mr Howard seems to have struck a dirty deal with John Redwood to persuade the businessman Paul Sykes to stop bankrolling Ukip. From a man who says he wants to give it to us straight, this seems very much like old politics as usual.</p>",
  "Michael Howard yesterday ratcheted up the Conservative campaign against European integration when he promised to set an early date for a referendum on the EU constitution on the first day of his premiership - and to \"go further\" in pulling back powers from Brussels. <p>On the day that the UK Independence party, his rival for Eurosceptic votes, saw its main financial backer return to the Tory fold, Mr Howard made no attempt to disguise his determination to thwart Ukip's boast that it is poised to \"kill\" the Tories. \"Come and join us,\" he told defectors. </p> <p>Promoting his \"pick and mix\" policy for allowing EU member states to integrate or not, as they wish, Mr Howard said yesterday that rapidly saying no to a written constitution and later to the euro would not be enough. </p> <p>\"It's time we went further\" by repatriating the social chapter, the EU fishing policy and other powers, he said. </p> <p>Pro-Europeans and unions expressed dismay at what they regard as pandering to the Ukip menace, despite the internal Ukip bickering triggered by millionaire Paul Sykes's move back to the Tories. It saw Robert Kilroy-Silk MEP, Ukip's new star, being told to become \"a team player\" by his leader, Roger Knapman. </p> <p>The Conservative leader used his first keynote conference speech to offer a package of tough and immediate steps to address voters' concerns on crime, drugs, dirty hospitals, immigration control and lower taxes in ways he hopes will lower public cynicism towards politics. </p> <p>To further demonstrate that the Tories are back in touch with the domestic concerns of the electorate, Mr Howard eschewed visionary rhetoric or goals in favour of 10 notably down-to-earth words he wants his canvassers to offer disaffected Labour voters when the expected May 2005 election is called. </p> <p>They are: \"School discipline, more police, cleaner hospitals, lower taxes, controlled immigration,\" and will be underpinned by the recurring word in Mr Howard's speech of abject apology for the failings of the political class - \"accountability\". </p> <p>In a series of policy promises which a Howard cabinet will be expected to deliver in days, weeks and months of taking office - or face the sack - Mr Howard told conference: \"On day one, we will set the date for the referendum on the constitution. </p> <p>\"So if the election is next May, we will hold that referendum before we meet again next October. Europe isn't working properly today and the constitution will only make matters worse.\" </p> <p>The \"day one\" emphasis reflects the Howard team's belief that \"Tony Blair has been all talk\" and windy rhetoric, and that voters now want action. To show what they can do in the first month of power the Tories will set out a full \"timetable for action\" when their conference closes tomorrow. </p> <p>Mr Howard's 48-minute speech reflected both his low-key style and a conscious desire not to make sustained personalised attacks on Tony Blair or Charles Kennedy, though Mr Blair was again accused on \"not telling the truth\" over the Iraq war and of betrayal over 66 \"stealth tax\" rises. </p> <p>\"Everyone's been let down by Labour on tax,\" he said. \"If Labour were to win again, we'd have Blair's third term tax rises.\" </p> <p>But he avoided specific tax promises until after the Tories have seen their own savings plans and Gordon Brown's next budget.</p> <p>\"When I can, I will cut taxes... taxes I want to make fairer, simpler, lower. But I'm not like Tony Blair. I'm not going to make promises I can't keep... we must be honest with the British people. It's that word again, accountability,\" Mr Howard said.</p> <p>Privately, Mr Howard is frustrated that his key messages are not getting through, including more choice in schools and healthcare, more school expulsions and police on the beat and, within his first month, an annual limit on immigration.</p> <p>Mr Howard shares the view of young allies like David Cameron that \"the biggest problem in British politics today is cynicism, apathy and disillusion\".</p> <p>Labour was quick to contrast yesterday's words with the former Tory home secretary's record in reducing police numbers, asylum chaos and rises in some categories of crime.</p>",
  "Michael Howard told his party yesterday: \"When people ask you on the doorstep, 'I can't stand Tony Blair, but why should I vote for you lot?' here are 10 words to remember - school discipline, more police, cleaner hospitals, lower taxes, controlled immigration. Ten words to address the problems that are worrying people today. Remember those words.\" <p>But did they?</p> <p><b> Nicholas Soames</b>, the shadow defence secretary, admitted to the Guardian yesterday: \"Yes... I can, I'm just trying to think back. I heard them before lunch. Crime, dealing with crime. Schools, education... I cannot remember the others.\" </p> <p><b> Sir Paul Beresford</b>, MP for Mole Valley said: \"I could remember them an hour ago but whether I could now is very doubtful - but I will be going home and writing them down.\" </p> <p><b> Vanessa Gearson</b>, Cheltenham candidate Vanessa and a former Tory chief of staff: \"Of course I remember them but I am not going to answer the next question which is what are they! School discipline, lower taxes, erm, control on asylum and immigration... school discipline, lower taxes, control on asylum and immigration...\" </p> <p><b> Sir Patrick Cormack</b>, Staffordshire South MP, commented: \"Well, yes, I think he talked about discipline in schools. He talked about clean hospitals. He talked about policing and more police and, err, what else was it? He took them from an article I wrote in the House magazine conference issue... Lower tax. I got eight out of 10, that's not bad.\"</p> <p><b> Lord Brooke</b>, former Conservative MP, said: \"I might be able to do it backwards - immigration control or controlled immigration, better schools, lower taxes, cleaner hospitals and I have to get one more. Hold on, hold on... there is a friend I have to talk to. Try me later.\"</p> <p><b> John Maples</b>, Howard adviser and Stafford-on-Avon MP, told the Guardian: \"School discipline, clean hospitals, limited immigration or something like that. That's three. Something about the European constitution, no European constitution? More police. I got eight out of 10.\"</p> <p><b> Stephan Shakespeare</b>, pollster and a former aide to Jeffrey Archer: \"I wasn't there for the speech.

  "Next year, Britain is planning to make Africa the centre-piece of its presidencies of the European Union and the G8 industrialised nations. Tony Blair's Commission for Africa, which opens its second meeting in Ethiopia tomorrow to discuss how the international community can help build a \"strong and prosperous Africa\", will be central to that effort. However, the UK government is potentially facing a serious credibility problem on Africa that could undermine its efforts to heal what Blair calls \"the scar on the conscience of the world\". <p>A significant element of any new deal for Africa will be that African governments must clean up corruption and improve their governance. Without a real grappling with corruption, such a deal is likely to be ineffective. Of course, African governments need to show through consistent, effective internal action that they are determined to heal their own ills. But corruption and bribery is a serious problem throughout the world, and much of it originates in, or is facilitated by, western financial centres. </p> <p>African leaders have long said that they need western governments to stop their companies bribing officials and politicians, and their banks helping officials hide looted funds abroad. Britain claims that it is leading the international anti-corruption efforts in these areas, but its practical record does not yet bear that out. </p> <p>In 1997 Britain signed up to the OECD's anti-bribery convention and then passed the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001 to enable prosecutions to be brought against people here for corruption abroad. But Britain has yet to prosecute a single company or individual for overseas bribery. Only two of the over 20 allegations of overseas bribery involving UK citizens or companies are under formal investigation. </p> <p>Britain's response to allegations of wrong doing and bribery involving its companies in Africa has been characterised by foot-dragging and inaction. Take the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In October 2002, the UN released a report detailing how 85 foreign companies illegally exploited Congo's resources. So far none of the British companies it named appears to have been properly investigated. Congo's population of 70 million lives in abject poverty. Despite fabulous mineral deposits, the country's GDP is only a quarter of what it was in 1990. Little or no part of the wealth extracted by western mining companies reaches the state coffers, with revenues from tax and customs sources standing at less than \u00a31bn a year. Ensuring that companies play by the book in Congo would make a real difference to that country. </p> <p>Meanwhile, where African countries have tried to stamp down on corruption, the effort has not always been reciprocated here. For example, in May 2002 a Lesotho official was convicted of receiving nearly \u00a33m in bribes. Lesotho, a tiny, poverty-ridden country in the midst of an HIV epidemic, then took the almost unprecedented move of prosecuting the foreign construction companies that gave the bribes. Three have so far been convicted. Though several British companies have been named in connection with the prosecutions, the UK authorities appear to have taken no steps to investigate their involvement, and financial assistance apparently offered by Britain to help with those prosecutions has not been forthcoming. </p> <p>Of course, such matters could not be more difficult to process, especially in gathering evidence sufficient to satisfy an English jury. But the government has yet to will the extra specialist resources that will give the anti-corruption legislation teeth. The failure to do so is hardly likely to add urgency to the recent efforts of some African administrations, such as the Lesothan government and the Congolese transitional government, to end corruption. </p> <p>Britain's record on repatriating looted assets is little better. In December 2003 the UK signed up to the UN convention against corruption - a central plank of which is the requirement that countries will freeze, confiscate and repatriate such assets. So far the government has no timetable for ratifying that convention. </p> <p>Ironically, last October the Nigerian government finally abandoned its three-year effort to get UK government assistance in recovering $1.3bn in state funds, known to have passed through some 23 British banks, stolen by former president Abacha. Britain failed to provide the Nigerians with any of the key documents they requested. </p> <p>The Commission for Africa and the UK's Africa-focused presidencies of the G8 and EU have real potential to help African countries escape from poverty and corruption. Making sure that the UK's leadership on Africa has credibility in the eyes of Africans, however, will require the government to be much more rigorous in delivering its side of the corruption bargain. Nothing could be more important. UK and western anti-corruption efforts will be undermined without determined action against our own corrupt nationals. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Dr Susan Hawley works with The Corner House, the anti-corruption campaign group; Lord Phillips of Sudbury is a solicitor and Lib Dem life peer </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:susanhawley@blueyonder.co.uk\">susanhawley@blueyonder.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Despite \u00a312bn spending by water companies on sewage and storm water treatment works over 14 years, 95% of British rivers will fail to meet new European standards for water quality if further work is not done, the government conceded yesterday. <p>Since the privatisation of water companies in 1990 there has been a dramatic improvement in the quality of water in rivers, with fish returning to areas which had been dead for 100 years. But the EU rules mean that a new way of managing rivers must be adopted, said the environment minister Elliot Morley. </p> <p>Instead of just using chemical content and dissolved oxygen as a way of measuring the health of rivers, the directive demands much higher standards of river management, including maintaining water flows and diversity of life, and the removal of hormone disrupting substances which are turning thousands of male fish into females. The directive also applies to lakes, estuaries and coastal and ground waters which were previously not measured. </p> <p>In total 82% of all water bodies in the UK are at risk of failing the EU's new standards, and more than half of groundwater sources. About a third of the country's drinking water is extracted from groundwater and it also feeds the springs from which streams and rivers flow. </p> <p>Mr Morley said: \"In effect we are going back to year zero on the health of our rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastline, to a completely new process that looks at the whole ecological balance. It is a huge and important task but one that is welcomed by the government and will be by the public generally.\" </p> <p>Currently 93% of rivers in England are classed as in good or fair condition for chemical content, compared with 73% in 1990. The levels of oxygen have also risen: 95% are of good or fair quality compared with 89% in 1990. </p> <p>Nearly all this improvement had been brought about through \"end of pipe\" solutions, upgrading industrial and sewage disposal facilities, said Sir John Harman, the chairman of the Environment Agency. He said progress had slowed since 2000, with some rivers getting worse again because of low flows caused by drought. </p> <p>\"Around 30% of our rivers, however, still need improvement, and one in six rivers in urban areas are still classed as 'poor' or 'bad'.\" </p> <p>He said the EU directive would provide a more detailed picture of the ecological health of rivers and new ways of measuring quality. </p> <p>Although the new rules from the EU water framework directive do not come into force until 2015, the new targets are so stringent that work must start now in order to reach them. Mr Morley said the government would face prosecution by the EU in 2015 if it failed to make its best efforts to reach the targets. </p> <p>Instead of merely looking at the content of the water and its quality, the whole life of the river and its catchment area must be studied, he said. This started with the quality of the groundwater that feeds the springs, and whether it was polluted because of chemicals soaking into it from farmland. </p> <p>It also dealt with such issues as whether water companies damaged river flow by abstracting too much water from the ground. Chemicals from farms and roads washed directly into rivers was another problem which the directive highlighted and those responsible would be asked to pay the cost of the damage, Mr Morley said. </p> <p>Aspects of river water quality examined will include its temperature, oxygen levels, and nutrients such as nitrogen.

  "<p>The World Health Organisation yesterday suggested there may be an international shortage of flu vaccines this winter as medicines watchdogs suspended the British manufacturing licence of the world's second-largest supplier. </p> <p>The three-month ban on Chiron Vaccines' plant in Speke, Liverpool, means that the company will not supply any of its Fluvirin product during the northern hemisphere's flu season. UK health authorities say they have made alternative arrangements to make up for the loss of Chiron's near 20% share of NHS supplies, although GPs have complained that they have had to reschedule clinics because of late notice of the problems and interrupted delivery. </p> <p>The NHS flu vaccination campaign in Britain, which uses five other suppliers, was only launched on Monday. It aims to give 14m doses, mostly to people 65 and over and those with chronic illness, and it was not clear last night whether vaccinations delivered privately might be hit. The manufacturing process for flu vaccines takes months. </p> <p>In the US, the company had expected to supply nearly half the 100m doses of vaccine this year and Klaus Stohr, the WHO's head of influenza control, said there could be \"significant implications\" for supplies elsewhere. \"It may be resolvable but that would require a lot of adjustment on the part of other companies,\" he told Associated Press. </p> <p>The Chiron Corporation, parent of the vaccine company, which is the second largest supplier of flu vaccine in the world, said the decision by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) would mean it would not supply any vaccine this flu season. In August Chiron had admitted \"a small number of lots\" tested for the US market had not met product sterility specifications but said internal investigations indicated \"no widespread issues with the manufacturing process\". </p> <p>Chiron's president and chief executive officer, Howard Pien, said the company \"deeply regrets that we will be unable to meet public health needs this season\". </p> <p>In a statement, the company added that it had hoped the MHRA, the Liverpool plant's regulator, would have completed the review process in time to allow release of the vaccine early this month. </p> <p>\"However, the MHRA has asserted that Chiron's manufacturing process does not comply with UK good manufacturing process regulations and has suspended the company's Liverpool facility licence to manufacture influenza vaccine for six months. Chiron has initiated discussions with the MHRA to determine appropriate corrective actions.\" </p> <p>The plant concerned used to be owned by Powderject, run by the Labour party donor Paul Drayson, once at the heart of a row over a contract for smallpox vaccines, but that company was bought by Chiron last year. </p> <p>The MHRA last night declined to say why it had suspended the Liverpool plant's licence, beyond citing \"a problem with the manufacturing process\". Other information was commercially confidential. </p> <p>The Royal College of GPs said it was confident there would be enough vaccine for the winter but advised healthcare professionals to concentrate on the most at-risk patients if there were delays. </p> <p>Chiron is the second major pharmaceutical company to hit problems in a week. Last week Merck's shares were hit by its voluntary withdrawal of its arthritis drug Vioxx because of the increased risk to patients of heart attacks and strokes.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Work in progress</strong> <br> The life stories presented in your article (The long march, September 29) bear testimony to the fact that the struggle for lesbian and gay equality suffers setbacks. It is not a historically linear process but the current trend is, overall, progressive. Legislative and social changes have improved the lot of the lesbian and gay community, but homophobic discrimination, if not outright queer bashing, remains rife. </p> <p>Many employers are increasingly recognising the importance of diversity issues within the workplace and this is to be welcomed, but much more could be done. The concentration of gays and lesbians in particular geographic localities, such as London, Brighton and Manchester, masks the fact that the majority live outside those areas. The business community throughout the UK could do more to cater to the needs of lesbians and gays. Important lessons are to be learned about social, community and economic regeneration from areas that are notoriously queer. A diverse society is a rich society. <br> <strong>Dr Brian Jones</strong><br> York </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> It was saddening to read the account from the teacher in your excellent feature on lesbian and gay lives at work. Saddening, but all too familiar. Despite some change both in public attitude and legal framework, schools remain very unsafe places for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) staff and students. Schools Out, the support group for LGBT workers in education and campaign for schools with an inclusive culture and curriculum, celebrates its 30th birthday this year. It has worked these long years to enable teachers and students to be out and proud in the classroom, thereby exposing and exploding the stereotypes of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transpeople. The effect of section 28 on schools was that for 15 years, few did anything to educate about the issue or challenge the homophobia that grew out of the prevailing ignorance. </p> <p>Schools Out has model policies, lesson plans and further suggestions as to how these issues should be tackled at <a href=\"http://www.schools-out.org.uk It\">www.schools-out.org.uk </a> </p> <p>It is crucial that schools are safe places for everyone and that we educate the school community to respect and celebrate its diversity.

Associations are investing \u00a350bn in communities. But we recognise that this is not enough. </p> <p>The chief reasons development costs have dramatically increased are the 58% industry-standard increase in labour and material costs over the past seven years, and the shortage and high price of available land. </p> <p>Housing associations welcome the principle of Prescott's recent proposal to use surplus public land for housing. This comes not before time. The sector has been advocating this policy for years. And Prescott could go further by allowing housing associations to hold land for future use and award associations a lead role in large-scale projects. </p> <p>It is not just about building as many houses as possible as fast as possible - it's about creating sustainable mixed communities. The housing association sector is up for delivery, and the government needs to remove the obstacles to achieving this aim. <br> <strong>Danny Friedman</strong> <br> Director of policy, National Housing Federation </p> <p><strong>Act now</strong><br> I take a different view from that of Sheila Aldworth (Letters, September 29). Yes, the underground transport system in London is older than any in San Francisco. However, doing nothing is an excuse not a valid reason. The Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) was passed back in 1995. Why does it take a law to make people do what is right rather than do it because it is right? </p> <p>My daughter lived in the US. She obtained a CD-rom of the Americans with Disability Act (ADA). It was delivered in a package marked Department of Justice, civil rights division.

  "<p>She is \"everything you want from a local government officer. Give her a target and she achieves it,\" says David Broughton, head of education and information management at Cambridgeshire county council who nominated Nikki Piper for the Guardian Public Servant of the Year award for her work in setting up the Ask Cedric consumer website. </p> <p>Ask Cedric, which stands for Consumer Education Resources and Information Centre, is an attractive, easily navigated interactive website (<a href=\"http://www.askcedric.org.uk)\">www.askcedric.org.uk)</a> that gives information about consumer rights and the law to businesses, the community and educational institutions. </p> <p>Piper read law at university, but a talk by a trading standards officer in her last year at university enthused her and, before she had even finished her degree, she landed a job in trading standards in Bexley, south-east London. She moved to Cambridgeshire five years ago with a brief to educate schools and the community about consumer rights. </p> <p>However, Piper, 32, realised that because consumer rights covers such a huge field she and other officers would often generate material that then remained unused for months. She tried to get funding to run a regional version of Cedric for schools so the material was not wasted but was turned down for funding. </p> <p>Undeterred, Piper came up with a template for Cedric to go nationwide. \"I knew it was a good idea, I knew it was needed, so I decided to carry on pursuing funding from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).\" Piper was so committed that she travelled up to Manchester to buttonhole a key senior civil servant and argue her case. \"I physically put my proposal in his hands.\" </p> <p>Within a fortnight she had been invited to London to discuss it. Two years ago, the DTI agreed to fund the website, and in 2002 it was launched as an educational tool for schools ,<strong> </strong> and in June the community part went live. </p> <p> There are many consumer groups that produce good information for the wider community and teachers but Piper found that teachers were put off by the range of material they were given. So Piper and her team tried to change the way they worked. \"We tried to stop seeing things from a trading standards point of view. We tried to see our work from an educational viewpoint instead. So we mapped the information we had across the national curriculum with different information for different Key Stages.\" </p> <p>Flushed from the success of the educational elements of the website, the team started to create the business section. \"There is a lot of bureaucracy out there for businesses when they are set up. We can't get round to every new business so instead we developed training modules that could be pulled off the website. It allows us to get on with other work and visit those who need us most,\" Broughton explains. </p> <p>It is the business section that is the most interactive at present. \"You type in your business sector, say a pub with accommodation, and the site will tell you with which parts of the law you need to comply,\" says Piper. \"We want to make it even more interactive to give businesses really specific information and we want to step up our work with trade associations so they can promote Cedric more widely.\" </p> <p>While Cambridgeshire county council maintains control of the free site, it has developed links with key partners including the Financial Services Authority, Citizens Advice, and the National Consumer Council. John Lawrence, head of trading standards at Cambridgeshire county council, believes that without Piper those organisations would not have come on board so quickly. \"Nikki exudes enthusiasm and makes people around her feel committed to projects. When you are working with outside organisations you need someone like Nikki who can infect others with that kind of enthusiasm.\" </p> <p>This year the community element to the website went live offering information on such subjects as scams, homeworking and doorstep selling. The team is currently generating materials about counterfeiting. </p> <p>Piper says: \"The other team members laugh and say Cedric is my child. But it is, really. I want to carry on with it, I would hate to give up Cedric.\" Broughton sees Piper as \"a real high flyer. She will go far. She's put in an awful lot of hours because of her dedication to the project.\" </p> <p>The schools section of the website has won an educational award and Cedric won a Trading Standards Institute for Excellence medal last year. Despite that, Cambridgeshire has to bid for funding to keep the website year on year from the DTI. </p> <p>Lawrence says the feedback from other organisations, including local authorities and central government has been fantastic. \"Cedric obviously met a need that was out there and was unmet. It is a really great initiative and it is a great honour for Nikki and the whole team to be nominated for this award.\"</p>",
  "It may have been Michael Howard's big speech, but the man who towers over this conference is not here. Tony Blair is on all lips, his name is hissed out in every speech, obsessively loathed just as Mrs Thatcher used to be at Labour conferences long ago. <p>It's a shame the Labour party is not here to glory at what it has done to the Tories. It is Tony Blair's cunning strategy (and Gordon Brown's prudence and David Blunkett's toughness on crime) that has reduced this once unassailable party to a puddle of uncertainty, punctuated with tribal war cries. </p> <p>When Liam Fox tried to emulate that famous killer-riposte with a resounding, \"Tony Blair, you are not Margaret Thatcher!\", it fell flat. Not because he is Maggie, but because he does bestride the political horizon as she did. Like her, he has been blessed in his opposition. Like her, he is not popular: she was always far more hated than loved; more voted against than for. But like her, he has the golden winning ticket - people still regard him as the most competent to govern. Again, like her he is not immortal or indefinitely secure in his post and his greatest error may trip him up yet. But sitting here in the Bournemouth conference hall is a salutary reminder of how completely Labour dominates the political scene. </p> <p>How did Labour do it? They did things only a few Tories gingerly start to perceive. When Labour was dominated by a rabble of Bennite unelectables, it had to rid itself of those supporters and face down its own conference, not pander to it. Read Giles Radice's just-published Diaries 1980-2001 for an excellent day-by-day account of what it took. Tories should read it to learn how ruthless the long road back from wilderness to centre ground must be. Labour waverers should read it to remind themselves of what New Labour forged, why it still triumphs - and how easily it might slide back to factionalism and fantasy politics. </p> <p>Michael Howard is deluged with advice from back-seat drivers. Turn right! Turn left! Take the \"common sense\" road, or head down into \"core vote\" valley. They are more lost than Labour was, since Labour had only one road to travel, with no threat on the left, while the Tories' vulnerable seats are attacked on both flanks. Should Howard head off Ukip as the right urge, or turn to face what wiser heads warn is by far the greater Lib Dem threat? He can't do both at once, yet much zig-zagging is going on here. </p> <p>In the end, Howard ploughed firmly to the right, while promising new honesty to heal the distrust caused by Blair. But as he drove his party further Eurosceptic than ever before, his promise to pull out of some EU treaties is as dishonest as it is impossible to deliver. People might spot a certain dishonesty, too, in his lachrymose gratitude to Britain for saving him from the gas chambers in the same breath as his pledge to pull out of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention. </p> <p>Otherwise, it was a speech that prided itself on the modesty of its promises. His five key points were good Tory stuff - school discipline, clean hospitals, more police, lower taxes, and less immigration - things of genuine popular concern. So why doesn't it fly? One of the sensibles in the shadow cabinet told me they still had to earn the right to be trusted before people would absorb these good old Tory themes. Only once firmly back in the land of ordinary people will voters warm to them again on law and order, taxes and immigration. Labour did not claw its way back by harping on about poverty, but by getting serious on crime and spending. </p> <p>So what would it take for the Tories to prove themselves back in the human race? First, a heartfelt embrace of the welfare state forever, no more yearning for new ways to subsidise private medicine or schools - both errors they made again yesterday. A convincing Tory cabinet would themselves use state schools and the NHS like ordinary people: they forget that under 10% use the private sector and that half the population earns less than \u00a322,000 for a full week's work. And they need some at least plausible plan for helping the poorest 20%. To be be lieved on these things, they need to pledge no tax cuts, just as Labour pledged no tax rises. They might even revisit Edward Heath's old phrase and promise action on \"the unacceptable face of capitalism\", the unwarranted fat-cat pay in the City. </p> <p>But why would anyone vote for \"a spineless photocopy\" of Labour, as young Tim Collins put it in his very old-Tory rant? Because all governments make errors and expire: Labour already shows signs of ageing. Because however much the Tories transform themselves into New Conservatives, everyone will always know they are the toughest on crime, immigration and tax. </p> <p>To all those on the left who think Tony Blair is a Tory, I wish you had been here to see the real thing. Note that Michael Howard made no mention whatever of poverty. Compare that to Labour's child-poverty pledge. He said nothing on childcare, nothing to woo back women voters. The whole array of policies on offer from the platform is strangely thin, with the feel of ideology devised in Central Office, lacking the substantial hard work Labour did to prepare for power. Labour is open to attack on various faltering policies, but the Tories do anecdotes, not killer research. </p> <p>But when this party is eventually re-elected - and they will be back when they have done some of the above - it will show how far Labour has pushed the centre ground leftwards since Mrs Thatcher's day. Something else Labour's left might learn here: Blair's snatching of \"choice\" really has dished the Tories' best line. Conservatives' \"choice\" is money taken out of public funds for the better-off to spend elsewhere: it only highlights Labour determination to make services more responsive to everyone within the welfare state. The \"choice\" coup is just another example of how the Tories did not jump down into these depths all by themselves: they were also pushed by Labour, which still holds them down there. </p> <p>Ahead is a long climb back out, but few Tories seem to know what a ladder looks like. Bringing back John Redwood to see off Ukip was just more digging. His bellowed anti-Europe diatribes breathe the monomania that still sets the conference afire. What else gets them whooping? Hunting, speed cameras, inheritance tax and wind farms. At a law-and-order fringe the Tory heartland voices that rose to rant were distinctly peculiar, a bit swivel-eyed as they raged that prisons are like hotels and yobs are mollycoddled by social workers. </p> <p>Those are the people the Tories now have to shock to the marrow. Despite well-trained, sane-looking young candidates on show, much of the rabble roused here still looks as untypical of Middle England as the air-punching Trots of Labour's bad old days. Labour's hall these days is full of normal-looking types, but the Tory fightback to normality has barely begun.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The following are extracts from Michael Howard's keynote address yesterday to the Conservative conference in Bournemouth: <p>Politicians, all politicians, have made promises they have failed to keep. In 1992 we promised to cut taxes year on year. But we put them up. </p> <p>In 1997 Labour said there would be no tax increases at all. They put them up... Let's face facts. What has happened on tax and on Europe has damaged people's faith in politics. So it's hardly surprising that people don't trust politicians today. </p> <p>In the real world, if you say you're going to do something, you do it. And if you screw up, you can lose your job. It's called accountability... What we start, we will follow through. And we will give people clear measures against which we can be judged. </p> <p>That's why we're setting out a clear Timetable for Action: what we'll do, when we'll do it. It will put us on the line in a way that no government has ever been before... I'll choose my cabinet because I expect them to deliver. And if they don't, I'll replace them with people who will. </p> <p>While we've let responsibility decline, we've allowed \"rights\" to proliferate. You hear it all the time, \"I've got my rights\". The verbal equivalent of two fingers to authority. The Human Rights Act has tipped the balance of justice away from the victim in favour of the troublemaker. </p> <p>That's why we're reviewing it. And if it can't be reformed, we'll get rid of it.</p> <p>Billions of pounds of taxpayers' money have been spent on the NHS. And what have we got to show for that? Bureaucrats, people waiting in pain for operations, dirty hospitals. More people die every year from hospital infections than are killed on Britain's roads. Two years ago my mother-in-law died from a hospital-acquired infection. Yes, she was old. Yes, she was frail. But she still enjoyed life. She need not have died. </p> <p>I want to be accountable on Europe too. On day one we will set the date for the referendum on the constitution. So if the election is next May, we will hold that referendum before we meet again next October. </p> <p>Europe isn't working properly today and the constitution will only make matters worse. The EU is spewing out too many regulations. It's holding our economy back. We cannot go on like this. It is a recipe for certain economic decline. We need a new approach to Europe.</p> <p>We have a proud tradition of giving refuge to people fleeing persecution, and welcoming families who want to settle here and work. We have a long tradition of firm but fair immigration controls. But today, immigration is chaotic and out of control. </p> <p>Four out of five failed asylum seekers are never removed from the country. And government officials have granted work permits which they knew to be fraudulent. All this rankles with people. They feel their tolerance and fairness are being abused.</p> <p>So... Michael Ancram will signal Britain's intention to pull out of the 1951 UN refugee convention... We want... genuine refugees to get to the front of the queue. </p> <p>The world is a better place without Saddam Hussein... In the run-up to the war, Tony Blair did not tell the truth. He did not give a truthful account of the intelligence he received. He did not behave as a British prime minister should. [He] has said that mistakes were made, [that] he accepts responsibility. But... it is a question of credibility.</p> <p>What if this prime minister asks people to trust him again? Could the British people trust him a second time?</p> <p>I owe everything I am to this country, I really do mean it. I owe my life to it. My father told me Britain was the best country in the world. I think it was and... still is. But I know we could be doing so much better. And it's because I think I can help make things better that I am standing before you today... I'm here so I can give back to Britain a tiny fraction of what Britain has given to me.</p>",

  "<p>Who says physics is difficult?

  "Peter Preston gets it partly right (Be sure to watch your own back, October 4). Labour climbed back from the abyss not just because party leaders enacted reforms, but because local parties made enormous steps by winning control of local councils. With this shift also came the embedding of socially egalitarian views in terms of race, gender, sexuality etc. And the shift in culture of the parliamentary Labour party between 1977-97 should not be underestimated. <p>Among Michael Howard's problems is the fact that there has been no such self-generating shift in the Conservative party. He may not be a bigot, but when Theresa May said the Tories were \"nasty\", she was uttering a truth more profound than she perhaps knew. The brighter parliamentary Tories know this, but \"democratising\" Conservatism has inadvertently cost them their party's ability to shift ground. The fact that this tension is unresolved has also assisted Ukip's growth. More interesting than Conservatism's learning difficulties is the fact that Labour in 1997 and 2001 polled fewer votes than the Tories in 1992.<br><b> John Lock</b><br>London </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Michael Howard has painted himself into a corner with his latest wheeze (Howard: I will sack ministers who break promises, October 5).

  "The shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, announced plans to \"set Britain on the path to a lower tax economy\" at the Conservative party's annual conference in Bournemouth on Monday. He gave no specific pledges on tax cuts, but said there would be \"no more broken promises on tax\" under a Tory government. <p>The Tories \"say they will put more money into health, education, defence and law and order while cutting taxes. Incredible. What a trick,\" scoffed the <b>Daily Mirror</b>. Public services \"would again collapse in cost-cutting\" if the Conservatives won the next general election, it said. \"No one believes the Tories on anything,\" agreed the Scottish <b>Daily Record</b>. \"The NHS is not safe in their hands, as they proved time and again over 18 blighted years in office. Nor are schools, policing, jobs or railways.\" The Record took comfort in the belief that \"the Tories don't speak for - or to - ordinary people in this country. They have been reduced to little more than a debating society which lurches further and further to the right every day.\" </p> <p>Mr Letwin showed \"welcome passion when he made the moral case for lower taxation\", argued the <b>Sun</b>. But why were the Tories delaying specific tax cut commitments? \"At this rate, the election will be over - and lost - before the Tory manifesto is finished.\" </p> <p>The <b>Daily Telegraph</b> agreed Mr Letwin had only talked \"in the most general terms\" to buy himself time. He needed to focus on the real audience for tax cuts, it said: the \"sizeable section of the electorate, those earning between \u00a320,000 and \u00a340,000 who have been harshly treated\". The Tories needed \"a tax plan that is financially credible and provides real relief for overburdened working families\". The party must \"hold out the prospect of an alternative to an ever higher tax burden under Labour\", added the London <b>Evening Standard</b>, \"without falling into the trap of making promises that no one will believe\". </p> <p>However, the <b>Daily Mail</b> was sceptical that this \"low-key approach\" was \"enough to jolt life\" into the party. \"Surely it is not asking too much for the Tories to find the rhetoric and policies to connect\" with the \"significant section of the population\" who loathe New Labour, said the paper.</p>",
  "The Tory conference yesterday heard a bold and persuasive leadership speech. It was shortly before Michael Howard performed, and came from Tim Collins, the party's education spokesman, who seemed to be overcome with rage as he read out his rant against Labour. It is hard to rant while reading from a text, but Mr Collins managed it. The failings of the Labour government had, it seemed, driven him to the edge of his reason. Like a rabid dog, his spittle could have driven the whole hall mad. <p>It was not subtle. If Michael Heseltine could famously tickle the clitoris of the Conservative party, Mr Collins is the equivalent of the apocryphal Aussie, whose idea of foreplay is to jab his partner in the ribs, yelling \"you awake?\"</p> <p>You can always tell a leadership bid because the speaker strays from the ostensible topic. Mr Heseltine, whose entire political career was one long leadership bid, used to devote around a minute to the subject in hand before getting on to his rant. Similarly, Mr Collins soon got off education and on to the iniquities of Europe. </p> <p>He denounced \"blind obedience to European laws others ignore\". We must have the guts to tell Brussels: \"If the French won't obey your daft laws, nor will we!\" </p> <p>Friendship across national borders was all very well, but we must know that our \"first loyalty is to a country called Britain, and never, ever to a country called Europe!\" </p> <p>The conference shouted its delight. They had him marked down as, perhaps, the next leader but three, which should see him installed in around 2007.</p> <p>Michael Howard followed. Like Labour, the Tories decided to hold the grand climax of their conference on the second day. This was because they expected the Hartlepool byelection tomorrow, and were afraid that news of their fourth place might spoil the impact of the leader's speech. </p> <p>Mr Howard's was a perfectly decent, workmanlike speech, though his curious vowels are making a comeback. \"My message to you is simpill! We want to bring back powers from Brussils!\" On crime, \"the glevvs will come off\". He wanted people to be big, and the state to be small. \"Big pippull! We demand bigger pippull!\" That will be the Tories' battle-cry. </p> <p>The most effective part of the speech came when he spoke movingly and personally about how his mother-in-law died of a hospital superbug, and his grandmother was killed in one of Hitler's concentration camps. </p> <p>He told us that he had been born just two weeks after the tyrant had invaded Russia, and you could see half the audience thinking, \"We didn't realise he was so young.\" </p> <p>At this point he stepped out from behind his autocue, and moved forward on the podium, as if to say, \"This is me, this is from the heart, I don't need a script to say what I have to say\", an effect only slightly spoiled by another autocue at the front of the stage. The implication seemed to be, \"Vote Conservative and these two dear ladies will be restored to life\".</p> <p>I fled to Harry Ramsden's for lunch, washed down with a bottle of the Black Sheep Brewery's ale, Riggwelter. The label, decorated with an apparently dead ram, explained that \"when a sheep is on its back and can't get up without help, in Yorkshire dialect it is said to be 'riggwelted'.\"</p> <p>What a bargain: haddock, chips, mushy peas and a metaphor for the Tory party - all for under nine quid!</p>",
  "With Elgar's Nimrod echoing out around the conference hall, a rare event took place yesterday at the end of Michael Howard's speech. <p>For the first time in living memory Tory MPs from across the party were united as they gushed about their leader's conference speech. \"Michael touched all the right buttons, with red meat for the activists and sensible messages for the electorate,\" declared one shadow minister who has been highly sceptical of the leadership. </p> <p>With voters expressing cynicism about all political parties, Howard aides spent months crafting a vision in mild language in the hope that it would not be dismissed out of hand as unreal istic. Abandoning what one adviser called the \"Blair messianic stuff\" ran the risk that the speech would be greeted with yawns by MPs and commentators who would claim that Mr Howard lacked a vision for the future. </p> <p>Mr Howard believes he squared this circle by setting out his \"timetable for action\", which spells a modest set of pledges which would be met within days of taking office. </p> <p>Abandoning the prisoner early release scheme and doing away with police paperwork may not amount to the sort of vision that carried Margaret Thatcher into Downing Street. But one well placed Tory said: \"The key issue is trust and everything we offer has to be credible. If you add up our pledges they would also transform Britain within days of our taking office.\" </p> <p>To show that he means business, Mr Howard promised to sack any minister who fails to deliver. He told the conference: \"What people want from their politicians is accountability, responsibility and a little humility... So I won't pretend I can solve every problem, right every wrong or cure every ill.\" </p> <p>The newly humbled Mr Howard showed his modest approach by resisting pressure from the party's right to offer a clear pledge to cut taxes. He merely committed himself to putting Britain \"back on the path to lower taxes\" by cutting billions of pounds from government spending. In one of the speech's most carefully crafted sentences, he said: \"When I can, I will cut taxes.\" </p> <p>MPs on the right, who believed that a guarantee of tax cuts would transform the election campaign, accepted this qualified commitment. Where the right could have been disappointed on tax, the left and centre could have been disappointed as Mr Howard faced up to the most immediate threat to the Tories: the growing support for the UK Independence party. Mr Howard did not repeat his tactics of the summer when he was criticised for boosting Ukip's support by attacking the party in name. </p> <p>Instead, he attempted to reach out to disaffected Eurosceptic Tories by promising to repatriate powers back from Brussels and to hold a referendum on the EU constitution within months of an election victory. \"If you want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain, whatever party you're from, come and join us,\" he said.</p> <p>The most prominent moderate in the shadow cabinet signalled yesterday that Mr Howard's attempt to reach out to the right - most notably, his pledge to tackle the \"chaotic and out of control\" immigration system - should go no further. \"A party is only ready for government when it addresses the concerns of all voters and not just those of its own supporters,\" said Tim Yeo in remarks aimed at the grassroots.</p> <p>As they filed out of the conference hall, one shadow minister summed up the cautious mood: \"If we get a good run on the telly and we get a bounce then maybe we'll turn the tide. If not, then it's the Charge of the Light Brigade for us.\"</p>",
  "Tony Blair's declaration that he intends to serve another full term accentuates the constitutional crisis now building in Britain - the growing belief that all the normal checks and balances have broken down and the country's leadership seems unaccountable and uncontrollable. <p>There are several factors feeding this despair: massaged intelligence; decision-making confined to a tiny non-elected coterie around the prime minister; and neither parliament nor the electorate able to secure a change in policy. Although discussion may take place on public platforms and in some of the media, the government shows no sign of listening. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, this has generated great frustration and anger, but it has not had any decisive effect because all the constraining elements in the power structure have been stymied. Parliament is hamstrung by the government's huge majority, enforced by a mixture of patronage and rigid discipline. No objection was raised even when the sole debate on the crisis in Iraq since the so-called end of the war was staged by the government without a substantive motion, and therefore with no vote at the end. </p> <p>Pressures from within the Labour party have been deflected because the national executive committee, the parliamentary party, the trade unions and the annual conference have all either had their composition weakened or their role largely marginalised. Even a leadership challenge is problematic under internal Labour rules. Not only is a challenger required to obtain the openly declared signatures of a fifth (83) of Labour MPs, but consent to an election could still be withheld if half the delegates to party conference did not agree. </p> <p> We not only need a radical strengthening of parliament's holding the executive to account but also, even more important, new forms of direct democracy involving the electorate. </p> <p>In parliament, we need a fully elected second chamber - perhaps based on regional representation - in order to secure a more democratic determination of policy than a whipped programme handed down from above without genuine consultation. We need cabinet appointments to be ratified at a public hearing of the appropriate select committee before they can come into effect, so that the principle of joint accountability to both prime minister and parliament is established, with the option of recall by either where justified. </p> <p>We need the appointment of the chair and members of specialist committees of inquiry (such as Hutton and Butler), and their terms of reference, to require approval by the relevant select committee. And we need the members of these revamped committees to be elected - in quotas reflecting the balance between the parties in the Commons - by MPs of each party in a secret ballot. If introduced, these measures would greatly strengthen parliament in checking the centralisation of power in the executive. </p> <p>But the democratic deficit will not be met without wider reform. Turnout at elections is steadily declining because people feel that one vote every 4-5 years gives them no influence over major events - foundation hospitals, top-up fees, GM crops, war in Iraq, to name just some. </p> <p>Bills, instead of being hammered through parliament on a whipped vote, should be examined first by a Commons committee in televised sessions, with specialist witnesses. Interested electors could then offer online comments, to be fed into the parliamentary process. </p> <p>Even more important is to draw on best democratic experience from abroad. In Switzerland, for example, citizens have a right to call a referendum on any issue they like, so long as they gather enough signatures. Indeed, any new law brought before the Swiss parliament can be challenged by the voters before it is enacted. If 1% of the population sign up to a proposal within an 18-month period, it can be voted on by the public and, if passed, become law. This really is direct democracy in action.</p> <p>Suppose, more modestly, we were to require a 5% threshold: that would require nearly 2 million people to sign up - an exacting demand, but by no means a prohibitive one. It would radically transform our politics.</p> <p>Of course there is a risk, with inflammatory tabloid headlines, that law-making could be too influenced by emotions rather than reasoned judgments. But a delay before a referendum could be held would allow tempers to cool. What is needed is a public debate about the pros and cons of referendums, which would enable us to achieve a real element of direct democracy while minimising any unintended misuses. If we could get that balance, it would re-engage public involvement in the big decisions, make politics meaningful beyond one vote every five years and, as a last resort, hold government leaders to account when all else fails. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:massonm@parliament.uk\">Michael Meacher</a> is Labour MP for Oldham West and Royton; he was environment minister 1997-2003</p>",
  "The home secretary and parliament got it wrong in deciding they could lock up foreign nationals suspected of terrorism indefinitely without trial while allowing British terrorism suspects full legal protections, nine law lords were told yesterday. <p>David Pannick QC, intervening on behalf of the civil rights organisation Liberty in an appeal brought by nine detainees, urged the law lords to rule that the powers in the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 violated the European convention on human rights. </p> <p>Mr Pannick said: \"What this case comes down to is that in a time of national crisis there is always a substantial risk that the legislature will react by adopting measures which do not take into account the interests of unpopular minorities.\" </p> <p>It was the duty of the court to decide dispassionately whether the balance had been properly struck in allowing foreign suspects, but not British nationals, to be detained indefinitely, he said. </p> <p>He reminded the law lords -sitting as a panel of nine instead of the usual five - that they did not have the same responsibility for enforcing the law as the US supreme court. Contrary to some press reports, the home secretary, David Blunkett, would not be required to release the detainees if the law lords ruled against him.</p> <p>In ruling that indefinite detention for foreign nationals only was incompatible with the convention, the judges would be \"inviting parliament to think again\", said Mr Pannick. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett says the act is an immigration measure and justifiably limited to foreign nationals. But Mr Pannick said immigration law allowed foreigners to be detained only pending deportation. The hearing is expected to end tomorrow.</p>"
