  "<p>They may be unloved by UK institutions, but there is a market for dull but reliable companies in unfashionable industries, as this week's cash offer for concrete maker RMC (up 1p to 849.5p) has proved. </p> <p>Against that background City speculators were taking a second a look at GKN, the world leader in constant velocity joints. </p> <p>The company has been something of a poor performer this year, with its shares falling 21% as the City started to fret about a slowdown in the automotive industry and the impact of rising raw material costs. </p> <p>Its shares rallied 6.5p to 211.5p in heavy volume yesterday after German investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein upgraded its rating to add and said the company, with its market-leading positions and lowly valuation, looked vulnerable to a bid. </p> <p>Even without a takeover the fundamentals also look attractive. Dresdner notes that, following the sale of its stake in AgustaWestland, GKN will have net cash of \u00a3264m. Given that its dividend costs about \u00a386m a year, this means the company should be able to keep paying a dividend, the yield on which is currently 5.7%, until end-markets recover. </p> <p>In the wider market, leading shares closed higher for a second consecutive session, led by British Airways, up 6.5p to 212.75p, after the crude price eased slightly. The final scores showed the FTSE 100 index up 20.8 points at 4,588.1. Hedge fund manager Man Group failed to join the party after the company's joint house broker, CSFB, cut its earnings forecasts in the wake of a mixed trading statement. Man Group fell 90p to \u00a311.55 - a 52-week low. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 gained 29.1 points to 6262.8, while the FTSE Small Cap index climbed 8.4 points to 2551.5. Market turnover was again average with about 2.6bn shares changing hands. </p> <p>In the bond market, gilts rallied after Kate Barker, a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, indicated that interest rates could be close to their peak. The benchmark 10-year gilt closed around 101.340, yielding 4.828%. </p> <p>Back among the blue chips, Capita was one of the day's biggest risers. Its shares rose 8.5p to 328.5p as traders built positions ahead of today's investor day at which the support services company, which runs London's congestion charging system, is expected to update the City on the performance of its life assurance and pension operations. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the slight pullback in the oil price helped paintmaker ICI, up 6.5p to 214.5p, but did no favours for BP, which eased 7p to 532p. BP was also affected by investors selling stock to buy into the jumbo Total share placing. Yesterday, French state-owned utility company EDF sold its 2.3% holding in Total. </p> <p>Other stocks to finish in the red included Northern Rock, down 15p to 719.5p as it traded ex-dividend, and AstraZeneca, which fell 23p to \u00a378 after Goldman Sachs told clients that next week's business day was unlikely to provide any positive surprises. </p> <p>Lower down the market, it was a case of another day, another rumour in construction group Amec. Its shares gained 10.5p to 315.5p on the back of rumours that support services company Serco, steady at 215p, had approached the firm with a merger proposal. </p> <p>On a more fundamental tack, Virgin Mobile, 12p lighter at 182.5p, fell further below this summer's 200p flotation price as institutions continued to digest Tuesday's disappointing trading update, which many analysts inter preted as warning on future revenues. </p> <p>Elsewhere in the telecoms sector, Thus rallied 0.75p to 14.5p after Columbia Venture Corporation announced a 5.23% holding. </p> <p>Stake building was also evident at housebuilder Crest Nicholson, which added 2.75p to 355.75p after Heron International, the property company of entrepreneur Gerald Ronson, announced the acquisition of 1.4m shares. Mr Ronson now owns 20% of Crest Nicholson and dealers reckon it is only a matter of time before a bid emerges for the company. </p> <p>Woolworths closed unchanged at 43.45p despite non-executive director Andrew Beeson declaring the purchase of 100,000 shares at 42p. </p> <p>Among the small caps, reinsurance company Goshawk, 4.25p higher at 44.75p, was the main talking point as rumours of a nil-premium merger went round. According to traders,legendary hedge fund manager George Soros is the driving force behind the deal that will see Goshawk join forces with two other reinsurers. </p> <p>Jarvis, the construction group which parted company with its chief executive on Tuesday, jumped 3.5p to 34.75p after activist investment company JO Hambro declared the purchase of just over 300,000 shares, taking its holding to 4%. </p> <p>Finally, Catalyst Media Group leapt 2p, or 23.5%, to 10.5p as supporters of value investor Paul Curtis piled in and in doing so managed to clear a large stock overhang. On top of that traders believe the company has ruled out a deeply discounted equity issue to fund the purchase of a 20% stake in Satellite Information Services, which provides bookmakers with live TV pictures, and that a big deal with a leading media company is also in the pipeline.</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Wayne Rooney's staggering impact at Old Trafford is that the last time a Manchester United player scored a hat-trick on his debut, Norway were in the process of getting independence from Sweden and Albert Einstein was putting the finishing touches to the Special Theory of Relativity. As for the self-proclaimed biggest club in the world, they were languishing in the old Second Division and based in Bank Street in Manchester's factory district - a venue so flimsy it eventually blew down. </p> <p>One suspects the curator of the Old Trafford museum might have to start creating some new space. Whereas Charlie Sagar's hat-trick against Bristol City in 1905 has been consigned to the small print in the club's annals, the most logical conclusion from Rooney's three goals against Fenerbahce on Tuesday is that the 18-year-old is not only destined to join George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton in the pantheon of United greats but might actually outdo them all in the process. </p> <p>That is precisely the sort of statement, of course, guaranteed to to make Sir Alex Ferguson go purple. The manager's own sense of exhilaration was tempered only by the inevitable media barrage that followed. Ferguson was almost gruff as he tried, and failed, to deflect the attention from his \u00a327m signing, but elsewhere at Old Trafford there was not only the sight of Sven-Goran Eriksson jumping out of his seat in excitement - most un-Svenlike - but of United's directors slapping each other on the back. </p> <p>Wilf McGuinness, Sir Matt Busby's successor as United manager, was among the 67,000-plus privileged spectators and the one-time Busby Babe could be seen afterwards, shaking his head in disbelief, as he went through Rooney's performance with Paddy Crerand, a member of the 1968 European Cup-winning side. </p> <p>\"I found myself laughing out loud because it was like watching a fairy tale,\" the 66-year-old McGuinness said yesterday. \"I've worked with some great players in my time and this boy can be up there with the best of them.\" </p> <p>McGuinness draws comparisons between Rooney and Duncan Edwards - \"two ordinary lads with extraordinary talent\" - and believes United's opponents will soon base their strategy around nullifying the teenager. Whether it is possible to contain him, however, he is not sure. </p> <p>\"I think we are going to see a lot more man-marking from now on. The thing is, though, that we've already seen that in the past for Everton and England, and it hasn't worked,\" he said. </p> <p>\"My first instinct would be to make it as difficult as possible by putting a player on him. But if you go tight on him he doesn't seem to mind. He can lose you with a drop of his shoulder and he's gone. His first two goals were both power shooting and the third showed he can place the ball wherever he wants. So what do you do about that?\" </p> <p>The natural inclination is to draw comparisons with strikers of the past. Even then, it is difficult to find anyone in Rooney's mould. True, Jimmy Greaves scored 22 goals in his first season as a 17-year-old with Chelsea, but he was a penalty-box predator rather than the explosive, all-round attacker at Ferguson's disposal. </p> <p>The nearest there has been to Rooney is probably Trevor Francis, who as a 16-year-old for Birmingham scored 15 goals in his first 15 games, including four one afternoon against Bolton. </p> <p>Francis, dubbed \"Superboy\" and \"St Francis of St Andrews\", has revealing insights into the tricks that defenders will use against the youthful Rooney. </p> <p>\"My marker talked to me through the entire game,\" he once said of his Birmingham debut. \"He was saying things like: 'Are you all right, son? Not too tired? I know what an ordeal it is, but there's only half an hour to go, lad, then you can go upstairs for a drink. Tell you what, I'll buy you one myself.\" </p> <p>Rooney is too streetwise, too mean and too good to allow that form of old-fashioned gamesmanship to bother him. And the days are long gone when every team had its regulation hatchet-man to sort out the opposition's best player. </p> <p>But Francis also has stories of how fame at such a young age has a cost.\"There was one time I was sitting in a pub, drinking a lemon and lime, and some City supporters were chatting to me, friendly like, when somebody in the background spat all over my face. I just had to sit there and take it. What would it have looked like if I'd got involved in a fight?\" </p> <p>Would Rooney be able to \"sit there and take it\"? Recent evidence suggests he has yet to acclimatise to stardom off the field, but in Ferguson he has a manager with expertise in helping young players develop. Just as Ryan Giggs was shielded from the press in his formative years, it might be two years before Rooney is allowed to speak to the newspapers. Similarly, Rooney will quickly learn that United's manager has a network of contacts throughout the north-west to keep him abreast of his players' movements out of working hours. \"Manchester is a village\" is the saying in United's dressing room. </p> <p>Rooney's odds on finishing as the Champions League top scorer were slashed to 9-2 last night, having once been 12-1, and the most exciting part for United is that he might not peak for another four years. </p> <p>\"It's hard to put into words,\" said Rio Ferdinand. \"He's done it in the European Championship with England and now in the Champions League with Manchester United. Honestly, I don't think he knows the word 'pressure' - it can't be in his vocabulary.\"</p>",
  "\"But what about the child, the decision ignores him? That's nonsense, it cannot be right. You must go to the House of Lords, and you must argue this - and this ... \" <p>A typical response by Allan Levy QC (obituary, September 29) to a case that had gone wrong so far. First, real concern about the plight of the child. This was central to his approach in every case he argued, to every broadcast, to every article and every campaign he joined. Second, measured indignation at an injustice. Third, practical help with what to do and a reliable gut reaction as to which cases would actually be heard and won in the House of Lords or in Europe. From this initial advice, there would follow painstaking days of discussion on the details of the case and rehearsal of the arguments. </p> <p>However serious the issues, on a personal note Allan's endearing sense of humour and willingness to tease and be teased always broke through. Instinctively, however, the focus always came back to what was necessary to protect the child. Allan's encyclopaedic knowledge of childcare law together with an unadorned advocacy style left no room for doubt as to the issues in a case that really mattered. A fearless sense of what was right and a genuine belief that what was right would ultimately be recognised and adopted by the courts characterised Allan's unique contribution to the law and to the rights of the child. </p> <p>Allan died very much in the thick of it, with the JD v East Berkshire Community NHS Trust case about to be heard in the House of Lords, his foreword to a comparative law book on child abuse claims just published and many other outstanding projects. He was instrumental in making children's work a specialist area in the law. </p> <p>Allan Levy should be recognised and remembered for his success in significantly raising public awareness of childcare issues and for his persistence in fighting battles on behalf of children through the courts in England and Strasbourg.</p>",

  "<b>Independent</b> <br>Editorial, September 27 <p>\"The killing by Israel of a senior Hamas member on Syrian soil shows that Ariel Sharon's government is taking its assassination campaign to new lengths.

  "Thailand yesterday announced the first probable case of human-to-human bird flu transmission but insisted it had occurred in unique circumstances and there was no need for the public to panic. <p>The much-feared development in the outbreak, which has been ravaging poultry in east Asia for 10 months and has killed at least 28 people, came a day after both the UN's food and agriculture organisation and the World Organisation for Animal Health warned bird flu in Asia had become \"a crisis of global importance\". </p> <p>Charal Trinwuthipong of Thailand's disease control department said Pranee Thongchan, 26, had died of the deadly H5N1 virus but had not come into contact with infected chickens.

Sakuntala was cremated before the final tests confirming her cause of death were conducted. </p> <p>Dr Kumara Rai, the head of the World Health Organisation in Thailand, played down the risk of an epidemic spreading through humans. He said the transmission had only occurred after \"very close, direct, face-to-face and long contact\".

Which is convenient, what with tonight's Big Cup games being preceded by a rant from everyone's favourite panto star, and president of Fifa, Sepp Blatter.

And before anyone could say 'Hang on Fiver, that panto analogy falls down a bit ther...\"</p> <p>... our fevered mind had turned to one of those ugly sisters in Big Cup action tonight, Arsenal, and their grand dame Arsene Wenger. \"We have [trounced all comers in the Premiership], so people want more, and more means the [Big Cup] as well,\" he insisted, deflecting the usual questions about his side displaying more choke in Europe than a Land Rover in Lapland. \"We will try, but football is not self-service where you put a coin in there and you get a bar of chocolate.\" Which is just as well, when you think about it.</p> <p>The Fiver can't help feeling that if Jose Mourinho was a bar of chocolate, he'd have licked himself into a sticky sort of oblivion by now.

  "<p>The health secretary, John Reid, today told the Labour party conference he was going to revolutionise the NHS.</p> <p>He said a decentralised health service would empower local people to shape the way services were delivered, and also give everyone choices over where they were treated.</p> <p>He said he wanted to cut the level of central control over the NHS from 80% down to 20%, as each area decides how it wants healthcare to be offered. The standards will be set nationally, but there will plenty of scope for people to determine the priorities in their locality.</p> <p>Mr Reid promised he would drive this agenda to ensure Whitehall control is watered down, while ensuring the basic principle the NHS was built upon is maintained - it will be free at the point of delivery to everyone. </p> <p>Foundation status for health trusts helped to empower patients, he said, by helping local areas take on more control of their hospitals.</p> <p>\"They [working people] have never had the degree of choice that the well connected can have,\" he told a fringe meeting organised by watchdog the Healthcare Commission. </p> <p>\"There has been a two-tier system in this country for 60 years. Well connected people could find out where the best hospitals were, and we want everyone to be able to do that,\" he said.</p> <p>He said the NHS is inequitable in many ways, but that not everyone had access to excellence in health services, and he wanted that to change.</p> <p>Reform of this kind in such a large organisation, employing 1.3 million people, had never been achieved before, he said. Only the Chinese army and the Indian railway employs more people and neither of those had attempted to such radical changes, he said.</p>",
  "<p>Three Gypsies today claimed an important human rights victory after a court of appeal ruling put more pressure on councils to find sites for Travellers' mobile homes. </p> <p>The Gypsies overturned a high court ruling that blocked permission for their families to live on land in Chichester, West Sussex. </p> <p>High court judge Mr Justice Blackburne had overruled a government planning inspector's decision that planning permission should be granted on human rights grounds.</p> <p>Although the Gypsy families had originally gone on the land without permission, the inspector took into account that Chichester district council had failed to provide sites in its area for Gypsies and other travelling people in line with government guidance. </p> <p>The high court ruled that the inspector had erred when applying human rights law. But today, in a 2 to 1 majority decision, the court of appeal backed the inspector's judgement and reinstated his decision. </p> <p>Lord Justice Wall and Mr Justice Pumfrey backed the appeal. Lord Justice Auld disagreed with them on the human rights issue, but said the appeal should be allowed on other planning grounds. </p> <p>Lord Justice Wall said the inspector had found the council had breached government guidance on help being given to gypsies, and the consequence was \"that there was little credible prospect of any private Gypsy site being permitted by the council.\"</p> <p>At stake was the right of the families \"to respect for the homes which they had created - homes admittedly created in breach of planning laws,\" said the judge.</p> <p>The decision to serve enforcement notices on the families to get them off the land interfered with those rights, which were protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. </p> <p>The inspector was entitled to find that, against the background of a lack of sites, such interference was not \"justified or proportionate\".</p> <p>Mr Justice Pumfrey agreed, saying the inspector was entitled to balance the shortage of sites against the \"planning harm\" to the environment of granting permission. </p> <p>The inspector had found the site was in \"ordinary countryside\" not subject to any special designation, had no recognised nature conservation value, or archaeological or declared historical value. </p> <p>The judge referred to a 1994 government circular giving guidance on Gypsy sites and planning. The circular was issued following the repeal of the 1968 Caravan Sites Act, part II - which had obliged county councils to provide caravan pitches. </p> <p>The new guidance encouraged Gypsies to secure their own sites, making use of the planning process when necessary. </p> <p>Mr Justice Pumfrey said that the circular stated that the land-use requirements of Gypsies \"need to be met\", and also pointed out that the repeal of the statutory duty on county councils to provide sites \"will make it all the more important that local planning authorities make adequate Gypsy site provision in their development plans.\"</p> <p>The landmark ruling was won by Grant Doe, Gregory Yates and Paul Eames and their families, who all moved on to land in West Ashling in December 2001.</p> <p>Their subsequent applications for planning permission were rejected by the district council and enforcement notices issued requiring the residential use of the site to cease.</p> <p>Mr Yates, spokesman for the Gypsies and owner of the land, said later: \"This is an important case for all Gypsies because it will affect many other cases in the future. Councils must take note of the guidelines, and it is important that they identity sites in their areas to be developed.\"</p>",
  "<p>I hate children. I hate animals too, but I thought admitting the former would bring me fewer death threats. Plus, animals are relatively easily avoided if you live in London and remember to check people for cat hair and Pedigree Chum smears before you make friends with them. </p> <p>Children, on the other hand, have been the bane of my life ever since I first turned up at primary school and found myself surrounded by the little buggers. And as American writer Florence King so rightly points out in her autobiography, Confessions of a Failed Southern Lady, \"The worst thing was, it appeared that I was one of them. I hadn't known that before. I thought I was just short.\" </p> <p>She was lucky. I was short as well, which left me prey to enormous older girls with ra-ra skirts and nascent maternal longings who would pick me up and cart me round the playground long after I had volubly expressed my lack of zeal for this proceeding (\"I'm going to kill you. And all your pets\"). I didn't much like boys either, but at least their investigations into the vexed question of how far one can throw a midget across Tarmac had a dispassionate, scientific aspect about them that I admired. The answer, for those of you unable to avail yourselves of an 18th-century travelling freak show to conduct your own scientific enquiry, is about three yards, the length of a hopscotch grid. It was also empirically proven that a protective Parka is aerodynamically unsound and should therefore be wrenched from the protesting midget's feeble grasp before the project is undertaken. </p> <p>I thought I'd be free of their malevolent ways by now, but in fact they're still having a decidedly negative effect on my quality of life. If they're not being rolled in bubble wrap and driven the 37 yards between their front door and school in a Sherman tank in front of my bus, they're disturbing my morning reverie with their lively demonstrations of ringtones, bullying and, in one memorable instance, self-piercing. </p> <p>As an additonal disturbance to my equilibrium, their juvenile sociopathy forces me, via the National Code of Dissatisfied English People (head-shaking, lip-pursing, the otherwise lost art of tut-tutting), into unwilling coalition with dead-eyed women wearing \"I love Jim Davidson\" badges and men who are are clearly on their way home to polish their Nazi memorabilia collections before a hard evening's masturbating over pictures of Princess Michael of Kent. </p> <p>Now my friends are having babies. The last one I visited gave me an unsolicited 20-minute peroration on pureed peas, while leaking from orifices I barely knew existed. And while I am grateful to another for my induction into a hitherto unsuspected world of cloacal knowledge, I fear this information will aid me little in my quest to make enough new friends to replace the ones crushed by infant tyrants. </p> <p>But kids aren't content with wreaking havoc on individual lives. They like to work on a broader canvas, too. For example, it is their inability to distinguish between a supersize Mars bar and a long and healthy life that is forcing the makers of such snacks to withdraw them from sale. Why are they letting themselves be dictated to in this way? Why are adults being denied the opportunity to eat their own bodyweight in one handy bar of pleasure if they so choose? A king-size Twix is not a toy. It's designed to get people through the kind of problems that only grown-ups suffer, such as divorce, redundancy, or the 18th series of Where the Heart Is. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Newsagents should simply be banned from selling the big stuff to the small fry. The hunt to find rogue traders willing to breach the regulations will fill the void left since selling cigarettes to minors became punishable by death rather than a gentle ticking-off from a kindly bobby as it was in my (admittedly emphysemic) youth, and no longer worth the 300% mark-up it occasioned. And all that scouting around will help the little blobs lose weight, too. Although we need to be careful - if they start slimming down and getting more energetic, they'll need somewhere to work it off and start asking what happened to all the playing fields. </p> <p>I know it's not all their fault, of course. Their unformed atavistic souls know no better, and if there are no parents around to peel their fat fingers off whatever fabulous confections of hydrogenated vegetable fat and sucrose take their fancy, then I suppose Mr Cadbury et al have to do it for them. And now, if you will excuse me, I have some memorabilia to polish.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine a perfect world in which your favourite armchair is your workplace, the laptop computer is a step away, and in the next room is a fridge stocked with mouthwatering delicacies. There's no boss to watch you come and go, and in the late afternoon you contentedly put down your pen, walk down a flight or two of stairs, and settle into the featherbed embrace of your loving partner and family. </p> <p>It's called working from home. No ghastly commuting, no works canteen, no office politics, no pesky meetings, no tiresome interruptions from colleagues. And, of course, you're on hand for the kids when the time comes. A world where the work-life scales are perpetually balanced. Brilliant! </p> <p>There's just one problem. It doesn't exist. It's all make-believe. The world of working from home is a kind of la-la land for unwary home dads. Even with an au pair, an after-school helper, school hours, multitudes of labour-saving devices and people in to cook and clean, you will always end up at the mercy of the school run, the washing-up, the taxi service to the judo club, the window cleaners, the radiator repair man, the doctor ... </p> <p>However disciplined you try to be, you will never, ever get any proper work done. How many brave home-working mums and dads have packed in the day job, invested in a laptop and set off down this road, only to reach the same dismal conclusion? A friend of mine wrote a book about downshifting that makes it sound so heavenly. She didn't have kids. </p> <p>It all starts so well. You feel in control. You select the sunniest room at the top of the house, stack it with whatever kit you need for your calling, whether you are a writer, a consultant or a purveyor of double-glazing. So in go the desk, the computer, the fax and the telephone. And a kettle. Always a kettle. </p> <p>The comfy armchair and a few bookshelves are heaved into place. You put a lock on the door. Now for your child-care arrangements. How are you to prevent the little darlings from overrunning your new-found personal space? Simple - you hire an au pair to collect them from school, feed and water them, wash up and entertain them all afternoon until you are ready to come down from your eyrie, like a demigod descending from on high to claim ownership of the TV remote. </p> <p>Your first inkling that working from home is not going to be such a godlike experience arrives on the first morning, when you look in the kitchen to find that nobody washed up any of the breakfast things. Or the Sunday roast pan. Well, really! How is anyone expected to function in such squalor? Never mind, soon fixed - and you roll up your sleeves. </p> <p>For some months after that, you find yourself engaged in a lengthening series of displacement activities that occupy more and more of the day before you can get down to work - need I mention making the beds, clearing toys off the floor, putting CDs back in their cases, changing the cat litter, and rousting out the little black mouldy bits from between the tiles at the back of the bath? </p> <p>You will eventually come to your senses and, with a supreme effort, force yourself to ignore the household tasks and go straight to your home-office; though, when your partner comes home, they will get very upset at the state of the kitchen. But you do not hear: you have locked yourself away to focus. At least, you tell yourself, you have a cleaning lady. </p> <p>Ah, the cleaning lady. Ours comes every other Tuesday, and what a gem she is - charming, efficient, hard-working and thorough. Very thorough. Cleaning Tuesday is not a day to hang around the house, unless you enjoy the merry thrum of vacuuming, trip wires of electric flex on the stairs and being banned from treading on the kitchen floor at lunchtime. You can always get out to a cafe. Yes, better not to work at home on a Tuesday at all. </p> <p>After a while you will notice people taking you and your work room for granted. You lost the key long ago. That comfy armchair needs clearing of old sweet wrappings and copies of the Beano. Somebody has poured Lucozade down the phone and got a virus in the computer downloading music off the internet. \"But I work here,\" you mutter, to looks of pity and incredulity. </p> <p>You have peace in the mornings, when the children are at school. But the afternoons? It starts to get lively around half past three. When the children are tiny, there is the patter of small feet on the stairs and you are begged to view the latest finger painting; when they are large, there is an incredible thumping noise, the door flies open and you are loudly importuned for money and favours. \"Excuse me,\" you will say to your valued contact, cupping a hand over the telephone mouthpiece, \"something urgent has just come up.\" </p> <p>All the same, you will feel duty bound to drive your daughter to her four o'clock cello class (and then feel enormously guilty when she drops cello and takes up Street Fighter Kombat Zone on the PlayStation 2 instead). When you return, concentration in shreds, you will find your delightful au pair confidently in charge, quelling insurrections and cooking pasta. How does she do it? </p> <p>Eventually, when the kids are a certain age, you decide you can do without an au pair - after all, it can't be that difficult, making beans on toast, getting on with a bit of homework, plugging in Newsround and Blue Peter. You can do it yourself. That's when the trouble really starts. That's when you start seriously wondering: does this working from home really work? </p> <p>Personally I realised this was the case not long ago, when, having done without any help for six months, I totted up how much time I'd spent making and clearing up food and how much actually \"working\" in the other sense - and then finally reflecting on the cruel thought that it would make not a blind bit of difference to my kids if it was me in the kitchen or not. </p> <p>Right, that's it. Now I've signed up a squadron of after-school minders to collect, feed, sort out and clear up after the kids, while I leave the house at midday and go to a variety of secret locations to work. Not even my wife knows. And when I come back at seven I find everything done, so I can concentrate on the important things like switching TV channels, playing Monopoly and doing homework with my nine-year-old son. </p> <p>Now that's what I call balance. No more guilt, no more suppressed anger and frustration, far more self-respect, and I'll bet my children respect me for it too. Let's face it, working from home doesn't work. It's a professional Neverland. Get out more, that's what I say! </p> <p>So, I will.</p>",
  "<p>So, money can't buy you love. According to new research, families on low incomes have far healthier roots than those who earn more than \u00a360,000 a year. Children from poorer families live closer to their parents, speak more often on the phone and are more likely to give help regularly. The grandparents are also more likely to give a hand with childcare. Apparently, the ties that bind are much better when they don't come at a designer price. And yet ... </p> <p>The extended and close family unit, dependent on the quality of human contact rather than a limitless capacity for forking out another \u00a3100 for the latest trainers or toy fad, has to have its attractions in an increasingly atomised and disconnected society. Hence, perhaps, the enormous pulling power of HE Bates' Larkin family in The Darling Buds of May, when Ma and Pa Larkin and all the little and rather larger Larkins were transferred to the television screen, attracting huge ratings. But, in addition, we perhaps ought to remember that apron strings can also throttle the life out of an independent spirit, hold the doors of opportunity shut and keep some couples lassoed to damaging relationships which - but for the presence of three dozen members of both clans on the doorstep advocating \"give it time\" - would long ago have been ended to the benefit of both. </p> <p>The news that children of wealthier families are less likely to enjoy close relationships comes from Parent and Adult-Child Interactions, a report by John Ermisch of the Institute of Social and Economic Research. It is based on data gleaned from 5,000 households surveyed in the continuing British Household Panel, begun in 1991. </p> <p>The study looked at income, assets and value of property and ranged from incomes over \u00a360,000 to under \u00a317,000. What Ermisch has discovered is that while the upper classes have always believed in long-distance parenthood, shipping their offspring first to the nursery in the furthest wing of the manor house and then to boarding school, today's affluent middle classes, worker bees all, also now tend to lose touch with their young, this time by being present in their lives but also missing - distracted by careers, commuting and conspicuous consumption. </p> <p>In 1956, research into one working-class community in south London revealed that each person said they had between 37 and 246 relatives living close by. Another study in the 50s indicated that 75% of married men who were not householders, were living with their wives' parents. This wasn't just because of a housing problem, but also as the result of the closeness of the mother-daughter relationship (hence the flood of mother-in-law jokes). In the same decade, in Bethnal Green in east London, a mothers' union of mothers and daughters offered a mutual aid system. </p> <p>According to Ann Oakley, in Subject Women, more than half the married women in one sample had seen their mothers within the previous 24 hours, and 80% in the previous week. </p> <p>Now many women work, so the pattern of daily visiting has been disrupted. And a degree of economic independence coupled with social change has also allowed the luxury of introspection. Like mother, is no longer quite like daughter - and thence comes the friction. Women may be seeing less of their parents - but they may be well glad of it. Since the 60s, a steady stream of books has looked at the often highly fraught mother-daughter relationship as well as the price possibly paid if your parents didn't love you (or, at least, you believe your parents didn't love you). In Nancy Friday's 70s bestseller, My Mother My Self, for instance, she wrote, \"When a mother refuses to let her daughter grow up, she is retarding her own growth as well; in overlong symbiosis, both partners suffer.\" And sure as hell, so do the husband, father, boyfriend ... </p> <p>Poorer families may stick together, communicate often and give succour, but only those suffering from the Von Trapp syndrome would assume this always comes without pain and the suffocation of aspiration - particularly when the lack of money is a factor. As even a rudimentary glance at Trisha, ITV's morning dose of disfunctionality, often demonstrates, what is deemed \"help and support\" by one member of the tribe, is often viewed as domineering, overpowering and possessive interference by another. </p> <p>Of course, closeness is to be treasured - but perhaps on certain terms. If, for example, it also allows for separation and autonomy. If it permits one generation to negotiate about changing values and attitudes with another (for instance, in the different ways in which parents and grandparents approach childcare). And if it accepts the ultimate irony, that this anti-materialistic connectedness may feed a child with such self-confidence and optimism that she opts to \"better\" herself - and eventually moves up the social ladder and away from so much of what, at its best, is priceless.</p>",
  "<p>Aren Christopher Elliott is two years old and lives in Key Largo, Florida. His mother is called Kari Astrid Haugeto, and she describes herself as a \"vocalist, scuba-diving instructor and travel writer\". His dad, Christopher James Elliott, describes himself as a \"travel writer, scuba-diving instructor, and a pretty darned good pillow to sleep on\". Aren, who has fair hair and the cutest little smile, attends the Lutheran Haven Early Childhood Center. If you would like to see Aren for yourself, or if there is any other detail, no matter how small, that you would like to know about Aren, then feel free to log on to <a href=\"http://www.elliott.org/aren/\">www.elliott.org/aren/</a> and fill your boots. Aren is the subject of one of the world's first baby blogs, and pretty much every burp and fart of his life so far is documented for us all on the worldwide web. </p> <p>Baby blogging is fast becoming an international phenomenon. Most baby bloggers are American, but the briefest of web searches will lead you to kids of all nationalities. One I found yesterday opened with a picture of two-year-old Niall from Hertfordshire. Niall can't eat anything with cow's milk, and dislikes being told \"No\". I could go on ... </p> <p>Baby blogging may have begun as a way to keep distant family members in intimate touch with a new baby in the family - a round-robin letter of the modern age. But if you're posting something on the web, then it can be found by strangers, and that makes these blogs a different creature entirely. You will not be surprised to hear that it is not just family members who log on to these sites. Complete strangers often end up as keen fans of individual baby blogs - some of them do indeed have all the makings of a great cult blog - and a myriad web of links now stretches between baby blogs on different continents. </p> <p>The attraction of these blogs is fairly hard to fathom at first glance. Bloggingmommies gives links to about 850 kiddie blogs. A brief foray through them unearths a disturbing number of home-schoolers and pro-lifers saying things such as \"DS1 did such a cute thing today\". To get one handy tip on dealing with colicky babies, you have to plough through a lot of random outpourings. \"We left home this morning at 10.15 to participate in the annual Right-to-Life Walk-a-thon,\" blogs one mother.\"Lincoln and I didn't actually walk.\" Another begins: \"My knitting class was so much fun.\" Someone else offers up the lyrics, in full, to a Leonard Cohen song and one more mommy provides, in some detail, her daily dinner menus. </p> <p>But as you trawl, it becomes obvious that these parents - often stuck in the house with kids most of the time - are creating a virtual community for themselves. Clancy Ratliff, a student of rhetoric and feminist studies, is studying the weblogs of mothers for her doctoral dissertation at the University of Minnesota. \"People may think, 'Oh, this is just someone's blog about changing a diaper,' \" Ratliff told the Seattle Times last week, \"but these are women who are using blogs to have a voice in the public sphere ... it's a pretty powerful thing for a lot of women.\" </p> <p>And, it would seem, for a lot of men too. There's an interesting preponderance of dads in baby blog world, perhaps because blogging offers a way to pin down or catalogue the fluid, insane, contradictory world of childrearing. Log on to <a href=\"http://www.Trixieupdate.com\">Trixieupdate.com</a> kept by Ben MacNeill, a stay-at-home dad from North Carolina, and you'll find toddler Trixie's gaping mouth, with arrows pointing to the few teeth she now has, giving the name of each one (\"Excelsior\" \"Defiant\" \"Invincible\"). No doubt Trixie's mother is out there at work somewhere wishing MacNeill would get off the computer and clean out the fridge. Blogging may also be a way for disenfranchised dads to feel really involved. One dad - British this time - blogs his partner's pregnancy in meticulous detail - sometimes offering a couple of entries in one day. (Foetus-blogging is often a prelude to a baby blog, it turns out.) </p> <p>Naturally some bloggers are more interesting and articulate than others. William Mitchell, who is a Stanford University academic, and research director at a thinktank in Silicon Valley, says blogs are the new \"baby book\". </p> <p>While you would be unlikely to pick up pen and paper unless your child did a really stupendous thing, he says, it is easy to idly tap in a new cognitive milestone before you check your emails each morning. \"I have written far more in the kids' blog than I ever would have in the baby books,\" blogs Mitchell, \"The baby book was a place mainly to commemorate firsts - first words, first steps, first haircut. With the blog, in contrast, I write more about everyday stuff. It's social history, not a timeline.\" </p> <p>Whether or not our kids will ever avail themselves of this socio-historical resource is a moot point. \"By the time they are my age, my kids are likely to record just about every waking moment of their lives,\" writes Mitchell. \"At that point, recording an event won't be the notable thing: turning off the recorder, going off-the-record, choosing not to capture an event, will be the notable act.\" </p> <p>Of course, if this is the case, our kids won't have time to read their baby blogs. But if they do dip into them, they will surely gain the sort of insight into their childhood that could fuel years of therapy. </p> <p>But blogging is a dog-eat-dog world: while it may have your kids in therapy, it might well keep you out of it. From a parenting perspective just getting it all off your chest could be really helpful if you have spent the day with a tantrumy three-year-old. And getting replies from other, random parents across the globe all saying, \"Yes, my little Timmy is a demon too,\" could certainly make you feel less alone. </p> <p>But before you leap online, you may want to ask yourself whether your child will really thank you for his blog. In 20 years' time, when the little tyke who just killed the hamster is trying to get into the diplomatic corps, will he really want this information posted at the touch of a button? Or when your teenage daughter is getting ready for a hot date, will she really want her Googling boyfriend to know she wet the bed till she was 10? </p> <p>People have also questioned the wisdom of publishing internet pictures of your toddler in the bath. When family images go public, things can get complicated. Of course you can set up your blog so that only friends can access the picture (using a password) - but not many parents can be bothered with such security measures. The briefest Google will lead you to baby blogs plastered with naked toddlers romping in and out of the bath. </p> <p>Baby blogs are a curious thing - the bloggers combine altruism and community spirit with a strange, slightly blinkered self-absorption. But they certainly seem happy, and their numbers are growing. It's \"a way for [family] to be a part of our lives without actually being with us,\" writes one blogger.

  "<p>Free school meals for all primary school children could be rolled out across the country, the education secretary, Charles Clarke, hinted today.</p> <p>Mr Clarke said in a question and answer session at the Labour party conference that he would be watching \"very very carefully\" the results of a pioneering scheme introduced by Hull city council to give all primary school children free school meals in a bid to end the taboo of lunch vouchers and encourage healthy eating.</p> <p>Under the local authority scheme, pupils will be eligible for breakfast, lunch and an after school snack. </p> <p>At present only 26% of pupils are entitled to free school meals.</p> <p>Hull council hopes universal free school meals within the local authority catchment area will help raise educational attainment in the area, which is lagging at the bottom of the league tables in terms of the number of pupils who achieve good GCSEs.</p> <p>The scheme was introduced after the schools standards minister, David Milliband, approved the city council's application under special \"powers to innovate\". </p> <p>A delegate from Hull told Mr Clarke from the floor that she hoped that the scheme would prompt \"a domino effect\" around the country.</p> <p>She was speaking after another delegate commented about the value of free school meal vouchers; while her 15-year-old son spent \u00a33.00 a day to enjoy a rounded school meal, children on free school meals were only allocated \u00a31.75 a day.</p> <p>After highlighting the government's programme to improve healthy eating in schools, Mr Clarke hinted that should the Hull scheme yield results, the idea could be rolled out further.</p> <p>\"We are watching what happens in Hull very very carefully,\" he said. \"We know Hull is doing it well there and we will learn from the experience.\"</p> <p>Speaking following his key education address on the fourth day of Labour's annual conference in Brighton, Mr Clarke was also quizzed about the existence of religious schools, which was criticised as tantamount to \"segregation\" which could stoke up \"problems\" for the future.</p> <p>Mr Clarke failed to address the issue of religious schools directly, focusing instead on outlining a new religious education syllabus thrashed out with religious leaders from all faiths, which is to be introduced across all state schools, he said.</p> <p>\"Agreeing a way of dealing with faith in all schools strengthening the way in which things are taught is a positive one,\" he said. \"The framework we have agreed with all major faith leaders - and some minor ones - is a major step forward step which enables us to challenge this issue.\"</p> <p>The session also heard fellow panellist the children's minister, Margaret Hodge, argue against a total ban on smacking, despite pleas from the floor.</p> <p>Mrs Hodge said that although the government was considering the \"reasonable chastisement\" clause currently in place for parents who physically discipline their children, a total ban would distract professionals from focusing on priorities.</p> <p>\"Do you really help children by seeking to criminalise parents,\" she asked. \"I am not sure it is the right way forward.</p> <p>\"Is it really a good use of professionals' time - whether in the police, education, social services or health - for them to spend much of their time implementing that new law, or preventing the real abuse of children? I do not think that is the way to go.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lecturers at Britain's largest campus university were reluctantly at work today after a High Court injunction stopped a planned strike at London Metropolitan.</p> <p>Furious union officials said their campaign against the imposition of new contracts would continue - next week members will discuss whether to hold a new ballot on industrial action. </p> <p>The High Court granted an injunction sought by the university management after finding the lecturers' union Natfhe had not fulfilled a number of technical requirements, such as specifying which site members worked at. The dispute has been simmering ever since London Guildhall merged with the University of North London to form London Met, with Guildhall academic staff refusing to accept more \"managerial\" UNL-style contracts.</p> <p>Brian Roper, vice-chancellor of London Met, has said he is prepared to talk to the union \"any time, any place, anywhere\". The union insists it is also eager to negotiate as long as there are no preconditions. </p> <p>Paul Mackney, Natfhe general secretary, said: \"The university's use of anti-trade union legislation to prevent our members from exercising their legitimate right to strike is deplorable, and will only increase the determination of staff to continue the campaign. The issue is whether there is management by sensible negotiation or management by diktat and confrontation, which some managers seem to have chosen.</p> <p>\"We shall now consider ways of escalating the campaign, including continuing and strengthening the existing academic boycott. We shall consider re-balloting all of our members and [will] find appropriate actions in order to bring the dispute to a successful conclusion.\"</p> <p>The university has made no statement today.</p> <p>Greg Barnett, Natfhe chair at the university, yesterday said he was \"sad and angry\" that the university management had chosen to go to court over the dispute. He said: \"The fact that a vice chancellor who claims he is not anti-union uses bullying anti-union legislation to crush Natfhe speaks volumes about his attitude... They want to rub our noses in it.\"</p> <p>The union was prepared to negotiate with university bosses, but would not agree to preconditions - such as formally relinquishing the old contracts - before doing so, he said.</p>",

  "<p>Real Madrid teased their fans further towards the brink of despair before reviving from two goals down to avert the near certainty of a humiliatingly early elimination from \"their\" tournament. </p> <p>The club captain Ra\u00fal, struggling to escape the deepest trough of his career, scored two goals and was fouled for the penalty which provided Luis Figo with another. Roberto Carlos blew kisses to the crowd after thundering home the fourth from 30 yards. </p> <p>The identity of the match-winners was symbolic. </p> <p>Ra\u00fal and Roberto Carlos had been blamed as ringleaders of the dressing-room revolt which forced the departure of the coach Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho last week. Last night it took their joint efforts to save Camacho's caretaking successor, Mariano Garc\u00eda Rem\u00f3n, from suffering a similar fate - after nine days in the job. </p> <p>Madrid had lost their Champions League opener 3-0 in Leverkusen a fortnight ago. \"The memory of that night put us on edge at the start tonight,\" said Roberto Carlos. \"But we showed the critics we can fight for a result when we have to. That was a comeback which will go down in the club's history.\" The dramatic climax could not hide the fact that Madrid's defence looked as feeble as ever despite the addition of the Argentinian Walter Samuel from, ironically, Roma. </p> <p>Samuel, nicknamed The Wall but looking little more than a crumbling brick, appeared to have picked up the bad habits of his team-mates when Roma went ahead after three minutes. </p> <p>Alessandro Mancini had already had one shot stopped by Iker Casillas before the goalkeeper was left stranded by Daniele De Rossi after further defensive confusion. </p> <p>Madrid's initial attempt at a revival was undermined by poor passing including some erratic crosses from David Beckham. Ra\u00fal saw one shot ricochet away off a post but Figo and Roberto Carlos, twice, wasted promising attacking positions by shooting hopelessly, and prematurely, from long range. </p> <p>Roma, as much of a crisis club as Madrid, capitalised by extending their lead on 22 minutes. Superb play from their skipper Francesco Totti and Simone Perrotta set up Antonio Cassano to raise a cheer from the thousand travelling Italian supporters. </p> <p>They were duly silenced 16 minutes later when Ra\u00fal, looking more like his old self, evaded two tackles and shot beyond Ivan Pelizzoli. </p> <p>Beckham might have equalised minutes later but hit the goalkeeper from close range, so Madrid had to wait until the 53rd and Luis Figo's penalty after Ra\u00fal had been pushed by Christian Panucci. </p> <p>Ra\u00fal turned the match into a one-match show in the 72nd minute by deflecting home Figo's cross-shot. Seven more minutes and the jeers turned to cheers for Roberto Carlos.</p>",
  "<p>Allan Levy QC, a leading child law and human rights specialist and one of the best-known silks at the English bar, has died aged 62. </p> <p>Mr Levy appeared in many groundbreaking cases over two decades, involving issues such as the right to die, surrogate births, inter-country adoption and corporal punishment. He died on Sunday. </p> <p>One of his legacies was the Pindown inquiry into solitary confinement in Staffordshire children's homes, in 1991. Mr Levy labelled the regime, used against troublesome children, \"a fundamental abuse of human rights\", leading to a payout for more than 140 children. </p> <p>Backing a ban on hitting children, he won a European court of human rights ruling in 1998 that the English law allowing \"reasonable chastisement\" breached the human rights convention. </p> <p>A statement from colleagues at the chambers he headed, said: \"His leadership and guidance will be sorely missed.

  "If the energetic Liberal Democrat campaign in Hartlepool produces another spectacular success, it will be the result not only of the qualities of the candidate Jody Dunn, but also of Labour's extraordinarily risky battle plan (Labour faces byelection rift, September 28). <p>In Brent last year Labour ignored the Lib Dems, maintaining an absurd pretence that the fight was with the Tories and coming unstuck in a constituency with a large anti-war ethnic minority element whose support for Labour was far from visceral. </p> <p>This might have been right for Hartlepool, typically white and old Labour; but a reversal of strategy has seen the persistent targeting of the Lib Dems with venomous publicity, for example parodies of diamond bird-of-liberty posters with such slogans as \"Soft On Drugs\". Labour leaflets consist largely of personal attacks on Dunn, accusing her, among other things, of not being a Hartlepool United supporter. </p> <p>This probably reflects the tension between the constit uency party and the national leadership, which just assumed that Hartlepool was safe. Labour has campaigned negatively because, apart from reminding voters repeatedly of Iain Wright's local credentials, it couldn't think of anything else to do; if he wins, Labour may conclude that the end justified the means. <br> <b> Andrew Connell</b><br> Appleby, Cumbria </p> <p>Decca Aitkenhead (Today, Hartlepool, tomorrow ... , G2, September 28) wrote an illuminating background to Thursday's crucial Hartlepool byelection. My upbringing - I am 44 and have benefited from the welfare state, free education (secondary and higher) and reduced inequalities - is all thanks to Labour reforms. This is all threatened by the Blair project, never mind his immoral war crusade. </p> <p>The best possible strategy for every right-thinking Labour supporter in Hartlepool would be to stay at home or vote Liberal Democrat. This would spark the demise of Blair and the necessary transformation of a party that should have dismantled Thatcherism as it was mandated to do in 1997.<br> <b> Anthony Murphy</b><br> Bradford </p> <p>New Labour's stitch-up in Hartlepool should have been anticipated by the local party. In 1989, under orders from party HQ to nod through Peter Mandelson as candidate, the town's electoral college stood back while Mandelson and his supporters destroyed a young local rival candidate, Stephen Jones, son of the then shadow Welsh secretary. </p> <p>Jones had accused Mandelson of breaking selection rules by canvassing and talking to the press. In the brawl that followed, which I reported on, Jones's spirited wife, Kay, lost her job as local TGWU branch secretary and Jones was told he was finished as a Labour candidate. The Hartlepool party was driven by blind faith that only a man of Mandelson's stature could bring jobs to that benighted region. </p> <p>Mandelson was driven by his own ambitious agenda. The notion that Hartlepool now enjoys near full employment is a myth, unless you count dead-end jobs in call centres and the like.<br> <b> Peter Dunn</b><br> Bridport, Dorset </p> <p>Decca Aitkenhead said that Jody Dunn is writing the \"first ever candidate blog in a British election\".

  "<p>Sepp Blatter feels the Football Association may require protection against the self-interest of England's top clubs, according to reports.</p> <p>The FA has endured a difficult period recently with allegations of misconduct at the highest level. Blatter feels that as the organisation seeks to recover, the wealthy clubs from the Premiership may seek to wrest more control in a bid to strengthen an already dominant position.</p> <p>'For wealthy clubs to try to emasculate the international game by seizing control of a national football association - as I read that some fear they are trying to do in England - is unacceptable', Blatter warned.</p> <p>The Fifa president believes uncertainty over the direction and structure of the FA may afford unprecedented opportunities to the powerful few within the Premiership.

  "Burberry, once a modest and slightly stuffy British clothing company, has been transformed in the past decade into a multi-million-pound global luxury brand, one of the few to rival Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior for worldwide recognition. <p>This, clearly, is no mean feat. But brand awareness, the holy grail of marketing, is a double edged sword, as Burberry knows all too well. </p> <p>Once that distinctive camel-coloured check spills from the linings of raincoats in the English countryside to be worn by celebrities and plastered over billboards, it develops a momentum that is hard to control from HQ. </p> <p>It is a momentum which put Burberry in the headlines for all the wrong reasons when a pub chain banned wearers of the famous check because it had become associated with hooliganism. </p> <p>But Burberry has a powerful antidote. Its catwalk line, designed by the 33-year-old Briton Christopher Bailey but shown in Milan fashion week, is fast becoming one of the most highly acclaimed labels. </p> <p>Certainly there were no signs of a credibility problem at last night's show. The check took a noticeably low profile, appearing on a few handbags but no clothes. Instead, Bailey riffed brilliantly on the other Burberry signature, the trenchcoat. </p> <p>Watched from the front row by Kate Moss in a black trenchcoat from the current autumn range, this collection for next summer began with a powder blue cotton trenchcoat with three-quarter sleeves and a softly gathered waist instead of a belt, worn over a patchwork floral sundress. </p> <p>Next came a swingy jacket version of the trenchcoat in pale pink, falling softly from the shoulders but cropped to waist length; later, a lipstick-red trench was belted but cropped at the hipbone. </p> <p>It is probably no coincidence that Bailey worked under Tom Ford, the modern master of fashion brand-building, in his heyday at Gucci from 1996 to 2001. He has Ford's knack for using the catwalk to give a big company with many elements a strong identity, and fusing elements of a brand's heritage with new ideas. </p> <p>They say the best dressed man is an Englishman with an Italian tailor, or vice versa, and this marriage of tastes is much in evidence at Burberry. </p> <p>This was in many ways a very British collection - who after all but a rain-hardened Brit would design a summer outfit made up of a skirt, a blouse, a cardigan, jacket and scarf, but with touches of very Milanese sophistication. </p> <p>There were echoes of Prada in the cardigans and broaches, and of Marni in the fit of the jackets. The overall effect was pure class, a neat answer to the baseball cap brigade.</p>",
  "<p>The video, projected on to a screen that fills the entire proscenium arch, shows a naked man. He walks towards the viewer, but there is a rubber cord around his waist, attached to the wall behind him, constantly pulling him back. A woman stands to one side, staring impassively ahead of her. The screen goes up. On the stage behind, a naked man is re-enacting the same, endless sequence while a woman dressed like the one in the video stands nearby. Another video, this time projected on to the rear wall of the stage, shows a woman savagely brushing and combing her hair with a steel brush and comb. It is replaced by images that show her cutting a five-pointed star into her stomach with a razor blade. </p> <p>We are in the painful, perilous, mesmerising world of performance artist Marina Abramovic. The scenes belong to a work to be premiered today at the Teatro Palladium in Rome during the annual RomaEuropa festival. Part anthology, part biography, part video show, The Biography Remix also points to the direction in which Abramovic hopes to steer performance art, which she helped to pioneer in the 1970s and of which she is today one of the world's leading creators and interpreters. </p> <p>Abramovic has been putting on representations of her life and work since the late-1980s, when her all-consuming partnership with the man known only as Ulay, the frustrated walker in the video, broke down. They turned their split into an epic performance. Abramovic set off from one end of the Great Wall of China, Ulay from the other, and when they met in the middle, each having walked more than 1,500 miles, they said goodbye. \"Afterwards, I was in such pain, mentally and physically, that I could not go back to my own work,\" said Abramovic. \"The only way I could see a solution was if I could take some kind of distance from myself by staging my own life.\" Since then, she has been creating and performing an updated Biography every four or five years. </p> <p>Born in 1946 in Belgrade, Abramovic is the daughter of partisans. Her mother joined the Communist party, she says, after her grandfather, the Orthodox Patriarch of Serbia, was murdered on the orders of the king by having ground diamonds put in his food. \"He was declared a saint,\" she adds. </p> <p>Abramovic had her first exhibition as a painter at 16. In 1968, while other kids were putting flowers in their hair, Abramovic was trying out Russian roulette and discovering Zen Buddhism. Six years later, she left what was then Yugoslavia to settle in Amsterdam. At different times since, she has lived with Tibetan monks and Australian aborigines (\"next to the Lake of Disappointment\"). At the Venice Biennale in 1997, and to the horror of the Montenegran authorities who had sponsored her, she performed a work entitled Balkan Baroque, which involved her tenderly washing 1,500 bloodied bones. It won her the top award, the Golden Lion. </p> <p>The last thing you expect her to be is jolly. But she is. She bubbles with bright-eyed enthusiasm and smiles easily. Sitting across the table in a plain white blouse and black skirt, she could be the local building society manager. It is hard to believe that when rehearsals resume, she will be dangling above the stage, bare-breasted and holding a snake in each hand. She has worked with producers on her biographies before, but always retained artistic control. This time, however, she surrendered the last word to the Belgian director and choreographer Michael Laub, even going so far as to sign a contract to that effect. \"I didn't ask her to do that,\" says Laub quickly. </p> <p>Abramovic's gesture reflects a belief that the way forward for performance art is for works to be reperformed, and even reinterpreted, by artists other than the creator. \"I wanted to open up the idea of performance as being like a music score. If you can play Bach hundreds of years after his death and make techno-Bach, why can't you reperform the pieces of an artist of a different generation?\" </p> <p>Next month, she is to put on a series of seven pieces at the Guggenheim in New York. All but one were conceived by other artists from whom Abramovic sought formal permission and instruction. \"I wanted to establish some kind of example of how it really should be done,\" she says. \"Until now, there have been a few attempts at reperforming old pieces, by several different artists, but always like a kind of parody, and without asking permission or taking care of the original material.\" </p> <p>The Biography Remix is the same idea, but in reverse. It is a Laub creation using Abramovic originals, truly a remix. Laub scrapped the chronological format Abramovic used in the past, and brought in other performers. One moment you are watching the young Abramovic on video, the next Abramovic played by one of her young students, then Abramovic in the flesh. </p> <p>Trying to make theatre out of a kind of performance art that involves testing the limits of physical and men tal resistance raises special problems. One of Abramovic's most famous performances is Light/Dark, in which she and Ulay slapped each others' faces, increasing in speed till they could go no faster. Laub decided to \"serialise\" it by using several couples. \"The difference between performance art and, say, repertory theatre, is that when Marina and Ulay decided to do something as strictly physical as slapping each other in the face for 20 minutes, they didn't really care if they ended up in hospital the next day, because they were very committed and they didn't have to reproduce the piece,\" he said. \"It's sort of hard as a director to ask these young people to rehearse that.\" He had managed, he said, \"by apologising a lot\". And maintaining a stock of ice packs. A book on the making of The Biography Remix includes a photograph of one performer on her back at the end of a rehearsal with ice packs on one knee and the side of her face. </p> <p>At times, Laub's production transcends Abramovic's performances to make a different creative statement. One of her most powerful works is Rest Energy, from 1980. While she gripped a bow at arm's length with the arrow pointing towards her, Ulay held the arrow to the bowstring with his fingers, then they both leaned backwards till the bowstring was taut and the arrow was aiming straight at her heart. Microphones attached to their chests provided the soundtrack. </p> <p>\"This is a very difficult piece where you really risk your life,\" said Abramovic. But it is also about love, trust and mutual dependence. And in Laub's production, that comes across even more clearly than the danger, as illuminated digital strips on either side of the couple flash the timeline of their relationship. \"1977. We talk to each other in our dreams. 1985. We stop making love.\" </p> <p>The effect is redoubled when you know that the man up on the stage holding the arrow, with the power of life and death over Abramovic, is Ulay's son. \"I never even knew he existed. He hid it from me,\" said Abramovic. \"He already had one son in Germany by his first wife, and I think he was maybe ashamed that he twice left children behind.\" </p> <p>Jurriaan Sebastian L\u00f6wensteyn, 32, was working in the theatre, backstage making sets. \"Why I am doing this is mostly to explore the past, to explore physically and emo tionally what Ulay and Marina did,\" he is quoted as saying in the book. </p> <p>The Biography Remix coincides with several turning points in Abramovic's life. She is giving up teaching next month and leaving Amsterdam after 27 years to divide her non-working time between a flat in Rome, a loft in New York and a house in the Mediterranean. \"On Stromboli.\" I should have guessed. \"Stromboli is the last permanently active volcano in Europe,\" she said, leaning forward intently with her dark eyes flashing. \"Every 20 minutes, it's shooting out lava. Every 20 minutes. Black sand. Black beach. Everything black. It's fantastic.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Biography Remix is at the Teatro Palladium, Piazza Bartolomeo Romano, Rome, on September 29 and 30, and October 1 and 2.

  "<p> UK developer <a href=\"http://www.iomo.co.uk/\">IOMO</a> has hovered in the Java download chart for the last few months with its simple but extremely playable Pub titles - and now the company is extending its range. Joining best-sellers Pub Pool and Pub Darts will be Pub Pinball, Pub Fruity, Pub Football and, best of all (if only because I suggested it to the company and they went and made it), Pub Fight.</p> <p>Due out over the next month, Pub Football allows players to take part in a virtual sunday morning pub league. As with previous titles in the series, the designers are keen to accurately capture the full pub atmos (Pub Darts memorably had seventies flock wallpaper behind the board), so games will take place on municipal pitches covered in litter and dog mess. We're also expecting a generous selection of crops, badly timed tackles and fat blokes having to take a rest five minutes after kick off.</p> <p>Pub Pinball takes you back indoors as you compete on a traditional pinball table - covered in fag burns obviously. Pub Fruit provides a classic 'bandit' fruit machine with nudge, hold, reel spins and minigames. Then there's Pub Fight in which you must protect your bar from a series of drunken opponents ranging from goths to skinheads and crusties. I'm hoping that each class of bar fighter will have their own signature moves, and that perhaps each fight will be occasionally interrupted by girls in short skirts screaming, 'Don't Kev, it's not worth it!'.</p> <p>I quite like the way that mobile games can get away with taking the mick like this, messing about with themes you could never explore in a full console or PC release. Not sure where the Pub series can go next though. There's always Pub Meal in which you attempt to fend off botchulism after consuming a dodgy chicken curry at the local Ravenous Rat(tm) family pub. Or maybe just Pub Closing Time, where you have to fight your way home through pools of puke, dropped kebab hazards and gangs of sub-human males looking to end their delightful evening of sparkling conversation by putting someone in hospital.</p> <p>No wonder the Pub games are so successful - the idealised image of traditional pub life that they portray is now starkly at odds with the <a href=\"http://uk.news.yahoo.com/040520/140/eu405.html\">reality</a> of a friday night on the town. Maybe IOMO should just release Pub, a game that allows you to sit and enjoy a pint of well kept beer in a traditional English public house, where decent music plays softly in the background, where there are no vodka-based fizzy pop drinks, or themed interiors, where you can smoke if you like without upsetting the family diners eating from a franchised, centrally-prepared menu dispatched to 300 other identical pubs in the vicinity.</p> <p>Forget it, these might be games, but they have to have <em>some</em> basis in reality.</p>",
  "Labour today apologised for a \"disgraceful\" leaflet which attacked the Liberal Democrats for supporting a site for Travellers and Gypsies. <p>The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) demanded an explanation after the pamphlet was distributed in the Llanedeyrn and Pentwyn wards in Cardiff in the run-up to June's local elections. </p> <p>An inquiry set up by the Welsh Labour Executive concluded that party officers outside the ward had been unaware of the leaflet prior to its distribution. </p> <p>Labour lost Cardiff council to no overall control in the poll, with the Lib Dems now the largest party. </p> <p>A statement from the Welsh Labour executive said: \"The leaflet dealt with the issue of Travellers' sites in a totally inappropriate manner. Welsh Labour believes that, where such issues are raised in political debate, it should be done responsibly and as a means of addressing prejudice, not pandering to it. It is acknowledged that the leaflet breaches the cross-party concordat on these issues. </p> <p>\"Welsh Labour apologises that the leaflet appeared in the name of the party and that its distribution, however limited, was not prevented. We accepted that the use of the images concerned was likely to cause offence to the Travelling community and to residents of Llanedeyrn and Pentwyn and could undermine good relations between them.</p> <p>\"The Welsh Labour executive censures the individuals involved and rebukes them for their part in the leaflet's production and distribution. It is anticipated that the individuals concerned will subscribe to the apology made by the Welsh executive. </p> <p>\"It is extremely disappointing that the issuing of this leaflet has undermined the very positive work that Welsh Labour has done through the national assembly and the Welsh assembly government in promoting a positive approach towards Travellers' issues through the assembly's equality of opportunity committee's review of service provision in Wales for Travellers and Gypsies.\" </p> <p>The CRE's commissioner for Wales, Cherry Short, said: \"This leaflet was a disgrace. </p> <p>\"It flew in the face of Labour's stated commitment to anti-racism. The forthright statement by the Welsh Labour executive on this issue is to be welcomed. The party now needs to put in place the kind of measures which can ensure that all members of the party know that such campaigning activities are wrong.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jacqueline Wilson's divorce is being finalised, and a group of boys have chosen this time to deliberately smash one of her windows. The children appeared in her garden at nightfall. </p> <p>\"Jacqueline Wilson, we know you're in there,\" they shouted. \"Come on out, we like your books.\" She stood still, but the ruckus carried on. She thought they sounded about 12 years old - her constituency, exactly - so she called back, without opening the door: \"Glad you like the books, lads. Off you go, now, it's late.\" Which was when one of them hurled a rock through the window. She didn't know whether to chase after them. \"If they could do that to a window, what might they do to me?\" </p> <p>The divorce and the broken window are not connected, but they both coincide with the time when Wilson is about to move house for the first time in 30 years - an unsettling enough time as it is. She didn't even feel she could report the incident to the police. She didn't want the headlines pitting her - an author for whose signings children will queue for eight hours - against 12 year olds. So instead she muses about the increased sense of anxiety in her own home and how a friend said: \"Wow, if that's what the children who like your stuff do ... \" </p> <p>It will probably turn up in a book, though, an evening jaunt that starts out gently enough, kids enjoying the last long evenings, but then they hype each other up and end up throwing bricks. Wilson is a feelgood writer - which is how she became Britain's most borrowed author, ousting Catherine Cookson from the top spot - but she also writes about how things turn. Her new book, The Diamond Girls, traces two parallel families - one chaotic, one ordered. But appearances deceive, and there's always the possibility of change. </p> <p>As for the divorce, it is six years since her policeman husband left her for another woman. After a long separation, they are now getting the decree absolute. \"Inevitably,\" she says, with a small smile, \"it's me making a settlement on him, rather than the other way round.\" </p> <p>Not that long ago, the divorce settlement would not have worked out that way. Though Wilson famously worked at a pace of 2,000 words a day, while her daughter was at nursery, then school, real fortune has come her way only recently. She has now made what she calls \"a wonderful large amount of money\". </p> <p>It was a marriage of different types: she bookish, he not. She bought so many books that there literally was not room for a washing machine. So she did, by hand, his three shirts a day: \"Work shirt, leisure shirt, formal shirt,\" she says, listing them and looking at me with straightforward wonder: \"What was I thinking of?\" </p> <p>Sometimes she had to sidle into the house with her latest book purchases - her money, but it was the space issue - concealed in supermarket bags. \"But also he could be quite proud, in a way, that I read these books.\" </p> <p>What she finds odd is how little he took from their life together. \"I found it funny when he left and took one suitcase of belongings - everything else in the house was mine.\" </p> <p>In her books, bad marriages are more highly coloured - comic-strip abusive or violent. But this is her dramatising of ordinary grief. It is a trick she also plays with the overarching relationship in all her work: the bad mother/daughter axis. </p> <p>She acknowledges that such a relationship is part of her background, though it emerges more stylised in her books, with added alcoholism, say. The problems are added to colour a more everyday reality, a mother and daughter who just don't get each other. At all. </p> <p>\"We're very different sorts of women [my mother and I],\" she tells me. Her mother is 81 now, and living nearby. \"We've always seen things from very different points of view; extremely different. We've always been close in a way, because I'm an only child, but we don't have the same values.\" </p> <p>Because this is Jacqueline Wilson, though, there's a happy ending. Both women have lived long enough to make it up. \"In the last couple of years,\" she says, \"there's been a real mellowing.\" And then she says something which, coming from a woman who is herself nearing 60, shows just how critical this axis can be. </p> <p>\"She now seems relatively proud of me,\" says Wilson, \"which is delightful in a way, because we all like it if our mum thinks we've done well.\" But it's the word \"relatively\" that is the give-away: a gentle, Wilsonian word, indicating a quiet hurt as sad as any of the drastic suffering in her novels, and one that has powered her stories. </p> <p><strong> The Diamond Girls</strong>, by Jacqueline Wilson, <br> published by Doubleday, <br> price \u00a310.99. <br> Ages 10-14<br></p>",
  "David Blunkett will today tell Labour delegates he would rather be tough in government than compassionate in opposition, as he unveils key planks in Labour's law and order electoral strategy. <p>In his address to the Brighton conference this afternoon, the home secretary is to announce bringing forward recruitment for extra community support officers (CSOs) - despite some opposition from rank and file police officers.</p> <p>He will also boast of record police numbers, in a speech which will tackle head-on his reputation as a hardline home secretary.</p> <p>He is due to say: \"I would rather be a tough home secretary in a compassionate Labour government than a compassionate opponent of a rightwing Tory government.\" </p> <p>Mr Blunkett said CSOs - there are already 4,000 - act as a deterrent to criminals as well as a means of \"catching\" them. </p> <p>They do not have police powers to arrest, but are linked by radio to police stations and can summon help quickly. </p> <p>But there has been opposition from some forces, who view them as \"plastic policemen\". </p> <p>\"They are preventive because if they are there, visible, available on the street, opportunistic crime will drop,\" Mr Blunkett said. </p> <p>\"And it has done in the areas where the initial CSOs have been deployed. </p> <p>\"Obviously it's different in central London where they have been deployed to release the police back into the neighbourhood to pick up the terrorism counter-surveillance work.\" </p> <p>The government has already promised to have 25,000 officers in place by 2008. It was to start recruiting after April, but this will now happen next month. </p> <p>The organisation representing frontline police warned just this month that the increased use of CSOs in confrontational situations was putting the public at risk. </p> <p>The Police Federation said the civilian wardens were being deployed to unsuitable duties for which they had not been trained. </p> <p>But Mr Blunkett will insist they help, rather than replace, traditional policemen. </p> <p>He will underline that by announcing new record numbers of police. The latest figures show there are now 139,728 officers in England and Wales - more than ever before. </p> <p>There are 10,000 more than two years ago and 16,000 more than in 2000. </p> <p>Tony Blair yesterday promised a \"new approach\" to the law and order agenda. </p> <p>All communities would have their own dedicated policing teams, he said - admitting that he had taken the idea from the success of London mayor Ken Livingstone's pilots.</p> <p>The latest crime survey showed a slight dip in fear of crime. But Labour strategists say it is still a vital electoral issue. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett said he would be announcing \"additional resources\" for counter-terrorism in his address.</p> <p>Also taking to the platform stage at the Labour party conference in Brighton today are Charles Clarke, the education secretary, John Reid on health, and a star turn from VIP guest Bono, of U2, on international debt relief.</p>",

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: Italian hostages freed, hope for Ken Bigley and Rooneymania hits the back pages. </p> <p><b>BLAIR IS CONTRITE BUT NOT SORRY</b> </p> <p>Tony Blair's speech to the party faithful garners acres of newsprint across all the newspapers. The Mirror treats him best, focusing its coverage on the prime minister's 10 pledges to take Labour into an historic third term. </p> <p>\"Power, wealth and opportunity in the hands of the many not the few. That was, and is, our mission,\" he declared. (The package of pledges includes better schools and more choice for parents, better childcare for all parents of school-age children, a GBP1bn boost for science, and ID cards introduced in three years.) </p> <p>The Mail is most critical of Blair, dissecting his promises under the headline \"Rehash, reheat, recycle\", and giving a lot of space to protests by the Countryside Alliance (along with more photographs of scantily-clad female protesters than even the tabloids dare show). Max Hastings is given two pages to attack \"the maestro of saccharine sincerity\", on taxes, pensions, immigration and Iraq. \"The British public will never trust his word again about whether it's Tuesday or Wednesday.\" </p> <p>For the other papers, it is Iraq that dominates, specifically the lack of an open apology for the situation in Iraq - an apology, the Guardian notes, that appeared in the draft given to journalists. \"I know this issue has divided the country,\" he said, \"I entirely understand why many disagree.\" But the next line, \"I am genuinely sorry about that,\" was removed from the delivered speech. The paper says he offered his most \"contrite justification for the conflict so far\". </p> <p>That is not how it appears to the Sun. \"I was right over Iraq,\" thunders the paper. \"I can't sincerely apologise for removing Saddam,\" the paper quotes, but adds the PM admitted he was wrong about the existence of weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>The FT uses this admission to give the impression Mr Blair did apologise for Iraq, and notes a comment to an anti-war heckler that drew applause: \"You can make your protest.

  "It was a moving portrayal of everyday life in the rural classroom, and became an huge and unexpected French cinema success when it was released in 2002. <p>And, as the star of the prizewinning documentary film, Etre et Avoir, Georges Lopez felt it was only fair that he should get a cut of the \u20ac2m (\u00a31.3m) profits. </p> <p>The director disagreed, triggering an acrimonious lawsuit which has raised uncomfortable ethical questions about the exploitative nature of fly-on-the-wall film-making. </p> <p>This week a Paris court ruled that the schoolteacher, who allowed his tiny one-class village school to be filmed in lessons and at play over the course of a year, had no grounds to demand a \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3170,000) payment. </p> <p>Insistent that his rights had been abused, Mr Lopez said yesterday that he would appeal. </p> <p>Had Mr Lopez won, French film unions warned, the case would \"spell the death of the documentary, undermining the crucial principle that subjects should not be paid to participate.\" </p> <p>Mr Lopez's decision to sue the documentary's makers for a healthy share of the profits soured the popular image of him as a modest, selfless schoolmaster. </p> <p>But he claimed that the film's success rested entirely on his personality, and that his teaching methods, made famous by the film, were his intellectual property. </p> <p>Mr Lopez said he felt exploited, and launched the legal suit in the face of \"lack of respect shown by the cinema world\". </p> <p>He refused a one-off payment offered by the documentary makers of \u20ac37,500, insisting he should be treated like an \"actor\" in the film and be properly remunerated. </p> <p>A court in Paris ruled that Mr Lopez deserved no payment for taking part in the project. </p> <p>In a judgment which analysed what constitutes a documentary, the court decided that the teacher had no grounds to argue that he should be treated as an actor because he was filmed as he went about his everyday professional duties. </p> <p>The court also found he had given consent for his image to be exploited in accepting to be filmed. </p> <p>Mr Lopez could not be considered a \"co-author\" of the film because he had not taken part in decisions on how to shoot the documentary. </p> <p>\"The film revealed the great professional skill of the teacher, his thoughts on his profession and the effectiveness of his teaching methods,\" the court ruled, but none of these were \"qualities that could be protected by intellectual property legislation\". </p> <p>French film-making unions were relieved. The Association of French Film-makers said: \"The nature and the economics of documentary are incompatible with any principle of remuneration.\" </p> <p>The film's director, Nicolas Philibert, visited around 300 schools before selecting the classroom in the village of Saint-Etienne-sur-Esson, Auvergne, where he was impressed by Mr Lopez's dedication and deep attachment to his pupils. </p> <p>After the film came out, the prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, requested a private viewing. </p> <p>Philibert spent seven months filming Mr Lopez, 58, for Etre et Avoir (named after the two key French verbs, meaning to be and to have), and admitted feeling \"very hurt and deeply distressed\" by the legal action, which he viewed as a \"betrayal\". </p> <p>French newspapers agreed, reporting the initial claim beneath the headline: \"To be and to have: the teacher would rather have.\" </p> <p>Claire Hocquet, who represented Philibert, said after the ruling: \"I am delighted the tribunal ruled that reality should not be paid for.\" </p> <p>She added: \"To pay someone who appears in a documentary would be to treat them as an actor, and that would be the death of documentary film-making.\" </p> <p>But the legal dispute over the film's profits is to continue later this year, when the families of seven of Mr Lopez's 11 pupils are going to court to seek payment of \u20ac20,000 each for their parts in it.</p>",

Miserable, I watch another empty hour pass by. </p> <p>But I have to do something, despite the inutility of any action. I reach for my hammer rock. Adrenaline channels into anger, and I raise the hammer, in retribution for what this wretched piece of geology has done to my hand. </p> <p>Bonk! I strike the boulder. Thwock! Again. The rage blooms purple in my mind, amid a small mushroom cloud of pulverised grit. I bring the rock down again. Carrunch! I growl with animalistic fury in response to the pain pulsing in my left hand. </p> <p>Whoa, Aron. You might have taken that too far. </p> <p>I've created a mess once again. To brush the dirt off my trapped arm, away from the open wound, I pick up my knife. Sweeping the grit off my thumb, I accidentally gouge myself and rip away a thin piece of decayed flesh. It peels back like a skin of boiled milk before I catch what is going on. I already knew my hand had to be decomposing. Without circulation, it has been dying since I became entrapped. Whenever I considered amputation, it had always been under the premise that the hand was dead and would have to be amputated once I was freed. But I hadn't known how fast the putrefaction had advanced since Saturday afternoon. </p> <p>Out of curiosity, I poke my thumb with the blade. It punctures the epidermis as if it is dipping into a stick of room-temperature butter, and releases a tell-tale hiss of escaping gas. Though the smell is faint to my desensitised nose, it is abjectly unpleasant, the stench of a carcass. </p> <p>All I want now is to simply rid myself of any connection to this decomposing appendage. </p> <p>I don't want it. </p> <p>It's not a part of me. </p> <p>I scream out in pure hate, shrieking as I batter my body to and fro against the canyon walls, losing every bit of composure that I've struggled so intensely to maintain. Then I feel my arm bend unnaturally in the unbudging grip of the chockstone. </p> <p>An epiphany strikes me with the magnificent glory of a holy intervention and instantly brings my seizure to a halt: if I torque my arm far enough, I can break my forearm bones. </p> <p>Holy Christ, Aron, that's it. That's fucking it! </p> <p>I put my left hand under the boulder and push hard, to exert a maximum downward force on my radius bone. As I slowly bend my arm down and to the left, a pow! reverberates like a muted cap-gun shot up and down Blue John Canyon. I don't say a word, but I reach to feel my forearm. There is an abnormal lump on top of my wrist. I pull my body away from the chockstone and down again, simulating the position I was just in, and feel a gap between the serrated edges of my cleanly broken arm bone. </p> <p>Without further pause and again in silence, I hump my body up over the chockstone, with a single purpose in my mind. Smearing my shoes against the canyon walls, I push with my legs and grab the back of the chockstone with my left hand, pulling with every bit of ferocity I can muster, hard, harder, and a second cap-gun shot ends my ulna's anticipation. </p> <p>Sweating and euphoric, I again touch my right arm two inches below my wrist. Both bones have splintered in the same place. </p> <p>I am overcome with the excitement of having solved the riddle of my imprisonment. Hustling to deploy the shorter and sharper of my multi-tool's two blades, I push the knife into my wrist, watching my skin stretch inwardly, until the point pierces and sinks to its hilt. In a blaze of pain, I know the job is just starting. With a glance at my watch - it is 10.32am - I motivate myself: \"OK, Aron, here we go. You're in it now.\" </p> <p>My first act is to sever, with a downward sawing motion, as much of the skin on the inside surface of my forearm as I can, without tearing any of the noodle-like veins close to the skin. Once I've opened a large enough hole in my arm, I stow the knife, holding its handle in my teeth, and poke first my left forefinger and then my left thumb inside my arm and feel around. Sorting through the bizarre and unfamiliar textures, I make a mental map of my arm's inner features. I feel bundles of muscle fibres and, working my fingers behind them, find two pairs of cleanly fractured but jagged bone ends. Now I know that soon I will be free of the rest of my crushed dead hand. </p> <p>Prodding and pinching, I can distinguish between the hard tendons and ligaments, and the soft, rubbery feel of the more pliable arteries. I should avoid cutting the arteries until the end if I can help it at all, I decide. </p> <p>Sort, pinch, rotate, slice. </p> <p>Ten, 15, or maybe 20 minutes slip past me. I am engrossed in making the surgical work go as fast as possible. The surgery is slowing down now that I have come to a stubbornly durable tendon, and I don't want to lose blood unnecessarily while I'm still trapped. I'll need every bit of it for the hike to my truck. </p> <p>Setting the knife down on the chockstone, I pick up the neoprene tubing of my CamelBak, which has been sitting there unused for the past two days. I cinch the black insulation tube in a double loop around my forearm, three inches below my elbow. Next, I quickly attach a carabiner into the tourniquet and twist it tight. </p> <p>\"Why did I have to suffer all this extra time?\" God, I must be the dumbest guy ever to have had his hand trapped by a boulder. It took me six days to figure out how I could cut off my arm. </p> <p>Continuing with the surgery, I clear out the last muscles surrounding the tendon and cut a third artery. I still haven't uttered even an \"Ow!\", I don't think, to verbalise the pain; it's a part of this experience, no more important to the procedure than the colour of my tourniquet. </p> <p>I now have relatively open access to the tendon. Sawing aggressively with the blade, I still can't put a dent in the amazingly strong fibre. It's like a doubly thick strip of reinforced box-packaging tape. I can't cut it, so I reconfigure my multi-tool for the pliers. Using them to bite into the edge of the tendon, I squeeze and twist, tearing away a fragment. Yes, this will work just fine. I tackle the most brutish task. </p> <p>Grip, squeeze, twist, tear. </p> <p>\"This is gonna make one hell of a story to tell my friends,\" I think. \"They'll never believe how I had to cut off my arm. Hell, I can barely believe it, and I'm watching myself do it.\" </p> <p>Little by little, I rip through the tendon until I totally sever the twine-like filament, then switch the tool back to the knife. There is also a pale white nerve strand, as thick as a swollen piece of angel-hair pasta. I put the knife's edge under the nerve and pluck it, like lifting a guitar string two inches off its frets, until it snaps. It recalibrates my personal scale of what it feels like to be hurt - it's as though I have thrust my arm into a cauldron of magma. </p> <p>It is 11:32am, Thursday, May 1 2003. Pulling tight the remaining connective tissues of my arm, I rock the knife against the wall, and the final thin strand of flesh tears loose; tensile force rips the skin apart more than the blade cuts it. </p> <p>I fall back against the far wall of the canyon: I AM FREE! </p> <p>I glance at the bloody afterbirth smeared on the chockstone and the northern canyon wall. The spattering on the chockstone hides the dark mass of my amputated hand and wrist, but the white bone ends of my abandoned ulna and radius protrude visibly from the gory muddle. </p> <p>OK, that's enough. The clock is running, Aron. Get out of here. </p> <p>It takes me 20 minutes to cover the next 150 yards. I finally burst into the sun on a rock shelf midway up a sheer-walled amphitheatre 150ft deep. Fortunately, I am prepared for this: I have my harness, rappel device, and a sufficient length of beefy rope. To my left are two bolts drilled into the rock. This is the Big Drop rappel. </p> <p>I hastily clip myself into the anchor and set to work untangling the 170ft remaining length of my originally 200ft rope. Out of sight to my left, one end of the rope inadvertently slides over the lip of the rappel ledge. I hear the distinctive zip-zip of the slinking rope and turn to watch it slithering out of sight over the edge. Instinctively, I jump on the tail of the rope with my left foot. If I drop the rope, the game is over. </p> <p>Doing the rappel one-handed means I don't have any way to reach out and sta bilise myself when I start to swing one direction or the other. A moment of giddy delight replaces my anxiety as I spin around to face the amphitheatre, gliding down the rope. </p> <p>Touching down, I lunge for the mud-ringed puddle I saw from above. Scooping the bottle through the pool twice, I again fill it with the brown water. The first droplets meet my tongue - the water is cool, and best of all, it's sweet as an after-dinner port. </p> <p>I wish I could rest and let the water enter my system, but I'm slowly bleeding out, and I have three, maybe four hours to go from here. Marching into the sunny, sandy canyon bottom, I start my eight-mile trek. </p> <p>At mile two of my march, at 1:09pm, I come to the confluence of Blue John and Horseshoe canyons and take a left toward the Great Gallery without missing a stride. </p> <p>The blood from my stump is dripping quickly now, despite my tourniquet and wrappings, and several dozen red splotches appear in the sandy mud as I try to get more water into my CamelBak. The pain in my arm aches insistently around the tourniquet. The pain tempts me to sit and regain strength, but I know I have to press on. </p> <p>At mile six, I make a left turn heading toward a colossal alcove that must be a hundred yards wide and at least that tall. There, 70 yards ahead of me, walking side by side by side, are three hikers, one smaller than the other two. </p> <p>Other people! I can't believe it. I manage a feeble \"Help!\" After a deep breath, I make another, stronger shout: \"HELP!\" </p> <p>Once close enough, I begin telling them, \"My name is Aron Ralston. I was trapped by a boulder on Saturday, and I've been without food and water for five days. I cut my arm off this morning to get free, and I've lost a lot of blood. I need medical attention.\" </p> <p>I finish my announcement and we come to a stop, face to face, a few feet away from each other. I'm coated in blood on my right side from my shirt collar to my shoe tip. I look at the boy - he can't be more than 10 years old - and fear that I've just scarred him for life. </p> <p>The man speaks: \"They told us you were here.\" </p> <p>\"We have to get moving.\" </p> <p>The dad nods but protests: \"You should stop and rest.\" </p> <p>I reiterate my command: \"No, we need to keep hiking.\" </p> <p>The family trots to catch up to me as the dad replies, \"There are police at the parking. They told us to keep an eye out for you. We told them we would.\" </p> <p>\"Do you have a phone?\" I ask again. They do not. </p> <p>\"I am Eric, and this is Monique and Andy,\" the dad replies. \"We are the Meijers, from Holland.\" </p> <p>\"OK, Eric, you guys look pretty fit. I need one of you to run ahead and get to the police at the trailhead.\" </p> <p>\"Monique can run - she is fast.\" </p> <p>Still hiking along, I look to his wife, and she nods. I look at Monique. \"Please, now, go fast.\" </p> <p>It is mile seven, and a few minutes after 3pm. The sun is beating down hard on the shadeless sand at the bottom of the 800ft-deep Horseshoe Canyon. It will kill me if I try to hike out of this canyon. I've lost too much blood; I'm on the verge of deadly shock. I contemplate sending Eric up to get help as well, but before I can say anything, the rapid stutter of a booming echo interrupts my thoughts: thwock-thwock-thwock. </p> <p>Two hundred yards in front of us, the metallic body of a wingless black bird rises over the canyon wall. Eric catches up to stand beside me, and we watch the helicopter begin its descent. The engine whine falls, and the dusty wind at my back dies to a breeze. A figure motions for me. I walk briskly to where the man is standing at the side door of the chopper. He yells, \"Are you Aron?\" </p> <p>I nod and shout into his ear, \"Yes. Can I get a lift?\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This edited extract is the last instalment in a three-part serialisation of Between a Rock and a Hard Place, by Aron Ralston, published by Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>",

  "Tony Blair's speech triggered announcements across Whitehall of legislation to extend anti-discrimination laws to Muslims and people of other faiths, introduce electronic border checks by December, and mandatory drug testing of 240,000 people arrested each year. <p>The prime minister said the decision to change the law to make discrimination on religious grounds unlawful was necessary to \"demonstrate to Muslims here in Britain\" that the values of liberty, tolerance and the rule of law extended to \"all our citizens\". </p> <p>The Home Office said the legislation, which is expected to be included in a bill setting up a human rights commission, would extend existing protection against religious discrimination at work or on training schemes. The law would ban discrimination on grounds of religion \"in the provision of goods, services, facilities and premises\". </p> <p>A Home Office official said that religious groups such as Sikhs and Jews were already protected, and the measure would extend such protection to Christians and Muslims. </p> <p>Mr Blair's pledge to build an \"electronic border\" around Britain triggered the announcement of Project Semaphore, in which the details of all travellers to and from the UK on 10 air routes would be logged by the end of this year. </p> <p>The pilot project was called \"the first phase of the e-borders\" programme and will mean immigration computers will be able to track when travellers enter and leave the country. </p> <p>The \"radical extension of compulsory drug testing for offenders\" will also involve legislation. </p> <p>At present, the police can insist on a mandatory drug test for anyone they charge who they suspect is a drug user. Legislation will extend this power to anyone arrested. The Home Office said it expected the change to double the number of offenders tested for drugs to some 240,000 a year.</p> <p>The health secretary, John Reid, also announced an extra \u00a3219m over two years to boost drug treatment programmes.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine you've got this big old beanbag, you've had it all your life. It used to be the biggest one you could get, a supersize beanbag. But recently some of the stuffing's come out and it's become all baggy and saggy, too much bag for your beans. You decide to have it fixed up, to have it made into a smaller, neater beanbag. So you take it to the beanbag man. </p> <p>The beanbag man first takes a bit more of the remaining stuffing out - by unzipping the cover a little, pushing in the nozzle of his vacuum cleaner and sucking out some of the little polystyrene balls. Schlerp. That's better. But now the cover's way too loose so he has to make it smaller. He does this by making cuts and taking out big strips of material, then sewing it up again. It's a long and painstaking process. </p> <p>And at the end of it all? Well, frankly, it's a bit of a mess - shapeless and ugly, and it leaks little polystyrene balls from where the man sewed it back together. But you don't really notice, you think it looks just grand, ready to be enjoyed again. </p> <p>That's what happened to a British woman called Valerie Rogers. Except it wasn't her beanbag, of course; it was her body. Valerie is <strong> The Woman Swamped By Her Own Skin</strong> (Five). </p> <p>She used to weigh nearly 40 stone, but after two years on a low-carb diet, she'd lost 22 of them, almost a stone a month. Trouble is, her skin didn't shrink back to fit her new 18-stone body, so she looked like a Shar-Pei - you know, one of those funny wrinkly dogs with too much skin. </p> <p>Enter Kansas-based Dr Ted Lockwood, pioneer of the \"circumferential body lift\", the biggest and most dangerous cosmetic operation procedure in the world: 12 hours of extreme surgery. Valerie's good at explaining it to the layman: \"It's a bit like pulling your jeans up, and pulling your shirt down,\" she says, cheerfully. And thanks to Five, we get to watch. </p> <p>A lot of people seem to be going under the knife for our entertainment at the moment, both fictionally (Nip/Tuck), and for real (Live Cosmetic Surgery). But never quite on this scale before. It's not easy viewing. </p> <p>First Dr Ted gives Valerie a vigorous five-hour bout of liposuction, sucking out the fat right down to her ankles. Then he gets down to removing the maximum amount of fat and skin permitted by US law - for Valerie that's two-and-a-half stone, or 13% of her total weight. Which means some serious carving - huge white slabs of tripe are sliced out, then dumped in a bucket. There goes her belly button; that's OK, he'll make her another. God, what's that? It looks like an octopus ... </p> <p>I found it very hard to watch, even through my fingers. Fascinating, but also one of the nastiest things I've ever seen on TV. Much better to think of it all in terms of beanbags and little polystyrene balls. </p> <p>After the operation, Valerie feels like a truck has run over her, and then backed up and run over her again, just as Dr Lockwood said she would. But a few weeks later, back in England, the picture is brighter. \"I feel more feminine, more like a female,\" she says, trying on clothes. \"I feel sexier. So there you go, that can't be a bad thing.\" No, I suppose it can't. </p> <p>And the clown who made this programme plays it out with ELO's Mr Blue Sky: </p> <p> \"Hey you with the pretty face </p> <p>Welcome to the human race.\" </p> <p>I think there's been a terrible mistake. A busload of unhinged D-list celebrities was supposed to be delivered to The Priory. Take them to the funny farm, said the driver's boss. But the driver didn't hear the funny part, so he took them to <strong> The Farm</strong> (Five) instead. </p> <p>Here they are, then, wrestling maniacally with pigs, tossing croissants to the ducks and tugging away in vain at poor Rita's udders. Which may be bad news for Rita, but is very entertaining for us. I mean, it's obviously a big steaming cowpat of a show, and the only interesting revelation up to now has been that Rebecca Loos rhymes with dose and not with moose, but of course it's also highly addictive. Fabulous mix of cast, too. </p> <p>Favourite bits so far? Lady Victoria Hervey's assumption that Stan Collymore was Vanilla Ice; Paul Daniels storming out; Debbie McGee staying; and someone called Ritchie Neville's attempts to get noticed. </p> <p>Stan Collymore actually seems quite handy with a sheep.

  "<p>French electronics giant Thomson is emerging as the frontrunner in the race for the Moving Picture Company, the facility put up for sale by ITV as part of a \u00a3500m disposal programme.</p> <p>The French company, which acquired Technicolor from MPC's former owner Carlton four years ago, is the favourite to edge ahead in what MediaGuardian.co.uk has learned is a \"three-horse race\" for the business when the deadline for final bids expires on Friday.</p> <p>Six companies have already submitted preliminary bids after completing due diligence on the facility - which recently completed the special effects on British romantic comedy Wimbledon - but sources close to ITV said they expected that to be whittled down to three by the time the last bids are received.</p> <p>Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP is understood to have expressed initial interest but, in the light of the group's \u00a3845m acquisition of Grey Global, the appetite to clinch the MPC deal has waned, say insiders.</p> <p>Carlyle, a US buyout and venture capital firm, is also understood to have put in a preliminary offer but its bid would be unlikely to progress without the backing of management, which is likely to be \"locked in\" as part of any successful deal.</p> <p>Thomson is emerging as the frontrunner but is likely to face competition from Rank subsidiary Deluxe and the former Carlton chairman, Michael Green, according to ITV sources.</p> <p>The French company already owns Complete Post, one of three Carlton facilities sold by the former chief executive, Stephen Cain, as part of a non-core disposals policy in the 90s. </p> <p>But Mr Green, who expressed initial interest in the business but has since gone quiet, could easily ride in with a last-minute offer, sources predict.</p> <p>He used MPC as a vehicle to build his then nascent media empire in the early 80s but lost control of the facility when he was ousted as the ITV chairman-elect seven months ago. </p> <p>Despite instigating a programme of non-core disposals under Mr Cain, Mr Green held on to MPC despite selling two other facility businesses: Complete Post in Los Angeles to Technicolor/Thomson and TVI in London to 4MC, now Ascent Media.</p> <p>Buying MPC would provide Thomson with a UK-based entry into the high end film business, including a foothold in the growing market in digital intermediates - films post-produced entirely on computers.</p> <p>While Rank has indicated its Deluxe film processing and distribution unit could be hived off as part of a plan to concentrate on its Mecca Bingo and Hard Rock Cafe chains, that has not stopped Deluxe making acquisitions</p> <p>Just last month Deluxe acquired the 80% it did not already own in US digital film lab eFilm, which carried out the digital intermediates on Spider-Man 2 and The Passion of the Christ. Adding a UK facility would give it further international clout and act as a counterweight to its seasonal DVD business.</p> <p>After Tangent, the investment vehicle run by Mr Green, lost out in the race to buy Odeon and UCI cinemas, sources say his appetite for ITV's other major non-core assets, such as Carton Screen Advertising, has waned. This increases the likelihood of him bidding for MPC.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>The long awaited merger between cable companies Telewest and NTL is believed to be on ice for at least another year - possibly two - as investors in the two firms continue to jostle for position. </p> <p>In one of the longest running sagas in the history of the UK media industry, cable companies have spent the past 15 years consolidating to the point where there are just two major players left. </p> <p>Both have recently emerged from protracted debt restructuring so some analysts expected merger talks to begin later this year. </p> <p>However, insiders have cautioned that it is likely to be \"between 12 and 24 months\" before the bondholders that control both companies begin thinking about serious merger talks. </p> <p>A merger of NTL and Telewest would take their total number of pay-TV subscribers to more than 3 million and the two companies have more than 1.5 million broadband customers between them. Sky, in contrast, has more than 7 million subscribers. </p> <p>The firms' financial woes in recent years have left them unable to challenge Sky's sizeable marketing muscle. However, NTL and Telewest are believed to be planning a fresh assault on the pay-TV market in the new year with the launch of set-top box technology and pay-per-view services. </p> <p>Bill Huff, the New Jersey hedge fund manager who has a significant stake in both companies, is understood to have decided to wait before triggering takeover talks in which he is expected to play a major role. </p> <p>Legislation introduced by the Tory government in the early 80s restricted cable companies to operating in a single local area. This meant they lacked the scale to compete with the Sky satellite system. </p> <p>The next 15 years were characterised by a series of merger talks and takeovers as a string of US investors ploughed billions into consolidating the various cable franchises and then standardising the technology. </p> <p>They ran up huge debts in the process, with NTL forced to the brink of bankruptcy and Telewest \u00a35.3bn in debt. Both recently emerged from debt for equity schemes that slashed billions from their balance sheets. </p> <p>The two companies are now optimistic about their growth prospects. They believe broadband is driving a revival of interest in the \"triple play\" offering of TV, telephone and internet access. </p> <p>Within two years both companies hope to be able to offer broadband at speeds of up to 20Mb, far outstripping BT's service. </p> <p>The conversion of the last of their analogue customers to digital will also free up substantial amounts of spare network capacity that can be used for new services. </p> <p>Using this increased capacity, they hope to be able to offer the long promised cheap telephone and video-on-demand services that will finally deliver on the promises they have been making for the past 15 years. </p> <p>The new managers at NTL and Telewest also hope the recent slowdown in Sky subscription growth will allow them to make headway against the pay-TV giant. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>Emap continued the waiting game over a bid for Scottish Radio Holdings yesterday as the media group warned that a merged Capital Radio and GWR would not dominate the radio advertising market. </p> <p>Gary Hughes, Emap finance director, said Capital and GWR, which are expected to give details on a planned merger today, would not grab advertising revenue from rivals if they agreed a deal. </p> <p>Advertisers want to broadcast to big cities across the UK and a combined Capital and GWR would not offer that service, said Mr Hughes, who also chairs Emap's radio division. </p> <p>\"What we have with Capital and GWR is a big radio company but not a perfectly formed one. It would provide the market with a major player in terms of share of advertising but it's hard to see how radio buyers and planners will change their behaviour if there is one big group in the market,\" he said. </p> <p>GWR would contribute a national licence - Classic FM - to the deal but its 32 local stations mainly cover smaller towns. However, Capital is the dominant broadcaster in London and also has stations in Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and Glasgow. </p> <p>Emap also owns stations in those cities, except Glasgow, but has other stations in Leeds and Liverpool. Emap owns 28% of SRH and it wants to add the Scottish company's stations in Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen to its radio footprint. </p> <p>Mr Hughes said a Capital-GWR deal would not force Emap into taking full control of SRH: \"We don't feel pressure from the potential combination. It does not necessarily mean we have to move towards consolidation. </p> <p>\"We have a robust position in the cities that [advertising] buyers want.\" </p> <p>The comments followed a trading statement from Emap yesterday. The magazines, radio and exhibitions group said like-for-like revenues for the six months to September 30 would be 2% higher than last year's \u00a3509m. </p> <p>Mr Hughes said the group's problems in the French TV listings market, which account for an estimated 10% of Emap revenues, had stabilised after a torrid start to the year. The launch of two rival titles by Bertelsmann, the German media group, hit circulation at Emap's T\u00e9l\u00e9 Star and T\u00e9l\u00e9 Poche but Mr Hughes said the new entrants' sales were more modest now after a flying start. </p> <p>Emap's consumer division, its largest unit and home to magazines such as FHM and Heat, saw like-for-like turnover rise 6%, with the trade magazine arm rising 8%. The radio operation, which includes Kiss FM and the Magic network, saw revenue fall 3%, while the French unit was down 4%.</p>",
  "A terrified mother-of-two told a police telephone operator she had \"about one minute before I die\" moments before her estranged husband burst into her house and shot her dead, an inquest heard yesterday. <p>Julia Pemberton, 47, died after her husband, Alan, discovered her cowering in a cupboard, phoning for help. </p> <p>The 48-year-old financial adviser also shot dead his son William, 16, whose body was found on the driveway of their home in Hermitage, Berkshire, on November 18 last year. </p> <p>Pemberton then turned the gun on himself. </p> <p>In a 16-minute phone call to police, Mrs Pemberton described how her husband was getting closer and closer to the cupboard. The last words caught on tape before the line went dead are Pemberton calling his wife a \"fucking whore\". </p> <p>Members of the family, including the couple's daughter, Laura, wept as the transcript was read out by the Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford. Laura was studying at Cambridge University when the murders took place. </p> <p>The inquest at Reading civic centre heard that Mr Pemberton had recently moved in with his new partner, Penny Cook, in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. </p> <p>Ms Cook told the court how, after his death, she had found a farewell letter warning that he was to carry out a \"callous\" act and speaking of his \"overpowering\" need for revenge. </p> <p>She said Pemberton had told her that he had threatened to kill his wife when she told him she wanted a divorce. He also told her he had become obsessed by the fact that his wife had accused him of sexual abuse and by his sense of separation from his children. </p> <p>An extract from Pemberton's farewell letter read to the court by the coroner said: \"No one quite knows the grief and shock I have suffered as a result of the action of my darling wife, my need for revenge is overpowering, as I discussed I have become obsessed.\" </p> <p>Ms Cook said she began searching her house, which Pemberton had recently moved into, as soon as she heard about the shootings. She found the gun used for clay pigeon shooting had been removed, and the keys to the cabinet in which it was kept were nowhere to be seen. </p> <p>She later also found a copy of the Newbury Weekly News opened at a page containing a report about a West Berkshire man responsible for a triple shooting. </p> <p>The hearing learnt that Mrs Pemberton had become so afraid after \"years of abuse\" that she had handed in Pemberton's guns and kitchen knives to police for safe-keeping. She had also taken out an injunction against him. </p> <p>But she refused to move into a safe house and initially turned down an offer of a panic alarm, although she later had one installed. </p> <p>Mrs Pemberton's brother, Frank Mullane, attributed this refusal to a desire to give her children stability, but he said that she had become increasingly convinced she was going to be murdered by her husband. </p> <p>The inquest continues. </p> <p><b>'Oh my god help me'</b></p> <p>This is an edited transcript of the telephone call made by Julia Pemberton to a police operator on the night of November 18 2003 as her husband Alan arrived at the house with a shotgun. </p> <p><b> Julia</b> \"I'm on Slanting Hill, Hermitage, I've got an injunction. My husband's out there with a gun and my son's there.

  "Police in Zimbabwe arrested 48 women on a protest march against new legislation yesterday which they say will be used to restrict human rights organisations. <p>The members of Women of Zimbabwe Arise (Woza) had walked 250 miles from Bulawayo, the country's second-largest city, and were stopped just 19 miles from Harare, their destination. </p> <p>The organiser, Jenni Williams, said the marchers, and four men who volunteered to protect them as they slept by the roadside en route, were taken to Norton police station. </p> <p>A police spokesman, Assistant Commissioner Wayne Bvudzijena, told Zimbabwe state television that the women had been arrested for staging an illegal protest and would be charged under security laws. </p> <p>Mr Bvudzijena said the women initially claimed they were on a fundraising march for their church, but were found carrying placards with political messages. </p> <p>Ms Williams said the women began the 12-day march last week to raise money and awareness for human rights work at a time when Robert Mugabe's government had proposed a law to restrict human rights organisations. </p> <p>\"This was a march to protest against the government's plans to enact the NGO (non-governmental organisations) bill, which we all believe will be used as a repressive tool to ban and to control human rights work in Zimbabwe,\" said Ms Williams. </p> <p>The NGO bill seeks to ban foreign human rights groups and bar local advocacy groups from campaigning on \"issues of governance\". Mr Mugabe accuses Britain and other western powers of using NGOs to work against his government. </p> <p>Woza has become one of the most militant groups protesting at the government. The women, almost all black and churchgoers, have in the past protested at food shortages by banging empty pots and pans in the streets. </p> <p>Ms Williams said that, since the group was founded in 2002, at least 300 members have been arrested for what she called \"trivial issues\", such as handing out red roses symbolising peace on Valentine's day and calling for the lowering of food prices.</p>",
  "<p>A couple of years ago I was waiting in the West Wing of the White House to talk to President Bush about the post-9/11 world. The mission to overthrow Saddam Hussein was already on the administration's agenda. My head was full of thoughts about the meeting, but my assistant was looking distracted: an avid fan of television's The West Wing, she was comparing the real thing with the scenes from the programme. We were a few yards from the most powerful man on the planet but it was the world of Josiah Bartlet that was exciting her. </p> <p>Initially, most of my knowledge of The West Wing came second-hand from others, but in the past year I've had more time to enjoy it. In West Wing World everyone is glamorous. There's not a beer belly in sight. Even after a long night of speechwriting the shirts are barely crumpled; the stubble is rough but carefully ordered. Endless quantities of coffee are consumed but none is ever spilt on keyboards. The interns are as pretty as in Bill Clinton's dreams. Every speech is like the Gettysburg address. There is never a hair out of place - one of the few West Wing phenomena that I can match. </p> <p>Then there's perfectly manicured CJ Cregg, the president's press spokeswoman. Always elegant and calm, her effect on men of a certain age is electrifying.No need for an Alastair Campbell-like put-down for her (just imagine the scene: the press corps assembled, CJ stands at the podium, some hack makes an allegation, her retort: \"Bollocks on stilts\"!) No, no. Somehow you can't see it. </p> <p>Every politician would give his eye-teeth for some of that West Wing glamour in their team. Yet if I'd been visited by a political fairy godmother and offered one West Wing feature I know which one it would have been. Sam Seaborn's wordsmithery, Leo McGarry's crisis management skills and CJ's ability to charm the press pack would all have been tempting, but what I'd have taken from my political genie would have been The West Wing music score. When Bartlet has a difficult message for the American people his carefully scripted words are supported on a rising tide of rousing music: wonderful music that tugs at the heart strings. So powerful is the effect that frankly he could be reciting the telephone directory and you would be moved to tears. (Who knows, maybe that's what New Labour plan next.) </p> <p>Perhaps only in Hollywood could America be governed by someone so liberal. An American right-of-centre magazine ran a cover article that dubbed the Emmy-winning series The Left Wing. Series one was first beamed into America's living rooms in 1999, when Clinton was still president, and many of the characters were allegedly based on the Clinton White House. Rob Lowe's Sam Seaborn was said to be modelled on George Stephanopoulos; Allison Janney's CJ on Dee Dee Myers; and Stockard Channing's first lady on Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>The show's brilliant creator, Aaron Sorkin, is an active supporter and fundraiser for the Democrats. From the earliest episodes of series one, Bartlet was nominating the \"most liberal judge in the country\" to the supreme court and supporting reparations for the ancestors of enslaved black Americans. But the chances of Americans voting for his liberal policies are about as high as CJ becoming my press officer. Martin Sheen, who plays Bartlet, has clauses written into his contract that permit him to undertake political campaigning. This didn't prevent the series' ratings suffering when he campaigned against the Iraq war and was allegedly asked by Warner Bros to ease off. Equally, when he showed up at a rally for Howard Dean in Iowa, the then pro-war John Kerry bested the Vermont governor by 20%. </p> <p>One of The West Wing's weaknesses is a tendency to caricature: the only Brit to appear in it, Lord Marbury, is an upper-class, whisky-drinking, womanising, bow-tie-wearing eccentric; strangely, the only obese guy is the Republican Speaker of the House with the awkward name of Glenallen Walken; and surprise, surprise, the stupidest, meanest person we meet is Bartlet's Republican challenger - Governor Robert Ritchie. He is conservative, folksy and favours a tough approach to crime. Behind the scenes he's very unpleasant. \"All Republicans Are Mean Like This\" doesn't actually flash across the screen, but the viewer gets the idea. </p> <p>And yet, I enjoy the programme very much. I don't watch it for political re-education. Its agitprop has certainly failed on me. I enjoy The West Wing because of its intelligence, its pace, its interwoven plotlines; for its superb camerawork, magnificent sets, perfect casting and terrific humour. The last series may have lost some of the edge of the earlier ones, in the same way Friends and Frasier lost theirs by series 143. But like so much of American television, the writing is sharp and funny. From Sheen to Lowe the acting is Hollywood-class. The panoply of issues the series covers - war, kidnapping, abortion, gun control, poverty, women's rights, drug abuse, hate crimes - is as wide and fresh as the embrace of modern politics. </p> <p>But there's something deeper than all of these qualities. My guess is the real secret of The West Wing's success is the idealistic image it portrays of public life. From President Bartlet down, the West Wingers are always trying to do the right thing. Unlike the politicians impersonated by Rory Bremner or invented in Michael Dobbs' House of Cards, Josh, Toby, Sam, Charlie et al are good people. They really believe things can get better. They want to make a difference and in each episode they do. </p> <p>After being pounded by a cynical media in real life, with every politician cast as a pantomime villain, the public find in The West Wing a refreshing dose of optimism: compare the sunlit optimism of the West Wingers with the grey despondency of the EastEnders. The West Wing is almost Capra-esque in its optimism. When Sam exits the series he's replaced by Will Bailey. Will is an incurable idealist - perhaps named after the George Bailey of Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life. </p> <p>Progress has historically been an idea monopolised by liberals and has made drama - and its raw need for challenging of the status quo - a liberal medium. But I wonder if the times are a-changing. The left is now the defender of much of the status quo. It has built the one-size-fits-all welfare state of its dreams and enacted its criminal-is-the-victim-too beliefs into law. In America conservatives are the new idealists. Unhappy with the left's failed approaches to crime, welfare and international development, it is Giuliani in New York and Schwarzenegger in California who are the agents of change. Ironically, in The West Wing the most prominent African-American is the president's personal aide, Charlie. It takes a real-life Republican administration to appoint America's first black national security adviser and secretary of state. </p> <p>So, Bartlet is now in his second term and that means the end of his presidency is approaching and, probably, the end of the road for the programme. It would be interesting to see a Republican occupy TV's West Wing, but would Sorkin accept the contract? That possibility would be too optimistic even for The West Wing, I fear. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The new series of The West Wing is on E4 on Tuesdays at 9pm. The previous series is on Channel 4 on Fridays at 7.35pm.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Heaven and earth </strong><br> The battle to get the pope to endorse GM foods has been going on for years, and just won't go away. Last week, the US embassy to the Holy See sponsored a conference at the Vatican with the loaded title \"The Moral Imperative of Biotechnology\". After listening to many friends of the industry praising the technology, Jesuit priest Br David Andrews could not contain himself: \"Surely, among the structures of sin in the world today are agro-food corporations that steer the goods of the earth toward themselves solely for profit,\" he said. \"If one thinks that the focus of these multinational corporations and their supporters is to cure world hunger, then one is among the most naive on the planet.\" This was greeted with profound silence by the American bishops. </p> <p><strong> Empty promises </strong><br> The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have been celebrating their 60th birthdays, but they have received more than 10,000 signed \"unhappy birthday cards\" - sent by debt campaigners from 23 countries.

  "<p>Today the Labour conference turns its focus on to health. Successive Tory leaders have taunted Labour for allegedly failing to restructure the NHS. Nothing could be further from the truth. The challenge facing Labour is not that it has done too little to change the NHS, but that it has done too much. Multiple reforms are now bumping into each other, exposing goals which ministers clearly wished to keep out of the spotlight. </p> <p>The top of this list is the recent restricted order - subsequently leaked - sent down from on high to England's 300 primary care trusts (PCTs), which requires them to include one private provider among the choice of four or five hospitals that patients are going to be offered from the end of next year. </p> <p>This \"expectation\", that one of the five options must be from the private sector, is going to anger delegates on two separate fronts. First for the way it breaches ministerial commitments to devolving decisions in the NHS down to local level. Of all strategic changes made in the past seven years, none has been aired more publicly. </p> <p>The greatest centraliser in the history of the NHS, Alan Milburn, openly conceded his strategic mistake in April 2001, when he dramatically announced plans to transfer responsibility for 75% of the \u00a360bn NHS budget to locally-run PCTs. He penitently acknowledged that his command and control operation had left staff feeling \"disempowered\". All this was to change. His successor, John Reid, concurred with this new approach and even wrote a New Health Network pamphlet on why NHS devolution was necessary, even suggesting it was perhaps time to resurrect the old Labour tradition of local mutualism. </p> <p>Sceptics who have pointed to the central controls still applied through 28 strategic health authorities now have a glaring new example of how the old NHS dog is failing to learn the new tricks of devolution. Just how far short of understanding devolution the old dog is was demonstrated by the senior official who declared that PCTs would not be told which procedures should be commissioned from the private sector because \"it would be wrong to be prescriptive\". </p> <p>In the eyes of the NHS Alliance, which represents PCTs and GPs, telling local bodies that they have to involve the private sector is even more prescriptive. Dr Michael Dixon, its chairman, could not see the need to involve the private sector if local NHS providers were providing good quality services. David Hinchliffe, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons health select committee, agreed. </p> <p>One reason for the central instruction is a separate and less talked about goal of using competition to drive up efficiency in the NHS. There is nothing new about the NHS using spare capacity in the private sector to bring down hospital-patient waiting time - it has been going on for years. But Labour is now set on a different goal. It plans to increase the 2% of NHS elective surgery that the private sector currently carries out to 15%, eventually. Much of the initial increase will be achieved by 34 private treatment centres out of the 80 new centres that are being opened. They are being commissioned to carry out short-stay inpatient care, day-case surgery and diagnostic work. </p> <p>This is a second development delegates will not like. This is big business - 15% represents some 640,000 NHS procedures out of the current 4.26 million carried out annually - all of which is being done with little debate compared with the hours spent debating foundation hospitals. </p> <p>There are good reasons for setting up dedicated centres for elective surgery, uninterrupted by emergency work. Bringing in foreign firms to run 34 initially made sense with the NHS already at full stretch. But awkward questions remain unanswered: their potential to disrupt training programmes; their ultimate length of contracts; more serious still the effectiveness of injecting competition into the NHS. Simon Stevens, the previous Downing Street health adviser, saw a pragmatic need for more competition. His successor, Julian Le Grand, is an active proselytizer. </p> <p>None of this will go down well with the delegates in Brighton today. Yet there is a third and even more covert goal with respect to competition with which they would be more sympathetic: the need to get more work out of NHS surgeons who also carry out private practice. Currently, there is a perverse incentive for these doctors not to tackle waiting lists: the more people on the list, the more private practice is guaranteed. To their credit, ministers have sought to reduce these incentives while trying to avoid a head-on clash. </p> <p>Consider the case of orthopaedic surgeons who, even before the NHS plan was launched in 2000, had increased in numbers by 50% (from 678 to 1023) but this also coincided with a reduction in their productivity. This was not just to do with private practice, but it played a part. The NHS is riddled with variations in work rates. Orthopaedics has a threefold variation. Stories abound about cartels of consultants that have stopped managers recruiting more specialists because of the threat to private practice. This has to be stopped.</p>",
  "<p>Every change in the laws that have demeaned gay people - from an equal age of consent, to fairness in adoption - is cause for celebration. I can certainly say that looking across the House of Lords with Stonewall's parliamentary team as peers voted to despatch Section 28 last year was one of the most memorable moments of my life. </p> <p>For a campaigning generation of lesbians and gay men, these legislative changes represent the apex of an epic struggle. We're beginning to see the world they fought for. But that was how many people felt when the Sex Discrimination Act was introduced too. We shouldn't forget that, 30 years later, British women still earn 18% less than men. </p> <p>However dramatic our steps forward might seem, we're clear about one thing: changing the law, tough as it can be, is the easy part; now we have to get on and change the world. </p> <p>Britain might look like a gay-friendly society from the vantage point of central London, central Manchester or Brighton. That's not the experience of hundreds of thousands of its citizens. </p> <p>Ofsted reported two years ago that the most difficult forms of school bullying to tackle were racist and homophobic. Schools are now required to address racist bullying, yet at the last count just 6% had policies dealing with homophobic bullying. </p> <p>This sort of abuse, which has affected one in two gay pupils, leads to underachievement or truancy. </p> <p>Last week, the Metropolitan Police reported a 15% rise in the number of homophobic attacks in London. Some of this increase, happily, is due to reduced reluctance to report offences. However, far too much stems from the willingness of too many British citizens to assault and abuse others simply for the way they were born. </p> <p>Across the public sector, evidence is emerging of inferior service provision. The only reason this has taken so long to come to light is that many of these services still barely recognise the existence of gay people. </p> <p>We've come a long way. But if you're not lesbian or gay and you want to know just how far there still is to go, buy two T-shirts this weekend with a vivid gay slogan on them. Then walk along a High Street near you at closing time holding hands with a friend of the same sex. </p> <p>And please, do let me know what happens.</p>",

  "<p><strong> 'I thought all hell was going to break loose' </strong> <br> Allan Horsfall helped found what would become the Campaign for Homosexual Equality in 1964 <br> We started under the name of the North-Western Homosexual Law Reform Committee because the Homosexual Law Reform Society was seen as purely London based, driven by the Hampstead set. The trendsetters may well have been in London, but the blokes overwhelmingly were not. </p> <p>We happened to be located in Manchester, but it wouldn't have mattered if it had been Bristol or Newcastle; it just had to be somewhere away from London so people could see that we could push homosexual law reform forward in the provinces without the sky falling in. </p> <p>I was working for the National Coal Board at that time, and living in a house that belonged to the coal board in the middle of Atherton, a mining village in the south Lancashire coal field. I got our committee notepaper printed with my address and we launched our first leaflet, 10,000 copies, and sent it to social workers, gay groups, and to the press of course. </p> <p>The local paper ran a front page feature with a banner headline, and I thought all hell was going to break loose. Not a murmur. No letters opposing it, no hostility from neighbours, not much at work. I thought: \"Well, this really can't be as controversial as people are trying to make out.\" So we put more leaflets out, inviting people to support us. </p> <p>Denis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsolver, wrote in the New Statesman: \"Well, yes, reform might be very admirable, but no way will it go down in my constituency with the miners.\" So I replied, saying: \"Well, I'm publishing from the middle of a mining village, and I find it all right. I don't know what Skinner's on about.\" </p> <p>We tried to set up a social organisation called Esquire Clubs Limited. We almost got there in Burnley; we had lined up a lease on old assembly rooms in the centre of the town. We had enough money, and willing hands to do it up ourselves, but someone leaked it to BBC Blackburn. All hell broke loose. The church were after us; even the local doctors formed a committee to oppose it. We held a public meeting to try to explain our plans in Burnley public library in the town centre, and it was packed, priests getting up and bringing down hell fire on us, councillors, everyone. </p> <p>The police were so fearful of violence that they made teddy boys take their boots off outside and leave them on the lawn, so there was a line of boots on the lawn with lads going into the meeting in bare feet. Michael Steed, who was once president of the Liberal Party, said it was the greatest meeting he'd ever been to. But we got disheartened and CHE remained as a campaigning group. </p> <p>CHE peaked in the mid-70s, but then it began to lose its edge. The Gay Liberation Front was formed and people began to look on CHE as being too formal, too structured. </p> <p>Society as a whole has become more tolerant. But there is always an intolerant minority that can make life very difficult for you. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> From The Unsung Sixties, by Helene Curtis and Mimi Sanderson, published by Whiting and Birch. </p> <p><strong> 'HIV has forced the issue' </strong> <br> Nick Partridge is chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust <br> Rupert Whittaker, Terrence Higgins's partner, was refused details of how Terry died by the hospital consultant, who told him if he wanted to find out, he could read about it in the next edition of the Lancet. At the start of the [Aids] epidemic in the 1980s, when people didn't fully understand it, and because the partners of lesbians and gay men were not treated as family, it could be an extremely difficult experience dealing with health and social services. </p> <p>The position now is wholly different and, while there are still issues of equality yet to be resolved, there is no doubt that a great many professionals in health and social services have worked very hard, and shown incredible commitment to making changes. </p> <p>And there have been huge changes over the past 20 years in particular. Before HIV it was in many ways more difficult to be open about sexuality, but one of the biggest changes is that HIV has forced the issue. </p> <p>The clear response of lesbians and gay men to the early reactions to the epidemic began to show homosexuality in a different light. It showed the complexity of people's lives and moved the focus away from exclusively sexuality. </p> <p>HIV meant that models of social care had to be changed. Changes were patchy at first in the 1980s, but there is no doubt that a large number of people in social care and health wanted to make a difference. </p> <p>It is worth remembering though, as far as working in health and social services goes, that even now, very many lesbians and gay men are still not able to come out. I think there remains a question about how deeply rooted equality is and how much of it is still a veneer. </p> <p>There are still risks attached to being fully out. I think there is still a level of acceptability about, for instance, using terms that are verbal homophobia that, were the equivalent for racism used, just would not be tolerated. It can be deeply hurtful and stressful for anyone involved. There's still a long way to go. </p> <p><strong> 'Kids can be cruel and use offensive language'</strong> <br> Rob Frank, teacher, East Anglia <br> There's no way I'd ever come out directly to the school kids, but from my second interview for my current job I made it clear to staff that I was gay, and I got the job regardless. It's funny because a lot of the sixth-form girls are speculating if I'm gay. They might come up and say something like: \"Sir, are you gay?\", and I'll have to respond with something vague like: \"Would it matter if I was?\" </p> <p>It can be difficult if students see you in the street. I went to a protest against hate lyrics the other day and an ex-student was there and started saying things like, \"That's fucking disgusting\", and verbally abusing me. </p> <p>I haven't experienced homophobia in the staff room, but schools can feel like a very homophobic environment. I think it must be very hard for teachers who are unsure of their sexuality. The kids can be cruel and use offensive language. I see it as my duty to talk to them about how they use language and how offensive it can be. </p> <p>When the sex education expert came in to the school recently, he talked only about heterosexual sex. When I asked him why he avoids discussions about gay sex, he said the schools don't like it. </p> <p>It's awkward sometimes not being able to talk openly about being gay, even though colleagues know. I would like to be seen as a positive gay role model. Kids need them, but I don't think it's possible yet. I volunteer at a youth group for young gay people up to the age of 25. Our youngest member is 12 and his mum brings him along. This is all very encouraging, and I want to put something back because I had a lot of support when I was coming out. </p> <p>I'd like to see a time when homosexuality is not an issue. When I told some colleagues that I was going to do this interview, one said: \"No. Don't. It will be social suicide. At the very least, don't give your second name.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Rob Frank is a pseudonym</p> <p><strong> 'They quizzed me about why I wasn't married'</strong> <br> Michael Lloyd, 65, is a retired probation officer <br> Being gay was an issue I had to face right away in my career. When I was being interviewed at the Home Office about being trained for the job, they quizzed me about why I wasn't married. From that time on, it always felt like it would be an issue. </p> <p>I came out in the late 1970s, partly because otherwise it would mean living with a lie. It also happened because a group of gay men and lesbians [in the service] had got together and were tired of homophobia within the criminal justice system. </p> <p>The probation service has changed in many ways over the years, but most of the progress has been because Lagip [Lesbians and Gays in Probation] have forced it. The service now formally recognises individual sexuality in its equality policies. </p> <p>However, even now there are cases where people suffer prejudice, such as abusive letters or bullying. I'm not saying it's rife, but it's there. Managers should be given better training to deal with the situation. </p> <p>In the 1970s, everyone was very positive and optimistic. We all thought we could change the world. Then came the 1980s, and we hadn't quite expected Thatcherism and the Tory party view that homosexuality should not be talked about in school. In the long run, though, it did us good. People rallied together against Section 28. If you're not optimistic about the future, you just give up. </p> <p><strong> 'Apart from with friends, I hid my orientation'</strong> <br>Ray Rowden is a health policy analyst <br> As a sexually confused 17-year-old student nurse in the early 1970s, I worked out quickly that if you slept with boys you kept it very quiet. The hospital I worked at was rabidly homophobic, so, apart from with a few trusted friends, I hid my orientation. I got married at 20 (I have two stunning daughters), thinking that my gay side would somehow go away. Needless to say, it didn't. I came out in the late 1970s, when I was working for the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in Wales. Reactions were mixed, but I remember meeting many gay and lesbian nurses, particularly in rural areas, who had terrible fears of being found out. </p> <p>At the RCN in the early 1980s, I quickly realised the upper echelons of British nursing were awash with gays and lesbians. One year, at the RCN conference in Blackpool, I took a mixed group of friends to a gay club. It was full of senior nurses and they were horrified that I had brought straight people. Their fear of being seen in a gay club was palpable. Many were in the closet, and some were married. </p> <p>In 1986, I became an NHS manager in Lambeth, south London. Diversity was positively valued at Lambeth, which was way ahead of its time. Despite that, I remember being phoned by a terrified male nurse who had been charged by the police for cottaging. His managers suspended him and were threatening disciplinary action, even before his court appearance. I intervened, insisting on his reinstatement. He was a brilliant nurse, but his fears for his career were very real. In the end, he was cleared by magistrates. </p> <p>It's easier for gay and lesbian public servants to live in London or Manchester. But are things so easy for colleagues in large towns and rural areas, and across the rest of the UK? I doubt it. </p> <p><strong> 'It's far more difficult in the private sector'</strong> <br> Helen Dale, 57, is acting IT project manager at the National Probation Service. <br> I spent 30-odd years working in advertising and PR and was living as a male heterosexual. I was married and have a grown-up daughter. I've been working in the public sector as a woman for the past five years and I really believe it's the best environment for a transgendered person. It's far more difficult in the private sector. </p> <p>There is a lot of unemployment among transgendered people and although as a group they are a lot more visible, there is still a lot more to be done in terms of wider acceptability. My job for the probation service was the first job I ever applied for as a woman. Although colleagues in previous jobs were aware that I was considering living and working as a woman, I had been working as a man. </p> <p>The interview for the probation service was a real non-event actually. I think they take their equality and diversity policies really seriously. I had a meeting with the man who was to be my line manager after I was offered the job. He said: \"Right, let's think about how we handle this. Tell me how you would like to handle it.\" </p> <p>It was impressive. A few days after getting the job, the equality and diversity officer came round to see me at my flat with the diversity manual. Greater Manchester Probation Service have been first class. I'm not saying they are perfect, but in my view they take things seriously. </p> <p><strong> 'I had to live with rumour and innuendo'</strong> <br>Vic Codling, 55, is a retired police constable.<br> For 20 years, I didn't tell anyone in the police force that I was gay. When I joined Durham Constabulary in 1971 it was apparent I'd get the sack if anyone found out. I had to live with rumour and innuendo. When I walked into a room, the conversation would change. </p> <p>Ten years later, my sergeant asked a chief officer to fail me on my advance driving course because I was a \"poof\". The chief officer told me what he'd said. He was disgusted by the sergeant's attitude and passed me with merit. The chief office never ask me if I was gay, but said he could raise the sergeant's behaviour as a disciplinary issue. I didn't take it any further because I had no confidence in management. At that time, it was OK to be homophobic. </p> <p>A year later, a PC I was very friendly with who knew I was gay - he was the first one I told - was pulled in by an inspector and chief inspector who said \"in the interests of your career, keep away from Vic Codling. You know he's a poof?\" Shortly after, the PC transferred back to the Metropolitan police. His sergeant down there was openly gay, so I decided to shift the 290 miles. That was in 1986. But I still didn't come out for another five years, until when I was at Hendon police college, delivering diversity training. </p> <p>Although the Gay Police Association has members from every force - 2,000 in total - there are still forces where are no openly gay police. The Police Federation of England and Wales uses the words racism and sexism, but instead of the word homophobia it uses \"bullying\" or \"harassment\". Yet Tayside police have just invited myself, an openly gay man, to tell HR managers how the organisation can become more inclusive for gay employees. Five years ago, that would never have happened.\" </p> <p><strong> 'I still can't show open affection in the street' </strong> <br> Eric Thomas, 45, a benefits officer at the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea. <br> Recently, there was an incident with a client who came in to the benefits office where I work and he declared he \"didn't want the poof\" to deal with his case. I work in a very macho culture, but the whole team jumped to my defence. One colleague chal lenged the client and said if he didn't want to be dealt with by me then no one would be taking his case. </p> <p>On the whole, I get on with my colleagues, and if they overstep the mark with a joke I'll tell them. I feel secure at the council, though. It helps that, out of a staff of 61, there are four out gay men and three lesbians. </p> <p>London really is way ahead of the rest of the country. In Ipswich, where I worked before, being out wouldn't have been easy. I wouldn't have felt safe. There's a sense that you can still get your head kicked in for being gay in the provinces. </p> <p>I feel like I'm treated very well at Kensington and Chelsea. They have an old school \"conservative with a small c\" paternalistic attitude. </p> <p>The few years I spent at Westminster council, when I first came to London, were OK until the work I did was contracted out. Many things bothered me about the company. I went for an interview for promotion, and a colleague got the job (she deserved it; she was great) but when they explained to me why I hadn't, the interviewer said: \"Don't worry if you're thinking it had something to do with blonde hair and big tits, it didn't.\" That did it for me. </p> <p>Things are definitely better for lesbians and gay men than they were 20 or 30 years ago, but so much more needs to be done. I still can't walk in the street and show open affection for my partner without a fear of abuse. That's wrong. </p> <p><strong> 'Banter was about what they did to their wives'</strong> Stewart Brown is a firefighter in Glasgow <br> \"So, have you got something to tell us?\" That was the question that greeted me when I returned from holiday. It was asked in a lighthearted way. I realised then that while I'd been away they'd watched me on TV in the final of Mr Gay UK. They were shocked. Some were positive about it but some of the older guys didn't feel comfortable. My station officer couldn't handle it. He just ignored it; he didn't want to deal with it. </p> <p>Very soon the whole of Strathclyde found out I was gay. When I got sent to other stations, there was an atmosphere. I had to go through fear each time about how they would react. </p> <p>I've not suffered any real discrimination since I joined at the age of 19, but being gay has hampered my career. I was fearful of promotion because I would have to move stations and I wasn't strong enough to deal with people's attitudes. Some nights I'd feel very depressed. All the banter was about what they did to their wives the night before. I know of a lot of firefighters who have been on the brink of suicide or left because of harassment. </p> <p>Through a union rep, I found out about a support group being set up in 1994. We started telling our stories of being gay firefighters at equality seminars around the country for Fire Brigades Union members. In Northern Ireland, they asked if I had my own breathing apparatus, my own cutlery, my own bedding? Did I go to bed first? </p> <p>You're still not going to walk in to a station and say you're gay, but the culture is changing. We've got 250 firefighters on the support group's database. </p> <p>A large percentage of women who are joining the fire service are lesbian. In many ways, it's easier for them. They fancy women - they're one of the boys. </p> <p><strong> 'I feel much safer at work than out and about' </strong> <br> Dean Brewster, 35, is a community support worker in Rotherham <br> For three-quarters of my working life I was in the closet. For 10 years, I was married and I have three children, so it was extremely difficult coming out. It is also hard in Rotherham and south Yorkshire in general. There is no gay scene and there is still a lack of tolerance of gay people. </p> <p>I've worked for Rotherham social services for 17 years, starting as a residential care worker. It has been very hard at times. I've suffered from depression and had to take Prozac. It was so stressful: like wearing three different faces - one for work, one for home, one for when I went out. </p> <p>After I told my parents and family I was gay, I came out at work. I took the opportunity when I was moving jobs because it would be a new bunch of people. There are other gay people in social services who have not come out. People do things in their own time, but I'd like to be seen as a role model of a gay person at work who is happy with being out. </p> <p>Most councils are equal opportunities employers and gay people are now more protected than ever at work because of the new laws. But, even with this, some people are still homophobic. You can tell from the way they look and the way they talk. </p> <p>The council has been very good to me, but I still live with pressures and I've had a number of homophobic incidents near my home. I feel much safer in work than I do out and about. I feel more looked after. </p> <p><strong> 'We need to become accepted exceptions'</strong> <br> Marion Janner is director of Bright, a specialist charity that offers other charities help with public relations and communication.<br> My partner and I were part of the pioneering first wave of lesbian and gay foster carers and adopters. We fostered Eddie, a boy with learning difficulties for five years and still see him 18 years on. Given that a lot of gay and lesbian couples were looking after kids with learning difficulties or other special needs, some people were saying it was second-rate couples looking after second-rate kids, but I think that was just their own prejudices coming out. </p> <p>At the time, we were worried about being seen as \"contaminating\" or \"tainting\" him. Though I'm a feminist, we made sure he had traditional boys' toys. There was always that fear that we would be pilloried by the press as perverting children. Luckily, it didn't happen. Eddie's mother was initially concerned that he would be spending the weekend with a lesbian couple, but the social worker was brilliant, got us all to meet up, and as soon as we met and got to know each other it was fine. </p> <p>I came out 22 years ago when I was working for Community Service Volunteers. There wasn't a hint of hostility. There was anything from acceptance to total indifference, despite the fact that I was an angry, crop-haired dyke with radical lesbian politics. </p> <p>But society has to move from tolerance to indifference so that we are the same as everyone else. We need to become accepted exceptions. </p> <p><strong> 'GLF was so noisy it drowned out others'</strong> <br> Martin Stafford was a teacher and a member of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality. He made a speech at a gay rally in Glasgow in 1973 in protest at radical gay activism. <br> The meeting was about whether homosexuals should integrate into society rather than fight against it. My argument was that we wanted greater recognition and integration. This was the time when the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was starting out. They believed that the prejudice against homosexuals was so great and deep-rooted that the only way to beat it was to overthrow capitalism, abolish marriage and end the concept of the family - very revolutionary and radical, but naive nonsense. </p> <p>The problem was the the GLF was so noisy and so radical that it drowned out the voice of others within CHE, and CHE itself seemed to tolerate this. I think the GLF's attitude dissuaded a lot of moderate people from coming out for fear of being branded as some sort of subversive anarchist. The GLF also gave so much ammunition to hardline opponents of any decriminalisation of homosexuality. </p> <p>The funny thing is that the things we campaigned for 30 years ago, acceptance and being able to have recognised relationships, are the things gay groups want now. They want to be able to marry - totally at odds with the sort of things the GLF was saying then.</p>",
  "<p>Housing may never again assume the commanding position of the 1950s and 1960s, when Tories and Labour outbid each other to build hundreds of thousands of homes in record time. But John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, would like to think it is edging towards the top of the government's agenda. \"He's convinced Tony Blair we have to give the issue much higher priority,\" said one official close to Prescott. </p> <p>The challenge is to balance the needs of low wage earners desperately seeking rented accommodation, particularly in London and the greater south-east, with the aspirations of younger people trying in vain to buy an affordable home. Eight months before a likely general election, Prescott knows that promises of 200,000 extra homes in the 40-mile Thames Gateway corridor and three other southern growth areas is not enough. He is desperate for evidence, in bricks and mortar, that low-cost housing is taking shape in marginal southern constituencies. </p> <p>This is a delicate balancing act. The deputy prime minister has to appeal both to middle-England, and to party activists wedded to the concept of the council as the pre-eminent social landlord. He also has to make clear to Cabinet modernisers - such as the newly-returned Alan Milburn - that wheezes to sell off more social homes will do little to widen home ownership for the masses. </p> <p>Over the past week, Prescott has been making clear that something much more radical is needed in both social and private housing: driving prices down by providing cheaper land from state assets; bullying developers to cut costs for social homes; and, in effect, restructuring the housing association movement mergers to cut out wasteful duplication and achieve economies of scale. He now believes he has the ear of the prime minister. </p> <p>Whether the PM sees this as a key issue, behind health and education, is another matter. But hours before Labour's conference opened earlier this week, he volunteered the importance of housing by promising more help to first-time buyers who were \"having a really tough time in the housing market, particularly in the south\". If that was re-stating the obvious, Prescott's speech on the opening day could be taken as a policy shift in another direction. He promised councils given an \"excellent\" Audit Commission rating a \"new deal on housing\", with the chance to build homes for the first time in 20 years. He also said they could bid for \u00a3500m of private finance initiative (PFI) credits for new properties for rent and for sale. Later, it became clear that any new deal would probably only be undertaken in partnership with private developers. </p> <p>It was Prescott's way of deflecting criticism from unions and activists who want a restoration of town hall powers to borrow money for updating houses without having to hive off stock to either a housing association or an arm's length management organisation (ALMO). Although the deputy prime minister was heavily defeated, and visibly annoyed, a colleague observed later that the conference vote would make little difference in reality. \"There can be no going back,\" he made clear. </p> <p>Prescott has little time to lose. He is becoming frustrated by both the slow pace of building and the \"unacceptable\" costs of new housing association homes. Why, he asked the National Housing Federation conference last week, has the price of building subsidised homes for rent risen by 60 per cent since 1997? Why has the average subsidy going into each housing association unit more than doubled to \u00a366,000 in seven years? Why were land prices rising by 15 per cent annually? In France and Italy, he railed, building costs had risen by less than inflation, while Scotland managed to spend a quarter less on construction than England. </p> <p>Cages are being rattled. Under the new chief executive of the Housing Corporation, Jon Rouse, an ally of Prescott, associations will be in for a much tougher time. \"I don't want to play the numbers game,\" Prescott said. \"But in some areas there are as many as 50 to 70 housing associations: sometimes there can be half a dozen in one street. Each with their own offices, their own maintenance, their own management. Is this really the best way to do things?\" </p> <p>Then there's the vexed question of salaries for association \"fat cats\". Quite ludicrous, says Prescott, that some should be paid more than the prime minister, with the top chief executive on \u00a3210,000, and a basic salary of \u00a3100,000 annually becoming the norm (according to a survey last week by Inside Housing magazine). </p> <p>By 2008, Prescott wants efficiency savings of \u00a3830m a year. But new housing legislation will also give him the power to spread cash for social housing, previously the preserve of associations, to private developers and - as he indicated to Labour's conference this week - to local councils. Exactly where all the \u00a33.3bn due for the Corporation in 2006 (to finance around 67,000 homes) will go is anyone's guess. But there's no doubt the social market will be opened up to much greater competition from a variety of providers. </p> <p>But that is not the end of Prescott's problems. He has probably won the argument with Alan Milburn, the newly installed general election strategist, over extending the right-to-buy to housing association properties. The deputy prime minister's home ownership task force last year comprehensively rubbished the heavily discounted sale of public housing stock - a \u00a319bn \"disinvestment\", according to Prescott - as failing to achieve the objective of widening ownership among the young. While 1.7m homes were hived off, it is now clear that many who bought did not need a discount on homes often sold for around \u00a350,000. </p> <p>In an attempt to widen home ownership, Prescott has gone for the headline-grabbing idea of trying to provide the \u00a360,000 house; quite a feat, when the average price for the first-time buyer in London is now \u00a3218,000. His idea is to assemble publicly-owned land - perhaps in the hands of health trusts, the Ministry of Defence, or local councils - and hand it to developers, with the state holding the freehold, on the promise that they will build cut-price homes. English Partnerships, the government regeneration company, has been asked to run a competition among British and European builders to take the idea forward. Wishful thinking? Perhaps. But, after all, an election is looming.</p>",
  "<p>Twelve months ago, Mr Blair went to Bournemouth to face the first Labour conference since the invasion of Iraq, with large sections of his party ranged against him on the war and on foundation hospitals. His response culminated in possibly the worst single line he has ever delivered: \"I have not got a reverse gear.\" The speech, widely praised at the time for its bold tone, was in fact a big failure - a useful reminder of the iron law that says the initial journalistic consensus on any party conference speech is almost always wrong. The Bournemouth speech triggered Mr Blair's worst year as prime minister, deepened the wounds over Iraq, sent his reputation for trust into a nose-dive and propelled his reputation for inflexibility skywards. </p> <p>In Brighton yesterday Mr Blair was confronted with many of the same challenges that he faced in 2003. Iraq is still an open wound. Public service reform is still controversial. The prime minister's response, however, was strikingly different this time. Mr Blair scaled back the rhetoric, cut down on the moral certainty and went out of his way not to rub the party's face in it. Anyone reading the speech with care will notice that relatively little ground was conceded. But it was Mr Blair in a new voice. Though not a flat speech like the one he delivered to the TUC at the start of the month, this was low-key, conversational and reasoned. Hectoring was out. Humility, perhaps even of the genuine variety, was in. The stylistic contrast with Gordon Brown was remarked. Mr Blair, like Charles Kennedy last week, reminded us that he is a communicator for the television age, a man who wants to hold the attention of the front-room audience. He spoke to the whole nation, calmly and in a grown-up way. It was big tent stuff, the inclusiveness extending to warm tributes, possibly sincere, to Mr Brown and to Ken Livingstone. It was a welcome change of tone. If it proves to have been more effective that the preacherly style of the past, then Mr Blair needs to learn the right lesson. The loudest music is not always the most satisfying. Rational exposition does not just get you out of a hole. It is the key to winning political respect and perhaps even trust. </p> <p>Mr Blair had promised a policy-rich speech and obliged with one. With a historic third term in his sights, his first pri ority was to come up with a compelling political offer to the \"hard-working families\" who have been at the heart of Labour rhetoric this week. His 10-point plan bombarded these Labour voters with pledges and goals in all the important domestic policy areas. The economy, skills, schools and hospitals came first, as they always do and must. But they were followed by other subjects which Labour believes can be turned into election winners, too: child care, pensions, science, law and order, asylum law and - of crucial importance to the unions delegations in the conference hall - rights at work. It was an impressive list, though, at first sight, many of the themes and promises had a familiar feel. Genuinely new and previously unannounced measures were a little hard to pin down. Until we get further announcements and manifesto details, it remains possible that Mr Blair was indulging in a piece of clever rebundling of the sort from which post-Campbell Labour was supposed to have moved on. But in a single speech Mr Blair at least managed to sideline the sterile theological dispute about whether Labour should put more emphasis on its past achievements (for which read Gordon Brown's agenda) or its future plans (for which read Alan Milburn's). The truth is that both always matter and both are always connected. The important thing is the sense of momentum. </p> <p>The prime minister's long-awaited apology on Iraq, as far as it went, was a rightly well-received milestone in his fragile rehabilitation with his critics. Mr Blair's logic in this obviously carefully argued and much scrutinised passage was pretty startling. As so often, he elided 9/11 with Iraq with Afghanistan with Saudi Arabia with international terrorism in ways which, at best, are not convincingly consistent with the facts. There was a hint, again not for the first time, of stirring progress (significantly, \"after November\") in the Middle East. But the guarded apology and the honest admission of fallibility were important signals nonetheless. Mr Blair could have chosen to confront, as he has so often done in the past. Instead he elected to converse. He could have shown defiance. Instead he offered dialogue. Time alone will tell whether this was simply a clever and polished performance or a genuinely new style of leadership.</p>",
  "Tony Blair is not exactly the Madonna of British politics, constantly reinventing himself. He may have grown older and greyer, but otherwise he has remained remarkably consistent. As he told the Labour conference in Brighton: \"I don't think as a human being, as a family man, I've changed at all.\" <p>Yet yesterday he presented a different Tony Blair to his party and the wider world, one altered by events and experience. He even announced the shift: \"I have changed as a leader.\" </p> <p>In the heady days of the 1990s, either on the eve of power or in the first blush of it, Blair would come on as a wide-eyed optimist, bursting with boundless self-confidence. This was the era of Britain as a \"young country\" or else a \"beacon to the world\". As one close colleague put it yesterday, Blair was in his JFK period. </p> <p>Yesterday that brimming, almost aggressive certainty was either gone or artfully concealed. Instead the prime minister displayed an unfamiliar trait: humility. </p> <p>As if bowing his head before the party brethren he so often used to scold, he made a remarkable admission - confessing that he and his decisions on foreign policy were the source of \"the problem of trust\" now afflicting the government.</p> <p>Then he uttered two sentences that must have caused physical pain to his throat: \"The evidence about Saddam having actual biological and chemical weapons, as opposed to the capability to develop them, has turned out to be wrong. I acknowledge that and accept it.\" </p> <p>That brought some unscripted applause, a sense of relief that at last he had said what so many had longed to hear. </p> <p>He didn't give the full \"sorry,\" but like the liberal parent who does not demand complete humiliation from a remorseful child, the Labour tribe took what they could get. The language was lawyerly - \"I can apologise for the information that turned out to be wrong,\" he said, rather than I do apologise - but he seemed to get away with it. An almost-apology was good enough. </p> <p>The key was in the tone; not the words, but the music of the speech. Blair did not bang the podium, laying down the law to his party - the default position of old. Rather, he sought sympathy. People had seen him \"struggling with\" the dilemma of Iraq. It had been \"hard\" and he had worked desperately to find a way out. \"There has been no third way this time. Believe me, I looked for it.\" </p> <p>It was all a long way from the dogmatic assertiveness on show as recently last year, when Blair told his troops: \"I've not got a reverse gear.\" There were no such Thatcheresque declarations yesterday. Instead he soliloquised his self-doubt. \"Do I know I'm right? ... I'm like any other human being, as fallible and as capable of being wrong.\" </p> <p>He could hardly have gone much further. A full mea culpa, an admission that he had made a historic error in Iraq, would have sounded like a resignation speech. But he could not have done much less either. Anti-war sentiment is sufficiently strong, in Brighton and beyond, that a defiant \"I was right and you're all wrong\" might have turned a mood into a movement.</p> <p>So Blair probably struck the right tone, somewhere in between. And for that moment, in the hall, it seemed to work. When a lone anti-war protester heckled, he received no backing. Cheers were reserved for the PM's put-down.</p> <p>The substance, though, was a different matter. As critics re-read the crucial passages, they may find them less and less convincing. In admittedly elegant fashion, the prime minister repeated the subliminal connection between 9/11 and Iraq - even though no evidence links them. He posed a series of false distinctions, attributing to his critics a view none of them actually hold. He said, for example, that his opponents believed terrorism did not pose a new threat, but rather amounted to a series of acts by individual extremists. These same critics imagined \"the terrorists are in Iraq to liberate it\". This was straw man politics, knocking down an enemy that does not exist. </p> <p>Equally, one of his biggest applause lines was his promise - \"after November\" and the US election - to make the Middle East peace process a personal priority. No one could be against that. </p> <p>But a moment's reflection stirred sceptical thoughts. Wasn't he supposed to have won movement on this from George Bush already, in return for London's dogged support on Iraq? Indeed, hadn't Blair promised \"final status\" Palestinian-Israeli talks by Christmas in his conference speech of 2002 - a commitment that led precisely nowhere? In other words, there were some skilful debating moves yesterday but hardly an argument built to last. Few of those who have opposed the PM on foreign policy grounds for nearly two years are likely to have been won over. </p> <p>The other four-fifths of the speech put him where he has long wanted to be, back on the domestic agenda. The new humility did the trick nicely in this sphere, too. He was no longer hectoring the Labour party, but setting out a \"mission\" for the third term which they could join with enthusiasm. Some found Blair's packed 10-point programme a tad too detailed, too many policies to take in. But that may have been deliberate. Some of the PM's internal enemies charge that he has run out of ideas, that he has no vision for the third term. This was his response, opening up a cupboard that spills out schemes and plans. </p> <p>If it was boring, it was deliberately, reassuringly boring: Look how many ideas I have up my sleeve! Some were familiar, others will excite - the plans for univer sal childcare among them. The cumulative effect was to realise the extent Labour dominates the domestic landscape. Blair felt no need to address the Conservative view on these questions, as if they have no view worth addressing. If it wasn't for Iraq, one suspects, Labour's command of British politics would be total and unprecedented. </p> <p>In these passages Kremlinologists could divine a few tilts within the titanic Blair-Brown struggle. The PM came out clearly for \"choice\" in public services - a word the chancellor had avoided in his own speech on Monday. He also referred to a national \"consensus\" on Labour policies. The Brownite fear is that that consensus has not yet been established, so there was a whiff of rebuttal here, too.</p> <p>But these were mere details. Mainly Brighton gave a warm, if not wild, embrace to a leader who many assumed would either be gone or in deep peril by now.</p> <p>He did what he had to do, ticking every box in workmanlike fashion. He returned to bread-and-butter politics and showed a humbler face. The cheers and ovations may have been encouraged (if not stage managed), but the final impression was of a leader who is not about to be removed in a party coup. </p> <p>Still, that was yesterday. How long the \"healing\", as Blair called it, lasts is a different question. Tellingly, there was no standout line from the speech, a phrase that will be quoted and requoted. This may be an address that did its job on the day - but will not last much longer.</p>",
  "<p>Fashion house Gucci more than doubled its operating profit in the second quarter thanks to higher sales and narrower losses from its Yves Saint Laurent brand. The figures were further evidence of the resilience of the luxury goods sector. </p> <p>Gucci, which was brought under the control of retailer Pinault Printemps Redoute this year, reported earnings before interest and tax of \u20ac65m (\u00a344m) for the three months to the end of July, up from \u20ac26.8m for the same period last year. </p> <p>Gucci's strong performance echoes that of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods company, which beat forecasts for first-half earnings this month. </p> <p>\"These are very good second quarter results. Clearly, Gucci are on track to meet full-year result expectations,\" Fraser Ramzan, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said. </p> <p>Gucci said sales rose 30.5% in Asia-Pacific markets excluding Japan which was up 6.5%. US sales came in 18% higher and in Europe they rose 13.8% year on year during the period.</p>",
  "Tony Blair showed some contrition yesterday when he stood before the Labour conference and offered a qualified apology for the Iraq war designed to reach out to voters enraged by the conflict. <p>In a marked change of tone, after taunting critics with a warning that they would have to \"eat their words\", the prime minister apologised for faulty intelligence on weapons of mass destruction but refused to express regret for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>As delegates listened in complete silence, the prime minister said he wanted to deal with Iraq \"head on\". Insisting that the \"whole international community\" had agreed Saddam possessed banned weapons in the run-up to war, Mr Blair then delivered his carefully phrased apology. </p> <p>\"The problem is I can apologise for the information that turned out to be wrong, but I can't, sincerely at least, apologise for removing Saddam,\" he said. \"The world is a better place with Saddam in prison not in power.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair's words did not go any further than his recent remarks owning up to mistakes in Iraq. But one cabinet minister said yesterday's speech was designed to launch a \"conversation\" with opponents of the war by addressing in detail their anxieties. </p> <p>Declaring that he understood people's anger, Mr Blair said: \"At the heart of this is a belief that the basic judgment I have made since September 11, including on Iraq, is wrong, that by our actions we have made matters worse not better.\" </p> <p>He then asked: \"Do I know I'm right?\" A year after declaring to the US Congress that history would prove him right over Iraq, Mr Blair shied away from answering yes to his own question: \"Judgments aren't the same as facts. Instinct is not science. I'm like any other human being, as fallible and as capable of being wrong. I only know what I believe.\" </p> <p>But he insisted that action had to be taken against the \"new phenomenon\" of global terrorism as he dismissed critics who believed that al-Qaida would \"wither\" if not provoked. Indicating he had revised his view of Islamist terrorism, which he initially blamed on a lethal but minuscule minority, Mr Blair warned that al-Qaida and its associates held sway in substantial parts of the world. </p> <p>\"This is a wholly new phenomenon, worldwide global terrorism based on a perversion of the true, peaceful and honourable faith of Islam... Its roots are not superficial but deep, in the madrasas of Pakistan, in the extreme forms of Wahabi doctrine in Saudi Arabia, in the training camps of al-Qaida in Afghanistan.\" </p> <p>In remarks that came close to echoing Silvio Berlusconi's notorious warning of a clash of civilisations, Mr Blair declared that it was impossible to reason with such Islamists. \"They are not provoked by our actions but by our existence.\" </p> <p>But he pledged to champion the Middle East peace process after the US elections. For the third time in four annual conferences he talked of the need for progress towards peace. </p> <p>Mr Blair will return to the subject of Iraq today when he joins forces with Jack Straw to try to persuade the \"Big Four\" union leaders, who control 40% of the votes on the floor, to oppose a critical motion on the issue. Amid accusations of dirty tricks to prevent the conference debating a call for the \"early\" withdrawal of troops, the foreign secretary claimed it would be illegal to leave Iraq before December 2005. </p> <p>The critical composite is due to be moved tomorrow by the Regent's Park and Kensington local party in London. Earlier yesterday it was in danger of being blocked by the Labour leadership after a change of mind by the delegate from Walthamstow, north London, who agreed to second it. Anti-war campaigners said \"intolerable\" pressure had been put on the young delegate who was summoned to a meeting with Mr Straw. </p> <p>But last night it was clear the debate would go ahead, with No 10 not wanting to be accused of having the motion ruled out on a technicality. </p> <p>Three of the Big Four - Unison, T&amp;G and GMB - were holding firm last night over setting a date for early withdrawal but there were signs that Amicus was wavering. </p> <p>Derek Simpson, the Amicus general secretary, said: \"If the leadership is defeated the positive note of this conference may be lost on the war.\"</p>",
  "<p>Expectation has been drained from Liverpool's continental campaign. The memory of their mesmerising opening victory over Monaco in Group A was obliterated in Greece last night, lost in the trauma of a defeat far more emphatic than the scoreline suggests. Rafael Ben\u00edtez regularly pleads for time; on this evidence he will need it. </p> <p>This was a painful reality check in Piraeus. Olympiakos dismissed Liverpool with ease, the visitors' lacklustre display drowned amid a joyous cacophony at the final whistle. Liverpool were bullied in the air, embarrassed on the turf and appeared to lack the strong-arm spirit to revive, their zip still elusive when necessity demanded a more urgent approach late on. </p> <p>This was Liverpool's first defeat on Greek soil but, more significantly, it provided Ben\u00edtez with another insight into the onerous task he has undertaken. Only Manchester United, twice, and Juventus have prevailed in these parts at Olympiakos's expense in 23 games among the elite. The Spaniard's former club, Valencia, might have flourished here; Liverpool floundered. </p> <p>\"We lost possession too easily, particularly in the first half,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"We never kept the ball.\" That is becoming a troublingly familiar trait away, where Liverpool's form has been too insipid for comfort to date, the slick passes at Anfield often lost in an incoherent mishmash. There was to be no exception here. The home goalkeeper Antonios Nikopolidis barely had a save to make, with Liverpool utterly unable to rouse themselves even after Anastasios Pantos had been dismissed for two bookings. </p> <p>Instead, Liverpool players bickered among themselves as they departed the scene in the raucous din, frustration nagging at them as acrid flare smoke rolled across the arena. Ieroklis Stoltidis had headed against the crossbar and Stylianos Venetidis, meandering through a shambolic offside trap, had dragged a shot wastefully wide even in the six minutes Liverpool held a numerical advantage. That told its own story of the Premiership side's inadequacies. </p> <p>Even Xabi Alonso, normally imperious, was made to look mediocre in the home side's onslaught, Liverpool gasping for breath amid rampant early Greek attacks. Only when the home players opted to crumple to the turf under the vaguest hint of a challenge - something they did shamelessly and regularly - did Liverpool find any respite, though it was through a set piece that Olympiakos took their goal. </p> <p>It was Rivaldo who regularly prompted the panic. The 32-year-old wears No5 these days and the consensus is that he is half the player he was when, as Brazil's No10, he helped inspire them to the World Cup two years ago. Yet from set plays his class still shines through. There was a reverse flick at the kick-off to set the tone, a blistering volley from distance which burst beyond Jerzy Dudek but wide of a post, before he ambled, bandy-legged, up for a succession of free-kicks near Liverpool's penalty area. </p> <p>From one - Stephen Warnock having apparently obstructed Dimitrios Mavrogenidis - Rivaldo's centre flicked off Milan Baros, barely 10 yards from the Brazilian, to veer awkwardly into the area. Dudek and his defenders were too static to repel the threat. Sami Hyypia was flummoxed by the deflection and Stoltidis, leaping on the penalty spot, flicked the loose ball home. Ben\u00edtez, who saw his side concede twice from set pieces at United last week, was apoplectic on the bench. </p> <p>His mood must have been black already. Stoltidis, freed by Ioannis Okkas early on, forced Dudek to touch a shot on to his near post. By half-time the Brazilian Giovanni and Pantelis Kafes should both have converted close-range headers as Liverpool wilted. The nearest they came to a riposte was Baros's pass which slipped the substitute Harry Kewell in on goal, only for a linesman to choke the Australian's attempt before the goalkeeper could. </p> <p>Improvement will be needed against Ben\u00edtez's compatriots Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a in back-to-back fixtures to come, and the quicker Liverpool can put this ignominy behind them the better. Olympiakos's delight was unconfined; after their success at Euro 2004, Greek football has never enjoyed days as heady as these.</p>",
  "<p>The Manchester United fans who last night serenaded Wayne Rooney's remarkable debut, tongues firmly in cheeks, with chants of \"What a waste of money\" missed the point in the name of parochial point-scoring. </p> <p>\"Are you watching, Merseyside?\" they asked as his first, second and third goals in a United shirt entered the history books. Beyond Merseyside - certainly as far as north and west London and, presumably, throughout European football - Rooney's hat-trick will have been greeted with astonishment and no small amount of trepidation. </p> <p>\"Potential\" has been the most overused word bandied at Sir Alex Ferguson's press conferences since effectively he accounted for his transfer budget for this season, and the first half of next, by signing Rooney. It promises to remain so for some time where the 18-year-old is concerned but, even if Rooney has already fulfilled that potential, even possibly peaked, the \u00a327m invested looks a steal. </p> <p>Last night, and inevitably given his CV to date, Rooney displayed his sense and feel for the occasion. Just as he did in his fledgling days with Everton and as he has done time and again for the national team, he would seize the day, illustrate why Ferguson and, before him, Everton's David Moyes, have spoken about the youngster's maturity. </p> <p>Off the field, the jury is still out on Rooney's ability to handle the burden of being a multimillionaire teenage footballer from an inner-city council estate. On it, there is no doubt he has the physical and mental wherewithal to thrive on such pressure. </p> <p>Early on he played a nice one-two with David Bellion, contemptuously coped with two crunching tackles from Fabio Luciano and, after coming short to collect a Kleberson pass, proved such an imposing object to tackle that Deniz Baris injured himself in doing so. </p> <p>It took all of 14 minutes for Rooney to play himself in. Not for the first - nor last - time on the night he chased a Ruud van Nistelrooy touch, shrugged off Umit Ozat's attentions as if he were an irritating paparazzo, rounded Rustu Recber and cleared the bar, left-footed, from a tight angle. It was the closest thing to failure he would meet all night. </p> <p>After 17 minutes, Rooney scored his first goal in United colours, a finish that was nowhere near as routine as he made it appear from a superb pass which, similarly, Van Nistelrooy made appear ludicrously easy. After 28 minutes, the finish was even better, the goal of a more individual nature, as he used his power and native football wit to create half a yard and the necessary space to fire home an unstoppable 20-yard shot. </p> <p>One for the statisticians: after averaging one goal every 116 minutes for England and one every 268 minutes in the Premiership, his United career had opened with one every 14 minutes in the Champions League, before falling to a more modest one in 30. </p> <p>But first he would offer evidence of fallibility, shooting wide from a Gary Neville cross before the interval. After it, he must have had Roy of the Rovers looking up the number of his copyright lawyers. </p> <p>The 54th minute saw Luciano penalised for a push on Van Nistelrooy and Rooney, hovering ominously over the dead ball just outside the area, was poised to dispense justice. Fenerbahce knew what was coming, a capacity crowd knew what was coming and Rooney, scoring right-footed, most certainly knew what was coming. </p> <p>In Michael Jordan's years as the most dominant player basketball has known, it was said the opposition could not stop him, they could only hope to contain him. On the evidence of his first outing as a United player, it was impossible to imagine any team ever containing Wayne Rooney. </p> <p><strong>Notable hat-tricks on debut</strong></p> <p><strong> Tommy Lawton </strong> </p> <p><strong>Burnley 1935</strong> </p> <p>Lawton scored a hat-trick on debut at the age of 16, the first goal against Spurs coming within 30 seconds. </p> <p> <strong> Jimmy Greaves </strong> </p> <p><strong>Tottenham 1961</strong> </p> <p>The prolific England striker scored a hat-trick against Blackpool on his debut for Spurs when he returned to England after a spell with Torino. </p> <p><strong> Alan Shearer</strong> </p> <p><strong>Southampton 1988</strong> </p> <p>The future England captain scored three goals against Arsenal in a 4-2 win at the Dell on his first full cap for the Saints. </p> <p><strong> Tony Cottee </strong> </p> <p><strong>Everton 1988</strong> </p> <p>After a \u00a32m move from West Ham he marked his debut against Newcastle with a hat-trick. He struck his first after 34 seconds. </p> <p><strong> Ian Wright </strong> </p> <p><strong>Arsenal 1991</strong> </p> <p>Wright scored on his Arsenal debut in the League Cup against Leicester and three days later made his league debut and scored a hat-trick against Southampton. </p> <p><strong> Fabrizio Ravanelli</strong> </p> <p><strong>Middlesbrough 1997</strong> </p> <p>The White Feather was signed for \u00a37m from Juventus and scored a hat-trick on his Boro debut against Liverpool.</p>",
  "<p>Even by Wayne Rooney's standards of defying all reasonable expectations his first appearance for Manchester United will go down in the club's annals as the most impressive debut that Old Trafford has ever witnessed. </p> <p>He did not quite manage to silence the boisterous Turkish supporters but his hat-trick here was the notification that Sir Alex Ferguson is blessed with a player who can make up for whatever inadequacies exist elsewhere in the team. </p> <p>Those deficiencies were evident in the second half when Ferguson's players allowed carelessness to infiltrate their performance, but by then Rooney had ensured their first victory in Group D. The England striker left the pitch to a standing ovation with the match ball as his souvenir for a remarkable night's work, a performance which incorporated vision, finesse and the embryonic signs of a partnership with Ruud van Nistelrooy that could inspire feelings of trepidation in the world's most accomplished defender. </p> <p>Rooney's mere inclusion was guaranteed to generate a crackle of excitement inside Old Trafford but there was still something extraordinary about the way in which he consigned the likes of Van Nistelrooy and Ryan Giggs, as well as they played, to a place in the supporting cast. </p> <p>Every time he took possession he shimmered with menace. He showed anticipation, courage, immaculate control and his goals were exquisite, from the two thumping shots that helped United to a 3-0 half-time lead to the wonderfully taken free-kick with which he completed his hat-trick eight minutes after the restart. </p> <p>For aesthetic quality, the best was probably the last, but there was individual excellence attached to all three. First when Van Nistelrooy's through-ball bisected the visiting defence and Rooney's instinctive left-foot shot soared into the net. Then when the \u00a327m signing from Everton picked up the ball and, unfazed by several defenders, drove a magnificent shot beyond Rustu Recber. Left foot, right foot - it does not seem to matter to Rooney. </p> <p>It began to feel like a trick of the mind that Ferguson's experimentation elsewhere in his side had provoked so much disquiet before the kick-off. </p> <p>The manager confounded everyone, not only by giving Roy Keane the night off but by demoting Cristiano Ronaldo and John O'Shea . The only logical conclusion to draw was that he regarded Fenerbahce as little more than a bunch of sightseers - an assertion which proved every bit as accurate as Rooney's finishing. </p> <p>In came Eric Djemba-Djemba, Kleberson and, most bewildering of all, David Bellion. Equally surprising was Gary Neville's return to action only three weeks after suffering a hairline fracture of his kneecap in England's World Cup qualifier in Poland. His recovery, a full month ahead of initial expectations, will be encouraging for Sven-Goran Eriksson but not for Wes Brown, who faces a prolonged spell on the sidelines. </p> <p>Still, Ferguson can hardly be accused of underestimating Fenerbahce. United were ahead after only seven minutes, when Giggs glanced in a header from Kleberson's cross, and their opponents could not extend Roy Carroll throughout the opening 45 minutes. </p> <p>Briefly the Turkish champions offered themselves a flicker of hope when Marcio Nobre made it 3-1 from a badly defended corner within a minute of the restart, but not even the most pessimistic United follower could have been fooled into thinking it would be the catalyst for the most unlikely of comebacks. </p> <p>Seven minutes later Frank de Bleeckere awarded a questionable free-kick against Fabio Luciano 20 yards from goal. This was usually Giggs territory but the winger was happy to stand aside for Rooney to curl his free-kick into the top right-hand corner. Even Eriksson, disregarding his usual decorum, jumped out of his seat at that. </p> <p>To Ferguson's irritation, more dubious defending presented Tuncay Sanli with the chance to make it 4-2 soon afterwards. Indeed, United were beginning to look jittery until Van Nistelrooy scored the fifth, collecting Darren Fletcher's pass and expertly finishing from 12 yards. </p> <p>Bellion added the sixth but there was no mistaking the fact this was Rooney's night. An unforgettable one at that.</p>",
  "<p>It would perhaps have been a little too neat if Joe Royle's 1,000th game as a manager had resulted in his Ipswich side going top of the championship, but they gave it one heck of a try. </p> <p>Having had a good grumble about a Reading equaliser he considered to be \"blatantly\" offside, Royle admitted he was delighted with a performance of a quality which suggested he has a team fully capable of adding to the promotions he has previously overseen with Oldham and Manchester City. </p> <p>He was pleased too he could celebrate the occasion with Steve Coppell, like Royle - and John Lennon - a former pupil of Quarry Bank School in Liverpool. Both men like to send out balanced teams who try to pass the ball and, despite spending much of the game under pressure, Reading too showed their position at the top of the table is no fluke. </p> <p>Barely 10 minutes had elapsed when Kevin Horlock's long ball deceived the Reading centre-half Ivar Ingimarsson, curling over his head. Shefki Kuqi, scorer of two late goals against Plymouth on Saturday, bravely got his head to the ball before the advancing goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann could intervene, and then from an awkward angle curled the ball into the empty net. </p> <p>Reading came back strongly, but the Ipswich central defenders Jason De Vos and Richard Naylor looked solid. It was unfortunate for the home team that De Vos had to leave the pitch to have a cut stitched, and the visitors took full advantage. The full-back Drissa Diallo moved across to cover but got caught on the wrong side of Dave Kitson, who ran on to Nicky Forster's neat through-ball and slipped his shot around Kelvin Davis. </p> <p>Kuqi, for whom no cause is ever lost, almost put Ipswich back into the lead 10 seconds into the second period, throwing himself at Darren Bent's low cross and just failing to turn it past the mesmerised Hahnemann. </p> <p>The pressure Ipswich were exerting should have paid off on the hour, when Diallo's pass bisected the Reading defence. All Kuqi had to do was control the ball, but his touch, never the most sensitive, was wooden in the extreme.</p>",
  "It looks as if the four Britons still held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay are to get some sort of trial, even if most of the rights and safeguards usually accorded to accused prisoners will be missing. But, however unfair and objectionable the process against them, they are being given a lot more than their counterparts held in a British jail - the 11 foreign nationals who have already spent three years in captivity with no prospect of a trial or any hint of a release date. <p>That may change. Next Monday their fate is finally to be decided by the House of Lords. No fewer than nine law lords will hear the men's lawyers argue that their detention is unlawful. But the nine will not include Lord Steyn, a law lord generally considered to be one of the very best judges of our time. He's been bumped off the case at the government's request. </p> <p>The appeal raises a fundamental issue about the legality of David Blunkett's anti-terror laws, in particular the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which allows for the indefinite detention of foreign nationals suspected of links with terrorism. </p> <p>In normal circumstances, such a law would be against the European convention on human rights, article 5 of which guarantees an individual's \"right to liberty\". However, a government is allowed to \"derogate\" from article 5 at times of \"war or other public emergency threatening the life of a nation\". This is what the British government did. </p> <p>Soon afterwards Lord Steyn, in the course of a lecture attended mainly by lawyers and judges, uttered the single sentence that was to get him into trouble. \"In my view, the suspension of article 5 ... is not, in the present circumstances, justified.\" </p> <p>That remark has now been used to suggest that Steyn has made up his mind on the issue and is therefore unfit to sit on the case next month. In 2002, the court of appeal ruled that there was \"ample material\" on which Blunkett could have decided that there was an emergency threatening the life of the nation. We don't know what this material amounted to - even the detainees and their lawyers couldn't be told - but the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, explained that the court was required to show \"deference\" to the home secretary, who was better qualified to decide questions of national security than the judges. </p> <p>The fact that the law applied only to foreign nationals was not unlawful discrimination, the court of appeal also decided. When it was announced that there would be an appeal to the House of Lords, government lawyers moved quickly to make sure Lord Steyn was not among the judges. The Treasury Solicitors' Department, acting for Blunkett, wrote to Lord Bingham, the senior law lord, pointing out what Steyn had said and asking that he not be included among the panel of nine. Bingham agreed, and Steyn apparently accepted that he should not sit. </p> <p>At the time, I wrote that he had no alternative but to stand down. I'm now convinced I was wrong, and that Bingham and Steyn were wrong to accede to the home secretary's demand. Steyn's absence could make the difference between the government's winning and losing, between freedom for illegally held detainees and their continued timeless incarceration. It's too simplistic to divide the law lords into liberals and conservatives; but looking at the law lords who will be sitting on the appeal, the decision could well be reached by a five to four majority. </p> <p>More important is the question of principle. All judges have opinions on many issues, some of which could become the subject of future cases. But the point about our top judges is that they can put aside their feelings and decide cases only according to the law presented in court. When Steyn made his remark, he had not had some of the country's leading barristers arguing the case before him over several days, as the law lords will have next month. If he had, he might well have changed his mind. </p> <p>The difference between Steyn and other judges is that he announced his opinion in public. His colleagues have views too, but tell only their spouses or close friends. They remain immune from being dumped, as Steyn has been. The contrary argument is that because Steyn made his view known publicly, he is publicly perceived to be already biased. We do not know what the silent ones believe so we can't claim pre-judgment on their part. And yet their private prejudices could be far more extreme than the openly expressed views of Steyn. Is it not better that we should know? </p> <p>It comes down to trusting our judges to be scrupulously fair, honest and unbiased in reaching their decisions. What has happened to Steyn shows that that trust is missing. That's a terrible indictment of the judiciary. It's also totally misguided. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b><a href=\"mailto:mberlins@aol.com\">Marcel Berlins</a> is the Guardian's legal columnist.</p>",
  "So, the government claims it would cost \u00a322bn to renationalise the railways (Darling spurns railways buyback, September 28)? Maybe, but only if you insisted on buying the shares of the operating companies. Why doesn't the government simply wait for the operating contracts to come up for renewal, and then not renew them? That way they would lapse by default back to government control, without the need for any public expenditure. The government could then assign the operating contract to a new, publicly owned national operating body (for no fee, of course). The system would gradually be reclaimed at no cost to the taxpayer - and with the instant savings produced by not having to pay subsidies that are simply frittered away in dividend payments to shareholders, and consequently lost to the rail system. <br> <b>Jonathan Dore</b> <br> Pender Island, British Columbia, Canada <p>When I worked for Railtrack, I was told that British Rail had been broken up in such a way that it could never be fully renationalised. One of the main obstacles isn't the passenger train companies, it's the freight sector, dominated by the mighty English Welsh and Scottish company (EWS), in turn owned by the even more mighty American company Wisconsin Central. When the freight sector was hived off, most of the freight yards were handed over to EWS at virtually no cost. If these were bought back, EWS would no doubt demand compensation at full market rates. Interestingly, all newly opened freight yards, such as Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire, are under Network Rail control, though operated by other companies. Then there are the Roscos, the companies that own the trains operated by the train-operating companies. How much to buy all the trains back as well? <br><b>Paul Morrison</b><br> Peterborough, Cambs </p> <p>When the 1945 Labour government nationalised the utilities, they issued government-backed stock (gas stock, water stock etc) which could be traded on the market, in lieu of the shares - rather than pay out large sums of cash.

  "A known activist with a prison sentence for protesting against Tony Blair's policies disrupted the most crucial conference speech of the prime minister's leadership yesterday - despite a massive security operation. <p>Hector Christie, 42, an Old Etonian anti-war protester, was allowed into the conference hall, where he was able to stand up and accuse Mr Blair of having blood on his hands. </p> <p>About 20 minutes later, pro-hunting demonstrators also heckled Mr Blair and were bundled out - leading to a total of three arrests. </p> <p>Thousands of police massed outside the conference centre to control a coalition of Countryside Alliance and anti-war protesters. </p> <p>But, in a move that will raise questions about the \u00a34m security operation, the disruption came from demonstrators who had recently become Labour party members - with one of the pro-hunters gaining his membership in the past two days. </p> <p>Last night, the Labour party put out a statement saying it had issued the prized passes for the prime minister's' speech after Sussex police conducted \"enhanced background checks\". </p> <p>\"It is right that anyone who wants to come to conference can do so subject to the police conducting their background checks whether they are a party member or not,\" the statement said. \"The police advised us they would conduct enhanced background checks on people who have not attended conference before.\" </p> <p>But Sussex police denied a security breach had occurred and refused to discuss the nature of the checks. </p> <p>A spokesman said the three arrested protesters had been given visitors passes by the party and that stewarding inside the conference centre was a matter for Labour not the police. \"This is more a breach of trust between these individuals and the Labour party.\" </p> <p>While a Labour source said there was no reason someone with a spent conviction should not be able to attend conference, Mr Christie, who owns the Tapeley Park estate in north Devon and whose family home is Glyndebourne, admitted that he had been shocked to gain party membership and a pass. He received a seven-day prison sentence in 2002 for failing to pay a \u00a3120 fine imposed for demonstrating against the foot-and-mouth culling. </p> <p>As he was led away, Mr Christie said: \"I'm protesting because of the illegal war in Iraq. Tens of thousands of people are being killed unnecessarily. Tens of thousands. </p> <p>\"I am not a serviceman, I know soldiers, friends out there who hate Tony Blair. He should be impeached for this war in Iraq.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair shrugged off the outburst - but around 20 minutes later there was a second commotion as about six hunting supporters stood up, began shouting and set off rape alarms on the balcony overlooking the main floor.</p>",
  "The British media spotlight on Iraq has understandably swung to kidnapping and murder of hostages in recent days, and now to the killing of British soldiers in Basra, and away from the disgrace of Abu Ghraib or the interesting affair of our ambassador in Rome, Sir Ivor Roberts, who apparently was undiplomatic enough to say that President George Bush is the best recruiting sergeant for al-Qaida. <p>Abu Ghraib, and allegations of ill-treatment of prisoners or worse by British personnel, have more resonance in America and Britain, where they touch painfully and directly on our national honour, than in Iraq and the region. For those directly involved, they are overshadowed by the horrors of the past under Saddam Hussein and by the death of thousands killed by the invaders. </p> <p>As for Sir Ivor, an ambassador's job is to defend the interests of his country and the policy of his government. Our ambassadors are, for the most part, wise and honourable men and women. When it becomes clear that the government's policy is not serving the country's interests, they are in an impossible position. An ambassador cannot always duck a question, and he couldn't have said that US policy in Iraq is right. It isn't. </p> <p>Important and newsworthy though all these topics are, we should not let them distract us from the bigger picture, which Colin Powell has rightly described as \"getting worse\". The political settlement that brought fragile peace to Falluja has collapsed, and the Americans are again using heavy weapons, including air-to-ground missiles, inside the town, building up yet more hatred and problems for the future. Elsewhere, the daily killing of Iraqis and Americans goes on. </p> <p> My Iraqi friends, assessing the difficulties they now face, usually put economic and employment problems number one, even before security. According to a new report by MEC International, results from donor pledges are poor. Last October, $33bn was pledged in Madrid, but of the US contribution of $18bn, for example, only $500m had been disbursed by July. </p> <p>More reliance is being placed on future oil receipts. The 2004 budget foresees revenues from oil in 2005 and 2006 which would allow investment in reconstruction of various sectors at $5.3bn per year. High oil prices have raised expectations, but sabotage and looting of oil installations continue. The current oil output is not generating revenue at anything like that level. An increase in production capacity depends on investment by the international oil industry. However, a conference planned by the oil ministry for April has been indefinitely postponed because of security problems, and companies are unlikely to invest until the problems are overcome and a government of undisputed legitimacy is in place, presumably after elections at the beginning of next year. The cost implications of these problems for the coalition are obvious. </p> <p>When your fingers are caught in the mangle you can't just walk away. If we left Iraq tomorrow, we would be rightly blamed for the chaos which would follow. The first thing to do is stop turning the handle, and then turn it back inch by inch. Our Iraq policy should be step-by-step disengagement, and we should start now. When the occupying powers draw back, as they did in Najaf, there is a chance for Iraqis to find political solutions to their problems; when the occupying powers remain centre stage, the result is that more blood is shed - British, American and Iraqi blood. </p> <p>John Kerry's attacks on Bush \"refusing to come clean with the American people\" are a move in the right direction, even if the president is able to make a debating point on what Kerry said about the war in the past. We should welcome the change. We should also listen to Kofi Annan's speech to the UN general assembly, in which he said again what we all knew: the war on Iraq is illegal, and illegal acts by great powers gravely undermine the rule of law. </p> <p>These new developments from time to time create a fleeting opportunity for our own government to start to recover its position. Let's hope the Labour party conference will have the guts to say it to the prime minister. </p> <p>The issue is not so much, as Tony Blair put it to delegates yesterday, whether he should apologise for having been involved in the effort to remove Saddam. Nor is it even, as a protester claimed, that he has \"blood on his hands\". Stop worrying about the past, stop worrying about the use of intelligence and whether Blair acted in good faith, and grasp the reality. The policy has got to change. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:mail@olivermiles.com\">Oliver Miles</a> is a former ambassador to Libya; in April he organised the letter signed by 52 former British ambassadors criticising George Bush and Tony Blair's Middle East policy.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> Are all the half-decent former diplomats trapped under something heavy? We only ask as Sir David Gore-Booth, the chap drafted on to the Today programme yesterday to defend Jack Straw's unfortunate handshake with Robert Mugabe at the UN played an absolute blinder, explaining of the confusion: \"There's a lot of people [at the UN], and quite a lot of them are black. It's quite difficult to sort them out.\" Yeeees... Oddly, the interview was terminated shortly after that, but the Diary's Simon Goodley calls to congratulate David, and to check he concurs with other popular views of black people, such as their tactical naivety in football, and their timeworn failure to fancy it on a wet Wednesday in January away to Charlton. Slightly unusually, he's only able to get hold of his mother (David is 61), who informs him that the former ambassador to Saudi Arabia is \"probably sleeping as he's not feeling well\". Yes, we heard the interview. Anyway, we're rather nervous of pressing the point in a household clearly modelled on Sorry!, the somewhat disturbing 80s Ronnie Corbett sitcom, so we say goodbye before Mother Gore-Davis can shout \"Language, Timothy!\" at us. <p><b>\u00b7</b> Meanwhile, the hunting debate remains the most elevating exchange of views in British politics, with yesterday in Brighton its glorious fulcrum. On the one hand, pro-hunt campaigners made some still obscure intellectual point by dumping four animal carcasses in Brighton city centre. And on the other, conference organisers banned the League Against Cruel Sports from selling their fox glove puppets, apparently out of concern that delegates might have waved them too excitedly during Blair's speech. Such class!</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> By the way, if anyone's wondering where the real debate's taking place, it appears to be on Five's reality TV show, The Farm. The programme's first night yielded a heated discussion between the various celebrity contestants about racism. The second featured a debate over the Iraq hostage crisis, which resulted in diminutive magician Paul Daniels squaring up to the profoundly imbecilic former US rapper, Vanilla Ice. Paul Daniels has now left the show. Anyway, if you're inspired by the fact these arguments are being rehearsed on reality TV - by the former Every Second Counts presenter and a man once spotted reading Smash Hits with his finger - while Brighton rocks to the sound of glove puppets fighting it out with animal corpses, why not give the Diary a call? We want to hear from you.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Now this really is today's last word on the subject of puppets, but we have an update on Let My Puppets Come, the marionette-staffed hardcore movie which is thus far the standout entry in the Diary's search for the best adult movie title of all time. Our promised review of this work is postponed, as the tape we were due to watch at the weekend vanished. A new one has been ordered, but in the meantime, did we mention it's also a musical? Honestly.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> A delight to find Elliot Morley in fine form at a meeting at Brighton's Albion Hotel yesterday, promoting crops which can be put to innovative uses. \"Take hemp,\" enthused the environment minister. \"Car dashboards are now being made from it. And it has the additional benefit that when you scrap the car... you can smoke it.\" Well. The whole reason we shunned conference this year was because we heard organisers still frowned on mind-bending drugs (we couldn't honestly be expected to face the event without them) so Elliot's blessing comes as a welcome surprise.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Finally, there will be no comment on the PM's speech, as we found ourselves straying into dangerously tasteless territory the moment the collapsed Northern Ireland secretary, Paul Murphy, told paramedics that he'd started to feel \"queasy\" during it.</p>",
  "In the long and undistinguished history of the ill-judged handshake, Jack Straw's clasping palms with Robert Mugabe probably ranks below Neville Chamberlain's greeting of Adolf Hitler, especially since the latter followed it with a \"Sieg heil\". <p>But the foreign secretary's political faux pas, at a party at the UN last week, came back to haunt him yesterday. </p> <p>The Conservatives called the handshake a \"scandalous betrayal\", but of equal embarrassment was Mr Straw's excuse that he had not recognised the president of Zimbabwe because of the dark. </p> <p>As with so many things in life, it is not the act itself that is most damaging but being caught at it - especially by a television crew. </p> <p>The footage, shown on BBC2's Newsnight on Monday, shows Mr Mugabe sitting regally in a chair. Mr Straw, introduced by an aide to the man Britain has denounced for rigging elections, persecuting opponents and causing the economic collapse of Zimbabwe, pauses for a moment before stopping to offer his hand for what appears to be a weak shake. \"Nice to see you, nice to see you,\" he says.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe replies, \"Nice to see you,\" before asking an adviser, \"Who was that?\" When told the president, fresh from delivering a scathing attack on Britain during the UN general assembly, is seen creasing up with laughter. </p> <p>\"I hadn't expected to see President Mugabe there,\" Mr Straw said later. \"It was quite dark in that corner I was being pushed towards... then it transpired it was [him]. But the fact that there is a serious disagreement between Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom does not mean you should then be discourteous or rude.\" </p> <p>Sensibly the foreign secretary refused to blame his lack of glasses, recently replaced by contact lenses, for the mistake.</p> <p>Peter Bull, a body language expert from York University, said Mr Straw had made the best of a bad job.</p> <p>\"It looks as though he was ambushed, but once in that situation he stretches out his arm and keeps his body as far away from Mr Mugabe as possible. It looks as though Mugabe is clinging on to his hand and as soon as the handshake is released Mr Straw makes his getaway.\"</p> <p>But Michael Ancram, the Tories' foreign affairs spokesman, said: \"This is a scandalous betrayal of the men and women of Zimbabwe suffering at the hands of Mugabe's bloodstained regime. Jack Straw... has sent a powerful message of support to Mugabe, which will have shocked all those who seek the restoration of democracy and the rule of law to Zimbabwe.\"</p> <p><b>Shakers and movers</b></p> <p><b> Those who shook...</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Neville Chamberlain brushed palms with both Hitler and Mussolini in 1938, a year before the second world war broke out </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Donald Rumsfeld, the US defence secretary, shook hands with Saddam Hussein without any hesitancy while brokering a deal to construct an oil pipeline in Iraq in 1983 </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In 1995 Mary Robinson, the Irish president - later the UN's champion of human rights - shook hands with General Augusto Pinochet, under whose dictatorship in Chile thousands died </p> <p><b> And those who didn't...</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Prince Charles turned down the hand of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin at Jomo Kenyatta's funeral in 1978 </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In 1984, when he was Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl refused to take the hand of PW Botha, the apartheid leader and the president of South Africa at the time </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Fidel Castro held a cigar in his right hand as an excuse not to shake hands because of rumours suggesting the CIA planned to assassinate him with a poisoned powder absorbed through the palm</p>"
