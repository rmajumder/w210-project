  "<p>Andy Farrell will have his brother-in-law alongside him when he leads Great Britain for the 25th time at the City of Manchester Stadium tomorrow, after the Lions coach Brian Noble revealed yesterday that Sean O'Loughlin will make his Test debut in the Gillette Tri-Nations game against Australia. </p> <p>\"I used to babysit for him when he was five,\" joked Farrell, who is married to O'Loughlin's older sister Colleen. \"He was a good quiet lad, but he's emerged as a real leader for us at Wigan this season. All the family will be there to watch us both.\" </p> <p>Noble also confirmed that Danny McGuire, another 21-year-old who scored 39 tries for Leeds this season, will win his first cap, although he will not name his team until an hour before the kick-off. </p> <p>The 19-man squad includes four more uncapped players: Wigan's Stephen Wild, Bradford's Stuart Reardon, and Chev Walker and Ryan Bailey of Leeds. Bailey seems certain to be involved because Stuart Fielden is the only other specialist prop, although Farrell and Adrian Morley could play in the front row. Reardon and Walker may contest the left-wing position, assuming Brian Carney, Martin Gleeson and Keith Senior are the other three-quarters. </p> <p>Matt Diskin and Micky Higham are not in the 19 so Terry Newton will start at hooker, despite infuriating the Australians with his indiscipline in 2003's Ashes series. Paul Johnson, who is ill, Iestyn Harris and Danny Ward also miss out. </p> <p>Australia's coach Wayne Bennett will name his team today, with Ben Kennedy and Shaun Timmins both hoping to recover from illness. The Kangaroos have failed to block the appointment of New Zealand's Glen Black as referee. </p> <p> <strong> Great Britain</strong> (from): Radlinski, Wellens, Reardon, Carney, Wild, Gleeson, Senior, Walker, McGuire, Long, Newton, Fielden, Farrell (capt), Morley, Bailey, Peacock, Ellis, Sculthorpe, O'Loughlin.</p>",
  "<p>David Shepherd may be 63, but yesterday he showed all the agility of a boxing referee. The English umpire used his ample frame to step smartly between India's acting captain Rahul Dravid and the Australian batsman Justin Langer as they waved angry fingers at each other here on the third day of the third Test. </p> <p>It was the closest the game came to an interesting contest in the torpor of a warm afternoon as Australia consolidated their considerable advantage. </p> <p>The incident was out of keeping in a series that has been played in an excellent spirit and it is unlikely any action will be taken against the players, although Langer was later reprimanded by his own team management for slow scoring. </p> <p>It had begun when Langer exchanged words with Mohammad Kaif when the batsman took exception to the fielder's appeal from cover for lbw. Dravid walked down the pitch from his usual position at first slip apparently intent on defusing the situation but instead appeared to hurl a can of petrol on the flames. </p> <p>India do not need any help when it comes to picking a fight, for they have enough skirmishes going on inside their own camp. </p> <p>Yesterday the former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Rajsingh Dungarpur, attacked India's captain Sourav Ganguly, who is not playing in the match, for his criticism of the pitch. </p> <p>Dungarpur also criticised the decision to keep faith with the wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel, whose work behind the stumps has been abysmal in this series. \"It's a very sad state of affairs that he has not been replaced,\" he said. </p> <p>The former selector Kirti Azad has said that politics within the selection committee are the reason for Patel's prolonged presence in the side. He said that he and Syed Kirmani, the former chairman of selectors, had proposed the names of other keepers but were constantly outvoted. Azad added that Kiran More, the West Zone selector, told Kirmani that he did not have the credentials to judge Patel who, according to local cricket writers, has fluffed 23 chances in 19 Tests (not counting half-chances) which have cost 675 runs. Kirmani and More are both former Test wicketkeepers. </p> <p>It was also rumoured yesterday morning that Ganguly, whose job is under pressure and not only because he's a Patel supporter, would not play in the final Test as he felt the series was slipping away and he wanted to distance himself from the calamity. </p> <p>Ganguly's non-appearance next week was made more likely by a statement on the player's health. \"Medical investigations have revealed intra-articular pathology of the right hip joint noted by increased synovial fluid accumulation.\" Precisely. </p> <p>As for the cricket, Australia lead by 415 with eight second-innings wickets and two days left, but the prospect of an overnight declaration never entered Adam Gilchrist's head at the end of play last night. </p> <p>Australia closed on 202 for three, after winning a first-innings advantage of 213, but Gilchrist may decide to bat on into this afternoon, when the lead should be somewhere between 500 and 600. </p> <p>Australia have had the willing help of the local groundsman, who produced a grassy pitch that suits tall fast bowlers, of which Australia have three and India none. </p> <p>India resumed on 146 for five and lasted 70 minutes before they were bowled out for 185, with Jason Gillespie taking five for 56. Australia piled on the runs in the afternoon with Simon Katich, who looked stone cold lbw before he had scored, making 99.</p>",
  "<p>I see that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Kevin Keegan could be in trouble for comments they've made about referees. It's quite common for managers to have to explain to the Football Association why they've said things about officials and I think it's time to change the way this business is dealt with. </p> <p>I understand why the FA doesn't want managers ranting and raving about referees. You don't want people using yobbish language, saying a referee is a cheat, clown or disgrace. But there should be greater freedom of speech. </p> <p>There are a lot of good referees but some have off days, like any player or manager, and I don't see why I shouldn't be able to say: \"The referee had a bad game, the worst I've been involved in this year. He did this and that.\" As things stand I think I could be fined and it's not right. </p> <p>I've gone in after defeats as a manager and told the press: \"We played badly. I picked the wrong players, the wrong tactics, made the wrong substitutions. We weren't at our best.\" So why shouldn't I speak the truth about a referee as well? </p> <p>It seems to me that part of the problem is that it's not just what you say but where you say it. I think I could say certain words about a referee at Kidderminster. But I can't say them in the Premiership because it would generate a huge newspaper headline and the FA doesn't want that. </p> <p>I don't actually think the FA should look after these things at all. I'd like to see guidelines sorted out by the League Managers Association, in consultation with the Professional Footballers' Association, which make it clear what you can and can't say about referees. </p> <p>Then it should be down to the LMA to warn or fine us if we step out of line. I would be more concerned if my union said: \"Get a grip, you're not doing yourself, your profession or the game any favours.\" I'd think they were right. </p> <p>I got punished for calling a referee a clown and that was fair. It was my first year in management and I wrote to the referee that day. I said I'm sorry for upsetting your family but that's the way I am now. My team's second from bottom and I feel the whole world's against me. He accepted my apology. </p> <p>I'm supposed to be a ranter and raver but that's actually the only time I've been done for comments about a referee. People think I was at it the whole time but I wasn't. Last season at Southampton I gave only two bad reports about referees and I'm sure I got beaten more than twice, so it shows I can accept a defeat. </p> <p>Sometimes if I had said what I thought about referees I could really have been in trouble - I might have been sued - but there are still ways you can put your point across. </p> <p>I sometimes disguised it by saying something like: \"The referee gave me a memorable performance I will never forget. If I'm sitting at a golf club in Edinburgh in 20 years and someone says to me: 'I've just seen the worst performance of refereeing in my life', I'll remember this one.\" </p> <p>There's a perception that managers blame referees to deflect from their team's performance but we're not that politically minded. We don't think: \"Let's get into the referee and everybody will forget what they've seen.\" I don't think you can con your public. You make a bigger fool of yourself trying to blame the referee for something that's not there. </p> <p>It is true that managers are happier to criticise a referee than their players, but I don't need a bond with the referee. I want him to be impartial and do the best he can, and I think referees do that. But I need my players to be my friends, team-mates, people I can rely on. </p> <p>When I first became a manager I sometimes felt down on myself after games because I couldn't control my emotions. I looked around and thought: \"He seems to be more controlled than me.\" But the more I looked I realised we are all the same. </p> <p>Someone like Wenger looks cool, calm and collected but he'll still react. It's just that he usually wins or draws. He and Keegan reacted the same way after defeats last weekend, only they put it over in different manners. Managers like Keegan, Gary Megson and Sam Allardyce are talked about as ranters and ravers but they're the ones who have been fighting at the bottom. </p> <p>After a game any manager would love to go right home, put our feet up and have a cup of tea or a drink, but we have to talk to the media. We are forced to meet people who poke and prod until you show emotion, whether it's exuberance, anger, disappointment. You try to be honest but when you're honest about referees you can risk a fine of thousands of pounds.</p>",
  "A prominent left-wing German politician faces charges of mass murder for his alleged role in one of Italy's most gruesome wartime atrocities. <p>Military prosecutors in La Spezia have sent a formal caution to 89-year-old Klaus Konrad, a former Social Democrat MP and legal adviser to Willy Brandt, a former German chancellor. </p> <p>The caution, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian, warns Mr Konrad that he is formally under investigation on suspicion of causing the deaths of 61 people \"needlessly and without a justified motive\". </p> <p>The prosecutors accuse him of taking part in a string of massacres in 1944 near the Tuscan city of Arezzo. They say some of the victims were buried alive and others were blown apart with explosives. Many were tortured before they were killed. The dead included children and women, one of whom was pregnant. </p> <p>In an interview to be televised last night by the ARD, the German public broadcast system, Mr Konrad admitted only to having been present when the civilians were tortured. He expressed regret for the killings but said he had done so \"only since the Italians have got me by the scruff of the neck\". </p> <p>ARD said its researchers had found British files containing accounts by witnesses who said Mr Konrad had personally supervised the executions that followed the torture. </p> <p>The massacres were among many carried out by the German army as troops retreated along the Italian peninsula in an effort to crush or punish partisan resistance. Details of the killings remained hidden for half a century because the Italian authorities were keen not to damage relations with federal Germany during the cold war. </p> <p>In 1944, Mr Konrad was a second lieutenant in a grenadiers unit, the 274th regiment, but, according to the Italian daily paper Corriere della Sera, he was no ordinary soldier. The paper says that, by the age of 19, he had become a member of the Nazi party's brown-shirted storm troops, the SA. </p> <p>After the war, Mr Konrad joined West Germany's centre-left Social Democrat party. He rose to become, first, a regional MP for the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, and then a member of the federal parliament. </p> <p>The notification sent to his seaside home says he is under formal investigation on two counts of mass murder and one of unnecessarily torching civilian homes. The first set of 13 killings occurred in and near the village of San Polo. The remaining 48 people all died in San Polo. </p> <p>In the interview due to be screened last night, Mr Konrad said the commander of his battalion, Wolf Ewert, ordered him to interrogate 50 or so suspected partisans left in a cellar. The Italian military prosecutors said these people were beaten with \"staves, rubber hoses and rifle butts\" before being taken to another house nearby for execution. Mr Konrad admitted the Italians were tortured and told his commander that the prisoners were partisans. But he said it was Ewert who gave the execution order. Agreeing with the decision, he and two other German officers sat down to discuss the \"modalities\" of how the captives should be killed. </p> <p>ARD quoted witnesses saying that six men belonging to a partisan group were shot first. Sixteen prisoners in a second group were dumped in a grave at right angles to each other and buried in sand. Some are thought to have suffocated. </p> <p>In last night's interview Mr Konrad admitted the people were also blown up with explosives to prevent the allies, then closing in rapidly on the German frontline, from discovering what had taken place. In Italy, he was reported as telling his interviewers: \"Someone had the idea of blowing them up with dynamite to hide the traces of torture.\" </p> <p>In 1967, German prosecutors in Giessen began an investigation into the San Polo massacre, charging Mr Konrad, and his wartime commander and five other officers, with murder. </p> <p>In 1972, however, a court found there was no proof of murder, only of manslaughter. Under German law the charge of manslaughter had expired and the case against Mr Konrad was dropped. </p> <p>After retiring as a backbench MP, he continued his political career at local level. He now lives in Scharbeutz, north-east of Hamburg. Ewert died 10 years ago.</p>",
  "My father is 76 and suffers from terrible pain in his knee and ankle. His walking is now so bad that he hardly goes anywhere. Witnessing the agony he is in when he climbs the stairs at home is distressing. He refuses to see a doctor, alternately claiming that there is nothing that can be done and citing some scare story about orthopaedic procedures from the internet. He drives my mother mad just sitting there or expecting her to drive him around. He will fly into a rage if anyone suggests he seeks medical help. We have found out about the latest orthopaedic surgical techniques, dietary advice and exercises, but he isn't interested. He is bored and depressed and I feel he would be much happier if he had some outside stimulation, but he is clearly limited by his mobility problems. How can I help him to help himself? <p><b>Accept his wishes</b><br> My mother was in a similar situation and did seek help, and eventually went on to have successful orthopaedic surgery. She taught me a lot about respecting her wishes and allowing her to make her own decisions in her own time; she lived her life the way she wanted to live it. In her 70s, she often resented being given any advice, however well-meaning, especially about changing her diet or lifestyle. While I also found it unbearably distressing to see her in constant pain, I was so emotionally involved that I made many mistakes while truly believing I was trying to help her. </p> <p>Take your mother out for a really enjoyable day and find the right time to ask her how you can best support her - helping her to live the life she wants to live while dealing with the most challenging aspects of your father's behaviour would be enormously supportive. </p> <p>Look after yourself and try to ensure that when you do spend time with your father, you do so when you're not too tired or emotionally vulnerable. Accept that he has the right to refuse to see a doctor or seek treatment. </p> <p>Once you give up on trying to influence your father, you may well find that many more positive and enjoyable times unfold. There will be fewer outbursts of anger, and believe it or not, you may even find more ways to laugh together. <br><b>NJ, Leicester</b> </p> <p><b>He can avoid surgery</b><br> Your father sounds as if he is stuck in unhappiness and pain, but he has by no means exhausted the possibilities for improving his situation. Pain clinics in most major hospitals offer careful assessment, explanation and a range of treatments short of surgery. If the pain itself cannot be abolished, as is often the case, they may offer pain-management techniques. </p> <p>Such treatment would help him become more mobile and enable him to do more of the things that he enjoys and finds satisfying. It could also help to tackle his despairing outlook and his feeling that he is alone with his pain. This can be done by using practical and psychological strategies, based on concern for the struggle with pain, without denying it or suggesting that it is psychological in origin. </p> <p>Focusing on the problems caused by pain, rather than on the pain itself, could improve the whole family's outlook on the situation. <br><b>Name and address withheld</b> </p> <p><b>Contact social services</b><br> First, he needs to get a stairlift if possible - social services should be able to advise you about making adaptations to your parents' home. Perhaps they should also consider moving him to a bungalow. </p> <p>Do you have a family friend who could point out to him that by refusing treatment he is also making his wife and family suffer as well as himself? </p> <p>Try contacting arthritis charities too - they can be very helpful. <br><b>WH, West Yorkshire</b> </p> <p><b>Surgery was my saviour</b><br> I am 74 and have three daughters, one son and 13 grandchildren. I am sure that my pain and incapacity has distressed them over the years, but I was largely left to make my own decisions about any treatment I had. </p> <p>Two years ago, I decided to have both knees replaced surgically - new hinges were inserted to replace my own joints, and I gained just over an inch in height. A year ago, I had both hip joints replaced. I was in pain for about six months after each operation. </p> <p>Now I can walk a mile or more, climb stairs, play some golf and drive long distances. Without the surgery, I had no hope at all, and decided to go for it or die in the attempt - I have also now had a heart-valve replacement and pacemaker. </p> <p>Let your father read this - I doubt that I would have the life and hope that I do now. </p> <p>Don't agonise over the situation if you can help it - ultimately the decision is his. Pain and dire necessity drive you to do something in the end, although the earlier that action is taken, the less pain you have to suffer beforehand. </p> <p>If you are looking for treatment on the NHS, there will be a wait, and only one joint can be done at a time, as it is difficult for him to be cared for with both out of action. <br><b>MF, North Yorkshire</b> </p> <p><b>Ask your GP to pop in</b><br> My wife's father was your father's age when it became apparent that his health was failing. He had always suffered from a terror of hospitals and doctors, to the extent that he didn't even visit his own daughter when she was in hospital seriously ill. </p> <p>When he was unwell, we contacted his doctor's surgery and arranged for him to visit in quite a routine way; on the basis that it made sense for him to check on the health of his elderly patients. Perhaps you could contact your local GP and try to set up a similar home visit. <br><b>IF, Edinburgh</b> </p> <p><b>Listen to him</b><br> You are obviously a very loving daughter and a credit to your family. You seem to have done all that is possible to get the best information available and to help your father. I can see your frustration at his apparent lack of interest in improving his situation. It sounds as if he is so fearful of the future that he is trying his best not to face up to the deterioration in his health. </p> <p>Make sure he has access to the literature you have collected so that he can find out more when he feels courageous enough to look at his options. </p> <p>Let him know that you are there for him when he needs you. Ask him to help you see things from his point of view and to explain why he is not pursuing treatment. Explain why you want to help him, what your fears and worries are and why his current position in refusing medical help is hurting you. Accept responsibility for your own feelings and listen to what he has to say. </p> <p>If you find it difficult to address these issues in conversation, write him a letter. <br><b>LE, via email</b></p> <p><b>Next week</b><br>We live in a Victorian terraced street and our gardens are closely overlooked by our neighbours.

  "Yasser Arafat has been around on the Middle Eastern scene for so long that it is hard to imagine what the region would look like without him. But as the ageing Palestinian president slips into what may be serious illness, Arabs, Israelis and the world need to think about his legacy - and beyond. Mr Arafat's historic achievement, recognised by friend and even foe, was to hold together a disparate coalition of armed groups under the umbrella of the PLO to forge a sense of legitimacy. That challenged Arab regimes and an Israeli state which long refused to recognise the national existence, let alone the rights, of its existential enemy. His crowning moment came in 1974 when he mounted the podium at the United Nations general assembly to make his famous gun and olive branch speech. When the 1967 war and occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip brought the bulk of his people under Israeli rule, Mr Arafat began the path that led, through exile in Jordan, Lebanon, and Tunisia, back to Gaza and Ramallah, his headquarters-cum-prison, and his transformation from guerrilla leader into visionary statesman and recipient, with Yitzhak Rabin, of the Nobel peace prize. <p>But Mr Arafat will not be remembered as the architect of peace. The breakthrough at Oslo in 1993 and the later talks at Camp David ended in a dangerous impasse that exploded into the second intifada, an expression of Palestinian rage and frustration, the pace set by the suicide bombers who have done so much to create the bleak and bloody landscape of today's Holy Land. Opinions are divided on Mr Arafat's role in this fateful development. If he chose, as many believe he did, to ride a tiger he could not control, it was a highly risky strategy whose outcome is still being measured in daily death and misery. </p> <p>Nor, however iconic his global status as \"Mr Palestine\", will he be remembered as a leader who delivered what his people required. Palestinians themselves, not just the US, Israel and Europe, demanded a Palestinian Authority that was effective, uncorrupt and accountable. But Israel is also to blame for the failure of the PA, because of its provocative expansion of illegal settlements, endless border closures, daily humiliations, reprisals and the construction of the West Bank \"security fence\" in a manner that seemed to be as much a land grab as an act of legitimate defence. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's obituary has been written countless times before - and, so far, it has always had to be updated. But the timing of this latest illness may create new opportunities. Neither George Bush nor Ariel Sharon will deal with a man they have demonised and sidelined, but without him they will no longer be able to argue that they have no one to negotiate with. Tony Blair has already signalled that progress in the Middle East will follow next week's US election. Whoever is in the White House must renew pressure for implementation of the internationally agreed road map to peace, and not acquiesce in Mr Sharon's unilateral withdrawal from Gaza. A fresher, less flawed face in Ramallah would help a lot. </p> <p>It is part of Mr Arafat's inimitable style that he has always concentrated power in his own hands, declined to groom a successor and has stood by as factions vied for supremacy. No succession will be smooth or easy, whether the winner is an uncharismatic veteran like Mahmoud Abbas, or a younger, tough local leader like Mohammed Dahlan, a product of years of occupation and resistance. Any successor will have to deal with the challenge to the PA by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the Islamist groups whose power and appeal has increased as that of the PA has waned. These are just some of the new uncertainties that will come to the fore in a Middle East without Yasser Arafat. But this is the world into which the region may now be entering.</p>",
  "Wealthy Johannesburg suburbs won the right to seal themselves off against crime yesterday, despite claims that this marks a return to the no-go areas of the apartheid era. <p>The city council approved requests from dozens of communities to close their roads with barriers staffed by private guards to monitor and control access. </p> <p>Advocates described this as a necessary and effective measure to counter the murders, burglaries and car hijackings which plague South Africa's commercial capital. </p> <p>But critics said the gates, fences and booms were a throwback to the racist controls on the movement of black people. </p> <p>The council steered a middle-course by rejecting almost as many requests as it approved and suspending judgment on dozens of other. </p> <p>In the past decade residents of suburbs such as Sandton, Midrand and Kensington have blocked off 2,548 streets and hired uniformed guards to question pedestrians and motorists trying to enter. </p> <p>Evidence that the booms reduce crime boosted their popularity, but as more areas of the city became gated critics compared them to feudal castle keeps. </p> <p>After the debate had involved the Human Rights Commission and seemed likely to involve the constitutional court, the city council intervened and said residents needed to seek permission to keep barriers. </p> <p>The roads agency received 324 applications, some in-volving dozens of barriers, for 309 existing schemes and 15 new ones. </p> <p>The executive mayor, Amos Masondo, said 46 of the applications, covering 1,266 households, had been approved and 38 rejected. </p> <p>The rest had been referred to the police to see whether crime really had fallen as a result of the closures. </p> <p>\"We seek to ensure effective regulations and management of road closures and to ensure that people have access to all public facilities and to the relevant infrastructure,\" he said. </p> <p>Communities were being told yesterday whether their applications had succeeded. Those rejected had 10 days to appeal, after which the barriers would be removed. </p> <p>A roads agency spokesman, Mavela Dlamini, said suburbs allowed to keep booms were subject to stringent conditions to protect freedom of movement. Guards could not search pedestrians or vehicles or oblige people to register or supply personal information, he said. </p> <p>Open City Forum, which opposes the closures, is expected to continue campaigning. </p> <p>Advocates of the barriers deny that there are echoes of apartheid, pointing out that many residents of gated communities are black and share the security concerns of white neighbours. The mayor is reported to be one of them.</p>",
  "In 1956, South Africa's white minority apartheid government arrested 156 leaders and activists in the Congress Alliance. They were charged with high treason. <p>There was an immediate response from white progressives such as Bishop Ambrose Reeves, Ellen Hellman, Alex Hepple and Julius First - the South African Treason Trial Defence Fund was set up. Freda Levson, who has died aged 92, was appointed its administrative secretary, and for four years the fund provided welfare and legal aid for those on trial and their families. </p> <p>What then followed became one of the major forces that defeated apartheid. Via Canon John Collins, the International Defence and Aid fund was established, and through it millions of pounds were filtered to assist activists, and the thousands of victims of political persecutions, forced removals and banishments. </p> <p>Through that work with the fund, Freda forged close friendships with the leadership of what was then the Congress Alliance. Later, in London, she was to serve on the Council of the British Defence and Aid fund from 1980 to 1985. </p> <p>Born in Pretoria, South Africa, a doctor's daughter, she was educated in England from the age of 13, and read geography at St Hugh's College, Oxford. She spent her holidays in Scotland throughout her school years, and developed a deep love of and interest in her Scottish roots. </p> <p>At the outbreak of war she volunteered as an escort on a ship taking evacuee children to South Africa. There she remained with her family. </p> <p>In the early 1950s, she married the Russian emigr\u00e9 photographer Leon Levson, and they settled in Johannesburg. Freda ran her husband's photographic business from their home, which was also the venue for a varied social life - and later a safe house for Nelson Mandela and others. </p> <p>In 1952, Freda became involved in the launch of the African National Congress and the South African Indian Congress's \"defiance campaign against unjust laws\". She had dreaded informing her disciplinarian mother that she was breaking the law - her family stayed clear of politics, especially anything to do with black political movements. Freda's added fear was to tell her mother that she was joining Patric Duncan - son of South Africa's first governor general, and leader of the South African Liberal party - in the act of defiance. Her family and the Duncans were close friends. The young Patric, considered a rebel, was not popular with Freda's family, and she had expected a thunderous rejection. \"Well,\" said her mother, \"I am glad he has turned out to be respectable.\" </p> <p>Thus did Freda join the protesters who entered the African location of Germiston without a permit. They were arrested, and she was jailed for four weeks. </p> <p>Freda's involvement in liberation politics had started in 1946 when she assisted the Reverend Michael Scott in his pioneering international campaign against South Africa. She took his dossier on the plight of the Namibians and his other campaign work and turned it into a powerful indictment - In Face Of Fear: Michael Scott's Challenge To South Africa (1950). </p> <p>In 1961 she handed over the administrative secretaryship of the Defence and Aid fund to her close friend Mary Benson. Her husband was ill, and they moved fleetingly to Malta in the hope of restoring his health. But he died in 1961 and she returned to London. It was there, in 1962, that Nelson Mandela visited her when he left his homeland, illegally, to rally support. Active in the Anti-Apartheid movement, in 1975 she produced her book South Africa: An Historical Introduction. </p> <p>On her 90th birthday a telegram arrived for Freda. It was from Mandela. He would, he wrote, always remember her steadfast efforts during the treason trials - and her courage and persistence over the years. She is survived by two stepchildren. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Freda Levson (Winifred May MacDonald Troup), author and campaigner, born November 21 1911; died October 7 2004</p>",
  "There's the candidate who thinks lesbianism is so rife that girls need escorts into toilets. There's the candidate who accused his opponent of looking like Saddam Hussein's son. And then there's the candidate who thinks single mothers should be banned from teaching. Welcome to the wacky world of the US Senate elections. <p>While the world's attention is fixed on the nail-biting contest between John Kerry and George Bush, out of the spotlight a series of hard-fought state elections are going on. At stake is the majority in the Senate - a event that has huge implications, no matter who wins the presidency. </p> <p>The Senate is currently controlled by the Republicans, who have 51 seats out of 100. Until recently they were expected to add to that majority, by taking the lion's share of the 34 seats up for grabs on November 2. Now, thanks in part to a string of Republican blunders, the Democrats spy a slim opening that may allow them to emerge as the overall victors. </p> <p>In Kentucky, the Republican incumbent, Jim Bunning, was seen as a shoo-in before he began to self-destruct, a process that ended with him telling a press conference he was still mentally fit. In between, Bunning accused Democrats of assaulting his wife, denied using an autocue during a TV debate (before admitting that he did) and failed to turn up for a later televised debate. </p> <p>But Bunning's biggest gaffe was to claim that his opponent Daniel Mongiardo, an Italian-American, looked like a son of Saddam Hussein. Mongiardo is closing on Bunning in the latest polls, portraying him as out of touch by showing footage of the Republican saying: \"I don't watch the national news, and I don't read the paper.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Alaska the Democrats have a slim lead, despite the state not electing a Democrat senator for 24 years. The Republican incumbent, Lisa Murkowski, was gifted the seat by her father when he became governor - a controversial move that has now rebounded against the Republicans. </p> <p>In Oklahoma a tough battle is going on, made bizarre by Republican candidate Tom Coburn repeating a claim that \"lesbianism is so rampant in some of the schools in south-east Oklahoma\" that schoolgirls are escorted to the bathroom. But then Coburn has also described the citizens of the state capital as \"crapheads\". </p> <p>Even down south, the Democrats are making a strong showing in places such as South Carolina - thanks to Republican candidate Jim DeMint's bungling campaign and his odd statement that gays and single mothers should not be allowed to teach in state schools. DeMint later apologised for the \"distraction\". </p> <p>The result is that in these states, and others such as Colorado and Florida, the Democrats may pick up enough seats to break the Republican grip on Congress. It's going to be a close-run thing, but there are precedents in what is known as \"split ticket\" voting. That is the propensity of electors to vote for a president from one party, and senators or representatives from another. </p> <p>Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan suffered from such ticket-splitting during their presidencies - both saw their party lose control of Congress by the end of their term. The sting in the tail to any George Bush victory this year may be that many voters back Bush in the \"war on terror\", but vote Democrat in their own backyard. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:richard.adams@theguardian.com\">richard.adams@ theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "Torturers in foreign countries can be sued for damages in the English courts, the court of appeal said yesterday in a judgment hailed by civil rights lawyers as a historic victory. <p>Four Britons who claim they were tortured in Saudi Arabia were given the right to pursue their cases against named Saudi officials. But the court ruled that the state of Saudi Arabia had immunity from civil proceedings. </p> <p>Geoffrey Bindman, the lawyer for three of the men, called it \"a tremendous judgment\". It was \"the civil equivalent to the Pinochet case\", he said, referring to the former Chilean dictator whom the courts ruled could be prosecuted for torture. </p> <p>He added: \"Torturers can now be brought before civil and the criminal courts. The impact will be felt worldwide.\" </p> <p>The case, before the Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips, sitting with Lord Justice Mance and Lord Justice Neuberger, involved two separate appeals. </p> <p>Ron Jones, an accountant, was kept in a Saudi detention centre for 67 days in 2001. He claims he was seized from his bed in hospital, where he was recovering from a bomb blast, and tortured into saying he planted the device. He said Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Aziz was the torturer. </p> <p>The others, Sandy Mitchell, Les Walker, and Bill Sampson, a British-Canadian, were arrested over bomb attacks at the end of 2000, which, the Saudis claimed, were part of a turf war of western alcohol dealers. </p> <p>The men say they were tortured into making confessions which were then broadcast on Saudi television. Mr Mitchell and Mr Sampson were sentenced to death but released last year. Besides trying to sue the policemen Major Ibrahim al-Dali and Lieutenant Khalid al-Saleh, they also named Colonel Mohamed al-Said, a jail governor and Prince Naif, the Saudi interior minister. </p> <p>After the hearing Mr Jones said: \"I am delighted with the ruling. I think that their lordships have made a monumental judgment. It's a magnificent step forward for [dealing with] human rights abusers.\" </p> <p>Mr Mitchell said: \"Obviously I'm pleased, not so much for the sake of ourselves but any other torture victims which Saudi Arabia might produce. It's a step in the right direction that they can't hide behind international law.\" </p> <p>At a press conference Mr Sampson said: \"This is a day I have dreamt about. For nearly four years, from the day they first began to abuse me, I have fought for this.\" He said he condemned the British government for its lack of support in pursuing their claims. </p> <p>At the heart of the case was the compatibility of English law and the European convention on human rights, article six of which gives everyone legal redress before the courts. </p> <p>Last July, Mr Jones's \u00a32m claim against the Saudi government was struck out under the State Immunity Act 1978. The same ruling was applied to the other three men who wanted to proceed only against named individuals. </p> <p>But the court of appeal judges ruled that it could \"no longer be appropriate to give blanket effect to a foreign state's claim to state immunity ... in respect of a state official alleged to have committed acts of systematic torture\". </p> <p>The three judges dismissed Mr Jones's claim against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia but allowed the appeals of all four against the refusal to proceed against the individuals. </p> <p>The case is now likely to go to the Lords.</p>",
  "Five law lords unanimously endorsed the lifting of a high court injunction yesterday which would have banned the media from naming a woman accused of murdering her child when her trial begins next month. <p>The family division of the high court granted the injunction to protect the woman's surviving child, and that part remains in force, preventing the media identifying him or his mother in reporting yesterday's ruling. </p> <p>But the original injunction granted by Mr Justice Hedley also prevented the woman being named during her trial on a charge of murdering her nine-year-old son with a salt overdose. </p> <p>He lifted that part, after an application by an Essex newspaper, the Romford Recorder. </p> <p>The child's guardian, represented by Cherie Booth QC, took the case to the court of appeal, which rejected the appeal by a two-to-one majority, and then to the House of Lords. </p> <p>Yesterday Lords Bingham, Nicholls, Steyn, Hoffmann and Carswell unanimously rejected the appeal. </p> <p>They ruled that the courts had no power to create new exceptions to the general prin ciple of open justice except in the most compelling circumstances. Lord Steyn said that an injunction to protect someone not involved in the case was \"a step too far\" which, if permitted, \"would seriously impoverish public discussion of criminal justice\". </p> <p>The injunction protecting the surviving child remains in place, but there is now no bar on naming the woman and the son she is charged with murdering, or using their photographs, during her trial. </p> <p>Lord Steyn said the child would not be directly involved in the trial: he was not a witness, and there would be no need to refer to him.</p>",
  "It is vital to be sensitive to context when analysing the Knesset's approval of Ariel Sharon's disengagement plan from Gaza (I'm backing Sharon, October 27). For this landmark vote comes only six months after Sharon's declaration, immediately endorsed by George Bush, that six major settlement blocs in the West Bank would remain under Israel's control \"for all eternity\". <p>In arrogating to themselves this right to decide which Israeli settlements shall and shall not remain on confiscated Palestinian land, Sharon and Bush apparently ignored international law and UN security council resolutions declaring all these settlements and outposts to be illegal. </p> <p>Peace and justice for both Palestinians and Israelis have a greater chance of achievement if the rule of law - as opposed to unilateral decisions sanctioning illegality - shape the resolution of this tragic conflict. The starting point for any solution of the settlements issue is that international law requires their evacuation and dismantling. </p> <p>So the planned Gaza with drawal may only be genuinely applauded on the condition it does not represent an exchange allowing Sharon's Israel to indefinitely retain vast settlements in the West Bank. Real and long-lasting peace is unlikely to flow from such a flawed and illegal solution to the settlement issue.<br><b> Tareq Shrourou</b><br> Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights </p> <p>Jonathan Freedland's blast of cold air was prefaced by the almost locked-in cycle of reciprocal violence perpetuated by those who rejected peace negotiations. Yet most Israelis - according to all the polls - want a peace process. And so do most Palestinians. The choices are either \"peace on my terms\", or \"peace at a price\". A template exists for the latter: the Geneva accord unveiled in December 2003 with two states for two people (2for2) at its heart. </p> <p>I witnessed the secret intensive and painful efforts by Israelis and Palestinians who negotiated in Geneva. It provides a real basis for a genuine process to resolve the conflict. It undermined Sharon's \"there's no partner\" mantra and forced him to respond to the accord with his Gaza proposal. We support the withdrawal. But Gaza first must not become Gaza last. 2for2 is still the only rational outcome - and negotiations are the only way to achieve it. <br><b> Paul Usiskin</b><br> Chair, Peace Now UK </p> <p>It might seem to many that the Israeli settlers are making a \"painful sacrifice\". But Israel's Jewish-only settlements were and are built on stolen Palestinian lands - my own family has lost much of our ancestral lands to these settlements - and Sharon is known widely as the god-father of the settlements (Has Sharon moved from villain to visionary? October 27). </p> <p>I find it rather ridiculous that we, overburdened US taxpayers, who directly or indirectly paid for these illegal settlements through the billions of dollars of aid that we give to Israel annually, will be asked to foot the bill for the compensation (about $400, 000 a family) and the relocation of these settlers to existing or new settlements in the occupied West Bank. </p> <p>The \"disengagement plan\" is nothing more than an all-out effort to make Gaza an open-air prison, de-facto annex most of the West Bank, prevent the creation of a Palestinian state, and nullify any hope for a just and lasting peace. <br><b> Mike Odetalla </b><br>Canton, Michigan, USA </p> <p>Jonathan Freedland says, \"At long last, Israel is proposing to rid itself of part of the territory it won in 1967\".

  "Palestinians are well-prepared for the death of Yasser Arafat. Through television reports of foreigners paying homage at Mr Arafat's battered compound and prison, Palestinians have watched their 75-year-old leader degenerate into a feeble, shaking and often incoherent shadow over the past two years. <p>Many Palestinians are also ready for his passing on another level. \"The Palestinian people are ready both emotionally and practically,\" said Qadura Fares, a Palestinian MP and senior member of Mr Arafat's Fatah movement. </p> <p>But Mr Arafat has done little to prepare the system he dominates for his demise. He wields unchallenged authority over every major institution - the Palestinian Authority, the Palestine Liberation Organisation and an array of armed forces - through a system of loyalty, patronage and fear. </p> <p>He entrenched his control by assuring that no potential rivals grew strong enough to challenge his authority, and no single figure is likely to emerge to replace him in those roles. </p> <p>Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian MP and former peace negotiator, said that could produce \"disorder, rivalries and vying for power\" once Mr Arafat is gone. </p> <p>\"Arafat is a larger-than-life symbolic leader, which is a rare breed these days. He cannot be replaced,\" she said. </p> <p>\"You must remember that the situation in the West Bank and Gaza has been one of fragmentation and deterioration for a long time now. We cannot predict whether there will be further chaos and deterioration, or whether we will rise to the challenge in front of us.\" </p> <p>The political earthquake produced by Mr Arafat's death could open the way for a younger generation of Palestinian politicians intent on breaking with the authoritarian and often chaotic strategies of an administration run as a liberation struggle in favour of more structured and accountable government. </p> <p>For a while before the latest intifada, the reformists and public opinion had Mr Arafat in retreat. But he thwarted them amid the resurgent violence and the insistence of Israel and the US that the Palestinian leader was the central obstacle to negotiation and had to be removed from power. It only strengthened his control. </p> <p>Who - and what - emerges will play an important role in deciding whether Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, can maintain his position that there is no one to negotiate with and continue to pursue the \"unilateral disengagement plan\" that many Palestinians fear is a strategy to rob them of more land. </p> <p>\"Arafat's death will remove that roadblock,\" said Barry Rubin, an Israeli biographer of the Palestinian leader. </p> <p>\"The problem then becomes will there be a leader or leadership that can make decisions. There is going to be a power struggle, whether you have a leader who wants to make a deal, and whether he can make a deal.\" </p> <p>In the event of Mr Arafat's death, the basic law appoints the speaker of parliament as president of the Palestinian Authority for 60 days while elections are held. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's passing would also open a vacancy at the helm of the PLO. It is expected that the PLO's secretary general, Mahmoud Abbas, would be its new leader. Mr Abbas, who briefly served as prime minister last year, is likely to run for the presidency of the PA. He has the support of many in the Palestinian parliament, and the Americans and Europeans, but lacks backing among the Palestinian security organisations. </p> <p>He may face challenges from younger leaders, such as Marwan Barghouti, the Fatah leader serving multiple life terms in an Israeli prison, Mohammed Dahlan, the former security chief in Gaza who is favoured by Britain, and Jibril Rajoub, Mr Arafat's security adviser. </p> <p>In recent weeks, Palestinians have been registering in preparation for local elections in December and a presidential ballot scheduled for March. </p> <p>\"If the law is followed, I think the change will be smooth and the Palestinians will choose a new leader who will serve them much better than Arafat,\" said Abdel Jawad Saleh, a Palestinian MP and former cabinet minister who broke with Mr Arafat because of the violence and corruption. </p> <p>\"But there are other interests at work. The Israelis may not want elections because chaos suits Sharon. He can continue to say there is no one to negotiate with. If the Israelis are interested in elections and they lift the closure and the checkpoints and everybody can move, then I think there can be credible elections.\" </p> <p>But if the transition degenerates over the ballot - or the lack of one - it is likely that Mr Sharon will keep up his mantra that there is no one to negotiate with. </p> <p>The Palestinian leadership and its rivals in organisations such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad say there is little appetite for civil war. But the Islamist groups may move to consolidate control of areas where they are dominant, driving out forces loyal to the PA, which they view as a collaborationist organisation. </p> <p>How the PA evolves could have a profound effect on Hamas in particular. It has built a political base around the PA's failings, playing on popular resentment of its corruption, inefficiency and the favouring of people and areas linked to Fatah in the delivery of services such as health. </p> <p>If the PA continues to crumble, Hamas will be strengthened. But if the patronage and other abuses are curbed, the Islamist groups will be undercut. </p> <p>The real potential for bloodletting is settling scores against those elevated and protected by Mr Arafat. </p> <p>The anger bubbling under the surface across the Palestinian territories burst to the surface in Gaza last month when the Palestinian leader attempted to promote a cousin, Moussa Arafat, to head the security forces there.</p>",

  "Any battle to succeed Yasser Arafat would be fought initially among the older generation of Palestinian politicians and fighters who spent most of their lives in exile with the president. <p>But the real battle will be within a younger, homegrown generation of politicians who were brought up and raised in the West Bank and Gaza. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's likeliest successors are Mahmoud Abbas, better known as Abu Mazen, and Ahmed Qureia, known as Abu Ala. </p> <p>The new generation, leaders such as Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan, may make way for the two Abus this time round, with Mr Mazen possibly taking charge of the PLO and Mr Ala as president of the Palestinian Authority. But Mr Rajoub and Mr Dahlan will be preparing their future bids, as they have been for the past few years. </p> <p>Marwan Barghouti - another, more popular, member of that generation and the most likely long-term successor - is still in jail in Israel. </p> <p><b> Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen)</b><br> </p> <p> A strong contender to become leader of the PLO, the 69-year-old would be the US and Israeli choice, regarded by them as likely to crack down on groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. </p> <p>He was in exile with Mr Arafat in Tunis but ties between the two are fraught and he refused to return to Gaza with Mr Arafat in 1994. </p> <p>He finally returned to the West Bank last year to become prime minister but was too weak to stand up to Mr Arafat or wring concessions out of the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon. After four months, he resigned. </p> <p>He had an operation for cancer three years ago. </p> <p><b> Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala)</b><br> </p> <p> The 66-year-old is a reluctant prime minister, frequently on the verge of handing in his resignation because of interference by Mr Arafat. </p> <p>Like Abu Mazen, he is regarded by the Israel government as someone that it could do business with. He was one of the architects of the Oslo peace process. </p> <p>Lacking charisma, he has little support at the popular level. This left him exposed during in-fighting with Mr Arafat this year. </p> <p>He admitted this weakness in an interview a fortnight ago with journalists. </p> <p>He said: \"You have a president who is in prison and a prime minister who is free and not free, who can move about but does not have the authority to solve problems. I am not a professional politician and, maybe, my skin is not thick enough.\" </p> <p><b> Marwan Barghouti</b><br> </p> <p> The 45-year-old is the best known of the new generation of homegrown Palestinian leaders. Unlike Abu Mazen and Abu Ala, he was brought up and spent most of his life in the West Bank. </p> <p>He demonstrated his leadership qualities during the first Palestinian uprising of 1987-1993 and is one of the main leaders of the second intifada that began in September 2000. </p> <p>He opposed suicide bombings and other attacks inside Israel and advocated confining Palestinian attacks to the West Bank and Gaza. </p> <p>He was captured by the Israelis in 2002 and is currently serving long jail sentences after he was subsequently found guilty of multiple murders. </p> <p>His conduct during his trial and the fact he is in prison has helped boost his popularity among Palestinians. He will almost certainly do well if he chooses to stand as a candidate from his cell. </p> <p>The Israeli government will determine his fate. If the politicians believe that Mr Barghouti is prepared to reach a deal with Israel, they could release him early. If they decide he will cause more trouble, he will remain in prison. </p> <p><b> Mohammed Dahlan</b><br> </p> <p> At 43, he is another homegrown Palestinian, born in Khan Yunis, in Gaza. Where Mr Barghouti's powerbase is in the West Bank, Mr Dahlan seeks control of Gaza. </p> <p>Arrested six times by the Israelis, he was deported to Tunis, returning in 1993. </p> <p>He was in charge of the Palestinian Authority's security apparatus in Gaza until he fell out of favour with Mr Arafat, who saw his reform proposals as an act of betrayal. </p> <p>He is a polished political performer who is liked by the US, Israeli and British governments. Britain last year facilitated study leave for him in the UK while he was out of favour with Mr Arafat. </p> <p>He has made many enemies among fellow Palestinians, especially on the West Bank. When British journalists asked Hakam Balawi, the Palestinian interior minister, about Mr Dahlan as a potential successor, he was emphatic: \"No. No. A thousand times no.\" </p> <p>Mr Dahlan has continued to build support in Gaza, where the Palestinian Authority has to contend for power with Hamas and Islamic Jihad. </p> <p><b> Jibril Rajoub</b><br> </p> <p> Aged 51, he is almost a mirror image of Mr Dahlan on the West Bank. He was in charge of security in the area until he too fell out of favour. </p> <p>He was deemed by Mr Arafat to have failed to put up enough of a fight against the Israeli incursion in 2002, especially his failure to remain in the fortress-like police headquarters in Ramallah. He is now back in favour. </p> <p>Mr Rajoub, like Mr Dahlan, is still in close contact with counterparts in Israeli intelligence. Mr Arafat this month teased him, claiming he was in secret talks with Ariel Sharon through his son Omri. </p> <p>Mr Rajoub spent 17 years in Israeli jails. He also went to Tunis with Mr Arafat. </p> <p>He is apparently opposed to attacks on civilians, either in Israel or on Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>",
  "<p>Nymex crude futures down $1.80 a barrel, <strong>Shell Transport &amp; Trading</strong> up 2.85% - explain. </p> <p>That was the paradox City traders were wrestling with yesterday as the Anglo-Dutch oil company registered the fourth biggest rise in a strong FTSE 100 . </p> <p>The conclusion they came to is that today's third-quarter figures from Shell will either be accompanied by an enormous disposal or its eagerly awaited strategic review. </p> <p>In response to the reserves scandal in January, Shell, which is made up of two companies - Shell Transport &amp; Trading and Royal Dutch Shell - launched an in-depth review of its byzantine corporate structure and complex decision-making processes. </p> <p>Following pressure from shareholders it was forced to reveal in June that the review centred on a \"possible\" simplification of its board and corporate structure. </p> <p>At the time the company insisted that nothing, including a unified board to which a single chief executive would report, had been ruled out. It said details of the review would not be made public until November. </p> <p>The word in the Square Mile late yesterday was that the company had been tempted to publish the report with today's figures, which should benefit from the high oil price. </p> <p>Excited by rumours that the report could trigger a \"re-rating\", Shell shares closed 11.25p higher at 423.75p, outperforming rival <strong>BP</strong>, which managed to rise just 4.5p to 535.5p. </p> <p>In the wider market, leading shares chalked up their biggest gains in nearly a month as the oil price fell sharply from its recent record high. </p> <p>The final scores showed the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> up 46.7 points at 4630.1. The hedge fund manager <strong>Man Group</strong>, which was 42p stronger at \u00a313.19, became the top performer as the City had its first chance to react to Tuesday's after-hours news that the value of Man's leading AHL fund had risen 4.2% last week. </p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 250</strong> advanced 45.5 points to close at 6322.5, while the <strong>FTSE Small Cap</strong> index added 4.8 points to 2593.3. </p> <p>In the bond market, gilts fell sharply. The benchmark 10-year gilt closed at 102.250, yielding 4.711%. </p> <p><strong>BT</strong> finally emerged from the doldrums yesterday. Its shares, which have traded within a 10p band since early August, gained 3.25p to 183.75p after joint house broker Cazenove upgraded to in line from underperform, ahead of next month's half-year figures. </p> <p>Paul Howard, a Cazenove analyst, said: \"We believe BT's interim figures might be marginally stronger than expected due to a slight improvement in consumer trends and good cost control. There is also an outside chance that BT might further develop its shareholder returns policy.\" </p> <p>The leisure group <strong>Whitbread</strong> eased 3p to 831p. Dealers said a number of hedge funds had sold Whitbread short yesterday on the back of rumours that this morning's strategic review might not be as radical as had been hoped. </p> <p>The pubs and brewing group <strong>Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley</strong>, off 25p at 905p, was among the biggest fallers in the FTSE 250 after Arbuthnot Securities advised clients to switch into <strong>Greene King</strong>, up 42p to \u00a311.38. The broker reckons W&amp;D's superior stock market rating is difficult to justify given Greene King's more impressive track record and stronger projected earnings growth. </p> <p>The budget airline <strong>easyJet</strong> eased 1p to 157.75p, hit by profit-taking and rumours that Icelandair has instructed its stockbroker, Teather &amp; Greenwood, to buy more shares only if the price fell below 155p. </p> <p>Icelandair has built a 10% stake in easyJet over the past week, fuelling speculation that a bid might be on the cards. </p> <p><strong>N Brown</strong>, the mail-order specialist, was in demand again as Tuesday's buy-out speculation refused to die down, despite sources close to the company claiming that the chairman and majority shareholder, David Alliance, has no plans to take the group private. </p> <p>However, the joint house broker, ABN Amro, was heard telling clients that if Mr Alliance were to take N Brown private, now would be an opportune moment to do so given that the market continued to undervalue the company's credit activities. \"Clearly, private equity interest has been rife in the sector, so, given recent valuation levels and the size of the debtor book, it seems inconceivable that private equity houses have not at least run the slide rule over this business,\" ABN said. </p> <p>N Brown shares rose 5.25p to 133p. </p> <p>Among the small caps, the packaging firm <strong>API Group</strong> improved 4.5p to 90.5p after Steel Partners, the aggressive US investment fund run by the Wall Street legend Warren Lichtenstein, announced that it had increased its holding from 12.4% to 14.2%.

  "<b> Heroes and villains</b> <br> <p><b> Last night John Peel saved my life</b><br> In 1988, when I was 19, I lived in Washington DC for four months. I would go to see bands at the local alternative hangout, which chucked out in the early hours on to streets too close to Taxi Driver for my comfort. I would walk down to Pennsylvania Avenue, where I was confident I'd be able to hail a cab, past a row of sex shops. </p> <p>One night, some very large men in sportswear and gold chains were loitering outside the sex shops. Two fell into step either side of me. </p> <p>\"You want some crack?\" one asked. </p> <p>\"I'm fine, thanks, actually,\" I replied (I was a nice boy). </p> <p>\"You want some smack?\" </p> <p>\"No, thanks. I'm alright.\" </p> <p>One of the young men stepped in front of me, forcing me to halt. </p> <p>\"You ain't all right,\" he said. I swear I nearly fainted. \"We want your money, anyway, boy.\" </p> <p>I took out my wallet and showed them it was empty. I turned out my trouser pockets - maybe five bucks in change. I didn't tell them about the 10 in my shirt pocket, the 10 I had saved for my cab fare home. </p> <p>\"This ain't funny, boy.\" </p> <p>\"I'm sorry,\" I squeaked. I mean squeaked. \"That's all I've got.\" </p> <p>The three of us stood on the cold street in the dead of night. </p> <p>\"You English, ain't you, boy?\" one of them finally said. </p> <p>\"I am, yes.\" </p> <p>They paused. Then one asked: \"You like reggae?\" </p> <p>I didn't. I hated it. But I had spent the weekday nights of my mid-teens in bed, the light off and the headphones on, listening to Peel. At last, a use for the knowledge he'd imparted, but which I'd always thought was pointless. </p> <p>\"I love reggae,\" I gushed. </p> <p>\"Who do you like?\" </p> <p>\"Barrington Levy, Augustus Pablo, Wayne Smith, Sugar Minott, Ijahman Levy, Yellowman - I love it all.\" </p> <p>\"Whass your favourite record?\" </p> <p>\"Prison Oval Rock, Barrington.\" </p> <p>\"You like UB40?\" one asked. </p> <p>\"No,\" I said. \"Can't stand them.\" (Sometimes you have to be true to yourself.) </p> <p>\"You don't like UB40?\" </p> <p>\"You've got to understand,\" I said. \"In England, UB40 is student reggae. You don't get serious reggae fans buying that. They're a chart pop group.\" </p> <p>\"I never knew that,\" one said, with wonder in his voice. </p> <p>\"Damn,\" said the other. \"Those guys on my block think UB40's the shit. They have to know this.\" </p> <p>They talked among themselves for a moment about whether they had misjudged the authenticity of UB40, then one turned to me. </p> <p>\"You go now, boy. And you be careful, y'hear? You shouldn't be out here this time o'night.\" </p> <p>Thanks, John. The tale about how a Peel session led, eventually, to me trying to get the US Congress to designate a National Ukrainian American Day can wait for another time. <br><b>Michael Hann</b> </p> <p><b> Food and drink</b><br> </p> <p><b> I'm a WMD, eat me</b><br> It's the middle of Ramadan in the Middle East and everyone is in holiday mode. The nights are balmy and each evening, after a long, sleepy day of fasting, the streets are packed with throngs of people going to concerts, walking along the corniche or visiting friends. Ramadan is not just a time for socialising: just like Christmas it is also a time for overeating, and in the al-Sahel wholesale souk on the northern edge of Cairo, huge sacks of fruit are arriving on lorries from upper Egypt, destined for the Ramadan dinner table. </p> <p>There is a tradition in the Middle East that the dates that come to market during Ramadan are given topical names as a marketing ploy. The fatter and sweeter the date, the more valuable it is - and the more prestigious the name attached. Usually these names reflect current events. Last year the big sellers were Saddam Hussein dates, seconded only by Jacques Chirac dates, with George Bush dates - small, shrivelled and tasteless - coming in last. This year Bush dates still feature, but Jacques Chirac dates have all but disappeared, perhaps because of the introduction of the headscarf ban. So have Weapons of Mass Destruction dates. </p> <p>The big sellers this year are Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein dates - both varieties are big, fat, juicy and red. Each check in at an extravagant 30 Egyptian pounds a kilo (about \u00a32.60). Abu Musab Zarqawi dates are also a big hit, but cost a fraction less at about \u00a32.20. Nancy Ajram dates, a busty Lebanese pop singer and a household name in the Arab world, also features large. \"I want a kilo of Nancy Ajram,\" always gets a giggle in the souk. </p> <p>But it's not all terrorists and pop stars. Bush and Ariel Sharon dates are still the cheapest, at two Egyptian pounds per kilo - slightly less than 20p. \"They're cheap like George Bush,\" says the shopkeeper. Still, he concedes, they were the first to sell out. </p> <p>There are also some new contenders in this Egyptian version of a Mori poll. Viagra dates come in at a more sensibly priced 80p a kilo - about the same price as Intifada dates or John Kerry dates. \"We call them John Kerry dates because they look like John Kerry,\" says the shopkeeper, holding one up for me to inspect. \"They are long and thin like his chin.\" There was a certain resemblance, I agree. \"What do you call the fruit in England?\" he asks. \"Granny Smith,\" I replied. \"Is she in the government?\" Bearing in mind the Arab view of the British government, she might as well be. <b><b>Hugh Miles</b> </b></p> <p><b><b> In the House</b><br> </b></p> <p><b><b> Don't talk to strangers</b><br> It looks as if the Commons is going to drop the archaic term \"strangers\" for visitors - ie tourists and the British voters who put the MPs there in the first place and pay their lavish expenses. It will be replaced by the anodyne \"members of the public\", as in \"public gallery\" and, presumably, \"public bar\". At least we are spared \"customers\", and miraculously, given New Labour's love of jargon, \"stakeholders\". </b></p> <p><b>Perhaps, these days, the term seems pejorative, with its implications of \"strange\" or \"outsider\", though when it was first used in February 1575, it was a neutral word derived from the French etrangere .

What is a 10-minute rule bill? (A bill whose supporter has 10 minutes to make a case for it; it has roughly a one-in-ten-thousand chance of becoming law.) </b></p> <p><b>In debate, MPs are still called \"the honourable member\" or \"my right honourable friend\", and an MP who is a QC, a serving officer and a member of the Privy Council gets the full monty: \"My learned, gallant and right honourable friend.\" You don't hear that much any more. These days some members, such as Gordon Prentice (Lab), have privately dropped the \"honourable\" and talk about \"my friend\" - he used that term of the prime minister yesterday while asking a question that will have certainly got himself dropped from his \"friend's\" Christmas-card list. </b></p> <p><b>All very sensible no doubt, if you want the world's oldest functionaing parliament to sound like a Kwik-Fit exhaust centre, or a Harvester restaurant (\"Good afternoon, have you been to a legislature before?\").

There are two kinds of drugs: terrible immoral addictive drugs, and the ones you take. Nearly everyone's on something - coffee use being particularly widespread; it might seem harmless but that's down to marketing. Try getting off it - if you're on six cups a day and stop suddenly you're liable to get migraines. I drank a whole jar of it once, just to see. Mid tour, having run out of the hard stuff and exhausted, we spied a jar of instant coffee in the dressing room and thought, \"What the hell.\" And we were right.

  "The unmaking of the president 2004 began on September 11 2001. By September 10, George Bush's poll numbers had reached 50%, the lowest of any president at that early point in his tenure. Having lost the popular majority in the 2000 election and being delivered the presidency by a five-to-four Supreme Court decision, Bush operated as though he had triumphed with a full-throated mandate. <p>From the start, Bush ran a government based on secrecy, handed over the departments and agencies to more than 100 industry executives and lobbyists appointed to key positions, and exhibited belligerence towards anyone who raised a question about his right-wing imperatives. His bullying prompted Republican Senator James Jeffords of Vermont to cross the aisle, throwing control of the Senate to the Democrats. In only months, Bush's incompetence and arrogance had induced paralysis. He had already run his course. </p> <p>After September 11, as his poll numbers soared, Bush wrapped his radical agenda in the cloak of commander-in-chief. Now he would attempt to implement Karl Rove's ambition of a one-party state and the neo-conservatives' plan for an American imperium. Bush believed he had permanent political capital to forge a factional partisan political realignment. Afghanistan, almost unanimously supported in the country, solidified his popularity and certainty. </p> <p>The conservative wish-list came off the shelf. Civil liberties were curtailed in the Patriot Act, extremists were nominated as federal judges, environmental protections ravaged, and resources shifted from Afghanistan to prepare for Bush's ultimate objective - Iraq. </p> <p>The mid-term elections of 2002 ratified Bush's hyper-radicalism. In the face of the \"war president\", the congressional Democratic leadership demonstrated political ineptitude, division and confusion, and the Republicans tarred them as unpatriotic. Bush's belief in his inevitability became more intoxicating. </p> <p>After the Iraq \"cakewalk\", Bush landed on an aircraft carrier in uniform, proclaiming: \"Mission accomplished.\" At home, he encountered no checks and balances from Congress. The fourth estate conducted press conferences as though suffering aphasia. </p> <p>The testimony of Richard Clarke, former counterterrorism chief, that the Bush administration had been indifferent to terrorism, shattered the atmosphere of silent obedience. His truth-telling encouraged the revolt of professionals throughout the national security bureaucracies - the CIA and other intelligence services, the military, and the State Department. Then the rationales for the war crumbled when no WMD were found and the \"cakewalk\" turned into a bloody quagmire. </p> <p>Suddenly, the Democrats came to life, providing a forum and focus for outrage against Bush's policies. At first, the movement gathered around Howard Dean, but with his stumbles he was not the man for the mission. Bush had counted on the Democrats once again picking an earnest but easily defeated candidate, but they turned instead to John Kerry. </p> <p>From March and through the early summer, Bush's campaign spent more than $100m in negative commercials trying to disqualify Kerry. Yet Kerry remained even, and with the Democratic convention pulled slightly ahead. </p> <p>In a typical Bush operation, he outsourced the smears to a group that filled the airwaves with lies about Kerry's genuine record of war heroism in Vietnam. The media, mostly cable TV, acted as conduit for Bush's falsehoods, and Kerry was tarnished. At the Republican convention, speaker after speaker stressed the Democrats' effeminacy - \"girly men\" - and hailed Bush as all-wise commander-in-chief. Once again, Bush believed he was impregnable. </p> <p>All he had to do was finesse the debates. But he was humiliated in all three. Kerry, however, possessed clarity, intelligence and maturity. Bush's response was a new ad, featuring wolves about to leap through the TV screen. But the projection of fear only exposed his vulnerability. </p> <p>The \"war president\" has fallen victim to his own hubris. As Thucydides wrote: \"To conceive extravagant pretensions from success in war is to forget how hollow is the confidence by which you are elated. For if many ill-conceived plans have succeeded through the still greater fatuity of an oppo nent, many more, apparently well laid, have on the contrary ended in disgrace.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the people's own mobilisation has produced new voter registrations in the millions, and hundreds of thousands of activists have spread in the last week throughout the battleground states. The Republicans desperately cast out ploys to suppress these voters, many of them African-American. In the end, the American people refuse to be frightened into becoming an unrecognisable nation that disdains, as the Declaration of Independence said, \"a decent respect to the opinions of mankind\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com&quot;\">salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal @yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal @yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Frederick Ashton's Two Pigeons is a ballet that's always divided audiences. While fans are charmed by the fantasy in which its story of troubled young love is echoed by the pair of live pigeons fluttering on stage, sceptics see too much of the choreography reverting to a default level of cuteness </p> <p>At the end of BRB's performance on Tuesday, one pigeon was clearly siding with the sceptics. It refused to join its partner for the ballet's final valentine tableaux, preferring to strut around the stage instead. This one-bird rebellion provided wonderful comedy for the audience but it was bad luck for the human cast, who'd been working pretty hard to endorse the ballet's romantic vision. </p> <p>Nao Sakuma as the Young Girl struggling to retain her boyfriend's heart might have begun by pitching her role on the wrong side of pert, but she's a natural Ashton dancer and as she makes her crude, frightened attempts to ape the seductive moves of her Gypsy Girl rival, her performance deepens detail by detail. Robert Parker as her errant lover slightly overdoes his tousle-haired-boy act but his self-absorbed prattishness is convincing and well matched by Molly Smolen's tough cynical Gypsy Girl. Smolen's footwork is a little crude for Ashton but the natural feisty power of her dancing brings the scent of a different harder world to the stage. Her fellow Gypsies have a hard time, though, for no cast in the world can redeem Ashton's unconvincingly sexed up routines from being anything but bad choreographic fancy dress. </p> <p>Balanchine created his own fancy dress ballet in the classic 1954 cowboy romp Western Symphony.

  "What does a Satanist do? Although the question is obviously more pressing when the Satanist in question occupies a neighbouring bunk, the crew members of HMS Cumberland cannot be the only people curious about the worshipping style favoured by Leading Hand Chris Cranmer, the naval technician who has just been granted permission to practise his faith on board a Royal Navy frigate. <p>With their learned debates on incest and the the correct spelling of Shemhamforash!, Satanist websites shed little immediate light on the likely congruence between satanic observances and a life on the open sea. Better perhaps to begin with the text that captivated Cranmer when he came across it nine years ago: Anton Szandor LaVey's Satanic Bible. It was, apparently, Cranmer's desire to \"relax in bed\" with a copy of this bible (as well as a reluctance to bite his tongue \"with idiots\") that impelled him to register as a Satanist. </p> <p>Thanks to the navy's enlightened attitudes we can now picture Cranmer, in his bunk, quietly meditating on his spiritual leader's injunction to \"hate your enemies with a whole heart, and if a man smite you on one cheek, SMASH him on the other!\" LaVey's biographer, Burton H Wolfe, has summarised the satanist creed as \"a blatantly selfish, brutal philosophy ... based on the belief that life is a Darwinian struggle for survival of the fittest\". Although such organised self-assertion is certainly less alarming than the infant sacrifice and blood-drinking often erroneously associated with LaVey's Satanism, one wonders if the navy has really confronted the difficulties that could arise when the contempt for inferiors that characterises the devout Satanist conflicts with nautical discipline. The prohibition on \"herd conformity\", number five in LaVey's list of satanic sins, rules out any question of submission. </p> <p>Could a Satanist, whose ambition is to proclaim, \"Bow down, for I am the highest embodiment of human life!\", ever be truly happy repeating \"Aye aye, sir\"? Not to mention the hornpipe? If I were a senior officer on HMS Cumberland I might want to start making regular checks for effigies, removing any that may, in an excess of religious zeal, have been punctured in the approved LaVey style, with pins or nails. </p> <p>After publishing his bible in 1969, LaVey (whose real name was Howard Stanton Levey), composed a companion volume, The Satanic Rituals, from which Leading Hand Cranmer will presumably be selecting the ceremonies he is now licensed to perform. </p> <p>Since the navy is an equal opportunities employer, there may not be much difficulty in finding a naked female rating to use as an altar. \"A nude woman is used as the altar in satanic rituals,\" Lavey explains in his bible, \"because woman is the passive receptor and represents the earth mother.\" Instead, the chief problem is likely to be one of space, for in comparison with Christian or Muslim rites, the simplest satanic rituals seem to require enormous quantities of kit, something that may not always harmonise with operational effectiveness. </p> <p>To enact even the most basic satanic ritual, Cranmer will need black robes (cowled or hooded); a symbol of Baphomet (\"the Powers of Darkness combined with the generative fertility of the goat\"); both black and white candles; a bell (\"the tonal quality should be loud and penetrating\"); a chalice (\"anything but gold\"); elixir (\"whatever drink is most stimulating and pleasing to the palate\"); sword (or \"long knife, cane, or similar staff\"); phallus (\"one may be made from plaster, wood, clay, wax, etc\"); gong (\"a concert gong is preferred\"); and parchment (\"plain paper may be substituted\"). </p> <p>For the more imposing rites, such as the Ceremony of the Stifling Air, Cranmer must also source (in addition to many minor props, including a goblet, cruet and cat o'nine tails) a coffin - \"a traditional hexagonal style is recommended\". LaVey adds that it must be \"large enough to contain two persons\", one of whom will be a woman who is required to \"beckon seductively\". Another ceremony requires \"entire animal heads made of papier mache\" and a mouse in a cage. A human arm-, or legbone will have to be requisitioned for the Russian-themed Homage to Tchort: \"I am a thrusting rod with head of iron, drawing to me myriad nymphs, tumescent in their craving!\" </p> <p>Although the prancing, ringing and gonging that accompanies these rituals is, no doubt, strictly harmless, sailors who overhear Cranmer shouting, \"I am rampant carnal joy!\" in the next cabin may not feel totally at ease. There is also the impact on morale to consider should he decide to try out a magical technique which involves concealing a dead mackerel in his trousers. LaVey, a man with a disturbing dirty-underwear fetish, urges his Bible readers to use smell - or not-washing - as an \"important manipulative factor in lesser magic\". Perhaps a whitebait would do the trick. </p> <p>Can Cranmer's fellow crew members feel confident that they will not become a human sacrifice? Not altogether. In the Satanic Bible, LaVey does not shrink from asking, \"Who, then, would be considered a fit and proper human sacrifice?\" The answer, he says, is \"brutally simple. Anyone who has unjustly wronged you ... In short, a person asking to be cursed by their very actions.\" Were the Cumberland ever to engage in formal hostilities, this cursing (instructions are included) could obviously be quite advantageous: \"I call upon the messengers of doom to slash with grim delight this victim I have chosen.\" Although it remains to be seen if it would work on people who are widely considered to be evil high-achievers themselves - Osama bin Laden, for instance. </p> <p>But even if Ldg Hand Cranmer is unable to eliminate enemies using invisible, impressively economical Conjurations of Destruction, he has earned our gratitude. The sanctioning of LaVey's smutty hocus pocus on board HMS Cumberland not only illustrates how unattractive a belief system may be while still earning official respect; it hints at the difficulties we may soon face in criticising anything that calls itself a religion. </p> <p>Happily, with Blunkett's law against inciting religious hatred still only a threat, it is still legal to argue that Satanism, which was invented by the absurd LaVey in 1966, is far too silly, and smelly, to deserve protected faith status. And if the only way to subdue the claims of particularly idiotic or offensive religions is to exclude the whole lot of them from public life, then - as the devil worshippers of my acquaintance like to put it - so mote it be. </p> <p><b>Stoob ni Ssup - the real Cherie story</b></p> <p>Five years ago, the sociologist Professor Jonathan Gershuny introduced participants at a Downing Street seminar to the notion of the \"Allerednic\", or reverse Cinderella effect, whereby a prince marries a princess and turns her into a scullery maid. </p> <p>It clearly made a great impression on Cherie Blair, so much so that she alluded to the syndrome on her American lecture tour this week - admitting that in her own household, it has tended to be her husband who gets pressed into domestic drudgery. </p> <p>In fact, Professor Gershuny's theory now has so little bearing on Mrs Blair's circumstances that you feel there must be another fairy story whose inversion more aptly illustrates her own, amazing journey from Liverpudlian obscurity to world domination. Skcolidlog, perhaps, in which our heroine does not run away at the end, but scares off the bears, settles into their house, and eats all the porridge? Or Dooh Gnidir Der, in which the little girl opens wide, and gobbles up the wolf? </p> <p>The most illuminating appropriate inversion, however, is surely Stoob ni Ssup, in which artful Puss, having guided the handsome, but not altogether bright Marquis of Carabas to fame and fortune, neatly pushes her protege to one side, writes a book on important cats, and claims the riches and acclaim that are her due.</p>",
  "Four Britons who claim they were repeatedly tortured at Guant\u00e1namo Bay yesterday began suing Donald Rumsfeld and other US military leaders for \u00a36m each in compensation. <p>Defendants in the law suit also include the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Richard Myers, and the former head of the prison camp, Major General Geoffrey Miller, now in charge at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. </p> <p>The four Britons were released in March after spending nearly three years at Guant\u00e1namo in conditions that have been condemned by human rights groups. </p> <p>The action has been brought by the so-called Tipton three, Shafiq Rasul, Asif Iqbal and Rhuhel Ahmed, and Jamal al-Harith from Manchester. All deny links or involvement in terrorism. The law suit alleges the Britons were \"repeatedly struck with rifle butts, punched, kicked and slapped. They were short-shackled in painful stress positions for many hours ... causing deep flesh wounds and permanent scarring. </p> <p>\"Plaintiffs were also threatened with unmuzzled dogs, forced to strip naked, subjected to repeated forced body-cavity searches, intentionally subjected to extremes of heat and cold for the purpose of causing suffering ...\" </p> <p>The law suit claims the mistreatment was \"in plain violation\" of the US constitution, federal law and its international treaty obligations. </p> <p>The Britons say the highest levels of the US government are to blame for their torture: \"It was the result of deliberate and foreseeable action taken by defendant Rumsfeld and senior officers to flout or evade the US constitution ... law ... treaty obligations and long established norms of customary international law.\" </p> <p>In a December 2002 memo, Mr Rumsfeld authorised the \"use of mild, non-injurious physical contact, such as grabbing, poking in the chest with the finger and light pushing\". </p> <p>Also approved were stress positions, isolation for 30 days, deprivation of light and other stimuli, 20-hour interrogations, convincing detainees that death or severe pain was imminent, shaving the beards of Muslim men and using dogs. </p> <p>In one declassified US document, a lawyer advises \"the use of a wet towel to induce the misperception of suffocation would also be permissible\". </p> <p>In August, the Tipton three released a 115-page dossier detailing their alleged ill-treatment. The Red Cross said the allegations were so serious that, if true, they amounted to war crimes. </p> <p>Eventually one of the Tipton three confessed to meeting Osama bin Laden at an al-Qaida training camp. But British intelligence established that he was working in a Currys electrical store in the UK at the time. </p> <p>In a statement yesterday, the three said: \"We believe those who have been and still are responsible for these deliberate and unlawful actions must be held accountable. If they are not, this nightmare will happen again and again to others.\" </p> <p>The US government is expected to try to get the case thrown out or to argue that the actions of senior officials are immune from prosecution because the US was \"at war\" after the September 11 attacks.</p>",
  "<p>Electronic Arts announced last month it would be strengthening ties with Digital Bridges, a mobile games publisher responsible for distributing Java versions of EA brands such as Fifa and Tiger Woods. It was, perhaps, the technological equivalent of being \"made\" by the mafia - a symbolic confirmation that mobile phones have been accepted into the traditional games industry as an essential platform. And with the Christmas season approaching, there has been a larger influx than before of Java releases based around well-known console brands. </p> <p>The key example is Fifa 2005: Mobile International Edition. The latest Java version of the hit football series switches to an isometric display from a top-down view. This provides a better representation of the players and a more workable view of the pitch. The action is fast-paced, too, with one-touch passing moves and a nice power bar-based shooting system, although the sheer speed can be confusing as you struggle to identify the player you are controlling and then get him moving towards the ball. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Red Faction, from THQ Wireless, takes the Mars rebellion setting of the successful console first person shooter and uses it to create a visually impressive shooter viewed from the top down. The aim is to plough through each level, carrying out simple mission objectives, blasting enemies and picking up weapons. The sharp character design and rich scenic detail bring to mind classic Amiga shooters such as Chaos Engine, while the presence of left and right strafing almost makes up for the lack of eight-way directional control on most handsets. It is a well thought-out release. </p> <p>Gameloft, which is responsible for excellent mobile conversions of Prince of Persia and Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow has turned its skills to the popular Might and Magic action role-playing game series. </p> <p>You control a team of variously skilled warriors on a typical fantasy quest involving puzzle-solving, spell-casting and monster-bashing. It is a varied gameplay experience made all the more vibrant by the gorgeous isometric graphics and enormous maps. It is another landmark title from perhaps the leading mobile developer. Conversions of Prince of Persia 2 and Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory are due over the next few months. </p> <p>Another excellent console-to-mobile conversion is Colin McRae Rally 2005 from Digital Bridges. Featuring the usual selection of championship, single race and stages options, the game offers a decent miniature rally experience, down to vehicle damage, road surfaces and the sound of turbo pop as you grapple with the gears. The handling has progressed from earlier 3D-style mobile racers, offering a sensation of wheel slide as you hit corners. The handbrake is a little strict, though, and the stages are often a little too long for a mobile title, but this is a fine conversion that just a few months ago would have seemed impossible on a Java handset. </p> <p>There is even a simple two-player, time-trial mode offering competitive play. The next step is to get mobile and console talking so the two versions can share data. It would be great to be able to repair and upgrade cars while on the move and then download them back into the console version.

Although you can already log on to (for example) Orange's website and send a single text message, the new scheme allows you to send to multiple recipients and also sends messages beyond the standard short messages a phone will handle. Since it sets up an effective new account for you, you can also receive replies on your PC.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Federation of Small Business has highlighted a new area of concern for small businesses - the banks have admitted that cheques don't always clear within three days.</p> <p>According to the FSB, although funds appear in your account within three days once you've banked a cheque, this can be due to your bank taking it on trust and crediting your cash flow from its own funds, expecting immediate settlement of the cheque. In fact, settlement has, in some cases, taken months, and banks have admitted to the FSB that there is no guarantee that cheques won't be withdrawn later on.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Backup is something everyone should do, as long as it is done intelligently - this means preserving the right files (every version of every draft isn't important, your accounts are) and preferably offsite so if your office burns down your backups are still safe. This is why Datafort has launched PCFort, a system that allows you to back up your data over the internet on to their servers.</p> <p>This isn't a new idea - companies including NetStore have been in the market for years, but Datafort's advantage is that it costs only \u20ac2.99 per month per gigabyte backed up.</p> <p>Presumably others will adjust their pricing as a result of the launch. See <a href=\"http://www.datafort.co.uk\">www.datafort.co.uk</a> for details.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Recruitment agency Adecco has launched Adecco Plus, a scheme under which it hopes to make businesses aware of workplace diversity. It will focus on ageism (which now starts at 42 according to new research from Sanders and Sidney), sexism and discrimination against people with disabilities. Specifics within the initiative include diversity monitoring to ensure that places of employment actually welcome people from different backgrounds, an offsite registration process, fully trained staff and a regional team of business process managers to ensure compliance with diversity legislation and objectives.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Meanwhile, recruitment website Reed (<a href=\"http://www.reed.co.uk\">www.reed.co.uk</a>) has published research stating that one in 25 employees walks out of their job because the induction process is deeply flawed. The figure rises to one employee in 17 when the job is in the media or public sector, who therefore seem to be the chief culprits. Geographically, people in the north-east and Thames Valley were most likely to have walked out of a job because of the welcome they had, or rather didn't have, on arrival.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Proxim has launched a new WiFi access point aimed at small businesses called the ORiNOCO AP-700. Billed as offering enterprise-class functionality to the smaller business, it does this through extra security add-ins and extra speed. It is compliant with the IE 802.11i standard, which technologists will confirm is state of the art and more secure than its predecessors. Uniquely for the moment, Proxim has built-in rogue AP detection which should keep intruders out of the network. The product is aimed both at people wanting a network for their workplace and also at people wanting to offer WiFi to their customers.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Alertbox has released its product, also called the Alertbox, to small businesses and neighbourhoods alike. It's a small box that has your name and details put into it as well as those of neighbouring businesses (or neighbours) and then communicates with their Alertboxes wirelessly - so you can send a signal for help at the touch of a button, often undetected if there's an intruder in the area. There are no ongoing account charges, it runs off mains power and once it's set up it's done. It is currently being supplied through police authorities, housing associations and other bodies that can equip a variety of premises.<br>(<a href=\"http://www.alertbox.co.uk\">www.alertbox.co.uk</a>)</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> BT is collaborating with Microsoft to develop an overall office offering to take account not only of software but of the bandwidth a company will need in order to run it. Called BT Broadband Office Complete, it includes secure broadband access, web hosting, security, hosted exchange, applications, services, support and maintenance, all from a single source, and one bill (at \u00a356 per seat, per month). The move is in part a reaction to feedback from customers who would rather pay a single source for all of their IT rather than one place for their internet costs, another for their software and so on, as highlighted in this column last month.</p>",
  "<p>Talk to anyone who works from home and it won't be long before they impress upon you their profound gratitude at being able to bin the alarm clock and avoid those uncomfortably intimate crushes on the 8.15 to Waterloo.</p> <p>Work/life balance initiatives such as remote working and flexible hours have risen steadily, if more slowly than expected, over the last 10 years, thanks to a combination of technological advances and changing demographics, such as more women coming into the workplace.</p> <p>The purported benefits for employees are a reduction in stress, more time for family and a greater degree of control over their time. Employers see cost savings, less absenteeism and increased productivity as their reasons for being flexible-friendly. Small firms, especially, can benefit from reducing the cost of having workers present in a workplace.</p> <p>But it is the productivity factor that comes up time and time again when companies talk about flexible working, which raises the question: is this a way of extracting more from workers under the guise of touchy-feely altruism? Sometimes, says Ross Hendry of the public sector union Unison's Work Life Balance campaign.</p> <p>\"Occasionally the individual's experience of home working is negative. Managers will increase their workload to compensate for not being able to supervise them.\"</p> <p>Research by IT and business consultancy Skillfair suggests working from home isn't all bon-bons and cups of tea. More than half of those questioned in their survey into remote working said they worked longer away from the office.</p> <p>Other dissenting voices include the TUC. Earlier this year, general secretary Brendan Barber warned: \"Working outside the office should be an option that improves job quality for employees and brings people back into the workforce, not just a cheap option for employers.\"</p> <p>But on the whole, it seems more of us than ever want to go home to work. According to research by think-tank The Work Foundation, 47% of employees want flexibility.</p> <p>Among 18-24-year-olds, 80% said they would be more motivated at work if they had access to work/life balance schemes. The 2003 UK Graduate Careers survey showed that university leavers value flexibility more than pay when looking at prospective employers.</p> <p>Hendry says: \"Our research suggests the experience of remote working is neither wholly negative or positive for the employer and the employee. There are many good reasons why workers, despite feeling they are having more work dumped on them, still prefer to work at home, including a reduction in stress.\"</p> <p>In the wake of the dotcom boom, there are now many companies that use remote working exclusively. Alex Crockett runs Intrepid Developments, a Bristol-based internet and business systems consultancy providing IT solutions for the SME market. His developers all work from home, keeping in contact by means of instant messaging and video conferencing.</p> <p>The main benefit to the company is financial, says Crockett. \"We have little or no overheads in terms of office space. I can source talented staff from all over the UK, whereas if I was to bring them in-house I would only be able to find them from the locality.\"</p> <p>If these thoroughly modern work solutions are so great for everyone, why don't more of us enjoy them? A variety of reasons: inadequate IT, expenditure issues, even technophobe employees.</p> <p>Hendry says: \"Many employers think letting people work at home will save them money, but there are set-up costs. And, of course, some managers just aren't happy with not being able to supervise their staff all the time.\"</p> <p>Despite this, he says, flexible working will continue to grow. \"After one or two trailblazers in a workplace have done it and gone through all the teething problems, it becomes easier because it can be presented to colleagues and managers as doable. The more it is seen to work and the better and cheaper the technology becomes, the greater the numbers wanting to do it will be.\"</p> <p>One company with a long, fruitful experience of flexible working is Happy, which provides computer and online training. The company employs 36 staff at its offices near the City of London and was voted Family Friendly Employer of the Year 2003 by the NSPCC. It has had a flexible working policy in place for almost 10 years, but only formalised it seven years ago.</p> <p>Happy employees can work from home, choose flexible hours and take sabbaticals and dependency leave.</p> <p>The policies are so successful, says managing director Cathy Busani, that no one wants to leave. She says: \"We have a staff turnover under half the UK average, and when we are looking to recruit we don't need to advertise - we have more than 2,000 people on the job list waiting to hear of new jobs.\"</p> <p>Remote working is a popular option. Trainers work three or four days a week and one day at home. Admin staff can work remotely when they have special projects on and staff in the online department only come in two days a week.</p> <p>Busani says: \"The employer benefits, the worker benefits and the customers, who ultimately we are there for, benefit because they are dealt with by happy staff.\"</p> <p>The company provides loans for workers to buy PCs to use at home. Once they are set up, staff are closely monitored to ensure they are happy with their working environment. Twice-yearly appraisals are held, in which employees are asked if they are happy with their work/life balance.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the answer is usually \"yes\".</p>",
  "<p>Running a small or medium-sized business can be hugely demanding when you have so many different tasks to complete without the back up and support enjoyed by larger corporations.</p> <p>And if the phones are ringing all the time, you can spend valuable chunks of your day taking messages - and sometimes missing important calls - rather than actively seeking new business or dealing with existing customers.</p> <p>That's why some SMEs are now turning to organisations which are providing virtual office services. A good example is Media 4U, a Glasgow-based IT company with 35 staff, which was finding it extremely difficult to recruit a receptionist who understood their business and was struggling to manage and allocate incoming calls.</p> <p>So they have taken on Connect, a virtual PA organisation, to help them, as the company's depot manager, Robert Jones, explains. \"We were spending a lot of the working week answering phones and it was taking us away from our core business.\"</p> <p>Under the new arrangements, Media 4U's calls are handled and allocated to staff by an external experienced operator who forwards any urgent messages by email or text. \"The service we have now is very efficient. Customers are getting a nice professional voice at the end of the phone,\" Jones says.</p> <p>The operators of these virtual office services argue that they are able to give SMEs a big company image and point out that they are a lot more cost efficient than expanding the payroll. \"People like to think they are dealing with a larger, more successful business,\" says Lynne Ginnelly, sales manager for Connect.</p> <p>But how personal is the virtual PA service? \"Before we take any calls we would have to agree a script,\" she says. This deals with how the call is answered, and what should happen to any urgent messages. Like other virtual office services, Connect sends its customers a log of calls twice a day by email.</p> <p>Other companies in this sector such as All Day PA handle your business calls and take messages but also provide you with a useful online office facility which offers email, your own contacts, diary and to-do lists.</p> <p>As part of the standard set up, you agree how you would like your virtual office PA to greet customers when they ring the dedicated number. This involves deciding what should be said if you are not available. The options include the caller being told that you are \"with a customer\" or \"in a meeting\" - which is probably better than them getting your recorded voice message.</p> <p>The Guardian tested the service and we found messages were taken by your PA and forwarded via email in a few minutes.</p> <p>All Day PA's Danielle Freedman explains: \"The service is designed for all types of businesses. It could be for someone who is continually on the road or a large corporate organisation which wishes to have all its calls answered through our service.</p> <p>\"Customers will never know the receptionist is based somewhere else.\"</p> <p>Virtual office services are particularly valuable when you are growing as a business and don't want to spend too much on a traditional office infrastructure. \"It's a great costsaving solution,\" says Sanjay Dhir, managing director of Vivid Gifts, which imports and distributes gadgets for the retail trade. \"It gives me 24- hour access to my office. It gives my customers 24-hour access to my business.\"</p> <p>Dhir arranges for the virtual PAs to patch calls through to the relevant members of his team but he receives a full record of calls every day by text and email so he can check if any key customer calls have been missed.</p> <p>There are a wide choice of virtual office service providers to choose from to support SMEs and most of them have a complete list of their costs on their sites. Services are becoming more sophisticated too. Companies like Ten UK are offering company executives \"lifestyle management\" services, which means their virtual PAs will book holidays, arrange romantic dinners or even organise a session with a yoga teacher.</p> <p>And, for many stressed out SME directors, that might be a very good call indeed.</p>",
  "<p>Every reader who is a business owner or manager is likely to claim they offer their employees a good work/life balance. It would be crazy to claim otherwise; tantamount to admitting to a lousy HR policy if you're big enough to have such a policy, or just an admission of incompetence otherwise.</p> <p>But achieving a good work/life balance for your employees is actually more difficult than it might at first sound. Take Robert. Robert is fictional, but based on a real character. He's just been recruited fresh from college - he's full of energy and ideas which will benefit your organisation and his inexperience can also pay off because he has yet to acquire the patina of cynicism about whether a given idea will actually work. His idea of work/life balance is as follows:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> earn enough to buy a car and a flat, whatever hours it takes;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> mix with young colleagues and find a ready-made social life at his place of work.</p> <p>Take also John, also based on a real character. He is not a youngster, but he's not quite 40. He has a young family and is experienced; his energy is tempered by the years but his enthusiasm is still in place. His idea of work/life balance consists mostly of the following:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> earn enough to pay the mortgage and feed his family as well as running the car;</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> he's put on weight over the years and is aware that exercise wouldn't be a bad thing, so if there's a gym membership going, so much the better.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> friendly colleagues would be good and the occasional social event pleasant enough, but from choice he'd like to get off on time and see his family, which is where he enjoys spending his time.</p> <p>Astute readers will have guessed that both recruits are based on the same person at different stages of his life. The difficulty for owner/managers seeking to accommodate both varieties of employee and many in between as well as those with different aspirations is that servicing every conceivable variation on work/life balance is effectively impossible.</p> <p>This is why Tim Osborn Jones of Henley Management College queries the value of the whole notion of such balance.</p> <p>People will want different things and not just because of their ages, he says. \"My overriding view of the work/ life balance debate is as much as it's been apparently a headline issue for the past five years, the debate hasn't actually moved anywhere in particular with any degree of further clarity and is possibly beginning to move off the centre stage.\"</p> <p>Reasonable though this may appear, there is certainly an issue of some sort affecting people in some way. Recruitment consultancy Adecco commissioned some research in May, which pointed to managers and owners in particular as having a work-rich, life-poor balance.</p> <p>Twenty per cent of managers worked for 20% more time than they were paid for, equating to seven days a week. Four in 10 admitted missing family commitments due to work, and around 35% admitted to having little energy on weekday evenings due to work.</p> <p>Flexible working directives and the like have helped to an extent, although fewer than 5% believed these would ever really happen in their workplace - and anecdotal evidence suggests that unless an individual has the right mindset, flexible working isn't the panacea some people might believe. BT, a pioneer in this area, found after the first year of allowing remote working early in this century that a number of employees were coming back and asking to be put back into the office. Not only was the social element of office working important to them, but the idea of being unable to shut the door on work and have an entirely separate home existence fails to appeal to everyone.</p> <p>Osborn Jones agrees that the work/life balance remains an issue, but says it needs to be seen in the context of other issues. \"In the particular context that it was forming, that is to say a dialogue between employer and employee, work/life balance is not going to disappear but a number of issues of that sort jostle for attention, research, solutions and priority.\"</p> <p>And it is this dialogue between employer and employee that holds the key. It is noticeable that in the example employees quoted early on in this article, none of the work/life balance attributed to the employees involved much in the way of work. Part of this is due to the nature of the employment market; as the market moves increasingly in favour of the employee it becomes incumbent on the employer to become an \"employer of choice\", to use the current jargon.</p> <p>Meanwhile there are management techniques that can help in establishing some sort of balance for a business, even in the smaller organisations. Paul Elliot considers himself an \"entrepreneurs' coach\" (see below for his background) and has identified a number of areas in which decision-makers frequently do unhelpful things in achieving any goals or not being swamped.</p> <p>\"They're firefighting most of the time,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Phone calls are coming in, faxes, emails, all those kind of things.\" The reflex action is the courteous one - if someone has emailed you or calls, you reply immediately with no thought as to whether it's likely to be productive or whether technology could help. Figures from a company called High Efficiency Skills, which assists people with speed reading, suggest people spend two hours per day reading emails and that they then send unfocused responses.</p> <p>Elliot blocks out every hour in his diary, with some flexibility built in. \"Answering the phone is something people do reactively, and really for very little benefit,\" he claims.</p> <p>He prefers to dedicate an hour in the afternoon to dealing with correspondence, whether this be voice, mail or fax, and his voicemail message says so - call him and he won't answer the phone, but he will tell you when he'll call back.</p> <p>Another thing to do from the \"work\" side of work/life balance is to set some targets. So often (and it's a generalisation, but not a bad one) companies exist because someone wants to run a business rather than to achieve any real end. \"On the whole, when I do speeches for clients, part of the reason they've got themselves into difficulties is because they haven't set any meaningful goals to start with.\"</p> <p>It goes deeper, however. Life coach Rachel McGuinness (see below) points out that a lot of people get so wound up in their working practice that they effectively no longer have a life - school and college friends are long gone and have not been replaced outside the working environment. The phrase \"get a life\" is often used as an insult, but it contains an element of sound advice.</p> <p>And there are ways in which companies can help people to get a life, if they really feel they need a push and if the money is available. A number of firms on the medium side of SMEs include in their training budget some cash for education that's not job-related. So if an employee really wants to learn Spanish, or take up pottery, they go to their manager who pays whatever peanuts the local authority evening classes cost, and the employee goes away feeling motivated to deliver excellence in his or her workplace.</p> <p>Another gives out incentivised Red Letter Day vouchers, so if someone performs well enough (not solely in terms of sales) they get a day gliding, or learning to make sushi, or whatever else they may wish to do.</p> <p>There are plenty of approaches, and they're worth considering. As Osborn Jones points out, at a time of full employment (you can argue the figures if you wish, but the perception is that employment is higher than, say, 20 years ago) there is likely to be more competition among the employers for the best job candidates than among the candidates for the best jobs.</p> <p>Taking a flexible approach to how people assimilate a job into their lives is a powerful tool in attracting those candidates, within the parameters of getting the job done. And with some forethought and research it needn't cost much.</p> <p>Useful website: <a href=\"http://www.dti.gov.uk/work-lifebalance\">www.dti.gov.uk/work-lifebalance</a></p> <p><strong>Case study: Rachel McGuinness</strong></p> <p>Rachel McGuinness was in a very stressful job for several years and, like a lot of people, she wanted to get out. \"My body just told me that I really needed to sort myself out,\" she says.</p> <p>She decided to revamp her lifestyle starting with her health, so diet was the first item addressed. Then exercise, and then \"making sure you actually have a life outside of work\". From these precepts her idea for the Life Spa, her own business, evolved.</p> <p>She studied business while working and continued after leaving. There are traps to avoid, however: \"When you're starting a business it's a euphoric phase so it's essential to keep your work/life balance under review at that time,\" she says. \"I also make sure that during my own time I'm making time for my family, making time for me and making time for my personal development.\"</p> <p><strong>Case study: Isobel Rimmer</strong></p> <p>Isobel Rimmer is MD of recruitment company Masterclass, which has 20 employees spread across two sites. Unusually, half of these employees are working mothers who have to fit their employment around childcare.</p> <p>Rimmer herself has three children, one of whom has a disability. The decision to offer three-day weeks or four-day weeks to the returning mothers was based on their effectiveness as business people.</p> <p>Rimmer says: \"Would my preference be still to have people five days a week? Yes it would be. But the reality is that mothers want to come back to work but couldn't five days a week, and if you gave them the choice of five days or nothing, you'd get nothing.\" The payback is enormous in terms of loyalty and getting experienced people, rather than spending months bringing a recruit up to speed.</p> <p>\"And if you offer someone the flexibility so they only work Tuesday to Thursday, they make sure they're working very hard on those days - and they'll do what needs to be done because they want to.\"</p> <p><strong>Case study: Paul Elliot</strong></p> <p>Paul Elliot ran his own seminar business and found it to be all-consuming. \"I'd bought all the very expensive big leather diaries and found it still wasn't working,\" he says. \"I'd got my head stuck in it - we'd been successful to a certain point but then breaking through that ceiling wasn't going to happen in the manner in which we were conducting business.\"</p> <p>Many small businesses, he believes, reach the stage at which they turn over half a million or so and can pay themselves a good salary. But they'll never break through that barrier because of the way in which they go about setting goals and managing their time.</p> <p>He set up Practical Achievement to address this imbalance. \"What I teach people is that you've got to set your goals for business and life in tandem. That's an absolute must. For example, rather than look at your business and think 'OK, I've been this successful this year so I can take this amount of money out', turn it on its head and say how much you want your business to pay you.\"</p> <p><strong>Case study: Kate Fishenden</strong></p> <p>Kate Fishenden has a company involved in branding and her husband was one of the partners, but they became aware that work was taking over because he was coming home later and later. \"I was back early because of the school run, and another partner moved to Birmingham then the other one moved to France, so we started thinking, why have we got an office?\"</p> <p>Their answer was to scrap the office all together and start a sister business, LingoLAB, which handles more than just name and trademark checking. \"The creative side gave us a reason to meet up,\" she says.</p> <p>The company now meets at least once a fortnight, it uses places like the Institute of Directors as a meeting place. \"We have a registered address at our accountant's, we meet mostly at client premises.\"</p>",
  "<b>Daily Telegraph </b> <br>Editorial, October 27 <p>\"President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan is a bluff but cunning soldier-politician. His latest pronouncement on solving the Kashmir conflict has burnished his credentials in the west and caught the Indians off guard. In an address to local journalists on Monday night, the general abandoned Pakistan's insistence on a plebiscite to determine which of the two countries Kashmir should join, but rejected India's suggestion that the line of control (LoC) that bisects the state turn into a permanent border ... </p> <p>\"Any move to break the impasse over Kashmir between two nuclear-armed neighbours deserves serious consideration ... The problem is that diplomacy conducted through the media on such a sensitive issue is unlikely to yield dividends, at least as far as the people of Jammu and Kashmir are concerned.\" </p> <p><b>Times of India </b><br>Editorial, October 27 </p> <p>\"Gen Musharraf is an honourable man. But he is also a dictator who can speak his mind whenever he chooses. His latest proposal is for New Delhi and Islamabad to demilitarise various regions of Jammu and Kashmir on both sides of the LoC and change their status. They could be granted independence, brought under the joint control of both countries or the UN. In contrast, India is a mature democracy that does not allow the prime minister the luxury of floating such trial balloons. In a democracy, the state pronounces on important matters after talking to every stakeholder ... </p> <p>\"Gen Musharraf's grandiose proposal suggests handing over to the UN or the 'people' (read Pakistan-backed militants) parts of Kashmir that unquestionably belong to India. It does not require great insight to anticipate that India will not take Gen Musharraf's proposal seriously.\" </p> <p><b>Dawn </b><br>Editorial, Pakistan, October 27 </p> <p>\"Gen Musharraf has done the right thing by calling for a debate on Kashmir options. He has rightly said that the status quo offers no solution ... Having fed the public on a lot of propaganda for over 50 years, the [Pakistani] establishment has led the people to believe that Kashmir can be taken with the force of arms and that every Kashmiri wants the state to join Pakistan. </p> <p>\"Now a strong section of opinion in Pakistan - though a small one - knows that this approach will only harm us ... It is also time that the people of Kashmir on both sides of the LoC are treated as key stakeholders who should have a major say in the debate.\" </p> <p><b>Frontier Post</b><br> Editorial, Pakistan, October 27 </p> <p>\"The whole debate process will remain incomplete and may even prove futile if the Kashmiris are not involved in it now actively. It is their destiny that is to be decided. And it looks extremely odd that while others are discussing the ways of settling their destiny, they are no part of it. </p> <p>\"Arguably, if Indians cannot talk on their behalf, so can't Pakistan. They have to speak for themselves. It is, therefore, of utmost importance that both the countries should inspire a similar debate across the Kashmir divide and also facilitate the Kashmiri leaderships of the two sides to sit together and evolve a consensus option ... Any solution worked out bilaterally ... and then foisted on the people of the disputed state would not work.\" </p> <p><b>Hindustan Times </b><br>Editorial, India, October 27 </p> <p>\"It has been said there is nothing new under the sun. Neither is Gen Musharraf's idea of giving independence to [Kashmir]. Of course, he hasn't quite put it that way, but that indeed is the implication of his proposal ... </p> <p>\"Just how long an independent Kashmir [would] survive is anybody's guess. But considering that it has taken the entire might of the Indian army to keep it away from Pakistan in the past 57 years, our guess would be: several hours.\" </p> <p><b>Arab News </b><br>Editorial, Saudi Arabia, October 27 </p> <p>\"The world expects [India] to come up with a response that is just as positive.

This is no betrayal of Kashmir. Gen Musharraf has not said 'no' to a referendum, simply that it is unrealistic at this moment. Equally he has confirmed his determined opposition to Delhi's desired outcome - the present LoC becoming the official border between the two countries.\" </p> <p><b>Nation </b><br>Editorial, Pakistan, October 27 </p> <p>\"India's official stance is about Kashmir being its integral part, not the conversion of the LoC into a permanent border. For Pakistan to alter its stated position vis-a-vis the right of self-determination to Kashmiris would not, therefore, be wise. It must see how India has so far reciprocated our initiatives.

Patented technology was the main sticking point and the latest submission disengages the tie between Pobox technology, limiting the visible sender address to specific email domain names, and the disputed Microsoft technology to examine an embedded sender address. This frees developers from having to sign a Microsoft licence agreement said to be incompatible with open source licensing. <br> <a href=\"http://masl.to/?U11522E99\">http://masl.to/?U11522E99</a> </p> <p><strong> PC threat</strong><br> </p> <p>More than 80% of home computers carry an average of 93 hidden spyware and adware programs, while 30% have worms or viruses, according to an AOL survey of 329 home computers. The findings underline the threat to the IT industry from the internet. While companies can and often do lock down their networks, they can still be affected by home computers used to distribute huge quantities of spam and mount denial of service attacks. AOL says that two-thirds of the sample believed their systems were safe because they had anti-virus software, but they had not downloaded the latest updates, and 90% had no idea what spyware was. <br> <a href=\"http://masl.to/?F22562E99\">http://masl.to/?F22562E99</a> </p> <p><strong> Network defences</strong><br> </p> <p> The problem of worms and other viruses being introduced by mobile workers attaching to the corporate network is being addressed by Check Point.

It helps us be autonomous. </p> <p><strong> Do you see 30Hertz releasing a download-only version of your albums? </strong><br> There's a good chance of that, when I feel a need to document a piece of music and make it available, without incurring pressing costs. However, I'm sure a corporation will somehow control access to uploads as well as downloads and apply charges similar to those incurred when pressing CDs. It's the nature of the (capitalist) beast.

The people running the music industry were culturally redundant two decades ago. I found the disingenuous presentation of Napster repugnant. Unfortunately, due to the lack of informed people in the media, the battle was presented as a teenagers versus grown-ups battle. The serious ethical arguments were barely touched on. I have come across \"big kids\" in their 40s wearing T-shirts demanding fair wages for slave workers, naively championing the cause of things such as Napster, while being unaware of the implications of their actions - never mind the contradictions of attitude. </p> <p><strong> I hear you are getting into downloading music? </strong> <br>Just emusic (<a href=\"http://www.emusic.com\">www.emusic.com</a>) at the moment.

  "Julian Borger's dispatch contained gaps that could mislead readers (Guardian profile, October 22). He describes Toby Moffett's opposition to the Nader/ Camejo candidacy without describing him as a long-time lobbyist for Monsanto and, presently, a partner in the Republican Washington corporate lobbying firm, the Livingston Group. <p>Enormous signature- gathering barriers, placed in law in many states by the two major parties to block competition from smaller parties, often demand paid signature-gathering efforts. Some of these people, to earn more money, pad the petitions - which we try to catch, while collecting more than the required number of signatures. As if such obstructions are not enough, the Democratic party's political bigotry has led to many phoney law suits being launched by corporate law firms to deny voters the opportunity to choose the Nader/Camejo ticket by removing us from the ballot.

  "St John Armitage, who has died aged 80, was one of Britain's leading Arabists. The second half of his career was entirely in British embassies, but he was far too eccentric to be a conventional diplomat. Lean and gaunt-faced, he was blessed with unremitting energy and an infallible memory. He never stopped moving, never stopped talking. He knew everyone in Arabia and Iraq and had their telephone numbers and their family particulars in his head or his pocket-book. <p>Born in Yorkshire - and proud of it - he went to Bradford Grammar School and Christ's Hospital, Lincoln, and then to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1942. He read oriental studies for a year before joining the army, which sent him, with unusual sagacity, to the Middle East. After a spell with Glubb Pasha's Arab Legion, he decided to remain a soldier at the end of the war and was sent with a training mission to the new Saudi Arabian army at Taif, a hill station above Mecca. Some of the cadets he taught there became generals, ambassadors and ministers, and were his friends for life. </p> <p>In 1949, he left the army with the rank of major and spent a couple of years with the desert locust control, following in the footsteps of his friend Wilfrid Thesiger. From 1952 to 1959 he commanded the Salala Field Force in the service of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman at a remote outpost on the shores of the Arabian Sea. He then worked for two years with oil companies in Libya. </p> <p>In 1963, he joined the diplomatic service as first secretary at the embassy in Baghdad and soon built up a wide range of contacts. When the Iraqis broke off relations over the Big Lie (that the British had collaborated with Israel in her 1967 war with the Arabs), he acted as a travelling scout for the caravan that evacuated the British community from Baghdad into Iran. For his service in that operation he was appointed OBE. </p> <p>After a short spell at the embassy in Beirut, he was transferred to Jedda. There he spent six years, travelling widely and remembering everything. His final post was counsellor and consul general at Dubai where his energy and influence won for Britain a large share in the United Arab Emirate's blossoming economy. </p> <p>After retirement in 1978, he worked as consultant for commercial and industrial firms. But with his old-fashioned patriotism he would never advise a foreign company if a British rival was in the bidding. From his home in Somerset and the Travellers Club in London he travelled constantly, moving easily into modern communications technology. Wherever you went in the world he would track you down, lobbying, inviting, marshalling protests and projects. Every lunch or dinner with him was interrupted by a flow of messages. His telephone bills must have been enormous. </p> <p>He never forgot a name, date or place. His Arab friends were delighted when he remembered which son was an engineer and which daughter had had measles. He and I were friends for 50 years and he was always able to remind me who I had lunched with two decades earlier. It used to rile me that when I travelled in Arabia as British ambassador, people I was meeting for the first time would ask me if I knew an Englishman called Armitage. </p> <p>His Arabic was workmanlike rather than scholarly, but he built up a splendid library and on the history of Arabia he was truly learned, especially on TE Lawrence and St John Philby. He was always helpful in the organisation of exhibitions and conferences and always in demand as an authority and an adviser. A pity he was one of the experts not consulted by Tony Blair over Iraq. </p> <p>If he had been called in, he would have spoken his mind. For he could at times be undiplomatically forthright. Nor did he easily tolerate those who fell short of his own standards. But despite the occasional asperity he was a deeply kind man, generous, honourable, endearing. </p> <p>On his retirement from the Foreign Office, he was promoted CBE and on his 80th birthday the Saudi Ambassador gave a dinner party and presented him, on instructions from King Fahd, with the Order of King Abdulaziz, an honour seldom given to non-Saudis. He was married in 1976 to Jennifer Bruford, daughter of a professor at Edinburgh. Their long and happy marriage produced a son and a daughter. All three survive him. So will the love and esteem of his myriad friends. So will our memory of a precious and marvellously quirky man. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Henry St John Basil Armitage, soldier and diplomat, born May 5 1924; died October 19 2004</p>",
  "<p>In the summer of 2002, Steven McDonald, the bass player with American punk-pop band Redd Kross, had an idea. Listening to White Stripes - the minimalist Detroit duo who produce their stripped-down garage sound with just a guitar and drums - he wondered what it would sound like with a bass track. So he downloaded a White Stripes tune and tried it out. He liked it so much that he did their whole album, eventually uploading the new bass-laden tracks to his website, complete with a Photoshopped cover featuring himself as third band member. </p> <p>What McDonald did was illegal under copyright law. Although he called it performance art, many others call it plain old theft. Luckily for him, the Stripes' Jack White gave him the thumbs up backstage at a concert one night. Unfortunately for the rest of us, becoming a virtual third member of our favourite band remains a distant dream. </p> <p>But perhaps it is not as far away as it seems. On November 1, a group of new copyright licences will be released in the UK, arriving from the US under the umbrella of Creative Commons (CC). The project is the brainchild of Stanford University's law professor Lawrence Lessig, and the licences allow artists to move away from traditional copyright's \"all rights reserved\" towards a more digital age-friendly \"some rights reserved\". </p> <p>The different types of licence allow artists to choose which rights they wish to maintain. They could keep the right to exploit works for commercial gain, to veto derivative works or ask to be credited each time their work is reproduced. In turn, those encountering CC licensed works on the internet know immediately how the original artist feels about the use of that work without having to ring lawyers. </p> <p>The licences, available free from creativecommons.org, break down into three parts. A document explains clearly which rights the licence controls. The second \"lawyer-readable\" document ensures the licence's admission to the courtroom, fitting the new rights in with legal mechanisms particular to where the artist lives - CC is being ported to 60 jurisdictions around the world. </p> <p>The third part of the licence is machine-readable code that allows search engines, such as the one hosted at <a href=\"http://www.creativecommons.org\">creativecommons.org</a>, to find content based on the type of licence under which it is released. </p> <p>This search facility is CC's greatest strength. Although Creative Commons does not keep a record of everything licensed under CC, it does require that online licensed content links back to its website. The search facility then finds content according to what the searcher wants to do. So if you need a photograph of Yul Brynner for a non-commercial class presentation or a commercial magazine article, not only will you find it but you will also know whether you are allowed to use it. </p> <p>Obviously, for CC to take off, it needs to be endorsed by a wide range of content producers. Next month's issue of Wired, the American technology magazine, includes a CD of exclusive tracks from David Byrne, Chuck D, The Beastie Boys and others, all released on CC licences. All but three of the 16 tracks allow for non-commercial and commercial (excluding advertising) copying and sampling. </p> <p>So will Robbie Williams, who announced last year that he thought music piracy was \"great\", release his next album with a CC licence? Probably not. Lessig says many established artists are unlikely to routinely adopt CC until they see benefits, which will be demonstrated by more marginal artists breaking new markets under CC and the resulting collaborative projects gaining critical acclaim. </p> <p>One area where licences are likely to grow rapidly is with the written word. Already, net-aware writers have released their works for download under American CC rules. For out-of-print works, CC is a watertight legal mechanism that plugs gaps in demand without an expensive new print run - as the technology publisher O'Reilly demonstrated, by offering more than 150 such works for free download. </p> <p>Here, Creative Commons has serious backers. To encourage the circulation of its work, the thinktank Demos has been releasing reports under a CC-influenced open access licence. But the biggest backer is the BBC. The Creative Archive - which would see chunks of the broadcaster's archive posted for free download and sampling - was enabled by the approach to copyright of the Creative Commons team. </p> <p>In the battle against copyright infringement that the British music industry recently joined, Creative Commons will \"wage peace\", Lessig hopes, with an incoming generation of media users accustomed to downloading and remixing content from the net. </p> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.reddkross.com\">www.reddkross.com </a><a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/license/\">http://creativecommons.org/license/ </a></p>",

  "Three foreign election workers were kidnapped at gunpoint today in Afghanistan's capital Kabul, including a woman believed to be from Northern Ireland. <p>The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, confirmed that one of those taken from a clearly-marked UN vehicle had dual British and Irish nationality. Mr Straw said: \"We are in touch with the family.\" </p> <p>Officials have not named her but locals in Northern Ireland identified her as Annetta Flanigan from Richhill, a village between Portadown and Armagh city, in Co Armagh. It was thought that her husband was also in Kabul. </p> <p>Relatives were unavailable for comment but one neighbour said: \"Annetta was well known for her work with the UN. She would come back here every now and again on holidays.\"</p> <p>Another hostage was a Filipino, the government of the Philippines confirmed. A third was believed to be from the Balkans. </p> <p>Those taken were working for a joint UN-Afghan body which has been overseeing the October 9 elections, which are close to being concluded. </p> <p>The motive for the abduction was unclear. Taliban rebels have in the past kidnapped foreigners - although not in the capital. </p> <p>The US embassy issued a warning earlier this month that kidnappings might be attempted around the presidential vote. </p> <p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, said on Monday that the presidential elections in Afghanistan had dealt a \"huge blow\" to terrorists. </p> <p>Abdul Hadi Qasemi, an Afghan working for UN security, said the three were stopped and abducted by five gunmen on a road slightly away from the capital's busy streets. </p> <p>An Afghan government official said the driver of the UN vehicle, who was left behind, told investigators that a black four-wheel-drive vehicle with tinted windows pulled in sharply in front of his car. </p> <p>Several uniformed men got out and accused the driver of cutting them off at the previous corner, the official said on condition of anonymity. They then forced the foreigners into their car, which turned around and drove off. The driver was beaten, he said. </p> <p>This afternoon, UN security staff ringed the white vehicle, found near the office of the joint UN-Afghan electoral team. The car had its doors locked and there was no sign of any struggle. </p> <p>UN spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva confirmed the abductions but declined to identify the victims. </p> <p>A statement from the Philippine department of foreign affairs identified the abducted Filipino as Angelito Nayan, a foreign service officer seconded to the UN electoral effort. </p> <p>\"The department strongly condemns such acts as pointless hindrances to the rebuilding of the Afghan nation, which has just successfully completed its first democratic election,\" the statement said.</p> <p>Police said the kidnappers headed in the direction of Paghman, a district in the west of Kabul province that is considered rife with banditry. </p> <p>Officers manning checkpoints around the city and in neighbouring districts including Paghman were alerted to check the identity of any foreigners passing their posts, officials said. </p> <p>Reporters also saw American troops checking vehicles on the main road out of the west of the city tonight. </p> <p>In Kabul, Nato helicopter gunships circled overhead, as Norwegian armoured vehicles briefly sealed off a street in the city's upmarket Wazir Akbar Khan neighbourhood. Police said Nato troops searched about a dozen houses before pulling out. </p> <p>Afghanistan remains a largely lawless country in the grip of warlord militias, despite the presence of thousands of American troops and other foreign soldiers under Nato command. </p> <p>About 1,000 people have died in political violence so far this year, including more than 30 American soldiers. Still, it has not seen kidnappings or suicide attacks of the intensity of those in Iraq. </p> <p>A string of bombings and shootings blamed on militants killed at least a dozen election workers in the run-up to the presidential vote. </p> <p>Election day passed relatively peacefully, but optimism that the militants were a fading force was dampened Saturday when a suicide attacker armed with grenades killed an American woman and an Afghan teenager and injured three Nato soldiers in a Kabul shopping street. </p> <p>Several foreign construction workers have been kidnapped along the Kabul-Kandahar highway, which is being rebuilt with mainly US funds. </p> <p>The last foreigner to be kidnapped in Afghanistan was a Turkish engineer seized in March by suspected Taliban militants. He was freed unharmed in June, though a second Turk and an Afghan policeman were killed during the abduction. </p> <p>Others abducted earlier, including Turks and Indians, were later released unharmed. </p> <p>The US-backed interim leader, Hamid Karzai, could be proclaimed the winner of the presidential election by this weekend, as an investigation of alleged fraud in the vote winds down with no indication it could overturn his majority. </p> <p>An estimated 8.2m ballots were cast in the vote, for which there was a turnout of about 70%. </p> <p>Earlier this week, talking about the threat posed by Islamist terrorists around the globe, Mr Blair told his monthly press conference at Downing Street: \"This can't be defeated by security alone ... The biggest blow that has been dealt these terrorists in the last few months is the Afghan elections. </p> <p>\"That was a country used as a training ground for terrorists, and now it will have a democratically-elected president and later a democratically-elected parliament. That is a huge blow to them.\"</p>",
  "<p>In a work-driven world, it's hard to admit that an activity's purpose is purely fun. But the West Country - which gave us Glastonbury, New Age travellers and scrumpy - is surely a place where you can own up to simply doing something for a laugh?</p> <p>And yet here I am listening as John Grainger, from the Castle Combe Skid Pan track, tries to claim with a straight face that what I'm doing - accelerating a BMW through out-of-control, enormous spins, and whacking into the cones just because I can - is all about road safety. </p> <p>When we arrive, George, his assistant, is \"testing\" the slippiness of the surface (oiled and hosed to make cars do screaming 360s) by hurtling backwards in a Rover round a figure of 8 track. \"Now,\" says John, \"I want you to go out there and spin.\" Not, you understand, because it's a total hoot and every boy racers' dream; oh no. This is to be prepared for what could happen on an icy day. </p> <p>To underpin it, John occasionally shares his dark, haunted visions. \"A little old lady on the pavement. You're skidding towards her. But you have to ignore her and focus on the line of safety. Do you swing out? No. Because there's a 40-foot artic truck. Little old lady or the artic? That's a decision you have to make.\"</p> <p>There's no time to dwell on ethics, because we're straight on to the 4x4s. In a Land Rover Discovery, we head around the corner to an artificial hill: near-vertical slopes, rocky surfaces and some enormous toxic-looking puddles. Course objective: to learn how to control and manage the capabilities of the 4WD. Our objective: drive down mad steep hills and land with a splash. </p> <p>\"We're always looking for the safest way,\" cautions John. \"You could be on safari miles off the beaten track in 30 grand's worth of vehicle, fall down a ravine and no one's ever going to find you.\" Until that moment, we can only urge John to drive us up and over that really impossible drop one more time. </p> <p>The third activity here is karting, which is a blast, and makes no pretence at teaching you anything. We have a quick few laps. Well, they feel quick to me, though apparently a local kid can do the whole circuit in 23 seconds, approximately the time it takes me to get my fingers in the right bit of the gloves.</p> <p>And yet all this motoring joy, revelation of fun though it has been, is a mere sideshow compared to the main event next door: learning to drive a racing car on the Castle Combe circuit.</p> <p>In the reception room, about a dozen of us wannabe-Schumachers are shuffling in our seats through a mildly excruciating intro from the warm-up man. Then it's over to some quick fire instruction. The main thing you need to know, according to Alan Cooper, senior racing instructor, is the Racing Line. Follow the Racing Line, and you won't go far wrong. It's all about turning at the right moment - demonstrated on an old wall chart behind him and helpfully plotted out on the course with a selection of coloured cones. </p> <p>An instructor takes each student for a few laps round in a Ford Focus, in which I fail miserably to get my racing line in order, before transferring us - alone - to an actual racing car: a Formula Ford 1600. These don't have a speedometer, but we're assured that even those of us who can't quite get to grips with the unusual gearbox are doing a good 100mph. The trouble is, without pedestrians to swerve around, you don't really get a sense of how fast you're going. Perhaps I didn't push the accelerator enough - I'm relieved to emerge unscathed but confess to not having felt the promised adrenaline rush. </p> <p>But a better, faster driver than me is Peter O'Keefe, 39, from Cardiff, here today as a belated Christmas present, having done a similar course at Brands Hatch. \"It was a lot busier there. This is great: a quicker circuit, the cars are quicker, there's a better atmosphere. For some people it can be a little intimidating but there's none of that here - this is really good fun.\"</p> <p>In truth, I'd already discovered a new vehicle in Castle Combe that had stolen my heart: the golf buggy. A couple of minutes drive away is the Manor House Hotel, a classic country retreat in 365 acres of beautiful parkland, and endowed with a magnificent, championship standard golf course. The course is a long, undulating tour through woods and rivers. I loved it, but as a beginner was clearly out of my depth, despite an hour or so on the practice range. Consolingly, I wasn't the only one: in the river before the eighth green, the balls were stacking up like frogspawn. </p> <p>With the leaves turning red and gold around the fairways, it felt a perfect autumnal activity - topped off by returning to the Manor House where a log fire was crackling alluringly in the reception. It's the sort of welcoming country house where you can just sink into the sofas with a glass or two of something after an excellent dinner and not really want to stir, before trying to hazily discover which bit of the wood-panelled walls is actually the door. </p> <p>Castle Combe village is a pristine, ad-free time warp, delighting the Japanese tourists snapping away at the stone cottages. One row of these 18th century houses forms a wing of the hotel, undergoing a luxurious refit for next summer. Even now, had the visitors peeked through the windows they might have been surprised to find some very plush and modern bathrooms and fittings in among the four posters and wooden floorboards.

  "<p>A judge today wiped out a couple's debt of \u00a3384,000 which had spiralled out of control from an original loan of \u00a35,750 due to \"extortionate\" interest rates. </p> <p>Tony and Michelle Meadows, from Southport, Merseyside, faced losing their home after they were taken to court by London North Securities for failing to keep up with repayments on their loan, which had an APR of 34.9%. </p> <p>The ruling by Judge Nigel Howarth at Liverpool county court is expected to have far-reaching implications for consumers and lenders alike. </p> <p>He said: \"The claim must be dismissed,\" and added that the couple were not indebted to the claimant.</p> <p>The couple, who have two children, took out the loan in 1989. Mr Meadows, 45, a car windscreen salesman, claimed he had taken out the loan, designed for people with poor credit ratings, to install central heating and convert a bathroom into a third bedroom. The small print of the loan agreement revealed that the couple would be charged a \"compounded\" interest rate if they ever fell into arrears. </p> <p>Essentially this meant that the money lenders were charging 34.9% interest on the arrears as well as on the repayments, which soon resulted in the debt growing to an enormous amount. </p> <p>Judge Howarth said: \"Where the rate concerned is as high as 34.9% it seems to me that the combination of factors is so potentially exorbitant that it is grossly so and does grossly contravene the ordinary principles of fair dealing.\" He added: \"This is one of the few credit bargains which is extortionate.\" </p> <p>When the couple failed to keep up with repayments, their debt soared and London North Securities attempted to take possession of the couple's \u00a3200,000 family home to pay off the loan. </p> <p>Speaking outside court, Mr Meadows said the couple were \"absolutely delighted,\" and that he felt as though \"a ton of weight has been lifted off me\". </p> <p>\"It wasn't a wanton spending spree we went on back then, it was just something we had to do at the time. I would advise people thinking of taking a loan to read the small print very carefully.\" Mrs Meadows added: \"I can't take it in at the moment. I'm very happy.\" </p> <p>The couple's barrister, Paul Brant, said the decision would be welcome news to other people in serious debt. </p> <p>He said: \"This is a lifeline for borrowers who feel there is no hope. The consumer protection legislation in this country is working much more effectively after this decision.\" The judge granted the claimants leave to appeal the decision. </p> <p>The couple deny the loan was to pay off mortgage arrears of \u00a32,400, which the family built up after Mr Meadows left his career working for a jewellers to become a salesman for a golf company. </p> <p>Paul Brant, representing the Meadows, said the couple had only wanted a loan of \u00a32,000 to pay for home improvements but the lenders insisted they borrow more money to pay off their mortgage arrears. </p> <p>The court heard the couple ended up with a loan for \u00a35,750 to pay for \u00a32,000 home improvements, around \u00a33,000 to pay off their mortgage and \u00a3750 for an insurance policy they did not want. </p> <p>Before the today's judgment, Mr and Mrs Meadows described their situation as \"agonising\" and said they were at \"risk of losing everything\". </p>",
  "An ailing Yasser Arafat is expected to be moved from his West Bank compound to an overseas hospital - possibly in Paris or Jordan - later today, according to Palestinian officials. <p>\"It is most likely President Arafat will be transferred abroad for treatment. And it is very likely he will transferred to a hospital in Paris,\" said an official cited by Reuters. </p> <p>Another report said Mr Arafat was expected to be moved to the Jordanian capital, Amman. However, Palestinian cabinet minister Saeb Erekat said no decision had been made on where Mr Arafat will be taken for further treatment.</p> <p>The Palestinian leader has spent most of the day sleeping and has had difficulty standing and eating, according to aides. Doctors have conducted a battery of tests, but have declined to say what he is suffering from. One unconfirmed report suggested he may have a blood disorder.</p> <p>The seriousness of his condition was underlined by the arrival today of his wife, Suha, in the West Bank. She lives in Paris and has not seen her husband since 2001.</p> <p>If Mr Arafat is moved, it would be the first time he left his Ramallah headquarters since he was confined there by Israel in 2002. The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, has agreed to permit Mr Arafat to be flown abroad for medical treatment - though it is unclear whether the Palestinian leader would be allowed to return to the West Bank afterwards.</p> <p>Palestinian officials have been trying to play down his health problems, saying he performed prayers before dawn today and ate a light breakfast of cornflakes and milk. </p> <p>A friend of Mr Arafat, Monib al-Masri, told the Agence France Presse news agency that the Palestinian president wanted to tell the world there was no need to worry about his health. \"He prayed and is fully awake,\" Mr al-Masri added.</p> <p>However, another source said Mr Arafat spent most of the day sleeping. When he awoke, he was moved into a wheelchair because he was very weak and could not stand up, the associate told the Associated Press. </p> <p>He said Mr Arafat has been unable to hold down food, and also suffers from diarrhoea. At times, the veteran politician appeared confused, not recognising some of his visitors.</p> <p>The Palestinian president's persistent two-week illness took a sudden turn for the worse last night, when he vomited after eating soup and then collapsed unconscious for about 10 minutes, a bodyguard said. </p> <p>One official said Mr Arafat has created a special committee consisting of Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qureia, his predecessor Mahmoud Abbas, and Salim Zaanoun - the head of the Palestinian National Council - to run the PLO and the Palestinian Authority while he is ill. But Mr Arafat's spokesman denied he had set up any such committee.</p> <p>In Israel, defence officials were meeting today to discuss the consequences of Mr Arafat's possible death. Israel has prepared contingency plans, including how to deal with possible riots and prevent Palestinian attempts to bury their president in Jerusalem. </p> <p>The Israeli daily Haaretz reported today that Israel had marked a possible burial site for Mr Arafat in the Jerusalem suburb of Abu Dis in the West Bank, and has taken the location of the plot into consideration in planning the route of its West Bank separation barrier. </p> <p>Mr Sharon was meeting his defence minister, Shaul Mofaz. The country's foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, said a Palestinian Authority without Mr Arafat could become a partner for peace. </p> <p>\"We always said we would be willing to talk to a Palestinian leadership that would be willing once and for all to bring an end to the bloodshed,\" Mr Shalom told Israel Radio. </p> <p>Meanwhile, White House spokesman Scott McClellan, travelling in Michigan with US President George Bush, said US officials were monitoring the situation. </p> <p>Reports of Mr Arafat's illness have varied widely over the past two weeks. Palestinian officials said he had the flu, while Israeli officials speculated he might have stomach cancer. Two of his doctors said yesterday that a blood test and a biopsy of tissue from his digestive tract showed no evidence of that. </p> <p>On Tuesday, a hospital official said the Palestinian president was suffering from a large gallstone. The condition was extremely painful but not life-threatening and easily treated, the official said. Israeli officials also speculated that Mr Arafat had suffered a stroke. He has shown symptoms of Parkinson's Disease since the late 1990s. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's health crisis has highlighted how unprepared the Palestinians are for their leader's death, making a chaotic transition period all but inevitable. He has refused to groom a successor, fearing an impatient protege could turn on him. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Israeli troops shot and killed an eight-year-old Palestinian girl who was on her way to school in a Gaza Strip refugee camp, Palestinian witnesses said. </p> <p>Rania Iyad Aram of the Khan Younis camp was killed by random machine gun fire an army outpost near the neighboring Jewish settlement of Ganei Tal, witnesses said.</p>",
  "The home secretary, David Blunkett, yesterday scrapped his plan to combine the proposed compulsory national identity card with passports and driving licences in response to MPs' criticism that the scheme was poorly thought through. <p>Instead he announced a package of \"refinements\" that include the introduction of a stand-alone ID card to be issued alongside passports and driving licences but which will be valid for travel throughout Europe. </p> <p>The decision immediately sparked confusion over the eventual cost to the public of the national identity card with the Home Office insisting that two separate cards would, on current estimates, be no more expensive than the \u00a377 a head cost of a combined passport/ identity card. </p> <p>The rest of the package announced by Mr Blunkett yesterday included plans for a new Whitehall executive agency to run the identity card scheme, a more secure online verification system to guard against fraud, and a decision to drop government plans to set up a rival \"citizens' information project\" population database. </p> <p>At the same time the Home Office published the results of its latest consultation exercise, conducted in June, which showed that most public responses it had received opposed a compulsory scheme. The department's more representative polling data however shows continuing support for the scheme but a strong reluctance to pay for the cards. </p> <p>The results of focus group research reported that most people \"assumed that the scheme would be government-funded, and strongly opposed paying for the cards themselves. Details about the changes to passport costs caused much surprise, as few were aware of the move to biometrics [new electronic security features including fingerprints and eyescans], and the rise to \u00a373 was thought to be very significant\". </p> <p>Polling among black and other minority ethnic groups revealed majority support for identity cards but also strong concerns that they would be asked to produce the card more often than white people. </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said the decision to drop the plan for a combined passport/ identity card was based on polling data showing that 58% wanted the identity card issued as a separate document. </p> <p>A Home Office estimate published last November said a combined passport/identity card with biometric features would cost \u00a377, and a plain 10-year identity card a further \u00a335. But a spokesman insisted yesterday that the cost to the public of producing a separate biometric ID card and a biometric passport would, on current estimates, be no more than the \u00a377 figure as each individual would only have to provide their details once for both cards. </p> <p>The government's response to the critical report from the Commons home affairs select committee on ID cards also admits that the government has yet to build into its estimates the costs of tens of thousands of card \"scanners\" and \"readers\" that will be needed to operate the scheme. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett said he had made the changes in response to the consultations to ensure the scheme was \"as effective and efficient as possible\". He said that he would now bring forward legislation to introduce a compulsory, national ID card scheme. </p> <p>John Denham, the Labour chairman of the select committee, said that while further work needed to be done on the costings, the government's response made it much more likely that it would succeed. </p> <p>\"Over the coming months, parliament will want to scrutinise carefully the proposed statutory aims of the scheme and the safeguards against the misuse of the system. If we can get those right, the ID card scheme can be placed on a sound legal footing.\" </p> <p>But Mark Oaten of the Liberal Democrats said the cost of the scheme appeared to escalate with each announcement and said that the public would have no choice when they renewed their passports but to spend \u00a335 on a stand-alone ID card on top of the \u00a373 charge for the passport. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The botched set-up of the Criminal Records Bureau will cost \u00a3395m over 10 years - \u00a3150m more than originally planned, the House of Commons public accounts committee said yesterday. The CRB was designed to protect children and vulnerable adults by giving employers improved access to criminal records. It was launched seven months late in March 2002 and because of complex computer problems, 300,000 applications built up within seven months.</p>",
  "A teenager who was labelled a danger to young girls after he smothered a 10-year-old ballet dancer to death at a Christmas party was jailed for life today. <p>Paul Smith, 18, stripped Rosie May Storrie half-naked and pushed her face down on to a bed while her parents were downstairs with friends at the house party in Normanton, Leicestershire.</p> <p>The apprentice electrician was found guilty of murder by the jury at Nottingham Crown Court following more than nine hours of deliberations. </p> <p>The high court judge, Mr Justice Astill, said there was a sexual motive for the attack in December last year and ordered Smith, of Sedgebrook, Lincolnshire, to serve at least 14 years in jail.</p> <p>Outside court, Rosie May's father, Graham, said that he and his wife Mary were \"overwhelmed\" after the trial. \"We were on the edge of our seats, just praying for the right result and thankfully we got that.\" </p> <p>The Smith family solicitor, David Watts, read a statement outside court on behalf of Paul's parents and said the family was now in discussions with the teenager over a possible appeal. </p> <p>The statement read: \"We are deeply upset and shocked by this verdict. We remain convinced that Paul played no part in Rosie May's death and we will continue the fight to clear his name.\" </p> <p>The court heard that Smith, who suffered from Asperger's Syndrome, had a history of violence against young girls, including the abduction of a 16-year-old at gunpoint less than two years before his attack on Rosie May. </p> <p>The teenage victim was tied up and gagged before being marched by Smith to the garage, where he bundled her into the boot of his father's car. </p> <p>Sentencing him, the judge told him: \"I do not know if this disturbing part of your personality arises from the condition from which you undoubtedly suffer but I am sure that you are, and have been for some time now, a considerable danger to young girls. </p> <p>\"You made a determined attack upon this young child long enough and forceful enough to overcome the considerable struggle which she put up to survive, to prevent you from suffocating her. </p> <p>\"I have no doubt that your reason was sexual. Once you had overcome her, you stripped her clothing from her and it is reasonable on all the evidence I have heard to assume that it was the shouts of your family wondering where you were that stopped you going further.\"</p> <p>Smith stared straight ahead as the unanimous verdict of guilty to murder was delivered at the end of a two-week trial. </p> <p>The court heard Smith attended the party at the five-bedroomed house owned by his uncle and aunt, Ian and Sharon Smith, on December 28 last year. He arrived with his mother, father and brother Neil, and spent much of the evening downstairs.</p> <p>Later, he was seen on the landing with the 10-year-old, chasing her after she grabbed a can of Guinness from his hand. Within minutes, they had both disappeared and it was not until Smith was leaving the party that the little girl was discovered face-down on a bed. </p> <p>Mr Justice Astill, who also disqualified the teenager from working with children for life, said: \"The principal aggravating features of this offence are that you killed a young child and your reason was so that you could sexually assault her. </p> <p>\"I am satisfied on all the evidence that this was not an impulsive attack. Your comments about feeling sexual at an earlier time in the evening when she was attracting attention demonstrated that your feelings built up during the course of that evening. </p> <p>\"I cannot give you the benefit of good character because of your previous attacks on young girls but I do take into account your disability from which you suffer.\" </p> <p>Detective Superintendent Bob Small, of Leicestershire Police, said: \"This has been an extremely distressing case and I would like to express my condolences to Rosie's family. I know nothing can bring back their little girl but I hope that today's verdict will help them to move forward, knowing that the person responsible has now been brought to justice.\"</p> <p>The National Autistic Society (NAS) issued a statement today saying there was \"no established link\" between Asperger syndrome - which is an autistic spectrum disorder - and crime.</p> <p>Stuart Notholt, director of policy and public affairs at the society, said: \"There is no evidence to suggest that people with Asperger syndrome are more likely to break the law than anyone in the general population. </p> <p>\"There is, however, concern that people with Asperger syndrome may themselves be more vulnerable to criminal acts against them by reason of their social difficulties.\"</p>",
  "Parish and town councils will be given new powers to deal with antisocial behaviour, the prime minister, Tony Blair, announced this afternoon. <p>He promised that the law would be changed as soon as possible so that smaller authorities will have similar enforcement powers to those which local councils, housing associations and the police already have.</p> <p>Mr Blair said in future he wanted the lowest level of local government, in both rural and urban areas, to have the power to tackle antisocial behaviour and to be able to levy fixed penalty notices for litter dropping, noise nuisance and graffiti.</p> <p>Extending antisocial behaviour powers was one of the three key priorities of the government's continued blitz against antisocial behaviour, the prime minister said.</p> <p>Other priorities were to extend the protection of vulnerable witnesses giving evidence in civil proceedings involving antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos), and the establishment of 13 more specialist courts to fast track the Asbo system, he revealed. </p> <p>Speaking at a London conference to the mark the first anniversary of the antisocial behaviour action plan, Mr Blair said the government was also committed to \"bringing back community policing\".</p> <p>He said the government had changed the law and introduced systems over the last year to tackle antisocial behaviour, but added that this was only half the story.</p> <p>Mr Blair said: \"The thing which has been most inspiring overall is the way that once these powers were there, the police the local authorities and local communities did get together and decide how to use them. But we have got to do that right across the system.\" </p> <p>The prime minister said the drive to beat antisocial behaviour was dependent on a continuing dialogue betweeen \"people and ourselves\".</p>",
  "<p><strong> Internet purchase from Tesco fails to turn up</strong><br> </p> <p>Ordering over the internet is still, for many of us, an act of faith: as we press the \"confirm transaction\" button, a tiny voice at the back of our mind asks whether the goods we have now paid for really will turn up. </p> <p>In April, Jenny Mitcham, of York, thought she would like a new sound system, and saw just the hi-fi she wanted on the Tesco website. She paid \u00a3109 for it, sat back and looked forward to receiving it in, as she thought, a couple of weeks. </p> <p>By the middle of May, no hi-fi had shown up and, as she was about to move house, she contacted Tesco again to make sure the machine was delivered to the correct address. To her surprise, Tesco said it had delivered the hi-fi a fortnight or so earlier. \"I knew this wasn't the case, as neither myself nor my housemate had received or signed for any such delivery,\" says Mitcham. Curious as to who had signed for the package, she asked Tesco to check. Strangely,the company did not come back to her on this, but said instead that a new hi-fi was now on its way. </p> <p>Unfortunately, it did not arrive, so on the day she was moving house Mitcham emailed Tesco again with her new address. The company said the hi-fi was now on its way to her current address. Mitcham then phoned the delivery company and arranged a redirection to her work address at York University. \"I informed the porters and eagerly awaited delivery,\" she says. \"The hi-fi never arrived.\" </p> <p>Mitcham decided she had had enough and asked Tesco for her money back, but was told a new hi-fi would be sent to her new address. Within days there was a knock on the door . . . but, alas, it was once again at the house where she no longer lived. \"My former housemate refused the delivery. By this time, she was getting almost as sick of this fiasco of incompetence as I was,\" says Mitcham. </p> <p>By the end of June, Mitcham had ordered (and received within days) a new hi-fi from another company, but her efforts to get Tesco to refund her money continued as summer turned to autumn. Despite several efforts to cajole Tesco into action, it was weeks before it could get the original signed delivery note to her so she could confirm it was not her handwriting, or the name of anyone known to her; but though she gave this assurance in early August, by mid-October she still had not received her refund. </p> <p><strong> Tesco is, rightly, contrite and says it is the last time anything like this will happen. A spokesperson says the company is really sorry to have let Mitcham down in the way it did. \"We've now resolved the situation and have spoken to her directly to apologise. We will be looking into how this happened so we can ensure it never happens again. We strive to offer all our online customers a satisfactory service and regret that on this occasion we failed to do so.\"</strong> </p> <p><strong> BT customer battles to bar rogue diallers</strong><br> </p> <p> Three weeks ago Consumer featured a story on internet phone scams after receiving letters and emails from many readers who faced shock bills after falling victim to rogue diallers - these horrible bugs hitch themselves to your PC and divert your machine to call an expensive premium-rate number, which you are then billed for. </p> <p>We advised readers wanting to protect themselves to use BT's premium rate and international number call barring, priced \u00a31.50 per month, by calling 150. But one reader who did just that was Hedley Taylor of London, who wrote to tell us the procedure had turned into \"a nightmare experience with the BT monster\". </p> <p>In Taylor's case, the bar wasn't anything like as easy to activate as we had implied: in fact, it took him an entire day of frustrating phone calls during which he was given, he says, an \"enormous amount of misinformation and conflicting information\" and was often kept waiting for more than 15 minutes at a time. </p> <p>One issue that wasn't made clear to Taylor by BT was whether it is necessary, to be safe from rogue diallers, to bar both premium and international calls, or whether a premium rate bar only should do the trick. </p> <p>And it wasn't only Taylor who got in touch after our earlier item. Several other readers also wrote in to ask why, given that those faced with big bills were entirely innocent of them, BT can't just write off their debts and carry the can on their behalf for the scam? </p> <p>In fact, since our earlier item, the premium-rate phone line regulator, Icstis, has announced it is using its emergency powers to shut down all premium-rate dialler services operating without its permission. Which is good news for internet dial-up customers worried about falling prey to the scam, but provides little comfort for the 45,000 or so people currently facing huge bills, some of whom are being chased by debt collectors. </p> <p>We have been in touch with BT again, and they have apologised to Taylor for the poor service he received. and have agreed to pay him \u00a330 compensation. \"We would like to stress that the problems Mr Taylor suffered were in no way typical,\" says a spokesman. \"In fact, putting a removable bar on your home phone line is usually a very simple process, which takes just a few seconds.\" He confirms, too, that to be certain you're safe you should bar both premium-rate and international calls. </p> <p>But in response to the suggestion that BT should shoulder the debts incurred, the spokesman is less forthcoming. The amount involved would, he says, come to around \u00a39m - and of that money, only around \u00a383,000 would be BT profit (the company says it won't profit from the scam, and is donating any money it makes on it to ChildLine). </p> <p>Meanwhile, however, some of those facing big bills have turned to telecoms ombudsman Otelo and to Cisas, the Communications and Internet Services Adjudication Scheme, and there is a glimmer of hope for wronged customers that these bodies may rule in favour of BT and other phone companies waiving all, or part, of a bill. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Anna Tims is away, Joanna Moorhead will be the author of this month's column.

  "More than 60 years on, Fang Shiwei recalls the day his family was torn apart with such clarity it could have happened yesterday. <p>The 77-year-old accountant was a 12-year-old schoolboy in October 1940 when people in his hometown in Zhejiang province, south-east China, began to fall ill.</p> <p>They suffered painful deaths, their bodies weakened, then blackened, by a mysterious illness.</p> <p>Panic swept through the area as groups of local sanitation officials frantically disposed of infected corpses and declared war on the local rat population.</p> <p>The villagers soon realised, however, that this was not a freak outbreak but a deliberate attempt to wipe out civilian populations with what was then the world's biggest and most sophisticated biological weapons programme.</p> <p>Its architect was the occupying Japanese army. On the morning of October 4, 1940, Japanese planes flew over the city of Quzhou and released parcels of rice and wheat, designed to explode in mid-air so that their third ingredient - plague infected fleas - would fall to earth intact.</p> <p>\"We were all extremely afraid,\" Mr Fang said in an interview this week with Guardian Unlimited. After hearing of the rising death toll in the neighbourhood, Mr Fang's family - his mother, father, elder brother and nanny - fled to another village 15km away.</p> <p>By 1942, the plague and other killer diseases had spread to several locations along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway. The Japanese showered seven pathogens on the province in what is thought to have been retaliation for the \"Doolittle\" air raids on Tokyo by US bombers.</p> <p>In addition to the plague, the area was infected with typhoid, typhus, dysentery, cholera, para-typhus and anthrax.</p> <p>Biological warfare finally caught up with Mr Fang and his family. His symptoms began with a tiny blister. \"It was yellow, not red like blisters usually are,\" he said. \"Then it broke, releasing a yellow pus which spread and caused my leg to rot.</p> <p>\"By September we were all suffering from rotting leg disease,\" he said, hitching up his right trouser leg to reveal the scars. \"We also had ulcers all over our bodies.\" They had been infected with anthrax.</p> <p>Mr Fang recovered, and today shows no obvious signs of his ailment. He shed tears as he described the night that his mother, gravely ill with typhoid, begged him for some water. By the time he had lit a fire and boiled a cupful of water, she was dead. He had to borrow wood from an old man in the village to make her a coffin.</p> <p>According to local documents, supported by studies conducted by Japanese researchers, between 1940 and 1948 more than 300,000 Chinese civilians in the region were infected with the plague and other diseases. An estimated 50,000 died in the Quzhou area alone.</p> <p>The reign of terror was the work of the notorious Unit 731, a secret arm of the Japanese army based near Harbin, north-east China, which since 1935 had combined expertise and unspeakable cruelty to develop biological weapons to help pave the Japanese army's way into strategically important areas of south-east China.</p> <p>Between 1939 and 1945, the unit is thought to have killed, maimed or poisoned more than a million mainly Chinese, Russian and Korean civilians by contaminating their water supply and showering towns and villages with pathogens such as the bubonic plague.</p> <p>Known officially as the epidemic prevention and water supply bureau, Unit 731 employed hundreds of doctors and scientists to conduct experiments on prisoners of war and civilians.</p> <p>Described by their captors as \"logs,\" the victims were deliberately infected with disease and then dissected while still alive so that doctors could check the infections' progress.</p> <p>Between 1936 and 1945, the unit killed an estimated 14,000 people, including several allied prisoners of war.</p> <p>Yet its work was to remain secret for years. The unit's activities were referred to just once at the Tokyo war crimes trials. Rather than prosecute the unit's senior members, the US occupation authorities in Japan granted them immunity in exchange for access to years of extensive research into biological weapons.</p> <p>The perpetrators returned to Japan to lead respectable lives, occupying top positions in the pharmaceutical industry and the health ministry. Dr Masaji Kitano, who succeeded the unit's notorious founder, Shiro Ishii, as its leader, went on to head what was once Japan's biggest pharmaceutical firm, Green Cross, which infected 1,800 Japanese haemophiliacs with HIV through unheated blood products in the 1980s.</p> <p>The authorities in Japan have only just begun to acknowledge the unit's existence and the nature of its work, thanks to the testimony of former members such as Yoshio Shinozuka.</p> <p>Shinozuka, who was recruited by the unit when he was 16, testified in 1997 that he had helped breed the fleas that were dropped on Quzhou. He was later responsible for scrubbing down the barely living, blackened bodies of plague victims before they were dissected, without anaesthetic. He testified on behalf of 180 Chinese survivors of the plague attacks and relatives of those who had died after they launched a suit against the Japanese government in 1995. They demanded that Tokyo admit it had used biological weapons, apologise and pay each of them 10m yen in compensation.</p> <p>In its ruling in August 2002, the Tokyo district court acknowledged that Unit 731's activities had caused \"immense\" suffering and were \"clearly inhumane.\" But the admission was a pyrrhic victory for the plaintiffs: the court turned down their other demands, saying that all compensation issues had been settled when Japan and China normalised diplomatic ties in 1972.</p> <p>Today, representatives of the plaintiffs started giving evidence for the last time in their appeal at the Tokyo high court. A ruling is expected within months, but few expect it to go the plaintiffs' way.</p> <p>Their leader, Wang Xuan, whose uncle died from disease spread by Unit 731, says the plaintiffs will take their case to the Japanese supreme court and, if necessary, the United Nations, if their appeal fails.</p> <p>Mr Fang, who is not among the plaintiffs (he learned about the suit in a newspaper article in 1995), said that a favourable ruling would not only help heal the personal wounds inflicted 60 years ago, but would also go some way towards addressing the historical animosity that continues to blight Japan-China relations.</p> <p>His argument, he says, is with Japan's government, not its people. \"They destroyed my family, took away my elder brother and very nearly killed me,\" he said, recalling his capture, then release, by Japanese troops in the dying days of the second world war.</p> <p>\"This was all in the past - it's over. But they should show repentance and demonstrate an honest understanding of their history. Many of the other victims have died, that's why it is so important for me to tell my story.\"</p> <p>Ms Wang, who lives in Japan, said: \"We don't want this to drag on. It doesn't make us happy to have to keep pointing the finger at other people and telling them that they're wrong. All we want is to make peace and see justice done. But it is a painful process.\"</p>",
  "<p>Health unions have expressed fears that the introduction of vetting checks for all NHS staff could result in delays which could hamper service delivery. </p> <p>The concerns follow an announcement made earlier this month by the health minister, John Hutton, that the NHS is set to undergo checks by the beleaguered Criminal Records Bureau for all new recruits who will have access to patients as part of their everyday NHS duties.</p> <p>While most healthcare professions are regulated, a large section of the NHS workforce currently have no regulatory body to ensure their personal credentials. Other NHS workers, such as porters and other non-clinical staff dealing with patients, will also be brought into the fold.</p> <p>The announcement came ahead of a damning report published yesterday by the parliamentary public accounts committee, which found the agency was still not providing all the services it was designed to deliver.</p> <p>The CRB, launched two and a half years ago to check that people working with children or vulnerable adults did not have a criminal background, said it was still \"in discussions\" with the Department of Health over how to implement its recent decision to extend the checks to all staff.</p> <p>But the CRB's track record so far is leaving health professionals unsure of what to expect.</p> <p>Nurses working with children and elderly patients already submitted to checks by the CRB have seen delays of \"weeks rather than days\", and this hampered their ability to continue working, according to the Royal College of Nursing's policy adviser, Tim Curry.</p> <p>\"We have found delays in some other areas, such as learning disability, as well,\" he said. \"CRB checks were delaying things, not massively, but there was a clear difference and it is undermining when you are trying to recruit.\"</p> <p>He lamented the 'lack of consultation' in the design of the CRB, with little explanation given to employers or staff of what to expect.</p> <p>The nursing regulator, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, already insists on vetting checks for nurses before they begin training, and before they register at the end of their course.</p> <p>A spokesman said the new round of mandatory checks for all staff could be seen as overkill. \"It could be argued to be belt and braces or it could also be argued it is superfluous because the checks have already been made.\" </p> <p> Unison said it welcomed the checks, but said the CRB needed to be able to deliver without inconveniencing staff. \"We would be concerned if it turned out the CRB was unable to deliver these checks quickly to make sure people were in place and able to do the job they are employed to do,\" a spokeswoman said. </p> <p>A CRB spokeswoman gave reassurances that the service could comfortably handle the 100,000 checks it expects will result from the recent DoH edict, saying it was small beer in comparison to the 50,000 checks it undertakes each week. </p> <p>The select committee report, published yesterday, is the second in less than a year to point to the CRB's historic failures. </p> <p>A report last February by the government watchdog, the National Audit Office (NAO) said the government opted for the cheapest quote for the service. It said the CRB launched with insufficient provision of services in place, leading to a quick backlog building up.</p>",
  "So it was high noon in Strasbourg, but nobody came. Sheriff Barroso said he needed more time to consider his commission. Lurking up at the railroad, a German member of the gang murmured: \"We are all confident to find a solution\". Then Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering took another menacing swig of Perrier water. Meanwhile, in Washington, two heavily-armed men are striding up main street, each pretending that he's Gary Cooper and the other is the murderous gangster Frank Miller. As surely as the sun rises, there'll be a shoot-out next Tuesday at noon. <p>Contrast the drama of democracy in Washington and Brussels. On the right-hand side of your split screen you have the world's biggest western. Hundreds of millions of people will be watching around the world as Kerry and Bush go mano a mano . We're all familiar with the cast: a handful of big, vivid characters, many of whom look and walk like filmstars. This is a big-budget Hollywood production: an estimated $100m will be spent on political advertising in the last week, perhaps as much as $1bn on the campaign as a whole. It features the most powerful man in the world, as well as war, sex, God and lies. It's a drama that affects us all. \"I'm feeling quite nervous about Tuesday,\" a Pakistani student told me, \"even though it's not my country.\" What film director could ask for more? </p> <p>On the left-hand side of your split screen, you have the postmodern Euro-drama, taken from the Franco-German arts channel Arte, with subtitles. The cast consists of hundreds of characters, most of them totally unknown to most viewers. (P\u00f6ttering? Who, where, why or what is P\u00f6ttering?) They speak 20 different languages, or English of a curious kind. The action takes place mainly behind closed doors, where complex deals are cut in smokeless rooms. Instead of God, war and lies, a typical episode features paragraph 257b of the consolidated widget-straightening directive. Rocco Buttiglione, a genial character from a spaghetti western, is the exception who proves the rule. Yet even the Buttiglione affair seems set to end with an anti-climactic compromise. And who of us feels it will really change our lives, as the American election will? Altogether, then, a film director's worst nightmare. </p> <p>The almost total lack of accessible, engaging political drama is a weakness of European democracy. Indeed, this is one reason we hesitate to speak of \"European democracy\", as opposed to a European Union composed of democracies, which is not the same thing. The original democracy, in ancient Athens, was built around a culture of performance, in political life as in the theatre, the law court, the gymnasium and the symposium. However debased, the spectacle of prime minister's question time in the House of Commons is a vital lifesign of British democracy. But imagine being a sketchwriter in the European parliament. </p> <p>Yet big-budget Hollywood movies aren't always the best, and this American blockbuster has a huge democratic deficit. It's not just that at least half the eligible voters don't vote; we have that problem in Europe too. It's not just that an antiquated electoral system means the candidate who gets most votes can lose, as happened to Al Gore last time. After all, Britain's mother of parliaments has an equally unfair electoral system. It's not merely the sharp practice and even downright fraud that goes on around voter registration, or the way in which this election may be decided by the effectiveness of each side's lawyers, as the last one was decided by the supreme court. </p> <p>No, the worst deformation is the role of money itself. It now seems that you have to be a multi-millionaire before standing for high political office in the United States. Not just Bush and Kerry, but Cheney, Edwards, the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, and the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, are all in that category. Because you have to raise such vast sums as a candidate for president, you go into office beholden to corporate special interests. The Bush administration has made the word Halliburton a worldwide synonym for this kind of politics, replacing the older Tammany Hall with something larger and more barefaced. </p> <p>Washington is also the world mecca of lobbyists. As Fareed Zakaria points out in his book The Future of Freedom, they have the curious effect of making it all but impossible to cut back any federal spending programme, however plainly obsolete. To describe the American political system today, one is tempted to revive a half-forgotten term: plutocracy. </p> <p>Not that Europe is innocent of this. Brussels is another mecca for lobbyists, who sneak through the jungle of committees to change legislation to the advantage of special interests. And a continent that contains Silvio Berlusconi's media monopoly and the Eurosceptic press in Britain should be a little modest when it comes to criticising the horrible distortion of American political debate by the rightwing dominance of talk radio, and the nationalist partisanship of Fox News on television. </p> <p>Yet the European way of politics has strengths, and quiet dramas, of its own. If you go on to the BBC's wonderful website, you can watch a video of our Brussels sheriff, the European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, making his statement to the European parliament. He says, in his slightly accented English, that to try to push through his current proposed commission (with the conservative Catholic Buttiglione responsible for our civil liberties) would not be positive \"for the European institutions or the European project\". Loud applause, punctuated by some boos, sounds from the hall. </p> <p>\"It is better,\" he says quietly, \"to get more time to get it right.\" Not very exciting - but if George Bush had followed that counsel in the run-up to the Iraq war, we'd be in a far better state today. Then the Spanish president of the parliament responds, in Spanish. \"A tower of Babel!\" you may snort; but you could also say that there's something bold and even revolutionary in trying to make a parliament work in 20 different tongues. It reminds me of sitting in the South African parliament a few years ago, listening to members speaking in 11 different languages. Difficult, but inspiring. </p> <p>If you look at the biographies of the more than 700 members of this new parliament, you find former dissidents, writers, scholars, unionists, economists and youth activists, as well as the usual dreary party functionaries, from 25 different countries. A collection of people infinitely more diverse and interesting than the US Congress; a kind of anthology of European history over the past half-century. Out of that history, and this complex political system, comes a politics of peaceful negotiation, consensus and compromise, not of high noon and winner-takes-all. Less dramatic, less fun, to be sure; but not necessarily worse. Given the choice between a Cheney and a P\u00f6ttering, I'd choose P\u00f6ttering any day. I say: let Europe keep P\u00f6ttering on. </p> <p>Here, then, is the Discreet Charm of Eurodemocracy, a film by Bu\u00f1uel, not Spielberg. Of course, we'll all be watching the American blockbuster on Tuesday night, and few will tune in to the Brussels arthouse movie. Real life is a different matter. We love watching LAPD, but we'd rather live in Provence. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.freeworld.web\">www.freeworld.web</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Life before </strong><br></p> <p>I've always had a slight problem with the term \"local community\". What exactly do people mean by it? I can understand it in the context of living in the countryside, where villages and even towns can more readily define a community's boundaries, but in a city such as London, where I live, it's a little harder to pin down a definition. Is the local community the street or estate you live on? Or is it one of the many other \"links\" people have: the postal code, the local authority, the parish, the train station, the football club, the school catchment area, the supermarket catchment area, the parliamentary constituency, or even the city as a whole?</p> <p>Even if I, somewhat arbitrarily, assume it to mean anyone living within a two-mile radius, I can't really boast much of a track record in working to improve the local community. Instead I can trot out some lame \"I'm-just-too-busy-to-find-time\" excuses: baby to raise, full-time job, that kind of thing. The most I can offer in the way of having any track record in giving time to others, in fact, is that during my sixth-form years I used to help out at the local hospital radio.</p> <p><strong> The ethical audit</strong><br></p> <p>The auditors: <strong> Hannah Berry</strong>, writer and researcher at Ethical Consumer magazine; <strong> Mike Childs</strong>, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth; <strong> Renee Elliott</strong>, council member of the Soil Association and founder of Planet Organic shops</p> <p>\"So what do you do for your local community?\"</p> <p>The question hangs in the air for an uncomfortable period of time.</p> <p>\"Well, I don't do volunteering for the local meals-on-wheels or pull shopping trolleys from canals, if that's what you mean,\" I respond, a little pathetically. \"We haven't lived in the area for too long, but we are getting to know more people. Is that what you mean?\"</p> <p>The auditors ask Jane and I if we vote. Always, we respond.</p> <p>Do we use locally owned and run shops? We probably used to more, but then a Sainsbury's Local opened up nearby.</p> <p>Do we know which councillor represents the ward we live in? No.</p> <p>Does anything about the area you live in annoy you? Beyond the obvious inner-city gripes, such as litter, graffiti, fear of crime and such like, we mention that the acquisition of the school behind our house by property developers concerns us - as it does many other local residents.</p> <p>\"By not getting involved with your local community,\" says Mike, \"you are probably missing out on opportunities to influence what goes on in your area and help shape a community that you want to live in.\"</p> <p>Mike adds that the first step towards feeling more empowered is to engage more with local democracy. \"The quality of life in your local community is very much affected by the actions of your local authority,\" he says. \"But how can you object to, say, plans concerning the redevelopment of the school if you don't even know who to contact about the decision? It has to be said that local authorities don't make it easy for people to comment on plans, or for people to give feedback on the quality of the services they offer. But local councils are getting better at it. If people don't engage with their local councillors and let them know what they think the council is doing well or what it should be doing better, then they cannot really complain when they fail to perform.\"</p> <p>Hannah is keen to get Jane and me to pin down exactly what we think the term \"local community\" really means for us: \"Is it the street you live in, your local friends with similar aspirations, or something else? A central criticism of the 'gentrification' of places like Brixton where you live is that middle-class home-buyers such as yourselves change the nature of the community precisely through their lack of desire to be part of it. Existing residents of a place like Brixton, which is known for its vibrancy, street life, pubs, busy market and multiculturalism, may well resent newcomers who spend no money with local businesses and take little interest in the area. Could you, for example, reverse your shopping habits and visit the supermarket just for items unavailable or unaffordable locally?\"</p> <p>This is a subject that sparks Renee's interest. \"For me, supporting the local community means buying local goods from local, independent stores where possible. Supporting your local economy - whether local means, say, the village, Yorkshire, or even Britain - is good for jobs and the economy of your own region and country. It is best because you're also not travelling unnecessarily.\"</p> <p>But it should go wider than just supporting local shops, says Mike. \"Supporting local services, such as libraries and swimming pools, also gives the clear message that these facilities are needed and wanted by local people.\"</p> <p>Hannah asks us if we buy a local weekly paper to keep abreast of local issues. I say that this is actually a bit of a bugbear of mine as I have searched high and low for a news-agent that will deliver newspapers but all of them say that, despite their best efforts, they can't find anyone who will do a paper round. I say that I would certainly be interested in receiving a local paper if it was delivered, but that it doesn't really cross my mind to pick one up otherwise.</p> <p>\"OK, well why not join the Brixton section of the online Urban 75 forum (<a href=\"http://www.urban75.org\">www.urban75.org</a>)?\" she says. \"When 28 African asylum seekers were stranded locally, Urban 75 members quickly knew and could take over food and blankets and fire off press releases to alert the media.\"</p> <p>Hannah adds that we should ask ourselves the question, \"Who is poor and why?\" \"Global social justice issues play out in Britain's cities as much as on the coffee plantations of Colombia. Are corporate interests displacing people or threatening a way of life? With its slightly fragmented but still strong radical counterculture, Brixton is an ideal place to live if you want to grapple with concepts of power structures, ethics and resistance. You could help, say, groups fighting displacement or support positive eco-initiatives such as community gardens. You should also interrupt racist or classist comments when you come across them.\"</p> <p>Mike says that he took the time before arriving at our house to research how many local groups there were near to us seeking help. \"Local community organisations and charities are often looking for volunteers and for financial support. According to <a href=\"http://www.upmystreet.com\">www.upmystreet.com</a>, there are 60 different charities and voluntary organisations within a mile of your home, so there are plenty of opportunities to get involved.\"</p> <p><strong> Life after</strong><br></p> <p>Neither Jane or I were really sure where to start. Some things sounded as if they should be quite easy to incorporate, such as frequenting more local shops, but the bigger themes such as \"grappling with power structures\" all seemed a little heady for us. We've never really seen ourselves as the grappling type. I might have signed the odd petition if someone in the street asked me, but that's often more out of embarrassment of saying no rather than being sympathetic to their cause per se. I've never been on a march or picketed outside the town hall, for example. In fact, the closest I ever get to the white heat of democracy in action is probably watching Question Time.</p> <p>Much of what the auditors had to say seemed to boil down to urging us to donate some of our time, not to our own needs, but to that of the wider community. Both of us agreed that this was indeed a noble sentiment; it was just a question of finding something, or someone, that might benefit from such a gesture.</p> <p>Then I received an email at work asking for volunteers for community projects near the office. I had seen this email do the rounds before but, even though I had been interested, had never acted on it, even though I knew that 100 or so people in the company take part. But re-reading the email seemed to directly answer one of my biggest concerns: namely, just when was I going to find the time to volunteer when I already struggled to clear any spare time in the day? The answer, as the email pointed out, was to give up my lunch hour once a week, a period of the day that can hardly be said to be the most productive time I spend, considering that it usually amounts to reading sports reports or sitting in the park. So I put my name down to help out with one-to-one reading during the \"Literacy Hour\" at a local primary school.</p> <p>Within a couple of weeks I was attending a training session with Community Service Volunteers (<a href=\"http://www.csv.org.uk\">www.csv.org.uk</a>), the UK's largest volunteer organisation, which oversees the scheme.</p> <p>I was more than a little nervous when it came to the first reading session. Thirty-odd children all looked at me quizzically as they came running in from the playground, no doubt wondering who on earth this tall man standing awkwardly in the corner next to their \"Countries of the World\" wall display was.</p> <p>Alfie was chosen as my first reader and he walked off to the reading corner to choose Where Are You, Blue Kangaroo? as our first book - a book I now know almost by heart. A term later I had been phonetically read the complete repertoire of reading corner with a selection of wonderfully engaging members of class 2P.</p> <p>It sounds a little silly now, but in the first few weeks when I started I used to feel guilty that I was actually enjoying it. I'm not sure why, but I used to feel that volunteering should be about suffering for a cause. It took me a while to learn that it only really works when both parties get something out of it.</p> <p>This school term I started mentoring at a local secondary school where English is a second language for over 50% of pupils - the theory being that I can hopefully guide, in some small way, a 14-year-old through their GCSEs and beyond. The reality was that, on our first encounter, it was me doing the learning: I went back to work knowing how to say \"My name is Leo\" in Bengali.</p> <p><strong>Do try this at home</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Join the 22 million people in the UK who volunteer.

  "<p>The cheekbones, the bob, the bare feet: Sandie Shaw remains one of the most potent icons of the 1960s. Now in her late 50s with cheekbones and bob intact, she couldn't think of anything more ridiculous than her iconic status. \"I think it's so funny, whenever people ask me about it. I don't know what they're talking about to be honest!\" </p> <p>For years, there has been little but half-hearted repackaging of her best-known songs. Now, there's a flurry of releases: a four-CD boxed set she gleefully describes as \"warts and all\"; compilations of her French, German, Spanish and Italian language recordings - a \"new way of looking at the work\", and two reissues. </p> <p>The first, Reviewing the Situation, is a 1969 album Shaw produced herself of her favourite songs from the era; at the time, it barely had a release at all. The second album, Hello Angel, was released on Rough Trade in 1988 and reunited her with the composer of the bulk of her 1960s material, Chris Andrews. But none of this, she says, firmly and without fuss, constitutes a comeback. She is too busy, and too fulfilled by her work at the Arts Clinic, the London-based counselling practice she runs for creative people. </p> <p>She knows too well the particular problems engendered by the entertainment industry. Discovered by Adam Faith, the girl from Dagenham had her first number one single - the Burt Bacharach/Hal David classic (There's) Always Something There to Remind Me - while still a teenager. Between October 1964 and February 1969 she had eight top 10 singles, including three number ones, and won the Eurovision Song Contest with Puppet on a String, a song she used to loathe but now \"doesn't mind\" to the extent that she has it as her mobile phone ring tone. </p> <p>What followed inspired Shaw's most famous fan, Morrissey, to write the lyric: \"Did that swift eclipse torture you?\" If torture is too strong a word, certainly the fallout from the 1960s was not pleasant. Shaw refers to the 1970s as \"the dark ages\". She recorded sporadically and without commercial success. Her marriage to designer Jeff Banks collapsed. She tried acting, playing St Joan, which she loved, and Ophelia, though she found the mad sister somewhat drippy, preferring the \"rude and wonderful\" Hamlet. The one good thing to come out of this unhappy time was her discovery, through the musician Ann O'Dell, of Buddhism, for which Shaw remains a subtle but unequivocal evangelist. </p> <p>The 1980s brought marriage to Nik Powell, co-founder of Palace Pictures, and rediscovery by a new generation of musicians, particularly Morrissey, who was no doubt irked that it was Heaven 17 who finally brought his heroine out of apparent retirement. Recording as the British Electric Foundation, in 1982 they produced Music of Quality and Distinction Volume 1, an album of their favourite performers singing their favourite sings. Shaw sang another Bacharach/David classic, Anyone Who Had Heart, because she had never had the chance to before. It was the beginning of her rebirth. </p> <p>In 1983, after Rough Trade label boss Geoff Travis took a nervous Morrissey to meet his idol for the first time, Shaw released a cover of the Smiths' debut single Hand in Glove, which made number 27. Backing her on Top of the Pops, the Smiths took their shoes off in tribute. Morrissey himself twirled in the background and Shaw writhed on the floor. </p> <p>The same year also saw the extremely limited release of the album Choose Life, made with a very different group of musicians. Although she had written in the past, mostly for other singers, this was the first significant songwriting Shaw had done for herself. \"It took me a long time,\" she says. \"I financed the recordings myself, and I released it for a Buddhist peace expo that went on for about a month in Kensington.\" Three years later, when she briefly found herself signed to Polydor, she hoped her A&amp;R woman, whom she'd known through Powell, would release the album. She didn't. \"I suppose it was a taste of what artists go through,\" Shaw says, clearly still disappointed but not bitter. \"It was interesting for me, because I'd had success almost immediately the first time around.\" </p> <p>Two singles released for Polydor, including a lovely cover of Lloyd Cole's Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken, failed even to dent the top 40. Look on the B-sides, however, and you'll find two sparkling Shaw co-writes: Johnny Guitar, partly about Johnny Marr, partly inspired by Chuck Berry, but also about \"the lead guitar thing, which is always the same\"; and Steven, whose lines, though intended to be \"tongue-in-cheek\", comprise some of the most perceptive writing about Morrissey ever. </p> <p>Disillusioned with Polydor, she moved to Rough Trade and began work on Hello Angel, with Stephen Street - then collaborating with Morrissey on his solo debut, Viva Hate - doing most of the producing. As well as the songs Shaw had written with Andrews, material was chosen from other writers who excited her, including the notoriously gruff Jesus and Mary Chain (\"They were so nice\") and Mike Scott of the Waterboys (\"wonderful\"). Morrissey donated the brassy romp Please Help the Cause Against Loneliness, which didn't fit the bitter cast of Viva Hate, and Andrews and Shaw came up with Nothing Less Than Brilliant, which captured perfectly the liberating thrill of the whole project. </p> <p>Travis was fascinated by the prospect of working \"with someone who'd been present at these seminal moments in pop history\". Before the release of Please Help the Cause as a single, he remembers, \"Morrissey wrote me a note, saying: 'This is our chance to make Sandie a star again.' It was very sweet.\" He pauses. \"Actually, it was more of a command.\" </p> <p>However, neither Please nor Nothing Less than Brilliant, the follow up, received significant radio support; neither charted. Nor did their parent album, though it sold \"respectably\". It didn't help that Rough Trade was heading into difficulties that would eventually result in Travis losing control of the name for a few years. In a way, though, Hello Angel was a success for Shaw before it even reached the shops. Was she bothered that the records didn't chart? </p> <p>\"I think Geoff was bothered, I think he thought he'd lost the record. He thought he'd let me down. He hadn't. But he felt bad, and that's how I got the tapes back - he gave them to me. They did their best, I think. It was fine - like being a proper indie artist. It was a new thing for me!\" She has, she says, never worried about chart positions: \"Once it's on vinyl it's there for ever.\" </p> <p>She regards The World at My Feet, the 1992 autobiography that jump-cuts revealingly between the 1960s and the 1980s, as her next album and since then, simply hasn't felt the incentive to sing. If that seems like a shame, it doesn't to Shaw. Nor does she feel thwarted or frustrated. \"If I wanted to sing I could. It's not what I want now. I'm cured!\" She laughs - and when Shaw laughs, she really laughs. \"I'm joking! To guest on somebody's thing, that would be different.\" The star-making machinery behind the popular song - in Joni Mitchell's words - has no appeal. Shaw is also conscious of the difficulties of making the right record, and trading on the past in the wrong way would be \"death\" to her. </p> <p>\"I can't tell what we went through just trying to get my photo taken. I don't have the time to invest in those narcissistic pursuits. And I wouldn't want to let anybody down. I don't like being famous, that's not an incentive. Perhaps to be involved in a project - involved, not leading.\" Jane Birkin's recent album Arabesque, in which she reinvented the songs of her late husband Serge Gainsbourg as if confronting his ghost, \"felt right\", Shaw says, \"but another record from Cher? No thanks.\" </p> <p>What clearly does turn her on (though she's currently on sabbatical) is her work at the Arts Clinic, which offers \"psychological well-being services for those in the creative industries\". At the beginning of the 1990s, Shaw went to London University, studying psychodynamic counselling at Birkbeck College, at the same time as her daughter Gracie was studying English at University College, just down the road. (\"We seem to do things in tandem,\" Gracie, Shaw's daughter by Jeff Banks, says now). By the end of the decade she was the head of a successful practice. </p> <p>Still, never to hear her sing again feels like a loss. She pauses. \"Today's the answer's 'no',\" she says, \"but tomorrow... the answer's 'maybe'.\" If Shaw were not the ebullient, mischievous woman she has grown into, there would be an ineffable sadness about someone whose stardom appeared so effortless yet who was \"never comfortable\" as a star. There isn't. </p> <p>\"It was easier at the beginning but it got madder and madder as the music business developed,\" she says. \"It became an industry. It became a career. You have to see where it begins and where it ends or you can't be involved with other people. Within itself it's real, but it's not reality. I've known songwriters jump from woman to woman because they want something to write about. I can express my life in lots of different ways: as a clinician, as a Buddhist, as a mother. It's not something that can be pinned down. It's the biggest adventure you'll ever have.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The box set, Nothing Comes Easy, is released by EMI on November 8.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q</strong> I have studied one year in business and two years of english with drama at university. during my second year I fell pregnant and decided to take a break. It is not financially possible for me to return to study at the moment and I am looking for advice as to how to start on the career ladder. I am interested in jobs in the media/arts but need some assistance. I am also living in the north and if necessary am willing to relocate. How do I start? Who can help? </p> <p><strong>A</strong> As a first step a visit to your local Information Advice and Guidance (IAG) centre where you can have a chat with a personal careers adviser. Local IAG centre is a partnership of organisations who offer information, advice and guidance on learning and work opportunities. You will have access to various printed materials, computer software and audiovisual materials to check out different careers in your chosen field.</p> <p>You can also ask for a confidential interview to help you identify your skills and experience, and to talk about the options that may be open to you. The guidance centre will help you plan a way to achieving the learning and work options you want. The centre can also organise help with motivation/confidence building, psychometric testing and writing CVs. </p> <p>Your local reference library will have contact details of your nearest IAG centre. </p> <p>As you live up north, check out NorthWest WorkPlace, which has a useful jobseekers'<a href=\"http://www.northwestworkplace.co.uk/\"> website</a>. </p> <p>The site covers job opportunities in Cheshire, Cumbria, greater Manchester, Merseyside and Lancashire. Plus you can ask about funding for any further training. You may be eligible for an individual training grant or a lifelong learning grant. </p> <p>As for job opportunities, you might want to use your drama studies to try your hand in the leisure and entertainment sector. Some work is arts-based, as with theatres and concert halls. Other jobs cover social activities such as cinemas and discos. The main responsibility is to organise a range of activities from films, discos, plays, operas and bingo to attract as many people as possible. </p> <p>The number of entertainment/leisure centres are growing fast, most of them have several cinemas, restaurants and other facilities that may have vacancies where you could use your business knowledge. </p> <p>Some local authorities also own and run entertainment venues in particular theatres and concert halls. It may be worth a try to see if you can land a job as part of a regional theatre's stage management team. The stage management team organises the production environment. They ensure the availability of rehearsal space, conduct rehearsals, supervise getting in and out of a venue, and ensure props and equipment are available and maintained. They also gather, record and disseminate production information to other theatre departments. </p> <p>However the working hours typically include regular unsocial hours which may be difficult with your childcare responsibilities.</p>",
  "<p>It is a curious phrase, in many ways, \"career sexism\". At first I thought Patricia Hewitt was announcing the name of one of those new degree courses at former polytechnics, the kind that get middle England hot under the collar by not being maths or taught on slates with squeaky pencils. I imagined there would be modules on how to appoint secretaries who only wear pencil skirts and seamed stockings, and seminars on the art of pressing up against work-experience girls in the stationery cupboard (\"Is that a packet of Pentels in my pocket or am I just pleased to see you?\"). The course would culminate in a series of stringent practical examinations in leering, coffee-ordering and arse-slapping. </p> <p>But it was not to be. In fact, the minister for women and trade and industry secretary was announc ing a new drive against the gender pay gap and career segregation. While women now make up 49% of the workforce, they are concentrated in the poorer-paid sectors such as nursing, childcare, sales and administration. Fewer than one in 10 of those working in engineering is a woman, and you could throw a backwater valve through a plumbing convention without much danger of hitting a female practitioner of the art. </p> <p>The government intends to change all this by providing girls with more career advice on \"masculine\" jobs, providing universities with funding to help their female science and engineering graduates find jobs, and by strewing adult education institutions with \"taster courses\" for those who want to sample non-traditional employment roles - construction for women, childcare for men, say. </p> <p>Perhaps my initial confusion arose because it is such a long time since anyone used the word \"sexism\" in private, let alone in public life. Despite the government's obsession with modernity and innovation, the word is inextricably linked to the 70s, when raised consciousnesses reached critical mass, forced the first \"official\" recognition and naming of the problem, and ensured that it became part of the (famously) personal and political debate. These days, it conjures up images of Benny Hill comedies, bosses who thought nothing of groping their secretaries as the mood took them, and husbands who expected a wife/doormat to be waiting for them when they came home from a hard day's work at Where's My Dinner? Ltd. So it seems, on the face of it, an odd term to choose when the past 30 years have been spent identifying the issues and dividing an initially amorphous and apparently intractable problem into discrete areas that are easier to tackle: pay, maternity rights, discrimination in the workplace, rape, domestic violence and the thousand other ills that feminine flesh is heir to. </p> <p>But, consciously or unconsciously, Hewitt's new focus on \"sexism\" is an acknowledgment of how signally the individualised approach has failed in its mission to improve the lives of working women. We may have divided the issues, but we have not conquered them. The pay gap between men and women stubbornly persists (currently standing at 19.5%, 1.5% more than previous estimates), while rafts of anti-discrimination legislation have somehow failed to prevent bosses taking one look at a pregnant employee and replacing her forthwith with someone less likely to harbour a penchant for repopulation. The employment tribunals are stuffed to the quasi-judicial rafters with women who are still unable to persuade their employers that sexual intercourse or badinage with the boss is not an implied term of their contract. </p> <p>The sexist boss so soundly trounced by Dolly Parton and co in 9 to 5 has not, after all, disappeared, but is endlessly reincarnated, most recently in the unlovely forms of MEP Godfrey Bloom (\"no self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age\") and the Italian minister for Europe, Rocco \"Children who have only a mother are the children of a not very good mother\" Buttiglione. David Brent's cackhanded stabs at gender equality might have been played for laughs, but there is nothing funny about Merrill Lynch employee Stephanie Villalba's sex discrimination case, in which she alleges that she was told to serve male colleagues with drinks on a business flight. (The case is soon to be decided.) And over in America, Lee Scott, the head of WalMart, is currently facing the biggest sex discrimination case of them all, brought by 1.5 million underpaid and undervalued supermarket workers. </p> <p>Even when there is good news, such as the fact that women now out number men in the lower ranks of many formerly exclusively male professions (including law, medicine and the civil service fast track), it can always be countered with bad; the fact that the senior ranks will remain a male preserve until an unprecedented level of childcare provision is put in place, or the news that female solicitors start on salaries an average of 7.9% lower than those of their male counterparts. Then there is the fact that all the good news tends to benefit only the tiny sliver of the female population whose sights are trained on the professions, and is no use at all to the vast majority of women in other kinds of employment. </p> <p>The use of the S-word might, in fact, be the first recorded instance of the government genuinely engaging in joined-up thinking. The natural inclination of politicians is to try to divorce cause and effect wherever possible, so that the free-floating latter can be usefully attached to whatever cause is expedient at the time, or to none at all. Thus the rise in crime is down to the 60s, crowded roads have nothing to do with transport policy, childhood obesity is caused by bad parenting, and corporate crime is caused by getting caught. </p> <p>The practice of particularising the issues has its merits - practical solutions can be applied only to definable and demonstrable inequalities, and to some extent have been - but it has become unfashionable to label the underlying cause as sexism. Maybe it is because we don't want to admit that we have only been suppressing the symptoms and have made no real progress with stamping out the disease. Maybe it is because we increasingly shy away from anything that has connotations of culpability for anyone - in this case, men. Or maybe it is because, after all this time, some women are too worried about being tarred with the feminist brush, or of losing their tenuous hold on what limited power they have to agitate for greater change. Whatever the reason, and even though the No 11 summit at which Hewitt was speaking was inspired by the desperate need to pump young blood, any young blood, into Britain's various ailing industrial sectors (rather than a more noble desire for parity between the sexes), the minister for women should be congratulated for doing something as un-Blairite as calling a spade a spade and using it to start digging at the root of an age-old problem.</p>",
  "Four Britons who said they were tortured in a Saudi jail have won an appeal against a ruling that they could not claim damages in the UK. <p>The four are fighting to clear their names after being detained over a series of bombings in the kingdom four years ago. The Saudis blamed the attacks - in which two people, including a Briton, were killed - on an alcohol turf war between westerners.</p> <p>Ron Jones, an accountant who is claiming \u00a32m in damages, says he was tortured into confessing to a terrorist bombing in Riyadh. The others, Sandy Mitchell, Les Walker and Bill Sampson say they were tortured into confessing on Saudi television. </p> <p>Lawyers said today's ruling by the Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips, sitting with Lord Justice Mance and Lord Justice Neuberger, means that while the men will not be able to pursue their actions against the Saudi government, they will be able to do so against the individual alleged torturers. </p> <p>Mr Jones said he was very happy at the decision. </p> <p>\"I think that their lordships have made a monumental judgment,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It's basically saying there is no blanket immunity for torturers in this country and they will be dealt with under English law, and I think that is a magnificent step forward for [dealing with] human rights' abusers - and that's terrific.\"</p> <p>Mr Mitchell said: \"Obviously I'm pleased - not so much for the sake of ourselves but any other torture victims which Saudi Arabia might produce in the future. It's a step in the right direction that they can't hide behind international law. The law applies to everyone.\" </p> <p>Solicitor Geoffrey Bindman said: \"This judgment means that they, and other victims of torture abroad, may have redress in the British courts. The impact will be felt worldwide. So far the Saudi government has not accepted responsibility for the actions of their officials. It must now do so.\"</p> <p>Lord Justice Mance concluded that a foreign state cannot have any \"absolute right to claim immunity in respect of civil claims against its officials for systematic torture, even committed outside the country of suit\". </p> <p>The judge said he did not think it would mean torture claims throughout the world would automatically come to England because it would always be necessary to establish whether it was possible for the English courts to exercise jurisdiction.</p> <p>The judge ruled that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia \"has not made good its blanket claim to state immunity in respect of the civil proceedings for torture brought against the individual defendants\". </p> <p>In July last year senior High Court official Master Whitaker \"struck out\" Mr Jones's claim against the Saudi government for more than \u00a32m on the ground of \"state immunity\". He later made the same ruling against the other three men.</p>",
  "<p>When is a film British? When its American star manages to produce an Irish passport to prove that it's British. Confused? So were the producers of The River King, a thriller which is due for release early next year, and which the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has just declared - provisionally at least - to be British. </p> <p>At the beginning of this year, The River King, starring the American actor Edward Burns and British actress Jennifer Ehle, nearly foundered in the murky waters of international film financing on two occasions. In February, the unexpected closure of a tax loophole reduced its $13m (\u00a37.1m) budget by a third. The producers restructured the film as an Anglo-Canadian production, restoring the budget. </p> <p>Then, in March, the DCMS deemed that the film wasn't British enough to qualify for the UK's Section 48 tax break, a ruling which also led to the withdrawal of Canadian subsidies and, once again, the reduction of the budget by about 30%. The script had to be cut and rewritten, cast and crew had to defer half their fees and the production lost six shooting days. </p> <p>In Variety, the film's British director Nick Willing put on a brave face: \"The changes, the cuts, the sacrifices we made brought out an energy and a feeling that otherwise wouldn't have been there. When you lose so much time, it does focus the mind on what's really important.\" </p> <p>Finally, the realisation that Burns possessed an Irish passport proved crucial. He therefore qualified as an EU citizen, a discovery that seemed to improve the mood of the DCMS. </p> <p>The very British Alison Owen sympathises. Tulip Fever, on which she was a producer, stopped production in February because of the ending of a tax break. </p> <p>\"[On a co-production] you must bring roughly 50% of the money and talent from both countries,\" says Owen. \"So if you've only got one cameraman from the UK and 17 other crew from abroad, you'll have to rethink.\" </p> <p>The tax benefits of a co-production can be considerable, but, she says, they are subject to strict rules. \"If an actor says he has a British passport, he may have lived for a long time in the States - so you had better check that he does have that passport.\"</p>",
  "<p>With the hype-shower surrounding GTA San Andreas reaching monsoon proportions, one minor element of the game has emerged as a genuine talking point: eating.</p> <p>If you've not <a href=\"http://www.computerandvideogames.com/r/?page=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/news/news_story.php(que)id=107373\">read</a> about this feature, lead character Carl Johnson must eat regularly to stay alive. The catch is, everything available for consumption in the game has a calorific attribute \u2013 if you stuff his face with french fries and burgers, he'll put on weight. Lots of weight.</p> <p>And this has gameplay consequences \u2013 he won't be able to run as fast, he'll get short of breath, he'll actually be laughed at by other characters. Starve him, though, and he'll be too scrawny to pick up heavy objects or indulge in hand-to-hand combat.</p> <p>The idea is to build up body mass, but then put Carl through his paces in the gym to convert it all to muscle. Body image has become a game design feature. Is this a good thing?</p> <p>What impact will it have on our relationship with game heroes? In the past, human characters have mostly been idealised objects \u2013 the mutant fantasy figure of Lara Croft, the lithe muscular physique of beat 'em up heroes like Tekken's Martial Law and Virtua Fighter's Akira.</p> <p>Only comedy characters like Mario, and self-conscious geeks like Gordon Freeman have successfully strayed from gaming's Eugenic prototypes.</p> <p>Of course, idealised representations like Lara bring a whole series of issues, but at least they provide unmalleable physical constants \u2013 and they can be understood as escapism. With GTA San Andreas, whatever issues the individual gamer has with food, and with their own appearance, could well feed into and (literally) shape the lead character.</p> <p>Carl Johnson, unlike Lara Croft, is not going to represent an escape from everyday body image issues \u2013 instead, the gameplay is an extension of those concerns into the virtual space.</p> <p>I get the weird feeling a taboo is being broken. A videogame character being picky about what he eats, being judged on his physical appearance \u2013 it's something quite new. Of course, I'm not suggesting that the use of food itself is a revelation \u2013 this, of course, goes way back to Pac-Man, and is also going to be a staple element in <a href=\"http://www.konamijpn.com/products/mgs3/english/\">Metal Gear Solid 3</a> (Solid Snake must hunt for and eat wild animals to survive in the game's jungle setting).</p> <p>But usually the gamer's control over food intake is a very limited mechanic. In most titles, food is merely something you pick up to replenish health \u2013 the more you eat, the better.</p> <p>The Tamagotchi phenomenon introduced a more caring, more human element, in that you had to supply just the right amount of food to ensure your pet's health. However, your relationship with the onscreen character was not one of identification; no one actually wanted to <em>be</em> a Tamagotchi.</p> <p>But in the GTA series, the lead character's cool factor is central, he is aspirational. And now his body is under our direct control. Will we feel like failures if he develops a paunch and can't smack the bad guys hard enough? Will players, completely unconsciously, project their own eating habits onto the character? And where will this lead?</p> <p>The Sims 2, with its emphasis on relationship-building, explores similar social and image issues, and the two titles together could well give birth to a new era of games in which body image becomes a central component. The thought of dieting sims aimed at teenagers is ghastly, but not entirely unimaginable. 'Help Stacy achieve her perfect figure! Go for dinner with friends, but make sure she opts for the low-fat salad dressing, and no dessert! Lose twenty pounds in the gym and get the man of Stacey's dreams!'</p> <p>More positively, perhaps players will begin to use Johnson's weight as a means of stamping individuality onto their game, deliberately choosing a certain type of body image \u2013 like those create-your-own-fighter options in the latest wrestling titles.</p> <p>We're not sure how advanced the relationship is between diet and character ability in San Andreas, but it might also be possible to transmogrify the lead character depending on your gameplay style \u2013 opting for a skinny-ass if you're after a stealth experience, or piling on the muscle if your approach is more combat-based. This, of course, reflects the ability to choose different nano-tech body upgrades in Deus Ex, depending on if you wanted to employ a stealth or action-orientated strategy. But in GTA, this takes on a more fleshy, more corporeal dimension.</p> <p>San Andreas, then, will raise some interesting questions regarding our relationship with game characters and the ways in which they do, and do not, represent us. These will be difficult questions to answer.</p>",

  "<p>George Bush may be neck-and-neck in the polls with John Kerry, but there is at least one survey that puts him on top - as cinema's best baddie.</p> <p>The American president was awarded the dubious honour of Movie Villain of the Year for his part in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 by 10,000 film fans polled by Total Film magazine.</p> <p>Mr Bush beat stiff competition from Spider-Man 2's Doctor Octopus, played by Alfred Molina, and from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's wannabe lumberjack, Leatherface. Even Gollum from The Lord of the Rings and Kill Bill assassin Elle Driver, played by Daryl Hannah, proved no match for the White House's current tenant.</p> <p>Total Film editor Matt Mueller said Mr Bush was \"absolutely terrifying\" in Fahrenheit 9/11: \"He looked like a man who had lost control - the famous scene where he sits there in a school, absolutely paralysed, after being told about the twin towers, is just one example.</p> <p>\"Lots of people saw [the movie] and movie-goers are saying that there's no one like George Bush to strike fear into people's hearts.\"</p>",
  "<p>The supermarket chain Asda certainly thought so, and stuck labels on their mangoes declaring as much. But this week, the chain was fined \u00a35,000 after Swindon borough council took court action. The offence? Breaching 1996 labelling regulations that make it a crime to say a food prevents, treats or cures a disease. </p> <p>The offending label, in full, read: \"Mangoes are a great source of vitamin C and beta carotene which are good for healthy eyes and skin. Their antioxidant properties help to fight cancer. Try adding mango to smoothies, fruit salad or breakfast cereal.\" </p> <p>According to an Asda spokesman, objections came from councillors who feared that cancer sufferers might buy mangoes in the hope it would help cure their disease. </p> <p>The supermarket, which has pledged to fight for a change in the law, fell foul of the legislation by overstating the benefits of mangoes. </p> <p>\"Mangoes certainly contain the ingredients they say, and there's considerable evidence that diets rich in vitamin C and carotenoids reduce the risks of all those diseases we associate with ageing, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease,\" said a spokeswoman for the Institute of Food Research in Norwich. In the eyes of the law, however, claiming mangoes fight cancer was going too far. </p> <p>News of the ruling is likely to raise eyebrows in the US. In 2001, the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences issued a press release entitled: \"Researchers say munch more mangoes to fight cancer.\" Scientists at the institute exposed mouse cells to a cancer-causing chemical and then to an extract made from pureed mangoes. They found the extract inhibited the growth of cancer cells. </p> <p>\"We think mangoes have some unique antioxidants as well as quantities of antioxidants that might not be found in other fruits and vegetables,\" said researcher Susan Percival. </p> <p>Asda maintains that the labels were used in good faith as a means of encouraging customers to eat more fruit and vegetables. \"It could have been worded better, but all we were trying to do was promote the health benefits of fruit and vegetables,\" said an Asda spokesman. </p> <p>\"This a real mango fandango,\" said Asda's private label director. \"We're in the dock for saying fruit is good for you.\"</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> Generally, I don't go for the little guys. But when the seventh copy of the Brain Respiration leaflet arrived in the Bad Science mailbag, I knew it was a serious moneyspinner: a multimillion dollar operation, in fact, with four centres in the UK, and headed by spiritual leader Dr Ilchi Lee, who runs international conferences, attended, he claims, by Al Gore. I don't know if his doctorate is in neurosciences but he's certainly made some breakthroughs with his \"brain sensitising, brain versatilising, brain cleansing, brain re-wiring, and brain mastering\". Especially since it can \"refresh the brain's energy and help it create new brain cells for stronger brain function\", which is amazing given the conventional wisdom that you don't make any new brain cells after you're born. So you might want to protect the few you have left from brain respiration, especially since \"this process goes beyond the anatomical layer of the neo-cortex ... into the realm of the brain stem (where innate universal awareness is present)... the creativity of the neo-cortex is fully realised through an infinite current of energy\". No way is Dr Ilchi Lee putting an infinite current of energy through my neurons, but he can send me some of those cool brain-shaped gold vibrators off his website for only $90. They're top of my Christmas list. <p><b>\u00b7</b> So is there any peer-reviewed journal evidence to back up Brain Respiration? Yes! It's from the Korea Institute of Brain Sciences (proprietor Dr Ilchi Lee), and it's published in the American Journal of Chinese Medicine. It measured the EEG of children meditating (in the special brain respiration way), and found that meditating kids had EEG findings characteristic of meditation, when compared with a bunch of kids just sitting \"relaxing\" with some electrodes on their heads, presumably baffled, certainly not meditating, and therefore producing EEG recordings characteristic of kids sitting around in a room. Which goes to show the importance of choosing your control group carefully. There is another paper, which claims to show the effect of brain respiration on stress hormones, but it's only published in the Korea Institute of Brain Sciences journal, which, little surprise, isn't carried by my usual academic libraries. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Just to clarify: meditation is good, Herbert Benson's excellent papers on the Relaxation Response, the opposite of fight-or-flight, absolutely rule, and you miss out at your peril. But trademarked pseudoscientific nonsense meditation schools are bad, just like all the other backdoors to enlightenment. </p> <p><b> Please send your bad science to bad.science@theguardian.com</b></p>",
  "<p>They just won't learn. Two years after the disaster that was Swept Away, Madonna is going to act for husband Guy Ritchie in his next film.</p> <p>According to Ananova, the Material Girl is to play a crime boss in Revolver, a London-based gangster film - perhaps a return to surer grounds after forays in the holiday romance genre. </p> <p>She will play alongside Ritchie favourite Jason Statham and Goodfellas's Ray Liotta. Shooting starts this week in the capital.</p> <p>Swept Away, in which Madonna played a millionnaire wife stranded on a desert island with an Italian sailor, became one of the worst turkeys of the last decade when it failed to cash in at the US box-office following terrible reviews.</p> <p>The Guardian's John Patterson said at the time: \"Madonna's tan is the same colour as Shirley Eaton's suit of paint in Goldfinger. The light mines every fissure and crevice in a way that would have made Joan Crawford shoot her cameraman.\"</p> <p>The film went straight to video in the UK. Even Ritchie recognised that the film was not released \"because it's shit\".</p>",
  "<p>If your PC starts crashing or slows down, or suddenly starts taking you to strange web pages, don't just blame Microsoft: blame spyware. You have probably fallen victim to some malicious programs, which you might have agreed to download to visit a website (or to get away from one), or installed with free software that sounded useful. Even Bill Gates suffers from spyware on his home PC, and Microsoft is promising to help stamp it out. </p> <p>As the name suggests, spyware spies on where you go and what you do online. It can use this information to deluge you with adverts, or just clog up your PC. </p> <p>When Jeffrey Friedberg, Microsoft's director of Windows privacy, told the US government earlier this year that spyware is a growing threat, he blamed it for being \"at least partially responsible for approximately half the application crashes our customers report to us\". Gates thinks the industry is making headway against viruses but \"this malware thing is so bad; now that's the one that has us really needing to jump in\". Microsoft is planning to produce software to detect spyware, and to keep it up to date. This will not be easy, given the multiplying numbers of intrusive programs. </p> <p>In the US, legislators are planning to make spyware illegal, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is taking notorious spammer Sanford Wallace to court over spyware it alleges his websites were distributing. But just how much of a problem is it? </p> <p>According to Webroot, a software house that produces programs to find and remove spyware, the 3.2m PCs its tools have checked had an average of 26 bits of spyware installed. However, its measurements include third-party cookies from legitimate websites such as Guardian Unlimited, which don't cause PC problems and can be blocked by increasing your browser's privacy settings. Take those cookies away and it looks more like 18m infections than 83m - around six problem programs per PC. </p> <p>There is much confusion about what constitutes spyware and how it gets on to a PC, as well as some argument about how to deal with it. </p> <p>One approach is to tackle the people making money out of it. In the US, the FTC has asked the courts to shut down a series of websites that it says add insult to injury by infecting visitors with spyware ... and then selling them software that claims to remove it. \"Consumers don't deserve to be pestered and spied on by people who illegally hijack their computers,\" said Lydia Parnes, from the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. </p> <p>Long-time spam sufferers may remember the name of Wallace, once nicknamed Spamford. His company, CyberPromotions, was processing 30m spam emails a day when debts of $3m - mostly legal settlements from anti-spam lawsuits - forced it out of business in 1998. The FTC claims sites built by his new companies, Seismic Entertainment Productions and SmartBot, used security flaws in Internet Explorer to download and install spyware on visitors' PCs. </p> <p>The spyware changed their home page and search engine settings, installed yet more spyware, then triggered \"a barrage of pop-up ads\". Infected PCs slowed down or crashed. The spyware would open the PC's CD-Rom drive, then tell users that they needed to spend $30 on Spy Wiper or Spy Deleter software to clean up their system. These sales earned Seismic commissions. </p> <p>Ari Schwartz, associate director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, which complained to the FTC about the sites, calls it extortion. He says the government needs to be involved because it is often hard to find who is responsible for spyware. \"The government can gain access to records that can be blocked in a normal civil suit. That is important in a spyware case because there are so many parties involved,\" says Schwartz. \"Based on our research, we believed that Seismic was the centre of the chain here, but there are others involved. The FTC has the means to find out who.\" </p> <p>Wallace claims the sites didn't collect any information without asking permission, He dismisses the suit as a political move which, he says, is \"attempting to enforce federal laws that have yet to be enacted\". </p> <p>Last month, California passed a law banning spyware techniques such as logging what users type, changing security settings or sending unauthorised emails from PCs, but the US government is still working on a similar federal law, the Spy Act. </p> <p>Laws with teeth will make it easier to deal with the people who distribute spyware but, as with many security issues, the first steps need to be taken nearer to home. </p> <p>Most companies have security policies that should keep out spyware but, according to Symantec, less than 5% train their users on what that means in practice. The security improvements in Service Pack 2 for Windows XP go a long way towards protecting users, as long as they never say yes to a download without knowing what it is. </p> <p>However, in a recent US survey carried out by the National Cyber Security Alliance, 30% of people thought they were more likely to be struck by lightning, get audited by the tax man or win the lottery than run into security problems with their PCs. It is time to be a lot more suspicious online. </p> <p><strong>Links</strong><br> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/spyware\">www.microsoft.com/spyware</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/ \">www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/ </a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cdt.org/privacy/spyware/\">www.cdt.org/privacy/spyware/</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/\">www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Q</strong> Years ago our small family firm used solicitors to claim a bad debt from a client. Late in the proceedings we discovered that our solicitors had issued the claim under the wrong name and they told us to sue them, saying: \"Good firms always admit their mistakes and we are a good firm.\" </p> <p>They gave us the names of new solicitors to do this so we went to them and paid thousands of pounds only to be told by the judge that our claim was out of date and in addition we now have to pay the insurers' costs. </p> <p>The second solicitor then said, \"Sue us\" - so now not only have we lost the initial claim but two lots of solicitors costs and finally the insurers' costs which amount to around \u00a315,000 alone. </p> <p>I am appalled that we are expected to keep shelling out to these people for sheer incompetance. I cannot find anyone who I believe will look at this matter fairly because the lawyers seem to police themselves. I would welcome your thoughts on the matter and any advice you can offer.</p> <p><strong>JC</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Your experiences are a sad indictment of the legal profession in this country. Both firms of solicitors are unequivocally negligent for failing to reach the minimum professional standard. </p> <p>Any half-decent solicitor knows you must take care to issue proceedings against the correct defendant. And all lawyers should know that if you don't bring a claim within the time limits imposed by the Limitation Acts it will be thrown out.</p> <p>Unfortunately, your best chance of recouping your losses is to sue the second solicitor for professional negligence. And you will need to enlist the help of yet another solicitor to do this. However, since you have a very strong case you should get a solicitor to act for you on a \"no win no fee\" basis. </p> <p>Under this arrangement you pay an uplift of the usual fee if the solicitor wins the case but if you lose, you pay your solicitor nothing. You can also cover yourself against the risk of paying your opponent's costs if you lose the case by taking out relatively inexpensive insurance cover. </p> <p>Alternatively, you could put your claim to the <a href=\" http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/choosingandusing/redressscheme.law\">Law Society's consumer complaints service</a>, the help line number is 0845 608 6565. </p> <p>The Law Society can award up to \u00a35,000 compensation for complaints about poor service but they don't usually deal with claims for professional negligence.</p>",
  "An Indonesian cleric appeared in court today accused of leading the militant Islamist group responsible for a series of attacks including the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings that killed 202 people. <p>Prosecutors read out a 65-page indictment accusing Abu Bakr Bashir of running Jemaah Islamiyah, a south-east Asian terror network, and of using his \"religious charisma\" to incite followers to carry out attacks.</p> <p>The primary charge against Mr Bashir under the country's anti-terror legislation accuses him of planning the August 2003 suicide bombing of the Marriott hotel in Jakarta, in which 12 people died.</p> <p>A subsidiary charge accuses him of conspiring in the Bali attacks. The indictment alleges that Amrozi bin Nurhasyim, who was later convicted along with 35 other militants in the nightclub bombings, visited Mr Bashir three months before the attacks to ask for his blessing. </p> <p>Mr Bashir faces the death penalty if found guilty in the Marriott attack, or a long prison term if convicted of the Bali-related charges.</p> <p>Charges under the anti-terror law could not be brought against Mr Bashir in connection with the Bali bombings because Indonesia's highest court ruled the statute could not be used retroactively. The law was passed soon after the Bali attacks, in which many foreign tourists - mostly from Australia - were killed. </p> <p>Mr Bashir was not required to make a plea in today's hearing. The trial was adjourned until November 4, when his defence team will present their initial objections to the indictment. </p> <p>About 70 supporters of Mr Bashir shouted \"God is great\" as the 66-year-old cleric arrived at court wearing white robes and a prayer cap and flanked by armed anti-terror police. </p> <p>\"The charges are baseless. Everybody knows, even school children, that there is pressure from George Bush and his slave [the Australian prime minister] John Howard [to hold this trial]. All those people who do not agree with the interests of George Bush are called terrorists,\" he told reporters before the hearing.</p> <p>The trial, expected to last about five months, opened in a large auditorium in the agriculture ministry because of the high number of expected observers. </p> <p>In another trial last year, Mr Bashir was cleared of the terror charges but convicted of immigration violations. The verdict was criticised by the United States and Australia, which have led international calls for Jakarta to put him on trial again. </p> <p>He was re-arrested after completing his sentence in April, and has been in prison ever since. </p> <p>Mr Bashir has little active support in Indonesia, where radical Islam is not popular, but he has received sympathy from some mainstream clerics and government officials who view him as a victim of foreign intervention in the country's internal affairs.</p> <p>The cleric has long campaigned for the introduction of Islamic law in secular Indonesia. He fled to Malaysia in the 1980s to avoid arrest by then-dictator Suharto, who brutally repressed Islamist movements, and returned to Indonesia in 1998.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q</strong> On June this year I went into Holt Renfrew, Toronto and tried on a sample dress for my wedding. I later bought the dress for $4,594.25 on my Natwest Mastercard and arranged for it to be brought to me in London in August. </p> <p>When I received the dress, the cut was not like the sample I had tried so I telephoned the shop and at a staff members' suggestion, got my friend to return the dress which she did on September 7, but she didn't get a receipt. </p> <p>Then a member of staff called me and agreed to refund my money on to my credit card that evening and enclose a receipt in the post the following Monday. </p> <p>Two weeks later I called customer services at the shop and learned that no refund had been applied and my \"file\" was passed on to the assistant general manager for review. During these numerous phone calls I also learned that the dress I received was a standard size and if I wanted the look of the sample dress then I needed a special order. </p> <p>Meanwhile I have contacted Natwest Mastercard who informed me that if I had a receipt for the return of the dress or a letter stating that the company intended to refund my money they would be able in a position to assist with a refund on my credit card. As an alternative they suggested I wait until October 7 (deemed a \"reasonable time\") and if I hadn't received a refund, write detailing the events to their retail disputes department. </p> <p>Where do I legally stand? Am I entitled to a refund? And is there a mechanism I can employ to bring this about quickly? </p> <p><strong>BD</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> As you bought the dress in Toronto, Canadian Law governs your rights. The rules though, are very similar to those in England and Wales so you almost certainly have a claim against the shop for breach of contract on the basis that the dress did not correspond with its sample.</p> <p>But dealing with the shop will be costly and inconvenient so it makes sense to pursue your claim against Natwest Mastercard. Paying by credit card was a good move since this gives you additional rights, which are particularly useful when you buy goods abroad.</p> <p>Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 says the credit card company is equally responsible for the supplier's breach of contract if you use your card to buy goods costing \u00a3100 or more. So you have the same rights against the credit card company as against the dress shop.</p> <p>There is some doubt though about whether Section 75 applies when you shop abroad. But for many years the card companies have agreed to meet such claims on an ex gratia basis up to the amount of credit advanced. </p> <p>This means you can claim a refund of the cost of the dress from Natwest Mastercard with confidence. But you're unlikely to get any additional compensation for the inconvenience and distress you have suffered preparing for your wedding.</p>",
  "<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/glennreynolds/story/0,15140,1332330,00.html\">Last week's column</a> mentioned George Bush's \"Anglosphere-heavy coalition\". I think it's worth taking a moment to note the importance of the Anglosphere in today's world, and the deeper divisions it reflects. <p>Columnist James Bennett defines the \"Anglosphere\" <a href=\"http://www.pattern.com/bennettj-anglosphereprimer.html\">as follows</a>:</p> <p>\"This term, which can be defined briefly as the set of English-speaking, Common Law nations, implies far more than merely the sum of all persons who employ English as a first or second language. To be part of the Anglosphere requires adherence to the fundamental customs and values that form the core of English-speaking cultures. These include individualism, rule of law, honouring contracts and covenants, and the elevation of freedom to the first rank of political and cultural values.</p> <p>\"Nations comprising the Anglosphere share a common historical narrative in which the Magna Carta, the English and American Bills of Rights, and such Common Law principles as trial by jury, presumption of innocence, \"a man's home is his castle\", and \"a man's word is his bond\" are taken for granted. Thus persons or communities who happen to communicate or do business in English are not necessarily part of the Anglosphere, unless their cultural values have also been shaped by those values of the historical English-speaking civilisation.\"</p> <p>(Bennett also has a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=wwwviolentkicom&amp;path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2F0742533328%2Fqid%3D1098488246%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fv%3Dglance%26s%3Dbooks\">forthcoming book</a> on this topic.)</p> <p>I must confess that this construction struck me as odd at first. It's a bit too reminiscent of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter's theory that freedom was fundamentally a characteristic of the \"English-speaking peoples\", and faced far more uncertain prospects elsewhere. On the other hand, Jacques Chirac certainly seems to think there's something there, with his frequent <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3734512.stm\">outbursts</a> against \"a prevailing Anglo-Saxon culture which eclipses the others\".</p> <p>At any rate, it has been America's experience - and you can bet that plenty of Americans have noticed it - that when the chips are down it's usually other members of the Anglosphere, and particularly Britain and Australia, who can be counted on, and who are worth standing beside in turn. (Canada has been a bit dodgy in recent decades, ever since the Pierre Trudeau era and the Quebecois ascendancy). This is, of course, the reason why Tony Blair and John Howard wield such influence, while Chirac can barely get his calls returned. As <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,11102193%255E7583,00.html\">Mark Steyn</a> observes:</p> <p>\"The result is that, even though he's hardly ever in the souvenir photo line-up, Howard's a more consequential figure in world affairs these days than Chirac. Indeed, he's a transformative figure. I know this, because my nation has been on the other end of the transformation. I'm Canadian and, for those who remember when the Royal Canadian Navy was once the third largest surface fleet in the world, it's sobering to hear Australia spoken of as the third pillar of the Anglosphere.</p> <p>\"Under Howard, Australia is a player while Canada is a global irrelevance.\"</p> <p>France's problems go deeper, of course. Even within the European Union, it is described by some observers as <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/540606.html\">\"increasingly isolated\"</a> in opposition to the more dynamic nations of the East. But the extent to which French behaviour has forfeited American goodwill over the past few years is poorly appreciated among French leaders, I'm afraid. America would go to the mat to support Britain and Australia. But - though it has done so before, twice - I'm no longer sure that it would similarly exert itself on behalf of France. As <a href=\"http://www.travelbrochuregraphics.com/extra/anglosphere_sullivan.htm\">Andrew Sullivan</a> wrote in the Times last year: \"I've lived in the United States for almost 20 years and have rarely heard anything but condescension towards successive French governments. But now that condescension has turned to contempt.\"</p> <p>That seems about right to me. (There's even a new book, called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=wwwviolentkicom&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0385512198/qid%3D1096301707/sr%3D8-1\">Our Oldest Enemy</a>, that takes a rather unflattering view of France's role.) This is a bit of a problem for John Kerry, whose greater-than-average admiration for French policies has received some attention. And it's also a reason why Kerry, even if elected, will find it hard to take a more France-friendly approach. There just isn't political support.</p> <p>But though tensions between the United States and France are an issue, similar tensions exist within the United States, and around the world beyond France. As Bennett has <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20030412-013135-5601r\">observed:</a></p> <p>\"[I]t is worth considering the possibility that the root source of anti-Americanism in the world lies in the deep-rooted anti-modern tradition of Continental Europe.</p> <p>\"Just as the Ba'athist movement lately of Iraq and still in power in Syria is a localised variant of European fascism, the broader anti-Americanism currently fashionable on all continents comes ultimately from what some have called the industrial counter-revolution. This is a comprehensive category for the various reactions in Europe against the programme of the industrial and democratic revolutions, or liberalism in the classical sense - individualism, free markets, and technological and social progress.\"</p> <p>Osama bin Laden's rather backward-looking form of Islam constitutes an extreme reaction against modernity, of course. But the dirigiste statism of the traditional French approach, which has produced a political situation in which even modest adjustments to civil servants' pensions can produce widespread social unrest, is another, milder version.</p> <p>Nor is this purely a matter of international relations. Within the United States - and, indeed, within all countries, even the most capitalist - the industrial revolution, and capitalism, pose a threat to those who prefer hierarchy and status to dynamism and meritocracy. (Indeed, Virginia Postrel has looked at this division in her book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=wwwviolentkicom&amp;path=tg%2Fdetail%2F-%2F0684862697%2Fqid%3D1098489004%2Fsr%3D1-2%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fv%3Dglance%26s%3Dbooks\">The Future And Its Enemies,</a> and concluded that the big division of the twenty-first century is between \"dynamists\" and \"stasists\".)</p> <p>As both Bennett and Postrel note, the Anglosphere has been far more open to progress and change than, say, the Francosphere, such as it is. But within the Anglosphere one finds people - often academics, or government employees, or others who operate in environments where competition is less fierce, and status hierarchies more important - who are threatened by dynamism. In this regard, concerns about American power are as much a symptom of anxiety as a matter of substance. This may explain why so many such people around the world, and even within America, favour John Kerry, widely regarded as the <a href=\"http://daily.nysun.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Path=NYS/2004/03/15&amp;ID=Ar00104\">French-leaning</a> candidate in the American election. On the other hand, the division exists in the other direction, even on the Continent, too. Within France are activists like <a href=\"http://reason.com/0310/co.mw.liberty.shtml\">Sabine Herold,</a> who are challenging the ossified structures of French society and standing up against <a href=\"http://news.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/06/26/ftsab26.xml\">social rigidities.</a> (Herold, in a very un-French way, is an unabashed admirer of hard work.) And, of course, within Europe as a whole the countries of \"New Europe\", like Poland, are far more anxious for progress and change than the inward-looking countries of Old Europe, like France and Germany.</p> <p>The good news is that the American elections will be over soon. The bad news is that the tensions they represent are not limited to America, and will continue long after George Bush, or John Kerry, is sworn in in January.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Glenn Reynolds, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, runs the <a href=\"http://instapundit.com\">instapundit.com</a> US political blog.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Comment on this article <a href=\" http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives/us_elections/2004/10/explaining_the_anglosphere_.html\">here</a></p>",

Even if you may not have noticed it because it is not in the papers, we are quietly but surely taking on the yobs.</p> <p>Because we know what is happening in our communities, we were able to persuade the government to introduce the Antisocial Behaviour Act.</p> <p>Even though our opponents seemed to care more for the supposed rights of the perpetrators than the feelings of the victims (yes, especially you, Lib Dems), we have won tough parliamentary battles that have led to a real change of approach.</p> <p>Thanks to our efforts, antisocial behaviour orders are now a year old.</p> <p>We now have the trialling of fixed penalty notices for juveniles committing antisocial behaviour, and the prospect of parenting orders and residential parenting classes.</p> <p>We have police powers to disperse gangs of intimidating youngsters.</p> <p>We have a ban on the sale of spray paints to under-16s, denying access to the aerosols that so many youngsters have used to tag walls and street furniture.</p> <p>We have given some councils the power to remove graffiti from private property owned by the utilities so that, for example, cable boxes owned by firms like Telewest can't be left advertising the handiwork of our most prolific taggers.</p> <p>We have the introduction of continuous registration of cars so that people cannot simply dump old and unwanted cars, or leave them on the streets for sale.</p> <p>And we have powers for councils to check firms' waste removal contracts, so that unscrupulous businesses can no longer just dump their rubbish on the streets.</p> <p>Labour MPs who work hard in their constituencies know that people hate graffiti, litter, fly-tipping and abandoned cars. We know that they want meaningful punishment for people who commit antisocial behaviour. It is good that we have introduced these measures.</p> <p>But it remains frustrating that many of these powers are not yet in wide use, and that the authorities are still only learning about how they can make a difference.</p> <p>That is why backbench Labour MPs want the fight to continue.</p> <p>Ministers share our concerns. How could they not?</p> <p>In June, I found out that Hazel Blears, the crime minister, had a spare 30 minutes later that week, and persuaded her to meet some residents from Lavender Fields in Mitcham about antisocial behaviour.</p> <p>Lavender Fields may be the ward in my constituency with the lowest turnout at elections, but I phoned around, and even at a few hours notice, more than 50 people came.</p> <p>I also persuaded David Blunkett to meet some of the people who had contacted me about antisocial behaviour at the House of Commons. Even though the biggest meeting room in Westminster only holds about 150 people, we ended up with 400 travelling up to tell him he must do more to help beat the yobs.</p> <p>At meetings like these, people have been surprisingly reasonable. They know tackling antisocial behaviour is not easy, and they know we mean well. Although they may sometimes doubt that the police and local authorities will use the powers we have given them, they are pleased we are making a start.</p> <p>But they want more, and the message from many Labour MPs to the government is simple. The effect of antisocial behaviour on hardworking families in our communities can be devastating. According to a Populus survey in September, 76% of Labour voters told pollsters that the best way to persuade more people to vote for us would be action against crime and antisocial behaviour. </p> <p>As long as I am an MP, I intend to see that's what they get.</p> <p>I have spoken to other backbench MPs and we want David Blunkett to concentrate on ensuring new powers are actually used. But many of us also want him to introduce new measures that would take the fight against anti-social behaviour to another level. This is my shortlist.</p> <p><b>Extend \"police reassurance\" schemes</b><br> The government and mayor of London have already made many council wards \"police reassurance\" areas, with teams of police officers and community support officers patrolling local streets until 10pm. </p> <p>But 10pm can sometimes be the start time, rather than the finish, of a lot of anti-social behaviour, and I want the hours of operation to be based on residents' needs rather than what police managers want. </p> <p><b>A national alley-gater scheme</b><br> Some of the worst examples of fly-tipping and graffiti take place in alleyways behind houses. In Merton, pilot schemes to place gates across alley entrances have led to significant reductions in fly-tipping and also had an impact on burglary. They have proved popular with residents, who must all agree to them and put up some of the money themselves, with councils or voluntary groups paying the remainder. </p> <p>However, ancient rights of way or ownership rules can throw up obstacles, and legislation may be needed to ensure that cheap and effective initiatives like alley-gating can be made easier. </p> <p><b>Confiscation of Gopeds, Mopeds and Motorbikes being driven antisocially</b><br> This summer's number one issue in my constituency has been the gangs of young people who speed around our streets, parks and playing fields, uninsured, often without helmets or registration plates. They frighten pedestrians and other motorists, and are a danger not just to themselves but to smaller kids playing in the streets. But it has been the constant noise nuisance that has caused most complaints. </p> <p>The police do have powers to confiscate these bikes, but only in very limited and painfully unusual circumstances. I want to make it much easier. I also want the shops that sell gopeds to ensure they are not sold to under-16s, who are not old enough to drive them anyway. </p> <p><b>Make penalties more immediate and meaningful </b><br> When I was at school, I knew that if I did something wrong, I would be put in detention and might have to do some form of \"community service\". However, outside of school, there are no such sanctions. I want the principle of fixed penalty notices extended so that we can have fixed community service orders, so that, for instance, someone who is caught spray painting or dumping litter can be expected to take part in organised clean-ups in their area.</p> <p>I don't want this to just apply to children. We need to assure law-abiding constituents that if they report something those responsible will be punished. We also need to give police community support officers the powers to hand out these small punishments.</p> <p><b>Protection for people who report antisocial behaviour </b><br> At the moment, many people are afraid to report antisocial behaviour. In close-knit communities, neighbours may intimidate anyone who goes to the authorities. </p> <p>I am pleased that this week David Blunkett has said that victims will be protected, but I want to make sure this protection is meaningful and that the fear of being bullied by anti-social neighbours is absolutely eradicated.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Siobhain McDonagh is Labour MP for Mitcham and Morden.</p>",

  "The government's architecture watchdog is too eager to approve new developments at the expense of historic buildings, heritage groups warned MPs today. <p>In evidence to a select committee inquiry into the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment's role, the agency was also criticised by lawyers for exceeding its remit in the planning system.</p> <p>The written evidence to the committee published yesterday suggests that Cabe will get a rough ride when the inquiry's hearings begin on Monday. </p> <p>The inquiry by the select committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister comes at an awkward time for Cabe. It is still trying to recover from the departure of its founding chairman, the developer Sir Stuart Lipton, who was forced to resign last June after a government audit into conflicts of interest at Cabe.</p> <p>The conservation charity Save Britain's Heritage claimed that Cabe lacked expertise about historic buildings and was still too close to developers. </p> <p>Its evidence said: \"Cabe may think it exists to champion the new, but it needs to realise that its agenda must recognise the importance of context.\"</p> <p>It added: \"There is a real danger that the anti-heritage agenda which inevitably runs parallel to substantial commercial interest is unduly influencing the government's regeneration agenda, and is being reflected in Cabe's current attitude to the historic built environment.\"</p> <p>Cabe's influential design review panel is consulted on all major new developments. Save said the panel's record showed it was unsympathetic to the historic environment. It cited Cabe's intervention in a high profile dispute about an Edwardian arch at Paddington station. </p> <p>Save claimed the arch was \"integral\" to the Grade I listed building, but permission was granted for its demolition after Cabe described the arch as an unimportant \"pastiche\". </p> <p>It also expressed alarm at Cabe's involvement in plans to restructure the housing market in East Lancashire in a scheme that is likely to involve the demolition of several important rows of Victorian terraced houses.</p> <p>Another heritage group, the Bloomsbury conservation area advisory committee, accused Cabe of being \"irresponsible and unprofessional\" by offering support to developments before planning impact studies had been carried out. </p> <p>It also questioned whether Cabe had done enough to tackle potential conflicts of interest. \"It is doubtful whether the sole departure of Sir Stuart Lipton can restore public confidence in the probity of the organisation. There was no appreciation by the commission that anything was wrong following the publication of the audit report and Lipton's departure.\"</p> <p>In its evidence the Law Society pointed out to the committee that Cabe did not have the same formal role in the planning process as bodies like English Heritage, but that it acted as if it did. </p> <p>It said: \"Cabe has assumed a voice in the planning system beyond its original remit, often going to the press with its views in advance of meeting with developers and local authorities.\"</p> <p>It added: \"Matters of design are to a degree issues of subjective personal taste. It is unacceptable for one organisation, whatever its legal status, to interpose its views on development proposals.\"</p>",
  "<p>If a first novel's worth can be measured by the number of illustrious comparisons it receives, Tiffany Murray must know by now that she's written a winner: the gnarly mix of batty family, anti-Arcadian setting and zesty narrative voice in Happy Accidents, her colourful debut, has attracted more than its share of identifications. When Boyd Tonkin described it as \"Woody Allen visits Cold Comfort Farm\" in the Independent, he was by no means the only one to notice the resemblance; it has also been likened to Meera Syal's 1960s Herefordshire family saga Anita and Me, and Kate Atkinson's Whitbread award-winner, Behind the Scenes at the Museum. The one person who was entirely unaware of the novel's noble literary heritage, it seems, was the author herself. </p> <p>\"They were all books I first read this summer after comparisons were made with Happy Accidents - in an 'Anita and Me meets Cold Comfort Farm and brings along Behind the Scenes at the Museum for company' sort of way,\" she says, without a trace of all-my-own-work chippiness. \"It was lovely to see these links. Realising you have some sort of dialogue with other contemporary - or not so contemporary - literature is wonderful.\"</p> <p>Read Happy Accidents, and the roots of the comparisons are immediately obvious. In a coming-of-age tale seen through the eyes of 11-year-old Kate Happy, we are transported to soggy Herefordshire and the gothic clutter of Happy Farm, where the shadowy corridors \"smell of pee and beeswax\", the attic ghosts whisper and moan, and daily life is played out in front of a hotchpotch backdrop of menorahs, M&amp;S carrier bags, candlewick bedspreads and Toby jugs. Chaotic as the setting is, it's no more than a sort of inanimate Greek chorus for the residents themselves, the beyond-ironically-named Happy family. A cast of characters so dysfunctional they would make Emily Bronte proud, they range from the picturesque (Yankee Gran, goddamning everything and wading through farmyard muck in her pink suit and heels) to the grotesque (Aunt Reggie, so bent over by polio that she stares permanently at the ground and can't dislodge whichever of her flock of cats has jumped onto her hump). As Kate grows older and the story progresses, the mysteries that underpin the family's more extravagant bouts of eccentricity - the story behind Gran's friend Mathilda, for example, and why exactly Mum ran over Dad in her Triumph Spitfire - are unfolded, but not resolved. Life continues - though not, perhaps, as normal. </p> <p>The book's off-key bucolic setting made comparisons with Cold Comfort Farm inevitable, but from the very first page, when we discover Kate lying bare-bottomed on a red chaise-longue waiting to have a boil raised, the parallels with Behind the Scenes at the Museum and its imperturbable young narrator Ruby are far more evident. </p> <p>\"Ruby Lennox is a more sophisticated mouthpiece for her family's stories than my own Kate Happy, but I must admit that as Atkinson's menagerie of pets, vampires, dead sisters, ghosts and tales of family members buried by war and marriage tumbled out of Behind the Scenes, I was astounded at the echo,\" Murray agrees. \"I think it's simply because both Atkinson's novel and my own are trying to tell a story with a chorus of voices from the last century; characters that have been blighted by two world wars, an antiseptic 1950s and a wonderfully septic 1960s, with a child narrator at the centre trying to fit into this family chorus. The important thing, I think, is that Happy Accidents rings bells in readers' minds, in their memories; that's really quite nice.\" </p> <p>If Murray was unaware of the first set of bells the novel rings, she rang the second herself, with all the vigour of a campanologist. Happy Accidents thrums with references to other books, from Wuthering Heights to The Water Babies and Nancy Drew, both explicitly when Kate makes mention of them and implicitly through their echoes in Murray's own plot and characters. </p> <p>\"This is where I had a fully intended dialogue with other books, and books I loved as a child,\" Murray nods. \"When I began to write Happy Accidents I made a point of revisiting them - I actually took a ladder and hauled them down from the attic. Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, Salem's Lot, The Water Babies, The Secret Garden, Little Women, Nancy Drew, Stig of the Dump ... they all got an airing. Kate herself is part Mary Lennox, part Nancy Drew, part Jo March, part Tom the chimney sweep ... or at least, as we all did, she wishes to be. I also wanted to twist the tales slightly - so, in Kate's dream, Jane Eyre and Mr Barlow, the head vampire from Salem's Lot, buy offal and chocolate liqueurs on their weekly shop, and Brian [the farmhand and Kate's on-off boyfriend] is a sexually mature Dickon who shows Kate his nether parts in a damp and dirty barn rather than leverets and crocus bulbs in the lovely secret garden. Going back to these books and writing them in, however skewed, allowed me to capture the feeling of childhood. To nod to those stories that were the fabric of my past and will forever mould my perception was a thrill.\"</p> <p>The blurring of boundaries between Kate's own story and those from remembered books deepens the sense of liminality that unlies the book. On the edge of England, where the \"land spills into Wales\", Herefordshire is a frontier sort of place, and Kate's a frontier story. When the novel opens, we see her balanced on many thresholds - between childhood and adulthood, England and America, lesbianism and heterosexuality, past and present - but as the action develops, all her worlds crash together and jumble up. Postcards, letters and telegrams from the past punctuate the present; the Old World and the New (in the forms of her Aunts Reggie and Rita) set up opposing camps in the farmhouse, and Kate divides her first forays into sex between Brian the farmhand and her best friend Jamilah. Gran, whose neurotic food rules (no breakfast, hot water instead of soup for supper) may reflect her desire to keep Kate just as she is forever, extols the benefits of living on the edge (\"Don't forget honey, the cusp is the best place to be\"), but time continues to pass and the situation becomes untenable. By the end of the novel, Kate has made the inevitable choice to step over the threshold and decide which of the worlds she wants to inhabit. In the final chapter she and Gran return to Gran's native Coney Island, where \"the house smells better than beeswax and pee\" and because, as Gran says, \"'We're starting fresh, honey,'\" the only thing they take with them is the ashes of their dead relatives. </p> <p>\"I love the final chapter, that sense of relief and light and space,\" Murray says. \"I do wonder whether, in a year's time, 4342 Oceanview Avenue would have towers of scrapbooks and photograph albums shooting up from the white, bright floors, blocking out the sun from the windows - but I think that in the moment that the novel ends, there is a sense of hope, a shedding of baggage, a setting-free of things in the Coney Island breeze. It's a springboard, a threshold, the stage from which Kate's coming of age can now leap.\"</p> <p> Like many a first-time novelist, however, Murray is rather more tentative in response to specific questions about the theme of liminality and how actively she set about establishing it within the story.</p> <p>\"Because character always comes first for me, all the threads and issues simply rise from these various lives,\" she says, carefully. \"Perhaps it's only in the second sitting that you become fully aware of the links and themes criss-crossing your work. I think that's the main joy as a writer, to return to your own book as a reader and see that this small, local, subjective world has universal significance. It's not always easy to achieve but it is an obvious point - if you want to create a fictional world authentically it simply has to have layers, implicit or not.\"</p> <p>Difficult it may be, but despite this - and the fact that she described the process of creating her first novel as \"six years in a social vacuum\" - Murray is writing again. This time, in a novel called Rockfield, she has turned her gaze on a recording studio in Wales in the early 1980s. \"It is narrated by Diamond Star Halo, or as she prefers, Anne,\" Murray explains. \"Again, I'm playing with talking back to my favourite books, this time from adolescence: Persuasion and I Capture the Castle.\" With influences like these the comparisons will no doubt come flooding in again - but if Happy Accidents is anything to go by, it won't be long before reviewers start turning to Tiffany Murray's books when they're in search of a yardstick. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Buy Happy Accidents by Tiffany Murray at the Guardian Bookshop with free UK P&amp;P <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=0007183666\">here</a></p>",
  "Primary schoolchildren in England and Wales are being served school dinners containing much higher levels of fat, sugar and salt than nutritionists recommend, according to a detailed analysis of the meals. <p>The government was accused of hypocrisy yesterday by the Soil Association, the organic food pressure group, after it urged food manufacturers and supermarkets to reduce salt while failing to impose the same standards on school meals. </p> <p>A nutritional analysis commissioned by the association of five meals typically served in primary schools, showed that children eating them over five days would consume 40% more fat, 28% more saturated fat and 20% more sugar than recommended. </p> <p>They would also miss out on some nutrients, receiving just 80% of the amount of iron needed and 70% of the recommended level of zinc. </p> <p>The association, one of a number of voices urging higher quality school meals to improve health and reduce child obesity, analysed typical primary school meals such as a cheese fritter, peas, roast potatoes and flapjack or a fishy shape, spaghetti hoops, smiley faces and an iced bun. </p> <p>It compared the results with nutritional guidelines for children aged seven to 10 set by the Caroline Walker Trust, which campaigns to improve public health through good food and says school dinners should provide on average a third of a child's recommended daily intake of nutrients. The association then came up with its own meal recommendations. </p> <p>Despite government pledges to improve school meals, the guidelines for primary school dinners do not limit the amounts of fat, sugar and salt which can be served or set any levels for beneficial vitamins and minerals. </p> <p>Last month Charles Clarke, the education secretary, unveiled a national healthy living blueprint, and pledged to review nutritional standards for secondary school meals, set in 2001. </p> <p>The Department for Education and Skills said it planned to conduct research into the quality of primary school food before introducing any changes. </p> <p>Peter Melchett, the Soil Association's policy director, described the decision to delay action as \"a scandal\". </p> <p>He said: \"The government accepts that it is risking the health of young and vulnerable children by allowing meals that are high in fat, sugar and salt at school. It is well known that most school dinners in primary schools do not provide the correct level of nutrients ... but still Charles Clarke refuses to act to protect children at their most crucial stage of development.\" </p> <p>Campaigners said nursery and primary school age is the period during which children's eating habits could be set for life and called on the government to use its ability to control their diet through school meals. \"This is an area where the government is nanny,\" Mr Melchett said. </p> <p>The confirmation that primary school meals fall below recommended nutritional standards came as the government is calling on food manufacturers and supermarkets to produce plans to reduce the salt, sugar and fat in their products. </p> <p>A government-backed campaign featuring Sid the Slug is urging the public to cut down on salt or risk raised blood pressure and heart attacks. \"It is two-faced and hypocritical,\" Mr Melchett said, urging the government to \"put its own house in order before putting pressure on others to deliver.\" </p> <p>In 2000, the government's National Diet and Nutrient Survey, found that 94% of seven- to 10-year-olds consumed more saturated fat than recommended. More than 75% did not consume enough zinc - vital to help produce new cells and enzymes and process carbohydrate, fat and protein - and 59% of girls got too little iron. </p> <p>Campaigners said a shift to mainly unprocessed food was possible in schools, pointing to Scotland, where an overhaul of school dinners has been a success, and to some local authorities and schools going it alone in England. </p> <p>The DfES said yesterday it was moving to address the issue of primary school meals. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"We are setting up an expert steering group, made up of representatives from schools, local authorities, the catering industry and nutritionists to see how guidelines can be tightened up to further reduce salt, sugar and saturated fats in children's diets. </p> <p>\"We are also undertaking a specific monitoring and evaluation exercise on the quality of primary school meals. </p> <p>\"We have set down the minimum standards for school lunches, but they are just that, a minimum. Many schools have been innovative in their provision and contracting and are providing extremely healthy and nutritious meals.\"</p>",
  "<b>Troops in Iraq</b> <br> British troops may be needed to replace the Black Watch when they return from assisting US marines in Iraq before Christmas, the prime minister indicated. \"We don't believe there will be a further requirement for other troops. But I can't ... guarantee that\", he told the Commons. <p><b>Defence spending</b><br> The prime minister denied that overall numbers in the armed forces were going to fall under government reforms. The Tory leader, Michael Howard, said the chief of the general staff had stated that army numbers were falling from more than 108,000 to 102,000. </p> <p>In a \"dangerous world,\" Britain needed stronger forces and a prime minister who gave \"straight answers\" but the country currently had neither, Mr Howard insisted. Mr Blair said it was correct the number of battalions was being cut from 40 to 36 but added: \"Overall, the numbers of people in our armed forces is not going to be reduced.\" </p> <p><b>Gambling bill</b><br> Allowing dozens of Las Vegas-style casino complexes to be built in Britain would bring multi-million pound investment and thousands of jobs to deprived areas, Mr Blair said. Facing backbench anger over proposals in the gambling bill, the prime minister insisted that 90% of the legislation was measures to tighten up gambling laws. </p> <p>He told MPs: \"It will allow, as well as better regulating gambling, some of these large leisure casino complexes, probably 20 to 40, in areas that will be regenerated with hundreds of millions of pounds of investment and thousands of jobs.\" But Labour's David Winnick told him: \"The last thing we want is a casino-type society. I really do think ministers should reconsider the whole matter.\" </p> <p><b>EU constitution</b><br> The proposed European constitution is \"a sensible deal for this country\", Mr Blair insisted after a former senior aide called for a \"no\" vote. Mr Howard taunted the prime minister over remarks by Derek Scott that his former boss had been \"gutless\" for accepting the proposals. Mr Blair retorted that \"a true leader would stand up to the UK Independence party not run from them\". </p> <p><b>Murder law</b><br> As the domestic violence, crime and victims bill completed its Commons stages, the home secretary, David Blunkett, announced that a review of murder law would begin next year. He said: \"The bill has highlighted a real issue with the way the partial defence to murder of provocation works. The Home Office will lead a review into murder as part of the government's commitment to protect victims and bring their abusers to justice.\" </p> <p>The bill, which aims to increase the protection, support and rights of victims and witnesses, uses \u00a34m from the proceeds of crime to set up a victims' fund. It creates a new offence of \"familial homicide\" for causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable adult. </p> <p>Later, the Tories reacted with anger when Mr Blunkett blamed them for the fact that he was ultimately unable to make his expected announcement on murder law. His prepared words, released earlier via a press release, were never delivered to the house because a series of votes on amendments used up the remaining time for debate. The home secretary accused the opposition of \"filibustering\". </p> <p><b>Blair's record</b><br> Mr Blair defended his record as Labour leader after being challenged by one of his backbenchers, Gordon Prentice, to name a single \"dramatic act of renewal\" he had overseen. The prime minister said: \"I can think of several - quite apart from the fact that we've had two successive Labour governments.\" He spoke of economic stability, two million more jobs, a minimum wage, record investment in health and education and half a million children lifted out of poverty. \"That's some renewal. Maybe you should go back and tell your constituents.\" </p> <p><b>Diego Garcia</b><br> Providing state help for families exiled from Diego Garcia would open the floodgates to many other such claims, Mr Blair said. He was responding to Tory Chris Grayling, who said his constituents were having to pay to house the new arrivals and claimed \"thousands\" more could be on the way. </p> <p><b>Smacking</b><br> Mr Blair came under pressure to allow MPs a free vote on moves to ban smacking. Challenged by Labour's Hilton Dawson, the prime minister gave no specific commitment. He suggested a \"commonsense way through\" was possible and parental instincts might be better than those of politicians. </p> <p><b>Internet dialling scams</b><br> The prime minister was stumped for an answer when tackled on internet dialling scams which have racked up bills of hundreds of pounds for unassuming phone users. Challenged by Labour's Chris Mole, Mr Blair said he would have to consult with the trade and industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, on an issue which was clearly of \"deep concern\". </p> <p><b>Hunting</b><br> Ministers were again defeated over foxhunting when the Lords voted to back tests of \"utility and least suffering\" for registered hunts. The move by Tory Lord Mancroft was carried by 194 to 57 during the hunting bill's committee stage. It comes after Tuesday's vote to allow regulation of the sport instead of the outright ban demanded by the Commons. Junior environment minister Lord Whitty warned the amendment would be unacceptable to MPs. </p> <p><b>Omagh bombing</b><br> The government came under pressure over the whereabouts of Paddy Dixon, a key Real IRA informant who allegedly knew about the Omagh bomb plot. Tory Laurence Robertson demanded: \"Can you explain why the Irish Republic refused to hand over Paddy Dixon who was wanted in connection with questioning with the Omagh bombing? Can you also tell me if Paddy Dixon has been relocated to the United Kingdom, because recently he was stopped in Cardiff by the authorities.\" </p> <p>Junior Northern Ireland minister Ian Pearson replied: \"There is a good strong level of cooperation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Siochana on a wide level of issues, certainly including dealing with paramilitaries and dealing with the issue of organised criminal activity.\" </p> <p><b>EU commission</b><br> Former Conservative home secretary Lord Waddington sprang to the defence of Mr Rocco Buttiglione, the proposed European commissioner whose views on homosexuality and women have plunged the EU parliament into crisis. He said: \"There is a world of difference between believing that homosexual acts are wrong and being determined to discriminate against a person on the grounds of his sexual orientation.\" </p> <p>Foreign Office minister Lady Symons said: \"The sensible position now is to allow time for reflection, negotiation and discussion and hope to come to a reasonable conclusion.\" </p> <p><b>Equatorial Guinea</b><br> Britain has been approached by the government of Equatorial Guinea over investigations into the alleged failed coup attempt in March last year, Lady Symons confirmed. She said: \"We have made clear to the Equatorial Guinean government that any evidence they may have relating to activities of persons currently in the UK, which might contravene UK law should be passed to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service.\" </p> <p><b>Footballers' behaviour</b><br> Misbehaviour by footballers like David Beckham and top managers should be tackled with anti-social behaviour orders, Liberal Democrat Lord Dholakia suggested. He cited the fracas at Manchester United's Old Trafford ground and actions of United and Arsenal managers Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger. Lord Bassam, for the government, said its strategy in combating football-related disorder was proving successful. </p> <p><b>St George's Day</b><br> The St George's Day (public holiday) bill failed to gain its first reading by 112 votes to 83. Tory Andrew Rosindell had said it would allow people to celebrate \"the true spirit of England\" on the day, April 23. It was opposed by Labour's John Cryer who said it intended to replace the traditional May Day bank holiday. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>The education secretary, Charles Clarke, and his ministers and the solicitor general, Harriet Harman, face the Commons at question time. The school transport bill is set to gain its second reading. The Lords debates the hunting bill's committee stage and women in prisons.</p>",
  "<p>Freshly killed, bloodied, young male bodies, laid out in neat rows where they died ... the slaughter of nearly 50 recruits to the Iraqi army, shown on the weekend news bulletins, was by no means the worst image to have come out of the war there. Children's mutilated bodies; the beheading videos; close-up shots of the aftermath of a car bomb - in the abattoir of politics there is plenty to choose from. And yet, most of the time, we are protected from actually seeing the worst. This time, sitting on the sofa watching the news, the shock was strong and lasted for days. </p> <p>Did we need to see the bodies? Did it help us to understand the reality of what is happening out there? Or did it merely coarsen us further, making us less easily shocked? Or, strangely, a bit of both? This is the same argument that was had in scores of broadcasters' offices and newspaper newsrooms about the harrowing images of Ken Bigley and the other murdered captives. </p> <p>It is the argument that raged during the IRA years, or when explicit film came back from Vietnam, Israel and the Balkans; when news crews reached the worst sights in Rwanda or Ethiopia; when in the first Iraq war, Saddam's soldiers were burned alive by US jets. But just because an argument has gone on before, doesn't mean it is outdated or resolved. This one is becoming more urgent, not less. </p> <p>And as for death, so for sex. The film Nine Songs has been widely described as the most sexually explicit film given a licence for mainstream British cinemas. It not only shows the occasional act of fellatio or ejaculation in the course of a story, as with previous causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres, such as Last Tango in Paris; this film is apparently about nothing else. Its director Michael Winterbottom says that cinema has been prudish: \"I wanted to go to the opposite extreme and show a relationship only through sex.\" Further, these are not simulated sex acts. They are all real. </p> <p>If an individual scene of slaughter in Iraq, or an individual film getting an 18 certificate, causes a bit of a media row, then it's not a big one, simply because the \"background noise\" of sex and violence is already turned up so high. From Tarantino's blade-wielding maidens to hot lesbian action in our mundane soap operas, from the extreme digital gore of modern computer games, to widespread nudity on telly, we are fed a diet of images which would have had earlier generations gaping, unable to believe their eyes. </p> <p>We have come to accept that. Most teenage boys I know found Kill Bill merely funny. As for sex, children not even into their teens see things on the telly which would have had earlier generations of adults rushing for the off button, writing furious letters to their MP as they did so. </p> <p>What makes these recent examples different from the old argument about censorship? First, we are talking about acts which were real, not faked. Second, we are talking about a greater availability of images - the new democracy of moving pictures. There have been sex films for as long as there have been films. But the geographic isolation of porn cinemas, in red light areas, kept them furtive and away from most people's lives. And there have been images of war, first still images and then moving ones. But in the past decisions about censorship were made by professionals, editors and managers, working inside the news industry. </p> <p>Our vastly more open media world, led by the internet, changes all that. Hardcore is instantly available, including child porn. Whatever you want, if you want to see the real thing, it is probably out there, waiting for your click. There are scores of sites showing the beheading videos. Easy-to-use digital images have ripped the initiative away from news professionals. Whether you are an Islamist terrorist keen to spread fear and horror, or whether you are an uneasy, or boastful, American soldier photographing scenes from Abu Ghraib with a mobile phone and emailing them, the old barriers to broadcasting have come crashing down. </p> <p>And this is true even in the mainstream of modern broadcasting. The BBC, or CNN, can decide not to show certain images. But the burgeoning Arab TV stations are spilling them out across the Middle East anyway. Even in Russia, a comparatively tightly controlled society, Putin was unable to stop his citizens seeing the reality of the Beslan school massacre. The old media monopoly is as dead as the old monopoly on nuclear know-how. </p> <p>This, in turn, produces a new kind of media-political debate. Mary Whitehouse's world has been destroyed not simply by porn and liberal values, but by technology. Campaigns to get governments to ban things are increasingly beside the point. At the very extremes, as with paedophile porn, governments can still work together, limit the damage and arrest its makers. But in restraining images of mere explicit sex and explicit violence, the power of individual states has gone. </p> <p>It does not mean that mainstream broadcasters simply give up, and show whatever pictures they can lay their hands on. If the political motivation is to disgust and terrorise, the broadcasters don't have to oblige. We know what happened to Mr Bigley. We don't need to watch it. The human imagination is flexible enough. Sometimes we do need to see images of massacres to remind us of the dreadful reality of what is happening in, say, Iraq; but every image lessens the power of the next. </p> <p>The same is true of sex. After decades of trying to find the next titillating sex story, the tabloids now find it impossible to shock us. Their sales are falling and there's no way back. So there are interesting and difficult commercial decisions: sliding downhill into gormless explicitness is not a universal route to success. </p> <p>In the main, though, the onus is back on us, as individuals. We have the \"freedom\" to see all the intimacies and horrors of the world; the question is, how do we use it? There are signs of hope. Internet chatroom debates among apparently young and media savvy people about whether to watch the beheading videos, are interesting for the general hostility to the idea. People who have watched them, out of curiosity and ghoulishness - the same motives as among the crowds at public executions in the past - express regret and sorrow. The notion that porn cheapens human relationships is accepted on the left, as well as the right. </p> <p>Rather than ban, we can look away. We have to recapture the language of individual restraint and decency. We need to recall that the power of disapproval, and shame, can be stronger than the power of the state. The freedom to watch is also the freedom not to watch. Pictures and images may be everywhere, but they are only two-dimensional. We may see, but we don't necessarily feel. Feelings depend on more than just images: on words, arguments and values. We don't need to hurry along to Nine Songs, or to click on the grim sites. And we are better people when we don't. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",

That process has been dominated by machismo. Post-9/11 America has put tough leadership at the centre of the election debate. </p> <p>As long ago as May 2003, when Bush was photographed in full helicopter pilot garb declaring an end to fighting in Iraq on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln, the intention was clear. He was tough, he was in command; he was also premature. </p> <p>In fact, Kerry's campaign has made more use of such images than Bush's. His team has tried to create a patriotic and heroic appeal by playing on their man's military record in Vietnam. </p> <p>But consumers - or voters - buy brands with which they most closely identify. Hence, a rush of photocalls intended to portray both candidates as regular American guys. The reality is that both come from privileged backgrounds light years from most of the voters whose support they court. But that's why Bush hunts, fishes and plays golf; it's why Kerry has ridden a Harley, played ice hockey and piloted a plane. It's why Bush wears rugged outdoor clothing and why Kerry sometimes looks like an extra from a Gap ad. </p> <p>In pure marketing terms, Bush has had the better of things. His proposition is simple: security, decisiveness and patriotism wrapped up in homespun Texan humour. Kerry has failed to create a brand that can be distilled into such populist terms.

  "<p>Fathers should spend more time alone with their children in order to strengthen relationships and help ensure bonds are not broken if parents split up, the minister charged with easing the pain of custody battles said yesterday. </p> <p>In his first interview since moving to the education department last month as children and families minister, Lord Filkin told the Guardian that forthcoming government reforms to help divorcing parents resolve child contact disputes without prolonged court battles would help more separated fathers see more of their children. </p> <p>But the minister, himself a divorced father of three, said he had not been swayed by the high-profile protests of the Fathers4Justice campaign group, which he called \"extreme\", nor the lobbying of the singer Bob Geldof, who has secured several meetings with ministers. But he did concede that the government's voice had been drowned out in recent months by fathers' rights campaigners. </p> <p>Some fathers had been too \"wet\" about persisting in seeking contact with their children if first knocked back, he said. </p> <p>Lord Filkin, whose ministerial brief covers the areas in which the state touches most closely on family life, said fathers now enjoyed a far closer relationship with their children than they had 30 years ago. </p> <p>But, he said, there was \"plenty of scope for fathers to do more\", and particularly to enjoy time spent alone with their children. \"Many of us would say that time by yourself [with children] is a rich experience.\" </p> <p>While the state should not \"tell parents what they should do\", he said children wanted to feel that both parents were involved in their lives. For fathers, \"it could be the usual stuff, going to the school open day, but it's also cooking a meal occasionally or taking them on an outing by themselves. Kids like that.\" </p> <p>Fathers' involvement lightened the load of parenting, and helped ease the situation if relationships broke down, he said. Divorced mothers were sometimes reluctant to hand over children to their fathers as part of contact agreements because \"they are worried about whether he can hack it - does he really know how to change a nappy? ... That has been one of the causes of the problems about contact.\" </p> <p>A green paper published by the government in July and currently out to consultation sets out a range of measures intended to ease the plight of separating parents. There is widespread concern among parents, lawyers and campaigners that the present system, in which one in ten cases goes to court, is drawn out, inefficient, and increases the suffering of children and parents alike. </p> <p><strong>Parenting plans</strong><br> </p> <p>Central to the proposals is a significantly increased emphasis on mediation in place of going to court, with more help and advice for parents. The green paper suggests the introduction of parenting plans - \"templates\" to help resolve disputes, showing how parents in similar situations have reached workable agreements on child contact. </p> <p>The package does not, however, include guaranteed rights to equal contact for both parents - the so-called 50:50 split advocated by Fathers4Justice and by Geldof in a recent Channel 4 broadside, and backed by the Conservatives. </p> <p>The option had been rejected, Lord Filkin said, because \"to say that 50:50 should be central thrust of policy is to put the interests of parents at the centre of the debate, rather than the interests of the child.\" </p> <p>As well as not always being best for the child, a half-and-half division of time would in many cases not be workable, he said. </p> <p>The government argues that men already have an equal right in law \"to have responsibility for, and a meaningful relationship with, their children, so long as it is safe\". </p> <p>A process of mediation, rather than an imposed court decision, would also help change parents' behaviour to allow them to make contact arrangements work, said Lord Filkin, who launched the review of the issue last autumn while in his former role at the department of constitutional affairs. </p> <p><strong>Damage</strong><br> </p> <p>The fact of parental separation was less harmful to children than witnessing bitter arguments, he said. \"Parental separation is upsetting for children, but it is not long-term damaging; it is the conflict that is damaging. </p> <p>\"If parents keep on and on rowing, or one parent is rubbishing the other, that really is damaging to the child - and there is evidence to support that. So we have to find better ways of making the system work, so it is more likely to make more agreements workable in the interests of the child.\" </p> <p>For those parents who do not abide by the arrangements, there are proposals for tougher enforcement, including community service orders. This is an element of the green paper that Lord Filkin pledges is beyond consultation. </p> <p>However, figures suggest that the number of mothers withholding access is far lower than Fathers4Justice suggests: only 2% of separated fathers return to court because their ex-partner has frustrated a contact order, and twice as many parents with residence (mainly mothers) as separated fathers wanted their partner's contact with children to increase. </p> <p>Fathers had too often opted to disappear under the current system, he said. \"If some fathers disappear because they make a bit of a half-hearted attempt to get contact and then get the brush-off, that's sad, and it is a bit wet as well. </p> <p>\"We really hope there will be less of that, because it's really important that fathers recognise how important they are to their kids.\" </p> <p>Though reluctant to discuss his own family life - he was married to the former parliamentary standards commissioner Elizabeth Filkin - the families minister concedes that his experience helps him understand the pain of divorced parents more acutely. </p> <p>\"With some things in life, when you have them happen to you, you don't need to empathise to understand them - you just need memory. </p> <p>\"I don't have to imagine what it feels like for parents.\"</p>",
  "<p>The UK has increased the amount of carbon dioxide it wants power plants and factories to be able to pump out under a new European Union regime covering greenhouse gas emissions. </p> <p>It has set tougher emission reduction targets but only after raising its estimate of the amount of CO2 that would have been pumped out over the next three years without the changes. </p> <p>The revised regime will mean British firms will be able to emit slightly less than 3% more CO2 than would have been allowed under the government's original calculations, announced in April. </p> <p>Margaret Beckett, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, said the proposals were \"good news for tackling climate change\". </p> <p>\"We are balancing the need to protect the competitive position of UK industry while moving us beyond our Kyoto protocol commitment towards our tougher national goal.\" </p> <p>But the new allocations immediately came under fire. Bryony Worthington, from Friends of the Earth, said the government had to realise \"the policies we have in place are not bringing emissions under control\". Yesterday's announcement showed \"a typical lack of political will\" and was bad news for Britain's efforts to meet the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 20% of 1990 levels by 2010. </p> <p>Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker said the changes showed that the prime minister \"always takes the side of the polluters, never the side of the environment\". </p> <p>The allocations are part of an EU-wide move to set up a trading scheme designed to rein in pollution levels. </p> <p>Countries will be allocated overall emission levels which will then be divided between individual sectors. Firms that generate fewer greenhouse gases will be able to \"sell\" the shortfall to those that have emitted more than allowed. </p> <p>In April the government said it expected CO2 emissions from UK installations covered by the scheme to be 736.3m tonnes on a \"business as usual\" basis - that is, without emission-cutting measures - and that it was planning a 0.7% reduction in the total. </p> <p>Yesterday the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it expected the \"business as usual\" emission level would be 792.4m tonnes and that it would be seeking a 5.2% reduction. </p> <p>That would bring the new target to 756.1m tonnes - slightly less than 3% more than the original figure. </p> <p>Mrs Beckett said yesterday the April numbers had been \"an early stab\" and that it had always been made clear they were subject to a number of caveats and that much more work would be needed. To have pressed ahead on the basis of the original numbers would have had a \"devastating\" effect on industry. </p> <p>Mrs Beckett said the new figures were an amendment to Britain's original submission to the EU and so would not require a three-month scrutiny by Brussels which could upset the expected timetable for the start of emissions trading. </p> <p>The new regime is scheduled to come into operation at the beginning of next year, with trading starting in March. </p> <p>The CBI, the employers' organisation, said it was essential that Brussels approved the UK's revised figures. </p> <p>\"Without the extra headroom, business would not be able to cope with the more ambitious targets which result from the increased projections for emissions announced today. Frankly, the government's earlier figures were wrong.\" </p> <p>Guy Thompson, the director of thinktank Green Alliance, said yesterday there was \"still all to play for\" if the government was to achieve its long-term aims: \"It does not matter how we present the UK's position, its standing in relation to other EU member states. </p> <p>\"The thing we have to consider is to deliver our 2010 carbon reduction target. It's not clear to me how this announcement today will help us further down that route.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government is set to clear the way for the use of open source software on hundreds of thousands of government desktops - but plans to keep the door open to Microsoft, too. The announcement, the first significant shift in policy on open source for more than two years, is likely to follow the publication of results from trials showing that \"free\" software works and saves money. </p> <p>However, the new policy is unlikely to quell critics of the close relationship between Microsoft and the British government, its largest customer outside the US. Microsoft, meanwhile, will continue to argue that its software works out cheaper than \"free\" programs when measured by total cost of ownership. </p> <p>The Treasury's Office of Government Commerce (OGC), set up to get better value from government procurements, will today announce that open source is a \"viable desktop alternative for the majority of users\" and that it can generate \"significant savings\". Interoperability with other systems is \"not now a major issue\". The report also found potential \"green\" benefits because open source software can prolong the life of computer hardware. </p> <p>The announcement is significant because open source had previously been seen as an option only for consolidating servers and other \"back-room\" systems. </p> <p>The pilots, carried out with IBM and Sun, two firms committed to open source systems, tested technology in central government departments such as the Cabinet Office and other organisations including central Scottish police. They were conceived following lobbying by the open source industry, which says that the UK government lags behind commercial firms and other European administrations in picking open source. </p> <p>Steve Brown, head of Novell's UK operations, estimates that open source has about 20% of the commercial software market, but only 1% of the government market. </p> <p>Although the OGC report backs up many of the claims of open source enthusiasts, the UK is unlikely to follow some others and announce a strategic preference for open source. The OGC says: \"Decisions should be based on a holistic assessment offuture needs, taking into account total cost of ownership, with proper consideration of both proprietary and open source solutions.\" </p> <p>The Office of the Head of e-Government is likely to include this advice in a new policy statement to be published shortly. This updates a previous policy, dating from July 2002, which merely says that IT procurements \"should consider\" open source solutions alongside proprietary ones and that the government should avoid getting locked in to proprietary standards. </p> <p>Whitehall is likely to use the new policy as a stick to negotiate better deals from Microsoft, which is expected to sign a new three-year discount deal across the government. </p> <p>The cause of open source software in government has received two setbacks this year. Last summer, the London borough of Newham announced a partnership with Microsoft after testing open source. Its decision was based on a study, funded by Microsoft, of the \"total cost of ownership\". Meanwhile, the borough of Rossendale in Lancashire decided not to pursue a migration to open source, despite the offer of funding from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. </p> <p>However, some authorities have recently announced moves to open source. In the biggest switch from Microsoft to open source by a local council, Bristol city council is planning to convert its 5,000 desktop computers to Sun's StarOffice system, which is based on open source. </p> <p>Dundee city council, meanwhile, has consolidated all its servers on to Linux. The council replaced 11 servers with one IBM zSeries mainframe, providing the equivalent performance of 25 virtual servers. The IT staff can react quickly to demand for new services by setting up a new virtual Linux server within minutes. The council runs much of its operations on a SuSE Linux enterprise server, including systems for payroll, housing, social services and web services. </p> <p>\"We have been using Linux since 1996, so the decision to move was a no-brainer,\" says Tim Simpson, IT manager at Dundee city council. The council said that moving to open source would allow it to upgrade its aging IT without increasing its licensing or administrative costs. </p> <p>Open source supplier IBM welcomed the OGC decision. \"This report emphasises many of the benefits open source offers government organisations as the UK continues to advance the e-government agenda,\" said Martin Goodman, director of IBM public sector business. </p> <p>Ian Watmore, the government's chief information officer, however, says that he has no opinion on open source, describing himself as a pragmatist. He says he wants to create a competitive market. </p> <p>Novell's Brown says he doesn't favour compulsion: \"I believe that free market forces will do the work.\" </p> <p>One long-standing critic of Microsoft, Eddie Bleasdale, of consultancy Netproject, welcomed the announcement. \"I am glad that government is jumping on the bandwagon.\" But he said making decisions on the total cost of onwership is \"fraught with difficulty\". \"Coming up with a generic cost model is not meaningful.\" </p> <p>Decisions, he said, should be made on \"what is best for your long-term future and this usually means you have control of your IT infrastructure and are no longer dependent on your supplier.\"</p>",
  "Mercy killings could be removed from the category of murder and no longer punished by a life sentence under the first fundamental review of murder law for more than 50 years, announced yesterday by the home secretary, David Blunkett. <p>The terms of reference have not yet been announced and Mr Blunkett insisted that the government remained committed to the mandatory life sentence. </p> <p>But a Home Office spokeswoman acknowledged that the review, to be led by the department with input from outside bodies, was likely to look at the question of how mercy killings should be treated. </p> <p>Any root-and-branch review would be bound to look at the possibility of reclassifying homicides now considered as murder and putting some in a lower category with discretion for judges over the sentence. </p> <p>Judges complain that current rules force them to treat all people convicted of murder in the same way. </p> <p>Many believe the mandatory life sentence fails to reflect the wide variations in crimes now classified as murder - at one extreme, the sadistic serial killing of children and, at the other, the injection by a doctor of a patient with only days to live, begging him to end the intractable pain. </p> <p>The review follows a Law Commission report in August which described the law as \"a mess\" and called for a major overhaul - including a rethink on whether the mandatory life sentence for murder should be retained - because of \"the breadth and depth of discontent\" with the current law. </p> <p>Senior judges have long argued that the best way to end the anomalies is to make life a maximum, rather than a mandatory, sentence and leave it to the judge to sentence according to the circumstances. </p> <p>In a new book, Malice Aforethought, Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC and Terence Morris, emeritus professor of criminology at LSE, call for a new offence of \"criminal homicide\" to replace murder and manslaughter, with no mandatory sentence but life as the maximum. </p> <p>The commission looked at the \"partial defences\" to murder - diminished responsibility and provocation, which reduce a murder charge to manslaughter - after Harriet Harman, the solicitor general, suggested that that the provocation defence, often invoked by husbands who kill their wives in a fit of jealousy, should be abolished. </p> <p>She hoped to include a provision in the domestic violence, crime and victims bill now going through parliament. </p> <p>But Mr Blunkett's decision to order a wholesale review, to start in 2005, is certain to delay any legislative changes for several years. </p> <p>The Home Office spokeswoman said the government's commitment to the mandatory life sentence \"does not stop the review from examining and recommending alternative ways to structure offences of homicide, or looking at issues on the construction of the offence such as the intention of the offender, possible defences and partial defences\". </p> <p>She said the Home Office was discussing with the Law Commission what role it should play in the review. </p> <p>The commission's consultation exercise showed that 64 respondents out of 146 - including 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every case of murder was \"indefensible and should cease\". </p> <p>The review will be the first wholesale re-examination of the subject since the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, which led to the 1957 Homicide Act.</p>",
  "<b>Independent </b> <br>Editorial, October 26 <p>\"[On Monday] David Blunkett unveiled a thoroughly illiberal plan to allow the details of defendants' previous convictions to be known to juries in cases of child sex abuse and theft.

It is impossible to believe that the decisions made by a jury, regaled with his previous convictions in this deeply disturbing area of criminal activity, will not be - albeit subconsciously - affected by this knowledge. Mr Blunkett should think again before he ends a system that helps ensure a fair trial.\" </p> <p><b>Magnus Linklater</b><br> Times, October 27 </p> <p>\"Tony Blair ... is proposing a reform that not only shoulders aside a central principle of the judicial system, it also turns a blind eye to the current state of common law.

Mr Blunkett's reforms are modest and overdue. Don't believe the doom-mongers who predict that English justice will be damaged. In truth, even though it is the only system we have, it is damaged already.\" </p> <p><b>John O'Connor</b><br> Daily Express, October 26 </p> <p>\"At a time when more and more juries are made up of bored housewives, the unemployed and the unemployable it is incumbent on the criminal justice system to give them as much information as possible ...

But where past convictions amount to evidence of similar facts and the offences charged are of a serious nature then it has to be right that the jury are made aware of all the circumstances. </p> <p>\"This is a great opportunity to bring respect back to the criminal justice system. The reforms are long overdue and will enable victims to feel that justice has been done.

  "<p>Thank heaven for Sainsbury's. Not for the stores but for last week's reminder that government is not alone in having IT disasters. There is no evidence that the public sector bungles more often than business. Given the extra hurdles facing government agencies - procurement rules and the complexities of public policy - this is quite an achievement. </p> <p>Every project has to work all the time. When government can't reach this level, it has to pretend. Managers are under colossal pressure to maintain that programmes are running on schedule and that consensus reigns even when projects are patently struggling. </p> <p>This outlook may account for the government's sniffy response to a thoughtful and provocative investigation into IT projects that the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee published in July. Under the conventional courtesies, the government's reply is \"we know what we're doing and we don't need your suggestions\". </p> <p>So, even when the Department for Work and Pensions agrees with a recommendation - on big bang projects, for example - it says it has taken action already. </p> <p>When the department disagrees, it is because it knows a better way. The committee's enthusiasm for \"concept viability\" - the idea of sounding out the market before a new system is procured - gets short shrift. \"The department is not convinced that the concept viability service would produce the best results for it. It is already increasingly working on a partnership basis with its main suppliers and so is able to get early industry intelligence in that way.\" </p> <p>This spectacularly misses the point of concept viability, which is to get a reality check before contracts are signed. </p> <p>Predictably, the department comes down against the committee's suggestions for more openness. Results of staff consultations, for example, are to remain secret. The excuse: as consultation is an iterative process throughout the lifespan of a project, it would be \"inappropriate\" to publish the result of a one-off consultation. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see whether this extraordinary position survives its first contact with the Freedom of Information Act. </p> <p>And, of course, the department dashes any hope that results of gateway reviews will enter the public domain. The government reply says that both the department and the Office of Government Commerce have been \"frank\" about the idea, which is civil service speak for hitting the ceiling. </p> <p>\"There are legitimate concerns around the need to protect government departments' onward programme of competitive supply, and to protect the inherent value of the openness and candour_ currently afforded by confidentiality.\" </p> <p>Bah. It is time to blow the whistle on this whole idea of commercial confidentiality in government. The sky didn't fall in when the Audit Commission Act required local authorities to make available details of their contracts with suppliers. What is so different about Whitehall?

  "<p>There was a fierce and fascinating contest played out here yesterday but only between two rival sets of Australia supporters, the internet-roused travelling fans from the Fanatics and Waving the Flag collectives, to see who could deafen the greater number of Indians with their noisy braggadocio . </p> <p>By comparison the cricket was a little dull and one-sided as Australia took charge of this third Test against a strangely lacklustre India who may lose inside four days unless they prove more resolute in their second innings. </p> <p>At the end of the second day India were 146 for five, still needing 53 runs to avoid the follow-on, though it is doubtful whether Australia's captain Adam Gilchrist would enforce it after his involvement in the extraordinary events in Kolkata in March 2001 when the home side won by 171 runs despite having been asked to bat again. </p> <p>Australia have learned to take nothing for granted after that compelling series, so these players are not saying too much at the moment. But they know they have a great chance to win this match and with it the series, which would be their first here for 35 years. </p> <p>A win for the tourists would also provide evidence that this single-minded side cannot be put off by such trifling matters as finding a cockroach in a bottle of soy sauce, as one player did during lunch at the team hotel before the match. </p> <p>He reported it to the restaurant manager, who denied it was a cockroach and then, to prove his point in true Basil Fawlty style, put the large insect in his mouth and swallowed it, to groans of horror and disbelief. </p> <p>Australia had resumed yesterday on 362 for seven and their innings lasted another 50 minutes in which they added 36 runs. India took the new ball as soon as it was offered and Jason Gillespie almost immediately fell lbw to Zaheer Khan before Michael Kasprowicz was caught behind off Ajit Agarkar for a duck. </p> <p>Michael Clarke, 73 overnight, was given determined support by Glenn McGrath and the pair put on 21 for the last wicket before Clarke, on 91, gave the wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel his second catch of the day. </p> <p>At last it was India's turn on a good pitch but they batted with such negativity that by the close they had scored only 146 from 77 overs. </p> <p>It was as if all their misfortunes in this series - the bad umpiring decisions in Bangalore, the rain that robbed them of a likely victory in Chennai, the three lost tosses, the injuries and illnesses, the controversy about the preparation of this pitch and Sourav Ganguly's sullen withdrawal from the match - had come together to produce an atmosphere of negativity. </p> <p>That should not detract from some superb bowling by Australia's three-man pace attack, particularly McGrath who finished with figures of 20-12-18-2. \"The wicket was a bit slow,\" he said. \"I just tried to stay patient and build pressure. The more I tired the better I bowled. </p> <p>\"I just held it across the seam at 45 degrees and some were skidding through. They scored at under two an over, which is pretty slow on a good batting wicket. I don't know what they were doing; I thought batting was easy when I was out there in the morning.\" </p> <p>Only Virender Sehwag had looked comfortable at the crease for India but he was not there long. Having crashed four fours in Gillespie's first over, two cover drives, a square drive and a chip over mid-on, he edged McGrath to the keeper for a 20-ball 22 and from then on it was all downhill. </p> <p>Aakash Chopra, who is slow at the best of times, edged to first slip after 42 balls for nine and India were 34 for two. At least this brought in Sachin Tendulkar, for whom the stadium trembled in anticipation. He and Rahul Dravid made it to lunch, by which time India were 35 for two, but soon after the break Tendulkar was lbw to Gillespie for a ponderous eight and India were 75 for four when VVS Laxman top-edged to Clarke at point after attempting to cut a long-hop from Shane Warne. </p> <p>Dravid was the fifth man out at 103 after batting for three hours, facing 140 balls for his 21 and never once attempting to seize control. India's salvation may yet lie with Mohammad Kaif, who was 47 not out at the close and looking as though he intended to remove the need for Gilchrist to make his decision.</p>",
  "<p>As the world focuses on the US presidential election, Americans are focused on the World Series, the best-of-seven games competition being fought out this year between the Boston Red Sox and St Louis Cardinals to determine the champions of Major League Baseball. </p> <p>To European ears it has always smacked of arrogance. How can a \"world series\" be contested among teams drawn from one country? A propensity to aggrandise the national sporting culture is not uniquely American (what the world knows as the English FA still refers to itself as \"the FA\"). None the less, under present circumstances, \"World Series\" seems symptomatic of a dangerously solipsistic popular consciousness. </p> <p>US sports fans are for the most part blissfully unselfconscious about the moniker. In fact, given the babble about \"the American way of life\" that accompanies election campaigns, it's amazing how unaware most Americans are of the features of their society that are distinctive. And one of these is its sporting culture. Where other staples of American popular culture - music, movies, sitcoms, cartoons, fashions - have proved hugely successful exports, American sport has enjoyed much more limited overseas appeal. Baseball does enjoy a mass following in Japan and Latin America, not least in Cuba, the US's arch-adversary. Nonetheless, the baseball cap has travelled much further afield than the game itself. </p> <p>Baseball illustrates one of American nationalism's distinctive characteristics: the identification of the universal with the American, an identification rooted in the belief that America is not one nation state among many but the unique embodiment of an idea. US sports culture is singular too in the degree to which teams are playthings of private owners. It has recently been confirmed that the Montreal Expos will move to Washington DC, whose previous clubs decamped decades ago to Minnesota and Texas. </p> <p>Baseball enjoys its remarkable freedom of movement partly thanks to the special protection it receives from the state (in which respect it is typical of US capitalism as a whole). The \"World Series\", launched in 1903, turned Major League Baseball into a cartel and reduced the players to serfs, barred from selling their labour to the highest bidder. </p> <p>The game's anomalous position as a privately owned public monopoly was confirmed by the supreme court in 1922 - which ruled that baseball was exempt from antitrust legislation, a status it still enjoys. In 1975 the players' union at last secured free-agent status for its members, whose salaries have increased exponentially since. The union has repeatedly resorted to the strike weapon and showed a commendable resistance to sentimentality in its willingness to close down the national pastime. As a result it can claim to be the world's most successful (if exclusive) trade union, with members' average annual wage now $2.5m. </p> <p>Baseball, like other games, has been mercilessly exploited by both nationalist demagogues and predatory businessmen. Indeed, it is an illuminating example of how the two are intertwined. But that shouldn't dull anyone's enjoyment of one of world sport's most entrancing spectacles. Baseball is a beguiling blend of ferocious individualism and collective coordination. And like all games, it belongs to no single culture. Just ask the Cubans. </p> <p><strong>&amp;#183</strong> Mike Marqusee has published various books on politics and popular culture </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mikemarqusee.com\">www.mikemarqusee.com</a></p>",
  "The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, was in a serious condition last night after a sharp deterioration in his health, Palestinian officials said. <p>A three-man emergency committee of Palestinian leaders was rapidly appointed as an ambulance rushed doctors to his Ramallah compound, where he has been confined by Israel for more than two years. </p> <p>One senior Palestinian official, who declined to be named, said that Mr Arafat, 75, was slipping in and out of consciousness. </p> <p>He said the Palestinian leader was \"extremely ill\" several days after aides said he was suffering only from flu and gallstones. </p> <p>The Palestinian foreign minister, Nabil Shaath, said Mr Arafat was being fed intravenously. </p> <p>Another Palestinian leader, Mustafa Barghouti, who visited Mr Arafat last night, said: \"The president is seriously sick. He has been unable to eat and he was vomiting. He has severe gastro-intestinal problems. There is a team of doctors with him and two other teams are on their way. He is a 75-year-old man, so it's serious.\" </p> <p>Dr Barghouti said he believed Mr Arafat would recover and that there were no plans to move him to hospital. But the drama was sufficiently serious to require Mr Arafat's wife, Suha, to fly to Ramallah from Paris, where she lives. </p> <p>His personal doctor for the past 20 years, Ashraf Kurdi, a Jordanian neurologist, was also en route for Ramallah, from Jordan. </p> <p>\"Arafat's aides called me urgently. I am taking a team to assess his condition and do whatever is possible that can be done. They refused to tell me what his condition was,\" said Dr Kurdi. </p> <p>Israeli officials told Haaretz newspaper last night that Mr Arafat would be permitted to travel anywhere he chooses for treatment, after more than two years as a prisoner in his Ramallah compound, the muqata. But the Palestinian leader has previously said he will not leave the occupied territories without a guarantee he will be allowed to return. </p> <p>Mr Arafat appointed three officials - the Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qureia, his predecessor, Mahmoud Abbas, and Salim Zanoun, a senior Palestinian Liberation Organisation official - to run affairs during his incapacitation. </p> <p>Rawhi Fatuh, the speaker of the Palestinian parliament, would become temporary head of the Palestinian Authority if Mr Arafat were to die. </p> <p>Mr Arafat has suffered from ill health for years and his latest affliction became apparent 10 days ago when he was unable to complete the first day of Ramadan prayers. Doctors from Egypt and Tunisia have visited, and he underwent an endoscopy to check his stomach earlier this week, fuelling speculation that he has intestinal cancer. </p> <p>Mr Shaath said the doctors had ruled that out. </p> <p>Palestinians continue to blame his ailment on a stubborn bout of flu. </p> <p>Shut away in his Ramallah redoubt and sidelined by Israel from the moribund Middle East peace process, Mr Arafat continues to wield considerable authority in the Palestinian sphere and many have grave doubts about the post-Arafat era. </p> <p>Some have predicted a bloody battle for ascendancy between the various factions once Mr Arafat has relinquished his three-decade hold over the Palestinian movement.</p>",
  "Poor old Jude Law. Despite his stellar acting career, he has had a tough time of it recently, what with his highly publicised divorce from Sadie Frost. Perhaps that's why he has slunk into a corner, tucked his knees up to his chin, and is sobbing his lovely eyes out, that eloquent vein on his forehead a-throb with the pain. <p>Or perhaps not. The image is actually one of a series of 16 photographs made by artist Sam Taylor-Wood of male actors, including Benicio Del Toro, Ben Stiller and Michael Gambon, crying like babies. </p> <p>According to Tim Marlow, the director of exhibitions at the London gallery White Cube, where the images will be unveiled on Friday, the subjects had no idea that she was going to ask them to cry until they arrived to be photographed. </p> <p>Not all of them could weep on demand: some took time to work up to it, and for others artificial means were resorted to. The \"authenticity\" of the emotions of the various sitters will be a matter of speculation for viewers. </p> <p>Some, however, needed very little encouragement before the floodgates opened. \"Gabriel Byrne looks as if he's on the verge of falling apart in his portrait - which is actually what was really going on,\" said Mr Marlow. </p> <p>\"Kris Kristofferson almost started to cry before she took the camera out: they had been talking about Johnny Cash and Janis Joplin, both of whom were friends of his. </p> <p>\"Sam sometimes felt very uncomfortable taking the pictures,\" he said. \"It was hard to tell whether she should sit round and pat them on the shoulder.\" </p> <p>Taylor-Wood is well-known for her artistic interrogations of celebrity, but this series is also an examination of constructions of masculinity, Mr Marlow said. \"In our culture masculinity is most often explained from the standpoint of the macho, predicated on men in control,\" he said, likening the (apparent) loss of control in these portraits to David Beckham's vulnerability in Taylor-Wood's video portrait of him asleep for the National Portrait Gallery. </p> <p>The exhibition will also contain a film called Strings, in which one of the stars of the Royal Ballet, Ivan Putrov, is suspended from wires just above the heads of a string quartet, making slow angelic swoops as they play. Imperceptibly to the uninitiated viewer, the film is shown at half speed. \"The quartet had to learn to play their parts at double speed: the dancer couldn't move that slowly through the air without juddering,\" said Mr Marlow. </p> <p>The final part of the show is a series of photographic self-portraits, showing Taylor-Wood twisted into variety of \"elegant, tough, contorted positions\".

  "<p>Florida scientists have hooked up a brain in a dish to a flight simulator and watched the disembodied grey cells handle the pitch and roll of a simulated F-22 fighter. All it took was a standard computer program, 60 electrodes and around 25,000 living neurons or nerve cells nourished in a laboratory dish. The brain cells were not even human: they were cultured from a lab rat. </p> <p>Dan Dare's enemy the Mekon was a brain kept alive in a flying saucer - and a comic strip menace to the solar system. Once again, science has caught up with science fiction. The culture of nerve cells grown by Thomas DeMarse of the University of Florida could ultimately help neuroscientists understand a little more about neural disorders, because it offers a chance to observe a simplified neural system at work in real time. But it was also an experiment in neural networking. </p> <p>First, the brain cells were added separately; then they began to establish connections with each other; and finally they began to form a community. That is, the capacity to compute emerged as a property of the network. DeMarse tested this by making a link with a desktop computer and flight simulator, and watching the feedback between flight programme and the dish of brain cells. </p> <p>\"Initially, when we hook this brain to a flight simulator, it doesn't know how to control the aircraft,\" he said. \"So you hook it up and the aircraft drifts randomly. As the data comes in, it slowly modifies the neural network so over time, the network gradually learns to fly the aircraft.\" The dish of brains is never likely to be cleared for takeoff and landing. It can, however, control pitch and roll of simulated aircraft in clear blue skies or even hurricane conditions. The underlying goal of the research is to understand how neurons interact as a network.</p>",
  "<p>At this year's NUS national conference, a gathering of more than 1,000 student representatives at our annual trip out to Blackpool, delegates debated and voted on a wide range of issues, from student halls privatisation, to the introduction of fees, to whether war is a valuable use of the Treasury pot. </p> <p>However, in-between the high profile arguments and the 'glamorous' issue of the growing higher education funding crisis, one short but immensely significant line slipped under conference's nose - \"to resolve to have a priority campaign on further education\". </p> <p>It is immensely doubtful that those who voted for such a resolve would have been aware of the political significance of raising their hands at that point, but for the student movement it could have come at no better time, as the last two weeks have been dominated by news of the FE sector. </p> <p>The launch of the Tomlinson review represents the clearest shake-up in education in the last 60 years and, it seems - from the press response, and personal conversations with a variety of interested parties - the most confusing. Will A-levels exist? More exams? Students forced to choose 'vocationalism'? </p> <p>Further education has never been the easiest of areas to understand. Funding mechanisms have for years been altered beyond all recognition, incorporation is still only partially understood by many who work in the sector and students locally all too easily put faults in their courses down to their local college, without any real knowledge of the control of the local Learning and Skills council. </p> <p>At a time of great confusion and rhetoric it's difficult to formulate a clear message on the review. Sometimes the student movement is accused of an unwillingness to make progress - a prevalent idea is that we're stuck in the 1970's - but in truth we're always in favour of progressive policy initiatives. All we ask is that regressive moves aren't used as a quick route to the end result.</p> <p>Today 49% of young people fail at 16 to reach the standard test for entering the next level of education, 5 A-C's. Tomlinson and his climbing frames have the potential to create a system of delivering diversity and choice of learning pathways that will suit the aspirations and needs of all young people. </p> <p>Learning can be effectively matched to the needs of young people, with positive benefits for employers, schools and colleges alike and most critically for the students - but of course we have concerns. A new radical system of routes and progression has to be adequately funded - a government commitment to this has not been forthcoming - and higher education institutions and employers must make the shift to valuing challenging vocational qualifications as highly as the traditional academic routes if the system is to be as radical as the author wishes it to be. </p> <p>But there are other significant concerns at this point. One of the key requirements of Tomlinson is that vocational courses must only be taught in venues with appropriate resources, equipment and qualified teachers; it doesn't take an expert on education minutia to recognise that it is further education institutions rather than local schools which will need to be equipped to deliver these courses and that has massive implications for the sector.</p> <p>The fact is that students from 16 - 96 choose further education colleges because they provide an adult learning environment. FE colleges provide a unique community to study within, with students from across the class, race and age spectrums mixing together in a unique situation. Teaching and learning are radically different, opportunities are diverse and - crucially - students have systems of representation in order for them to directly impact upon their learning environment. </p> <p>Students' unions, so accepted in our higher education institutions for their benefit in terms of student development and participation, are vital to the adult atmosphere that pervades most of our local colleges. </p> <p>Whilst this adult learning environment has the potential to be of huge benefit to 14 plus year-olds, for those disaffected from their current education, or simply those wishing to expand outside the traditional school curriculum, it is vital that FE remains the choice for all, regardless of age, who wish to study in a more flexible and self motivated environment. </p> <p>That means funding being adequately provided from government and local Learning and Skills Councils aimed specifically at this project. But it will also require the political will from the Association of Colleges and for individual college principals to resist the temptation of plugging funding gaps by accepting large numbers of under 16s without adequate resources and the supervision to provide freedom from harm. </p> <p>Only then will the whole of the college community, rather than solely those who hold the purse strings, welcome the under 16s to participate as 'junior members' of the FE environment.</p>",
  "<p><strong>A conscience</strong> <br>Lucy Lytton, hydrogeologist, Oxfam <br> Lucy Lytton went further than most to get her degree - to the University of New South Wales - where she took applied geology in the hope it would equip her for humanitarian work. </p> <p>It was while working for the New South Wales state government that she got her big break. </p> <p>\"I saw a notice on the wall for hydrogeologists to go to South Africa and I jumped at the chance,\" she says. </p> <p>During the three-month stint, she helped drill bore holes so local people could extract vital groundwater. \"In so many of these areas, water is often the most important thing,\" she says. </p> <p>Lucy is now a hydrogeologist with Oxfam, heading up a drilling team at the charity's base in Hadjer Hadid, Chad. When we called, her team was about to do a pump test on a new borehole. \"Once we've done that, we can advise Oxfam on the right pump to supply,\" she says. </p> <p>Drilling new boreholes has made it possible to provide water for refugee camps in the area, transforming the lives of those taken there. Without local abstraction points, people have to rely on water being trucked around, an expensive and tedious task given the poor roads and distances involved. </p> <p>And Lucy's advice for anyone wishing to do humanitarian work? \"Get some experience.

His job allowed him to complete a PhD and then he won a five-year research fellowship with the Marine Biological Association. \"That was my big break,\" he says. \"It let me work on exactly what I was interested in.\" It also brought him diving trips to the Azores. As well as frequent trips to Antarctica and southern islands such as the Falklands and South Georgia, Alex has also dived in New Zealand, Bali and is a regular on research cruises to exotic locations such as the equatorial Atlantic and not so exotic spots such as the deep North Sea. </p> <p>We interrupted Alex \"genotyping Patagonian toothfish\" in his Cambridge laboratory - analysing the DNA from fin clippings to better understand the different species for fish stock management.

His big break arrived when he overheard a Nobel prize winning physicist at Stanford University telling his then boss about the discovery of a subatomic particle called the tau neutrino. Three days later, Tom sold the nugget as a news story to New Scientist, his first freelance piece. \"It gave me confidence and allowed me to say I was a science journalist,\" he says. </p> <p>His most satisfying moment? \"I think that would be successfully talking for a minute and a half with out screwing up about Beagle 2's landing.

Life was about to get a lot rosier though. In 2001, Hunt shared the Nobel prize for medicine -worth \u00a3640,000 and a lot of kudos - with another Brit, Sir Paul Nurse and Leland Hartwell, a scientist in the US. \"My big break was actually not having a job. It gave me total freedom to do whatever I wanted to do, and I happened to make a discovery that won the Nobel prize,\" he says. </p> <p>Hunt has not seen much of the lab since being awarded the prize for research into cell regulators - he identified a protein called cyclin, which plays a key role in controlling cell growth and division. We caught him at the baggage carousel, on his return from giving a lecture in the US. \"I've been jetting around the world since 2001 and I'm getting very tired of it. I've only just started getting back into the lab and it's great.\" </p> <p>His advice for ambitious scientists? \"The really difficult thing is identifying the most important problem you can solve in a reasonable period of time.

The relentless workload could perhaps be too much for some people. </p> <p>The day we talk to Tom, he is taking some rare time off. He left Bear Stearns several years ago to work as a consultant to the European Investment Fund and is now writing a book on finance - he had delivered his final draft the night before. </p> <p>\"For the last three years, at this time I would be sitting in front of a computer, looking at spreadsheets,\" he says.

  "<p>The build-up to next week's US election has seen a strange transformation take place in the world of science. The traditional strategy of keeping heads well down when it comes to politics has given way to outright activism. More scientists than ever have waded into the electoral fray, pegging their allegiance firmly to the Democratic presidential candidate, John Kerry. </p> <p>To many, the mobilisation of scientists in favour of Kerry is inevitable, a consequence of the Bush administration's policies on stem cells and climate change. But some scientists believe that by aligning itself so strongly with a particular party, science may have set itself up for a fall. \"When the community gets on the political bandwagon, they lose control of how the facts are used,\" says a source within the US National Academy of Sciences, speaking on condition of anonymity. </p> <p>The result is that throughout the run-up to the election, science has been bent and mangled to fit the political message. \"Sooner or later, scientists are going to have to go back to reality and tell people the truth,\" according to the source. It could be an ugly and damaging process. </p> <p>Mass scientific support for Kerry kicked off with a letter of support from 48 Nobel laureates in June. Their stance inspired the formation of a new anti-Bush organisation, Scientists and Engineers for Change, who are sending scientists to swing states to warn of the perils of re-electing President Bush. Then there is Scientists and Engineers for Kerry-Edwards, a group of influential scientists who are urging the scientific community to come out and back the Democrat. \"What's different this time is there are scientists overtly challenging the Bush administration. I have no recollection of there being such overt efforts in past presidential elections,\" the source says. </p> <p>So how did scientists get to be so politically active in the election? \"There have been issues that have made many scientists uneasy and when politics begins to touch on things you know well and care about, you have to take a stand,\" says Robert Horvitz, the MIT biology professor and one of the 48 Nobel prizewinners to back Kerry. \"The notion that ivory towers are separate from political forces is naive.\" </p> <p>According to Robert S Walker, the first Republican chairman of the senate science committee, the Democrats have seized on their scientific support to divide the electorate. \"They've decided to politicise science and use it as a wedge issue. Using science to divide people like that is ultimately going to be destructive,\" he says. </p> <p>If Republicans have a problem with the Democrats' use of science, why don't they mobilise their own legions of scientists to give the other side of the argument? Part of the problem may be that they are simply outnumbered or unwilling to raise their heads above the parapet. </p> <p>\"Finding people in academia who are liberals is not very hard to do. It's almost a rite of passage on university campuses to proclaim your liberal credentials. There are conservatives in academia, but they usually do not go into the forefront with their views for fear of being ostracised on the campus,\" says Walker. </p> <p>Horovitz counters that the Bush administration politicised science in the first place, by trying to influence reports scientists had put together. \"You see it over and over again,\" he says. Indeed, the administration was accused of manipulating scientific advisory committees and censoring reports by the Union of Concerned Scientists earlier this year. </p> <p>While support for Kerry among academic scientists is apparently still strong, the downside of pledging their allegiance is beginning to become clear. The Democratic vice presidential candidate, John Edwards, made many scientists wince when he spoke at a recent rally in Newton, Iowa. \"If we do the work that we can do in this country, the work that we will do when John Kerry is president, people like Christopher Reeve are going to get up out of that wheelchair and walk again,\" he said, referring to the potential therapies that embryonic stem cells might one day offer. </p> <p>\"What's sad is that when he claimed stem cells would enable people to leave their wheelchairs, there wasn't one protest from any of those Nobel prizewinners about such a misuse of science in a campaign statement,\" says Walker. He says that Kerry's speeches regularly give the impression that viable stem cell therapies are just a few years away, when most scientists believe they will not be a reality for much longer. </p> <p>The Iowa rally wasn't the only time that scientists frowned at science being peddled at political meetings. In previous speeches, Kerry has stated that millions of people could be cured by stem cell therapies. The figure is a misrepresentation of data produced by the US National Academy of Sciences, the source said. The list simply gave estimates of the number of people with a range of medical conditions from Parkinson's disease to severe spinal damage. \"I was cringing, but it was the Kerry campaign people that distorted the facts.\" </p> <p>For now, it seems the scientific community is biting its tongue. \"Once the scientific community gets on the side of one candidate or the other, and that candidate goes out making mis-statements about science, is the community obliged to correct them? They're not going to if they want them to win.\" </p> <p>For the scientific community, the legacy of backing Kerry is likely to hit home some time after the election when the public realises that science may have been hyped throughout. Only then will scientists know whether backing Kerry was more trouble than it was worth. </p> <p>\"The bottom line is that the scientific community is experiencing pain enduring this president, so a lot of people would say that no matter what the repercussions, it's worth it.\"</p>",

At the moment, Windows doesn't, so it uses the Athlon's 32-bit mode. Intel's Pentium 4 has the advantage of hyper-threading, where one processor works much like two. This is something Windows XP does support today, and the result is better multi-tasking. </p> <p>However, in most circumstances, there is probably not much difference between the two. The only people who are really bothered are serious games players and those with high-end requirements where processor speed makes a practical difference, in which case we would be talking about the Athlon 64 FX range. Either way, the decision would ultimately depend on running benchmarks with a small number of critical applications, and the result could have more to do with the way the software has been written than which chip is technically \"faster\". </p> <p>The real question is whether such high-end chips are good value for average users. You will not get the full benefits of either unless you install lots of memory - at least 512MB - and a fast graphics card. This is OK if money is no object. However, if you are working to a budget, it is usually better to save money on the processor and spend it on extra memory and a bigger hard drive. In my case - since my main tasks are word processing and email - I spend more on the screen and keyboard. </p> <p><strong> Doomed</strong><br> I have had an email from my ISP which says: \"Your account has been used to send a large amount of unsolicited email during the last week. Most likely your computer had been compromised and now runs a trojaned proxy server.\" What should I do?  <strong>Name withheld</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS: </strong> You have probably received a hoax message sent by MyDoom, a common Windows virus. Usually the email asks you to \"follow our instruction in the attached text file in order to keep your computer safe\", or something similar. The attachment is the virus, and should have been identified as such by your anti-virus software. If you don't have any, download Grisoft's free AVG, take your PC offline, restart it and run the virus checker. After completing the scan and removing any viruses, restart your PC and scan it again. Then go online and do another check with a different web-based virus scanner such as Trend's Housecall or Symantec. You may well find your PC does not have any viruses. MyDoom is a mass-mailing worm and has sent the same or similar emails to millions of innocent users. </p> <p><strong> Mail slicing</strong><br> When I send large attachments - JPeg, Word, Excel files - Norton AV appears to split the email into several parts that cannot be reassembled by some recipients. They just get huge character lists. What is going wrong?  <strong>Keith Bater</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS: </strong> The internet can only guarantee to deliver 7-bit ASCII (text) files, and many mail systems have a limit on file size. So, to handle large binary files, mail programs such as Microsoft Outlook convert the file into text - your \"huge character lists\" - and chop it into smaller pieces. The recipient's mail program should be able to recombine and decode the pieces. However, someone using a Web-based mail system may have to download the files and recombine them separately. </p> <p>Your mail program should allow you to choose whether or not to split large files, and set a maximum file size. In Outlook Express, for example, go to Tools|Accounts and select the Mail tab for the service you use. Click the Properties button and then the Advanced tab on the Properties sheet. In your case, there should be a tick in the checkbox marked Sending, and a maximum file size - the default is 60K, which is ridiculous. You can either untick this box or type in a larger number such as 1024K (ie a megabyte), though this will be too big for some mailboxes. </p> <p>You can make many files much smaller by compressing them before you send them. WinRAR is good for this. However, the recipient then has to use the same or a compatible program to uncompress them. Zip is the most common format. It is not worth compressing JPeg image files. </p> <p><strong> Backchat</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Last week, a reader wanted a mobile phone that was also Wi-Fi compatible. That day, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced it had certified the first round of such \"converged\" products. The list includes three phones, the HP iPaq Pocket PC h6315, the Nokia 9500 Communicator and the Motorola MPx, and a Wi-Fi Convergence Accessory, the SanDisk Connect Wi-Fi SD card. Thanks to Alan Burkitt-Gray, editor of Global Telecoms Business, for forwarding the press release. </p>"
