  "<p>We decided to do The King of Comedy and there was an imminent director's strike looming. If you didn't start shooting by a certain date and have four weeks of important scenes - not just a character crossing the street - in the can, then the film would be stopped while you were shooting. On this film we had a first-time producer, Arnon Milchan, who was really a terrific guy, but he insisted that we had to start shooting on June 1. This was four weeks before we had planned and I told him we wouldn't be ready. He replied that we were going to have to start. I looked at Bob [De Niro] and said, 'Do you think we can do it?' he said, 'Yes,' but physically I didn't feel ready. I shouldn't have done it and it soon became clear that I wasn't up to it. By the second week of shooting I was begging them not to let me go on. I was coughing on the floor and sounding like a character from The Magic Mountain.</p> <p>Finally it got so bad that some days I wouldn't get there until 2.30 in the afternoon. One day we managed to shoot the whole scene in Sardi's between 2.30 and 7pm. Then the whole picture slowed down - and this was the big time now. We were shooting in New York and there was maybe five trailers, which you had to park in a certain way because the teamsters wanted this and the police wanted that. Finally, if you wanted to move, the entire company had to go along like a caravan through the city streets in the daytime.</p> <p>We didn't get one break from anybody there, or at least that's how it felt. If we wanted something, we had to pay for it and pay a lot. It was like making a film with a dinosaur: the tail was so big it was wagging and slamming into everything, perhaps not intentionally, but destroying things as in a Godzilla movie. Both Bob and I were tired and we just had to wait all the time.</p> <p>By this stage we were shooting every day from 4 to 7pm, for three intensive hours. The whole film took 20 weeks to shoot. The director always sets the pace and maybe a faster cameraman would have got me moving. But I didn't do it, so what went wrong is really all my responsibility. But I don't feel anything went wrong in front of the camera. I always felt that between \"Action\" and \"Cut\", I was there enjoying it and we had a great time. Rehearsals were good, Jerry Lewis was great and everybody else was terrific. But it was a very strange movie. The scene when Rupert Pupkin turns up uninvited at Jerry's house was extremely difficult for everyone. It took two weeks and it was just so painful because the scene itself was so excruciating.</p> <p>[Scorsese later commented that although The King of Comedy was very funny, it was not a comedy. Certainly the embarrassment generated by Rupert Pupkin, the crazed mediocrity with delusions of talent, determined to become a star even if he has to kidnap a real one, was very different from the fear and/or sympathy associated with previous Scorsese-De Niro anti-heroes. Scorsese's shooting style, too, was disconcertingly plain after the striking experimentation of earlier films.]</p> <p>People had reacted in such a way to Raging Bull, saying it was a beautiful film - like Days of Heaven, you could take every frame and put it on the wall - that I decided my next picture was going to be 1903 style, more like Edwin S Porter's The Life of an American Fireman, with no close-ups. So in King of Comedy that's what I tried to do. </p> <p>When it was shown on the first night at the Cannes Festival, I went backstage with Sergio Leone and he looked at me and said, \"Martin, that's your most mature film\". I don't know if it was his way of saying he didn't like it. I guess that comes to mind because over the years my friends and I have had a running joke about slow movies, weher the camera doesn't move, as being \"mature\". I read in the Village Voice that Jim Jarmusch, who made Stranger Than Paradise and Down by Law, said something like, \"I'm not interested in taking people by the hair and telling them where to look.\" Well, I do want them to see the way I see. Walking down the street, looking quickly about, tracking, panning, zooming, cutting and all that sort of thing. I like it when two images go together and they move. I guess it may not be considered \"mature\", but I enjoy it.</p> <p>Paul Zimmerman had written the script about 14 years before with, I believe, Dick Cavett in mind for the part of the chat-show host. Of course, we really wanted Johnny Carson, but a lot of people felt that Carson wasn't right because the phenomenon of his talk show wasn't that well known outside America. Besides, Johnny wouldn't do it. He said, \"Listen, you know one take's enough for me\". I said it would be one or two takes at the most, but he knew what filming would be like. So I thought, \"My God, Sinatra would be the best.\" And if we went that way towards the Vegas crowd, there was Joey Bishop, Sammy Davis Jr, that whole Ocean's Eleven group - I just love that crowd and their clothes! We even considered Orson Welles, but he wasn't \"show business\" enough. Then I thought - well, Dean Martin and then, of course, Jerry Lewis. </p> <p>Now Lewis is not only a stand-up comic and a director, but also a philanthropist, because of his incredible telethon for cerebral palsy, which with its combination of money pouring in for charity and its Vegas sensibility, seems at times to verge on nervous breakdown. Also the thin line between reality and drama seems to be shattered constantly during the telethon. Anyone who could conjure up and sustain this atmosphere is quite extraordinary. I'd never met Jerry, but he turned out to be terrific to work with. I was just recovering from pneumonia and I found it difficult to deal with the usual problems that arise on a set. He said, \"I know I'm Number Two in this picture. I won't give you any difficulty and I'll do what you want. I'm a consummate professional. I know where I stand. If you want me to wait around, you're paying for my time, I'll do that.\" Feeling the way I did then, it was very liberating to hear that. He was very funny between takes and when he started cracking jokes I'd get asthma attacks from laughing. It got to the point of being maniacal, you had to shake him to stop it! But he also really got into the dramatic stuff. In a scene where he's talking to Bobby and says, \"I'm just a human being, with all the foibles and all of the traps, the show, the pressure, the groupies, the autograph hounds, the crew, the incompetents\" - that was improvised by him. I think he's a wonderful actor.</p> <p>The King of Comedy had very little improvisation, just wall-to-wall dialogue, which is not surprising since the screenwriter, Paul Zimmerman, speaks even faster than me! We couldn't fit the music in, and though Robbie Robertson put together a terrific soundtrack you can't hear it in the film because it would have drowned out the dialogue. What improvisation there was came mainly from Sandra Bernhard in the sequence in which she tries to seduce Jerry. Sandra is a stand-up comedienne and I used a lot of her stage performance in that scene. The sexual threat to Jerry was very important, but he used to crack up laughing. Then it became difficult to deal with, and his comments and jokes became edgier, throwing Sandra off for a little while. Finally he worked it all out and helped her with the scene. </p> <p>People in America were confused by The King of Comedy and saw Bob as some kind of mannequin. But I felt it was De Niro's best performance ever. The King of Comedy was right on the edge for us; we couldn't go any further at that time.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Taken from Scorsese on Scorsese, edited by Ian Christie and David Thompson (Faber, \u00a314.99)</p>",
  "Chechnya's violent present and its uncertain future dominated the Russian press this week as the republic's sixth president, Moscow-friendly Alu Alkhanov, was inaugurated amid tight security. <p>A little over a month after the Beslan school siege, all the serious papers splashed details of the ceremony on their front pages and reminded readers that three previous presidents of the separatist-minded republic had been assassinated. </p> <p><b>Izvestia</b> pictured a glum looking Mr Alkhanov sitting at a desk, flanked by a young soldier clutching a machine gun and a Chechen fighter in traditional dress clasping a dagger. </p> <p>The paper reported that the location for the ceremony - Grozny, the Chechen capital - had only been made public at the last minute; that mobile phone communications in the area had been disabled for the event; and that the venue had been meticulously checked for bombs. Akhmad Kadyrov, Mr Alkhanov's predecessor, was blown up last May as he reviewed a military parade. </p> <p>Izvestia described an awkward and stilted inauguration ceremony, in which schoolchildren recited poetry and officials offered sickly praise. Among the gifts was an Arab racehorse, which, the paper noted, was descended from a thoroughbred given to Nikita Khrushchev by the Egyptian government. </p> <p>Readers hoping for some light relief had to look long and hard this week, as one of the Russia's worst ever kidnappings ended in tragedy. </p> <p>Yevgeny Bandorin was taken hostage on September 20 by a gang in the Saratov region, who demanded a $1m (\u00a3560,000) ransom. <b>Mosnews.com</b> reported that the gang had chosen their hostage carefully. Although Yevgeny had no money to speak of, his brother Aleksei is the head of a major bank's board of directors and his father, Mikhail, has recently retired from the board of one of Russia's biggest energy companies. </p> <p><b>Nezavisimaya Gazeta</b> said the special operation to secure Yevgeny's release had been one of the most poorly managed operations in the last decade. Aleksei agreed to meet the kidnappers' demands and took the money to the specified meeting place near a river. But, crucially, he did not go alone. </p> <p>His bodyguard and a police officer went along, too. When the kidnappers saw he was accompanied they opened fire with machine guns and detonated a hand grenade. </p> <p>Aleksei and the police officer were killed outright and the bodyguard was badly wounded. Yevgeny's lifeless body was discovered in a nearby copse the next day. His body was badly decomposed, suggesting he had been killed well before the disastrous handover. </p> <p>The gang made a quick getaway in a waiting speedboat with all the money; police say they have no leads. </p> <p>The English-language <b>Moscow Times</b> did, however, have a cheery tale, reporting that authorities in the town of Belgorod had launched an unconventional campaign to stop young people swearing. </p> <p>Anyone caught swearing in public is being fined up to 1,500 roubles (\u00a330) and the worst offenders could face up to 15 days in jail. </p> <p>The paper said that 2,490 people had been fined since the scheme was launched three months ago and that 500,000 roubles had been collected. \"Police have a good reason to enforce the law: arresting officers get to pocket 30% of the fines,\" it noted. </p> <p>But the paper quoted an anonymous resident as saying the police were the worst people to enforce the edict: \"They swear in communicating among themselves. If they had to fine somebody, they'd have to fine themselves first.\" </p> <p>The most bizarre story of the week, however, was carried by the <b>BBC</b>'s Russian online service which investigated a surreal ad on the front of daily <b>Moskovsky Komsomolets</b> purportedly selling an aircraft carrier. </p> <p>The original ad, which was presumably aimed at one of Russia's growing army of billionaires, offered readers the chance to buy an aircraft carrier \"in excellent condition, unarmed and cheaply\". It looked like a joke, but the BBC said it was deadly serious and concerned a decommissioned British ship called HMS Vengeance. </p> <p>\"A reminder for sceptics: once upon a time a billionaire made a similar purchase. Aristotle Onassis's famous yacht was built on the bones of a second world war military transport ship and Russia has more than its fair share of wealthy eccentrics,\" the website cautioned.</p>",

  "<p>When is a promise, guarantee or pledge absolutely nothing of the sort? The answer (obvious, really) is when it is provided by a life insurance company. </p> <p>Standard Life's decision to abandon the mortgage promise it made four years ago to endowment holders is a shabby decision that has little to do with the members who own the organisation and everything to do with pleasing the City investors who will soon be Standard's shareholders. </p> <p>It is also another massive blow to the reputation of the insurance industry, which will further undermine the government's attempts to encourage individuals to save and make more adequate provision for their retirement. </p> <p>Standard's bosses have taken advantage of the 600,000 customers covered by its pledge.

The hire business still provides the trussed-up togs for Ascot, but thanks to its scooter-riding chief executive Philip Mountford's \"thinking outside the box\" it offers Ted Baker lounge suits and its market share has doubled to 25%. </p> <p>What was a tired, loss-making, family-run business has become the business equivalent of a rather natty dresser. </p> <p>And the man behind this astonishing transformation? A big hand please for Mr Shami Ahmed, the founder of Joe Bloggs jeans, who is having a little local difficulty with the law (he has been charged with conspiracy to impersonate a customs and excise officer). </p> <p>Nearly three years ago - with Moss Bros heading for a \u00a37m loss and the shares languishing about 30p - Mr Ahmed took a tilt at Moss Bros, despite the founding families owning more than a third of the shares. Three times he rattled their cage before the Takeover Panel issued one of its put-up-or-shut-up orders, which led to Mr Ahmed selecting the latter. </p> <p>His presence prompted action from chairman Keith Hammill, who hired Adrian Wright to turn around the chain. And he was doing quite a good job until Mr Hammill decided what was needed was a bit more flash and dash - in the shape of ex-Versace man Mr Mountford. </p> <p>Yesterday, announcing a first-half profit and an interim dividend after a five-year drought, Mr Mountford was in a tiggerish mood, but keen to stress that current trading - with like-for-likes up 18% - was unsustainable because the numbers had been boosted by last year's poor sales and store upheavals. </p> <p>The Moss store revamps, which are generating sales uplifts of 20%, are not even half finished and a move to more own-brand items will boost margins. </p> <p>And just to make it all a little more interesting, with Kevin Stanford waiting in the wings with a 5% stake and a load more contracts for difference, there is always the chance of some more takeover action. </p> <p><strong> Swiss accuracy </strong><br> </p> <p>This month Ofcom will give the telecoms industry the first true indication of the direction it wants regulation to take in this country.

  "<p>A board room bust-up at the Royal Mail has consolidated the power of chief executive Adam Crozier and led to the departure of deputy chairman Elmar Toime with a \u00a3500,000 pay-off. </p> <p>Mr Toime joined the Royal Mail in February last year, a month before Mr Crozier arrived, and was charged with looking after the letters business and Parcelforce worldwide. He also chaired the management board. </p> <p>But Mr Crozier - former chief executive of the Football Association - wrenched control of letters from Mr Toime in May and a couple of weeks ago took over chairmanship of a newly-structured management board. </p> <p>Mr Crozier is poised to oversee the Parcelforce operation. The position of deputy chairman is likely to be scrapped. </p> <p>Mr Toime, a former chief executive of the New Zealand postal business, was said by Royal Mail to be leaving to \"pursue opportunities as a consultant to the international postal sector\". </p> <p>Chairman Allan Leighton gave a muted farewell to him in a statement yesterday while the Royal Mail refused to comment further on the circumstances surrounding Mr Toime's departure. </p> <p>Industry experts said Mr Toime had become increasingly frustrated at his diminished role and was leaving with 12 months salary and a possible bonus contribution. </p> <p>Mr Toime's exit comes at an acute time for the Royal Mail, which has been struggling to meet performance targets and faces an earlier than expected introduction of full competition in the postal market. </p> <p>The departure was announced alongside the appointment of a new non-executive director in Baroness Margaret Prosser.

  "With the release of the 918-page report of the Iraq Survey Group, many people are again asking how the intelligence agencies in Britain and the US could have got it so wrong. Why did they express confidence in a proposition - that Iraq had ample weapons of mass destruction - without a scrap of evidence? <p>I think the answer turns on how the issues came to be framed. This is important for future intelligence analyses, as well as for historians. In the UK, the Butler report echoed the Hutton inquiry that exonerated the government from charges of lying but concluded that the joint intelligence committee might have been unconsciously influenced by propinquity to 10 Downing Street; in the US the Senate intelligence committee blamed \"collective groupthink\" and a shortage of human intelligence assets. </p> <p>\"Groupthink\", a lack of \"humint,\" \"unconscious political pressures\" - all seem plausible candidates for blame. But how could these phenomena account for the fact that the intelligence agencies of France, Germany, and Russia concurred in the erroneous assessment, even as their political masters swerved away from the policy of regime change? They can't all have been unconsciously pressured, as their governments disagreed. </p> <p>I believe this intelligence failure can be traced to our ideas of what constitutes proof, and what happens to an issue when the \"burden of proof\" shifts, asymmetrically. Many people think of proof - at a trial, for example - as a fact that stands apart from judgment. But there is no fact that determines a murderer (as opposed to the killer), or the existence of God, or whether someone loves you. It is always and only a matter of judgment applied to proof, and in Iraq judgment had been decisively structured by earlier intelligence failures. </p> <p>In the summer of 1995, UN inspectors were only weeks away from a report giving Saddam Hussein a clean bill of health on the charge of pursuing WMD. This report was important because investigations in 1991 after the first Gulf war had stunned western intelligence agencies with the discovery that Iraq was just a year from deploying a nuclear weapon. The significance of this intelligence failure could have been catastrophic; it would have meant that Iraq possessed a counter-deterrent, a capacity to preclude a force like the Gulf war coalition, should Saddam make a new lunge for his neighbour's oilfields. So one can imagine the consternation when Saddam's son-in-law, Hussein Kamal, defected and brought knowledge of new clandestine WMD programmes. </p> <p>Kamal's debriefing left no doubt that the UN inspectors and intelligence agencies had been fooled; he even named the person running Iraq's deception operations. And he stated that deployable Iraqi stocks of WMD had been destroyed on his orders. </p> <p>These revelations had a decisive effect on the intelligence agencies. In the search for evidence inside a totalitarian society, they had twice been fooled. Given the stakes - preventing Iraq from dominating the oil region with nuclear weapons - they stood on the brink of an historic failure. The effect was to shift the burden of proof from the requirement of evidence of the presence of WMD programmes to that of their permanent dismantlement. It was now necessary to find convincing evidence not just of the destruction of stocks, but that no clandestine programmes were under way. But how could the intelligence agencies disprove the proposition that somewhere Saddam was busily working at a WMD programme, especially in light of an avalanche of intercepts that was evidence of calculated, ongoing deception? </p> <p>Historians will find that there were many complex judgments to be made before the authorising of action to change the Iraqi regime. Some depended on assumptions about the interim period before a legitimate regime was in place. It has not gone well. It may be that here, too, the decision procedure - preparing for only one scenario, mistakenly regarded as the likeliest - holds the key to our failures. Paul Bremer's statement this week that far too few troops were provided seems to confirm this conjecture. </p> <p>Decisions about the future can seldom be settled by facts in the present. Suppose Hans Blix established that there were no WMD. The ISG report, based on interviews with Saddam's inner circle, concludes he would have resumed a nuclear programme once sanctions ceased. </p> <p>If Blix had found weapons, that would have been decisive; but there is no fact, discoverable by inspectors or anyone else, that could assure us that Saddam would not simply use the $11bn we know was skimmed from the oil-for-food operation to buy nuclear weapons once the inspectors left. These are, ultimately, matters of judgment. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Philip Bobbitt is a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and a former director for intelligence programmes at the US national security council</p>",
  "Hundreds of cats are being drafted in to tackle a plague of hundreds of thousands of rats taking over an isolated village in northern Mexico. <p>The state authorities transported the first few dozen cats to Atascaderos in the Tarahumara mountain region this week and said they hoped 300 more will follow by the weekend. </p> <p>The aim is that every household should eventually receive one. </p> <p>The cats are being recruited in the city of Chihuahua, three hours' drive north, partly through advertisements in the local press asking for donated pets and strays. </p> <p>Traps for the rats are being set in the village and its surrounding fields, and balls of maize, sugar and plaster intended to kill the rats by blocking their intestines are being scattered. </p> <p>Health officials are also organising hygiene workshops in the hope of keeping disease at bay. </p> <p>\"It's like The Pied Piper of Hamelin, but unfortunately that flautist doesn't exist and what we have here is an imminent health problem,\" Roberto Gallegos, the local health official in charge of cat recruitment, told the Associated Press. </p> <p>The rat problem in Atascaderos began a year ago but got out of control after villagers used a particularly strong poison that also killed off the rodents' natural predators, including the local cats. </p> <p>A teenager interviewed on Mexican television said the infestation was now so acute that he killed between 10 and 20 rats every night. </p> <p>As their numbers swell the rats are also getting bolder, fearlessly wandering around during the day as they chomp their way through corn stores, maize fields and apple orchards. </p> <p>The fear is that they could begin to attack animals and people too. </p> <p>Neighbouring villages are also reporting rat invasions.</p>",
  "The government of Pakistan yesterday moved to ban all religious gatherings, except those at mosques, after bombs planted in a car and on a motorcycle exploded at a rally commemorating the death of an assassinated Sunni Muslim radical, killing at least 40 people and wounding more than 100. <p>The attack yesterday in the city of Multan, 300 miles south-west of the country's capital, Islamabad, came after a night-long public meeting had broken up in the early hours of the morning. </p> <p>Thousands of people had gathered to mark the first anniversary of the shooting of Azam Tariq, head of the Sunni radical group Sipah-e-Sahaba, now known as Millat-e-Islami. The organisation was banned by the authorities last year because of its alleged involvement in sectarian violence. </p> <p>Television pictures showed bloody clothes and bits of car strewn across a muddy field. \"It was dark and people were screaming for help,\" one witness told Reuters. \"It was utter chaos.\" Police had discounted the possibility of a suicide attack, saying no body parts were found inside the remains of the vehicle. </p> <p>Pakistan's interior minister, Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao, told reporters that he had advised provincial governments to be on the alert for attacks during Friday prayers today, which have become a traditional time for militant bomb attacks on mosques. He said that he would advise provincial governments to ban all religious \"gatherings, processions and congregations\" until further notice. </p> <p>There was speculation that the bombing was retaliation by Shia groups incensed by an attack last week by a suicide bomber on a mosque, which killed 30 people. Shia Muslims account for about 20% of Pakistan's 150 million population, the remainder being predominately Sunni. </p> <p>Sectarian conflict is not new in Pakistan, where hardline groups have fought each other for almost two decades, although it has rarely spiralled into an orgy of violence. The vast majority of both sects live in relative peace. </p> <p>Despite earlier suggestions by the Pakistani information minister that yesterday's car bomb could have been a revenge attack by Shia hardliners, the country's interior minister claimed it was simply an act of terrorism. It had \"no relevance to the sectarian divide\", he said. He added that he did \"not see the involvement of any religious group\". </p> <p>There were also reports of thousands of angry Sunnis gathered outside a hospital in Multan, where victims of the explosions were taken, shouting \"Shias are infidels!\" and raising slogans against the government. </p> <p>\"This is the worst kind of terrorism, and everybody knows who is behind it,\" Ahmad Ludhianvi, the head of Sipah-e-Sahaba, told Associated Press. He urged calm among his supporters but accused the government of negligence and demanded the arrests of the attackers within a week. \"We are peaceful, but there will be no guarantee for peace after one week if those who have killed our people are not arrested,\" Mr Ludhianvi told 5,000 mourners at a mass funeral for victims that was held yesterday afternoon. </p> <p>The leader of the main Shia militant group, the banned Islami Tehrik Pakistan, denied any responsibility for the attack. \"We condemn it,\" said Abdul Jalil Naqvi, adding that the bombing was aimed at inciting war between the country's two communities. </p> <p>Officials said thousands of police officers, including reservists, and soldiers were patrolling the city to try to stop Sunni and Shia groups from clashing. Multan has been the scene of fighting between Sunni and Shia groups in the past. The government had also closed schools and colleges to prevent rival student organisations rioting. </p> <p>Police tightened security in other cities in the country. In Karachi, the scene of sectarian terrorist attacks and unrest during May, extra police were being deployed at mosques. </p> <p>The bombing also came hours after the burial of a top al-Qaida operative and Sunni Muslim militant, Amjad Hussain Farooqi, at a village in eastern Punjab province. </p> <p>Farooqi was killed in a shootout with Pakistani soldiers last month. Although described as a leading light in al-Qaida, he had also been accused of attacks on Shias. </p>",
  "A Thai police detective yesterday confessed to murdering two British backpackers at a popular tourist destination last month. He said he shot the man after feeling unable to win a physical argument and then in rage killed the woman by mistake. <p>Sergeant Somchai Visetsingha admitted shooting Adam Lloyd, 25, and Vanessa Arscott, 24, on September 9 near the River Kwai in Kanchanaburi. He surrendered to the authorities yesterday morning. </p> <p>He had been sheltering with ethnic Karen rebels since fleeing Kanchanaburi following the incident, Thai police said. </p> <p>During his emotional confession Mr Somchai apologised to Ms Arscott's parents, Joyce and Graham, from Ashburton, Devon, and asked for their forgiveness. </p> <p>The fatal incident followed a 2am row between Mr Somchai and Mr Lloyd at the detective's restaurant on the bank of the river 70 miles west of Bangkok. </p> <p>In the middle of the argument, Ms Arscott left the restaurant and started walking home. Mr Somchai said he offered Mr Lloyd a lift to his hotel, but the Briton beat him up. </p> <p>\"That western man beat me up badly and spit on me, fractured my ribs, smashed my nose and brow,\" he said. </p> <p>While fleeing the scene in his car, the detective allegedly drove into Ms Arscott, who was trying to prevent his escape. She was dragged down the road for about 200 metres before Mr Somchai stopped, got out of the car and shot at her in his panic to get away. </p> <p>\"I meant to kill the man, but hit her accidentally,\" he said. \"I think I fired all five bullets in my pistol's chamber.\" </p> <p>Detectives said the suspect would be charged with murder, which carries a maximum penalty of death. </p> <p>The families of both victims yesterday expressed thanks to the Thai authorities. </p> <p>Police carried out a reconstruction of the crime at the scene with Mr Somchai yesterday afternoon, a standard practice in Thai investigations. </p> <p>Mr Lloyd and Ms Arscott were at the end of a holiday to Thailand and Cambodia when they were killed. Their parents said they had been due to fly home the previous weekend but could not get a flight.</p>",
  "Only at the age of 59 did Brian Bagnall set about making his living by drawing cartoons, following a career as an architect and businessman. Yet within three years, he was a successful professional, and remained so until his death, at the age of 83. <p>Bagnall had always demonstrated to those around him his gift for exquisite pen-and-ink or pencil line drawing of anything that took his interest, on anything that came to hand - paper napkins, menus or the backs of envelopes. He could capture a likeness with a few strokes of the pen: his caricatures were wry, witty and perceptive, but never nasty or cruel. Frequently, he would accompany the drawing with verse. </p> <p>Once he had decided to put his talent to work, Bagnall sent off cartoons continuously to newspapers and magazines, until, in 1982, Private Eye started to publish his work. He illustrated the Dear Bill column, documenting the supposed correspondence between prime minister's spouse Denis Thatcher and his friend Bill Deedes, of the Daily Telegraph, in every Private Eye from 1984 to 1990, and his work also appeared in History Today, Boz, the Spectator, Punch, the Oldie and the Observer. His last cartoon was sent to the Oldie from his hospital bed three weeks before he died. </p> <p>Bagnall had solo exhibitions at the Arts Club, in Dover Street, London (1983), and the Surrey University Art Gallery (1984, 1986 and 1989), and took part in group shows at the Cartoon Gallery, London, and in Warsaw and Belgrade. As an illustrator, he contributed to books both humorous and technical. </p> <p>Born in Manchester, Bagnall was the eldest of five siblings, and his third forename, Mary, pointed to his staunch Catholic background; in later life, he devoted much time and effort to his local church. At the outbreak of the second world war, he joined the Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry, and, from 1941 to 1946, served in the Royal Artillery, reaching the rank of captain. He landed in France two days after D-Day, and was captured shortly afterwards, spending nine months as a prisoner-of-war. </p> <p>Having decided, while in captivity, to become an archi- tect, on demobilisation Bagnall studied at Liverpool University, winning a Fulbright award in 1950 and graduating in 1952. After five years working as a professional architect in London, in 1957 he became a sales executive, and later a director, with Bison Concrete. He was made redundant after the business was taken over in 1980, and so became free to concentrate on drawing. </p> <p>Bagnall was always immaculately dressed, with his 11 pairs of shoes polished once a week. He was polite, patient, courteous, gentle and generous, and loved to meet a wide circle of friends at his family home, an 18th-century National Trust watermill in Shalford, Surrey, the nearby pub, or at the many clubs and societies to which he belonged, including the Arts Club, of which he was chairman from 1976 to 1982. </p> <p>In 1950, he married Joanna Macgregor; she, their son and four daughters survive him. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Brian George Mary Bagnall, cartoonist and illustrator, born April 22 1921; died August 11 2004</p>",
  "A reservist airman who refused to take part in the Iraq war because he did not want to fight against fellow Muslims lost his appeal in the high court yesterday against his prosecution by the RAF for going absent without leave. <p>Mohisin Khan, 25, from Ipswich in Suffolk, who had absented himself on the grounds of conscientious objection and claimed his \"right to manifest his religion\" under the European convention on human rights had been breached, said he would take the case further. </p> <p>Mr Khan, a leading aircraftman and medic, was mobilised last year as the threat of war in Iraq loomed. He had joined the RAF in 1999 but was allowed to resign in 2001 because the job \"did not suit him\", his QC, Nicholas Blake, said. </p> <p>The court was told he held a \"genuine and deep belief\" that the pending war was wrong because it was not a question of a state exercising self defence. </p> <p>Lord Justice Rix and Mr Justice Forbes ruled that there was no interference with his rights \"by reason of the appellant's recall, arrest, prosecution or conviction\". </p> <p>They ruled that he had failed to make his concern known and had not formally applied to be treated as a conscientious objector before his arrest. Lord Justice Rix added that information to reservists could be improved, as it \"did not mention conscientious objection expressly\". </p> <p>But the call-up papers did sufficiently identify \"compassionate reasons\" as a relevant ground for objection. </p> <p>Mr Khan disappeared between February 24 and March 5 last year. The RAF punished him with the loss of nine days' pay and seven days' privileges. The sentence was upheld by the RAF's summary appeal court, which dismissed his argument that he had a right to conscientious objection and that such a right provided him with a defence to the charge against him. </p> <p>Lord Justice Rix said that well before the outbreak of war Mr Khan would have been fully entitled to apply for discharge under Queen's Regulations on the ground of conscientious objection. It remained \"mysterious\" why Mr Khan did not invoke the procedure. </p> <p>\"The RAF is plainly entitled to maintain a system of reservist recall, and to discipline those accepted back into service who go absent without leave, and do so prior to raising any question of conscientious objection,\" he said. </p> <p>On the facts of the case there could be no breach of his \"right to manifest his religion\" under article nine of the European convention on human rights by being arrested and \"very mildly punished\". </p> <p>The facts were that: \"He went absent without leave before any indication whatsoever of any conscientious objection, despite every opportunity of making his concerns known. </p> <p>\"Despite raising the issue in conversations during his absence, he never formally applied to be treated as a conscientious objector prior to his arrest, prosecution or at any relevant time\". </p> <p>Mr Khan said he was disappointed that the court did not allow his appeal outright, but was \"heartened that it agreed that the right of conscientious objection on religious grounds needed to be made clear in the legislation\". </p> <p>He said the case had been a matter of principle for him and \"in the light of the very high importance of this case for hundreds of thousands of UK Muslims I shall be seeking to take this further.\" </p> <p>The RAF said it was pleased with the judgment, and that the court had accepted the majority of its arguments. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> A Territorial Army soldier will be court martialled at Catterick in North Yorkshire on Monday on account of fake photographs published in the Daily Mirror which appeared to show British troops abusing an Iraqi, the Ministry of Defence said yesterday. </p> <p>Stuart MacKenzie, 25, from Haslingden in Lancashire, served in Iraq with the 1st Battalion, Queen's Lancashire Regiment.

  "Using the bathroom in an upmarket New York restaurant does not come cheap and diners often find themselves not so much spending a penny as spending a dollar - or more. <p>But any resentment at the fees charged by acquisitive bathroom attendants was tempered yesterday after it emerged that most are forced to pay \"rent\" for their high-value spot next to the urinals and to work without wages. </p> <p>Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney-general better known for his high-profile battles with organised crime and corrupt Wall Street bankers, yesterday turned his attentions to the glaring injustice, setting out his stall with a $4m (\u00a32.2m) lawsuit against Royal Flush, the city's main placement service for bathroom attendants. </p> <p>According to the complaint, the restroom orderlies, many of them immigrants, earn no wages or benefits but instead are forced to pay for the privilege of handing out small towels to total strangers. A \"lease fee\" is levied proportionate to the amount of tips they make simply for the right to work in the toilet. </p> <p>\"The idea of people working without wages and having to pay a fee to stand in a bathroom and wait for tips is unconscionable,\" Mr Spitzer said. The contracts were a \"clear violation\" of state labour law and \"deprived people of the dignity of the minimum wage\", he said. </p> <p>Attendants turning on taps, passing hand towels and dispensing colognes and mints are a common sight in the smarter city eateries. </p> <p>As a result of an investigation, Mr Spitzer's office said several restaurants had already agreed to hire people who had been working as attendants and, in some cases, would compensate them for unpaid wages. </p> <p>A settlement was reached with some of the best-known restaurants in the city, including Tavern on the Green in Central Park, Ruby Foo's in Times Square, Blue Water Grill, Dos Caminos, Atlantic Grill and Isabella's. </p> <p>The suit against Royal Flush and its managers, LeRoy Porter and Donna Williams, seeks $1.1m in damages and $2.9m in restitution for unpaid wages and unlawfully appropriated tips. The investigation was launched after the attorney-general's office received complaints from several workers.</p>",
  "<p>Tunde Baiyewu was in the final stages of an accountancy degree at the University of Northumbria when he met Paul Tucker and became the singer for the Lighthouse Family, one of the most successful purveyors of dinner party-friendly jazz-soul of the 90s. </p> <p>Baiyewu grew up in Lagos where his stepfather, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, ended 16 years of military rule by being voted into power in 1999, but it doesn't look like Baiyewu is set to follow in the family trade of nationwide leadership. He is about to release his solo album, which goes into a far deeper soul sound than The Lighthouse Family's music ever did. </p> <p>\"After the second Lighthouse Family record, I thought that we were treading water,\" says Baiyewu, a friendly, energetic man with a tendency to raise the volume of his stereo until nobody can talk, at which point he brings it down again. </p> <p>\"The lyrics for the Lighthouse Family were always very aspirational, and when my mother passed away four years ago I knew that I didn't want that way of looking at life. It wasn't enough for a song to say: 'It's all right, tomorrow will be a better day.' This record is the opposite of that: there is a song about my mother's passing, a song about breaking up with a girlfriend, and I'm not unique in having those experiences so hopefully people will relate to it.\" </p> <p>Baiyewu may well have no need for aspiration any more, of the material kind at least. He lives in a former clock tower in London that is something of a fantasy bachelor pad: the kitchen ceiling is about 20 feet high and a spiral staircase leads to a recording studio in the tower itself. Baiyewu is the perfect host, bringing in coffee and inviting us to play any number of his extremely rare vintage acoustic guitars, and he moves about the house with the air of a man not bothered about these things. </p> <p>\"When something like your mother's death happens, you evaluate your life and your work,\" he explains. \"And I wasn't getting on with Paul [Tucker] at the time because he wanted to carry on with the way things were and that didn't have much sense of reality for me. Suddenly there didn't seem any point in making a record with the goal of selling millions of copies anymore.\" </p> <p>After his mother died, Baiyewu started making regular trips to Lagos where he heard the African music that he had grown up with but long since forgotten about, including Fela Kuti and King Sunny Ade. The late Fela Kuti, who is now a people's hero in Nigeria, became a huge inspiration for the new record. The Kutis are one of the most eminent families in Lagos, with a number of famous doctors and professors in their ranks, but Fela was the rebellious one. </p> <p>\"Nigeria has gone through a lot of ups and downs politically - military rule, one coup d'etat after another - and Fela was the man who would stand up to the politicians,\" says Baiyewu. \"He was victimised as a result, and at one point the authorities burned his estate down, but people loved him for giving a voice to their grievances.\" </p> <p>Fela Kuti owned a legendary nightclub called the Shrine, where his band would play on most nights and the country's intellectuals, musicians and political dissidents could go to discuss the burning issues of the day, dance, and get extremely stoned. Baiyewu went there during his years at secondary school. </p> <p>\"I was friends with his son, Femi, who used to take us all there, and everyone would be smoking spliffs the size of that remote control,\" he says. \"It was great, but then I got expelled from school for being a twat and not doing my science subjects, so I had to go to a boarding school in the middle of nowhere. In retrospect, it was a good thing but I missed going to the Shrine and seeing Fela with his jumbo spliff, telling everyone what to do.\" </p> <p>Baiyewu spent the rest of his teenage years developing a fascination for the music that came from outside Nigeria. \"As a kid you want to get away from whatever is in front of you, so you worship the foreign. I loved Stevie Wonder, the Bar-Kays, and all the American soul people, and it wasn't until the last few years that I could come back and embrace what I truly am. In the mid-80s, the Nigerian government systematically destroyed the middle classes and the country was in a terrible way, with a few extremely rich people and then total poverty, so you dreamed of being somewhere else and music helped you do that. It was a country of extremes; that's why I hate extremes.\" </p> <p>Baiyewu's record collection certainly avoids extremes, being mostly made up of the kind of music that goes well with a tidy house and a comfortable pair of slippers. His favourite albums include Tumbleweed Connection by Elton John, the collected works of James Taylor, and anything by the bossa nova star Tom Jobim. </p> <p>There's plenty of soul from Stevie Wonder and Shuggie Otis, and albums by singers with unusually strong voices, including Donny Hathaway and Jeff Buckley. Soul star Hathaway committed suicide in 1979 aged 39, and Buckley drowned in 1998 aged 30. </p> <p>\"I met Jeff Buckley,\" says Baiyewu, as Buckley's album Grace blasts out of the speakers. \"In 1997 we were sitting in a caf\u00e9 in Los Angeles, and he looked just like he does on the album cover: moody and scruffy. He sat down on the table next to us and my manager told me who he was, saying that his father Tim was an amazing songwriter and so on. Jeff overheard the conversation and started shouting at us. He chilled out, and then he turned out to be a cool dude, just the kind of guy you wanted to know. I got back to the UK a year later and he had died.\"</p>",

So I am writing this now and will send it to someone I trust, to be read if something happens to me.\" </p> <p>Something did happen to him. Tom Hurndall, 21, a peace activist studying at Manchester Metropolitan University, was shot in the head trying to rescue children from Israeli gunfire in the Gaza Strip.

  "Allegations of serious shortcomings in the way the Catholic church in Scotland handles accusations of child abuse by its priests have been reported by the Catholic magazine the Tablet. <p>The allegations are apparently contained in a confidential 28-page report sent to the eight Scottish bishops this year by a non-Catholic lawyer who was briefly the director of the church's new child protection directorate. </p> <p>The magazine quoted May Dunsmuir as saying: \"Unacceptable levels of risk to children may have been and could remain present.\" </p> <p>Ms Dunsmuir left the post after three months when she was headhunted by another child agency. </p> <p>The report was said to allege that some bishops and priests had failed to understand the importance of making retrospective checks on clergy and others working with children, that one diocese had never offered any training in child protection, and that four others had offered no training in recent years. </p> <p>It claimed that cases involving allegations against priests had been closed when they ought to have been left open and that bishops and priests appeared to be unaware that they needed to comply with the 2003 Protection of Children Act, which requires organisations to report individuals found to have committed breaches of child protection. </p> <p>Last night a church spokesman said the magazine's report was unsubstantiated and based on \"misinformed speculation\". The Tablet could not have seen the report because it was confidential and had been sent only to the bishops. </p> <p>Alan Draper, a former adviser to the church on child protection, was quoted by the magazine as saying: \"Lots of bishops prefer to bury their heads in the sand and ignore what is going on around them. They seem unwilling to acknowledge the cases that have occurred, and to be open and honest about this problem with the laity, and even amongst themselves.\" </p> <p>Around the world the church has been accused by abuse victims of trying for many years to protect abusers and deny their activities, but it now faces huge legal bills and compensation claims in several countries for shielding wrongdoers. </p> <p>The Tablet maintained that it had seen a copy of the report with Ms Dunsmuir's initials on every page, but conceded that she had refused to speak to its reporter. </p> <p>It quoted the document as saying that to restore its reputation the church \"must embrace with compassion and insight the very great reality that children are being abused in Scotland. In certain cases this has been perpetrated by priests, religious brothers and sisters and care workers employed by the church\". </p> <p>The church spokesman said Ms Dunsmuir had parted on good terms with the bishops and they had been \"devastated\" to lose her expertise. Although she left in March, the church has still not appointed a successor. </p> <p>The Scottish church says it is implementing Ms Dunsmuir's recommendations. It would appoint a child protection adviser in each diocese and check with the Scottish Criminal Record Office all those working with children. </p> <p>Such measures fall short of the Nolan report recommendations being implemented by the church in England and Wales, which require the appointment of a child protection adviser in every parish. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Glasgow archdiocese said it did not regard any allegations of child abuse to be closed. </p> <p>\"Any member of the clergy so accused is under constant monitoring to ensure there is no risk to children.\"</p>",
  "George Monbiot accuses the government of failing to introduce new legislation on corporate manslaughter (Far too soft on crime, October 5). We are committed to tackling the difficulties that arise when prosecuting companies under the current law of manslaughter, and the home secretary confirmed at the Labour party conference last week that a draft bill setting out our proposals will be published this autumn. <p>Corporations which pay little regard to their responsibility of the safety of employees or others should face a specific and serious criminal offence. Our proposals will focus on circumstances where wider corporate failings in the overall management of a company have led to death, rather than the conduct of a particular individual. Where individuals are to blame, then the law already provides mechanisms for holding them to account, including prosecution for manslaughter or health and safety offences depending on the exact circumstances. <br> <b>Patricia Scotland</b> <br> Home Office minister </p> <p>George Monbiot states accurately the government's failure to deliver over the last seven years, and also the removing of any legal penalties for directors so that even if this much-promised bill is ever presented to parliament, it will be effectively neutered. </p> <p>While all of us as individuals are more likely to face manslaughter charges for negligent behaviour that kills, this government has bought the CBI arguments that, despite evidence of deaths to the contrary, directors in large firms can be trusted to behave themselves. Directors of small firms are fair game for prosecution and jail like the rest of us. </p> <p>The Health and Safety Commission, facing government cuts to the Health and Safety Executive budget, has taken the idea of \"faith-based\" policy-making, much beloved by this government, to new heights.

Kerry is tacking to the right of Bush, arguing that he will fight a tougher, smarter war, not that he will get America out of a wrong war.\"</p> <p>The <b>Washington Post</b>'s leader wants the candidates to debate the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13433-2004Oct6.html\">implications of the ISG report</a> for the future. \"The larger question is how, or even whether, decisions about pre-emptive war can be made in the absence of unambiguous intelligence. This is not hypothetical: whoever wins November's election may face a similar dilemma.</p> <p>\"The case of Iraq has shown that it is possible that the intelligence on which a war decision may be based may later prove to be mostly wrong. Does that mean the president cannot act in such cases? That's a question Mr Bush and Mr Kerry would do well to discuss.\"</p> <p>The <b>Houston Chronicle</b>, however, returns to the <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/editorial/2834757\">facts about prewar Iraq</a>. \"According to Duelfer and his report, Saddam ... intended to resume banned weapons programs whenever United Nations trade sanctions were lifted.

  "<p>Fahrenheit 9/11 looks set to become to most successful documentary ever released on video and DVD after selling around two million copies on its first day of release in the US. Michael Moore's much-discussed swipe at the Bush presidency is expected to sell another million copies by the end of the week, after hitting American shops on Tuesday. The DVD is released in the UK on October 18.</p> <p>Meanwhile, after being threatened with prosecution for offering underwear to college students to persuade them to vote, Moore has counter-attacked his Republican critics. In recent weeks, the film-maker and activist has been touring America urging college students and \"slackers\" to use their vote in the impending presidential election - with such joke prizes as noodles and clean underwear being offered up as bait.</p> <p>Republicans in Moore's home state of Michigan failed to see the funny side of the gag, however, and asked county prosecutors to file charges against Moore for violating electoral law.</p> <p>\"It's ironic that Republicans have no problem with allowing assault weapons out on our streets, yet they don't want to put clean underwear in the hands of our slacker youth,\" Moore said. \"The Republicans seem more interested in locking me up for trying to encourage people to participate in our democracy than locking up Bin Laden for his attacks on our democracy.\"</p>",
  "<p>I'm really beginning to worry about mobile games. I've played a heck of a lot of new ones over the past week or so, and I've noticed that very few developers seem willing to address the INTRINSIC LIMITATIONS of the mobile handset as a gaming device. Here is where I think things are going wrong\u2026</p> <p>For a start, many phones don't have joystick/direction pads, and those that do usually only offer four-way movement, so travelling diagonally is a no-no. Lots of games like Judge Dredd, Werewolf and FIFA 2005, do try to get around this problem by putting diagonal movement on the keypad, but this is a bit of a fudge in my opinion. I don't think I have fat fingers but when two or more digits hit the pad of my Nokia 6600 (not even a particularly small phone) genuine intuitive control over the game just falls apart. Should we perhaps be holding off on these games until phones with eight-way d-pads are commonplace? Or maybe not bother at all.</p> <p>Also, very few mobile handsets allow you to press more than one button at a time. This means that attempting everyday multi-tasking activities such as running and shooting, running and jumping, or in fact running and doing anything else whatsoever, are out of the question. When beset by enemies, it's unjust to expect a player to stop, shoot, and then continue running \u2013 and yet so many games require you to do just that.</p> <p>And don't even get me started on the limitations of J2ME, the mobile derivative of the Java programming language. If you've ever played a Java game you'll know what they are: 'music' that consists of little more than a few bleeps strung together into what can only be optimistically referred to as a tune, and animation that is often so sluggish you can make a cup of tea in the time it takes a bullet to reach it's intended target \u2013 on the other a screen that measure barely an inch and a half. Sun Microsystems is addressing the problem and many handsets now support a perkier new version of Java with lots more game-specific features, but I've yet to see many titles that exploit the benefits.</p> <p>Of course, this is the reason why so many people are still playing Space Invaders, Pac Man and Tetris on their phones. These games were designed with a simple interface in mind. They lose nothing in the translation to a limited mobile format. Okay, it's great that mobile phones are now on the multi-format checklist for many new releases, but publishers really need to think about how their franchises are realised on this emerging format. If this market is going to develop, mobile gamers needed to be treated with a little respect. There needs to be an understanding of the hardware.</p> <p>Ubisoft's relationship with mobile developer <a href=\"http://www.gameloft.com\">Gameloft</a> is a brilliant example of how it should be done. The mobile translation of Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow is a 2D platformer \u2013 Gameloft hasn't tried to mimic the 3D visuals of the title's console counterparts. And yet the essence of the gameplay \u2013 sneaking about in the shadows, working out how to takedown enemies with as little fuss or noise as possible, solving mini-puzzles strewn throughout the locations \u2013 are all present. The pace is perfect too. When you arrive on a new screen, you're very rarely in immediate danger. You get time to analyse the movement patterns of enemies and figure out how you can get to them without being seen. Speed and lightning responses are not integral elements of the game dynamic so the sluggishness of the animation is never really an issue.</p> <p>And of course there are plenty of new, original mobile games that understand and work within the limits of the technology. Just about everything that <a href=\"http://www.morpheme.co.uk/\">Morpheme</a> creates is worth playing, because the company makes simple, funny, bright games with lots of decent ideas \u2013 the sort of games that built the home computer entertainment industry of the early eighties. Check out Balloon-Headed Boy or Phantom Mansion and you'll see what I mean. In today's Online section of the Guardian I rave about <a href=\"http://www.sumea.com/\">Sumea</a>'s Jumbo Rumble, a laughably dumb multiplayer elephant battle game which allows three players to take part simultaneously on one handset. Brilliant.</p> <p>By getting ahead of itself and constantly outpacing the hardware, the mobile games industry is in real danger of completely alienating its audience forever. I mean, it's hard enough to actually download games without making them impossible to play, too. Vodafone Live! And the O2 Games Arcade are very good, but often mobile users aren't sure how much they're paying for the game, or where it'll download to on their handset, or if the title in question is actually compatible with their phone anyway. At least the major network operators are trying to make things as simple as possible - and with 3G set to launch over the next few months they really need to. They know (or at least <em>hope</em>) there's going to be big money in multimedia downloads \u2013 games, video, music \u2013 when this faster, slicker service is fully operational. They know they have to get things right.</p> <p>But somehow things aren't quite right. Not yet. The mobile handset is getting pulled in all sorts of directions that it doesn't want to go in. 3D gaming? It'll arrive next year, and companies like ATI and nVidia are working on specialist 3D chipsets for the latest handsets. But I know that when these phones arrive, developers will immediately become too ambitious, attempting to jam in all the latest special effects, rather than sitting down and thinking, \"okay, how can we use 3D visuals to really offer something new in terms of mobile gameplay? And should we perhaps start with flat-shaded polys before barging in with alpha blending, environment-mapping and multi-layered textures?\"</p> <p>I want to see more games that use the unique capabilities of mobiles, rather than games that try and ignore the limitations. Last year UK developer <a href=\"http://www.macrospace.com\">Macrospace</a> launched Cannons ME an over-the-air two-player combat game allowing users from around the country to engage in tank warfare. This year, it is launching several more two-player games inviting you to hook up with strangers and play across the phone networks. French company <a href=\"http://in-fusio-games.com/\">Infusio</a> is doing a similar thing via its ExEn platform. There have also been several Bluetooth compatible games (Bluetooth Biplanes, Pat Cash Tennis, Fatal Force) that let players in close proximity engage in two-player bouts. These really focus in on the intrinsic social connotations of the mobile phone.</p> <p>I also like camera phone games like <a href=\"http://www.elkware.com/\">Elkware</a>'s Photo Pet where you have to feed your onscreen creature by taking photographs of specific colours. It's an idea that originated in Japan where clever game concepts that could only be realised on mobile phones are common. You may well have heard of the mobile fishing game that uses location-based technology to discover where the user is and then changes the in-game weather and time of day to match the real world environment. Then there is the burgeoning world of the location-based game which allows participants to turn cities into game levels. <a href=\"http://www.botfighters.com/\">Botfighters</a> for example.</p> <p>But of course for western mobile developers \u2013 who do not have an audience so receptive to quirky ideas - it's easier and less of a gamble to hook up with a nice console conversion job - to try and squeeze a PS2 title onto as large a range of handsets as possible. It's classic short-term thinking and it is leading to a stunted industry. Let's face it, trying to accurately replicate console titles can, by definition, only ever lead to a diminished gameplay experience. Look at Game Boy Advance \u2013 some of its poorest titles are conversions of PS2, Xbox and Game Cube bestsellers. Its best are titles like WarioWare \u2013 designed specifically with GBA in mind.</p> <p>Most gamers find it hard to take mobile games seriously. I find it hard to blame them a lot of the time. But then when I'm playing crazy stuff like Balloon-Headed Boy I realise that mobile developers don't <em>need</em> to seduce gamers. They have a mass entertainment device on their hands \u2013 there could be two billion mobile phone users in the world by 2006. What is needed are ideas that will capture the imagination of the typical non-gaming phone owner. Those ideas won't come from slavishly converting inappropriate games to a platform that isn't designed to handle them. These ideas will come when designers start to think about the unique properties of the mobile format. And when someone does hit upon a truly mass entertainment mobile phone experience, you can forget about the impact made by Space Invaders, or Tetris, or Doom, or Pokemon or The Sims. They'll be blasted away. I believe that - even now while I'm struggling to achieve diagonal movement on a simple footie sim. I believe it, but I'm still worried.</p>",
  "<p>Workers are now first in line to be sued over an accident or disaster because of \"botched\" legislation, it was claimed today. </p> <p>Under health and safety regulations, bad employers can now pass the buck to their staff after any workplace accident, according to whistleblowing charity Public Concern at Work. </p> <p>The regulations, introduced a year ago with no publicity, mean that workers face having to pay unlimited damages if they don't raise concerns about health and safety risks, said the report. </p> <p>The group claimed that if the regulations had been in place for the Potters Bar train crash two years ago, the worker who inspected the track weeks before the incident would have been made the \"statutory fall guy\". </p> <p>Public Concern at Work director Guy Dehn said: \"It's unacceptable that such a far-reaching and radical new law can be introduced with no publicity and without even a word of advice or guidance to those it affects.\" </p> <p>The report warned that insurance premiums and legal costs could rocket for businesses, even though the law targeted workers. </p> <p>\"This is because safety chiefs and ministers ducked the key issue whether employers or employees should insure this new liability, leaving the matter to the courts,\" said Mr Dehn. </p> <p>The Government was urgently considering the matter, according to Public Concern at Work.</p>",
  "<p> Last year saw anonymous weblogs hit the headlines. Salam Pax brought the world an insider's view of Iraq, while Belle de Jour racked up readers with the salacious diaries of a London call girl. Thanks in part to these secretive success stories, anonymous weblogs - which offer readers a real-time connection to hidden, dangerous and often taboo worlds - are a feature of online life. </p> <p>Now a new group of anonymous webloggers has emerged en masse, but this time they are covering more mundane territory. Job blogs bring frontline news from the modern workplace, documenting its stupid routines, petty frustrations and inane management-speak. </p> <p>Call Centre Confidential was perhaps the first to gain real recognition - it did well in last year's Guardian weblog awards - and has proved an inspiration to others. Now Wrapstar's regular posts about call centre life have been joined by blogs taking readers behind the scenes at schools (The Report Card), NHS trusts (Doing Less Harm) and police stations (The Policeman's Blog). </p> <p>There are blogs by burger flippers (Diary of a Fast Food Life) and supermarket shelf stackers (My Life as a Morrison's Employee). Natural Born Liars does its best to confirm clients' worst fears about what ad agency employees do with their money, while Bitch PhD is by a university academic who admits not having read some of the texts she teaches - as well as offering a blow by blow account, as it were, of her open marriage. </p> <p>Most job bloggers seem to see their sites as a \"place to vent\", somewhere to work off the irritations and upsets of the daily grind. Diary of a Fast Food Life is \"a great outlet for the more irritating aspects of my job, for example, things which I couldn't directly say to customers\", says the author, JT. Others are trying to work out larger concerns. Professor B, who writes Bitch PhD, uses her blog \"to work out my incredible anxieties over my academic identity, and to put those anxieties out there in a public forum because a lot of people feel them\". According to Doc, the writer behind Doing Less Harm, his blog grew out of swapping funny stories with NHS work colleagues. \"Someone once said to me that mine were always the funniest and that I had a knack for storytelling.\" </p> <p>Over the past two decades, people have used \"personal media\" to document their working lives. In the 1980s, fanzines such as Processed World and Temp Slave featured personal rants about office boredom. These spread online via early webzines such as Disgruntled Employee. However, job blogs have ditched politics for a more individual focus. </p> <p>Most job bloggers see their sites as primarily personal, but - maybe because many of them write about public services - they can't help but have a larger significance. Perhaps job blogs represent a kind of low-level whistle blowing: while they may not expose corporate crimes, they do shine a light on stupidity. JT, of Fast Food Life, agrees. \"If visitors read my blog and think they would never want to work in a fast food place, decide to be more polite when dealing with staff in service industries, and think they should eat more healthily, I'd consider that an achievement.\" </p> <p>Others are more wary. \"I just wanted to narrow the gap between the public's perception of what we do all day and what we actually do all day,\" says the author of the Policeman's Blog, who writes as Dave Campbell. \"I've commented on issues facing the police but I try to do it from the perspective of someone who just deals with the system as it is, rather than someone who has some master plan for police reform.\" </p> <p>You could argue that job blogs are a way of kicking back against our overwork culture. As people work longer hours, blogging is a way of wasting a little time and claiming back some mental space. It's a way of dealing with office stress by taking control and making work \"your story\" - a comedy in which the blogger has the starring role and all the best lines. </p> <p>Call Centre Confidential's Wrapstar isn't convinced. \"Generations of my family worked down a pit to feed their kids; these days people may worry 'does my boss rate me?' and work through their lunch shuffling their inbox, but it's to keep their kids in DVDs. Get a grip.\" Others remain similarly unimpressed. A large number of job bloggers said they really enjoy their jobs, but what does upset them is idiocy at work. On Doing Less Harm, Doc has railed about his NHS trust spending \"thousands of pounds on getting a new logo when there are wards where eight nurses have to share one PC, which is locked in the sister's office\". </p> <p>Exposing management stupidity could have serious consequences, which is why job bloggers remain anonymous. Even if you focus more on the idiocies of the media or politicians than your direct boss, blogging from the office can be risky. Worries about getting caught led British Spin, the blogger behind British Politics, to start sending out his political musings via email. \"As the blog got more popular, updating it as frequently as a news and current affairs site needs to be, interfered with my real work. Also, I felt unhappy that blogging at work drives you to a shorter and shorter writing style - I wanted to write thoughtful things and ended up posting one-liners with a link.\" </p> <p>Job bloggers may post from the safety of their own homes, but their readers are often logging on while still at work. For Bitch PhD's Professor B, such readers are working through their worries. We work longer hours and increasingly identify ourselves with our jobs, she says. \"But at the same time people don't think their jobs are permanent any more. That creates an enormous amount of stress and anxiety, and I think people are trying to work out that conflict.\" </p> <p>As readers identify with job bloggers, many seem to trust that what they say is true. Are they right to do so? After all, some could easily be clever hoaxes. Clearly, they all change names and places to avoid being found out, but regular readers often build up a kind of relationship that enables them to assess how seriously to take them. Some writers admit to tweaking certain stories to make them funnier. \"Call Centre Confidential is more honest than true,\" says Wrapstar. \"The things that happen do happen, but not necessarily in the right order. My motivation is to entertain. I'm never going to let the truth get in the way, and I have made it clear: given the choice between the truth and the legend, I'll print the joke.\" </p> <p>But others say that while they do not consider themselves journalists, they feel a responsibility to tell it like it is. \"My blog is the truth. It's not embellished,\" says Mr Teacher. \"If something happens at work, I try to find a quiet place (usually the toilet) to write it down, including exact quotes. The media only cares about sensational things that will improve their rating. Blogs like mine are personal accounts from people who have nothing to gain, which is what I think the public want nowadays.\" </p> <p>Erwin James, who is not a blogger but writes a pseudonymous Guardian column about prison life, believes trust is vitally important to anonymous writers. </p> <p>\"For me, it was an opportunity to talk about reality,\" he says. \"It had to be honest, it had to be real, it had to be true. But I also had to protect people, particularly those I harmed 20 years ago. But there are problems with anonymous writing on the internet; it always depends on context.\" </p> <p>Imagine, for example, if a whistleblower decided to use the web to reveal their secrets. How long could they remain anonymous? Last year, GCHQ worker Katherine Gunn told the Observer that the intelligence services had been bugging the United Nations. But what would have happened if she had chosen a weblog to get her message across? </p> <p>Even if such a story were picked up by more mainstream media, it seems unlikely that anyone would give the information credit without demanding an identity behind the source.Despite writing under a pseudonym, Erwin James agrees with the sceptics. </p> <p>\"Ironically, I'm suspicious of people who write anonymously,\" he says. \"I can rationalise why I do it, but I wonder what other people are hiding.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the responsibility job bloggers feel most is to themselves. Paradoxically, that may mean some readers trust them as much, if not more, than big media outlets. </p> <p>\"Face it,\" says Mr Teacher of The Report Card. \"We all have problems where we work, so I think that people like reading about others' problems and can relate to them.\" </p> <p><strong>LINKS</strong></p> <p><strong>Call Centre Confidential</strong><br> <a href=\"http://callcentrediary.blogspot.com\">callcentrediary.blogspot.com</a><br> <strong>The Report Card</strong><br> <a href=\"http://thereportcard.blogspot.com\">thereportcard.blogspot.com</a><br> <strong>Doing Less Harm</strong><br> <a href=\"http://anytownnhstrust.blogspot.com\">anytownnhstrust.blogspot.com</a><br> <strong>The Policeman's Blog</strong><br> <a href=\"http://coppersblog.blogspot.com\">coppersblog.blogspot.com</a><br> <strong>Diary of a Fast Food Life</strong><br> <a href=\"http://fast-life.blogspot.com\">fast-life.blogspot.com</a><br> <strong>My Life as a Morrison's Employee</strong><br> <a href=\"http://morrisons-employee.blogspot.com\">morrisons-employee.blogspot.com</a><br> <strong>Natural Born Liars</strong><br> <a href=\"http://theadvertisingagency.blogspot.com\">theadvertisingagency.blogspot.com</a><br> <strong>British Politics</strong><br> <a href=\"http://britishspin.blogspot.com\">britishspin.blogspot.com</a><br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send comment to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@theguardian.com\"> online.feedback@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>Australia's bowlers tore into India's much-vaunted batting line-up order in Bangalore, taking complete control after a huge sixth-wicket partnership between the debutant Michael Clarke and captain Adam Gilchrist propelled the Aussies to 474.</p> <p>That was the cue for the inevitable Glenn McGrath to silence the doubters yet again; he took three wickets, including the star man Rahul Dravid for 0, as India closed on 150 for six - still 125 away from avoiding the follow-on.</p> <p>Clarke and Gilchrist picked up where they left off overnight, facing down the raucous Indian home support to put together a partnership of 167 before Gilchrist fell in the final over before lunch for 104 to an impressive diving one-handed catch by Harbhajan Singh off his own bowling.</p> <p>Clarke, having betrayed his emotion on reaching a debut century with a triumphant throwing up of his arms and a kiss for his baggy green cap and bat, went on to record a further 40 runs after lunch before finally being caught behind off the bowling of Zaheer Khan. His brilliant 151 was the highest-ever score by an Australian debutant on foreign soil.</p> <p>It was also the sixth-best return for an Australian debutant anywhere. Charles Bannerman leads the way with the unbeaten 165 he made against England in Melbourne in 1877 - the first Test match ever played. When Clarke eventually did fall midway through the afternoon session, he had hit 18 fours and four sixes.</p> <p>Clarke's dismissal served to finally break Australian resistance, with the visitors managing just three further runs for their final two wickets, as Harbhajan dismissed Michael Kasprowicz (3) and McGrath (0) in quick succession to round out the innings.</p> <p>Harbhajan at least could take some pride from the innings: he ended with figures of five for 146 - his 12th five-wicket haul in his 37th Test match.</p> <p>Indian hopes for a strong response from their batsmen took an early blow as both Akash Chopra and Dravid went for a duck, both to McGrath deliveries, as the home side fell to 4 for two.</p> <p>Virender Sehwag and Sourav Ganguly did their best to steady a situation that was threatening to spiral out of control for the home side. Sehwag recorded a solid 39 before falling to a Justin Langer catch at mid-wicket off Michael Kasprowicz; he was quickly followed by Ganguly (45), who snicked Kasprowicz through to Gilchrist. </p> <p>McGrath picked his third wicket of the day as the disappointing Yuvraj Singh attempted to play away from his body outside off stump and was caught once more by the alert Gilchrist.</p> <p>VVS Laxman was the next to fall, as Shane Warne - who Laxman took to the cleaners on Australia last tour here three years ago - ripped his off stump with a glorious delivery that flew past the batsman's attempted defensive jab, leaving India struggling massively to make up the deficit at 136 for 6.</p> <p>India are undoubtedly in big trouble and, short of a miraculous performance to rival that of Clarke, the home side look set for a dramatic and humiliating defeat here.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> I just don't get the Tories. An iron rule of British politics is never to repeat Labour's \"suicide note\" election campaign of 1983. Its high point was the pledge to renegotiate Britain's treaty with its European partners. Opinion polls in the early 1980s showed more hostility to Brussels than they do today. But voters knew that isolating Britain from Europe makes no sense. Instead they overwhelmingly endorsed Mrs Thatcher, even though she and her cabinet were united on taking Britain deeper and deeper into Europe via the Single European Act. So why does Michael Howard want to be a Tory Benn and lead the UK to the exit door of Europe? All private Labour discussion has insisted on the non-salience of Europe as a doorstep issue. I think that is right. So why has Michael Howard made anti-EU stridency such a top Tory issue? <p><b>\u00b7</b> I know Paul Sykes. He made his first fortune in the Meadowhall shopping centre 10 minutes from my house in Rotherham. We have debated Europe over the years in Yorkshire. He is strongly anti-Europe which is his perfect right. He also has millions to spend on politics as play and flits between anti-EU Tories and other outfits that are more stridently Europhobe. William Hague thought he had his support but then Paul gave the UK Independence party shedloads. Before that it was the people linked to the late Jimmy Goldsmith. In 1983, he would have given money to Labour because of the party's anti-European manifesto. But the vast bulk of Yorkshire businesses know that the Tory-Ukip line Mr Sykes supports would mean the UK would instantly be in breach of all its solemn treaty obligations, which would mean either massive fines or quitting the EU.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> If we follow Michael Howard and repudiate our treaty obligations, business would be the first to suffer. Our competitors in Europe would be laughing all the way to the bank. From protectionist airlines that would like to shut down Easyjet, Ryanair and Jet2.com flights to all the energy and financial service companies that would shelter behind EU rules to the detriment of UK business, who would have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels to ask permission to trade in Europe. No more common agricultural policy payments for farmers. No more E111 forms for medical treatment on holiday. An end to the 28 days' paid holiday for British workers. No more pressure to clean up beaches and rivers. No voice at the World Trade Organisation to protect UK steel companies against illegal US protectionism. Those are just some of the consequences of following the John Redwood and Paul Sykes line. Is this really what today's Conservatives believe in? Ukip are to the Tories what Militant was to Labour. Tory Bennism just does not make sense.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> At the Labour conference in Brighton, I enjoyed a wonderful fringe debate with Mr Redwood on Europe. I know he is Vulcan and single-handedly destroyed the Major government. But in the flesh he is an easy, at times almost shy intellectual whose writing output is phenomenal. So I cannot help liking this Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, replete with company directorships, who is obsessed with Europe. He is so extravagant, excited and extreme in his dislike of the EU that I find myself almost carried away by his rhetoric. He denounces the common foreign policy with vim and venom and portrays Britain losing control over its foreign policy to the machinations of Brussels. Alas, I am one of those sad people who has read the treaty many times and gently point out that he has omitted to read the most important clause which stipulates that any common foreign policy position has to be adopted \"unanimously.\" In other words, Malta or Luxembourg or Latvia can veto any policy that Britain and 23 other EU member states wish to adopt. Such, such are the prosaic joys of the new treaty but Mr Redwood needs to live in his fantasy world in which Britain is about to be submerged by Europe. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Our conference ends on a high with the byelection victory in Hartlepool. Twenty years ago, Roy Jenkins and David Marquand vacated safe Labour seats to go and work in Brussels. Both were lost to the Conservatives. Today, Michael Howard's party comes fourth. The Guardian urges Hartlepool voters to support the Lib Dems but there is an ever growing gap between the London intelligentsia and the real Britain. To be sure, after seven years of government, the luvvies' affair with Labour is over. But there is a respect that this is a serious government trying to do serious things. The Tories are now so far to the right they make George Bush's Republicans and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia look centrist, almost liberal. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> What baffles me as the political season re-opens is the drift of the Lib Dems to the right. Their Orange Book is quasi-Thatcherite with its insistence on privatising the NHS, or shutting down the big-ticket UK ship industry by suggesting our aircraft carriers should be built in America. Clock towers sometimes have four faces but the Lib Dems? There is also a new ugly \"Get tough with Europe\" tone pitched for the Rothermere press readership. Hmm, I wonder. There was a lot of tactical voting in 1997 and 2001 in favour of Lib Dems in places like Sheffield Hallam, Richmond and Kingston in order to keep the Tories out. But if the Lib Dems keep going in for blue rinses why will voters not vote for the real thing? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I read the anti-European rants from Tory-Ukip politicians en route to the Netherlands. (By the way, Richard Corbett MEP has produced a magnificent expose of Ukip's racist, anti-semitic, homophobic and extreme-right roots. Get it from <a href=\"http://www.britainineurope.org.uk/\">Britain in Europe</a>.) At a conference in Amsterdam of European ministers from the 25 member states as well as Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Turkey, it becomes clear that the new Europeans look to Britain for leadership and support in shaping a Europe that allows them to escape from their old European nightmares and build a 21st century Europe that allows history to be a blessing rather than a curse on these great nations and their peoples. They are all in favour of the new treaty which enshrines new powers for national parliaments and new authority for the nation states of Europe. As in the past, Britain will have to decide to be a partner and ally of the Poles, Czechs, Hungarians and so on or to retreat into self-indulgent isolationism. I hope we do not led down our new friends in Europe. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Hooray. The commission has said yes to Turkey's bid for EU membership negotiations. Tough years of talks lie ahead. But if we get it right - a European Turkey of Muslim faith living by the secular democratic values of Europe - we can change an entire region. How I wish Tories like Boris Johnson who like me supports Turkey's European aspirations could be part of a common British campaign to help them. But while so many countries want to join the EU, Boris's Spectator promotes the Tory-Ukip line that Britain would be better off detached from Europe. Bizarre, quite bizarre.</p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> In France, a great debate has broken out over the new constitutional treaty. The French are clear: it is a treaty. It does not begin \"We, the people ...\" but rather \"The King of the Belgians, the President of the Czech Republic..\" and so on. Like the WTO or Nato, the Law on the Sea or any one of dozens of treaties by which Britain pools some of its sovereignty and agrees to live under common rules and systems of arbitration, the EU constitutional treaty is no more, and no less, than a treaty. I tell John that we have added a special clause just for him allowing any member state to withdraw if they like. But on and on he goes about loss of democracy and unelected Brussels Eurocrats. Last time I checked I did not elect the governor of the Bank of England, the heads of the regulatory authorities, or the director of the WTO, all of whom impact on my daily life. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> It is a debate that will go on and on. But all honour to Mr Redwood for coming to Brighton. Most anti-Europeans are sturdy British patriots who love their country. But patriotism is not enough - British interests need to be defended. And saying no to Europe - the politics of isolationism throughout the ages - is a denial of the true, deep, enduring patriotic case for Britain being leader in shaping the Europe of the 21st century. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Denis MacShane is minister for Europe and Labour</p>",

  "Michael Howard today made a bold appeal for disillusioned Labour voters to \"come and join us\" as he closed the Conservative party conference - his first as party leader and probably the last before a general election. <p>Publishing his \"timetable for action\" - a programme of policies for the first hours, days and months of a new Tory administration - Mr Howard claimed he would form a government \"generous in spirit and competent in action\".</p> <p>And, ignoring the threat from the Liberal Democrats, he used his final address to delegates in Bournemouth to make a direct call to voters: \"So to those who voted Labour last time, who dream of a better life, who work hard but feel let down, I say, come and join us.\"</p> <p>Speaking to the media before his second, and final, speech of the conference, he insisted the general election was \"there to be won\". </p> <p>But he ducked questions over whether he would quit if he lost the election. He said he was accountable to the party and it was up to members to decide his position. </p> <p>He has told the conference Tory ministers would be sacked if they failed to deliver on their promises. </p> <p>Asked if Margaret Thatcher should have sacked him from her cabinet over the poll tax, he conceded the policy was a mistake but sought to distance himself from it. </p> <p>\"The poll tax was a policy for which many people were responsible,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>\"I was responsible for taking the legislation through parliament. It was a mistake, of course it was a mistake. I have apologised for it.\" </p> <p>The Tory leader again refused to commit to cutting taxes. </p> <p>\"It is because we are being so rigorous that I am not taking the easy path and making immediate promises about tax cuts, because I am not yet certain that we could deliver on those promises,\" he said. </p> <p>In an earlier question and answer session with the retired broadcaster Sir Michael Brunson, Mr Howard admitted that \"I don't think we always used our time in opposition as well as we should\", and a confessed he had not originally wanted to return to frontline politics.</p> <p>He told delegates that after leaving William Hague's frontbench he only returned under Iain Duncan Smith because of the number of complaints from constituents about the NHS - which he claimed numbered more in two years under Labour than in 17 years under the Tories.</p> <p>He said: \"I hadn't been intending to [come back to the frontbench] but I got very angry about what was happening to the NHS in my constituency.\"</p> <p>Just as for his formal speech on Tuesday, Mr Howard was serenaded in and out of the conference hall to the stirring chords of Elgar's Nimrod.</p> <p>Party chairman, Dr Liam Fox, sending delegates on their way, praised party unity.</p> <p>He said: \"This is more focused and more disciplined than any conference in recent years - and that comes from one man, Michael Howard.\"</p> <p>Dr Fox also claimed there had not been so much \"content and clarity\" at a Tory party conference since 1986, when the party under Margaret Thatcher and Norman Tebbit launched their \"Next Moves Forward\" proposals which helped win the 1987 election.</p> <p>The timetable for action document makes commitments ranging from cutting police paperwork and raising the state pension to tightening immigration controls. </p> <p>Copies of the document were handed out to representatives at the conference, as Mr Howard and some of the shadow cabinet left to go campaigning in the nearby marginal constituency of Mid-Dorset and North Poole.</p> <p>Some 11m copies of a leaflet version of the document will be sent to homes across the country, with Mr Howard and his shadow cabinet team distributing the first handful of copies to voters today. </p> <p>It promised that, after coming to office, the Tories would: <br><b>\u00b7</b> Within the first hour, remove political advisers' power over civil servants and make the Office of National Statistics independent.<br><b>\u00b7</b> Within the first day, freeze civil service recruitment, set a date for a referendum on the EU constitution, abolish Whitehall targets for hospitals and appoint a minister for homeland security to coordinate action against terrorism. <br><b>\u00b7</b> Within the first week, end the early release scheme for prisoners, free schools to expand, halt proposed cuts in the armed forces and order the publication of hospital superbug infection rates. <br><b>\u00b7</b> Within the first month, introduce 24-hour surveillance at entry ports, restore the link between state pensions and earnings, start a prison-building programme and a 5,000-a-year police recruitment drive and launch an audit of speed cameras to weed out those that are unnecessary. </p> <p>A Tory chancellor's first budget would include a timetable to cut billions of pounds from Whitehall bureaucracy and \"set Britain on the path to lower taxes\". </p> <p>A programme of legislation will be set out to introduce a right to choose in education and health, allow Housing Association tenants to buy their own homes, abolish student fees, introduce a points system for immigrants, require drug-addicted criminals to choose between treatment or prison and free hospitals from central control. </p> <p><b>Reactions</b><br></p> <p>Delegates streaming out of the conference hall passed their verdict on the week.</p> <p>Kulveer Ranger, from Hounslow, said: \"This is my first conference and I've been very, very impressed. A lot of people have said there's a strong buzz about the place and it definitely has been all the way through. Michael Howard has rounded it off brilliantly.</p> <p>\"We have a very, very good chance of winning the next general election if we maintain the momentum we've had this week and get the message across. It's testament to what Liam Fox has done.\"</p> <p>Richard Andrews, a councillor on Medway borough council, said: \"It was one of the best conferences I've been to. It was completely different, with much less showmanship and much more work done. I did feel it got the message across.</p> <p>\"I think our chances at the next election are a lot better than people think they are.</p> <p>Another delegate, Helen Wheeler from Coventry, gave her verdict: \"Really upbeat. The surge of people really wanting to change and make a difference - it is almost got to a critical point now in this country where people want Tony Blair to go. </p> <p>\"We are on a roll and we have to gain the trust again. I understand the people felt out of faith with us. We have to prove again that we can earn their trust.\"</p> <p>James Sproule, prospective parliamentary candidate for Streatham, said: \"It has been a lot better than I expected. A lot of people were a bit depressed about the Tory party last week. </p> <p>\"The media has been negative about us but when it came to it we found there's a lot more on policy and I think the media has found that too.

  "<p>Mercury Prize-winners Franz Ferdinand will curate an evening of music as part of this year's Frieze art fair, which opens in Regent's Park next week. The evening, entitled the Chateau after the Glasgow artists' collective that the band co-founded, will be at the Scala in London on October 18. Featured acts will include blues rock two-piece the Kills and Leeds popsters the Kaiser Chiefs. \"Coming from an art background, Frieze is something the band understand,\" says Frieze director Amanda Sharp. </p> <p>The five-day Frieze art fair was launched last year, when it attracted more than 28,000 visitors. It is the capital's only major contemporary art fair. Sharp describes the music programme as one of the event's many \"differentiating characteristics. Other art fairs simply don't have music programmes.\" </p> <p>One hundred and forty of the world's leading contemporary art galleries will be present at this year's fair, including new arrivals from Moscow, Beijing and Melbourne. There will be several specially commissioned projects, including British artist Adam Chodzko's Night Shift, which sees him host a carnival of ani mals and insomniacs overnight in the Frieze tent, then create maps based on the paths they tread. South American artists Los Super Elegantes host Slow Dance Club, which will turn the Frieze tent into a location for \"momentary intimacy between strangers\". </p> <p>To Sharp, such activities are what the Frieze fair, in which the Guardian is a media partner, is all about. \"Of course,\" she says, \"the fair will stand or fall on whether we cover costs and whether the art sells. But we also want the fair to generate new art, and to invite people to learn about contemporary art.\"</p>",
  "<p>The chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, announced new measures today to tackle the rising number of tuberculosis cases in Britain, including plans for higher rates of vaccination of the groups thought to be most at risk.</p> <p>Sir Liam said his action plan would eventually eradicate TB, despite figures showing that Britain was the only country in Europe where the number of people contracting the disease had risen in the last 10 years.</p> <p>He promised quicker and more effective screening of high-risk groups - mostly those living in inner-city areas, with London accounting for two in every five TB cases.</p> <p>Other measures he announced included DNA bacterial fingerprinting to track the spread of TB, which has increased in England by 25% in the last 10 years, and wider use of digital x-ray vans which can screen people close to where they live.</p> <p>Sir Liam said: \"In our battle against tuberculosis, the disease has regained the upper hand. Identifying the high-risk groups early, ensuring effective treatment for them and using modern laboratory techniques to track the disease are all vital control measures. </p> <p>\"Experience elsewhere has shown that the march of TB can be halted.</p> <p>\"Our long-term goal is to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, TB in this country,\" he said.</p> <p>Tuberculosis is a contagious airborne bacterial respiratory disease causing severe lung problems. It can be present without causing any symptoms until a person becomes run-down or their immune system becomes lowered. </p> <p>More than 6,000 people were newly diagnosed with TB in England in 2002, representing 13 cases for every 100,000 people. Around 350 people die in England each year from the disease. </p> <p>Seven out of every 10 cases involved people from ethnic minorities, and nearly two thirds were born abroad.</p> <p>The British Thoracic Society (BTS) said that the plan would have little impact unless extra staff and funding were provided. </p> <p>While Dr Richard Russell, from the BTS, called the plan a \"positive step forward\", he also said that he hoped it would be met with the allocation of further resources. </p> <p>\"To make the action plan work, the NHS needs an additional 40 specialist doctors supported by 100 specialist nurses with the right equipment to do their job properly,\" he said.</p>",
  "He was the reason I could never truly feel British and he epitomised everything I detested about the Thatcher years. In an administration generously staffed by villains, he was easily the most loathsome. Margaret Thatcher's hard man, the Chingford skinhead, the Count Dracula of the Conservative party: he was Norman Tebbit and I hated him. <p>I hated him for many things - for telling the unemployed to get on their bikes, for the union- bashing and the BBC-baiting - but mainly I despised him for having coined the Tebbit test. It was the spring of 1990 when, in an interview with the LA Times, he suggested that a test of the loyalty of British Asians was who they supported in cricket: if they did not cheer for England, he implied, their allegiance to Britain was suspect. It was hugely provocative. In effect he was saying that if you were not with us, then you were against us. </p> <p>No wonder Tebbit became such a hate figure for so many. For young British Asians like me, who failed his cricket test, he provoked fear and revulsion. Just as my father's generation had been taunted by Enoch Powell, I was terrified of Tebbit. I also wondered what he might say if I could talk to him directly. Would he be as cold and offensive if I could speak to him face to face? But what were the chances then of facing Tebbit? None. </p> <p>Finally, however, I got my chance. While making a film for Channel 4, I requested an interview with Lord Tebbit, as he is now, and to my surprise he agreed. And so I find myself in the London Marriott hotel, formerly County Hall, sitting opposite the man who had so frightened me all those years ago. </p> <p>The first surprise is how harmless he looks. With his smart tweed jacket and black trousers, bifocals and silver hair he seems less the monster of my youth, and more what he is today: a frail 73-year-old. The second surprise was the softness of his voice. He speaks in the quiet, level tone of someone willing to listen. He smiles easily and often. </p> <p>But although being out of frontline politics may have mellowed him, that does not absolve him of his past, and it is that past I wanted to discuss with him. </p> <p>He was born in Enfield and was a journalist and pilot before entering politics 34 years ago. Unlike many of his blander contemporaries in the Thatcher administration - Tom King, Kenneth Baker - Tebbit's public image was spiky and steely: the satirical puppet programme Spitting Image depicted him as an Essex skinhead. \"In politics you are lucky to be remembered for anything,\" he tells me. \"At least I have survived. </p> <p>\"The most interesting thing about the cricket test was that it was an almost throwaway remark made 14 years ago and people are still talking about it.\" </p> <p>What those remarks were about and how they were interpreted are, he claims, two separate things. \"I was talking about the problems of multiculturalism and my remark was about how you tell if people are being integrated,\" he says. \"I felt irritated that most of them were born here but that they had not got used to the idea that they were British and I found that hard to take.\" </p> <p>For Tebbit, the responsibility for integration lay with the immigrant communities. Those who came to this country ought not to try to change where they had come to into a version of what they had left behind. I have sympathy for that argument, but what Tebbit failed to appreciate was that our ambivalence towards Britain was partly due to the actions and statements of his own government. What was the point of declaring that we were British when the prime minister had herself voiced concerns that the country was being swamped by immigrants? </p> <p>So while Tebbit's observation about cricket was accurate he did not realise that for many he was the reason why we found it so hard to summon up any feelings of patriotism. I wonder if he regretted the offence he caused, or whether it was intentional. At first he seems to question whether he did cause offence. I assure him that he did. </p> <p>\"If they were offended it was for the wrong reasons,\" he says curtly. \"They thought it was an attack on them when in fact it was a social comment. And that raises questions of whether they wanted to integrate or remain separate.\" </p> <p>In other words, if we were upset, it was our problem. But what about the mood music of the Conservative years; the sea of union flags at conferences, the reluctance to allow British Asians to bring their families to this country, the stop-and-search laws; could he not accept that it helped create distrust and cooled any potential loyalty among young Asians? He plays a straight bat, insisting it was \"the mood music that perhaps was being heard but it was not necessarily what was being played\". </p> <p>One of the reasons Tebbit was given such a hard time for his comments was that many of us were sceptical of his motives. There was a deep-rooted suspicion that the Conservatives considered immigration an affliction rather than a boon for Britain. Does he think Britain is a better country today because of its immigrants? \"I sometimes look at London and think, is this my city any more?\" he replies, a touch sadly. \"Because it is such a mix of races of peoples and cultures, and I have to say I was more comfortable with it as it was before. But it is there and it is happening and there are lots of things to be gained from it.\" </p> <p>He appears less than convinced about the benefits of integration. \"I sometimes think of our northern towns where there are large Asian communities who are looking out into society and they are being urged to integrate. It does not look like an attractive society and the people they are being urged to integrate with are not people I would particularly like to integrate with.\" </p> <p>He doesn't seem to be aware of the irony that his apprehension at the benefits of integration are shared by some militant Muslims who are equally repulsed by what they see as the moral failings of modern society. During his time in power, the dangers of integration were a social issue; these days they are a matter of national and international security. Tebbit was arguably ahead of his time since the questions he was raising have taken on far greater urgency and relevance in the wake of September 11. Maybe that is why the cricket test continues to have resonance; these days the notion of a shared Britishness is something that this government has encoded into law with tests of citizenship. </p> <p>Tebbit feels there is some better thinking these days, but amazingly goes on to say that he has sometimes been moved to warn David Blunkett that his policies are too illiberal. Since the Conservatives lost power, a new generation of Asians have grown up in this country with even weaker ties to the old countries. As their knowledge of their culture has diluted, Tebbit fears they are adopting some of the worst values of the British. Meanwhile, an Indian-born cricketer (Nasser Hussain) has led the England team and it has become acceptable to fly the flag of St George, once loaded with far-right symbolism. \"I think we've seized it back from the nasties of this world,\" Tebbit tells me. But I thought you were one of the nasties of the world? He smiles broadly. \"You can't expect me to agree with that, can you?\" </p> <p>Our time is almost at an end. Tebbit has to go to the Lords to catch up with Iain Duncan Smith. As the photographer shoots away, I wonder whose views have changed more over the past 15 years - Tebbit's, or mine? During the course of our conversation I had found myself agreeing with him more than I disagreed; agreed that integration should be welcomed, agreed that having allegiance to something called Britishness needs to be encouraged, even agreed that today's teenage British Asians ought to cheer for England. But as we shook hands and he stepped slowly towards his waiting car, I also found myself wondering how different things might be if, back when he had power, Tebbit had condemned us a little less and tried to understand a little more.</p>",
  "<p>The current pattern of pub ownership has pushed up the price of a pint in many locals to nearly 10p above the national average, according to a new pub guide. </p> <p>Two non-brewing, pub-owning companies, Enterprise and Punch, now control some 16,000 pubs - around a quarter of pubs in the UK. The price of a pint in these chains averages \u00a32.25, say the editors of The Good Pub Guide 2005. This is \"significantly more expensive\" than beer prices in free houses, where the average national price is \u00a32.16. </p> <p>\"It is difficult to escape the conclusion that this pattern of pub ownership, by loading nearly 10p extra on the cost of a pint, is working against the interests of consumers,\" said the guide's editors, Alisdair Aird and Fiona Stapley.</p> <p>They said it was imperative that the effects of price competition were now brought back into play.</p> <p>They added: \"Tenants of pub-owing companies (pubcos) owning more than a certain number of pubs - say 3,000 - should be given the legal right to buy and stock one beer from an independent supplier other than their own pubco.\" </p> <p>A spokesperson for the British Beer and Pub Association, which represents Enterprise and Punch, defended the pubcos.</p> <p> \"The analysis is just plain wrong. In 1989 - before the pubcos - a pint cost 2.8% of the average weekly wage, in 2004 the price of a pint is still 2.8% of the average weekly wage. </p> <p>\"In 1989 - before pubcos - the top five pub owning companies sold beer from five brewers. In 2004 the top five pub owning companies sell beers from more than 150 different brewers.</p> <p>\"The real story is great value beer, far greater choice and a brewing sector that is growing, flourishing because its clearly successfully selling its beer.\"</p> <p>Writing in the introduction to the guide, the editors said that they now believed that prohibiting smoking in pubs \"is so overwhelmingly in the interests of both customers and staff, that we would like to see a ban in place as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>They added that there was \"simply too much resistance within the industry\" for a voluntary approach to a ban to be successful. </p> <p>The editors noted that the number of pubs playing background music had stopped growing and may even have dropped slightly and that some pubs had scrapped their \"children welcome\" policy because of badly-behaved youngsters. </p> <p>They also reckoned that country pubs were more free of the yob element, which had switched its attention to \"big town boozers\". </p> <p>The guide named Lough Pool in Herefordshire as its pub of the year. </p> <p>The cheapest pints are currently served in Lancashire which has regained its best-value crown from Nottingham.</p>",

But three or more years is a long time to wait for the tools people need today. </p> <p>Luckily, some new desktop search tools are appearing, and could change the way we work with PCs. </p> <p>Outlook users have long complained about its slow and complex search tools, which rarely found the item as soon as you wanted it. The arrival this summer of the free Lookout plug-in changed that. Based on open-source tools from the Apache Foundation, Lookout was Outlook search on steroids. By keeping a local index of all your mailbox data, Lookout could pull up relevant responses in seconds. Its search engine could have been more refined, but that did not matter: Lookout's brute force approach came up with the goods. It also went beyond Outlook mailboxes, and indexed files held in Windows' My Documents folder. </p> <p>Lookout was so good that Microsoft's MSN division bought the company and, it is believed, will be working on a new search bar for Internet Explorer. Lookout has now become an official Microsoft download, ready to help you keep control of Outlook information overload. </p> <p>But Lookout is not the only tool that can search for the files you need. Copernic, a British company, is well known for its meta-search tool, which sits on your desktop and integrates search results from many of the most popular (and most reliable) search engines. Copernic Search has recently been joined by Copernic Desktop Search. Unlike Lookout, Copernic's offering is a standalone application, and it indexes files, music, pictures and videos along with email and contact information. </p> <p>Copernic's image search tools do not support the metadata information used by most digital cameras. Instead, you are limited to a date search - so you are probably better off using a tool such as Picasa, Google's recent purchase. Like iPhoto on the Apple Macintosh, Picasa is a tool for cataloguing images, though it also has rudimentary editing features. Unlike most image applications, Picasa continuously monitors your PC, automatically adding new photographs to its catalogue. </p> <p>Picasa is Google's first venture on to the desktop (unless you count the Google Toolbar), but it is unlikely to be the last. A Google desktop search tool, codenamed Puffin, is under development, but has been kept under wraps. Leaks have pointed to work being done using the Gecko rendering engine from the Mozilla open source browser project. Since the GBrowser domain name has been registered by Google, there is some speculation that this may be Puffin's final incarnation. </p> <p>Google is not the only company working along these lines. In March, Terra Lycos's HotBot search engine launched a toolbar that offers local-content search features, and in June, Ask Jeeves bought Tukaroo Inc, a San Jose-based desktop search technology company. However, Google is one of the few companies with the power to get its system widely adopted. </p> <p>The key to successful desktop search is the idea of context. Users do not need to be bombarded by information; instead they only want what is relevant to the task in hand. This is where Lookout succeeds, as it focuses mainly on email. However, you may want to see information related to the Word document you are editing, or the browser window you have opened. </p> <p>Drive into San Francisco on Highway 101 and you'll see billboards advertising Blinkx, a tool that mixes contextual information with desktop and web search, and uses technology from another British company, Autonomy. When Blinkx is running, you see a new toolbar in your application's title bar. This contains a set of icons that show whether Blinkx has found any documents on your PC, or on the web, related to the content of your window. Just roll the mouse over the icon to see a sample of the information Blinkx has found. It is an interesting idea, and when linked to the visualiser tools in Blinkx's web search engine, helps make more sense of how information is related to your query. </p> <p>One key to solving the desktop search problem is the use of metadata in our applications. When combined with standard XML document formats, this will give PCs their own little semantic web. This will put search at the heart of our operating systems - and the sooner, the better. </p> <p>Apple is including Spotlight desktop search tools in Tiger, the next release of its Mac OS X operating system. Apple says Spotlight is going to \"search all your stuff\", and deliver the information you need quickly, using lessons learnt from iTunes, Sherlock, and iPhoto. Like WinFS, Spotlight will use file metadata to index files quickly, with a deeper content index for more complex searches. As it is an operating system feature, developers will be able to build Spotlight searches into their applications - which Windows programmers won't be able to do until WinFS appears. </p> <p>The Linux desktop is also well on its way to a context-based search environment with Nat Friedman's Dashboard (which predates Apple's use of Dashboard for an unrelated application). This Dashboard is intended to index files, and then display relevant content based on what you are doing. The complexity is in building interfaces to application back-ends, and in building the tools for defining exactly what is relevant. There is no point in deluging users with information - it has the same effect as not giving enough information, or delivering irrelevant information. Users need to trust their search tools to deliver the results they need: no more and no less. </p> <p>The main limitations on desktop search tools are the use of disk space and processor cycles, which has discouraged the widespread use of Microsoft's indexing software. Search tools need to build indexes of the content on your system, and this can be anything up to 30% of the size of the original collection of files. But with a terabyte of hard drive space in desktop systems not far away, that is not as much of a problem as it may seem at first. </p> <p>Also, the arrival of multithreaded and dual-core processors will allow search tools to index things in the background in real time, rather than using cycles when we are away from our desks or, worse, slowing down the whole PC. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send comment to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@theguardian.com\"> online.feedback@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>A battle between the Government and the European Commission over cheap alcohol and cigarettes comes to a head in Brussels today. </p> <p>British customs officials are squaring up to Eurocrats at talks just two days before the Commission is due to activate threatened court action. </p> <p>Customs authorities are accused of targeting cross-channel shoppers taking advantage of the EU single market to import large consignments of cut-price booze and cigarettes from France.</p> <p>Heavy fines, impounded consignments of goods and even the confiscation of cars have triggered angry consumer complaints to Brussels. </p> <p>Under the EU's single market rules, shoppers can buy any amount of drink and cigarettes abroad, excise duty paid, and bring it into Britain without paying British excise duty - as long as it is for their themselves and not for commercial sale. </p> <p>According to EU guidelines, anything up to 800 cigarettes, 400 cigarillos, 90 litres of wine (including a mximum of 60 litres of sparkling wine) and 110 litres of beer should be considered to be for personal use, and therefore not subject to domestic excise duties. </p> <p>Above these \"indicative\" levels, shoppers can expect to be asked to pay excise duty, and possibly fined with the loss of the goods, if stopped by Customs staff. </p> <p>And British duty is supposed to be paid on all amounts of alcohol and cigarettes goods being brought in for someone else - friends or family - even if it is on a not-for-profit basis. </p> <p>Customs authorities will tell the Commission today that legitimate shoppers bringing back goods for their own use are not in the firing line. </p> <p> The target is smugglers abusing the system to bring in cheap goods for sale - cheating the Treasury of up to \u00a33 billion a year in lost excise duty. </p> <p>But the Commission says, while taking property may be justified in some cases, it amounts to a \"severe and intrusive\" sanction when applied to \"minor fiscal offences of a not-for-profit character\". </p> <p>The \"disproportionate\" penalties must end if court action is to be avoided, say officials. </p> <p>\"We are asking the UK authorities to change their practices for dealing with people bringing in large quantities of alcohol and tobacco to sell on a non-profit basis to their friends and families,\" said Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd. </p> <p> \"The current penalties - not only the level of fines and payment of fines but also the seizure of the goods and their cars - are disproportionate. We say they have to change.\" </p> <p>He added: \"We sincerely hope the UK authorities will be complying with our request. If they don't come up with the explanations we are looking for, unfortunately we will have little choice but to go to court.\" </p> <p>Treasury minister John Healey made clear that the Government would be keeping up its efforts to catch smugglers - because the excise duty losses to the Treasury are effectively borne by ordinary taxpayers. </p> <p>\"Smuggled cigarettes and alcohol undermine legitimate businesses across Britain.\" he said. </p> <p>The question on the eve of the talks was whether any compromise could be reached in a row which has put Chancellor Gordon Brown at loggerheads with EU single market Commissioner Frits Bolkestein. </p> <p>Mr Bolkestein stands down as a Commissioner at the end of this month - but his department says the issue will remain for as long as it takes to change the way cross-channel shoppers are treated. </p> <p>Mr Bolkestein said: \"Cross-border shopping is a fundamental right under EU law and should not be regarded as a form of tax evasion - even if it does give rise to revenue losses for the UK exchequer.\"</p>",
  "The Guardian thinks I'm a Republican and a conservative. I shouldn't let on that this belief is based on somewhat shaky ground, because this column is a sweet gig, and - well - why rock the boat? <p>But in truth, I'm neither - or at least, whatever I am sheds some light on how useful (or not) such labels are. The reasons I don't fit in very well on either the left or right sides of US politics shed some light on that divide, too.</p> <p>I'm certainly not a Republican, although I will very probably - actually, almost certainly - vote for George Bush this time. But I have been a card-carrying member of only two parties, the Democrats and, when I grew disenchanted with them, the Libertarians. </p> <p>I broke with the Democrats because, under President Clinton, they seemed to have abandoned their traditional support for civil liberties: Clinton's 1996 <a href=\"http://archive.aclu.org/news/n100296a.html\">Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> was, in many ways, a more sweeping assertion of government power than Bush's Patriot Act, which was really just about plugging some holes in the Clinton legislation.</p> <p>As for conservative - well, I don't know what that word means any more. I certainly don't fit in with the religious right. I support gay marriage, drug legalisation and abortion rights. I am in favour of stem-cell research, and against prayer in school.</p> <p>Nevertheless, some people call me a conservative because I support President Bush's war on terror, which is really (although Bush is too diplomatic to say so) a war on fundamentalist Islamist terror. I also oppose gun control (you can read a rather lengthy discussion of my views on the right to arms under the American constitution <a href=\"http://www.guncite.com/journals/reycrit.html\">here,</a> and a much shorter treatment <a href=\"http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/May-June-2002/scene_reynolds_mayjun2002.html\">here</a>). </p> <p>Does that make me a conservative? To paraphrase Clinton, it depends on what the meaning of conservative is. As I posted on my <a href=\"http://instapundit.com/archives/018220.php\">weblog</a> recently: \"I'd be delighted to live in a country where happily married gay couples had closets full of assault weapons.\" </p> <p>Is that a conservative belief? Perhaps, if the notion is the traditional strain of American belief that government should mind its own business, and that what goes on in our bedrooms, or our closets, is none of its business.</p> <p>Meanwhile, religiosity - something often associated, especially by Europeans, with American conservatism - is also a staple of the US left. Just look at that icon of US liberalism, Hillary Clinton. The north-eastern style leftism associated with her is sometimes frankly, sometimes implicitly, religious. As Michael Kelly noted in a profile of her, reprinted in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=wwwviolentkicom&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1594200122/qid%3D1081476930/sr%3D1-1\">Things Worth Fighting For</a>:</p> <p>\"The politics of Hillary Rodham Clinton are indeed largely liberal (although, the post election evidence indicates, no more so than those of her husband), but they are of a liberalism derived from religiosity. They combine a generally 'progressive' social agenda with a strong dose of moralism ...</p> <p>\"They are, rather than primarily the politics of left or right, the politics of do-goodism, flowing directly from a powerful and continual stream that runs through American history, from Harriet Beecher Stowe to Jane Addams to Carry Nation to Dorothy Day, from the social gospel of the late 19th century to the temperance-minded Methodism of the early 20th century to the liberation theology of the 1960s and 1970s, to the pacifistic and multi-culturally correct religious left of today ... </p> <p>\"It is concerned not just with how government should behave, but with how people should. It is the message of the preacher, a role Hillary Rodham Clinton has filled many times delivering guest sermons from the pulpits of United Methodist churches.\"</p> <p>And, actually, the roots of this do-goodism are ultimately in New England Puritanism, which had many characteristics associated with today's left. Among them were a hostility to wealth - illustrated by sumptuary laws - a belief that the welfare of the community trumped the rights of individuals (Hillary combined both these aspects in her famous recent <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2004/06/28/politics2039EDT0165.DTL&amp;type=printable\">statement</a>: \"We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good\"). Puritans favoured dense settlement in towns over spread-out farmers - they were, in a sense, the first opponents of \"sprawl\".</p> <p>Even the most stereotypical aspect of the Puritans is not as out of place as you might think. Puritans were, of course, notoriously hostile to sex, but the modern left has threads of those sentiments, too - witness the anti-sex screeds of Catharine MacKinnon or Andrea Dworkin. In fact, Puritans, who were actually quite enthusiastic about marital sex, may actually have been less Puritanical in this regard than some modern feminists.</p> <p>Not all leftwingers in the US are as frankly religious as Hillary Clinton, and many don't even realise that the ideas that they champion have deep religious roots. But even for these people, being leftwing has itself become a sort of religion, with those who disagree viewed as sinister, almost demonic forces, rather than simply as individuals holding different views. </p> <p>The language of righteousness and sin, if not that of redemption and grace, remains a hallmark of the purportedly secular left, though I find it no more attractive than the language of the religious right.</p> <p>I don't fit into the religious right or the religious left. But, in America, you don't get to choose a major political party that does not have some sort of religious strain to it. </p> <p>And it strikes me that one reason why politics in the US have become so much more <a href=\"http://instapundit.com/archives/018250.php\">bitter</a> over the past couple of decades is that two rather different threads of religiosity have come to dominate the two major parties in distinct fashion, where each party had previously incorporated major components of both. This has turned political battles into quasi-religious ones.</p> <p>Not being a devotee of either strain of American politico-religious faith, I find this rather tiresome, and more than a bit disturbing - but I think it's likely to represent the state of things for the foreseeable future.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Glenn Reynolds, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, runs the <a href=\"http://www.instapundit.com\">instapundit.com</a> US political blog</p> <p>Comment on this article <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives/us_elections/2004/10/loose_definitions.html\">here</a>.</p>",
  "Two bombs planted in a car and a motorcycle exploded at a gathering of Sunni Muslims in central Pakistan before dawn today, killing at least 39 people. <p>About 100 people were also injured, some 50 of them seriously, in what appeared to be a sectarian attack. The bombings came less than a week after a suicide attack killed 31 people at a Shia Muslim mosque in the eastern city of Sialkot. </p> <p>Around 3,000 radical Sunnis were gathered in a residential area of the city of Multan to mark the anniversary of the death of Maulana Azam Tariq, the leader of the outlawed Sunni radical group Sipah-e-Sahaba, who was killed in an attack last year blamed on Shia militants. </p> <p>A car bomb exploded at around 4.40am local time (2240 BST) near the venue, in the Rashidabad neighbourhood of the city, as people were starting to disperse after the overnight meeting. Two minutes later a second bomb, attached to a motorcycle, went off. </p> <p>About 2,000 angry Sunnis later gathered outside a hospital where victims of the explosions had been taken, shouting \"Shia are infidels!\" and slogans against the government, witnesses said. </p> <p>The deputy city police chief, Arshad Hameed, said: \"It seems to be an act of sectarian terrorism, but we are still investigating.\" </p> <p>Pools of blood and victims' shoes lay at the scene near the charred remains of the car. </p> <p>Jamil Usmani, 26, who had been standing in a nearby parking lot with friends, said: \"The explosion numbed our ears. We saw people falling on each other. Everybody was crying, everybody was running.</p> <p>\"Many people were injured in the stampede. We started picking them up and asked passing cars for help.\" </p> <p>Talat Mahmood Tariq, police chief for the Multan region, said the car bomb had been set off by remote control and most of the injuries had been caused by flying metal from the vehicle. </p> <p>The attack did not appear to be the work of a suicide bomber because no body parts had been found inside the car, Multan's police chief, Sikander Hayyat, told the private Geo television network. </p> <p>Witnesses said Sunni protesters gathered outside the Nishtar hospital had attacked two ambulances, shattering the windscreens with sticks; others burned tyres, creating a pall of black smoke. </p> <p>Inside the hospital bloodied victims were crammed into an emergency ward, some lying two to a bed. The dozens of dead were placed side by side on the floor of another ward. </p> <p>Officials said about 1,000 police, including reservists, had been called from other districts to step up security in the city, which has suffered sectarian violence in the past. </p> <p>Sunni Muslims make up about 80% of the 150 million people in Pakistan; most of the rest are Shia. The vast majority of both sects live in harmony, but radical elements on both sides carry out attacks. </p> <p>\"We condemn this terrorist attack. This is tragic,\" the information minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, said in the capital, Islamabad. \"The government will continue its mission against terrorism.\" </p> <p>The leader of the illegal Sunni group Sipah-e-Sahaba blamed the bombings on radical Shia. \"This is the worst kind of terrorism, and everybody knows who is behind it,\" said Ahmad Ludhianvi.</p> <p>The attack came hours after the burial of an alleged senior al-Qaida operative and Sunni Muslim militant, Amjad Hussain Farooqi, at a village in the east of Punjab province. Farooqi was killed in a shootout with security forces on September 26 in southern Pakistan.</p> <p>Multan, also in Punjab, is one of the most ancient cities in Pakistan. Pakistan, an ally in the US-led \"war on terrorism\", has suffered a spate of terrorist attacks in recent years and has a history of sectarian violence.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Trojan takes BT customer for a ride on the internet</strong><br> </p> <p>Mary Kill of York got in touch after she opened her BT telephone bill and was horrified to find she was being charged for two premium rate calls, at a total cost of \u00a333, neither of which she had made. On closer examination she realised the calls had each come at a time when she was online, using her BT Openworld dial-up connection to the internet. </p> <p>Kill phoned BT and was told she was the victim of what are known in the trade as rogue, drop-in or Trojan diallers. These horrible computer infections hijack your computer's ability to connect to the internet using the usual low-cost number, and prompt it instead to use a premium-rate or international number. What is worse, you aren't aware your machine is doing anything different from usual - until, like Kill, you receive the telephone bill. </p> <p>When Kill spoke to BT the problem was explained to her, but she was told - wrongly as it turned out - that she could deduct the offending amount from their bill. In fact she couldn't, as she paid by direct debit: and when her husband phoned again a few weeks later he was told he had been misinformed, and that BT does not pick up the tab for customers' innocent use of premium-rate calls due to dubious downloads. </p> <p>Jon Carter in the BT press office confirms that, regrettably, this is the case. He says BT gives the tiny profit it makes from the unwanted premium rate calls - around 3p per \u00a31.50 the customer spends - to the charity ChildLine, and that it is doing everything it can to alert customers to the existence of rogue diallers and to ways of dealing with it. Alas, footing the bill for the dial-up disasters would, he says, be taking BT's sympathetic stance too far, although over the next few weeks a second warning email will be sent to 1.8 million BT customers deemed at risk of the problem - that is, those who use dial-up as opposed to broadband internet connections. </p> <p>So if you use dial-up, what can you do to avoid a nasty shock when the phone bill arrives? Options include putting a free bar on all premium-rate numbers or using a removable bar, for \u00a31.75 a month, which allows you to lift the block when you really do want to use a premium rate number. BT says it is doing its bit by putting an immediate block on any number it even suspects of being a rogue dialler - incurring the wrath of companies whose premium rate numbers receive an accidental ban - and it announced this week that 1,000 numbers have so far been blocked. All of which is cold comfort to the Kills and the other 46,000 or so customers who have been hit by the demon diallers, though it will hopefully reduce the impact of the terrible Trojans in the months ahead. </p> <p><strong> Cheque bounces after bank gives the all clear</strong><br> </p> <p>Now a salutary tale from Irene Rogan, an artist who lives in Tintern, Monmouthshire. Last month Rogan received an email from a man purporting to be an art collector from Spain, who asked first for images of her paintings and then - hurrah! - wrote again to say he'd like to buy five paintings and have them shipped over. Rogan received a cheque for \u00a36,000: and while clearly hoping her buyer was genuine, she very sensibly decided to leave nothing to chance and phoned her bank, the Co-op, asking how long the cheque would take to clear - a particularly important consideration since her buyer had contacted her again, since sending the cheque, to say that instead of having the pictures shipped over to Spain he would like to collect them himself, and so could she kindly return the \u00a32,583 sent to cover shipping costs? </p> <p>The bank assured her, says Ms Rogan, that the cheque would clear three days later, on a Monday: so dutifully that day she went to the post office and paid for a MoneyGram with a debit card, confident that the money would only clear out of her account if the funds from Spain were by now safely installed. The transaction went through, and Rogan went home satisfied all was well: but imagine her consternation the following day when her card was declined on another purchase and, on phoning the bank, she heard the terrible news that the Spanish cheque had bounced and that her debit was cleared the previous day only because she was \"a valued customer\". </p> <p>Rogan was initially told she would have to take out an overdraft to pay off her now considerable debts, but, happily, press officer Julie Darroch was able to discover that her case was in fact under review, since when the bank has decided that, as a victim of fraud, Rogan is due a full refund. But more importantly for the rest of us is Darroch's advice on how long it can take a cheque to bounce: as many as five days in some cases, apparently: and given that banks do sometimes honour debit requests from good customers even when funds are not actually available, it always pays to double-check that the money really has landed rather than assuming from a cleared debit that all is well. </p> <p><strong> Prompt service delights K\u00e4rcher customer</strong><br> </p> <p>Finally to a happy tale from Jean Austin of Crawley, who phoned the K\u00e4rcher service desk in Banbury to ask about buying a new trigger for her pressure washer which sprang a leak \"after at least a year of good service\". Imagine her delight when \"the phone was answered speedily - by a human being! - and we were assured that a new handle would be dispatched, at no charge. This was on Wednesday, and on Saturday morning the new handle was delivered by the postman\", making Austin and her husband Ron two very happy customers. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Anna Tims is on maternity leave.

  "<p>Universal Pictures has announced the cancellation of <strong>American Gangster</strong>, the film based on the true story of Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, who smuggled heroin into the US in the coffins of soldiers killed in Vietnam. The movie was to have begun shooting in New York next month with a budget of $80m - but after director Antoine Fuqua walked off the film citing creative differences with studio heads, the entire project has now been shelved. It was to have starred Denzel Washington as Lucas and Benicio Del Toro as the New York detective who eventually apprehended him.</p> <p><strong>Mel Gibson</strong> has been granted a three year restraining order against a homeless man who allegedly trespassed on the star's estate and demanded they pray together. 34-year-old Zack Sinclair is being charged with six counts of trespass and disorderly conduct and has received an extended restraining order barring him from coming within 100 yards of Gibson, his wife or their seven children, their home, the Gibson children's school and the chapel that the family use.</p> <p><strong>Johnny Depp</strong> is lined up to star in an adaptation of a novel for which a multi-million dollar rights deal has just been signed. The rights to Gregory David Roberts' novel Shantaram have been sold to Warner Brothers for a reported $2m, a week before the book is even published in the US. Depp will play the novel's narrator, a young Australian heroin addict who escapes from prison and goes on the run to the slums of India before journeying to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight the occupying Soviet army. After completing work on Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Depp will also co-produce the project.</p>",
  "<p>The days of assorted family members, friends and business associates being given meaningless credits as a \"producer\" on a movie may soon be over. The Producers Guild of America has begun asking studios and production companies to abide by new guidelines issued by the body in which the nature of the role (and the ensuing credit) is more clearly defined than ever.</p> <p>For years, the guild says, a credit as producer has been handed out to actors, agents, managers and others with barely any link to the film industry at all as a gift or business sweetener - devaluing the job and confusing audiences as to what it actually means.</p> <p>Now, however, the PGA has launched a campaign called \"Truth in Credits\" after four years spent drawing up a workable definition of what a credit as producer should entail. The guild intends to use California law to oblige studios to follow its guidelines. \"Under California law, the false attribution of credit on a motion picture is false advertising, and statutory law prevents false advertising,\" said a lawyer for the PGA. </p> <p>\"After a generation of erosion of producing credits, the role of producer is becoming so muddled and confused that we must take action to preserve the very meaning of the term,\" the PGA's vice president Marshall Herskovitz said at the press conference called to announce the start of the campaign.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Calisto Tanzi</strong> Founder of Parmalat. Mr Tanzi, 65, transformed a family business - Calisto Tanzi &amp; Sons - selling prosciutto in the northern Italian town of Parma into one of Italy's biggest companies.

Mr Tanzi also seized the marketing opportunities provided by sporting activities such as football, skiing and motor racing to make Parmalat a top brand in Italy. <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/italy/story/0,12576,1114366,00.html\">The milk sheikh whose dream curdled</a> </p> <p><strong>Fausto Tonna</strong> Parmalat's former finance director. His first public utterance after his arrest was to wish journalists and their families a \"slow and painful death\". Described by one American banker who met him as having the \"manners of a peasant\" but a \"sharp mind for figures\", Mr Tonna served as finance director for 16 years until he resigned in February 2003. The 52-year-old, considered the financial brains behind Parmalat, worked his way up from a clerk's job after joining the company in the early 1970s. <strong>Stefano Tanzi</strong> The son of Calisto Tanzi and a former chief executive of Parmalat. He is also chairman of the Parma football team, which the Tanzi family took over in 1990. He has been questioned by Italian magistrates in Parma in connection with the investigation. </p> <p><strong>Gian Paolo Zini</strong> Outside counsel for Parmalat. Mr Zini, who divides his time between Milan and New York, is listed as a partner in the law firm Zini &amp; Associates. Italian and US prosecutors have been investigating whether Mr Zini helped Parmalat circumvent Italian antitrust laws. </p> <p><strong>Lorenza Penca</strong> Chairman of the Italian unit of the auditing firm Grant Thornton International, which was Parmalat's chief auditor from 1990 to 1999. Became the first defendant, along with another former Grant Thornton employee Maurizio Bianchi, to be sent for trial in the scandal, having elected to forgo the preliminary hearings which began on October 5. </p> <p>Deloitte &amp; Touche eventually replaced Grant Thornton because of an Italian law requiring companies to rotate auditors. But Grant Thornton remained auditor of Bonlat, Parmalat's secretive Cayman Islands subsidiary. </p> <p><strong>Luciano Del Soldato</strong> Served briefly as the company's chief financial officer in November 2003 after Alberto Ferraris resigned as finance chief. Mr Ferraris had replaced Mr Tonna as finance director in early 2003, but resigned on November 12 after questions surfaced about Parmalat's investment in Epicurum, a Cayman-based company.</p>",
  "A Thai policeman suspected of murdering two British backpackers last month has given himself up, local police said today. <p>Sergeant Somchai Visetsingha has been a fugitive since Adam Lloyd and his girlfriend, Vanessa Arscott, were shot dead in western Thailand in the early hours of September 9. </p> <p>Mr Visetsingha gave himself up near the border with Burma today and is to be flown to the provincial police headquarters, according to local police. </p> <p>Mr Lloyd, 25, and Ms Arscott, 23, were shot in the province of Kanchanaburi, close to the famous bridge over the river Kwai, after a row in a local restaurant. </p> <p>Mr Visetsingha was said to be the owner of the restaurant, believed to be called S&amp;S. He was understood to have had an argument with the couple, who were regular visitors to the premises. </p> <p>Reports at the time suggested the pair had been attacked as they left and headed back to their guesthouse. </p> <p>Mr Lloyd was shot in the stomach, head and arm before the killer turned on Ms Arscott, hitting her with his car and dragging her 200 metres down the road before shooting her in the body and head. </p> <p>Vej Somboon, a police colonel, said today Mr Visetsingha had turned himself in to a regional police commander in the Kanchanaburi province, about 70 miles west of Bangkok, and would be flown by helicopter to provincial headquarters. </p> <p>Police have conducted an intensive manhunt for Mr Visetsingha for nearly a month, with a reward of 100,000 baht (\u00a31,350) offered for help in capturing the suspect. </p> <p>British diplomats pressing for a resolution of the case are expected to meet Kanchanaburi police officials today to discuss the progress of the investigation. </p> <p>The area attracts many foreign tourists because it is the site of the bridge over the river Kwai, where Japanese troops built a railway using the forced labour of prisoners of war during the second world war. The bridge was made famous in David Lean's powerful 1957 film. </p> <p>Mr Lloyd was born in Northampton but grew up in Selsdon and Purley, in Surrey. He had recently moved to live with his parents in Torquay, in Devon. </p> <p>He went to school in Croydon before studying travel and tourism at East Surrey college, in Redhill. </p> <p>Ms Arscott's parents, Joyce and Graham, live in Ashburton, Devon. She had been studying health and fitness at college. The couple had planned the two-month trip to Thailand and Cambodia together, and they were murdered just days before they were due to fly home.</p>",
  "<p>The Conservatives yesterday moved to trump Labour's use of campaign pledge cards in the coming election when they published their own Time-table for Action - a 28-pledge guide to what Michael Howard's ministers would do in their first month of power. </p> <p>The timetable is a four-sided A3 document, based on the \"five early pledges\" in the shape of a business card championed by John Prescott in 1997 and 2001. </p> <p>The Tory card includes seven pledges which will be acted on \"within the first day of a Conservative government\" - among them a freeze on civil service recruitment and the reclassification of cannabis as a Class B drug - and two which Mr Howard says he will implement within an hour of entering No 10. </p> <p>In a symbolic emphasis of his desire to restore trust - the word that is haunting Tony Blair as \"sleaze\" did John Major - Mr Howard will immediately forbid political advisers in Whitehall from giving instructions to civil servants and make the Office of National Statistics independent of ministers. </p> <p>Since only one adviser, Mr Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, has the power to instruct officials, and the ONS insists it is independent, not much will change. But other instant reforms will have more serious consequences. </p> <p>There will be plans to give headteachers complete control over classroom expulsions \"to help restore discipline\"; Whitehall hospital targets will be abolished; a minister for homeland security will be appointed; and the police will have their paperwork cut. </p> <p>Mr Howard will also set a date, probably October 2005, for the EU referendum. The pledges have been tricked out this week as the Tory leader tries to balance rhetoric with the avoidance of hostages given to fortune. </p> <p>Within their first week ministers would also start ending Labour's early prisoner release scheme; stop \"best value\" contracts in town halls; end the \"no-switching\" rule which allows holiday visas to be extended; save threatened regiments and allow good schools to expand. </p> <p>Setting Britain \"on the path to lower taxes\" via a first Tory budget will take up to a month.</p>",
  "<p>The British music industry said today it would not balk from following its US counterpart in suing children as young as 12 for swapping tracks over the internet without paying for them.</p> <p>The British Phonographic Industry, which represents more than 90% of UK record labels, said 28 cases against the worst offenders were already pending and it promised hundreds more would follow.</p> <p>Asked if it would stop short of pursuing children - even if it resulted in a public relations disaster - the BPI said: \"It is not our intention to target children but [we will] if they are breaking the law on a very large scale.\"</p> <p>The use of illegal file-sharing networks has fallen in the US and sales have increased since the Recording Industry Association of America instigated more than 200 legal actions last March. However, the body prompted a PR backlash when it emerged that one of the cases involved a 12-year-old girl in New York, who paid $2,000 in an out of court settlement. </p> <p>The BPI's first spate of legal action will target those using file-sharing programmes such as Kazaa, iMesh, Grokster, Bearshare and WinMX. The body said it would target \"major uploaders\" - the 15% of users who make available three-quarters of the free tracks. </p> <p>It will identify users by their IP address, the code that distinguishes one internet connection from another.</p> <p>The BPI is stepping up its campaign against illegal file-sharing because its promotional campaigns and threats have failed to stop the activity.</p> <p>Peter Jamieson, the BPI chairman, today said lawsuits would become as common as action against shoplifters from record stores and market traders who sell pirate CDs. </p> <p>According to the BPI, about 6 million people are connected to peer-to-peer services, sharing 700 million illegal tracks.</p> <p>The services have proved hard to shut down because they do not store tracks in a physical location but allow individual users to share their CD collections with the world. </p> <p>\"We have been warning people for months that unauthorised file-sharing is illegal. These are not people casually downloading the odd track. They are uploading music on a massive scale, effectively stealing the livelihoods of thousands of artists and the people who invest in them,\" said Mr Jamieson. </p> <p><strong>BPI warns file-sharers: 'We are watching you'</strong><br></p> <p>Today's announcement follows a BPI warning in March threatening music pirates in the UK with legal action. Since then it has sent hundreds of thousands of instant internet messages to computer desktops, warning the most frequent users of file-swapping sites that they were being monitored. </p> <p>The BPI said the 28 file-sharers it was targeting were responsible for making up to 7,000 tracks available at any one time. </p> <p>It expects most cases to be settled before going to court - offenders will be forced to pay thousands of pounds in damages and will be subject to injunctions stopping them swapping tracks over the web. </p> <p>Jay Berman, the chairman of international trade body the International Federation of Phonographic Industries, said ignorance of the law was no defence. He pointed to research that revealed seven out of 10 people were now aware file sharing was illegal. </p> <p>\"A year ago, maybe, people could say they didn't know - but you'd be hard pressed to say the same today,\" he said. </p> <p>The industry's case has been strengthened by the emergence of dozens of legal internet download sites such as Apple's iTunes and Napster. There are at least 100 legitimate sites across Europe, offering more than 1 million tracks for about 79p each. </p> <p><strong>Piracy is theft, says minister Estelle Morris</strong><br></p> <p>Today's action by the BPI is part of a wider spate of legal proceedings co-ordinated by the IFPI around the world. </p> <p>The federation today said it was launching 459 actions, including some in the UK and France, taking the global total to more than 600. </p> <p>Music sales have been decimated across Europe in recent years. As a result of actions brought in March, up to 80 people have already paid fines of up to 13,000 euros. </p> <p>UK album sales have bucked the global trend but sales of singles have declined by half. The BPI said it feared the increasing popularity of broadband internet connections would hit album sales unless drastic action was taken.</p> <p>The government also backed today's initiative. The arts minister, Estelle Morris, said: \"Piracy is theft - pure and simple. Whether it's Jamelia or a jobbing musician, the artist suffers. We owe it to them to make sure they get a fair return for their creativity, flair and inspiration. </p> <p>\"The government supports the principle of proportionate legal action against the worst offending uploaders. I hope it will stop the habitual offender who uploads to make a quick buck out of other people's talent.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>Rupert Murdoch last night outlined concessions designed to allay fears that the tycoon would be given too much power over News Corp by shifting its domicile from Australia to the United States. </p> <p>The assurances were in response to opposition among Australian investors, who control about 20% of News Corp shares and were concerned their rights would be diminished in the move. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch said the company would not issue any \"super voting\" shares, giving him additional control; the company will retain its full foreign listing on the Australian stock exchange and any holder of 20% or more of the shares outstanding may call a special meeting of investors. </p> <p>He also said that the Murdoch family interests had agreed not to immediately acquire additional voting shares above the 29.47% they will own on re-incorporation. They will however be able to acquire another 3% every six months or 6% in aggregate every year. </p> <p>News Corp said it would also consider disclosure of the process used for succession planning when Mr Murdoch finally retires and the adoption of procedures to re-elect board members annually. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch needs backing from 75% of investors to get the plans through. He argues that moving the business to the US, where it now conducts most of its business, would make News Corp more attractive to American shareholders and improve access to capital. News Corp owns the Twentieth Century Fox film studio, the Fox television network and the New York Post, as well as the Sun and the Times in Britain.

It would cost $12bn and that would be too much.\" </p> <p>He also implicitly criticised BSkyB's former management, led by Tony Ball, for \"pushing for profit\" instead of adding subscribers.

  "David Tomkins must have considered it the silver lining on an otherwise very black cloud. He was serving five years in prison after pleading guilty to supplying heroin in Bristol, but when an attempt by the authorities to confiscate his assets collapsed on a technicality, he at least could console himself by looking forward to enjoying the proceeds of his crimes - from the string of flats in Bristol to the Toyota Land Cruiser, equipped with a \u00a34,000 in-car DVD system. <p>Then the case was passed to a new and little known law enforcement organisation called the Asset Recovery Agency. Using its far-reaching and controversial powers, the agency is taking legal action in the civil courts against Tomkins, who faces losing all \u00a3300,000 of his assets. </p> <p>He is just one of a growing number of people being targeted by the agency, which was set up in 2002 to make true the well-worn - and often inaccurate - adage that crime does not pay. </p> <p>Until now, the ARA and its activities have remained shrouded in secrecy. But in a two-month investigation the Guardian has spoken to investigators, lawyers and criminal figures, as well as obtaining access to court documents, to produce the first comprehensive account of the agency's operations and its impact on serious crime. </p> <p>The investigation has identified 22 people being targeted by the agency, most of them involved in allegations of drug trafficking. More than \u00a316m worth of assets believed to be derived from criminal activity have already been frozen. </p> <p>Most controversially, some of the targets have not been convicted of any crime and some remain unaware that they are being pursued. </p> <p>According to official estimates, there are at least 400 major underworld figures operating in this country, with assets of up to \u00a3440m. </p> <p>Crime is now a massive business. The National Audit Office estimates that illegal drug transactions alone could be worth up to 1% of GDP, or \u00a38.5bn a year. Fraud has been estimated at between \u00a35bn and \u00a316bn a year. </p> <p>Last week the ARA's position in the vanguard of the fight against crime was underlined by Tony Blair, whose speech to the Labour party conference included a promise that those \"believed to be part of organised crime will have their assets confiscated, their bank accounts opened up\". </p> <p>Before the ARA was launched, criminal assets were being confiscated in only 1% of cases. Now there are signs that underworld figures are discussing the new threat to their activities. \"Everyone knows about it,\" said one south London criminal. \"Everyone knows they can come and knock on your door and take your property away, but nobody knows anybody who's been done yet.\" </p> <p>Seven of the current targets have been convicted but have seen confiscation orders against them fail. </p> <p>They include David Bullen, a professional criminal from north London with a criminal record stretching back over 20 years, including a conviction for VAT fraud in 1984 and a 10-year sentence for his part in what was then one of Britain's biggest cocaine smuggling conspiracies in 1991. </p> <p>He was caught on video by Customs and Excise, boasting of his illegal turnover of \u00a31m a week. But after his conviction, he successfully appealed against a confiscation order for \u00a3375,000 of his assets. The agency has now frozen \u00a3230,000 of Bullen's property, including cash held in a British bank account, shares and a Mercedes. </p> <p>While its main remit is to target the \"Mr Bigs\" of gangland - in line with the prime minister's promise - it is also focusing much of its attention on relatively small-time characters such as Tomkins. </p> <p>Jane Earl, the agency's director, said: \"Our cases range from major league criminals who have acquired a lot of property from trading on the misery of others, to relatively small-time criminals who act as adverse role models for impressionable youths, where we are sending out the very strong message to local communities that crime does not pay.\" </p> <p>But while the ARA's operations against convicted criminals are relatively uncontentious, it faces strong criticism for its attempts to seize the assets of people who have no criminal convictions. </p> <p>Four cases being handled by the ARA involve people who were acquitted, or whose prosecutions were either stopped by the trial judge or dropped for other reasons. They include a Truro businessman, Robert Stevens, who disappeared from the country before he was due to face trial for fraud in 1999. </p> <p>The charges against him have since been dropped, but his bank account containing \u00a320,000 remains frozen by the ARA. </p> <p>Tony Barnfather, one of the first solicitors to deal with a civil recovery case brought by the agency, said its powers effectively allowed it to circumvent the rule of double jeopardy and punish people in the civil courts after criminal prosecutions have failed. \"In effect, having failed to prosecute cases successfully the first time, the state is having a second bite at the cherry,\" he said. </p> <p>But the agency rejects this criticism. \"Respondents have every opportunity to explain to the court how assets were acquired lawfully,\" Ms Earl said. \"A challenge under the human rights convention that proceedings were criminal in character, not civil, was comprehensively rejected by the high court in Belfast in April.\" </p> <p>One case uncovered by the Guardian involves a leading member of the UK Chinese community who has never been convicted or even charged with a criminal offence but who has had \u00a3900,000 of his assets frozen by the ARA. </p> <p>He JiaJin, vice-president of the London China Town Chinese Association, was questioned by the National Crime Squad in 2001 as part of an investigation into organised people trafficking. </p> <p>In conjunction with arrests in Hong Kong and Australia, officers obtained search warrants for Mr He's premises and arrested him for questioning over allegations of money laundering. </p> <p>He was held overnight but the Crown Prosecution Service advised that there was not enough evidence and he was never charged or prosecuted. The first Mr He knew of the action against him was when ARA officials arrived at his home in Orpington and he was woken up by banging on the door. </p> <p>According to an interim report to the court, the investigation has focused on Mr He's money transaction business, Futsing Finance, \"through which it is alleged that the respondents facilitated payments in respect of human trafficking\". </p> <p>But Mr He told the Guardian: \"It is not payments from criminals, or payments to criminals, or to traffickers. These are transmissions of money [from Chinese immigrants] to their families.\" </p> <p>He compared the ARA's actions to that of Chinese communists: \"It reminds me of the cultural revolution in China when officials thought you were a danger to the party.\" </p> <p>Mr He and his companies support the UK Fujian Community Centre and sponsored Soho's Chinese new year celebrations, alongside the Metropolitan police and the army. </p> <p>\"The only thing that has gone wrong is I've been involved in helping a lot of Chinese when they are in trouble,\" Mr He said. </p> <p>\"I am quite well-known in the Chinese community and have dealt with so many Chinese, Fujianese problems. I help deal with a lot of illegal immigrants for the authorities.\" </p> <p>It is cases like that of Mr He that have provoked allegations that the agency's powers are draconian, eroding the distinction between criminal and civil law. </p> <p>\"It undermines the presumption of innocence and amounts to a way in which the state can target people even though it is unable to prove that they are guilty of any criminal offence,\" said Gareth Crossman of the human rights group Liberty. \"In effect it gives the authorities a second chance to target individuals they believe to be involved in crime.\"</p>",
  "Sudan bowed to a five-point plan tabled by Tony Blair during talks in Khartoum yesterday, which included accepting the free movement of 3,500 African Union troops as ceasefire monitors in Darfur province. <p>Mr Blair also urged Sudan to return its troops to barracks and accept a deadline of December 31 for an agreement on devolution for the south of the country. He hopes this will serve as a model for peace in Darfur.</p> <p>Mr Blair held two hours of talks with Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, during which he warned that the EU and US were willing to go to the UN to impose sanctions.</p> <p>Privately, the prime minister believes the west will know by the end of the year whe- ther Sudan is serious about honouring its commitments.</p> <p>Attacks by militia linked to the Sudanese government have led to the displacement of 1.4 million people from Darfur and as many as 50,000 deaths. Khartoum says it has no control over the militias but Mr Blair's plan implicitly questions this.</p> <p>He said yesterday: \"All of us have watched with concern and alarm at the death, disease and destruction that has come to Darfur. It is imperative that the people of Darfur realise the international community is determined to assist them in any way that it can.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair won Mr Bashir's agreement to the expansion of the African Union's force in Darfur to monitor the ceasefire negotiated in April between rebels and the government.</p> <p>The force will, in Mr Blair's words, ensure \"that we get the correct information on what is happening, including ensuring the Sudanese government's full cooperation\".</p> <p>Sudan has also agreed to identify the location of its troops and those of any militia under its control.</p> <p>Mr Bashir also accepted that Sudanese troops would return to their barracks. This would allow them to be replaced by police as refugees returned to their homes.</p> <p>Mr Blair urged the Sudanese government to resolve the separate long-running dispute in the south by the end of the year.</p> <p>He said such an agreement would have a knock-on effect on the dispute in Darfur and set the terms for a settlement in the western province.</p> <p>\"It will meet justifiable demands for greater devolution whilst making it clear the territorial integrity the country is preserved,\" he said.</p> <p>The Sudanese also agreed, as before, that humanitarian aid would be allowed to move through Darfur freely.</p> <p>Mr Blair ruled out the deployment of British troops but said that Britain was willing to provide logistical support to help expand the African Union's military contingent.</p> <p>He said: \"We don't need these forces in several months time, we need them now. We will help them get there as quickly as possible.\" </p> <p>He characterised Khartoum's commitments as \"the beginnings\". </p> <p>\"They have to follow it through in practice. We cannot have a situation in which thousands of people are dying,\" he said. </p> <p>Sudan's foreign minister, Mustafa Osman Ismail, said his government had been put under no pressure from Mr Blair. </p> <p>\"Rather he expressed his concern and Britain's concern and the concern of the international community about the situation in Darfur,\" Mr Ismail said. </p> <p>\"And we share this same concern. The conditions in Darfur are not normal.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair urged the rebels in Darfur to stick to their commitments. Khartoum has pointed to statements from UN officials claiming that the rebels have attacked Sudanese positions. </p> <p>Mr Blair has been struck by the vehemence of the American administration's anger at the Sudanese government, partly based on the belief that it is black Africans who are being attacked by an Arab-led government. </p> <p>His hopes for a comprehensive agreement by the end of the year may prove optimistic, because the insurrection in the south has lasted more than 20 years and the Sudanese have ruled out offering self-rule in Darfur. </p> <p>Sanctions, still an option for the UN, would cripple the Sudanese government, which depends on oil production to keep the economy afloat.</p>",
  "<p>Fifteen years ago, the world's television screens relayed images of Daniel arap Moi, Kenya's then president, and myself setting fire to 2,000 elephant tusks. Kenya could have earned millions of pounds by selling the stockpile. But I believed we had to illustrate graphically the impact of the ivory trade, and show that the only way of saving Africa's elephants was to destroy the trade. </p> <p>Throughout the 1980s, ivory trading - most of it fed by rampant poaching - had slashed the continent's elephant population from 1.3 million to just 625,000. Kenya, especially, was hit hard: 80% of its elephants were massacred. A few months after the burning, the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) put a ban on the trade, and the bloodshed slowed to a trickle. </p> <p>This week, delegates from 166 countries have gathered in Bangkok for another meeting of the convention, set up to ensure that trade in wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. However, it is clear that parties to Cites - not least the UK government - are trying to alter its aims. Swayed by the doctrine of sustainable development and the market economy, they have developed a cavalier attitude towards the very species the convention was created to protect. What's more, they are promoting trade where there is need for caution. </p> <p>The meeting will consider making Cites subordinate to less conservation-minded bodies such as the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the Convention on Biological Diversity, while measures to increase protection for commercially valuable species are likely to face stiffer opposition than ever. Previously unimaginable trade proposals such as trophy hunting requests for black rhinos, whose numbers fell by 96% between 1970 and 1992, are also up for discussion. </p> <p>The fashionable mantra of \"use it or lose it\" holds that conservation is only possible if a price is put on the heads of endangered species, and that people in developing countries will only hold back from wiping out species if they can see a financial benefit in preserving them. Yet, historically, trade has been the foremost factor in the decimation of scores of species, from tigers to cod. The illegal trade in wildlife is estimated to rank only behind the illegal trades in drugs and arms. Opening up even a limited legal trade creates a smokescreen, allowing the illegal market to thrive and making effective policing next to impossible. </p> <p>Sustainable use may sound reasonable, but in reality it dodges definition. There is a gulf between ecological and economical sustainability. All elephants could be slaughtered tomorrow and yet an economically sustainable ivory trade maintained for years to come, as invested profits could provide an income in perpetuity. </p> <p>It is unsurprising that the reprieve for elephants has not lasted. Swayed by a few pro-trade southern African countries, whose fenced-in elephant populations were relatively unaffected by poaching, Cites agreed to allow sales of stockpiled ivory. Subsequently, we have witnessed a resurgence in poaching and ivory seizures to a level not seen since before the ban. And yet the push to reopen the trade continues: Namibia is asking Cites for an annual ivory export quota, as well as permission to trade in worked ivory, elephant hair and - with South Africa - leather. </p> <p>These countries say they have the right to profit from their natural resources. This sounds reasonable until one considers that many poorer countries are campaigning against this. Kenya, supported by many other African states, is proposing a 20-year moratorium on ivory trade. </p> <p>The economics of the ivory trade do not add up. Most countries where elephants live are poor and politically chaotic, and the effect of allowing even a limited trade would outweigh any benefits. Already struggling to protect their wildlife, these countries will be the first port of call for poachers, leading to increased costs in terms of both law enforcement and rangers' lives. </p> <p>And where is the evidence that ivory sales benefit conservation? There has been no audit of how income from the 1999 stockpile sale was spent. Botswana, one of the countries that sold its ivory, admitted that 30% of the income allocated to community development remains unspent. With human populations growing, it is undeniable that many countries are experiencing serious habitat destruction and human-wildlife conflict. I am the first to support efforts to compensate farming communities for destruction of crops or loss of life caused by animals. However, given that Kenya still has only 20% of the elephants it had in 1970, this is an issue to be resolved by developing long-term land-use policies rather than exterminating wildlife. </p> <p> Funding conservation is often a question of political priorities, too. Swaziland wants to raise funds for rhino conservation by trading in white rhinos, while the king is reportedly building palaces for each of his 13 wives. Animals are often worth significantly more over a lifetime in terms of tourist dollars than the sale of their body parts, so trading wildlife in the name of either conservation or development is a flawed strategy. Centuries of trade in products such as ivory have never alleviated poverty in Africa, and never will. It is the end-dealers in consuming countries who reap the profits. The developing world has suffered for too long from such plunder. </p> <p>The end-market for many endangered species products is Europe, which has hunted so much of its own wildlife to extinction. The EU's single block vote is crucial in many Cites decisions, and with expansion this year, it is vital that it votes in favour of conservation, not trade. </p> <p>I hope the UK government will not stand for further mauling of the convention, but will instead seek solutions to the planet's wildlife woes that are truly sustainable - in the ecological sense - for both people and animals. </p> <p>\u00b7 Richard Leakey was director of the Kenya Wildlife Service until 1999.

  "Two Israelis and an American have won the 2004 Nobel prize for chemistry for helping to understand how the human body gives the \"kiss of death\" to rogue proteins to defend itself from diseases such as cancer. <p>The work of Aaron Ciechanover and Avram Hershko, and the American Irwin Rose, in the 1980s could help treat illnesses such as leukaemia and cystic fibrosis by identifying how the body \"degrades\" unwanted proteins. </p> <p>\"When the degradation does not work correctly, we fall ill. Cervical cancer and cystic fibrosis are two examples,\" the Academy citation, said, adding that such knowledge \"offers an opportunity to develop drugs against these diseases and others\". </p> <p>\"We are not a building that stays still, we are all the time exchanging our proteins, synthesising and destroying them,\" Mr Ciechanover said yesterday. </p> <p>\"Some proteins get spoilt.

  "The September 11 attacks on the US were such an unprecedented form of terrorism that the government was justified in taking strong action to protect its citizens, the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, told nine law lords yesterday. <p>The attorney general defended the government's decision to opt out of Britain's obligations under the European convention on human rights to allow foreign nationals to be detained indefinitely on suspicion of involvement in terrorism. </p> <p>He was responding to an appeal by nine foreign suspects who have been detained for nearly three years in high-security conditions without charge or trial under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. </p> <p>Britain suspended its obligations under article five of the human rights convention - the right to liberty - to pass the act, something which is allowed only in cases of \"public emergency threatening the life of the nation\". </p> <p>The nine men are asking the law lords to declare that Britain's suspension of article five is unlawful and the part of the act under which they are detained is incompatible with the human rights convention. </p> <p>The detainees are free to leave Britain if they wish, but under an absolute obligation in the human rights convention they cannot be returned to their own countries if they face death or torture there. </p> <p>According to Lord Goldsmith's written submissions to the law lords, Britain continues to pursue other options for the detainees. These including trying to persuade third countries to take them, and seeking diplomatic assurances that they will not be subjected to torture if returned to their home countries. </p> <p>But the international organisation Human Rights Watch said yesterday there was evidence that two Egyptian nationals sent home by Sweden after similar assurances had been tortured. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said the events of 2001 demonstrated the threat against western democracies. The UK was a designated target for Islamic extremists. </p> <p>He said the power to detain without trial, which meant the UK had to opt out of the relevant section of the European convention on human rights, had been enacted in response to the threat posed by a group of foreign nationals who had no immigration rights in Britain. </p> <p>The government would have been entitled to deport the men but for the time being cannot because of concern for their human rights - they faced death or torture in their own countries and were seeking asylum in the UK, said Lord Goldsmith. </p> <p>\"But to protect the human rights of the millions of British residents and those whose human rights the government has a duty to protect, we took the view that, if these people cannot be deported, they should not be allowed to roam free on the streets and so they had to be detained. </p> <p>\"This was not a step taken lightly. The government believes it was a legitimate and appropriate response to protect the human rights of the suspected international terrorists ...\" </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said both the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, which reviewed the detainees' cases, and the appeal court had concluded that the conditions for opting out had been met.</p> <p>He added this brand of terrorism involved attacks which came without warning after months of careful planning.</p> <p>\"These events required the government of this country to assess the threat to the UK and what measures it was necessary to take to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks ... \" </p> <p>He said these discussions had taken place at the highest political level. The four-day hearing is expected to end today with the law lords reserving judgment.</p>",
  "Positive discrimination by universities in favour of applicants from state schools could breach human rights legislation, a report commissioned by independent school heads said yesterday. <p>Research for the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference concludes that introducing any \"rigid system\" that takes a university candidate's school background into account would be less fair than treating applicants as individuals. </p> <p>The Higher Education Funding Council has said taking factors such as school type into account may be illegal under the Human Rights Act. </p> <p>The paper, written by Alan Smithers of Buckingham University's centre for education and employment research, argues that could mean that making lower offers to state school pupils breaks the law. </p> <p>Independent school heads are fighting a rearguard action against government moves to widen the range of students admitted to university as well as to expand overall numbers. </p> <p>They were outraged by new targets published last week suggesting leading research-led universities should be recruiting a far higher proportion of state school pupils. </p> <p>Independent schools are concerned that universities are already beginning to discriminate on school background. Bristol University provoked independent sector fury when it opted to take into account the performance of candidates' schools, and to make lower grade offers accordingly. </p> <p>Some research indicates state school students with worse A level grades than their private school counterparts achieve the same degree class at university, though the paper argues the \"school effect\" is small. </p> <p>A new university access regulator, Offa, will require universities wishing to charge new top-up tuition fees to prove they are making efforts to widen participation. However, a government working group on university admission recommended that, while universities should take school background into account, they should treat candidates as individuals. </p> <p>Cynthia Hall, the president of the Girls' School Association, which commissioned the new research jointly with HMC, said independent schools were \"interested\" in the possibility of a legal challenge. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The HMC drew back yesterday from boycotting school league tables. But heads acknowledged the tables encouraged some schools to force pupils to drop subjects in which they were likely to do badly.</p>",
  "The Tory leadership intensified its campaign to woo back disaffected Eurosceptic voters yesterday by promising to revive Margaret Thatcher's handbag style of diplomacy. <p>Reflecting the fear that leading frontbenchers could be unseated by the UK Independence party, the shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, declared that a Tory government would fundamentally reform Britain's relations with Europe. </p> <p>\"We will be as obstinate as the French, as dogged as the Spaniards and as hardnosed and committed in negotiation as Margaret Thatcher,\" he said. </p> <p>In an attempt to burnish the party's Eurosceptic credentials, he said a Tory government would end the \"conveyor belt\" that had taken powers from Britain to Brussels. </p> <p>\"On the day after we win the general election next May we will set the date for that referendum [on the EU constitution], and it will be before we meet again at our conference next October,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The no vote for which we will campaign will stop the constitution in its tracks. It will force European leaders back to the drawing board at a time when we will lead the European agenda.\" </p> <p>The leadership has been nervous about mentioning Ukip in public after an attack by Michael Howard in the summer was seen to have given it a publicity coup. But Mr Ancram made it clear it was time to tackle the party head on when he issued a direct appeal to its supporters. </p> <p>A vote for Ukip at next year's general election would encourage supporters of a federal Europe by indirectly boosting the Labour vote, he said. </p> <p>\"There is only one party determined fundamentally to reform Europe and determined to reclaim control of our own destiny that can possibly form a government,\" he said, \"and that is the Conservative party\". </p> <p>\"Not Labour or the Lib Dems. They want the opposite. Not Ukip. They know they will never be in power. We are the only party who can and will change Europe, who can and will bring powers back.\" </p> <p>He lambasted Tony Blair for failing to stand up to the French and Germans. \"There can be few more humiliating sights than a British prime minister ingratiating himself with his French and German counterparts. One day poodle Blair. Next day dachshund Blair. But bulldog - never.\" </p> <p>Centre-ground Tories who feel uneasy about tacking to the right on Europe are happy with this week's appeals because the leadership has stopped short of calling for Britain to withdraw from the EU. </p> <p>But the growing support in the party for withdrawal was highlighted by the MEP Daniel Hannan, a Daily Telegraph columnist, who suggested that Britain would be better off if it abandoned the EU. </p> <p>Mr Hannan, who has agitated for years for the Tories to move to the right on the touchstone issue, stopped short of saying it directly but made clear his belief that Britain should look to a future outside the union. </p> <p>He said: \"The reality is we are perfectly capable of prospering independently in an alliance and commercial relationship with our friends and allies on the continent. The four richest peoples in Europe live respectively in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. That ought to suggest there is an alternative.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rome: Total War<br> PC, \u00a339.99 The Creative Assembly/ Activision,<br> ***** </p> <p>With all the waiting for Doom 3 and Half-Life 2, the final game in the Total War trilogy crept up like the master tactician it is. Well, wake up, because if you're looking for the game of the year, you have two serious contenders here - for a turn-based and a real time strategy game. </p> <p>The strength of the Total War games was always the battles - panoramic beauties where soldiers fought like you imagine they once did: half stoic bravery, half blind panic. Even so, the new 3D engine is a revelation. The ease with which you can zoom in on soldiers is something others have tried but never pulled off this well. Consequently, the battles - featuring up to 5,000 men on each side - are as enthralling to play as to watch. </p> <p>The weakness was always the boring bits in between, and here's the big surprise, because these too have been overhauled. You now have a proper turn-based strategy game that is as fun to play as Rise of Nations, formerly the best in its genre. </p> <p>On the world map you can run your empire in six-month turns - developing towns, claiming resources, everything short of seizing control of the Senate, which forms the climax of the single-player game. Once you've completed that, there are 10 historical battles, two multiplayer modes and all the online support you want. </p> <p>As far as war games go, The Creative Assembly has raised the bar so high other developers must be reaching for the hemlock. <br> <strong> Mike Anderiesz</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Fable</strong><br> Xbox \u00a339.99 Bullfrog/Microsoft,<br> **** </p> <p> Peter Molyneux has been responsible for such fine games as Populous and Syndicate. So his latest offering, Fable, has been widely anticipated. This is a third-person action role-playing game (RPG) in the mould of the Zelda series. </p> <p>It starts rather slowly with a young boy, then takes off properly when he reaches adulthood. By choosing quests, players can decide what their hero becomes. But while other RPGs, most notably the fabulous Knights of the Old Republic, offered similar freedoms, the beauty here is in the reaction of the world's inhabitants. </p> <p>If you do the right thing - slay hoodlums, escort traders - then everyone will offer admiration, respect and love. Do the opposite and they'll cower in fear from your sword. </p> <p>As you show off your latest trophy to cheering villagers, it is easy to get a feeling for the lifelike world that Molyneux and his team were aiming for. But the meat of the game is exploration and combat. The latter is satisfying, but exploration is elementary, with obvious signposting and no room to deviate from pathways. </p> <p>The environments are expansive and convincing but the character graphics lack detail. Despite not reaching all the heights hoped for, Fable is innovative and hugely enjoyable. <br> <strong> Greg Howson </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Fifa Football 2005</strong><br> PS2, Xbox, GameCube, PC, \u00a339.99 Electronic Arts Sports<br> *** </p> <p> Fifa Football 2004 was EA Sports' nadir. Its chief innovation was an unusable \"after-touch\" gimmick, which it spent so long developing it was not finished properly in time for release. So fundamental features, such as the ability to alter the game's speed, were omitted. </p> <p>Happily, this year's effort is much better - although not good enough to reclaim top spot. The after-touch control has been ripped out and a more useful first-touch control, operated using the right analogue stick, installed. </p> <p>Excellent graphics, an improved, more realistic passing system, a free-kick system that operates in a logical manner and a Pro Evolution Soccer-like press-and-hold shooting system constitute the game's highlights. There is also support for online play across all platforms now that EA has begun to support Xbox Live. </p> <p>A career mode, in which you take the reins of a lowly club and work your way up to the Premiership, or favourite global league, is an intriguing addition, but controlling players who would be more at home on Hackney Marshes proves frustrating. </p> <p>However, there are still areas in which Pro Evolution Soccer remains superior - namely, off-the-ball player movement when going forward, and automatic player selection. This year's Pro Evolution Soccer will also be available for the Xbox. Fifa Football 2005 marks a return to form, but it is no undisputed world-beater. <br> Steve Boxer</p>",
  "<p> Portable PCs are getting as powerful as desktop systems, and Intel is promising even more powerful notebook systems with dual-core processors next year, or the year after. By then, at least a third of notebooks will have widescreen displays and we'll see portables with high-quality graphics and high-definition audio. But when will we get a notebook with a battery that lasts long enough to do a full day's work? </p> <p>Not until 2010, says Mike Trainer, chief mobile technologist at Intel: we need a whole new battery chemistry and that takes time. But three new battery technologies will be available next year, and they all promise better battery life in the long run. </p> <p>Fuel cells are likely to get the most attention initially, because they have been promising cheap, clean power for a long time. And they seem to be on the verge of delivering. Earlier this year, Nokia showed a Bluetooth headset powered by methanol. Millennium Cell has a prototype Hydrogen on Demand fuel cell that can power a standard notebook. Smart Fuel Cell's PowerBoy methanol fuel cell will run for around 12 hours from a single fuel cartridge (manufactured by Bic), but this is an external unit, into which you plug your laptop. The company promises a production model next year, with a smaller and sleeker (but still external) version in 2006. </p> <p>A hydrogen cell is much more efficient, though there are problems putting the pumps and coolers needed for an active cell inside something that can fit in a battery slot. When we do see internal fuel cells, they will probably be passive versions - without the pipes and pumps. </p> <p>Pionics is taking an approach that is less revolutionary but possibly more likely to deliver: improving the lithium polymer batteries used in mobile phones and gadgets such as the iPod, to deliver enough power for laptops. Lithium polymer is very convenient because you can make the battery any size and shape you want, but they have had less capacity than lithium ion batteries. </p> <p>By improving the chemistry used for the anode and cathode, Pionics gives the batteries higher charge capacity and packs more battery into the same space. They offer half as much charge again as existing batteries; by the time they go on sale in 2006, they are aiming for double. The disadvantage is that with twice the capacity, the batteries could take twice as long to charge. </p> <p>Zinc Matrix Power is also taking an existing technology and improving it. Zinc is cheap, non-toxic and produces plenty of power. Zinc alkaline batteries run everything from radios to toy cars, but you can't recharge them repeatedly. When the zinc reforms on the anode, it isn't a uniform layer ready to react with the alkaline again: it forms branching structures called dendrites (like tiny trees), and eventually they grow across to the cathode and short out the battery. </p> <p>ZMP encapsulates the zinc in a plastic polymer so that it can't build up and create a short. It has also improved the way the zinc reforms and recombines with the hydrogen produced while the battery is charging, so there isn't a problem with pressure. Put it all together and you get twice the charge capacity of a standard lithium battery and up to six times the battery life. As a result, eight cells fit neatly into the same space as an existing laptop battery and run for about twice as long. </p> <p>One disadvantage of zinc is that it will take all night to get a full charge, but recharging for an hour gives you six hours of battery power. </p> <p>It's not just for laptops either: ZMP expects to power PDAs, mobile phones and even military lasers. The only thing they can't replace is traditional zinc batteries in existing products, because the batteries have to be square rather than round. </p> <p>Both ZMP and Pionics will sell their batteries to manufacturers and battery suppliers, and they expect to be producing enough to take serious orders by the middle of 2006. </p> <p>As well as new battery technologies, there is a range of ways to get more working time from existing batteries. Switching to dual-core processors means finer control of the chip, with the ability to lower the voltage of areas that don't need to calculate as fast. That is the way Centrino chips save power, and with dual-core processors, there are more opportunities to slow things down. </p> <p>But with many products, the screen consumes most of the power, and three-quarters of that goes into the backlight. Notebook manufacturers can improve battery life and make the screen look better by tuning the display controls so that the inverters produce a clean sine wave: that gives you just as much brightness for far less power. The next stage is to get the screen to use less power in general: only 4% of the light produced actually makes it to the screen, so developing new materials that let more of the light through would be more efficient. </p> <p>Software developers and makers of peripherals can do their bit, too, by thinking about the increasing number of mobile users and powering hardware down whenever possible. Intel's Battery Life Optimisation Program is designed to share techniques, and there is a new version of the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification with more power management options. </p> <p>According to Intel, good battery life has not been a priority with notebook manufacturers because buyers used to complain about it after they had bought a machine, rather than saying it was important while they were still shopping. As usual, technology follows the money. </p> <p> <strong> Useful links </strong><br> <a href=\"http://millenniumcell.com\">http://millenniumcell.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pionics-inet.co.jp/e-index.html\">www.pionics-inet.co.jp/e-index.html</a> <a href=\"http://www.zmp.com\">www.zmp.com</a></p> <p><strong> Extended Battery Life Working Group</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.intel.com/labs/features/hw03032.htm\">www.intel.com/labs/features/hw03032.htm</a></p>",
