  "<b> Evening Standard</b> <br> Editorial, London, August 17 <p>\"The warning from the government's information commissioner, Richard Thomas, about the risk of 'sleepwalking into a surveillance society' [on Monday] is timely ... To make its case for [further] measures, the government must show how [it] would make a real difference to the public's safety. This is by no means as obvious as is often assumed. CCTV, for example ... appears to make little long-term impact on the late-night violence it is supposed to curb ... </p> <p>\"The other worry is that grandiose computer-based systems, such as the one needed for ID cards, simply won't work: the government's record on large IT projects is poor. If technology can be used to make us safer, there may be arguments in favour of [new] databases. But ministers have to make the case why we should risk our privacy and civil liberties with schemes which could yet have unintended consequences.\" </p> <p><b> Herald </b><br> Editorial, Scotland, August 17  </p> <p>\"[Mr Thomas's] reservations would have less validity if he, and the rest of us, were not staring into an information void of the government's own making concerning its intentions for ID cards and how they would be used in tandem with the Citizen's Information Project and the children's database ... </p> <p>\"The case for ID cards, such as it is, is a microcosm of ministerial complacency, uncertainty or ineptitude concerning information handling. The home secretary, David Blunkett ... says they are a good idea, but cannot explain why. Are they to combat terrorism? Tighten immigration controls? Provide (or limit) access to benefits and services? ... The government's casual approach towards ID cards ... must be resisted.\" </p> <p><b> Sun </b><br> Editorial, August 17  </p> <p>\"The age of the real Big Brother (not the TV series) is arriving later than George Orwell envisaged ... But it is not all bad news. The tax-dodgers will be exposed, the money launderers nailed. Uninsured drivers tracked down. And illegal immigrants exposed. </p> <p>\"The advance of information technology cannot be turned back. But we're still an open democracy. And it is up to all of us to make sure we watch the snoopers ... just like they are watching us. You can be sure the Sun will be on guard.\" </p> <p><b> Roger Scruton</b><br> Daily Mail, August 17  </p> <p>\"Are we really moving towards some kind of totalitarian state? My answer is yes, perhaps we are, but not because of these proposals ... rather because today's legislators are increasingly unable or unwilling to recognise the boundary between the business of the state and the business of the citizen ... </p> <p>\"In almost every area, the recent expansion of the law has involved an attempt to put legal norms in place of social norms. The consequence is a withering away of community, an undermining of family sentiment and a demoralisation of society ... </p> <p>\"One by one, the spontaneous institutions of society, from funfairs and country shows to school trips, fireworks parties and church services, are being killed off by legislation or political correctness.\" </p> <p><b> Oliver Kamm </b><br> Times, August 17  </p> <p>\"The information commissioner holds a useful but limited post ... But he appears to have set out to discredit it through trivial observation couched in extravagant rhetoric ... </p> <p>\"None of the main parties shows much seriousness in this discussion ... Yet ironically it is the pedestrian quality of [their] interventions that provides reassurance that the issue is marginal ... Lacking sharply defined ideological differences, Westminster politics has little sense of the malign, let alone totalitarian, as opposed to illiberal or merely incompetent, exercise of power ... The more our public servants talk of totalitarianism without really meaning it, the less serious will that threat be taken.\"</p>",
  "It is billed as \"the loveliest castle in the world\", a moated, fairytale concoction where black swans swim in formation and Cliff Richard and Donny Osmond play live at sunset. But as Chinook helicopters swooped over the duck pond at Leeds Castle in Kent this week, corridors hung with military paraphernalia from centuries ago were being readied for an exasperated Tony Blair's latest drive to secure the Northern Ireland peace process. <p>Next month Mr Blair will bring the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, and Northern Ireland's polarised political parties to the romantic castle near Maidstone in an attempt to thrash out the deal of all deals to restore devolution. If he gets it right he will have rescued his greatest legacy - the Good Friday agreement - and begun to repair his tarnished reputation. </p> <p>Mr Blair's love of symbolism - his awareness of history and his own place in it - could not be more obvious in his choice of location for the three-day talks. The castle's sumptuous boudoir-turned-seminar room was the scene of 1978 negotiations between Egypt, Israel and the US which led to the historic Camp David agreement. </p> <p>But while Israeli flags flap on loyalist streets in Belfast and Palestinian flags hang on the nationalist Falls Road, marking the old sectarian divisions, Mr Blair is aiming for a once unthinkable political arrangement. Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party, the biggest party in Northern Ireland, must sit down in a power-sharing government with the biggest nationalist party, Sinn F\u00e9in, if the peace process is to move forward. </p> <p><b> Ambiguity</b><br> </p> <p>The DUP will not negotiate directly with Sinn F\u00e9in until the IRA is disbanded as a paramilitary force. Indeed, there will be no direct talks between the two parties in the castle's narrow, panelled rooms. Observers have spoken of an \"outside chance\" of progress. </p> <p>But the Sinn F\u00e9in president, Gerry Adams, has stolen the thunder in recent weeks by indicating that the IRA could disband. Mr Adams has spoken before of taking the gun out of Irish politics, but he is a master of ambiguity. This time, political commentators felt he was sending the clearest signal yet that he was preparing his supporters for the day the IRA might leave the stage. He appeared to be saying goodbye to what some see as the cherished republican strategy of the Armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other. </p> <p>Mr Adams said unionist politicians were exploiting \"justifiable fears\" about the IRA and using them as an \"excuse\" not to share power with Sinn F\u00e9in. \"I think that republicans need to be prepared to remove that as an excuse,\" he told the Irish state broadcaster, RTE. Mr Adams said any progress hinged on devolving powers over Northern Ireland's reformed police service from London to Belfast. He said the army in Northern Ireland - currently numbering more troops than in Iraq - must be scaled back, the government must stop \"protecting\" human rights abusers, and on-the-run republicans should be allowed to return home. </p> <p>As all parties prepared their positions for the talks this week, the DUP's deputy leader, Peter Robinson, has played down chances of a quick deal, saying he needs to \"weigh the semtex\" and not Gerry Adams's words. He ruled out devolving policing powers in the near future. While nationalists want the implementation of the Good Friday agreement, the DUP seeks to scrap the agreement and start again. </p> <p>Mr Blair has threatened to dissolve the Stormont assembly if no agreement is reached in September. Anniversaries are creeping up on him. It is 10 years since the first IRA ceasefire. Stormont has lain empty for almost two years since it was suspended after allegations of an IRA spy ring. It is almost a year since the assembly elections polarised Northern Ireland politics, with the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in doing their best to kill off the middle ground. </p> <p>But Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP MP for Lagan Valley, has been appearing on platforms all summer making speeches that suggest a deal is possible - first in his address to a field of Orangemen on July 12, then on a platform with Sinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness across the border in Donegal. Last week he ignored security advice and attended a public meeting in west Belfast. With Gerry Adams in the audience, he said that if the impasse in the peace process was to be broken, IRA decommissioning would have to be completed within a defined timescale. Ideally it would happen before Christmas, he said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, locals in the heart of Ann Widdecombe's Tory constituency were bemused by the choice of venue for the talks. </p> <p>One retired businessman from Ashford said locals might picket the talks, insisting the prime minister returns to \"more pressing issues\", such as asylum seekers. </p> <p>Deirdre Diggins, assistant manager of the pub next door to the castle, was from Kerry. She sighed: \"Even if they do make a deal, what's it going to change exactly? We will have to see proof it will work.\" </p> <p>Leeds Castle's prized collection of antique dog collars might strike fear into the DUP, which is adamant it will not be led by the neck into government with \"terrorists\". The ivory carving of Augustus the Strong's overfed whippet might symbolise the \u00a336.6m spent on Stormont since its suspension, infuriating voters. </p> <p>But Leeds Castle, for all its beauty, is largely fake: a confection of mock Tudor courtyards and hidden staircases. The one thing Northern Ireland parties do not want is a short-term mocked-up deal that will collapse in six months. The Stormont assembly has already been suspended four times. A dangerous scenario, said David Ford of the Alliance party, was a \"simple quick fix\" to rush the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in into government together.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>PASSING CONCERN</b></p> <p>You can guess the results. The A-level pass rate rose to 96% this year - the 22nd successive improvement and, everyone agrees, a sign that something really ought to be done.</p> <p>At this rate, the market for lucrative Clearing supplements and front-page advertisements for tutorial colleges is going to disappear altogether. The Independent alone publishes 110 pages of vacant courses and university ads. (The Wrap's favourite plugs a degree called \"Outdoor Studies\" at Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College.)</p> <p>Still, back to the essays. Everyone comes up with their own ideas for tampering with the A-level sieve. \"Grade inflation is a reality,\" says the FT. \"Examination boards should reveal the exact marks achieved by their candidates.\" The introduction of a starred A-grade for the top 5% - an approach favoured by the Times - is a \"measly alternative\".</p> <p>There is also talk of a 4,000-word \"super essay\", which university applicants could post online for the edification of admissions tutors, in the Times.</p> <p>\"Is Grade C now the new pass mark?\" wonders the Mail, which says around 10% of English literature candidates misspell the name of their subject. </p> <p>The FT complains that students are choosing \"soft subjects\" such as psychology at the expense of modern languages and physics in an effort to secure the grades they need for university. Only 2% of A-levels were in French this year and 3.7% in physics; media studies represented 3.5% of the total entries and religious studies 1.9%.</p> <p>The Independent, however, is determinedly positive. Boys' results are beginning to catch up with girls', it says, and the popularity of religious studies reflects the interest in Islam prompted by the September 11 attacks. Teenagers are showing signs of a \"growing interest ... in alternatives to the materialism that surrounds them.\" Perhaps it will help them take their minds off their student debts. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Education/alevels2004/story/0,14505,1286134,00.html\">Row over 'no-fail' A-levels</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Education/alevels2004/story/0,14505,1285925,00.html\">Media studies up, sciences down</a><br> * <a href=\"http://education.independent.co.uk/news/story.jsp?story=552917\">Independent: A for achievement (and astonishment)</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/693e6924-f17c-11d8-95b8-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Laddish culture celebrating flops wanes</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1223117,00.html\">Times: New A-level 'super-essay'</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,542-1222495,00.html\">Times: Ministers should introduce an A* for the A-level</a></p> <p><b> FORCES PREPARE FOR NAJAF ASSAULT</b></p> <p>Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army showed no signs of retreating from the shrine in the holy city of Najaf yesterday, the Times reports.

  "<p>Real Madrid teammates David Beckham and Michael Owen each scored in England's 3-0 victory over Ukraine. </p> <p>Beckham and Owen notched the first two with substitute Shaun Wright-Phillips scoring in his first international match for England. </p> <p>Beckham gave England a 1-0 lead in the 27th minute, scoring his 14th goal for England - but only his third in open play. </p> <p>Beckham, hoping to atone for a poor European championship two months ago, raced into the box and connected with his sliding right foot off a cross from defender John Terry on the right wing. </p> <p>The goal came after both sides played an even first 20 minutes with both teams playing free-flowing football. After the goal, England began to take control. </p> <p>Owen made it 2-0 in the 50th, latching on to Beckham's ball. Beckham, out on the right wing, broke to the centre of the pitch and launched a perfect cross that Owen headed home from close range. </p> <p>Substitute Wright-Phillips scored on his debut for England, notching an impressive goal in the 72nd as he embarked on a mazy run and then scored a sharp-angled shot.</p>",
  "<p><strong>9.35pm </strong>Paul Hamm gets the gold in the gymnastics. A brilliant last round sees him become the first American man to win the all-round competition. South Korean duo Kim Dae-eun and Yang Tae-young have to settle for silver and bronze respectively. A great night's action, probably better to watch than read about. </p> <p>Oh, and in (non-Olympic) baseball Barry Bonds is closing in on Babe Ruth's total number of home runs. Hank Aaron holds the record, everyone knows that. Anyway, I have a website to edit, so will bid you farewell, thanks for all the (six) emails. Cheers, Tom.</p> <p> <strong>9.25pm </strong>What a night at the gymnastics. Paul Hamm has clawed his way back to third, behind Brett McClure, also of America, and a South Korean whose name escapes me leads (poor journalism). Yang Wei is down in fourth after slipping on the high bar. Can no one hold a lead in the Olympics? Ravi emails back to confirm he is from India. Brilliant detective work from me.</p> <p>Richard from New York writes to ask why we're not discussing Barry Bonds closing in on Babe Ruth's home run record. Well, we are now, Dicky. Go, Barry.</p> <p> <strong>9.10pm</strong> Ha, Costa Rica have knocked Portugal out of the football, storming to a 4-2 victory. Alex Ferguson will be pleased that Ronaldo's trip to Greece was completely wasted.</p> <p>Ravichandra Ramineni writes in to nominate his nation as the worst at the Olympics: 1 billion people and one silver medal. But he doesn't say what nation he's from. 1 billion people and an Indian sounding name? I'm guessing India.</p> <p>Yang Wei now heads the gymnastics ahead of Ioan Silviu Sucliu of Romania. </p> <p><strong>8.55pm </strong>Heralded by cries of \"Rubbish!\" around the Guardian office, Paul Hamm crumples on landing on the vault and slips from first to fifth in the men's gymnastics. He looks gutted. Kieron Dyer knows how he feels, he's being booed everytime he touches the ball in the (non-Olympic) football.</p> <p><strong>8.46pm</strong> Amazing. My trip to the canteen has yielded a beef ghoulash with no beef. What do you have to do to get a decent meal around here? And I've managed to cut my finger. Bah, what would Leslie have to say about this travesty? Over in the men's gymnastics America's Paul Hamm leads the all-round event from Yang Wei of China. </p> <p>The medals ceremony for the equestrian team event goes ahead. Princess Anne (she does a lot of work for charity) hands over the medals to her horsey chums. Bit of confusion as the riders try and figure out whether the laurel rings go over their helmets or under them. Why are they still wearing their helmets anyway? Do they fear a royal beating? The camera pans to a sinister huddle of Americans and Frenchmen plotting an appeal against golden girl Bettina Hoy.</p> <p>Clare Balding joins Leslie in the judge-bashing and says a pony club could organise a better event. Go Clare, give it to them girlfriend.</p> <p><strong>8.34pm </strong> Oh, and England are one-nil up in the (non-Olympic) football, if anyone is interested. David Beckham scuffing one home.</p> <p><strong>8.30pm</strong> By god, emails! Richard Noble decides to put in a bit of the Leslie Laws and complains about Canada's measly medal haul - a rather pathetic one bronze from a nation of 30m people beefed up on a diet of bear meat and maple syrup. You have my complete sympathy, Richard. Anybody else like to nominate a nation of under-achievers?</p> <p><strong>8.10 pm </strong>Australia have beaten Japan 97-78 in the women's basketball and top their group, USA have proved to be better than their bumbling male colleagues and powered to victory against South Korea.</p> <p> <strong>7.55pm </strong>Leslie Law is interviewed after his triumph and doesn't look too pleased. He grumbles about the officials and judging. Cheer up, man, you're a national hero. </p> <p><strong>7.52pm </strong> Plucky Chinese weightlifter Zhang Guozheng has taken gold in the 69kg category despite straining his back. </p> <p>Meanwhile, back at the hotbed of intrigue and subterfuge that calls itself the showjumping competition, our very own Leslie Law moves ahead of Pippa Funnell after a clear final round and swipes himself a shiny silver, after the Frenchman who was in first completely bottles it. Amazing. God bless our toffs! Whirlwind of controversy Bettina Hoy finishes with the gold. Please let this be the end of the matter.</p> <p><strong>7.33pm </strong>Bah, the powers that be in the equestrian world have decided that Bettina Hoy is innocent of any horse-related chicanery and Germany have been reinstated in gold medal position, so we're down to bronze again. America and France have forgotten their squabble over Iraq and have launched a counter appeal. Like Patrick Vieira transfer rumours this one could run and run...</p> <p><strong>7.20pm</strong> Equestrian update: Germany have appealed against Bettina Hoy's points deduction, but for now the British team have the silver medal and Pippa Funnell is on for a bronze in the individual competition. Who says there's no point in the aristocracy?</p> <p><strong>7.10pm </strong>The USA smash the world record to win the women's 200m freestyle relay, with China in second and Germany in third. Britain finish a respectable fifth. In the women's badminton semi-finals Mia Audina of the Netherlands beats Gong Ruina of China 11-4 11-2 and Zhang Ning beat her Chinese compatriot Zhou Mi 11-6 11-4.</p> <p><strong>6.45 pm </strong>Michael Phelps eases to a win in the first semi-final of the 200m medley, while Laszlo Cseh takes the second one ahead of George Bovel, who continues Trinidad's proud swimming tradition. GB's Adrian Turner comes home in eighth. Adrian Moorhouse reckons Phelps will take the gold easily in the final.</p> <p><strong>6.30pm </strong>What a fantastic race. Pieter van den Hoogenband takes the gold, Roland Mark Schoeman the silver, and the Thorpedo the bronze. Schoeman was ahead on world record time at the turn, but tired near the end to allow Van den Hoogenband to clinch it in the final stroke. Thorpe came back from eighth at the turn to snatch third place. Van den Hoogenband looks almost as chuffed as me after my tips in the previous update.</p> <p>It has been confirmed that Germany have been docked 12 penalty points in the three-day eventing, meaning Britain officially have the silver medal. We await to see if Germany appeal.</p> <p><strong>6.20pm </strong> It seems the German rider Bettina Hoy has been docked 12 points for crossing the start-line twice during the showjumping, pushing her team down to fourth. \"Crossing the start-line twice?\" I hear you say. No, I don't quite understand either. The Germans have the right to appeal, though, so watch this space.</p> <p>Polish swimmer Otylia Jedrzejczek (it's at times like these I'm glad I'm not a commentator) has won the 200m butterfly. It's the big one coming up now - the 100m freestyle for men. The field is wide open, though Ian Thorpe and Pieter van den Hoogenband are the pre-race favourites. Roland Mark Schoeman is a good outside bet for South Africa.</p> <p><strong>6.05pm </strong> Great Britain have been awarded the silver medal in the three-day eventing. The whole affair is shrouded in mystery at present, but Germany have been wiped from the leaderboard, pushing France into gold medal position, and Britain into second. As Barry Davies once famously said: \"Where were the Germans? Quite frankly, who cares?\" I'll let you know the explanation when I find out.</p> <p>In the pool, James Goddard has produced another excellent swim to win his semi-final in the 200m backstroke by a full body-length, breaking the British record (1:57.25) while he was at it. However, he will struggle to win the final, as there he will come up against American Adam Peirsol, who set an Olympic record (1:55.14) in the second semi-final.</p> <p>Ben Atherton, meanwhile, is livid. \"Arrch, I hate the phrase Team GB,\" he begins. \"It's so weak and pathetic, kind of like something Tim Henman might support - Go Team! Yeah! Rubbish.\" Yes, Ben, I see your point, and I will subsequently refrain from using it again.</p> <p><strong>5.50pm </strong> Jonathan Wood says this: \"I can't believe I'm the only one who thinks Paula Radcliffe is gorgeous.\" Well, I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say \"gorgeous\", Jonathan. Mind you, my colleague Rob Smyth reckons she looked \"radiant\" on the BBC Sports Personality of the Year show. </p> <p>Speaking of \"radiant\", Venus Williams has just been knocked out of the women's singles, losing 6-4, 6-4 to Mary Pierce.</p> <p>Ooh, and a world record to tell you about in the pool: Aussie Jodie Henry has just set a new best in the second semi-final of the 100m freestyle with a time of 53.52. She looked as shocked as everyone else.</p> <p><strong>5.40pm </strong> Japan's Kosuke Kitajima has won the men's breaststroke 200m final, his second gold medal of the Games after his win in the 100m. Daniel Gyurta was second for Hungary, and Brendan Hansen third for America. There were no Britons in the race, but we have James Goddard and Gregor Tait coming up shortly in the men's 200m backstroke semi-finals - both looked impressive in the heats this morning.</p> <p>Julie O'Neill says regarding the UK Olympic top totty: \"There's no contest, it's got to be James Cracknell.\" I'll take your word for it, Julie.</p> <p><strong>5.25pm</strong> \"Surely for 2012 we could push for the inclusion of mixed doubles synchronized archery horseback riding?\" Ben Roome, this does indeed sound the perfect sport for team GB. Richard Frampton has plumped for British triathlete Jodie Swallow (I'll leave the obvious gags to you) for his pick of the British girls, while Geoff Spick goes for Lauren Jackson, who is actually in the Aussie women's basketball team, and therefore doesn't strictly qualify for this category. </p> <p>By the way, nothing is happening at the moment, but the swimming is coming up soon, with the men's and women's 100m freestyle finals, and the women's 4x200m freestyle relay - in which we have a realistic chance of a medal - to look forward to.</p> <p><strong>5.08pm </strong> Barnaby Champman has posed an interesting question, asked in true Men Behaving Badly style: \"Top UK Olympic totty?\" Leonie Pendred thought Nathan Robertson was a fitty, and Barnaby reckons his partner Gail Emms is the best British candidate. They are clearly quite the handsome couple. Any other views? </p> <p>'Desperate' Phil Walker, on the other hand, wants to know: \"If the olympics had medals for 4th and 5th places, what do people think they should be made of (tin and wood perhaps), and how many more medals would GB have - my guess is loads judging by all the near misses we are getting.\" Maybe, but our athletes would probably contrive to finish sixth just to ensure they narrowly miss out on medals - there's nothing we Brits like more than a glorious failure.</p> <p>So I can't be accused of providing you purely with meaningless chit-chat, Yuriy Silonog has won the men's shot put final, beating American Adam Nelson into second.</p> <p><strong>4.55pm </strong> More good news from the sailing venue at Piraeus. The British teams lead in three classes and are second in one other. Ben Ainslie maintained his lead with a third place this afternoon, while his nearest rival, Spaniard Rafael Trujillo, was disqualified. Shirley Robertson, Sarah Ayton and Sarah Webb are seven points clear in the gold medal position in the Yngling class. And Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield finished third in their second race of the day to move six points ahead of the USA duo. Chris Draper and Simon Hiscocks, meanwhile, have moved into second in the mixed 49er on their second day of competition.</p> <p>Andy Roddick has become the latest tennis superstar to be knocked out, losing in straight sets to Fernando Gonzalez, of Chile, in the third round. With Roger Federer already eliminated, the men's singles is wide open. If only Tim Henman was still in, eh?</p> <p><strong>4.38pm </strong> <strong> BRONZE MEDAL FOR GREAT BRITAIN</strong> Well, they didn't get the gold, but the British three-day eventing team has had an excellent result by winning the bronze medal after being out of contention just half an hour ago. American Kimberly Severson hit the last fence to give the Brits third place, while Frenchman Nicolas Touzaint did likewise to gift the gold to Germany, for whom Bettina Hoy rode a perfect round. Oh, and my colleagues now think I'm a bit odd because I was shouting at the television cheering our girls and boys on. Nothing wrong with a bit of patriotic spirit, that's what I say! Pippa Funnell goes into the final round of the individual showjumping tonight with a chance of a medal. She is in fourth place overall, with Leslie law in fifth. This is proving to be quite a day.</p> <p><strong>4.28pm </strong> Pippa Funnell has had an outstanding double clear run on Primmore's Pride and William Fox Pitt has declared we are still in with a chance of a team gold (yes, gold) medal in the showjumping. All the other contenders are dropping like flies, and if any of the three riders to go hit a fence, we are guaranteed a medal. Exciting. Funnell also has a chance for an individual medal.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Sam Wingfield is taking up a new career. \"Inspired by the bronze medal glory in archery me and a mate have just gone down the bus station with a beer mat,\" he says. \"Wish us luck.\" Best of British, Sam, or perhaps, just good luck.</p> <p><strong>4.18pm </strong> The cycling had indeed begun, in fact, it's actually just finished. Tyler Hamilton has taken the gold.</p> <p>Andrew Goldsby wants to know what we are going to do when we run out of excuses over Britain's poor performances. \"From the coverage I saw yesterday the three day horsey stuff went to pot because the cross country course didn't suit British horses and it was hot. Should we get the games in 2012 just who exactly are we going to blame?\" Good question. The likelihood is though that we won't get the Games, then we'll just be able to blame absolute everyone - it could be the biggest conspiracy theory of all time. </p> <p> <strong>4.05pm </strong> <strong>BRONZE MEDAL FOR GREAT BRITAIN</strong> Alison Williamson has beaten Chinese Taipei's Shu Chi Yuan 105-104 to win the archery 70m bronze medal in her fourth Olympics. To hit the bullseye is like hitting a beer mat from seven buses away apparently. I think it's easier to pitcure it by saying it's 70m. Anyway, Williamson did it very often, so well done to her.</p> <p>Britain's Leslie Law has had a double clear run in the showjumping, meaning we are still in with a chance of a team bronze medal with Pippa Funnell the last rider to go.</p> <p>The first athletics medal of the Games has been won by Irina Korzhanenko of Russia in the women's shot put. Oh, and the men's cycling time trial has begun with Jan Ulrich and Tyler Hamilton two of the favourites.</p> <p><strong>3.51pm </strong> The showjumping is not going well at all. Since the commentator said he wanted the Germans to fail miserably, they have gone from strength to strength and and to the top of the leaderboard. The French are faltering with America breathing down their necks in the hunt for second place. Britain remain fourth, with Australia close behind. There are two riders to go for each team.</p> <p>Bruce Jackson has unwittingly come up with a way of making archery an even more watchable sport. \"This one-on-one archery business,\" he begins. \"Do they line up 70m apart with balloons full of coloured dye attached to themselves? Then start loosing off arrows until one of them starts leaking a red colour?\" They don't, Bruce, but it's a mighty fine idea. Maybe you should contact the IOC and suggest it for Beijing 2008.</p> <p>Winston Gordon's semi-final conqueror, Zurab Zviadauri, has beaten small Japanese martial expert Hiroshi Izumi with another ippon to win the gold medal.</p> <p><strong>3.42pm </strong> Not an update for British cheer I'm afraid. Alison Williamson has lost her archery semi-final 110-100 to the Korean Park, despite her best performance of the Games so far. Williamson now faces Shu Chi Yuan in a battle for a bronze medal, while the final will be an all Korean affair.</p> <p>Winston Gordon has lost his judo bronze medal play-off with Mark Huizinga, of Holland, after the Dutchman achieved an ippon in the 90kg category.</p> <p><strong>3.30pm </strong> Hello again everybody. The showjumping is the key event of the afternoon, it being the third day of the three-day eventing and all. Medals will be dished out later, and Britain lay in fourth going into the day with Pippa Funnell leading team GB. The BBC commentator has just said he hopes those teams above us start losing time and pick up penalty points, including the Germans. Not sure such tub-thumping is necessary. Anyway, as of yet it hasn't happened, and it looks like Britain will miss out on the medals despite supposedly having the best riders and the best horses.</p> <p>Archer Alison Williamson's semi-final, and the chance to win a medal is up soon, but it won't be easy as her opponent, Sung Hyun Park, is the favourite for the title.</p> <p>Meanwhile, someone certainly agrees that badminton is sexy. \"Move aside Beckham!\" orders Leonie Pendred. \"Nathan (Robertson) is a FITTY!! And when he does that jumping smash, phwoooar!\" Well, quite.</p> <p><strong>3.15pm</strong> This is a moment for Professor Robert Winston if ever I stumbled across one: neanderthal man has just emailed me! \"I always thought badmington was what you did at school for P.E. if you were too soft for real man sport like rugger and soccer outside,\" says Tom Gray. \"Who cares if we get a gold medal.\" I've been advised that the best way to communicate with Tom is \"ug ug ug.\" </p> <p>Back to horsey business, Jeanette Brakewell is currently in second in the showjumping after picking up only four faults and finishing within time.</p> <p>Meanwhile in the judo Winston Gordon has missed out on the silver or gold thanks to some Georgian fellow, and will have to buck his ideas up to fight it out for the bronze. </p> <p>That's it from me, Mike Adamson will be back at 3.30pm. Cheerio.</p> <p><strong>3pm</strong> In classic Henman fashion Robertson's reined in the anger and used it to their advantage, fist pumping his way from 8-5 down to 12-12 and then the Brits pulled away to take the match with a 15-12 second game win. That's at least silver in the bag! Fist pump-o-rama!</p> <p>\"Am I mad or have I woken up in an alternate dimension where badminton is cool hip and sexy?\" asks Jason Moncrieff. There's a medal in it Jason, badminton will now be cool hip and sexy for at least the next four years.</p> <p>America's Kim Rhode has won gold in the women's double trap, by the way. I thought you'd be wondering.</p> <p><strong>2.45pm</strong> Alison Williamson's gone through in the archery, beating He Ying 109-89. The Chinese archer took her ninth arrow out of turn, and while protesting at missing out on her highest score as a penalty, she missed her 10th. Oh dear.</p> <p>In the badminton the Brits stormed to win 15-6 in the first game, but they're 8-5 down in the second - an iffy decision has prompted Nathan's red mist and they're getting a wee bit wound up.</p> <p><strong>2.30pm</strong> Emms and Robertson have absolutely catapulted out the blocks and are winning 10-4. A couple of questionable line calls but Emms' ferocious net play has got the Danes looking a little scared.</p> <p>Unlike their male counterparts, the American basketball girls have managed a hefty win over South Korea, beating them 80-57.</p> <p>\"Any news on whether Paula Radcliffe is actually injured or not?\" asks Keys Avris. Only the denial so far, we'll keep you posted.</p> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> Woohoo! It looks like the BBC will be treating us to Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson's meeting with Danish mixed doubles badminton pair Rasmussen and Olsen after all, they're just warming up as I type. The Brits have beaten them before, but the first point goes to the Danes.</p> <p>Cycling results as demanded by Matthew Gibson: Nicola Cook finished 19th, just a smidge away from that \"guaranteed\" medal, and has dropped out of the track events, presumably to go and pout somewhere.</p> <p><strong>2pm</strong> \"Tedious Fact of the Day,\" announces Andrew Goldsby, a sure-fire way to get anyone to open an email. \"Yngling is Norwegian for youngling the original Norwegian designer of the boat designed it for his younglings.\" You can almost hear him drone it, can't you? In Athens, meanwhile, the Beeb are ignoring the badminton mixed doubles and sticking with the archery, so I couldn't say how Emms and Robertson are getting on, but Alison Williamson is doing well in her quarter final so far...</p> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> \"One of Mike Adamson's last dispatches informed us that the British team is apparently doing well in something called Yngling,\" says Peter Morley, as if I wouldn't have been reading my colleague's coverage. Ahem. \"What the hell is Yngling? Sounds like a Welsh version of fishing to me.\"</p> <p>Sadly I'll have to dismiss that Peter, the international yngling association says it's a \"cross between a planing dinghy and a keelboat.\" There, that's cleared that up. No?</p> <p>I'm contractually obliged to bring you something results related, so how about the women's 25m pistol? I knew you'd be thrilled. Maria Grozdeva of Bulgaria won the gold, Czech Lenka Hykova took silver and Irada Ashumova of Azerbaijan took bronze.</p> <p><strong>1.30pm</strong> Despite lying fifth and generally being our best hope of a medal in the prancing around on horseback that is the three-day eventing, William Fox-Pitt has withdrawn due to a slight injury to Tamarillo. All seems a bit precious to me, especially since it means overall Britian will slip from third to fourth, but then I never did understand horsey types. \"Couldn't he just rope in another horse?\" asks Stu Cory, and I'm seconding it.</p> <p>For the general athletics enthusiast, some good news: Haile Gebrselassie says he will race despite a leg injury because the Olympics is such a big event. \"If it was any other race I wouldn't have come. It only comes round once every four years,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>1.15pm</strong> Afternoon. We'll start things off as we mean to go on: a random comedy moment that doesn't technically leave you that much better informed. American swimmer Kara Lynn Joyce, who qualified second for the women's 100m freestyle semi final, reckons she was given a head start by... a bee. Apparently the little critter was buzzing around her feet, hence her reaction time of 0.71s off the blocks. </p> <p>For those who wish to be informed, Swedish duo Jan-Ove Waldner and Jorgen Persson have pulled off a shock! victory over Chinese team Kong Linghui and Wang Hao in the men's doubles table tennis. The Swedes \"were lucky\", according to the Chinamen.</p>",
  "<p>Great Britain's three-day eventing team were celebrating tonight after Leslie Law claimed a silver medal in the individual showjumping. Germany's Stroud-based rider Bettina Hoy took the gold. Philippa Funnell finished just outside the medals in fourth.</p> <p>The Brits have been on something of a rollercoaster ride all day. Initially the team were celebrating after being upgraded from the bronze to the silver medal position in the team event after Hoy incurred 12 penalty points for crossing the start-line twice during the show-jumping, causing the Germans to plummet from first to fourth place in the overall standings.</p> <p>However, the German team then launched an appeal against the judges' decision, which had reduced the otherwise impeccable Hoy to floods of tears. After some deliberation, it was decided that the appeal should be upheld, thereby restoring the original standings. </p> <p>To be fair, the British team would probably have been happy with bronze at the start of a day which dawned with news of an injury to William Fox-Pitt's horse, Tamarillo. Fox-Pitt was, therefore, forced to withdraw from the competition.</p> <p>However, the remaining four riders in the team, Law, Funnell, Mary King and Jeanette Brakewell rose to the challenge, with Funnell and Law riding clear rounds in the team showjumping.</p> <p>Funnell, who endured a wretched day yesterday, was understandably delighted, saying: \"I'm very relieved because we were just gutted last night in the camp. It's a huge relief today that we've come back and got a medal.</p> <p>\"Leslie jumped well and I was delighted with my horse. It's just annoying we didn't claw our way back even further. I think we all came out wanting [gold], but horses aren't machines. Every course is different and every competition is different.</p> <p>\"If William (Fox-Pitt) was able to jump it could have been a different story.\"</p>",
  "<p> As a child, Lin Ju lay in bed at his parents' home in the Fujian province of China and dreamt of representing his country in the Olympic Games. Yesterday at the Galatsi Hall, the venue for the table tennis competition, that dream came true almost exactly as he had imagined it. Only the country had changed. </p> <p>Lin, 24, is the Dominican Republic's sole representative in the men's table tennis competition. His compatriot in the women's draw bears the equally un-Hispanic name of Wu Xue, and together the China-born pair carry the hopes of the central American republic, and in particular its president Rafael Hispolito, who was instrumental in ensuring they competed in Athens under the red, white and blue flag of his country. </p> <p>Yesterday Lin produced one of the shocks of the competition so far, progressing to the last 16 with a 4-2 victory over the Belgian Jean-Michel Saive, ranked 16th in the world to Lin's 137th. The result was the talk of the hall with some experts hailing the emergence of a new star, but Lin's win again raised concerns, not least among the sport's governing body, about the prevalence of China-born players competing under alien flags. </p> <p>Players born in China occupy the No1 spots in Luxembourg, Italy, Austria and the US, and there are 14 playing under flags of convenience in Athens. It is a reflection of the huge influence the world's most populous nation wields over the Olympics' most homely event, which will move to the centre of the games in Beijing in four years' time. </p> <p>The reason that so many Chinese seek asylum in the colours of other nations lies in the strength of the competition at home. Five of the top 10 men in the world are Chinese, and six of the top women. With such enormous strength in depth few but the very elite can expect to reach an Olympics. </p> <p>Such is the dominance of the Chinese that the International Table Tennis Federation has amended its qualifying regulations to give the rest of the world a chance. Only three competitors from any country are permitted to play, a rule that has deprived the tournament of six of the world's top 20 women and four of the men. </p> <p>The doubles regulations have also been altered with teams from the same country starting in the same side of the draw so that they cannot meet in the final. The ITTF maintains that the rule applies to all, but its intention is plainly to keep the Chinese apart lest team orders undermine the final. </p> <p>The federation and the International Olympic Committee regulations are designed to prevent a mercenary culture taking hold, demanding that competitors bear a passport from the country they wish to represent, and that they have not competed for another nation for three years. </p> <p>Nevertheless there are cases that cause disquiet, and Lin's is one. Two years ago he left China, frustrated at failing to break into the national team after being employed as a hitting partner for the elite players. </p> <p>From Fujian he travelled to stay with a friend in Spain, where he soon impressed playing in league competitions in and around Cordoba. It was here that he was spotted by the chairman of the Dominican Republic table tennis federation, on the look-out for talent that could be imported to Santa Domingo. </p> <p>Lin accepted the chairman's offer and as he had no international experience the only barrier to participation in Athens was a passport. For that the table tennis authorities turned to President Hispolito. Under the Dominican Republic's constitution it is in the president's gift to award three passports each year, and in 2002 Lin and Wu Xue were the lucky recipients of two of them. </p> <p>Their swift naturalisation caused uproar when they won their respective competitions at the Pan-American games, but there was no breach of ITTF rules and they were free to continue to Athens. </p> <p>Lin rejects the accusation that he is a mercenary, but is frank about why he left China. \"I wanted to compete in an Olympic Games and that would have never happened if I stayed in China,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I still feel more Chinese than Dominican because of my cultural background, but the Dominican people are really nice to me and the other team members are really supportive. I am very happy with my performance.\" </p> <p>The small but noisy knot of supporters from his adopted home plainly had no problem supporting their man as his speed and touch confounded Saive, who in contrast to Lin carried Belgium's flag at the opening ceremony. A checked drop-shot that brought him match point after the pair traded driven forehands from the far reaches of the court demonstrated that while Lin's knowledge of Spanish may be shaky, he is eloquent enough at the table. </p> <p>In the next round, though, he meets Wang Hao, ranked three in China and four in the world. That match should give him a stiff reminder of why he left home in the first place.</p>",
  "An end to almost two weeks of fighting in Najaf today appeared to be in sight when delegates at a national convention in Baghdad said the radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr had agreed to their peace terms. <p>A peace delegation was yesterday sent to Najaf to offer Mr Sadr a political role in return for removing himself and his militia from the holy city's Imam Ali mosque.</p> <p>However, the delegation suffered an apparent snub when it waited for three hours without the cleric granting an audience.</p> <p>A senior aide to Mr Sadr, however, offered hope earlier today, telling Reuters: \"What we heard contains positive indications. We are willing to discuss them\".</p> <p>A letter from Mr Sadr's office in Baghdad, saying he had agreed to demands, was read out to the convention. His spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.</p> <p>Clashes in the city over the last fortnight have cost hundreds of lives, spreading instability to Shia districts of Baghdad and other predominately Shia cities such as Basra. The Najaf fighting has encroached on the Imam Ali mosque and holy Wadi al-Salam cemetery. Three British soldiers have been killed in Basra in the last week.</p> <p>Gunfire and explosions today echoed across Najaf's old town as US troops traded fire with militiamen in a no-man's land of alleyways and rooftops offering cover for snipers.</p> <p>The clashes - which today left 29 people either dead or injured, according to the city's main hospital - presented the interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, with a major dilemma ahead of elections in January. </p> <p>He needed to be seen to resolve the challenge to his authority, but could afford to enrage the country's Shia majority by using heavy-handed tactics near Najaf's shrines.</p> <p>Satellite television station al-Arabiya today reported that the Iraqi defence minister, Hazim al-Shaalan, was expecting a \"decisive battle\" to end the standoff in Najaf. However, similar claims had been made.</p> <p>The clashes continued to divided delegates at the convention in Baghdad, as it entered an unscheduled fourth day in its mission to appoint a national assembly to oversee the interim government.</p> <p>However, even as hopes of a truce in Najaf were raised, there was violence elsewhere in Iraq. A rocket hit a busy market in the northern city of Mosul, killing at least five civilians.</p> <p>The national convention, which includes religious and political leaders, is due to pick 81 candidates for a national assembly, with the remaining 19 coming from Iraq's now defunct governing council.</p> <p>The assembly will be able to veto legislation with a two-thirds majority, approve the 2005 budget and appoint a new prime minister or president should either resign or die in office.</p>",
  "Communist rebels today laid siege to the Nepalese capital, Katmandu, stopping road traffic by threatening to attack vehicles unless the government freed jailed guerrillas. <p>Katmandu valley has no rail links, and the 1.5 million people living there depend on trucks for fuel, food and supplies. </p> <p>The army said there had been only around 70 vehicles on a normally busy highway linking Katmandu to the southern plains bordering India, compared with 800 on a normal day. </p> <p>Today, children played on the road used to provide Katmandu with around 90% of its supplies, while cows, buffalo, chickens and dogs roamed across it.</p> <p>Brigadier Netra Bahadur Thapa told reporters that the military was escorting vehicles and had deployed more troops to patrol the highway. </p> <p>\"This call for a blockade is some kind of propaganda to scare people. There is no violence so far,\" he said. However, the truck drivers upon whom the Nepalese capital depends were less certain. One truck carrying construction stones to the city had its licence plates covered over. </p> <p>\"I am scared,\" the driver said. \"They may take note of the truck today and attack later. That is why I have covered the number plates.\" </p> <p>\"Who is going to take such a big risk?\" another truck driver, Mahesh Lama, asked. \"Even if we get protection today, they [rebels] could take action for refusing their order tomorrow or even next week.\" </p> <p>The only option available to most travellers was to go by air, although few in what is an impoverished nation can afford to fly. At the main bus station, hundreds of people were stranded because no vehicles were leaving the city. Insurgents were believed to be monitoring the roads, and drivers feared they would be attacked if they tried to use them. In the past, rebels have torched dozens of vehicles and planted mines on highways to enforce blockades. </p> <p>The rebels last week said they would attack vehicles for an indefinite period, beginning today. Earlier in the day, a bomb exploded in a busy market in southern Nepal, killing a 12-year-old boy and wounding six others, including three policemen. Officials suspect communist rebels were responsible for the blast.</p> <p>Some leading businesses in Nepal shut down earlier this week because of rebel threats, and the Soaltee Crowne Plaza, a popular luxury hotel in Katmandu, was bombed on Monday for defying rebel orders to close. </p> <p>The Home Ministry said it would deploy extra troops across the nation and on major highways in an effort to thwart today's threatened attacks, but the promise did not assure worried citizens. </p> <p>\"We have little money left, and we have no idea when we will be able to get home. We are going to starve and probably have to sleep out in the open,\" Rupesh Khatri, whose son was being treated at a Katmandu hospital, said. </p> <p>The Nepalese prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, yesterday called an emergency meeting of ministers, the army and the police to discuss the issue. Home Ministry spokesman Gopendra Pandey would not say today whether the government would meet the rebels' demands. </p> <p>Authorities also refuse to say how many rebels are in detention. Nepalese law allows soldiers to detain rebel suspects for 90 days without charge, but human rights groups claim many are kept much longer. </p> <p>The rebels, who say they are inspired by the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, have been fighting to replace Nepal's monarchy with a communist state since February 1996. The insurgency has claimed more than 9,500 lives. </p> <p>The last round of peace talks broke down in August last year after rebels walked out, accusing the government of failing to meet their demands. The government has repeatedly urged the rebels to resume peace talks since taking office in June, but they have not so far responded.</p>",
  "<p>Last week's BBC documentary, Nuseries Undercover, in which a reporter filmed ill-treatment of children, rekindled a ferocious debate among parents about childcare. It tapped into parents' deep-seated anxiety about leaving their children for many hours a day in the hands of people they barely know. Many parents, especially those whose children have been in nursery since they were less than a year old, probably found some scenes unwatchable. </p> <p>Child psychiatrist Dr Hamish Cameron says it is high time we re-evaluated our dependence on nursery care: \"The idea that has been put out is that the sooner the mother goes back to work, the better,\" he says. \"But nought to three is an important stage in the development of a child's sense of security and stability. They need personal care, not institutionalised care; they need someone reliable and predictable. If they don't get that, it can be very damaging.\" </p> <p>Why do we put our children, and ourselves, through this? We torment ourselves over leaving our children at nursery, but few of us are prepared to make the necessary financial adjustments to stay at home to look after them full time. This is partly because most nurseries are perfectly nice places for children to play. Parents like the idea that there are several carers on the premises, and that children can learn to play with others. </p> <p>But parents also like the idea that they can be parents and remain whole adult people, and this involves, for many, returning to work. The truth is that full-time childcare is beyond most of us. It is exhausting, emotionally draining, and rarely leaves one with a feeling of pride or achievement. </p> <p>When the debate is rekindled by programmes such as this, one wonders, will there come a moment when the trend tips towards parents staying at home? Part-time solutions are increasingly popular, but it will take time before many employers accept that fathers should be allowed to cut their hours. </p> <p>The latest debate may subside, but the big question hangs in the air: could you, would you, look after your own children? <strong> CL</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Sam Bryant, 36, lives with her partner, Andrew, and their 16-month-old daughter, Millie</strong> </p> <p>I went back to work when Millie was 10 months old. I kept putting it off because I couldn't bear to leave her. For the first few weeks I found the separation very traumatic. I went back to work because there was no choice - it was because we needed the money rather than to further my career. The biggest agony was finding someone for Millie who I felt completely comfortable with. I found a nursery that had been recommended and visited it at least three times with Millie before I left her there. </p> <p>I returned to work, and missed Millie dreadfully. I felt I wasn't being a true mum. I asked about going back part time but they didn't want me to do that, so in the end I left and got a job where I can work three days a week. I no longer feel terrible about leaving Millie because she has come on in leaps and bounds since starting nursery and gets so much out of it. They can give her more than I could - for example, we don't have a garden but the nursery does, and at nursery the staff can make things with them all the time, which I couldn't do all day long with her. Financially, if I had had a choice I probably wouldn't have gone back to work, but now I'm glad I did. Because I'm not with Millie all the time I really appreciate the time I have with her, and I enjoy working. </p> <p> <strong> Vicky Hall, 40, lives with her husband, Tim, and their son, Mark, three</strong> </p> <p>I wanted Mark to go to nursery at eight months, when I went back to work, but there wasn't a place. I found a childminder, which I was glad about: he had a nurturing, one-to-one arrangement. The creative scope was limited, but it was all he needed at the time. When he was two, I wanted him to have kids around him and a more structured environment. Mark really benefits from nursery: he is an only child, and he enjoys other adults' attention. </p> <p>There's no way I could look after Mark seven days a week. It's too exhausting. When I'm with him, I give him my all, and there is no space for me. When I go out to work, I'm fulfilling a need that is not fulfilled at home. I need adult time, and adult feedback about who I am. </p> <p>I love looking after Mark, it's the most stimulating thing there is, but if I did it full time, I would not be stimulating part of my brain. That said, if the childcare fell apart tomorrow, I'd give up work. </p> <p> <strong> Joe George, 44, lives with his wife, Carole, and children, Ed, five, and Lucy, three</strong> </p> <p>When our children were born we had a lot of discussions about the best way to look after them. In the end we decided that a nursery would be the best option for the children and would allow us to continue working. After the children had been at nursery for several months, a member of staff spoke out about physical and emotional abuse taking place there. Paintbrushes were being shoved down some of the children's throats and some of the children were physically restrained. We removed the children straight away. It was one of the most traumatic episodes in my life. We did a lot of soul searching and talked about moving closer to the children's grandparents. If you live in a community close to extended family and friends who can help out with childcare and give you some breaks, then it becomes an option not to work. In the end we decided to send the children to another nursery, which we were very happy with because we felt that the social aspects of nursery provided a lot of advantages for the children. </p> <p> <strong> Jenny O'Brien, 40, and her partner, Jim, both work full-time. Their daughter, Tillie, is four</strong> </p> <p>When Tillie was born I knew I would have to go straight back to work full time. We were both self-employed and I couldn't let work drop for a second. Two weeks after the birth I was travelling to meetings, seeing the maternity nurseduring my lunch break to feed the baby. I hadn't bonded with her at that stage, so it wasn't a problem. I was under pressure to earn money and I didn't feel bad about it. I would rather be working in the early days; I'm not that excited about changing nappies. It's when they get older that I think they need more of your time, so you can show them how the world works. </p> <p>We hired a nanny who was great for the first few months, but it began to go wrong after that. She was on the phone all the time, and she wouldn't tell me where she had been with my daughter. It got untenable, and she kept lying to us, so we sacked her. </p> <p>I was so scared and freaked out, I lost faith in nannies. I found a nursery run by a wonderful woman who was there every day, so nothing escaped her notice. It was brilliant. But I was working so hard, I couldn't cope with running the house: I needed a nanny to wash my daughter's clothes and cook her food, to tidy up her bedroom. But I was really happy to know that Tillie was safe. In fact it was so good that after we found another nanny, we kept her at the nursery for two days a week. </p> <p> <strong> Dennis Fallen, 44, lives with his wife, Anne, and 18-month-old daughter, Cara</strong> </p> <p>At the moment I'm working four nights on and four nights off, which enables me to care for Cara while my wife is out at work four days a week. Anne's mother helps out when the we can't cover the childcare. We work to improve our family's quality of life but we have to consider the effects on others: we don't like to ask my mother-in-law to look after Cara too much. </p> <p>I used to live in Scandinavia and there are high-quality, subsidised nurseries there to encourage women to continue with their careers. The rest of Europe is light-years ahead of us with regard to care for the family unit and consideration for the role of work in that. If I had the choice I would rather be at home bringing my daughter up. It's good fun watching her develop. </p> <p>A lot of parents share the view that they would rather be at home with young children if it was financially manageable. It is hard work, but I don't give a hoot about that - as a parent you have to get your priorities right. When families were bigger and communities were closer, it was much easier for sisters and brothers to look after each other's children so that parents got a bit of a time to themselves, but these days it's harder to do that. Society places more emphasis on freedom for parents and there's pressure on us to achieve something all the time. Looking after my daughter takes more out of me than going to work does, but at least caring for her is fulfilling. </p> <p> <strong> Karen Redpath, a television producer, had 10 years' professional experience before her first daughter was born 13 years ago</strong> </p> <p> I took six months' maternity leave, but the idea of giving up work indefinitely was not an attractive option. This was partly because we needed the money, but it was more than simply a practical necessity. I valued myself as a working person and I felt strongly that it was not a problem for women to work. While there were times when it was wonderful to spend all my time at home, it could be tedious and understimulating. I had defined myself by my working life and I didn't want to let that go. I feel I can be a very good parent without being at home all the time. </p> <p>We chose a private nursery, where our daughter was one of 10 children in the baby unit. I didn't realise quite how hard it would be to leave a six-month-old child in a nursery and we wondered whether we were doing the right thing. There was a lot of negative publicity at the time about nurseries, and that shook me, but it was a lovely place and she was being looked after by a wonderful woman who later worked for us as a nanny. I felt it was the right choice and all the evidence was that the environment was stable, secure and loving. </p> <p>Three years on, my partner, who is an author, works from home and collects the children from school. One of the many benefits of my continuing to work is that we've had equal experiences of parenting, which means the children are happy to be with both of us. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Some names have been changed.

  "<p><strong> Has being a prison officer helped your comedy?</strong> <br> It was good training for dealing with hecklers.</p> <p><strong> Why did you join the prison service?</strong> <br> My mum was a prison officer at Holloway [women's prison]. She made it sound like you were there to listen to people's stories and to help them, almost like a probation officer.</p> <p><strong> Was that your experience?</strong> <br> No. I was 21 and female in a male jail. At Pentonville, you'd get sexual insults shouted at you and you'd be sent filthy and disturbing letters.</p> <p><strong> How did you cope?</strong> <br> I drank a lot.</p> <p><strong> How did you get into comedy?</strong> <br> In 2001, I left the prison service, went to university to study law and started to write material. I was inspired by New Nation, the Guardian, the Times and the Sun. I used to just get up and do my material at the Comedy Store.</p> <p><strong> Why are there so few women comics?</strong> <br> I was the only female finalist in the BBC3 New Comedy Awards last year. It's not that there are no funny women, they just find it more difficult. I'm lucky; I'm 6ft tall and have a bit of a presence. Other female comics get a hard time from the male audience.</p> <p><strong> Who makes you laugh?</strong> <br> Paul Merton and US comic Chris Rock.</p> <p><strong> Do you do jokes about being a black person?</strong> <br> A few, like where I went to boarding school there weren't even enough black people for a police line-up.</p> <p><strong> What's your show at Edinburgh?</strong> <br> Bling Blush Bonk is three women comedians who don't do jokes about periods.

  "<p>Thousands more staff at British Airways today voted to strike over the bank holiday weekend in a dispute over pay.</p> <p>The Transport and General Workers Union's 8,000 members will stage a 24-hour walkout on August 27, creating havoc for those planning to leave on holiday for the long weekend. The union's chief negotiator said 66% of check-in, sales and administrative staff and 84% of baggage handlers and other ground staff had voted in favour of industrial action. </p> <p>\"Each one of those votes is an employee of British Airways who has said, 'I've had enough,'\" the TGWU's chief negotiator, Brendan Gold, told a news conference this afternoon. </p> <p>Last week BA's 3,000 workers from the GMB union narrowly voted for a 24-hour strike scheduled to begin on either August 27, 28, 29 or 30.</p> <p>Mr Gold said he realised the travelling public would be seriously inconvenienced, but said his staff had been patient over the course of long negotiations and their patience had run out. </p> <p>\"We want a realistic settlement for the members. We started our negotiations eight months ago, and we haven't seen the company move toward us,\" he said. </p> <p>Yesterday BA made a bid to avert the strikes by offering a \u00a31000 bonus to staff who took fewer than 17 days off sick over the next three years. Today, Mr Gold said that offer was unacceptable. </p> <p>\"How do I say to someone who has had flu or had an accident at work and loses \u00a31000, how do I say that is a fair settlement?\" he asked. </p> <p>\"This vote was based on an offer which has since been substantially improved. It would be absurd for the unions to go ahead with a strike on the basis of an old offer.\" said BA's director of operations, Mike Street.</p> <p>\"Our staff must have an opportunity to make themselves heard on the new, substantially improved offered.\" </p> <p>The TGWU says that basic earnings for baggage handlers are around \u00a314,000 a year. Check-in and administration staff earn between \u00a311,000 and \u00a312,000. However, they take an average of 17 days' sick leave annually, compared to the national average of seven days per employee.</p> <p>Mr Gold said the idea of a lump sum was something the union would consider, but his members would not accept that money was being linked to sickness. He said the union was already discussing the problem of absenteeism separately with the company. </p> <p>BA's offer of the \u00a31000 bonus would be in addition to the 8.5% pay increase over three years already on the table. The company said that the unions' pay claim amounts to a 14.5% increase over three years, which is too expensive.</p>",

  "Companies will be able to sue for compensation over heavy-handed implementation of European business directives, under plans unveiled by the Conservative party today. <p>The Tories' proposals are aimed at Britain's habit of \"gold-plating\" EU regulations - going beyond the letter of the law and adding extra controls - which is \"undermining innovation and wealth creation,\" according to the opposition.</p> <p>Launching the plans today, the party's industry spokesman, Stephen O'Brien, conceded that they could be seen as a \"lawyers' charter\" but argued that the prohibitive cost of legal action would deter businesses from unnecessary challenges.</p> <p>He went onto to say that the Tories' eight-point plan would tackle the \"spring, flow and stock\" of such regulations. </p> <p>\"Good regulation can facilitate and boost markets,\" he said. \"Bad and excessive regulation, however, retards and distorts markets, undermining innovation and wealth creation.\" </p> <p>However, the trade secretary, Patricia Hewitt, said the plans would drive up costs for British business. </p> <p>\"Stephen O'Brien has failed to name a single European regulation the Tories would do away with,\" she said. \"Instead [he] advocated a course of action that would promote a culture of litigation which would significantly drive up costs for business. </p> <p>\"Today's Tory announcement on business regulation reeks of opportunism and simply doesn't make sense,\" she added. </p> <p>Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat trade spokesman, said: \"Whilst agreeing that legislation needs to be simpler and more direct, the Conservative proposals amount to a lawyers' charter. </p> <p>\"It will lead to an escalation of litigation, which will cost Britain even more money.\" </p> <p>The other key points of the Conservative plans are: <br><b>\u00b7</b> Minimum implementation of EU directives <br><b>\u00b7</b> Only backing legislation where benefits outweigh costs<br><b>\u00b7</b> Ensuring all member states comply before adopting new rules<br><b>\u00b7</b> Reviewing legislation before implementation<br><b>\u00b7</b> A red card system allowing 50% or more of member parliaments to veto new rules<br><b>\u00b7</b> Appointment of a deregulation commissioner</p>",
  "<p>Like every other entertainment sector, the videogame industry is prone to sudden fads and fashions that seem to spring out of nowhere, take the scene by storm, and then disappear only to be replaced by more advanced technologies, or better ideas, or something <em>really</em> silly.</p> <p>With this in mind, I've carefully surveyed the current industry and come up with ten concepts that no game design studio can afford to overlook. Feel free to add your own. Or take issue with mine.</p> <p><strong>1. Normal mapping</strong> This powerful graphics technique is all the rage at the moment \u2013 although only the Xbox and high-end PC graphics cards are really up to the job. A 'normal map' is like a holographic texture map that contains 3D information that is only revealed by the reflection of light on the surface. When you place a normal map onto a simple shape, the end result is an object that looks much more detailed than it actually is. Games like Doom 3, Far Cry and Chronicles of Riddick make impressive use of the technique.</p> <p><strong>2. Sandbox gameplay</strong> Sandbox is the new 'non-linear' - a favourite buzzword for open-ended game design. The analogy, of course, refers to a sandpit in a kids playground where you can do whatever you like (as long as it involves a bucket and spade presumably). The key example of sandbox gameplay is Grand Theft Auto, which provides complete freedom of exploration between the structured missions. Since the success of Vice City, everyone is trying open-ended gameplay. As a result, the dole office is full of unemployed end-of-level bosses.</p> <p><strong>3. Crime</strong> The biggest trend in gaming at the moment, mainly due to the success of GTA. We've had hired assassins (Hitman), cockney gangsters (The Getaway) snuff movie murder (Manhunt) and the Mafia (erm, Mafia), and we'll soon see robbery (Acclaim's <a href=\"http://www.acclaim.com/company/pressReleases/product/TheLastJob.html\">The Last Job</a>) and another LA gang thriller (25 To Life from Eidos). Boardrooms across the globe are right now trying to work out the next big crime concept. Unfortunately, all that's left are pick-pocketing, jay-walking and indecent exposure.</p> <p><strong>4. Street Racing</strong> All the big driving genres \u2013 arcade, rally, F1 \u2013 have been done to death, so developers, already fascinated by crime and edgy urban themes, have turned to street racing: the popular culture of taking your Mum's Citroen Saxo, sticking a massive spoiler on it and then annoying tax-payers by racing around the one way system at three in the morning. Several current games enable players to buy a piece of junk and then \"mod\" it so that it becomes\u2026 a piece of junk with lowered suspension and bucket seats. Most popular at the moment are Need for Speed Underground and Midnight Club 2 by Rockstar. New kids on the block include the very in-depth Juiced and Street Racing Syndicate from Namco.</p> <p><strong>5. Mass battles</strong> Once, shoot-em'-ups were about the lone crusader taking on swarms of enemies, the odds stacked against him like spent cartridges. Now, Battlefield 1942, State of Emergency and Call of Duty have popularised the concept of en masse team fighting. It's not just you anymore, it's you and a whole AI army willing to leg it directly into the line of fire while you cower at the back with a sniper rifle. As for multiplayer gaming, forget 16 player deathmatches, think 64 player team battles taking place over hundreds of acres of land. Men of Valor and Star Wars: Battlefront are the latest to sign up.</p> <p><strong>6. Physics</strong> The huge processing power of today's high spec PCs and games consoles means that developers are able to explore realistic physics in more depth and detail than ever before. Take racing games like Burnout 3, for example: each vehicle has dozens of deformation points where damage is shown on the chassis in the event of a crash. This damage is relative to the exact impact point and the force of impact. You also get actual chassis parts flying across the road \u2013 and of course, the trajectory of each piece is calculated in real-time.</p> <p>Another trendy concept is rag doll physics, an attempt to simulate the flexibility of human body movement, again in real-time. The most obvious use is in shooters like Splinter Cell 3. When an enemy is hit by a bullet, they stagger backwards, their arms flail and legs buckle, and the effect is localised depending on the exact point of impact. Bodies will also react to environments, rolling down stairs rather than lying awkwardly in mid-air. EA's boxing sim Fight Night 2004 also uses rag doll physics to create realistic reactions to punches.</p> <p>The most respected physics engine at the moment is published by US company <a href=\"http://www.havok.com\">Havok</a>. The website provides a <a href=\"http://www.havok.com/products/index.php\">handy guide</a> to current game physics if you want to learn more. Which I'm sure you do.</p> <p><strong>7. Bloom lighting</strong> Blooming is a technique that simulates the corona, or blur, that surrounds bright light sources like street lamps or polished metal. It's achieve by effectively taking a snapshot of all the lights in one frame of the videogame image, and then downsampling until the image loses much of its information, before laying the bloom image back over the original lighting. Got that? Doom3, Halo and Burnout all make noticeable use of the technique.</p> <p><strong>8. Dynamic soundtracks</strong> A musical soundtrack that actually reacts to the onscreen action, altering in intensity when the player comes into danger, rather than merely tinkling along in the background. Splinter Cell 3: Chaos Theory, Metroid Prime and even Ashen on the N-Gage employ this technique. It's slightly more imaginative then merely filling the disc with licensed songs \u2013 although that's very popular at the moment too (see much of EA's current output especially Burnout 3, and, of course, GTA Vice City).</p> <p><strong>9. Historical accuracy</strong> Once the preserve of sad PC strategy titles, history has become a major videogame theme. It is conceivable that a generation of gamers knows more about the Second World War from playing Battlefield 1942, than they ever learned at school. EA's first-person shooter takes in key flashpoints like Operation Market Garden and El Alamein, while PC shooter Brothers in Arms is based around a true story, following the initial days of the invasion of Normandy. Other titles such as Medal of Honor, Call of Duty and Codename: Panzers take in other major battles. The Vietnam War and Desert Storm have since come in for similar treatment.</p> <p><strong>10. Party gaming</strong> Since the launch of the PlayStation in 1994, Sony Computer Entertainment has been leading the charge to re-brand gaming as a legitimate element of youth culture alongside pop music, movies and getting pregnant. This process began with Wipeout, the 1995 futuristic racer loaded with licensed tunes by the likes of the Chemical Brothers. Later, the cute cartoon music title Pa Rappa the Rappa went further by attracting a genuinely unisex mainstream audience. Things are more sophisticated now with dancing games like Dance UK and Sony's EyeToy titles becoming party favourites among teenagers who might play no other form of videogame.</p> <p>Now SingStar and soon to be released hip-hop karaoke sim <a href=\"http://www.eidosinteractive.com/gss/legacy/getondamic/main.html\">Get On Da Mic</a>, encourage participants to sing as well as dance, projecting their images onto the TV screen. Toying ever-so-gently with our sick, celebrity-obsessed minds, these social games are going to become more and more important over the next few years as the industry courts a wider audience. Eventually, the strands of mainstream interactive entertainment will merge. Combine the EyeToy camera peripheral with a broadband connection and you have the biggest talent show imaginable. Or a million Big Brother shows happening online simultaneously. You can decide for yourself which is the most nightmarish.</p>",

  "The chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, today offered a rare admission that he had made mistakes, but his vague contrition angered Palestinian politicians who have been calling for reform and tougher anti-corruption measures. <p>In a televised speech to the Palestinian parliament, Mr Arafat acknowledged there was some official corruption in the authority he has led for the last decade. He said those engaged in wrongdoing should be prosecuted and reiterated that he would streamline the security forces. </p> <p>\"There were wrong practices in some institutions, and some misused their positions,\" he said. \"There were not enough efforts to strengthen the rule of law, the independence of the judicial institutions ... Be we have begun measures to solve this.\" </p> <p>However, Mr Arafat, who has been resisting intense pressure to halt official corruption, reform the security services and relinquish some of his near-absolute powers, did not outline what the mistakes had been or how he planned to correct them. </p> <p>One of his harshest critics, former cabinet minister Abdel Jawad Saleh, shouted that Mr Arafat himself was protecting corrupt officials. Mr Arafat responded angrily: \"I'm protecting them?\" </p> <p>Mr Saleh complained after the speech that Mr Arafat was \"not serious\" about reforms and warned that there could be a non-violent \"Palestinian uprising against this authority very soon\". </p> <p>Mr Arafat's speech came amid growing dissatisfaction in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with his rule. Last month, street protests erupted over some of his appointments, and Mr Arafat's prime minister, Ahmed Queria, briefly threatened to resign. </p> <p>However, even his harshest critics have not demanded that Mr Arafat resign, as he is still widely considered a national symbol. Nevertheless he has been clearly rattled by the outpouring of complaints. </p> <p>In response to them, Mr Arafat has promised sweeping government reform and met politicians who asked him to put his pledges in writing. However, Palestinian representatives came away disappointed, saying Mr Arafat had largely been evasive. </p> <p>Mr Arafat's speech today came as the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, prepared to face down rightwing critics within his own Likud party. At a conference this evening, the party will vote on a proposed coalition with the opposition Labour party. </p> <p>Many hardline Likud members, opposed to Mr Sharon's plan to evacuate all 21 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and four in the West Bank by late next year, are against a coalition deal as Labour would cement a cabinet majority in favour of the pullout. </p> <p>Mr Sharon lost his parliamentary majority over his \"unilateral disengagement\" plan because of objections from pro-settlement coalition partners. Likud members have already voted against the plan by a wide margin in a non-binding referendum, but Mr Sharon chose to ignore the results and pressed ahead with his plans. </p> <p>Analysts say if the convention votes against a coalition with Labour, Mr Sharon might have to call early elections. However, the vote, like the referendum, would not be legally binding. </p> <p>Labour backs Mr Sharon's plan, although it also favours a wider pullout from the West Bank and direct talks with the Palestinians. Some Labour MPs have expressed concerns that Mr Sharon, a longtime supporter of Jewish settlements, does not intend to implement his plan. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Sharon approved the construction of 1,000 new housing units in four large West Bank settlements, in violation of the US-backed \"roadmap\" peace plan for the region.</p>",

  "<p>Patients will be able to get prescription medicines over the internet, by mail order in 24-hour supermarkets and in out of town shopping centres after a relaxation of the rules controlling the location of pharmacies.</p> <p>The new rules, announced today by health minister Rosie Winterton, will prepare the ground for more widespread use of the internet to order medicines when electronic prescription services currently being piloted by the NHS are extended across the country.</p> <p>At the moment, the pilot schemes are running with two companies, Allcures and Pharmacy2u, but for most patients this still means putting their NHS prescription in the post so it can be verified by the firm before medicines are dispensed.</p> <p>The package of changes announced today is aimed at making it easier and quicker for new pharmacies offering NHS prescription services to open. But the government has stopped short of the full-scale deregulation to increase competition called for by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in a bid to protect smaller community pharmacists.</p> <p>The local community pharmacists are often the only source of prescription medicines for those living in rural areas or without easy access to transport. The OFT recommendations had provoked fears that many would be driven out of business by pharmacies in supermarkets and shopping centres.</p> <p>The government has laid down rules intended to balance the widening of access to pharmacy with safeguards to protect community pharmacists. They stipulate that internet and mail-order based pharmacies must provide a fully professional service, while supermarket-based pharmacies offering services for more than 100 hours a week must stick to their commitment to open for at least that long.</p> <p>Pharmacies can only be located in shopping centres that are outside town centres and cover more than 15,000 square metres. Pharmacies can be set up as part of new one-stop primary care centres, but only where they serve a \"substantial population\" of 18,000 to 20,000 patients and offer a wide range of services other than those provided by GPs, such as dentistry or optometry.</p> <p>Ms Winterton said: \"These reforms continue to support the government's aim to put the needs of patients first, ensuring that local health services reflect the changing lifestyles and needs of patients. We are maintaining the vital role played by community pharmacies, particularly in poorer and rural areas, many of whom are small businesses.</p> <p>\"We are determined to improve access to, and the choice of, pharmacy services and to encourage innovation and excellence so that community pharmacy is recognised as a key player in the provision of NHS services. These reforms will provide an environment in which community pharmacy services can thrive.\"</p> <p>Simon Williams, policy director at the Patients Association, said the new rules should encourage innovation and greater access to pharmacy care. But he added: \"I hope these proposals will complement and not threaten community pharmacies that have a relationship with their local community.\"</p> <p>Internet pharmacy services could improve access to medicines for people who could not physically get to a pharmacy, Mr Williams said, although he was concerned at the absence of professional advice and support that a community pharmacist could offer.</p> <p>Anne Galbraith, chairwoman of the government's advisory group on reforming pharmacy regulations, said: \"Government has obviously given the proposals and our advice very careful consideration. I am sure community pharmacy and the NHS will welcome that the way forward on control of entry has now been finally determined.\"</p>",
  "<p>Workers at Eurostar, the cross-channel train company, voted today to take industrial action in a dispute over pay, threatening strikes over the August bank holiday weekend.</p> <p>Members of the Rail Maritime and Transport union voted by 82 to 37 in favour of walkouts. The union will announce strike dates later this week, but warned of disruption over the August bank holiday weekend. </p> <p>Travellers over the Bank holiday weekend already face the possibility of severe disruption at Heathrow and other UK airports with a threatened strike by check-in staff at British Airways.</p> <p>The Eurostar dispute centres on a claim by the RMT that workers at the Ashford terminal in Kent earn \u00a34,000 a year less than staff at London's Waterloo station. The union said staff at Ashford were paid \u00a313,000 a year, unchanged from a decade ago. </p> <p>Eurostar said any strike would be \"pointless\" and insisted that services would not be affected. An official accused the union of \"stirring up trouble\" when it was not needed and pointed out that Eurostar had very high staff retention rates. The company describes itself as a \"model employer\".</p> <p>Only a small number of staff were affected by the dispute, Eurostar said. The RMT had asked around 150 of its members to vote on a strike over pay.</p> <p>Last month, Eurostar reported a 19% increase in passenger numbers after the opening of one of the first UK sections of the high-speed rail link.

  "<p>Anthony Dowell still remembers the day when Antony Tudor came to the Royal Ballet to watch the company class. It was 1967: Dowell was 23 and a very junior principal, the choreographer was 58 and creating his first work for the Royal after a 30-year exile in New York. As soon as Tudor walked into the room, says Dowell, he could feel the intimidating crackle of his presence. \"You always knew when he was watching you. He was like a hawk, with these incredibly piercing eyes.\" </p> <p>Shortly afterwards, Tudor offered Dowell the lead in his new ballet, Shadowplay. \"Nothing,\" says Dowell, \"prepared me for the experience. Tudor was completely unlike Ashton or MacMillan in the way he worked. There was something quite creepy about it; you never knew what was coming next.\" </p> <p>Tudor died in 1987, yet he is still regarded with a certain trepidation. He may be one of Britain's finest choreographers, but his work rarely appears on the UK stage. Although four of his ballets are being performed at the Edinburgh festival this year - three by Ballet West USA, and Dark Elegies by the Rambert Dance Company - it owes more to coincidence than any official celebration of this unsung talent. </p> <p>But Tudor was an outsider for much of his life. He was born William Cook in 1909; the son of an East End butcher, he left school in 1924 and became a clerk in Smithfield market. He had his sights on a more flamboyant destiny than the meat-packing business, however, and after studying ballet out of hours presented himself for training at Marie Rambert's studio. In the 1920s a vertiginous gulf still existed between working-class culture and the cosmopolitan ballet scene and as Tudor began to move between these alien worlds he learned to adopt different manners, different masks. </p> <p>Marie Rambert always claimed that Tudor had \"a devil inside him\" butting fiercely against his rigorous self-control. When he began choreographing for her company in the 1930s, that devil found expression in his dances. His 1936 ballet, Lilac Garden, portrayed an illicit affair in Edwardian Britain; at a time when most choreographers were still looking to folklore, myth or fashion plates for their material, Tudor showed how people's lives were being muted and deformed by a repressive society. </p> <p>He quickly became notorious as a control freak, choreographing every aspect of the dancers' performance down to the position of their little fingers and the angle of their heads. In doing so, he evolved a dark, understated body language that was capable of capturing the tiniest nuance of feeling. This attention to detail worked to harrowing effect in Dark Elegies, Tudor's 1937 setting of Mahler's Kindertotenlieder, in which a small community mourns its dead children. </p> <p>Mark Baldwin, current director of Rambert Dance Company, is reviving Dark Elegies for the company's Edinburgh programme and first danced in the work in the 1980s. He was coached by the veteran Rambert ballerina Sally Gilmour, who revealed how the ballet was built up out of very exact moments. \"She identified each phrase like a separate breath and made us see how precisely each image worked as a metaphor,\" he says. \"Mahler's score is enormous, but Tudor found something very still in it. The dance cuts through these huge gusts of sound in ways that seem simple but are really very expressive.\" </p> <p>Baldwin says that some of his colleagues regard Dark Elegies as \"literally the best ballet ever made\". But it was also one of the last he made for a British company before his exile. In 1939, as the second world war was breaking out, Tudor decided to accept an invitation to work with Ballet Theatre in New York. When the war was over he received no overtures from the British ballet world to return home. Many believe the hostility towards him originated from Ninette de Valois, director of the Royal Ballet, who apparently resented him for sitting out the war in safety. Whatever the truth, Tudor made the rest of his career in New York, and British audiences have been granted only intermittent views of the ballets he created there. </p> <p>One rare sighting came in 1995 when Birmingham Royal Ballet acquired Tudor's 1941 work Pillar of Fire. Its central character, Hagar, a lonely woman struggling to accept her own sexual devils, was danced by Marion Tait, who was coached in the role by ex-Tudor ballerina Sally Wilson. Like Gilmour, Wilson proved to have an astonishing memory for the detail of the choreography. But she had also been imbued with Tudor's rehearsal methods. </p> <p>Tudor didn't just have exacting ideas about what he wanted from his dancers, he was cruelly manipulative in the ways he extracted them. Perhaps because he harboured so many secrets of his own, he was wickedly astute in using other people's insecu rities as leverage. \"Thank God I never had to work with Tudor himself,\" says Tait. \"I would have been pulp in his hands.\" </p> <p>Tudor's spirit, though, lived on in Wilson. Tait, at the time a confident 45-year-old, says she was soon made aware that: \"Sally wanted me to suffer in rehearsals the way Tudor had made her suffer. He could be vile to his dancers and Sally was hard on me. By the end of rehearsals I felt completely wrung out. That's where the performance came from. I thought I was going to be terrible, and somehow the first night was amazing.\" </p> <p>Dowell confirms that working with Tudor was scary, although he feels that he got off lightly. \"There was one poor girl who he'd selected as his main victim and she took the brunt of all his needling. But he was constantly tweaking all of us. He seemed to have an intuitive sense of people's personalities and he used that to get at us.\" Dowell didn't believe it made the group better dancers. \"We all felt terrified that he was going to turn on us next.\" </p> <p>By the time Dowell worked with Tudor on Shadowplay, the choreographer was in his late 50s and had become even more unorthodox. He was a practising Buddhist and had conceived Shadowplay as an allegory of a young boy's spiritual awakening. Some of its significance, however, was completely lost on his cast. Dowell cites one early rehearsal when Tudor instructed him to \"look up into a tree\" and then demanded to know \"what kind of tree\" it was. Dowell, panicking, had no idea how to reply. He was further disconcerted when Tudor told him to shut his eyes and silently placed a mango in his hands. Dowell could not even identify the fruit he had been given. \"I'd never seen a mango before.\" </p> <p>Tudor seemed to Dowell \"like someone from another planet\". But if working with the choreographer was difficult, Dowell also feels that Tudor \"transformed my development as a dancer. He taught me to use my imagination, to think the story as I performed it.\" Baldwin and Tait have similarly intense memories. Perhaps after Edinburgh's revival more British dancers will get the chance to share their experience. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ballet West USA's Antony Tudor programme is at the Edinburgh Playhouse from August 27-30.

  "<p><strong>Q</strong> I am considering leaving my current job and going freelance as a PR consultant. I want a new bank account for my business venture but, as a sole trader, cannot see the benefit of a business account, with its heavy charges, over an ordinary current account. </p> <p>Apart from the added kudos of having an account in a business name, why shouldn't I just open a new personal account with free banking and cheque facilities? I'm not really in the market for a 'business advisor' or whatever else comes with small business banking - I just want to keep my business finances separate from my personal ones.</p> <p><strong>CT</strong> </p> <p><strong>A</strong> Any money generated by your intended business - whether earned or owed - needs to be identifiable at every stage of each transaction as well as easily identifiable as separate from your own personal cash. A business bank account is the simplest way to achieve this, and will allow government departments - including the Inland Revenue - creditors and auditors to accurately assess your business. </p> <p>On the other hand, as a sole trader, it is acceptable for you to have customers write their cheques to you personally and then for you to bank them in your personal account. </p> <p>However, that would mean there was no clear way to differentiate your personal finances from your business transactions, and that could present problems. I can't find any rules prohibiting you from opening another personal account and using that one purely for business, thus avoiding transaction charges and keeping your finances separate with one stroke. The Inland Revenue might see things differently, though, so you might want to check.</p> <p>If you do decide to go ahead with a business account, do some serious shopping around.

But, especially as a sole trader, you should be far more concerned with charges than with interest.</p> <p>One option for keeping costs down might be an online business account, which can generally offer either higher interest or lower charges due to its own lower overheads.

  "<p>I've been to Edinburgh every summer since 1996. This year, however, I packed my bags for Kilkenny, where what used to be a local arts week has transformed into an international festival that is becoming a viable alternative to its bigger, brasher Scottish counterpart. Last year, Kilkenny acquired a dynamic new director in the shape of Claudia Woolgar, who has tilted the festival towards eastern Europe. The Gypsy bands Turlitawa and Les Manouches were two of her proudest acquisitions. They come from very different nomadic traditions (one is Roma, one is Sinti) and roamed musically from India to Macedonia. </p> <p>Kilkenny is a compact, select affair, and pretty sleek when you compare it with other festivals. Where Edinburgh is frenetic, Kilkenny is laid back. There are no stand-up comics, no flyer-thrusting desperadoes, and it has not been swallowed up by its fringe. It does have a fringe, however, which is mainly run by local artists who have colonised every available nook and cranny to show their work. </p> <p>The absence of comedy left Woolgar with more space to programme visual arts, including American artist Pat Keck's cluster of wooden puppets. Unbalanced Ghost was a bloodless figure with a shock of bleached hair and a long Giacometti face, perched on a seesaw and outbalanced by a feather. Keck invites interactivity; by turning a lever, you could make the zombie-like figures shudder into life and play congo drums, and when you peeked behind the curtain at a lifesize puppet theatre, the marionettes were all being operated by other marionettes. L\u00faghaidh \u00d3 Braonain's Circle I and Scribe used the city itself as a canvas. The public were invited to graffiti a Kilkenny shop window. The artist would then inscribe the graffiti onto a pillar of acrylic and transport it out of town to an old mill where it would complete a circle of other graffiti-scrawled pillars. I saw the incomplete circle, lit up in the darkness of the mill's eaves, the pillars looking as peaceful as ancient standing stones despite the fretful, angry slogans they were covered in. Back in Kilkenny, I tripped over a bunch of late-night revellers stopping off to inscribe the window with messages of love and hate. </p> <p>The city was also central to The Performance Corporation's show Dr Ledbetter's Experiment, about a Victorian clergyman-scientist unhinged by reading too much Darwin. The audience met at a Tudor townhouse. We were given headphones, playing a soundtrack that at first threatened to mimic the worst kind of heritage audio tour, as it took us back in time. But then two Victorian figures burst in, all mutton-chops and corsets, and we were thrust into the drama, becoming, variously, the audience at a public execution, a congregation singing All Things Bright and Beautiful, schoolchildren being herded across the street and, finally, the victims of a gruesome scientific experiment, shivering in the darkness as a dungeon door clanged shut. </p> <p>When I went to see Chamber Made - Room 409, a dance piece by CoisC\u00e9im Dance Theatre, which is set at the Kilkenny Ormonde Hotel, three of the 15-strong audience (full capacity, as the show is crammed into one small hotel room) were hotel staff. The piece, choreographed by David Bolger and Katie Read, starts in the hotel lobby. The audience went up in a lift, then along a corridor, where a befuddled-looking man in white walked past carrying a battered suitcase. The hotel staff, walking in behind me, stopped to check that he knew where he was going, and had to be ushered into the hotel room so that the show could start. They gasped when the man entered after them - as a performer. </p> <p>The biggest event of the festival was on the opening weekend, with a classical fireworks concert (few and far between in Kilkenny, as fireworks cannot be bought in the Republic of Ireland but have to be imported, under strict regulations), and a one-day music festival in the sunken gardens of a ruined, ivy-strangled stately home called Woodstock. Alongside big-name bands such as the Hot House Flowers, Mundy, and Jerry Fish and the Mudbug Club, were unknown local performers, who got the chance to play to an audience of 10,000. </p> <p>There was one conspicuous gap in the programme; anyone expecting to see a lot of Yeats, Synge and Wilde, or even the newer generation of Irish playwrights, such as Martin McDonagh and Conor McPherson, would have been disappointed.</p>",
  "Downing Street dug its heels in last night against mounting criticism within the Labour ranks of suggestions that Ayad Allawi, the interim head of the Iraqi government, should be invited to address the party conference in Brighton next month. <p>As leftwing MPs and activists expressed varying degrees of surprise, senior Labour officials were still in the dark 48 hours after the proposal emerged in weekend news reports. But it was later confirmed that an invitation to Mr Allawi, whose career has aroused deep controversy, is still on the cards. </p> <p>\"This is something that has been mentioned by people as something that has been thought about,\" a senior official at No 10 said. </p> <p>\"It is not possible to state whether a invitation has been sent or not, or the strength of the proposition.\" </p> <p>That remark reinforced the suspicion that Tony Blair himself - currently a guest of another controversial ally, the Italian prime minster, Silvio Berlusconi - is the driving force behind the attempt to sell the new regime in Baghdad face-to-face at Labour's annual conference. </p> <p>The prospect has prompted Labour CND to urge delegates to demonstrate in Brighton, and at least one member of the party's ruling national executive committee, Mark Seddon, to predict there will be a walkout if Mr Allawi speaks. </p> <p>Some ministers outside the Iraqi policy loop are cautiously prepared to defend the idea, frustrated that the views of Iraqi reformers - trade unionists and communists among them - rarely get a hearing among what one called \"Blair-hating\" media commentators. </p> <p>\"It's been driving a lot of us crazy these last few months that whenever we hear Iraqis speaking effectively for what's happening it never gets picked up in the British press,\" one minister said last night. </p> <p>Another said: \"We need someone to offer a vision for the future of Iraq rather than the daily horrors of the conflict and security issues.\" </p> <p>But the leftwing MP and veteran critic of Saddam Hussein's regime, Jeremy Corbyn, wrote to Mr Blair urging him not to invite a leader who \"has not been elected by anyone, but merely appointed from a group of people selected by Britain and the US\". </p> <p>In fact Mr Allawi emerged as a compromise candidate last May, as a secular former exile to Britain who has been commended for being \"equally mistrusted by everyone\". </p> <p>Since 1997 Labour has had a series of high-profile guest speakers, including Nelson Mandela and Bill Clinton, as well as Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's interim leader. </p> <p>Since taking office on July 1 Mr Allawi has played the hard man on security issues - and even threatened martial law. More seriously, he has been accused of personally executing six insurgents held at the Amariya detention centre outside Baghdad this summer - a charge which is denied but which has been widely disseminated.</p>",
  "<p>If only it was that simple - single out children of criminals, give them some support and they'll stop offending. There are numerous factors that increase the risk of children turning to crime and family members involved in the criminal justice system is only one of these risk factors. However, the government has conveniently narrowed the risk of offending down to the family, and specifically, the role of parents. The other risk factors receive little attention and these include truancy/problems at school, drug abuse, lack of facilities, homelessness, unemployment, low income and economic recession. Recent research into young offenders reveals a background of disadvantage, neglect and deprivation. Unproductive school careers, poverty and unemployment can also have an impact on their lives. </p> <p>This latest proposal for children of offenders to be \"targeted\" and \"tracked\" from an early age will make little impact on preventing them from turning to crime. In fact it will result in stigmatising and labelling children of offenders and could increase their likelihood of breaking the law. This is because society will be saying that this is expected of them. Pinpointing a child as being from a 'criminal' family will also have an impact on how professionals and others see that child and how they respond to them. Without doubt their expectations and belief in the child could be altered. Surely we should always be expecting the best of all of our children. NCH believes that all children should be encouraged to reach their full potential and this proposal could prevent that happening. If all we expect from these children is that they could become criminals then aren't we setting them up to become just that? </p> <p>NCH supports the idea of early intervention to help children considered to be at risk of offending or other difficulties. But we strongly believe that this should only happen if help is offered in a non-stigmatising way. This is obviously more likely if the offer of help does not come from the criminal justice system itself. The gulf between how we treat children who offend and how we treat children 'in need' has to be bridged and we should recognise that these children are often one and the same. We need to be investing in preventive community services for all vulnerable children, rather than separating out 'criminal' children from everyone else. What is important is to stop offending, not to label children as criminal. More focus is needed on diversion from the criminal justice system and on working with children and their families in a more productive way.</p> <p>It is an illusion to think there is a fool-proof way of identifying \"young offenders in the making\" at an early age. This proposal is based on the belief that a parent's criminality will be the key factor in determining their future behaviour. It is not that simple. The reasons children turn to crime are complex and multi-faceted. NCH is calling on this government to pay as much attention to the underlying structural factors that can lead to crime - poverty, deprived neighbourhoods, unemployment - as they do to the impact of parenting on crime.

  "Welcome to the Backbencher, Guardian Unlimited's weekly insider's guide to politics. <p><b>FROM AN EMPTY WESTMINSTER</b></p> <p>The Guardian's political editor Michael White looks at the implications of a poll suggesting that the NHS - not Iraq - is still the number one issue for voters.</p> <p>\"I'm sitting in a very quiet mid-August Westminster mulling over this morning's Guardian/ICM poll. It's a salutary reminder to politicians who are very concerned about Iraq that voters tend not to share their view.</p> <p>\"In fact, it was tenth out of 10 in the priorities of 1,005 voters questioned on the phone last weekend. It's worth stressing that Labour voters and Conservative voters are equally unmoved by the subject, though Lib Dems rank it seventh. </p> <p>\"The number one issue for all of them - no prizes for guessing - is the NHS, rated first by 59% of all voters. Everyone except the Conservative supporters put education second (the Tories choose 'tax and spend') and, interestingly, everyone puts 'law and order' third.</p> <p>\"So just a reminder that Iraq doesn't loom as large in the minds of most voters as it does, perhaps, to Labour-supporting broadsheet readers. But even that has to be qualified, because the poll says 12% of voters say Iraq is a 'crucial' issue for them in deciding who to support at the next election. Well, you may say 12% isn't a lot, but it could certainly make a big difference in an election. Those people who do care about Iraq certainly care a great deal.</p> <p>\"The EU and its proposed constitution, which is another issue looming large for all political leaders across the Union, is not rated so highly among ordinary voters as it is among party activists - particularly Tory ones. Another reminder that voters are often more interested in domestic bread-and-butter issues than those that get the political class excited.</p> <p>\"One wider point arising from the Guardian poll is that the Tories are up three points at 33%. They've been flatlining at around 30% for months now: Michael Howard has been impressing people at Westminster because he's a highly professional and intelligent leader but he hasn't really made a breakthrough with the voters. I think people probably feel he's a credible leader of the Tories and a man who could run the country but they are not particularly attracted to what the party is saying - although the Tories are working very hard this month. They have a policy coming out pretty much every day. Yesterday it was better use of bus lanes, today it's allowing companies to sue the government over excessive EU red tape.</p> <p>\"So the Tories have been busy, and they have a three-point gain to show for it. They seem to have scored them off the Lib Dems and the minor parties who have inevitably faded from view since the European and local elections in June. The main casualty was Ukip, whose share fell from 4% in the June Guardian/ICM poll to less than 1% this month. Ukip, let's not forget, eclipsed the BNP as a rightwing alternative vote for Tories who are a bit despairing of the official opposition at the moment. </p> <p>\"The Lib Dems are down a little on 22%, but Charles Kennedy will be pleased with that as its much higher than his party was polling at a comparable point in the last parliament and it's a pretty good base for a third party to go into an election. Mr Kennedy is hoping to benefit considerably from those Labour voters who do believe Iraq is the touchstone issue. Lots to play for. We'll have to see what the conference season brings.\"</p> <p><b> MIND YOUR OWN BLUNKETT</b></p> <p>Now, if any readers were under the impression that the Backbencher might seek to make any capital out of the home secretary's alleged [words omitted], they would be quite wrong. As yesterday's excellent Guardian editorial <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/leaders/story/0,,1284407,00.html\">points out</a>, the Sun's interest in Mr Blunkett's private life is voyeuristic, none of our business and has no bearing on his ability to do his job. Indeed, for all the criticisms of the home secretary's approach to privacy - of which more below - it's worth noting that he legislated against voyeurism in a bill too racy to be mentioned by name here. ID cards? Bring 'em on. Peeping through keyholes? Go straight to jail. And with that, the Backbencher is moving on.</p> <p><b> LAST FORTNIGHT'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>Unfortunately, however, the theme of her last competition drags her - much against her will - back to Mr Blunkett and privacy. She had asked readers to identify the three freedoms the home secretary believes the introduction of ID cards will help to protect.</p> <p>Some readers are clearly unfamiliar with the New Labour approach to public services. \"Employment, free health service, claim benefits,\" wrote a Nottingham University student. Carl, it's a touching suggestion, but you may find the months after graduation are tougher than you thought. \"I like the idea of people scanning my eyes, though,\" he added, a remark that caused the Backbencher to whimper aloud. She also received an entry from a precocious Minneapolis high school student. \"I am writing a paper on the 1945 general election and subsequent Labour government for my IB extended essay,\" writes Evan, who claims to be able to \"distinguish Nye Bevan from Ernest Bevin\". The book's in the post, young man, and the Backbencher will see you on your Fulbright.</p> <p>The other winner is Mark Pryce, who sent a delightful email from the Hague pointing out that the Dutch presidency of the EU, backed by Britain, is about to table legislation obliging telephone and internet ISPs to store their traffic records.</p> <p>And those freedoms Mr Blunkett prizes? \"The freedom to live without being exploited, to prove quickly and decisively who we are, and to travel freely.\" You can run, citizens. But you can't hide.</p> <p><b> THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>One of the Backbencher's colleagues has kindly passed on a US president's first work of fiction for her to give away. No, it's not Bill's memoirs - she wouldn't make a cheap gag like that. It's Jimmy Carter's magnificent Civil War novel, The Hornet's Nest, published by <a href=\"http://www.simonsays.co.uk\">Simon and Schuster</a>.</p> <p>Of course, there's an element of fighting, tragedy and smallpox, but the Nobel Peace prizewinner can still do romantic: \"She was surprised by his passion, and thankful that she could help relieve his torment...\" To win it, just tell the Backbencher what John Prescott has been up to today (Wednesday).

  "<p>Having reached unprecedented levels of stardom with his performance in The Lord of the Rings, Sir Ian McKellen looks set to bounce even higher in his next film role - and this time he'll be travelling on springs.

With its release on video in the late 80s, the surreal show found a new following among British students. </p> <p>McKellen is a late addition to a high-profile cast. Backed by Pathe, The Magic Roundabout Movie will also feature the voices of Jim Broadbent (as Brian the Snail) and Joanna Lumley (Ermintrude the cow). Rather less hearteningly, Robbie Williams is on hand to provide the voice of Dougal the dog, while Kylie Minogue will take the nominal starring role of Florence, the little girl who plays peace-maker between the characters.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday Microsoft announced that it was hooking up with the <a href=\"http://www.icra.org/\">Internet Content Ratings Association</a> to provide a <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/frontpage/downloads/addin/searchdetail.asp?a=584\">FrontPage extension</a> which helps people building a website include an ICRA rating.

  "The average voter does not share the keen interest of the political and media classes with Iraq, according to the results of this month's Guardian/ ICM opinion poll. <p>The survey shows that voters, including Labour supporters, rank Iraq last out of a list of 10 issues that they consider to be most important when deciding how they will cast their vote in the next general election. Only 12% say it is a crucial issue for them in deciding who to support. </p> <p>Equally, the voters do not appear to share Westminster's preoccupation with the European Union and rank it only eighth out of 10.</p> <p>Conservative voters do regard the future of the EU as a more important question to them than Labour voters, but it does not dominate their thinking about politics and they still rank it only sixth in their list of concerns. </p> <p>The finding may give a jolt to those senior figures in the Tory party who regard a major crusade over changes to the EU constitution as the issue on which they can make the most progress at the next election. </p> <p>Instead, the average voter overwhelmingly regards the state of the health service as the most influential factor in his or her decision, followed by education and law and order.</p> <p>The polling evidence that Iraq fails to excite the voters may explain why Labour's poll position has remained buoyant over the past year despite the sharply divisive disputes within the cabinet and party over conduct of the war. </p> <p>This month's figures on voting intentions continue that trend, with Labour - on 36% - recovering from the hammering it took in the June European elections, but its overall lead reduced from five points to three points as the Tories enjoy a slightly better month.</p> <p>The August poll show the Conservatives up three points to 33%, mainly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats and the minor parties who have faded from public view after the European elections and subsequent byelections.</p> <p>The share of the vote for the \"other parties\" has fallen from 13% in June to 9% this month, with Ukip the biggest casualties. Its share of the vote is down from 4% in the June Guardian/ICM poll to less than 1% this month.</p> <p>When voters are asked what they consider to be the most important issues when deciding their party preference, their answers reveal an interesting profile of concerns. They were asked by ICM to name \"two or three\" that they considered the most important, so the percentages add up to far more than 100.</p> <p>For all voters the health service - at 59% - dominates their concerns followed some way behind by education, on 42%, and then law and order on 35%.</p> <p>The indication is that if the parties want to motivate people to vote in the next election they should concentrate on talking about public services and crime.</p> <p>The traditional issues of the economy and government taxation and spending policies come next in their concerns, followed by the issue of asylum seekers, named by 20% of all voters. </p> <p>Labour voters appear to be more interested in jobs than Tories or Liberal Democrats and they rank asylum, the EU and Iraq as the least important of their concerns.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat voters rank the EU higher than other voters, but other polling data shows that this does not necessarily mean they share the party's pro-European outlook.

  "The ex-Libertines singer Pete Doherty has been warned he could face jail after he admitted possessing a flick knife. <p>Doherty, 25, was found with the weapon by police who pulled him over as he drove to his home in Stepney, east London, in the early hours of June 18, Thames magistrates heard yesterday. </p> <p>He had previously said he wanted a jury trial on the charge of possessing an offensive weapon but pleaded guilty yesterday. He was accompanied to the court by a group of friends and family. </p> <p>Taiwo Adesina, for the prosecution, told the court the knife had been found in Doherty's jeans pocket. </p> <p>She said: \"At interview he stated he had it in his possession for a friend and he forgot it was in his pocket.\" </p> <p>Frank Brazell, defending, told the court the singer had returned from holiday 12 hours previously and the knife had been bought legally as a present for a friend. </p> <p>He said there was no suggestion the knife was ever going to be used as a weapon and it was a \"foolish, if you like almost romantic, mistake\" to plan to give it as a gift. </p> <p>He said Doherty had broken off the tip of the knife so it was not as sharp: \"He did not brandish the knife in any way, shape or form and did not threaten to do so. </p> <p>\"He is not someone with a history of violence. Those who know him well say he is quite the opposite, a peaceful man who pretty much abhors violence. He displayed nothing but cooperation with the police at the roadside or at the station.\" </p> <p>Penny Sinclair, the magistrate, ordered a pre-sentence report to be prepared and for him to attend court again for sentencing on September 1. </p> <p>She said: \"This court is not prepared to tie the hands of the next bench.

  "<p>GlaxoSmithKline's diabetes drug Avandia is facing generic competition in China as the company backs out of a court battle to protect its hold on the drug in the country. </p> <p>The industry is furious about a recent overturning of Pfizer's Viagra patent in the country, in a dispute that threatens the image of China as a potential powerhouse of the industry. Pfizer has been lobbying the US and Chinese governments to do more to protect patents in the country, a spokesman said. It is appealing the decision. </p> <p>Today there had been a court hearing expected in China, over one of Avandia's patents but Glaxo has quit the action. </p> <p>The British firm holds the basic patent, but Chinese generic drugs firms have challenged patents for different doses and versions of the drug, known as \"salts\", and Glaxo is understood to have decided its chances of winning are minimal. The issue is now in the hands of China's regulators. </p> <p>Last year Glaxo sold \u00a3931m worth of the drug, mainly in the United States, and the lack of sales in China would not significantly dent its growth. </p> <p>But there are parallels with a Chinese court's overturning of the Viagra patent last month, which infuriated Pfizer and jangled industry nerves. </p> <p>Patent protection of Aids treatments drew criticism because it hit poor countries hardest, but for drugs like Viagra there are fewer moral arguments for revoking a patent. </p> <p>Drug companies spend hundreds of millions of pounds developing drugs. They argue they need to charge much more than their manufacturing costs to recoup that, and any country that does not comply may be shunned by drugs firms. </p> <p>China's enormous population is expected to spend more on drugs as the country gets richer, and manufacturing and developing treatments there offers potential savings. Any weakening of patent law would add to the existing problem in the country of widespread counterfeiting. </p> <p>\"It would make us think twice about bringing innovative products to the marketplace,\" said Dr Eric Noehrenberg, director of international trade and market policy at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations. \"It is a disturbing trend.\" </p> <p>Pfizer threatened that it would not launch medicines in China if the patent protection is not adequate, but Glaxo said the Avandia issue would not affect its long-term plans for the country.</p>",
  "<p>Brian Moser's rarely shown photographs of Che Guevara were taken in Vallegrande, Bolivia, on October 9 1967, some six hours after the execution of the Cuban-Argentinian guerrilla leader. In their raw intensity they are more extraordinary than the famous shots taken by other photographers who flew in to Vallegrande the following day, after Guevara's body had been cleaned up overnight to look more respectable. Moser's earlier pictures are more dramatic, reflecting the immediacy of death and defeat, and the tense atmosphere surrounding the laundry hut where Guevara's body had been laid out. </p> <p>The Bolivian authorities were worried that their claim that this was indeed Guevara might not be believed, since one dead guerrilla, thin and emaciated and with matted hair and beard, looked much like another, and a procession of such corpses had been unloaded in Vallegrande in the previous weeks. So his hair and beard were clipped, and his dirty zippered jacket and shoes were removed. </p> <p>Put on show the next day, no one could doubt that this was Guevara, yet at the same time, the authorities laid bare the bullet hole on his upper body. He had been executed and now in death resembled the famous foreshortened painting by Mantegna of the death of Christ. That second-day photograph, with its iconic references attached, went round the world, helping to create the myth that has survived to this day. </p> <p>Earlier that year, I had told Guardian readers from my base in Santiago, Chile, that Guevara was probably operating in neighbouring Bolivia. In August, I travelled the length and breadth of the country to assess the strength of his guerrilla band and to investigate whether Bolivia was about to become the \"second Vietnam\" of which he dreamed. I drove from the tin mines in the freezing mountains of the Altiplano to the tropical cattle lands along the Brazilian border, but the message from the US ambassador in La Paz was absolutely clear: whatever happened there would be no US military intervention. </p> <p>Reading my Guardian articles in Manchester that summer, Moser, who worked for Granada Television, decided that Bolivia would make an excellent topic for a World in Action film, and called me in Chile to ask if I would join him as a researcher. We travelled up to Bolivia from Santiago in mid-September and began to set up the film. We visited the tin mines, by now under tight military control; the oil town of Camiri, where Guevara's French contact, R\u00e9gis Debray, was in prison; the sugar mill outside Santa Cruz where a dozen US marines, under the command of Major Robert \"Pappy\" Shelton, were training a new anti-guerrilla unit; and Vallegrande, a small colonial town in the foothills of the Andes that was the centre of the counter-guerrilla operations. We were told that Guevara's men were surrounded and would soon be captured, and I wrote a story for the Guardian to that effect. Moser cabled Manchester to request a film crew, though it arrived too late to record Guevara's final day. </p> <p>In the early evening of Sunday October 8, we were approached by a US Marine in the central square of Santa Cruz. \"Guevara has been captured,\" he said. He had heard the news on his military radio. Moser hired a Jeep and, joined by the Reuters correspondent, Christopher Roper, we drove through the night to Vallegrande, some 200km distant. We arrived early in the morning, but were allowed to travel no further. Guevara was being held some miles away at La Higuera, a remote village to which no access was permitted. Soon after midday, the entire high command of the Bolivian army arrived in a military plane from La Paz. General Alfredo Ovando, the commander-in-chief, held an impromptu press conference in a narrow street. \"Che Guevara is dead\", he announced, providing no further details. </p> <p>At five in the evening, a military helicopter landed at the town's small airfield, with Guevara's body tied to a stretcher on its landing rail. The stretcher was loaded on to a van and taken to the grounds of the town's hospital, where it was laid out on the flat basins of a laundry hut. It was an extraordinary scene, with peasants, townspeople, nuns and doctors from the hospital, and soldiers standing guard, everyone pushing and peering and trying to get a better view. I found a perch at the bottom end of the hut, holding on to a pillar, and gazed down at Guevara's feet, shod in faded green socks and rough moccasins. I watched while two doctors tried to put a tube into his neck in an attempt to preserve the body with formaldehyde. Had he not been wearing a jacket we might have seen the tell-tale sign of a bullet hole close to his heart. He had been shot at La Higuera some six hours earlier, but we had no way of knowing that at the time. </p> <p>I was the only person present who had seen Guevara alive and could vouch that this was he. I had met him in Havana some four years earlier. Actually, there was someone else there with Cuban connections, but he did not reveal his true identity. </p> <p>In my report for the Guardian, I described the activities of a US intelligence officer who sought to control this very public event, poking his head into the photographs and seeking to keep the peasants from entering the hut. Known to us as Eduardo Gonz\u00e1lez, he was a Cuban American working for the CIA. His real name was Gustavo Villoldo, and he lives to this day in Miami. </p> <p>Moser flitted about with his still camera, lamenting the fact that he only had half a roll of film left and that the Granada film crew had not arrived, but he secured some remarkable pictures all the same. </p> <p>Saddened by the spectacle, and bereft of any kind of communication with the outide world, we found our Jeep and drove back through the night to Santa Cruz. Not until the next day were we able to write down what we had witnessed and communicate the news to the outside world. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Richard Gott's latest book, Cuba: A New History, will be published next month by Yale University Press.</p>",

  "A former head of MI5 has condemned the detention of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, where British security service officials are said to have repeatedly interrogated suspects under harsh conditions. <p>Dame Stella Rimington's comments came just two weeks after Britons formerly held at the camp described how MI5 officers questioned them at length. </p> <p>Their lawyers accuse the UK of \"complicity\" in the detention and mistreatment of prisoners by the US at its Cuban base. </p> <p>\"It cannot be right to keep people in complete isolation, denied human contact and denied any access to the courts for an interminable length of time,\" she said yesterday at the Edinburgh Book Festival, where she was promoting her novel. </p> <p>\"I find that very difficult to come to terms with really.\" </p> <p>More than 600 men have been held at the camp for up to 30 months without charge or trial. </p> <p>Human rights groups are concerned about the conditions and ex-detainees say they were regularly beaten, shack led in painful positions, denied medication, and kept in cages infested with rats, snakes and scorpions. </p> <p>A report compiled from interviews with three men from Tipton who were released from the base in March this year, concluded: \"It was very clear to all three that MI5 was content to benefit from the effect of the isolation, sleep deprivation and other forms of acutely painful and degrading treatment, including short shackling.\" </p> <p>The men expressed considerable anger that \"there was never any suggestion on the part of the British interrogators that this treatment was wrong\". </p> <p>Sadiq Khan, whose law firm represents some of the four Britons and three or more British residents still detained at the base, welcomed her comments, saying: \"It's clear that security service officials have gone over and questioned people. </p> <p>\"If the person who previously headed MI5 expresses such concern, one can only hope her successors will listen and heed what she is saying.\" </p> <p>The Home Office said: \"As a former head, she is quite entitled to have her opinions.\"</p>",
  "<p>After lunch, Amy Littleford watched a grey mist descend on Boscastle from her chair beside the living room window. As the sky turned darker and darker, the 86-year-old got up and checked her front door. She found a waterfall flowing down the steps. </p> <p>Like several hundred other people trapped in their homes, Mrs Littleford, who has a pacemaker, would have been swamped if she had opened her door. </p> <p>So she grabbed a wooden broom and started frantically trying to protect herself and her property from the turbulent brown water racing down the Cornish hillside. </p> <p>\"It was teeming,\" she said. \"I went to the front door and it was like a fountain coming off the steps.\" </p> <p>The first hint that something was going seriously wrong in Boscastle came just before 2pm, when the cast iron manhole covers in the street began to gently twitch from the force of the water underneath. </p> <p>It had been raining for more than an hour; but it was not the normal mid-summer storm that regularly sends tourists, clutching their pasties and ice creams, scurrying for cover in this part of the north Cornish coast.</p> <p>Instead it was rain of a biblical intensity, cascading off roofs and bouncing high off the pavements so that umbrellas offered little protection. </p> <p>Mrs Littleford swept for more than an hour as her granddaughter, Mia Giudetti, desperately tried to get back to the house to help her. Ms Giudetti had been enjoying the sunshine 16 miles away in Launceston when she heard about the storm hitting Boscastle. </p> <p>Boscastle stands in a deep coomb where two valleys meet, formed by the rivers Valency and Jordan, while a third river, Paradise, also flows through the village. Some rivers react sluggishly to sudden downpours, while others, especially those with a short catchment area, are known as \"spaty\". Unfortunately for Boscastle, the Valency very much belongs in the latter category. </p> <p>Where the Valency meets the Jordan by the harbour, Di Johnson was working in the Rocky Road art gallery, selling African art and jewellery, when the sky turned black. \"We didn't really notice it at first because it had been raining for a while,\" she said. \"We shut the door of the shop trying to stop the water getting in, thinking it was a small flood. Then we just watched the water go higher and higher against the glass. </p> <p><strong>Human chain</strong><br> </p> <p>\"Everyone started to scream, because it was black outside and the electricity had gone down. The flood water was rising so quickly we realised we had to get out. We put a board across the door to stop the water coming in and we climbed over it and formed a human chain to get out of the water and over to the other side.\" </p> <p>As emergency calls began to come in, the first rescue helicopter, from RAF Chivenor in north Devon, was scrambled at 4.10pm. Within five minutes Flight Lieutenant John Evans and his crew were on their way to the scene. \"When we arrived there was lightning and heavy rain which made the rescue bid very hazardous,\" he said. </p> <p>The winchman, Sergeant Mario Testa, was sent down to rescue a woman with a broken thumb who was trapped in her house in the main street. </p> <p>\"Suddenly we got an urgent call from the coastguard telling us to go to a house down the road to rescue a man having a heart attack. Because it was so noisy with the rotor blades going and the rain pelting down, the only way to get Mario's attention was to fire a distress flare into the water,\" Flt Lt Evans said. </p> <p>\"He had to leave the woman where she was and we winched him up to get to the heart attack victim. The other casualty was only 20 metres [65ft] down the road but it took a good five minutes to negotiate the helicopter to the position.\" </p> <p>The fire service began fielding a flood of calls. \"It was absolute bedlam when it started to kick off last night,\" said Matt Littmoden, the deputy the chief fire officer of Cornwall fire brigade. \"We had 170 calls from Boscastle and we had toprioritise them.\" </p> <p>Dispatching the first of 17 engines to the scene, the firefighters focused on saving old people and children first as windows imploded with the water pressure. \"People whose homes were flooded went to the bottom of the list,\" said Mr Littmoden. But the emergency effort was hampered by village geography. Phone lines and mobile masts were down and even emergency service radios did not work at the bottom of the steep valley. </p> <p>Ron Muffett was in his restaurant, the Old Manor House, by the harbour when a friend pointed out that the river was inches from the top of its bank. </p> <p>He watched as a tree fell on the wooden footbridge and cars and other debris were hurled into the collapsed bridge, creating a dam and forcing the river back and over its banks. Minutes before the floodwaters engulfed his restaurant, Mr Muffett left to check his pub further up the hill. Then, with phone lines down, he could not call or get back to the 250-year-old property to check that his wife and daughter were OK. </p> <p><strong>Unbelievable</strong><br> </p> <p>\"I drove out with two minutes to spare,\" he said. \"It was so quick, it was unbelievable. I tried to get back down there and I couldn't.\" </p> <p>Homes and up-market gift shops near the harbour were swiftly inundated with floodwater, laying waste to carpets and furniture and ruining shop stock. </p> <p>George Findlay, 64, a local handyman, could only watch after running down to the harbour to help. \"There was 10ft of water by the main road bridge. Then it became blocked by cars that got jammed under it. The river was going past at 40mph. There were vans and motor homes going down it. You can't imagine it. </p> <p>\"Then I saw the Clovelly Clothing shop move 20ft and just collapse. The water was going in the back of the Wellington Hotel and coming through the front windows one storey up. Beer barrels were coming out on the water like corks.\" </p> <p>By 5.15pm the situation was becoming desperate, and one of the rescue pilots radioed the Aeronautical Rescue Co-ordination Centre at RAF Kinloss: \"Pass to all emergency services. This is a major, repeat major, incident. We require all the standby aircraft available. We are in danger of losing the people in the houses in Boscastle at the moment.\" </p> <p>Mr Muffet's wife and daughter were pulled out of the Old Manor House by fire fighters as the community came out in force to help. \"We went and opened the village hall,\" said Mr Findlay. \"People were wet and soaked and there was no electricity but we found some gas burners and got cups of tea, dry towels, and some of the women made sandwiches.\" </p> <p>By evening, there were 100 locals and holidaymakers huddled in the hall before the emergency services opened up the sports hall in nearby Camelford. </p> <p>Disbelief was a dominant emotion in the village yesterday, but as John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, visited the scene and promised his full support, villagers were already making plans for the reconstruction of their community. </p> <p>\"We've got friends who have lost everything,\" said one villager. \"To see it totally destroyed is devastating. We can't believe it has happened. The good thing is the National Trust own the harbour so they will restore things properly but that won't replace what we have lost.\" </p> <p>Local people have also set up a disaster fund. As the telephone networks return to life, they are already fielding dozens of calls from friends, neighbours and holidaymakers who have enjoyed the good times in Boscastle and have pledged support to help see it through the bad. </p> <p>It took Ms Giudetti five hours to reach her home to discover her grandmother had saved the house from flooding. </p> <p>As the sky turned dark with the promise of further storms yesterday, Mrs Littleford said: \"After the rain I looked up and said 'Thank you, Lord, for looking after us' and it hasn't rained again.\"</p>",
  "<p>British manufacturing's recovery is being hit by rising prices in commodities ranging from oil to steel scrap. Crude prices set new record levels yesterday, pushing up energy prices, while the price of many steel products is at least 50% higher than a year ago - and could rise further. </p> <p>Yesterday Brian Cooke, the chief executive of West Midlands-based company Castings, described the situation as the worst in 40 years. \"I have not seen such rapid increases in costs in 40-odd years in the industry. This is something new and outside our control.\"</p> <p>Martin Temple, the director-general of the EEF, which represents many of the UK's manufacturing firms, said that with commodity prices from scrap to energy rising, \"it is inevitable that there are some massive price pressures\".</p> <p>Latest official figures show that manufacturing input prices rose by 3.4% in the year to July, while output prices were up 2.5%, implying that companies were seeing margins under pressure.</p> <p>The price squeeze could intensify. Ian Rodgers, the director of trade organisation UK Steel, said that while prices had reached a plateau during the summer, \"it looks as if prices will start to pick up again in the post-holiday period\".</p> <p>Surging steel production in China has been the key factor, sending the price of raw materials for making steel, such as iron ore, scrap and coke, soaring.</p> <p>Mr Rodgers believes China remains the \"joker in the pack\" in respect of global demand for raw materials and steel.</p> <p>\"There is still a very tight supply situation as far as the world steel market is concerned,\" he said.</p> <p>Although power shortages over the summer had slowed Chinese steel production, \"the market for steel has started growing again\".</p> <p>Oil prices are at all-time highs in nominal terms, despite falls earlier in the week on the back of the Venezuelan referendum result, which eased fears of possible disruption of supplies from the world's fifth largest producer.</p> <p>The latest rise came yesterday as US consumer price figures suggested demand would remain strong. In New York oil settled at $46.72 a barrel after peaking at a new high of $46.95.</p> <p>The future of energy prices is a growing concern within UK manufacturing - and not simply because of the current oil price. Mr Temple cites issues such as emission trading, climate change laws and the price of gas as additional factors likely to affect the price of electricity, energy's bottom line for manufacturers, over the coming months.</p> <p>\"It is a big issue now what the [electricity] price is going to be by the end of the year or this time next year.\"</p> <p>The one upside for industry is evidence that some manufacturers appear able to pass on price increases.</p> <p>In sectors such as the automotive industry, where long-term contracts have been awarded on the basis of annual price reductions, Mr Temple says there is anecdotal evidence that cost increases are being passed on. \"For the first time, people are now seeing prices are having to go up.\"</p> <p>Mr Cooke argues that for companies supplying products for which the main component is steel, higher prices are essential. \"If industries don't pass on the price increases, they won't be there.\"</p>",

  "<p>The people of St Albans are openly flouting the law. And loving it. </p> <p>For within the narrow town streets dotted with pubs and patisseries, locals are leaving their cars wherever they like, fully confident there will be no tickets on the windscreens when they return. </p> <p>Traffic wardens will not operate here until October because of a bureaucratic glitch, and vehicles left for hours across double yellow lines is now a sight to which locals have grown well accustomed. </p> <p>Some drive directly to the store they want and park under its shop window. At a whim, people will leave cars in any direction across the pavements and directly under no parking signs by the clock tower in the town centre. </p> <p>\"Oh everyone knows,\" says Brian Hindle, looking at a row of cars flagrantly parked across double yellow lines down the street. </p> <p>\"You just do it, you know, in St Albans you can get away with it. There are signs but no one enforces them - I've have never seen a traffic warden in the place.\" </p> <p>And St Albans district council cannot do anything about it. Well, not until October 4, when the lawlessness will come to an abrupt end once the council finds a taker for its \u00a335m traffic warden contract. </p> <p>This descent into anarchy all began in April, when Hertfordshire police stopped providing a county-wide traffic warden service - leaving the role to be taken up by local councils. </p> <p>Despite being notified about the move in July last year, the council said it had not had adequate time to find a solution. A spokeswoman said yesterday: \"Until October we don't have the legislative powers to enforce parking restrictions. We can't actually carry out any enforcement until our new contract begins. </p> <p>\"So we are reliant on police until then to enforce the yellow line rules - which the police have agreed to do.\" </p> <p>But the word around town is, it is worth taking the risk. Since about January, no one seems to have seen traffic wardens. And while the convenience is blissful for those wandering around the shops, businesses are cursing the council for not having the forethought to predict the effects. </p> <p>The owner of a crystal healing shop, Philip Permutt, says the cars block the pavement on both sides of his store, stop ping people from coming inside. \"Someone at the council should be shot,\" he said yesterday. \"It's a joke.\" </p> <p>Across the road at the Boot pub a car is parked diagonally, obstructing an entrance. </p> <p>\"I hate it, absolutely hate it,\" the pub's owner, Will Hughes, said. \"But he will just park there because no one will stop him. The shop next door has just spent half a million pounds on a beautiful new shopfront and the cars will come and park directly in front of it on the pavement. </p> <p>\"People just do whatever they want to do, it's ridiculous - and the council does nothing about it.\" </p> <p>The owner of a novelty establishment, Topgeeza, who wished to be known only as Gus, said it had been impossible to get the police or the council to do anything about the problem. He calls them on most market days when it becomes difficult to move through the street because of the haphazard parking arrangements. </p> <p>\"They won't come because it just seems like such a small problem,\" he said. \"But on a Saturday morning all you hear is 'Beeeeeeeep!' constantly between nine and 12, with cars just hitting the horns to try and get through. There's no control, it's affecting trade.\" </p> <p>And where does he park? </p> <p>\"Oh,\" he laughs sheepishly, \"Well actually, I park here myself ... we've been doing it since we knew we could get away with it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain has almost 4 million \"hidden poor\", and they come from a wider cross-section of society than might be expected, according to new research from the Elizabeth Finn Trust. </p> <p>The charity, known until two years ago as the Distressed Gentlefolk's Aid Association, says research conducted on its behalf by the Future Foundation found that people from \"solid career backgrounds\" are increasingly falling beneath the poverty line and struggling to cope. </p> <p>Some 3.8m people - a sizeable chunk of whom have a background in jobs ranging from teaching and the civil service to software professionals and accountants - are struggling with a slide into poverty as a result of what tend to be societal changes beyond the individual's control. </p> <p>The report concludes that these people are likely to struggle on without asking for assistance - often because they are independent and self-reliant, and too embarrassed to ask for help. </p> <p>The research drew on data from the Office of National Statistics and the government's Household Survey, as well as interviews and focus groups. The main reasons for so many people from apparently secure career backgrounds ending up in poverty are wide-ranging and can be down to sudden life-changing events such as illness, redundancy and old age, it says. Many of those affected have been hit hard by the financial impact of changing social trends such as higher divorce rates. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the trust says this makes the work the charity does all the more important. \"Once people are suffering from financial pressures, they find it very difficult to seek help,\" she says. </p> <p>\"They begin to distance themselves from their family and friends and so feel unsupported during times of emotional hardship.\" </p> <p>The charity offers financial assistance and emotional support and advice to people from 120 designated occupations who are experiencing hard times. It also offers assistance to their families. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>To check who qualifies for help, go to: <a href=\"http://www.elizabethfinntrust.org.uk\">www.elizabethfinntrust.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Around two-thirds of the UK population are overweight or obese, and this figure is rising rapidly. Preventing people becoming overweight in the the first place is, of course, essential, but so too is clinical treatment for those already obese. And it is this latter, strangely unfashionable approach that is in danger of being neglected by policy makers and the NHS. </p> <p>There has been a strong media focus on cause and prevention of obesity in recent months. My concern is that this will lead to treatment being marginalised. My own experience as a GP is that the NHS generally regards obesity as a \"lifestyle\" problem, for which treatment is an optional extra. Certainly, many primary care trusts (PCTs) are reluctant to sanction approved treatments for obesity, in a way which would be unthinkable were the condition in question heart disease or diabetes. </p> <p>This represents a huge missed opportunity. Obesity has grown by over 400% in the last 25 years and may soon surpass smoking as the most prevalent cause of premature death. Latest estimates suggest that obesity-related management costs in excess of \u00a33bn per year. Obesity is a principal contributory factor in a number of potentially fatal conditions. Compared to their leaner counterparts, obese people are at significantly higher risk of contracting coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes and depression. </p> <p>The government is trying hard to reverse the rising obesity trend, and has committed extensive funding to drive cohesive exercise programmes for both adults and schoolchildren. It is also widely expected to target obesity in its forthcoming white paper, Choosing Health. Ministers are also reviewing the recommendations of the Commons Health Select Committee, calling for healthy-eating public-awareness campaigns, controls on juvenile-focused advertising, and the introduction of more affordable healthy foods. </p> <p>This is commendable, but in order to maintain the momentum it is essential that all relevant obesity bodies work in tandem. For example, in the clinical sector, the National Institute of Clinical Excellence has approved two medications for the management of obesity. Sibutramine makes patients feel fuller sooner and therefore encourages them to eat less, while Orlistat reduces the absorption of dietary fat. </p> <p>Despite this, some PCTs have instructed doctors not to prescribe these medications. This displays a lack of understanding and unethically disregards potentially fatal repercussions such as heart disease and cancer. Weight loss of only 10% can reap substantial health benefits, decreasing the likelihood of an obesity-related death by 40%. Clinical management can safely evoke weight losses of this magnitude, with data showing that weight lost can be sustained for at least four years. </p> <p>It is therefore essential that as well as targeting obesity prevention, we focus on treating patients who are already clinically obese. To help facilitate this, plans are underway in several key organisations to develop an all-encompassing nutrition and activity task force. This umbrella organisation would oversee the development and implementation of a number of innovative obesity prevention and weight-management initiatives, providing a much-needed cornerstone for co-ordinating current and future initiatives. </p> <p>Individuals must take personal responsibility for their health, but the NHS must play a leading role in making weight control a realistic possibility in those who want to regain control of their health in this way. </p> <p>Decision-makers in the NHS must recognise both the need for, and the effectiveness of, weight management; and they must adequately resource this work. Not to do so is to fall short of our own responsibilities. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Ian Campbell is a GP and president of the National Obesity Forum, an independent group of healthcare practitioners with a special interest in obesity.</p>",
  "The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, has adopted a Russian orphan, it was reported yesterday. <p>Three-year-old Victoria, from St Petersburg, has been living at the Schr\u00f6ders' family home in Hanover in northern Germany for several weeks. </p> <p>The chairman of the chancellor's Social Democrat party, Franz Muentefering, confirmed the report. \"I wish them all the best together,\" he told reporters. </p> <p>The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had been informed of Mr Schr\u00f6der's intention to adopt a Russian child. </p> <p>\"The decision was made fully in line with Russian law, based on the decision of a Russian court,\" a Kremlin source told the Russian news agency Interfax, adding that Doris Schr\u00f6der-Kopf, the chancellor's wife, was present in court for the final decision. </p> <p>It has been an emotional month for Mr Schr\u00f6der, who turned 60 in April and is facing almost weekly street demonstrations against his attempts to reform the flagging German economy. </p> <p>Last week he made his first visit to the grave of his father, who was a conscript in the Nazi army and was killed by Romanian villagers during the second world war. </p> <p>It is not clear when Victoria arrived at the Schr\u00f6der's home. Neighbours say that Ms Schr\u00f6der-Kopf has been seen carrying the toddler in the garden for several weeks, according to the German daily Bild. </p> <p>It appears that the whole Schr\u00f6der family flew to Russia a few weeks ago to collect the toddler. </p> <p>The addition to the family was such a closely guarded secret that the secret service agency which provides Mr Schr\u00f6der's bodyguards was told \"the Schr\u00f6ders will be four\" just before they arrived at the plane to fly them home, Bild reported. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der's last official visit to Russia was on July 8, when he led a delegation of about 30 German business men on a one-day visit to Mr Putin. </p> <p>Victoria is the couple's second child. Ms Schr\u00f6der-Kopf, a 41-year old former journalist and the chancellor's fourth wife, has a 13-year-old daughter, Klara, from a previous relationship. </p> <p>A successful children's author, Ms Schr\u00f6der-Kopf has dedicated herself to promoting children's causes, and has published a book of essays explaining politics to young Germans, called The Chancellor Lives in the Swimming Pool. </p> <p>In September 2003 she became a patron of a charity, First European Friendship Touring, which aids orphanages in Europe, including those in St Petersburg. </p> <p>Adopting a baby from Russia can be a notoriously difficult process, which can take up to two years to complete. The process is made more complicated as the parents of most of the 184,000 children living in Russian orphanages are still alive. </p> <p>Zhenya Antropova, who deals with orphanages at the Charity Aid Foundation in Moscow, said: \"Many, if not most, of the children in Russian orphanages are social orphans. Their parents are alive, but they are either alcoholics or in jail. The orphanages are simply used as a dumping ground by parents who can't cope with their offspring.\"</p>",
  "<p> While their sporting name might be more synonymous with horse racing, Ahmed al-Maktoum achieved a gold medal for his famous family yesterday on a historic afternoon of shooting. </p> <p>In his victory in the double trap competition, the sheikh from the United Arab Emirates broke one Olympic record and equalled another. In finishing second Rajyavardhan Rathore produced the best individual performance at an Olympics by an Indian in any event since the country's independence 57 years ago. </p> <p>Great Britain's defending champion Richard Faulds failed to make the final but the 40-year-old Maktoum produced a near-immaculate display. He missed only 11 times out of 200 and such was his dominance in the final that his first 34 attempts were hits. </p> <p>He lives in Dubai and is a cousin of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the country's crown prince, Sheikh Maktoum Rashid al-Maktoum and Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashin al-Maktoum. Their triumphs as breeders and owners of some of the world's best racehorses hardly need elaboration but now they have a gold medallist among the family as well. </p> <p>\"I never thought I could become an Olympic champion,\" Maktoum said afterwards. \"As my country was up-and-coming we did not have the facilities of a shooting range. I started when I was 34. Once we did, I had the opportunity and the support.\" </p> <p>And, he might have added, the talent. He is also a former national squash champion and was a hunter from as early as he can remember. \"It is a tradition in our country and I started when I was very young. My father tells me stories that he used to take me hunting when I was four and at that time I could not shoot. Shooting is in my blood.\" </p> <p>In the opening three qualification rounds, his 144 hits out of 150 beat the Olympic record by one and then his overall score matched the games' best. He beat Rathore by 10 but the Indian's second place was still cause for celebration. He said: \"Cricket is our main sport but maybe people will now realise the importance of an Olympic medal.\" </p> <p>As for Faulds, the defence of his title was over after the first round when he missed nine targets and he was never able to catch up. He will spend the winter contemplating his Olympic future and said: \"I am bitterly disappointed. I did not settle well, it did not flow and it did not happen. There is always four years' time but I am not making any promises.\"</p>",
  "<p>The morning after Tim Henman lost his first-round Olympic singles match in straight sets he went looking for Simon Clegg, the chef de mission of Team GB. \"He came to see me on Monday to apologise for his performance,\" Clegg said yesterday. \"It was big of him. He said he'd let himself down and let the team down. That shows you what kind of a guy he is.\" </p> <p>The way things are going Clegg could be receiving a lot more visitors bearing humble apologies before these games are over. Already the tabloids have been calling, half-seriously, for the athletes to be brought home before they can inflict further humiliation on a public battered by a series of summer sporting disasters, with only the success of the cricket team to numb the pain. </p> <p>Four days after the opening ceremony in Athens things have not gone well for Britain's contingent. Within hours of the Olympic flame being lit, Craig Fallon, the lightweight judoka fancied for a medal had disappointed. Henman went out before most people had registered his presence. Nicole Cooke's tactical naivety cost her a medal in the cycling road race. Darren Mew and James Gibson failed to live up to expectations in the swimming pool and Melanie Marshall finished last in her semi-final, all of which cast sudden doubts on the methods of their much-praised Australian coach, Bill Sweetenham. In the trap shooting, which produced a gold and silver four years ago, Sarah Gibbins, Ian Peel and Ed Ling were unable to make their finals. </p> <p>Yesterday Stephen Parry doubled Britain's medal total with a bronze in the 200 metres butterfly but Richard Faulds failed to defend his Sydney gold medal in the double trap, while the three-day-event team fell from first to fourth position with one day to go with Pippa Funnell and William Fox-Pitt dropping out of the individual medal positions altogether. </p> <p>And all this comes a couple of days before Britain's track and field squad, the smallest since Moscow in 1980, enter the main Olympic stadium in Athens dismally unburdened by serious expectations of winning medals, with the exception of Paula Radcliffe, who may or may not be suffering from a mysterious injury. </p> <p>As a result critics have been questioning the way the team has used a four-year budget approaching \u00a3100m, including \u00a365m channelled through UK Sport from the national lottery. </p> <p>Somehow, the fact that the better of Britain's two medals to date came from the synchronised divers has made the position worse, rather than better. If two blokes in a joke sport can win a silver after training in separate cities for a discipline that requires total unity of thought and action, then surely the athletes who failed can have done so only through some lack of preparation or effort or moral fibre. </p> <p>Clegg was having none of that yesterday. On the eve of the games he had spoken eloquently of the difference an early medal makes, contrasting the experience of Atlanta, where Britain won a single gold medal out of a total of 15, with that of Sydney, where 11 of the team's 28 medals were gold. </p> <p>\"When Jason Queally got his gold on the first day in Sydney,\" Clegg said on Friday, \"it took everyone by surprise and it turned out to be a fantastic result for everyone. You could see the effect in the village, where British athletes were suddenly walking tall. If we can get off to a good start here, possibly with the judo or the synchronised diving or Nicole Cooke, I think it will be good for the whole team.\" </p> <p>Yesterday he was sounding more defensive. \"We couldn't have asked for a better start,\" he said. \"To get a silver medal on day one of the Games was a fantastic way to get going and it couldn't have happened to a nicer couple of guys. They've been great team members and they've been very generous about sharing their medals - telling everyone what it feels like. </p> <p>\"Since then we've had some good results and some disappointing ones. But the general mood is still upbeat. The hockey team beat Egypt, although unfortunately they got pipped by Korea this morning by a single goal. The sailors are in the lead in three classes, which is wonderful. And I've just been down at the canoe slalom, where Stuart McIntosh has qualified for the semi-finals. There's Richard Kruse in the fencing - to go through to the last eight was fantastic. And in the diving the girls very narrowly missed a medal - one of them beat her personal best by 15 points and you can't ask for more than that.\" </p> <p>Yes, but meanwhile we have to stand by and watch our neighbours forging ahead. The French are celebrating their first gold medal in the swimming pool for half a century, through the 17-year-old Laure Manaudou in the 400m freestyle, while the Italians exult over Paolo Bettini, who lived up to his reputation in the men's road race, and the Germans applaud Yvonne Boenisch in the judo. </p> <p>\"We've got to remember that sport is sport and it's not predictable,\" Clegg retorted. \"If it was, it wouldn't be sport. It's about 16 days of competition, not one or two. We came here knowing that our strongest medal chances would be back-loaded. We're all excited about the track cycling team, who're starting shortly. It's true that the swimmers haven't achieved some of the results they'd have wanted but Stephen Parry dominated his 200m butterfly semi-final right from the start. He was out of the blocks in 0.71 of a second and he beat Michael Phelps.\" Clegg said he was looking forward to the final, which did indeed yield a reward for Parry. </p> <p>He could also have mentioned the rowers, hoping to repeat the multi-medal euphoria of Sydney, and the would-be successors to Stephanie Cook in the modern pentathlon. But if the days pass without more significant triumphs, he will find himself coming under greater pressure, not least from those wishing to use any sign of weakness in Athens as a stick with which to scourge London's bid to host the games in 2012. </p> <p>\"Look,\" he said, casting back for a parallel in recent history, \"in Salt Lake City in 2002 we were being accused of spending \u00a35m on giving people winter holidays. A week later we were having our most successful Winter Games since 1936.\" </p> <p>It is reasonable, then to accept that an obituary for the British team at this stage would be cruel and premature. Let us give them time. They are all doing the best they can, and eventually, in a few more cases, their best may prove good enough. </p> <p>But it still looks as though an awful lot of Britain's hopes will be riding on the slender shoulders of Radcliffe when she crosses the start line in the village of Marathon on Sunday, particularly in the light of the rumours about her condition as she arrived in the village early this week. </p> <p>\"At the moment there's no concern about her at all,\" Clegg said. But would it not be a worry if such an iconic figure went lame? \"She's one of 271 athletes out here with the team,\" he replied briskly, \"and we have to support them all on an equal basis.\" </p> <p>But for all their marvellous variety on show at the Olympics, running is the heart of the matter, and Britain has never been less impressively equipped with world-class runners than at these games. Of our 58 track and field athletes, after all, only 31 managed to achieve the Olympic \"A\" qualifying standard - something that certainly should be the subject of a post-games inquest. </p> <p>As a 30-year-old product of the old club system who has embraced the latest training techniques, Radcliffe provides the team with a symbol both of past glories and the kind of dedication needed to succeed in the modern world. As things stand, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that more than a single gold medal will hang on her fortunes in the coming days. </p> <p> <strong>The remaining hopes</strong></p> <p><strong> Archery</strong> </p> <p>Alison Williamson, Naomi Folkard (women's quarter-finals, today) </p> <p><strong> Athletics</strong> </p> <p>Paula Radcliffe (women's marathon) </p> <p>Kelly Holmes (women's 800m/1500m) </p> <p>Darren Campbell (men's 200m) </p> <p>Men's 4x100m relay </p> <p><strong> Badminton</strong> </p> <p>Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms (mixed doubles; semi-final, today) </p> <p><strong> Boxing</strong> </p> <p>Amir Khan (lightweight; Friday) </p> <p><strong> Canoeing</strong> </p> <p>Stuart McIntosh (men's C1; semi-final, today) </p> <p>Helen Reeves (women's K1; semi-final, today) </p> <p><strong> Cycling</strong> </p> <p>Chris Hoy (men's 1km time trial) </p> <p>Jamie Staff (Keirin) </p> <p>Bradley Wiggins (men's individual pursuit) </p> <p>Men's team sprint </p> <p><strong> Modern pentathlon</strong> </p> <p>Georgina Harland, Kate Allenby </p> <p><strong> Rowing</strong> </p> <p>Matthew Pinsent, James Cracknell, Steven Williams, Ed Coode (men's coxless four; semi-finals today) </p> <p>Cath Bishop, Kath Grainger (women's coxless pair; repechage today) </p> <p>Ian Lawson (men's single scull; semi-final, today) </p> <p><strong> Sailing</strong> </p> <p>Ben Ainslie (Finn single-handed) </p> <p>Shirley Robertson, Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb (Yngling) </p> <p>Nick Rogers, Joe Glanfield<strong> </strong> </p> <p>(470 men) </p> <p><strong> Taekwondo</strong> </p> <p>Sarah Stevenson (women over 67kg) </p> <p>Paul Green (men's under 58kg)</p>",
  "<p>Giang Ding was enjoying the cool and quiet of the lobby at the Hanoi Hilton last night, but he can still vividly remember the sounds and sights of the Vietnamese capital when it was being bombed by the United States in the early 1970s.</p> <p>Then he was a child, waiting to be evacuated into the countryside but now, after a wider odyssey around Europe, he is back working in his home city as a software engineer for a British company. \"I remember particularly the bombs on Christmas night in 1972. I can still feel the mood of the people, even though now the most we have to face is the speed of change,\" Mr Ding said. </p> <p>Vietnam still conjures up images of war, if only through films such as Apocalypse Now, to many in the west. Others still think of it as a struggling, third world economy that produced the boat people and is totally dependent on agricultural exports. But these views are rapidly appearing outdated as the south-east Asian country, led by IT experts such as Mr Ding, muscles its way on to the world stage. The 38-year-old software specialist works for London-based IT recruitment company Harvey Nash.</p> <p>He is one of a large number of locals who have returned to the country after working abroad - in his case Austria and Germany - armed with new skills and knowledge. Mr Ding went to the German Democratic Republic as part of an exchange programme with the eastern bloc organised by communist-run Hanoi.</p> <p>Others returning to Vietnam are former boat people who have returned with a variety of new languages from Europe, Japan and elsewhere in the far east. This linguistic goldmine, in a country where French and English have been spoken widely for many years, has been one of the major attractions for Harvey Nash.</p> <p>The London Stock Exchange-listed company could have chosen India, China or even South Africa as an outsourcing centre, but instead has pioneered Vietnam's entry into this fast-growing sector of international business.</p> <p>Paul Smith, the managing director of Harvey Nash's software development division, says he has been attracted by the fact that the firm can offer work for a variety of different developed countries because of the language bank in Vietnam.</p> <p>But he also talks of the \"huge thirst for knowledge\" shown by young Vietnamese people. The children of a trouble-hit generation have \"channelled their tenacity and energy into the software market\". </p> <p>They have been encouraged to do so by the government, which is still nominally communist but, like China, is increasingly embracing aspects of the capitalist system. </p> <p>The Hanoi authorities have thrown their weight behind outsourcing since signing a first joint-venture with Harvey Nash in 1999. An office block in the centre of Hanoi owned by Harvey Nash now employs 625 staff working on highly skilled software development work for clients such as Honda, the Discovery Channel and even the Prince's Trust.</p> <p>\"We chose not to go to India because although they were very good at doing volume copying of software they were not raising their quality and architecture,\" says Mr Smith. Since then, India has been hit by rising costs and skill shortages while China continues to struggle against cultural and language barriers in addition to little quality assurance, he believes.</p> <p>Vietnam has the opportunity to overtake both India and China as a highly skilled, English-speaking workforce emerges from Hanoi university, according to Mr Smith.</p> <p>Political stability and government incentives encourage foreign companies to move outsourcing to a country which has embraced CMM, the quality control monitoring system developed by American space agency Nasa. </p> <p>Harvey Nash says its Vietnamese programmers with four years' experience earn $400 (\u00a3219) to $500m a month - compared to 10 times this figure for similarly qualified staff in Britain. </p> <p>Colin Heath, the head of management information systems at the Prince's Trust charity in London, is pleased he took the decision to outsource IT development to Vietnam just under a year ago.</p> <p>He looks after 17 local British staff who would be overwhelmed if they could not have brought in outside help, he argues. \"It has enabled us to concentrate our very limited resources as a charity on the things we really know best about,\" he says.</p> <p>The organisation, which provides help for children and adults with drug-related or other problems, has been able to develop a series of IT services to help it run more efficiently.</p> <p>\"To be honest, it is less of an issue as to where [geographically] this work is done than whether it is managed properly. So far it's proved to be excellent,\" said Mr Heath.</p> <p>Harvey Nash has concentrated until now on the higher value end of the market and has avoided the call centre model. But it believes that in two years' time, it will be offering more general outsourcing services of the type common in India and China.</p> <p>Mr Smith is not the only executive singing the praises of Vietnamese productivity and capability. </p> <p>Digby Jones, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, is due to visit the region in October. He has already spoken about Britain falling behind in the skills stakes and has singled out Vietnam as a nation which is fast moving up the value chain through concerted effort.</p> <p>Honda, BMW and Mercedes-Benz are among the big manufacturing names which have already developed a significant presence in Vietnam, while tourism has become a major earner.</p> <p>After six months back in Hanoi Mr Ding admits to still missing Europe's countryside and theatres, but he is excited by the vibrancy and rapid changes taking place in his native land. \"Many people think we just grow rice or export shrimps. I think it is good to show we can compete on the world stage in the hi-tech sector, too.\"</p> <p><strong>Service overcomes movie stereotype</strong></p> <p>Vietnam appears to have won the support of another large British client to add to its growing outsourcing business. </p> <p>Electrocomponents is in Hanoi assessing whether to give a contract to the country through Harvey Nash. </p> <p>Steve Simpson, an e-commerce development director with the firm, said he was impressed by what he had seen on his trip. \"I have been measuring them up against India and it's quite a compelling story here. We want speed to market, quality support and of course good costs. I have not seen anything yet to put me off.\" </p> <p>The FTSE 150 distributor of electronic, electrical and industrial equipment with an annual turnover of about \u00a3750m is being offered IT help at what it believes is a fraction of the costs in Britain. </p> <p>Mr Simpson says no UK jobs would go if it opted for Vietnam and is just looking for additional capacity to feed a growing online business. He has looked at using India but is worried by the huge volumes moving out there which are pushing up prices. </p> <p>He admits his initial impressions about the country came mainly from Hollywood movies. </p> <p>But in the two days he has been there he has been impressed by the service culture he has encountered. \"People really do want to do things for you.\"</p>",
  "<p>British Airways yesterday sought to avert a highly disruptive bank holiday strike by offering an improved pay deal which rewards its disgruntled check-in staff with a \u00a31,000 bonus if they cut back on their sick leave. </p> <p>The proposal drew a cautious response from unions, which said the airline was \"moving in the right direction\" and agreed to hold more talks today. </p> <p>But it came amid signs of infighting between union negotiators. The GMB, which narrowly voted for strike action last week, yesterday unexpectedly replaced its lead negotiator, national organiser Allan Black, with its London organiser, Ed Blisset, who has a reputation as a leftwinger. </p> <p>Insiders said there were disagreements over Monday's announcement that any strike would take place over the August bank holiday weekend, with a 24-hour walkout to begin on either August 27, 28, 29 or 30. </p> <p>Under the terms of BA's new offer, employees will get a bonus if they take fewer than 17 days off sick over two years. </p> <p>The money would be in addition to an 8.5% pay offer over three years. BA's operations director, Mike Street, said it effectively met the unions' demands of a 14.5% rise. </p> <p>Mr Street said: \"We think this is a sensible and attractive way forward. Improving absence has a major contribution to help us meet the challenge we face now and in the future.\" </p> <p>BA's check-in staff typically earn little more than \u00a312,000 annually. However, they take an average of 17 days' sick leave annually - compared to the national average of seven days per employee. </p> <p>Senior executives at the company privately say the problem is a hangover from BA's days as a nationalised industry. </p> <p>Unions say it is a result of understaffing and high stress levels. Mr Blisset said: \"We've got members who work outside in the cold and rain, then come inside and face passengers with minor infections.\" </p> <p>He said the new offer made him \"more hopeful\" that disruption could be avoided. </p> <p>But he insisted that money should not be linked to sick leave: \"As yet, this doesn't meet the aspirations of our members.\" </p> <p>The Transport &amp; General Workers' Union, which represents more than 8,000 ground staff compared to the GMB's 3,000, is likely to reveal the results of its own strike ballot on Thursday. </p> <p>A source close to the negotiations said the T&amp;G was irritated with a lack of comradely behaviour by the GMB, which announced strike dates without any prior agreement. Insiders accused Mr Blisset of leaking the timing of the strike behind the back of Mr Black, who subsequently stepped back from the negotiations yesterday afternoon. </p> <p>Mr Blisset, nicknamed \"Red Ed\", is a hardliner who was accused last year of escalating a series of wildcat walkouts by BA's Heathrow staff by refusing to attend negotiations. A former Labour party member, he quit the party in protest at Tony Blair's policies. </p> <p>More than 100,000 people plan to fly with BA each day over the bank holiday weekend. A 24-hour stoppage would halt services at nine airports across Britain. City analysts said this could cost BA up to \u00a310m. The airline admits that with flights fully booked it would struggle to re-route passengers on other carriers.</p>",
  "<p>Lloyds TSB is breaching the Data Protection Act by outsourcing work to India, its union representatives claimed yesterday. </p> <p>The Lloyds TSB Group Union, which campaigned against the closure of the bank's Newcastle call centre, has asked the information commissioner, who polices the act, to consider its case. </p> <p>Steve Tatlow, assistant general secretary of the LTU, said the union had taken advice from the solicitors Bindmans. The case against Lloyds was based on the union's belief that India did not have the standards of data protection required by British laws. </p> <p>Some 1,000 jobs are being shed at Lloyds' Newcastle call centre as a result of the bank's decision to move the work to India. </p> <p>The union cited European law, which stipulates that personal data can be transferred outside the European Economic Area only with the consent of customers. Bindmans has said it believes customers must give written consent for their data to be transferred to a country that does not have the same legal safeguards as Britain. </p> <p>The union is yet to hear from the information commissioner of its views about Lloyds TSB, which will close its Newcastle call centre by the end of the month. </p> <p>Lloyds insisted it had not breached the Data Protection Act nor put its customers' records at risk. </p> <p>\"Security is of the utmost importance. We have put a number of measures in place so that the protection of customer data is paramount,\" a bank spokeswoman said. Under the terms of the Data Protection Act, customer permission was not required, provided the personal records had to \"adequate\" protection. </p> <p>The Information Commissioner's Office refused to comment on this specific case. But a spokeswoman said: \"There are various bases in law which can be used to legitimise the transfer overseas of personal data. Consent from the individual is just one of them. </p> <p>\"Should a data controller, subject to UK law, outsource work outside the European Economic Area, they will remain responsible for that data. In particular, it must be afforded appropriate security and not be used or disclosed other than for its legitimate business purpose.\"</p>"
