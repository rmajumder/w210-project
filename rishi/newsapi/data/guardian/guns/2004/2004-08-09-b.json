  "As a former soldier and a leading member of his local Pakistani community, Mahmood Hussain carries enormous credibility with Muslim voters. So when the soft-spoken 56-year-old warns that his beloved Labour party faces a battle to win back Muslims in Luton, Downing Street should take notice. <p>\"I was opposed to the Iraq war, I was not convinced by Tony Blair and considered leaving the Labour party,\" said Mr Hussain, who knows about the horrors of war after being wounded during the 1965 India-Pakistan conflict. A Labour member for 37 years and now chairman of his constituency party, he joined the party within a month of arriving in Britain after being thrown into a Pakistani jail for protesting against the 1965 war. Mr Hussain eventually decided to stay with the party he has supported for so long. </p> <p>Others have not, as Labour found out last year when all three Labour councillors in Biscot were unseated by Muslim Liberal Democrat candidates. \"The voters will punish Labour. This could be another Leicester South [where the Lib Dems went from third to first place in a recent byelection],\" says Qurban Hussain, a former Labour councillor who spearheaded the Lib Dem assault in Biscot, a deprived ward where 60% of voters are Asian. </p> <p>Labour should - in normal times - look forward to holding the two seats of Luton South and Luton North. The party won both of them from the Conservatives in 1997 and retained them at the last general election with well over half the vote. Labour knows, though, that Luton's voters have changed sides regularly over the past 50 years, backing the winning party at every general election since 1951. And these are anything but normal times in a town where Muslims, who form a sizeable majority of the town's ethnic minority population, will play a decisive role in the election. </p> <p>To complicate the picture, Luton's two Labour MPs took opposing views on the war. Margaret Moran, the loyalist MP for Luton South, voted in favour of the conflict. Kelvin Hopkins, the rebellious MP for Luton North, should feel more comfortable because he voted against the war. </p> <p>But Mahmood Hussain sounded a warning note. \"I stood in Kelvin's area during the local elections. We told voters we had both opposed the war. I lost because voters said: 'But you are part of the Labour party.'\" </p> <p>Against this background, Labour is undertaking a huge effort to try to persuade Muslim voters that the government provides the best hope for a town which has struggled to cope with the closure of much of its industry despite new employers such as the booming local airport. Ministers hope that Labour's record investment in public services will appeal to Muslims, many of whom have struggled to find work after being attracted to Luton in the early 1970s by jobs at the Vauxhall and Bedford car plants. </p> <p>As part of Labour's campaign, Robin Cook used a visit to Luton's Central Mosque to urge Muslims to stick with Labour even though he shared their opposition to the war. </p> <p>For many Muslims, this is an unacceptable attempt to dismiss the defining event of their lives. As he left lunchtime prayers at the central mosque, Mahmud Ahmad said: \"I respect Robin Cook but I do not agree with him about voting Labour.\" </p> <p>Mr Ahmad, 40, who is married with five children, said he is deeply angered by the targeting of his community by police, who arrested a man in the town last week. </p> <p>\"It is like the Soviet Union,\" he said. \"I am a British citizen. I have a beard and am a different colour but I have done everything according to the law. And yet I am suffering. I go for job interviews and do not get the job even though I have the qualifications. I am a devout person but I am not a terrorist.\" </p> <p>His remarks show the depth of feeling in Biscot, where Muslims shop in Halal butchers and DVD stores sell the latest films from Pakistan. The challenge facing Labour is demonstrated by a poster in the Al Madina superstore which declares: \"Countdown to the deceptive handover of sovereignty in Iraq.\" </p> <p>Fida Bukhari, a Labour voter since the 1970s, said he was jumping ship to the Tories. A successful local businessman, Mr Bukhari said: \"My wife and I are walking away from Labour. I think all Muslims are the same. Michael Howard has a credible position because he says that he would not have supported the war if he had known there would be no weapons of mass destruction.\" </p> <p>Others take a more charitable view of Labour. Akbar Dad Khan, of the Building Bridges group, believes that Muslims will continue to vote Labour, though they will do so with a \"heavy heart\". </p> <p>Speaking in the courtyard of the mosque, where his three young sons played catch after evening classes, Mr Khan said: \"Traditionally Muslims have voted Labour for 40 years. A large part of the Muslim community is not happy with Tony Blair but it recognises that for the sake of their own betterment the Labour party is their natural home.\" </p> <p>Labour strategists believe the results of June's European election bear this out. Labour topped the poll in Luton and the Lib Dems were a distant third. The Tories came well behind Labour. </p> <p>Labour also believes it has caught the Lib Dems playing the race card. In an echo of the row over the distribution of different leaflets to Asian and white communities in Leicester South, Labour has seized on a decision by the Lib Dem-controlled council to move the predominantly white ward of Round Green from an area committee which contained the largely Asian Biscot ward. Mahmood Hussain said: \"They haven't done it in racism terms but it is very close it.\" </p> <p>Highlighting such tactics may be paying off. As he rushed home after evening prayers, a respected member of the community said he would be standing by Labour. Shamsul Haque, 72, said: \"Labour. It's always Labour.\"</p>",
  "<p>Three wickets in 10 balls from Ajit Agarkar helped <strong> Middlesex</strong> to a 17-run victory over <strong> Leicestershire</strong> in a rain- affected Totesport Second Division match at Lord's. </p> <p>Middlesex were 215 for nine off 41.5 overs when the rains came and play was suspended for two hours. Leicestershire were then set a Duckworth/Lewis-adjusted target of 135 from 20 overs but were bowled out for 117. </p> <p>The Twenty20 Cup winners appeared to have the chase under control at 63 for two, with Brad Hodge continuing where he left off in Saturday's final at Edgbaston, but Melvyn Betts persuaded the Australian, on 24, to smash a long hop straight to point. </p> <p>Then Agarkar captured Darren Stevens, John Sadler and Jeremy Snape to finish with three for 22 from four overs, and Paul Weekes bowled Ottis Gibson with the first ball of the 16th over, whereupon the tail collapsed in a flurry of strokes to Ben Hutton, two for 17, and Glenn McGrath, one for 10. </p> <p>Claude Henderson had finished with four for 45 from nine overs to put the brakes on the Middlesex innings just when they looked like posting a much higher total. </p> <p>Crucially, in his second spell he lured Ed Joyce down the pitch and had him stumped just as the left-hander, with 31 from 41 balls, was starting to look really dangerous. </p> <p>Jamie Dalrymple top-scored for Middlesex with 40, made from 44 balls with three fours, and put on 52 for the fifth wicket with Joyce. </p> <p>Weekes (38) and Hutton (30) made the most of some wayward bowling to put on 58 before Hutton had his middle stump knocked out by Darren Maddy, who gave Leicestershire a modicum of control after others had served up a spate of wides. They conceded 31 in the innings, the worst culprit being Charlie Dagnall, who sent down 11, including eight in a three-over spell. </p> <p>In Chelmsford <strong> Essex</strong> made 107 without loss against <strong> Lancashire</strong> before the rain came and at the Rose Bowl, where <strong> Hampshire</strong> were to face <strong> Surrey</strong>, no play was possible and it was abandoned as a draw.</p>",
  "For generations they have been the tried and tested way of getting around Moscow. But Russia's capital is putting the squeeze on what locals call the \"Gypsy cabs\", with officials seeking to regulate rogue drivers and bring some order to the traffic-clogged streets. <p>With just 4,000 official taxis in this city of about 10 million, a more popular method for getting around is to stick out an arm and negotiate a fare with the first driver who stops. </p> <p>About 50-100 roubles (\u00a31-\u00a32) will get a traveller across town. </p> <p>The drivers, who tend to own dilapidated Ladas, can have varying backgrounds: from retired soldiers to professors. But the taxis are often unreliable and cabbies do not always know where they are going. </p> <p>\"A passenger in an illegal taxi cannot be sure he will arrive at his destination. He cannot be sure the car is in good condition,\" said Maria Protsenko of the city's transportation and communication department, which is developing new taxi regulations. </p> <p>The project, she said, would be presented to the Duma at the end of the month; a vote is expected in November. </p> <p>Taxi markings would be up to individual companies, she said. But drivers would have to pass medical and criminal background checks and display knowledge of the city. </p> <p>Ms Protsenko said Moscow aims to have 15,000 official taxis, to replace the 30,000-40,000 unofficial cabs. London, by comparison, has 19,000 official taxis.</p>",
  "<p>The prospect of a late summer strike at British Airways loomed large yesterday as trade unions hit out at \"insulting\" appeals for wage restraint after the airline revealed a recovery in its first-quarter profits to \u00a3115m. </p> <p>BA returned to the black in the three months to June following a dismal comparative period last year in which it made a loss of \u00a345m due to the war in Iraq and the Sars virus. </p> <p>The airline's chief executive, Rod Eddington, was careful to play down the figures, describing them as \"reasonable\" but warning that the outlook for fares remained \"challenging\". </p> <p>But unions, which are in the middle of balloting for strike action over pay, said the profits were evidence that BA could afford a far better deal than the 8.5% increase over three years which is now on the table. </p> <p>Brendan Gold, the national secretary for aviation at the Transport &amp; General Workers' Union, said: \"Those profits have been achieved with significant efforts from the workforce. Now it is time for the BA board to stop insulting them and agree their modest and reasonable claim to secure the future.\" </p> <p>The T&amp;G is balloting more than 8,000 check-in staff, baggage handlers and drivers for industrial action. More than 4,000 members of the GMB union are holding a parallel vote although a third union, Amicus, has agreed to enter arbitration. </p> <p>The unions say that settling their pay claim over three years would only cost \u00a370m - less than two months' profit. </p> <p>Results from the ballots are due to be announced by the end of next week. A strike could cause a second successive year of damaging and costly disruption in the middle of the summer holiday season. Wildcat walkouts by BA's Heathrow staff cost the airline nearly \u00a340m. Mr Eddington warned staff against assuming that the good times were back: \"Profits aren't nice to have, they're a 'must have'. </p> <p>\"If we don't make a profit, the business simply won't be robust and viable.\" </p> <p>BA revealed that the soaring cost of oil would push its spending on aviation fuel up by \u00a3225m this year - an increase of \u00a375m on its estimate in May. </p> <p>Both BA and Virgin Atlantic said they were increasing the \u00a32.50 surcharge levied on long-haul tickets to cover high fuel prices to \u00a36 from tomorrow. </p> <p>Mr Eddington suggested that passengers may have to get used to the surcharge as a permanent fixture. </p> <p>He pointed out that cargo customers already pay a levy which fluctuates according to the price of fuel. </p> <p>\"It's become part and parcel of the pricing mechanism with cargo,\" he said. \"Whether it goes that way with passengers is a moot point.\" </p> <p>BA's shares were unchanged on 205.5p following the figures, which were towards the top end of expectations. </p> <p>Analysts said although the airline was proving successful at keeping its costs down, it faced challenges ahead. Nick van den Brul, of BNP Paribas, said: \"They are a soft target when the oil price is where it is now and when they are facing the possibility of a strike.\" </p> <p>BA has become embroiled in a row over its fares with the Italian government. In an effort to prevent rivals from undercutting its ailing state carrier, Alitalia, Italy's aviation authority has ordered foreign airlines to raise their prices for long-haul tickets from Rome to New York. </p> <p>The European commission said it was looking into a complaint from BA, which says the order is a clear breach of competition regulations.</p>",
  "Afghanistan was never going to be a \"perfectly tidy place\", said Donald Rumsfeld a year after the Taliban had been defeated, when people were still being killed there. <p>But people were also being killed in New York, he added, so no one should really worry. Another 18 months on, as warnings of chaos multiply (the latest from our own Foreign Affairs Committee) the US defence secretary's optimism seems as false as it was flip. </p> <p>Over three million refugees have returned, but there is little aid to help many of them resettle on lands often blighted by years of drought. </p> <p>The drugs economy has boomed, to the benefit of both the Taliban and the warlords: Afghanistan is now the world's largest opium supplier. </p> <p>The country is less safe for foreign NGOs than under the Taliban: M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has been forced to pull out and this week two German aid workers were killed. </p> <p>Great claims are made for voter registration, ahead of presidential elections in October and parliamentary elections (already twice postponed) next April. </p> <p>Yet the Nato forces based in Kabul - which Europe's five-nation \"Eurocorps\" command took control of yesterday - have been far too thin on the ground to provide the necessary security. </p> <p>The only hopeful sign recently has been President Hamid Karzai's decision to take on the local tyrants by refusing to nominate his defence minister - and arch-warlord - Muhammad Qasim Fahim as one of two vice-presidential running mates. </p> <p>To do so, he had to resist pressure from US officials more keen on striking deals with the warlords whom they had enlisted in the war against the Taliban and al-Qaida. Some, including Mr Fahim, were already on the CIA's payroll during the Soviet occupation. </p> <p>Mr Fahim, whose power base lies with the ethnic Tajiks in the north, is now incensed that Mr Karzai has chosen a rival Tajik leader - brother of the late com mander Ahmed Shah Massoud. Last week, Mr Fahim said he would back education minister Yunus Qanooni (also an ethnic Tajik) for president, claiming it would be a peaceful power struggle, and that the \"time to pick up a gun\" was over. </p> <p>The value of such a pledge remains to be seen, coming as it does from the man who has done more than anyone else to frustrate the internationally approved plan to disarm the militias. </p> <p>Only 12,000 out of possibly 100,000 militia men have been demobilised, and the two corps controlled by Mr Fahim have been the least cooperative. </p> <p>Out of almost 5,000 heavy weapons and tanks, only 30% were handed in by a June deadline. </p> <p>Mr Karzai has enraged the warlords by arguing they are a bigger threat than the Taliban and his view was publicly shared by the outgoing head of the international force Lt Gen Rick Hillier, who said the warlords must be convinced that \"disarmament is irreversible\". </p> <p>Amazingly, the US ambassador to Afghanistan has undercut Mr Karzai's effort by soothing the warlords' feelings with assurances that they can be \"part of Afghanistan's future\". </p> <p>The irony is that the presidential election is only being held in October so that George W Bush can claim to have brought democracy to Kabul in time for his own election campaign. </p> <p>UN and European officials have been arguing in Afghanistan for some time that, now as in the past, opportunistic alliances with Afghan warlords merely store up trouble for the future. </p> <p>Now that Mr Karzai has taken the plunge, they should move quickly to give him enough backing to maximise his chances. </p> <p>This means providing all the aid which has been pledged but never delivered, and committing, immediately and on the ground, the extra troops that he was promised at the Nato summit in June. </p> <p>Support for vicious and corrupt despots hardly constitutes the \"milestone in the history of liberty\" that Mr Bush claims to have set up in this tragic country.</p>",
  "<p>One of the most interesting things about Baghdad these days, apart from all the car bombs, suicide bombers and errant mortars, is the transformation of our city into a huge collage of posters and billboards. </p> <p>And I don't mean the billboards that surround westerners. We have no ads for iPods plastered on bus stops: for one thing, we don't have bus stops, and as for iPods, i-what? </p> <p>No, the posters and billboards I'm talking about are a highly visual manifestation of the mish-mash that is Iraq today. </p> <p>Everyone is competing for the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people - the Americans, the new Iraqi government, the religious parties, the insurgents, the mujahideen and even young clerics such as Moqtada al-Sadr. And while the Americans are playing left against right, the insurgents are blowing up civilians and the Iraqi government are re-instituting the death penalty, all are using the same method to actually talk to the people: posters. And they are everywhere. </p> <p>So young Iraqi men and women in police uniforms grin from a big billboard for the ministry of the interior: \"We are serving our country. What are you doing?\" Another shows a sunset scene more suited to an airline ad. It's for a US-funded campaign, and combines statement with admonition: \"Iraq: the progress, the prosperity\", then, \"Iraq, your country can be better.\" </p> <p>Whole walls are covered with copies of one poster, which shows scenes from the good old times, the 70s in Baghdad - the last time that you could take a photo of the city and all the lights would be on. This one is meant to persuade Iraqis of the benefits of democracy, of elections and, chiefly, that one day the electricity will come back. </p> <p>Usually all these posters are torn down as fast as they are put up - even those for the Red Cross and other NGOs, and those for unexploded ordnance awareness campaigns. The only posters that survive the turmoil of Baghdad are those put up by the imams - Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the Shiite imams, Ali and co. - all in different positions: some praying, others killing lions, some with their heads bleeding or hearts shining light. Just months after the fall of Saddam, all the walls which used to be covered by murals in support of his regime are covered by pictures of old men with thick beards. It's very confusing. </p> <p>What is clear is that the posters are used to mark territories of influence - for example, Sadr city is now a huge collage of posters of Moqtada, in all sorts of shapes, colours and sizes. And his are the most artistic and imaginative. The most famous is a picture of him wagging his finger, threateningly. But he also has a whole series of himself posing with other clerics, and these change according to the political situation. There is the one of him and the Ayatollah al-Sistani, from when he tried to build an alliance with the old man. And there's one of him with Hassan Nasrallah, the head of the Islamic Lebanese Hizbullah, and a bunch of kids carrying RPGs. Then there are all kinds of posters featuring Moqtada himself with RPGs and machine guns, some with burned-out American humvees lying suggestively in the background. </p> <p>According to publishers, bookshop owners and printers, even the ubiquitous Moqtada is outdone by Ayatollah Sistani, who prints more than 50,000 posters every month. One printer recently told me that his profits have increased 10-fold since the fall of Saddam's regime. \"Before [the fall of Saddam] we had to get permission from the ministry of information for anything we wanted to publish, even for business cards. Today we're free. Yesterday I printed posters of Moqtada, and today I am printing chewing gum stickers.\" </p> <p>But anyone assuming that the boom in flyposting is only about the new reality - free enterprise, religious propaganda, American propaganda - is making a big mistake. \"I even printed a poster of Saddam the other month,\" says the printer. \"But that was only a thousand copies.\"</p>",
  "He walked with a spring in his step and always dressed up for work, strutting among the crowds wearing a smart striped suit and a grin from ear to ear. Young fans would cluster round him adoringly, thrusting autograph books under his nose as he gripped the pen awkwardly and scrawled his name across the page: T-I-G-G-E-R. <p>Today, however, there are no crowds to watch as Michael Chartrand, a character actor at Disney World, sits at home in Kissimmee, Florida. He has been suspended from his job since March after a 13-year-old girl claimed Tigger groped her breast with his big orange paw as they cuddled together for a photograph at the Magic Kingdom. </p> <p>Last week in a Florida court Chartrand was acquitted of molestation. He is now preparing to return to work - but not in the Tigger costume. \"It was my choice,\" he says. \"I told Disney I just wouldn't feel comfortable being Tigger again, not yet. Too much has happened.\" </p> <p>In the case of the State of Florida v Michael C Chartrand, played out over three days at the Orange County courthouse in Orlando, there was no real winner and more than one loser. His accuser went home glum in the knowledge that the jury did not believe her. Chartrand, 36, a dual-nationality British-American who moved to Florida last July after 26 years in the UK, left court relieved that his innocence had been proven, but fearful that his name has been tainted regardless. \"My life cannot be the same again, ever,\" he says. \"I am innocent, but I don't think the suspicion will ever be lifted.\" </p> <p>When he returns to work on August 22, he will play most of the characters he did before, including Goofy, Brer Bear, Captain Hook, Geppetto the carpenter from Pinocchio, and Governor Ratcliffe from the film Pocahontas. But he will miss playing Tigger. </p> <p>\"Being Tigger puts you into a happy mood. It gives you a cheerful feeling, it gives you twice the energy,\" he says wistfully. \"No matter how you felt in the morning, you could put on your costume and everything would go out the window; you'd turn into that character.\" </p> <p>Standing in his lounge, he gives an example of the trademark Tigger bounce. \"Before I did my bounce, I'd wave my arms around to make sure there were no children behind me, because the tail's quite hard and could hurt them, then I'd do it,\" he explains, bending his knees before leaping forth like a coiled spring. \"I think people were impressed.\" </p> <p>Despite the seriousness of the allegation and all that was at stake - Chartrand faced up to 15 years in jail if convicted - last week's trial at times represented a peculiar form of entertainment, spilling into public view the kind of behind-the-scenes secrets Disney would prefer to have kept to itself. </p> <p>The case featured everything from a debate over Tigger's gender, to a discussion as to exactly how many Tiggers can be on duty in the course of a day (for adult readers only: the answer is five, though only two may emerge into public areas at any one time and only under strictly controlled conditions so they cannot be seen together). Among them is one who is known to colleagues as \"Psycho-Tigger\" because of his high-energy antics. Another Tigger actor, Selbourne Larkin, 19, told the court that \"it's a real jolly job\" but confessed that he has since been fired for failing to turn up to work. </p> <p>So embarrassing has Chartrand's case been for Disney that it has now made all character actors sign new guidelines as to where they should place their hands - or paws - while posing with guests for photographs, to protect staff and guests alike against future trouble. </p> <p>\"Disney just wanted this story to disappear,\" says David Koenig, author of A Behind the Ears Look at Disneyland. \"They don't want publicity to the effect that Tigger is a guy in a costume. Disney is selling make-believe. It's an illusion, a magic trick. You can't enjoy it as much if you know what's behind it.\" </p> <p>For three days last week, courtroom 10D of the Orange County courthouse became a circus ring, in which that legendary Disney magic was paraded in the name of justice. As state prosecutor, William Jay had hoped to be the ringmaster, but found the role snatched away by defence lawyer Jeffrey Kaufman, who became the first member of his profession - and almost certainly the last - to deliver his summing-up to the jury from inside a Tigger costume. </p> <p>Disney, fiercely protective of its wholesome image, had not wanted the outfit produced as evidence in a sex trial and took a dim view of Kaufman's muffled voice being heard from within. It is a golden rule that Disney characters never speak; there is even special training so workers can learn how to cough in character. </p> <p>Kaufman is unrepentant. As well as being a partner in an Orlando law firm, the 37-year-old works part-time as Goofy and Tigger at Disney World and took Chartrand's case pro bono because he identified so strongly with his predicament. He says jurors needed to see how little vision and paw coordination the costume affords its wearer. </p> <p>\"I was thinking, 'I'm going to be a national joke walking around in this costume in front of a jury,'\" he says. \"But the jury needed to see it. I knew I'd look like a moron on TV.\" </p> <p>The Tigger costume, he admits, \"makes me kind of teary at times, because it means so much to so many people. It's what makes people love Disney. When you wear the costume, you become him, it changes who you are. Everybody loves you.\" </p> <p>Even the screening process for the 40-strong jury pool was bizarre. They were quizzed on issues including whether they had ever donned character costumes, a question that drew out a monkey, a Barney the Dinosaur and a sheepish revelation from one woman that she once kitted herself out \"kind of like a California raisin\" for a fancy-dress event. </p> <p>Jay also invited \"anybody who feels nothing ever bad happens at Disney\" to speak up and scanned for dissent as he asked: \"When you see a costume character, is everyone agreed that somewhere down there, there is a human?\" </p> <p>While discussing cartoon chipmunks Chip and Dale, Jay inadvertently referred to them as the Chippendales, a troupe of male strippers definitely not on Disney's audition list. The slip-up produced sniggers from the back of the courtroom. </p> <p>Judge Bob Wattles entered into the spirit too. \"I'm gonna wear my Mickey ears tomorrow on the bench,\" he quipped to a court officer at the end of the first day. </p> <p>Chartrand acknowledges the case might have seemed comical. But with his liberty on the line, he was haunted by its darker moments such as a courtroom confession by the investigating officer, Kevin Kraubetz. The detective admitted pressuring Chartrand into writing a \"letter of apology\" to his alleged victim, which was then kept as \"evidence\" of a \"crime,\" even though Chartrand did not know exactly what he was meant to have done and who his accuser was. </p> <p>Then there was the assertion by Jay at the start of the trial that the state would prove Chartrand \"had a certain appetite\" for girls aged 12 to 20. When the \"star witness\", Disney worker Danielle McCarthy, 29, was put on the stand to back that claim, she denied any such thing. </p> <p>At the heart of the case was a sensitive teenager from a broken family who said she went to Disney's Magic Kingdom for a fun day out and went home feeling \"embarrassed\" after apparently feeling Tigger's paw on her breast. </p> <p>Her mother's husband at the time - not the girl's biological father - testified that there was no incident. \"We all walked out of there laugh ing and having a good time,\" he said, adding that he and the girl's mother had since divorced in a deal whereby \"she got the money and I got a motorcycle\". </p> <p>The mother, however, claimed her former husband saw Tigger's wandering paw but has closed his eyes to it out of spite. She admitted in court that she had consulted a lawyer about suing Disney for damages before she gave a statement to police, but stood by her story that Tigger had strayed. \"Everything was fine with Pooh and Eeyore,\" she told the judge, bursting into tears. </p> <p>Chartrand has been supported by his family, including parents Roger and Linda, who live in north London, and sister Fran, who know him as a gentle, sweet-natured man. </p> <p>He was barred from Disney property for four months pending the outcome of the trial, but with the ban now lifted, he spent Sunday at Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park with his three nephews. \"Mickey and Minnie Mouse both grabbed my hand and squeezed it hard,\" he says. \"That meant everything.\"</p>",
  "This week, Madonna returns to her adopted homeland for the British leg of her Re-invention world tour.

After all, she takes home $2m (\u00a31.1m) per show, if the New York <b>Daily News</b> is to be believed. </p> <p>You don't want to sound as though you've got sour grapes, so you admit that at least Madonna is putting on the spectacle we have come to expect from her. </p> <p>After all, the <b>Washington Post</b> described the tour as an \"epic extravaganza\" that \"lifts and blends elements of Broadway, Cirque de Soleil, Rock the Vote rallies, art installations, extreme sporting events, church sermons, disco dances and gun-spinning military drills\". </p> <p>It's a show with a bit of everything. You know from the <b>Boston Globe</b> that there will be \"habits and burkas\", yoga and skateboarding, and a \"massive v-shaped catwalk above the audience\". </p> <p>Plus, the <b>Miami Herald</b> tells you, there's \"a tap-dancer, a trapeze troupe and sermons on Kabbalah\". What more could you ask for? </p> <p>How about some restraint, you huff in disgust, knowing that the <b>Chicago Tribune</b>'s music critic was equally unimpressed.

  "The US charge sheet against Iran is lengthening almost by the day, presaging destabilising confrontations this autumn and maybe a pre-election October surprise. <p>The Bush administration is piling on the pressure over Iran's alleged nuclear weapons programme. It maintains Tehran's decision to resume building uranium centrifuges wrecked a long-running EU-led dialogue and is proof of bad faith. </p> <p>The US will ask a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency on September 13 to declare Iran in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, a prelude to seeking punitive UN sanctions. </p> <p>Iran's insistence that it seeks nuclear power, not weapons, is scoffed at in Washington. John Bolton, the hawkish US under-secretary of state for arms control, says there is no doubt what Tehran is up to. He has hinted at using military force should the UN fail to act. \"The US and its allies must be willing to deploy more robust techniques\" to halt nuclear proliferation, including \"the disruption of procurement networks, sanctions and other means\". No option was ruled out, he said last year. </p> <p>Last month in Tokyo, Mr Bolton upped the ante again, accusing Iran of collaborating with North Korea on ballistic missiles. </p> <p>Israel, Washington's ally, has also been stoking the fire. It is suggested there that if the west fails to act against Iran in timely fashion, Israel could strike pre-emptively as it did against Iraq's nuclear facilities in 1981, although whether it has the capability to launch effective strikes is uncertain. </p> <p>The US has been pushing other countries to impose de facto punishment on Iran. Japan has been asked to cancel its $2bn (\u00a31.086bn) investment in the Azadegan oilfield and Washington has urged Russia to halt the construction of a civilian reactor. </p> <p>Condoleezza Rice, the US national security adviser, said at the weekend there was a new international willingness to confront Tehran, but declined to rule out unilateral action if others did not go along. </p> <p>That will fuel speculation in Tehran and elsewhere that the Bush administration may resort to force, with or without Israel, ahead of November's election. Options include \"surgical strikes\" or covert action by special forces. </p> <p>Such a move would be a high-risk gamble for George Bush. After the WMD fiasco, there would inevitably be questions about the accuracy of US intelligence. In the past Iran has vowed to retaliate. Although it is unclear how it might do so, the mood in Tehran has hardened since the conservatives won fiddled elections last winter. </p> <p>\"I think we've finally got the world community to a place, the IAEA to a place, that it is worried and suspicious,\" Ms Rice said in one of a string of interviews with CNN, Fox News and NBC television. She vowed to aim some \"very tough resolutions\" at Iran this autumn. \"Iran will either be isolated or it will submit,\" she said. </p> <p>Officials in London say she exaggerated the degree of unanimity on what to do next. Britain, France and Germany are the EU troika which has pursued a policy of \"critical engagement\" with Iran, despite US misgivings. </p> <p>Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, has invested considerably in resolving the issue, travelling to Tehran on several occasions. A diplomatic collapse would be a blow. </p> <p>\"There has been no such decision at all,\" a Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday of US efforts to take the dispute to the security council. \"The dialogue [with Iran] is ongoing and the government still believes that negotiation is the way forward at this stage.\" But Britain is in danger of being dragged down a path of confrontation that it does not want to travel. </p> <p>Nuclear weapons are not Washington's only worry. The US charges include Iran's perceived meddling in Iraq, where the blame for the surge in Shia unrest is laid partly at Tehran's door. It also takes exception to Iran's ambiguous attitude to al-Qaida and Tehran's backing for anti-Israeli groups such as Hizbullah. The recent Kean report on 9/11 detailed unofficial links between some of the al-Qaida hijackers and Iran. </p> <p>Investigations into other terrorist attacks since 9/11, including this year's Madrid bombings and failed plots in Paris and London, point to an Iran connection, though the extent of any government involvement is obscure. </p> <p>While the Bush administration is set on a tougher line there is no consensus even in Washington on what to do. </p> <p>A report by the independent Council on Foreign Relations says since Iran is not likely to implode any time soon, the US should start talking. </p> <p>\"Iran is experiencing a gradual process of internal change,\" the report says. \"The urgency of US concerns about Iran and the region mandate that the US deal with the current regime [through] a compartmentalised process of dialogue, confidence building and incremental engagement.\" </p> <p>That suggestion was mocked by a Wall Street Journal editorial as \"appeasement\". Hawks say the nuclear issue is too urgent to brook further delay. And therein lies the rub. Bringing Iran in from the cold is a time-consuming business. But the Bush administration, as usual, is in a hurry.</p>",
  "<b>Christian Science Monitor</b> <br> Editorial, US, August 9 <p>\"Last Friday, the fighting [in Najaf] was the fiercest in months. Tellingly, this latest violence, which was triggered by the army of the radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, was aimed more at disrupting the interim regime of Prime Minister Ayad Allawi than at ousting US forces. </p> <p>\"This shows the political context for security in post-Saddam Iraq has shifted. The fighting could either rile Iraq's majority Shia or be widely seen as Mr Allawi bringing the kind of security that Iraqis want.</p> <p>\"The international context has also shifted. On Saturday, Nato sent in its first batch of officers to help train Iraqi forces. This adds to the government's legitimacy and widens the coalition for the US. </p> <p>\"And this week, the UN plans to reestablish itself in Iraq with a team that will help prepare for a national political assembly and elections. Such steps bring hope that Iraq can reduce its physical insecurity with increasing political security in the months ahead. For now, the drive for democracy seems rooted in Iraq.\" </p> <p><b>Bahrain Tribune</b><br>Editorial, August 9 </p> <p>\"Faced with the worst outbreak of hostilities in months, Mr Allawi had enacted an amnesty law that supposedly would pardon Iraqis who had committed 'minor crimes'. </p> <p>\"[But] the militants of Mr Sadr do not at all seem to care. Neither is there any word yet that Mr Sadr is ready for a ceasefire. Retaliatory strikes from the US forces in Najaf are only adding weight to the problem.</p> <p>\"Mr Allawi's visit to Najaf [on Sunday] may have its own value and probably sends a good message that he is willing to help fashion out a deal between and among the contending forces in Iraq. An amnesty law can help but probably not for a scenario such as this one.\" </p> <p><b>Gulf News</b><br>Editorial, United Arab Emirates, August 9 </p> <p>\"Many Iraqis, who see themselves as liberation fighters and believe they should rid their country of coalition forces, are confused about whom the amnesty offer is aimed at.</p> <p>\"Although this may be a good gesture by Mr Allawi the complexity of the political scene in Iraq will demand much more than an appeal such as this by a government few Iraqis trust. </p> <p>\"The fact that Iraq has reinstated its suspended capital punishment law only a day after the amnesty was announced illustrates the lack of seriousness of a peaceful appeal to those who are causing havoc in the country.\" </p> <p><b>Arab News</b><br>Editorial, Saudi Arabia, August 9 </p> <p>\"Mr Allawi loves to present himself as a strong man and an efficient crisis manager. [Yet his] political room for manoeuvre is more limited than he would like Mr Sadr is considered a political outsider in the new Iraq. Yet in the times such as the bloody Shia uprising in April and May, his star rises even among the moderate segment of Iraq's 60% majority Shia population. </p> <p>\"That puts pressure on the Shia centre parties, who are prominently represented in the transitional government.</p> <p>\"Mr Allawi has attempted to get around the impending powerlessness of his cabinet with a nearly impossible balancing act. In a press conference on Saturday, he announced to near universal amazement: </p> <p>\"'We believe that the criminals and gangsters in Najaf have nothing to do with Mr Sadr' Mr Allawi called on Mr Sadr himself to enter the political process and take part in the first free elections.\" </p> <p><b>Independent</b><br>Editorial, August 9 </p> <p>\"The violence that has raged in Najaf in recent days is an unfortunate reminder of just how reliant the authority of Iraq's interim government is on US firepower . </p> <p>\"The problem is that every time US forces are deployed, Mr Allawi's government is further discredited in the eyes of much of the population.</p> <p>\"To the Americans, Mr Sadr is still a wanted man and the claims that US forces broke the truce and tried to capture him last week ring true. But Mr Allawi was, by contrast, making conciliatory overtures in Mr Sadr's direction when he made a surprise visit to Najaf.</p> <p>\"There seems to be genuine confusion over whether it would be better to try to do business with Mr Sadr, or to knock him out completely. But trying to do both, as at present, is a dangerous course.\" </p> <p><b>Times</b><br>Editorial, August 9 </p> <p>\"A disturbing element in all this is Iranian intrigue. Few, even in Tehran, would deny that men and material support have been smuggled to Mr Sadr and other factional individuals.</p> <p>\"There are strong reasons to suspect that official [Iranian] involvement is far more substantial than has been admitted. Iraq's neighbours and nations elsewhere, such as Britain, need to be realistic about what is happening and apply the maximum political pressure on the Iranians. </p> <p>\"The al-Sadr revolt would not amount to much were it not for malign external assistance. </p> <p>\"The transfer of political authority in Iraq at the end of June means that this showdown is different from other confrontations. Mr Allawi can speak with a degree of legitimacy. </p> <p>\"He has shown a resolve across a range of issues - from new curfews to the restoration of the death penalty. </p> <p>\"A firm hand is appropriate in these challenging circumstances. It is in the best interests of all Iraqis, notably those in Najaf, that this struggle be won by Baghdad's new government.\"</p>",
  "The long, steep pull out of the great mountain hollow of Engstligenalp leads south-west to the grey, rocky crest of the Ammertengrat in the Bernese Oberland, Switzerland. It was hot work on climbing between boulders and through lush docks and sorrel where the summering heifers were grazing. Going higher into the stony kingdom we crossed old snow and soon we stood on the Ammerten Pass. The chiming of far-away cow bells drifted up to remind us of the hard life of these Oberland farmers; and soon we could see the herd 1,000ft below us on a very steep alp overlooking a thundering torrent. In all these fierce glens there are heaps of stones gathered from the slopes to make better grazing, piled up over the centuries by the native husbandmen, just as in wildest Wales and on St Kilda. <p>Once over the 8,573ft summit of the Ammertenspitze there is that long, airy descent of the north-west arete. The sun warmed the rocks and it was a day to savour nature's architecture around us, the far vistas stretching through blue space to Lenk and beyond. There are good views, too, of Adelboden, a sepia sprawl in a green frame of meadows and conifer woods. </p> <p>There followed that long, sinuous walk along the grassy ridge to Hahnenmoos, strewn at this season with a thousand types of flowering alpine flora; and still we heard the distant tolling of cow bells. A sudden shout from the ridge above brought us back to reality: a model aircraft flier thought his red plane was out of control and heading our way, but it missed us and turned up into the heavens to join a family of alpine choughs cavorting in the summer thermals.</p>",
  "<p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger last night set Patrick Vieira a deadline of this Saturday to resolve his mooted transfer to Real Madrid, or commit his future to Highbury. </p> <p>The Arsenal captain finds the allure of the Bernab\u00e9u compelling, but has been deterred by financial aspects of Madrid's offer. Wenger refuses to allow the unsettling saga to continue into the Premiership season, prompting his comments after the 3-1 Community Shield win over Manchester United yesterday, a match Vieira missed because of a thigh injury. </p> <p>\"My intention is clear: to keep him,\" said Wenger. \"He has given eight fantastic years for the club and has helped build something fantastic, but I want him to be clear in his mind. He can't be half with us and half with someone else. Only he can clarify the situation and he has to do that now. I told him about the potential and I think he believes it. He's got until Saturday to make up his mind. </p> <p>\"The challenge in front of us is hugely difficult and we need a complete focus. I'm not resigned to let the story go on. It has all to be sorted out before the season.\" </p> <p>Even Wenger's Manchester United counterpart Sir Alex Ferguson had a modicum of sympathy for Arsenal. Though David Beckham, who was Madrid's galactico signing last summer, had Ferguson's blessing to leave, the Scot is aware of the Spanish side's transfer-market manoeuvrings. \"They wear you down,\" said Ferguson. \"They go on and on and on. You don't know when it's going to finish.\" </p> <p>Wenger is now trying to take control of a complicated situation. The Spanish radio station, Cadena SER, which has strong links with Real Madrid, reported prematurely last week that Vieira would undoubtedly complete the move. That appears to have been based on an agreement in principle reached over a \u00a323.1m fee for the Frenchman. </p> <p>However, more detailed negotiations with Vieira and his representatives have uncovered disparities between the player's demands and Madrid's offer. The Spanish side's president Florentino P\u00e9rez is prepared only to tender personal terms equivalent to those of the full-back Roberto Carlos, considered a second-tier earner. </p> <p>Such a valuation falls short of Vieira's request for parity with the likes of Ronaldo, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane and Beckham. Although the Frenchman is beguiled by the prospect of donning the white shirt - and knows that, at 28, the opportunity is unlikely to come again - he refuses to be sold short. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Wenger is growing exasperated at his captain's hesitancy and will not wait on his decision forever. \"Patrick's commitment is not in question,\" he said. \"He's always been outstanding in that. But before you start the season you want the captain to be focused on the mind. I don't know, frankly, [what he wants]. I do know what I want and I know what the club wants. </p> <p>\"The club doesn't want the money or want him to go. It's down to him to stay and be focused. He can only do that if he's convinced by that. </p> <p>\"He'll be fit in two or three more weeks. But we have to sort that situation out. There's a big difference between when Real Madrid start the season, in September, than us on Saturday.\" </p> <p>The deadline will inconvenience Vieira, since Madrid will be only at the halfway stage of their Champions League qualification-round against Wisla Krakow. Part of the attraction of a move to the Bernab\u00e9u would be the hope of progressing further in a competition where Arsenal have never reached the semi-final, yet on Saturday Vieira cannot even be sure of Madrid's participation in the tournament. </p> <p>Yesterday's declaration will be as much a message to Real as to the player, since, with three years still to run on his Arsenal contract, Wenger would be able to withdraw the club's financial accord with the Spanish club. </p> <p>\"If Patrick stays he is a player I respect hugely because, every game he has played for me, he's done the maximum. Sometimes [he is] good, sometimes [he is] very good. </p> <p>\"But if he chooses not to stay then we'll have to find different solutions. I'm positive that we can do well, can develop players. We've worked very hard in the last five years to get good young players in and you saw that today.\" </p> <p>Wenger exercised one of his contingencies in Cardiff yesterday, with the 17-year-old Cesc Fabregas manfully partnering Gilberto Silva in central midfield. The Spaniard displayed courage and a precocious ability to read the game, demonstrating that Arsenal's longer-term future remains healthy. </p> <p>United, who are already approaching one of the most important weeks of their season, appeared sidetracked by Tuesday's Champions League qualifier against Dinamo Bucharest.</p>",

  "<p>The journalist and author Bernard Levin has died at the age of 75 after a 50-year career most celebrated for his columns in the Times.</p> <p>Levin, who wrote for the paper between 1971 and 1997, died on Saturday after suffering from Alzheimer's disease for a number of years.</p> <p>In his heyday, he was one of the most listened to voices in the British media, with a profile that straddled print journalism, writing books and broadcasting work on radio and TV. </p> <p>Levin wrote for a large array of different newspapers during his career, including the Manchester Guardian and the Observer.</p> <p>The Guardian took him on in September 1955 to review the first broadcasts of ITV, which had just been launched as Britain's first commercial TV station.</p> <p>He had started his journalistic career at the north American service of the BBC and after that joined the weekly magazine, Truth.</p> <p>Early in his career he worked for the Spectator for a six-year stint as an irreverent parliamentary sketch writer - under the nom de plume, Taper - and was at various times the theatre critic of the Daily Express, the Daily Mail and the Sunday Times.</p> <p>At the Daily Mail in the 1960s, he wrote five 600-word columns a week on top of his theatre reviews.</p> <p>Other publishing credits included Newsweek and the International Herald Tribune, and he had a distinguished broadcasting career, with radio and TV appearances on the BBC and ITV.</p> <p>But the media organisation with which he became most closely identified was the Times, particularly under the editorship of William Rees-Mogg in the 1970s.</p> <p>He was hired by Rees-Mogg in January 1971, by which time he was a well-known public figure who had just written an account of the 1960s entitled The Pendulum Years.</p> <p>Over 26 years - interrupted by a self-imposed break when Harold Evans became editor in 1981 - he contributed over 2,000 Times opinion pieces that often set the tone of national debate.</p> <p>In 1990, Levin's denunciation of the Singaporean prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, prompted that country's government to take out a full-page advertisement in a rival paper in response.</p> <p>His last column, in which he mounted a sterling defence of smokers, was published in November 1997, and he continued to write occasionally for the paper after that.</p> <p>Levin's style was noted for its long sentences with copious sub-clauses and regular use of semi-colons - he once managed a 1,500-word sentence.</p> <p>Born in London into a Jewish family of Lithuanian extraction in 1928, Levin was educated at Christ's Hospital and the London School of Economics, where he later became an honorary fellow.</p> <p>Although he never married, he had a number of relationships, including a noted liaison in the 1970s with the author and heiress, Arianna Stassinopoulous, who as Arianna Huffington is now a US Republican politician. </p> <p>Levin was once punched on live television while appearing on the satirical programme, That Was The Week That Was.</p> <p>After a vitriolic review of a play starring the actress and singer, Agnes Bernelle, her husband Desmond Leslie came to the studio and hit Levin in front of 11 million viewers.</p> <p>Tributes were led today by Robert Thomson, editor of The Times.</p> <p>\"Bernard Levin was one of the most gifted and influential columnists to write for The Times. The beauty of his language and originality of his thought ensured that he had an enthusiastic audience far beyond the borders of Britain.\" </p> <p>Simon Jenkins, the former Times editor, told the paper's online edition: \"He always said to me: 'If in doubt, attack', which is at odds with the usual adage of journalism, 'if in doubt, leave it out'.</p> <p>\"What is significant is that he came, not from a news or reporting background, but from theatre criticism. His stock in trade was opinion.</p> <p>\"His pieces could be absolutely savage in their attacks, on bankers, lawyers, dictators, anti-Semites. He absolutely detested Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore. He tended to champion freedom and oppose dictatorships. </p> <p>\"These may seem easy targets, but his writing was always fresh and they never seemed easy.</p> <p>\"He also hated bad food and bad opera. But some of his best writing was enthusiastic. He wrote wonderfully about music, and could write an entire column about a good dinner.</p> <p>\"To see Bernard surrounded by his old friends, to notice that actually the acerbity of his profession as a columnist was mellowed by the very close bonds of friendship, was to realise that he was a very shy man who communicated with the world through his pen rather than in any other way.\"</p> <p>Levin is survived by his partner, Liz Anderson. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>British Airways more than doubled fuel surcharges on its long haul flights today to reflect the surge in oil prices that are expected to add \u00a3225m to fuel costs this year.</p> <p>From Wednesday, the surcharge will increase from \u00a32.50 to \u00a36 for single trips, and to \u00a312 for return trips. The short haul surcharge of \u00a32.50 remains unchanged. </p> <p>\"Fuel prices have risen by 45% in the last 12 months and our fuel costs are expected to be \u00a3225m higher than last year,\" said John Rishton, BA's chief financial officer. \"We anticipate that the combined fuel surcharges will contribute \u00a370m toward these costs.\" </p> <p>Passengers have been paying surcharges on air fares since May, when carriers introduced the charges as a temporary measure to cope with soaring costs since the war in Iraq. Other airlines are considering similar increases in ticket prices. Britain's second biggest long-haul carrier, Virgin Atlantic, said its surcharge was \"under review\". </p> <p>But discount airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair, currently in the grip of a price war, have so far resisted imposing a fuel levy.</p> <p>The increase in BA's fuel surcharges came as the carrier announced pre-tax profits of \u00a3115m for the first quarter of its financial year, up from losses of \u00a345m a year earlier. The result was higher than a consensus forecast of \u00a3104m, with estimates ranging from \u00a387m to \u00a3131m. </p> <p>BA took a loss in the same period last year as ticket sales were hit by the Iraq war, the Sars virus and sluggish economies around the world. Rod Eddington, the chief executive, said the carrier's biggest challenge was fuel and employee costs. </p> <p>The airline faces a \u00a3133m increase in pension contributions per year and potential strike action from baggage handlers and check-in staff over pay. It said market conditions remained unchanged and reiterated its forecast of a 2-3% increase in revenue in the current year to March 2005. First-quarter revenue rose 5.1% to \u00a31.9bn. </p> <p>Martin Broughton, BA's new chairman, said: \"Long haul premium volumes are recovering steadily, while short haul premium travel remains at lower levels. The non-premium markets are very price sensitive.\"</p> <p>Unions stepped up their demands for a bigger pay rise following BA's first quarter results, pointing out that \u00a370m was needed over three years to settle the current pay claims.</p> <p>\"These profits have been achieved with the significant efforts of the workforce,\" Brendan Gold, the national officer of the TGWU, said. </p> <p>\"Now is the time for the BA board to stop insulting them and agree to their modest and reasonable claim to secure the future.\" </p> <p>In a separate development, BA said it had lodged a protest with the European commission over pressure from Italy for it to stop offering lower fares on flights that compete with Alitalia. </p> <p>BA wrote to the commission after the Italian government demanded, late last week, that it and other leading European carriers stop undercutting the struggling state-controlled Italian carrier. </p> <p>\"It is really between governments to negotiate on air service agreements. We are perfectly within our rights,\" a BA spokeswoman told Reuters. </p> <p>The commission said it had written to all EU member states to gather more evidence and establish whether it needed to take action at EU level following the complaint. </p> <p>The Italian government has shored up Alitalia with an emergency state-guaranteed \u20ac400m (\u00a3266.5m) loan, prompting BA to ask the commission to reject the loan last month.</p>",
  "<p>Barclays have announced a new \u00a357m three-year sponsorship of the Premiership, which will now be called the Barclays Premiership.</p> <p>The banking company has also committed an additional \u00a330m to assist sports at the grass-roots level with building facilities, kits and equipment. </p> <p>The investment scheme - to be labelled 'Spaces for Sport' - is thought to be the biggest single injection of cash into the base-level of sports in the United Kingdom. But it was the continuation of Barclays' association with the Premiership that dominated a glitzy reception in London this afternoon.</p> <p>Football personalities like Gordon Strachan and League Managers Association official Frank Clark were on hand to hear Premiership chief executive Richard Scudamore announce the launch. </p> <p>The fans may not easily discern the difference as Barclaycard have been the Premiership's sponsors over the last three years. But the rebranding with the parent company's name up front is believed to be a device to carry the competition's name to a more global audience. </p> <p> Scudamore believes the Premiership, which kicks off on Saturday, now has the pulling power to take a more hands-on role in the broadcasting of matches abroad, which will generate increased income. </p> <p>A notable absentee at the launch was Premiership chairman Dave Richards, no doubt heavily involved in his other role as Football Association councillor. </p> <p>The Premiership launch took place on the same day the FA started a two-day meeting to sort out their recent problems. A massive restructuring process is on the cards at Soho Square where control of the game will be handed over to professional administrators rather than the county representatives currently in power.</p> <p>But Scudamore, who has been tipped as a possible successor to departed FA chief executive Mark Palios refused to comment on such speculation. </p> <p>He said: \"I'm just looking forward to a great new campaign. Questions about the FA? I won't even go there.\" </p> <p>And the man who has been the league's No1 administrator for six years, said: \"You just feel the season is about to get under way now when we have a situation like this announcing the Premiership's new sponsors. Too soon?

  "<p>When I had a baby eight months ago, I had never heard of thiomersal. Most new parents I met had never heard of it either. But today the government has quietly removed it from babies' vaccinations and we ought to wonder why.</p> <p>The Department of Health announced the change as part of a new vaccination to be given to babies at two, three and four months old. From late next month, a five-in-one injection against polio, Hib, diptheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) will replace the current four-in-one plus oral live polio. </p> <p>While the government highlights that the new polio vaccine will be inactive, thus eliminating the small risk of transmitting polio that live vaccine carries, it was the DTP element that caught my attention. </p> <p>The DTP vaccine that has been in use for the last 60 years incorporates a preservative called thiomersal, made up of about 50% mercury. Some researchers have found a link with autism and other disorders. Indeed, there is more evidence linking thiomersal to autism than there is linking MMR to autism. MMR, by the way, is mercury-free. </p> <p>Unlike MMR, which is given at just over a year old, DTP hits parents at a very vulnerable time, when their baby is just two months old. Most have barely figured out how the recline feature on their buggy works at this point, not to mention the breast pump, sterilisation, the car seat (little wonder so many are fitted incorrectly), the bouncy chair and the most effective patting technique to produce a burp. </p> <p>On top of this, you are expected to assess if the first round of injections your baby receives will leave him or her with neurological damage. After consulting the NHS, medical journals and reams of journalism on the subject, my husband and I decided there were enough studies questioning the safety of thiomersal to make us seek an alternative. </p> <p>We found that Australia and the US had already begun using thiomersal-free vaccines for children, and that in Scotland parents were given the option of a non-mercury DTP injection. When I asked my GP at the baby's standard six-week check, he told me that thiomersal had been in vaccines for decades and there was no proven health risk. </p> <p>He had nothing to say I had not already heard from the NHS, and I was still not convinced, so I asked if he could offer an alternative. The surgery had only what the Department of Health supplied, he said, and if I wanted anything different, I would need to go private. </p> <p>The GP would not suggest a private clinic, but, through friends and the internet, I found an NHS surgery in central London that offered Infanrix, the brand name for the non-mercury DTP offered to parents in Scotland. Not only did it avoid the whole mercury issue, but, because it was a partial cell vaccine rather than whole cell, it had fewer potential side effects. It was also slightly less effective in protecting against whooping cough but, on balance of risks, I still felt better about DTaP. </p> <p>It was not going to come cheap: \u00a375 per shot, and the baby needed three rounds, at two, three and four months old. When I left the clinic with a grouchy baby after getting the first shot, the peace of mind was worth every penny. </p> <p>I hopped on a bus back to my GP's surgery so that he could have the other vaccines scheduled for the day: Hib, meningitis C and oral polio. I informed the nurse that he would not need DTwP, as we had just had DTaP.</p> <p>\"Is this what you mean?\" she asked, holding up a vial of Infanrix that I had paid \u00a375 for just hours earlier.</p> <p>Apparently, a non-mercury alternative to DTwP has been sitting in every GP's vaccine stock for some time now, as Infanrix is the DoH standard for pre-schoolers' booster shots of DTP. It is approved for use in the UK from two months old. But it is entirely up to your GP's surgery whether they let your baby have it then, and mine would not.</p> <p>I thought the vaccine might simply cost more, so I offered to pay my GP's office to give the baby Infanrix. They still refused.</p> <p>That refusal forced the baby to have three extra shots, which I can tell you he did not like one bit, and cost us \u00a3225. They justified the decision only by saying they would not swerve from the approved DoH schedule of vaccinations. </p> <p>Of course if we had not had the money but felt just as strongly, they would have kept the baby from being vaccinated at all. (Some would argue that this is the way to go, anyway. I don't agree.)</p> <p>I was made to feel like my objections were completely illogical, a result of reading too many scare stories on the internet. </p> <p>I am not here to tell you that thiomersal causes autism. I have no idea if that is true. I can tell you that some very sound studies say it might and similarly sound studies say it does not. I did not feel personally qualified to make the call and wanted to err on the side of caution.</p> <p>That is precisely what the DoH seems to think, as well. As they put it, the change \"meets the internationally agreed aim of reducing the exposure of children to mercury if it can be avoided\". Because the government is not - really, when pressed - absolutely sure that injecting two-month-old babies with mercury was such a good idea after all.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Not content with depriving the nation of the inestimable pleasure of running their thumbnails down the foil-covered grooves of a Kit Kat, Nestl\u00e9 Rowntree (why, you're not fit to hold a guttering candle to Cadbury Schweppes! Yes, and I mean it to hurt!) are reportedly dropping their \"Have a break, have a Kit Kat\" slogan. Yes, after 50 years of sterling service, the well-loved phrase which so entices as it comforts with its soothing familiarity is to be replaced by \"Make the most of your break.\" </p> <p>I have a slogan for Nestl\u00e9: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I would like to orchestrate a countrywide protest again this interloper, this further mindless chipping away of our confectionery heritage, as if childhood chocolatey associations were not some of the sweetest gewgaws we hold in the treasure chest of memory. As if, in short, they mattered not. </p> <p>Apparently, marketing managers found that although 90% of the population could recite the slogan, it didn't actually make them go out and buy any more Kit Kats. So if you live near a newsagents, take care on the streets later in September when \"Make the most of your break\" is unleashed, lest you be trampled by the ravening hordes, the tidal wave of humanity suddenly possessed by the insatiable need for a four-fingered wafer biscuit and prepared to trample unwitting pedestrians in the rush to secure their fix. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Speaking of chipping away at our heritage, the Alternative Census has just published its results, which show that the British high street is being denuded of all those old-fashioned shops like greengrocers, bakeries and hardware shops and that they are being replaced by aromatherapists and image consultants. So, instead of a bunch of shops you might actually use on a daily basis and which might save you the endless bus trips to and from the supermarket, with its stroke-inducing strip lighting and quotient of caterwauling anklebiters, we are being surrounded by the 21st century's equivalent of shamans, charlatans and alchemists. </p> <p>Apparently, the number of aromotherapists rose by 5,200%, cosmetic surgery by 1,780% and dieting and weight control agencies by 1,445%. But the saddest news of all is perhaps the announcement that number of coppersmiths has fallen by 35%. That's not what I call progress. </p> <p>Oh well, fashions change, and if I can just hang around long enough, I'm sure I'll see my perfect high street come into favour - the butcher, baker and candlestick maker down one side, and secondhand bookshops alternating with George Clooney memorabilia boutiques up the other. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> A Frenchwoman is in beaucoup de trouble avec her bosses, who have taken exception to her writing a book describing how to get along in the Gallic corporate world without doing any work. Corinne Maier's ever-so-faintly satirical livre, which does not mention her employers by name, is called \"Bonjour Paresse\" (\"Hello Laziness\") and contains such edifying chapters as: </p> <p>The Morons Who Are Sitting Next to You </p> <p>Business Culture, My Arse </p> <p>Why You Can't Lose By Resigning </p> <p>and of course the impressively succinct Corporate Culture - Stupid People. </p> <p>La Maier recommends becoming a consultant, expert or adviser as the best way of minimising one's workload, and advises carrying a big bundle of files under your arm at all times to act as a prophylactic against those taskmasters who would importune you for more arduous labours. </p> <p>Unfortunately, her employers at the EDF (the French state-owned electricity board, where she works as an economic - er - adviser) have suffered such a severe sense-of-humour failure (an event not entirely without historical precedent among both bosses and the French) that they are summoning her to a disciplinary hearing. It's possible the book rankles more than it might otherwise have done because it's being published at a time when the EDF is facing an unwanted partial privatisation, to increase its efficiency. Quel dommage, mes pauvres petites. But I'm sure it will all come out in le wash.</p>",
  "Three police stations a month have closed since Tony Blair came to power, the Liberal Democrats revealed today. <p>New figures the party has obtained from the Home Office show that 227 stations shut since 1997 in England and Wales, with Essex alone losing 59.</p> <p>The statistics will provide ammunition for a high-profile speech on crime the Conservative leader, Michael Howard, is planning to give tomorrow in Middlesbrough.</p> <p>However, the numbers also show that closures ran at an even higher rate when Mr Howard was home secretary in the early 1990s: stations were shutting at the rate of one a week when the Tory leader presided over the Home Office during the four years to May 1997.</p> <p>In all, 536 stations have been lost since 1992 as officers and resources have been concentrated in larger stations, often in town centres, according to the previously secret official study. Since 1997, Essex has been hardest hit, with 59 closures, followed by Gloucestershire, with 23, and south Wales, with 22. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, who made the figures public, said the government was letting people down. </p> <p>\"Many of these closures have been in the name of efficiency and cost cutting,\" he said. \"Thousands of people no longer have a permanent police presence in their town or neighbourhood. </p> <p>\"Community policing is vital for cutting crime and maintaining public confidence. At a time when the government claims the public should have a bigger say in local policing, people are increasingly unable to go down to the station and talk to an officer in person. </p> <p>\"Police stations are a precious resource and the government has let people down by failing to protect them.\" </p> <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, said: \"People want to see police out on the street and they also want to know there is a local police station they can go to.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Home Office responded: \"Police station numbers have reduced in the past 10 years to take out inadequate and little utilised premises in favour of modern facilities. These are located in areas of greatest policing pressure.\"</p> <p>Mr Howard's speech tomorrow is timed to try to wrestle the initiative on crime back from the government, which announced extra billions of pounds for law and order and more than 20,000 more community support officers in last month's spending review. </p> <p>The Tory leader is expected to blame Britain's crime rate in part on a lack of personal responsibility and an absence of father figures. </p> <p>He is due to say: \"Many people now believe that they are no longer wholly responsible for their actions; it is someone else's or something else's fault: the environment, the government, society.</p> <p>\"Children, especially boys, benefit hugely from a male influence. Of course, this isn't always possible because a large number of men simply abandon their responsibilities as fathers.</p> <p>\"But there are many fathers in Britain today who do want to play their part yet can't get access to their children.\"</p> <p>The Tories have already pledged to change the law so there is a legal presumption that both parents have an equal right to be involved in their children's upbringing.</p>",

  "The US election is, as they promised, getting very dirty. Karl Rove (Bush's Svengali) is said to have predicted, \"By November, they won't even know whose side he fought on.\" \"He\", of course, is John Kerry - the would-be next president of America whose Svengalis (less gifted in the black arts than Rove) chose to package him as Lieutenant John, intrepid Swift Boat skipper, acknowledging the ovation of the delegates with a military salute and a crisp \"reporting for duty\". <p>Shortly afterwards, the other side hoisted (yet again) the national-security level to orange and releasing their propaganda torpedo. The Democrats can count on the sell-out movie (Fahrenheit 9/11); the Republicans, a book (Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry) that is already No 1 on Amazon's bestseller list a week before publication. </p> <p>Regnery, the publishing house under whose imprint Unfit for Command appears, is part of the Eagle corporation. Their proud mission is \"to provide independent thinkers with perspective and solutions favoring the traditional American values of free enterprise, limited government, and individual liberty\". Books, that is, like Wayne LaPierre's Guns, Crime and Freedom (LaPierre is executive vice-president and chief executive officer of the National Rifle Association). </p> <p>The reading public must wait for their copies of Unfit for Command. Its contents are strictly embargoed until August 15. Such embargoes are routinely flouted in the UK but not in America, where the courts have upheld them. Not to worry, however: web sleazemeister Matt Drudge declared, last Tuesday, \"I shall break the embargo.\" Which, over the next few days, he did. </p> <p>Two of Kerry's three Purple Hearts, Regnery's Swiftvets allege, were from \"self-inflicted wounds\" (a serious military crime). None had required \"an hour's hospitalisation\". Kerry's bronze star was for a wound in the \"fanny\" (as he was running away, one presumes). His Silver Star (one of the highest decorations for gallantry) was for shooting (why mince words? Murdering) a fleeing unarmed teenager dressed only in a loincloth. Forget presidential aspirations; on this evidence, John Kerry should be standing alongside Lynndie England at Fort Bragg, facing court martial. </p> <p>Drudge is a trusted mouthpiece of the right. Given his record, one may suspect that he was fed the Swiftvet stuff by Regnery with the acquiescence of the far-right political interests that finance the Eagle publishing operation. If this is the case, Drudge is not \"breaking the embargo\". He is point man in the shit-blitz designed to counter the serious damage inflicted by Michael Moore. </p> <p>The advantage of a strategic release of the poisonous allegations while unsympathetic commentators remain muzzled by embargo restriction is obvious - the supporting evidence and the credibility of the witnesses cannot be queried. Many Vietnam veterans apparently despise Kerry for throwing away his medals, growing his hair long and hanging out with Jane Fonda while they were still getting their backsides shot off on the front line. The fact that this \"hero\" was only four months in active service (relieved of his command for recklessness, the Swiftvets allege) does not help. </p> <p>Basic web sleuthing soon revealed that senior ex-officers among the Swiftvets are aligned with the campaign to re-elect Bush. Drudge concedes that a mysterious \"donor in Texas\" has financed their book and the TV ad in which they brand Kerry a liar (the advertisement can be found at <a href=\"http://www.swiftvets.com\">www.swiftvets.com</a>: a website, one suspects, not paid for by the veterans' military pensions). </p> <p>It's Godzilla versus King Kong fighting it out in the cesspit of US politics. If you believe Michael Moore's film, Bush was in cahoots with the Bin Laden clan. If you believe the Swiftvets' book, the man who wants to replace Bush is a poltroon - incapable of commanding a small plastic boat, let alone the most powerful nation on the planet as it faces the greatest crisis in its history. As usual in politics everywhere, it will come down to who is telling the truest lies.</p>",
  "Unswerving defender of Fidel Castro and Latin American literary patriarch he may be, but Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez appears to have finally succumbed to Hollywood's call, signing over the film rights to Love in the Time of Cholera. <p>The Los Angeles production company Stone Village Pictures is reportedly paying the Colombian Nobel laureate between one and three million dollars to make a movie of what producer Scot Steindorff recently termed \"the best love story ever told, next to Romeo and Juliet\". </p> <p>Despite selling millions of books around the globe, the 76-year-old novelist, who is battling with cancer, is said to be worried about the financial future of his lifetime partner Mercedes and their two sons Gonzalo and Rodrigo. </p> <p>Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, who has lived in Mexico most of the time since 1961, reportedly sank substantial sums into a news magazine called Cambio that he started in Colombia before launching a Mexican version with mixed results. </p> <p>Born in Colombia in 1928, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez spent years as a struggling journalist before making his name crafting fantastic tales told with breathtaking naturalness, often inspired by the lives of his own family and the turbulent history of his native country and continent. </p> <p>He shot to international literary fame with his 1967 novel One Hundred Years of Solitude, loosely based on the experiences of his own grandparents. In his recent autobiography Bill Clinton described the book as \"the greatest novel in any language since William Faulkner died\". </p> <p>Love in the Time of Cholera, published in 1985, follows the struggles of Florentina Ariza to win the heart of Fermina Daza. It takes the hero 51 years, nine months and four days, but he wins her in the end. </p> <p>The Colombian newspaper El Espectador quoted a triumphant Steindorff as saying it took him two years of constant badgering to persuade the novelist to agree to sell the rights. </p> <p>\"Like the main character in the book I persevered and never lost hope until I achieved my goal. We are going to work very hard to make the most beautiful film Hollywood has ever made.\" </p> <p>The project is an apparent about-turn for Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, a veteran defender of Latin American independence under pressure from successive US regimes intent on imposing their political priorities and cultural trends on the whole hemisphere. </p> <p>The novelist has remained fiercely loyal to Fidel Castro, even after many others on the left distanced themselves from the Cuban leader because of his apparently indiscriminate crackdown on dissidents and political use of the death penalty. Last year this issue drew Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez into a bitter polemic with Susan Sontag, who publicly lambasted the author for not criticizing his old friend. </p> <p>Up to now Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez has always resisted the temptation to allow high-budget English language films of his work. The most commercial adaptation of his books to hit the screen so far was the 1987 Italian version of Chronicle of a Death Foretold, directed by Francesco Rosi and starring Rupert Everett. </p> <p>Details of who may direct or star in the movie have yet to be released, although the names of Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are already circulating. Steindorff himself has reportedly hinted that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez could be persuaded to write the screenplay.</p>",

  "<p>I hope enough time has passed now for those who participated to look back with fondness. Charles Brand, of Tiger Aspect, who chaired the panel judging the channel of the year awards for 2004, should by now have completed the resulting therapy and may, God willing, eventually be able to participate in a gentle debate about television somewhere down the line. </p> <p>It should be stated clearly and on the record that the descent into shouty chaos was not Brand's fault. The jury's frustration with the judging process resulted from the lacklustre performance of the shortlist, not the hospitality offered by Tiger Aspect. Brand was only working with the tools available. And I say this as one who banged on the table shouting, \"I can't believe we're deciding between [bleep] and [bleep].\" </p> <p>All agreed that it hadn't been a stand-out year for any of the shortlisted channels (all the terrestrial channels are considered and the multichannel shortlist consisted of Sky One, Sky News, ITV2, BBC3, BBC4 and Living TV) and in those circumstances there's never an easy consensus. None the less, it is staggering how much one hit show can change a channel's image. 24 alone almost won the prize for Sky One, despite its tiny ratings. Similarly, in PR terms, Curb Your Enthusiasm must be the best buy BBC4 ever made and the fact that it's been poached by E4 may deeply depress its peer approval rating. </p> <p>Some things I have learned and can share for the general good of television include: ITV2 is \"like a website for ITV\" - it may be one of the fastest growing digital channels but few people love it; BBC4 \"was set up not to get an audience and it's doing it very well\"; Living TV is the channel most likely to provoke a screaming row - panellists either loved it wholeheartedly and confessed their guilty enjoyment of a good TV seance or loathed it with an excoriating contempt (actually these two groups didn't disagree about Living TV being mindless trash, it's just that one group believes that to be a good thing). </p> <p>The panel itself (Matthew Freud, Rhona Cameron, Boyd Hilton, Charlie Parsons, David Docherty, Catherine Tate, Anthony Fry, Dave Rowntree, Josie D'Arby and Shazia Mirza) displayed something of a bias in favour of female comedians of a certain generation, so it was perhaps unsurprising that BBC3's ability to commission comedy from new performers was vehemently applauded. And maybe that's right, on the grounds that no one else in the multichannel world is yet doing likewise. Freud - and I make no apologies here for blowing his anonymity - was patently asking for trouble and trying to subvert the process by nominating Sky plus, which is not a TV channel, commissions no programmes, has no budget and is owned by his father in law. It was around this point that the good order of the proceedings began to crumble. His later attempt to shoehorn bid-up tv into the proceedings was, I'm sure, the moment Charles Brand first contemplated tranquillisers. </p> <p>The terrestrial channel of the year debate was shockingly straightforward. Perhaps by then the panel was spent. Other than some bickering over which channel should be most feted for commissioning Paul Abbott (it was something of a relief that Freud didn't propose giving the award to Abbott's computer) and a mini drama about whether Channel 4 is a work of genius from start to finish or an utter betrayal of the principles of public service broadcasting, it was all a bit good-natured. </p> <p>Why then, if it's so difficult to reach a consensus, does the channel of the year award matter? Well, actually, beneath all the bickering and the messing around, there was a very serious intent. Part of the difficulty for the judges was their own sense of the very high standards that broadcasters should be achieving to be worthy of such a sobriquet. To call yourself channel of the year, following in the footsteps of a triumphant Channel Five or BBC2 or MTV on the top of their game, is a very big deal. And when we talked about each of the channels in turn I think even the worst naysayers felt there was plenty to be impressed by. </p> <p>The organisers tell me that having digital refuseniks on the panel is the right thing - those judges were better able to make dispassionate assessments of impact and contribution to the general ecology of television. And it's true that out of the oddness of the deliberations and the madness of the debate, our chair manfully led us to a decision in which the right channels probably won (we still don't know as the final decision is made by secret ballot). </p> <p>But the moment I'll treasure was when one panellist gave vent in a glorious rant about one channel controller. </p> <p>The vote had been taken, the die cast, and it certainly had no effect on the result but it revealed one brilliant truth: when it comes to television, it comes down to what you like. </p> <p>Get well soon, Charles.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The winners of the channel of the year awards will be announced by Bob Mortimer at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival on Saturday 28 August. <a href=\"http://www.mgeitf.co.uk\">www.mgeitf.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Unless you were a teenager in the 1980s, you might struggle to place the name Christian Slater. \"Was he in Empire of the Sun?\" a friend asks when I mention I'm meeting him. No, that was Christian Bale. \"Was he the one in the band?\" No, that was Keanu Reeves. Among the Hollywood brat pack of the late 1980s, Slater was the sarky one in leathers, bad boy to Ethan Hawke's grunge angel and, like Hawke, he is at present attempting a comeback. I fly to the Isle of Man to meet him, where he is filming his first title role in ages - a bizarre spoof called Churchill: The Hollywood Years, written by the old Comedy Store team and co-starring Rik Mayall, Leslie Phillips, Vic Reeves, Bob Mortimer and Harry Enfield. His PR minder says, \"It must be weird for Christian; he's been out of work for a while,\" before hastily remembering herself: \"Well, not out of work exactly.\" </p> <p>The scene they are shooting when we arrive is in the Castletown British Legion building in the middle of a housing estate. Outside, huge white sheets billow on washing lines while inside Slater performs in second-world-war dress as the young Churchill. He catches my eye and gives me a cheesy wink of a kind I haven't received since meeting Darren Day. The last memorable film role Slater played was 11 years ago, opposite Patricia Arquette in True Romance, but he is best remembered for his kooky roles in films such as Heathers, with Winona Ryder, skateboard flick Gleaming the Cube and Young Guns II. As his star faded in the 1990s, he took the traditional route of drugs, booze and jail and is now an evangelist for fatherhood and jogging. </p> <p>Still, a vague lustre clings to Slater, probably derived poignancy. During a break in filming Leslie Phillips wanders over, camel overcoat balanced on his shoulders. \"He's very sure of himself,\" he says, smilingly. \"They all are at that level. He'll feel like a god, coming to this little nook. It's a different league - like Manchester United and Sunderland.\" I ask if he's obnoxious. \"Not obnoxious, no, he's too professional for that. But if something isn't right for him, he presses a button and his agent deals with it. They [Hollywood stars] are not like us at all. They play it for real.\" </p> <p>\"All riiiight!\" whoops Slater when I enter his trailer. Pictures of his wife, Ryan, and two kids adorn the walls. I still have an image of him as a 17-year-old poster-boy and against this airbrushed memory, he has aged tremendously. He is only 34, but the sarcasm that made him so cool back then seems to have hardened around his eyes and sits uncomfortably with his fanatical cheerfulness. \"It's really been, uh, a great experience,\" he says of the film. \"You know, Vic and Bob. And Harry Enfield. It's just, yeah, hilarious, very funny, and Leslie is great. It's really been amazing and all so\" - his gaze wanders out of window - \"and the people so unique and special and hilarious.\" </p> <p>It seems a strange role for him, very British in its humour and, on the page at least, killingly unfunny. \"I don't know, it's, uh, you know, when I first read it, I wasn't really sure what to make of it, but somehow I must have convinced Peter [writer and director, Peter Richardson] because he was under the impression that I totally understood it. Really, the whole thing is a take on English aristocracy and American heroics and patriotism and it blends them nicely. My character is so all-American, gung-ho, rah-rah. I mean, it's crazy, you know, Winston Churchill was a 60-year-old man at this time and he was not the most robust character, so to do what they've done in this movie is funny and different and weird. And quirky. That's really what it is.\" </p> <p>There is a knock on the door and the director pops in to lend Slater another Comedy Store video, to help him understand the genre. \"Rik's very funny in it,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Oh, cool,\" says Slater. \"Oh, great. Are you in this as well? Or no?\" There is an awkward pause. \"Is that you there?\" He points to the video sleeve. \"No,\" says Richardson, \"that's Adrian [Edmondson].\" </p> <p>\"OK, OK,\" says Slater, \"I just wanted to know. Excellent, excellent.\" </p> <p>When Richardson's gone, he says, \"He's adorable. I can't think of anything else I would rather be doing right now, other than maybe being home.\" He allows himself a rueful smile. \"But I've been home a lot.\" </p> <p>Slater's career started in his mid-teens and he says that he still, at times, feels 16. He is beautifully vague about his lost years, which he calls his \"experiences\". In 1997 he was jailed for three months after a drunken fight with his wife and for two years he fought off drug addiction. With touching modesty, he slogged his way back to relative prominence via small roles in films, some of them so small as to be uncredited, such as Easily Fooled Security Guard in Austin Powers and Crew Guy No 1 in a film called Masked and Anonymous. </p> <p>\"John Cougar Mellencamp says hold on to 16 as long as you can, cos changes come around real soon, make us women and men.\" He laughs. \"You just have to roll with it. The last few years I took some time to, you know, just step back a little bit from the business and concentrate on the family and kids. I was doing little things in movies and it all worked out very nicely.\" </p> <p>Does he regret starting his career so young? \"You get very confused. I certainly got ... confused. Hit some walls and, you know, gone through my fair share of\" - he snaps on the cold, sarcastic voice - \" ups and downs . But it's been great too. You know.\" He struggles, then says very seriously, as if addressing a meeting, \"I'm glad to be here today.\" </p> <p>When he was jailed, did he lose friends? \"Well I, I didn't really lose friends. It was like a two-year period when I went off the deep end and it culminated in that ludicrous mess. I was lying in bed last night thinking about it, and I realised, I should have just gone on [US chat show] Jay Leno. Like, you know, I could've just talked it out, why didn't I do that? But I chose to lay low, take it easy, get some help, regroup. I didn't want that to be the only part of my life I talked about.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, it is the part of his life most enthusiastically returned to in interviews, which accounts for Slater's attitude. </p> <p>\"I was doing an interview for the BBC and for some reason they had me and Kiefer Sutherland sitting together and they were, like, 'It's the Young Guns 2 reunion!' And they were talking to Kiefer, he'd just won the Golden Globe, and they talked about all the great things he'd done in the last six years. And then the journalist looked at me, right in the last 10 seconds of the interview, and it was horrible. He goes, 'What have you been doing, Christian? You ... you've been to prison!' \" He laughs bitterly. \"It was like, you fucker. You know? I was totally slapped in the face. I just joked it off. But it gave me a moment to think: well, what have I been doing in the last six years? I've gotten married, I've had two kids; I've taken karate classes, I've run a marathon.\" These are the props of rehab, a stable timetable and worthwhile, mind and body-engaging activities. Slater also went back to school and took his high-school diploma, which he felt he ought to do if he wanted to lecture his children about the value of education. \"It makes it easier for me to face people,\" he says. </p> <p>Does he look back on the 80s with nostalgia or despair? \"Ah, the 80s. I was watching MTV the other day - it sounds like I'm watching a lot of TV - they had a commercial with these two guys in a grocery cart and one of them was like, 'We're gleaming the cube, man!' That made me laugh. I thought, well, Jesus, that's an interesting place to be where people are using titles of films that you've done in a humorous way. It's kind of adorable.\" But he sounds dejected. </p> <p>Soon after we met, Slater was in the papers again after his wife allegedly broke a glass over his head during a violent spat. They were rumoured to have split up, then reconciled. He is in Britain now, appearing as the lead in a stage production of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I speak to him briefly on the phone; he has chickenpox and sounds miserable. Yes, he says, the stage role is \"wonderful and interesting\". And Churchill: The Hollywood Years, which hasn't yet been released, turned out \"very cute, very sweet. Adorable.\" I ask if he is being sarcastic. \"No,\" he says. \"I thought it was charming.\" </p> <p>Have he and his wife split up? \"We had a public, tabloidy, exaggerated story that was misconstrued. We're definitely still in love. It was not a big deal. They need to fill their papers and I'm happy to provide.\" There is an icy pause. I ask if there is anything else he wants to say. \"I love life,\" he says. \"I love to act. I love to have a good time.\" Right. \"See ya, darlin',\" he says, and I put down the phone feeling depressed.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest will start at the Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh, when Christian Slater has recovered from his illness.

Shearer, being a peaceable soul, has almost certainly forgiven and forgotten. </p> <p><strong>Trivial pursuits:</strong> As if Mourinho wasn't under enough pressure, he has a ready-made replacement in Mateja Kezman, whose managerial acumen was proved by guiding Leyton Orient into the First Division on Championship Manager. </p> <p><strong>Sky's title sequence to include:</strong> Celestine Babayaro's goal-celebration backflip could make a comeback.

At Porto, sometimes he played with four in a diamond in midfield; sometimes he selected three in the middle and three in attack.

  "<p>A-level A grades could be split into four to help the most prestigious universities select candidates under proposals from the government's exams troubleshooter.</p> <p>But universities said today the change would only really help if and when they move to a system where students apply after their A-level and Highers results, instead of on the present basis of predicted grades.</p> <p>The number of students with three or more A grades rose to around 20,000 in 2002, about 2.5% of the age group. Mike Tomlinson, the former chief inspector of schools who is heading an inquiry into the reform of the 14 to 19 curriculum, has made it clear he is pushing for radical reform rather than just tinkering.</p> <p>However this piecemeal change would ease the pressure on the most oversubscribed universities who have introduced their own tests in popular subjects like medicine and law because they are deluged with applications from students who are predicted to get As at A-level. Oxbridge and some other Russell group institutions will be running biomedical and law tests this year for 2005 applicants.</p> <p>\"Differentiating the top grades is one of the biggest issues we face, with the large numbers now getting them,\" Mr Tomlinson was reported to have told the Sunday Times.</p> <p>He added: \"We are looking at the possibility of having the results of people at A grade telling them whether they are in the top quartile, second, third or bottom quartile. That would give a degree of differentiation. The marked range covering A grade is very considerable.\"</p> <p>But Ken Boston, chief executive of the exams watchdog for England, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, poured cold water on the idea and said universities could make better use of the information already available. For instance, universities could look at the grades for each module, he told a teachers' conference earlier this year. \"In OCR English literature in 2002, for example, 26.5% of candidates were awarded A grades. Only 6.2% obtained the equivalent of a grade A in each of the six units,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Boston also suggested releasing candidates' marks to universities along with the grades as a way of helping them differentiate between applicants.</p> <p>Delyth [correct] Chambers, director of admissions at Birmingham University, said today that marks could be too crude to distinguish between candidates and said Mr Tomlinson's quartiles proposal might represent a good compromise. But she added: \"At what point would this information become available? In the current system we are working on predictions so it can't affect decisions to offer a place except in borderline cases.\" Ms Chambers said providing more detail of AS-level results might help.</p> <p>Not all university admissions officers are in favour, however, as giving scores or A grade quartiles would limit their freedom of manoeuvre in choosing applicants from, say, working class backgrounds or poorly performing schools. </p> <p>A government inquiry headed by Steven Schwartz, vice-chancellor of Brunel University, has been wrestling with the problem of university admissions for the past year, trying to balance the government's desire for greater social fairness and more students from poor and ethnic minority families with the need for fairness between individuals applying for the same college place. </p> <p>Bristol University's efforts to broaden its intake led to a furious row with independent schools who feared their well-taught pupils were being discriminated against. The university refused to back down but has had to issue extremely detailed criteria for selection and might find it difficult to offer a place to a third quartile A grade candidate in preference to a top quartile one because of background factors.</p>",
  "<p>The Ferreira family on EastEnders has come in for a fair amount of criticism recently from TV reviewers for the unbelievable storylines, but now the fictional Albert Square clan are facing stick from another quarter - the Asian community.</p> <p>British Asians are unimpressed with the way they are being depicted with a resounding view that they are unrealistic and poorly researched, according to a new survey of 1,000 young Asian professionals.</p> <p>One 20 year old student says: \"The Ferreiras? Crap, unbelievable characters, negative storylines, totally unrealistic.\"</p> <p>Another, a teenage girl says: I think the Ferreiras are shit! The story lines are stupid, unrealistic and dull. Most Asians would not get evicted and then remain homeless, they would go to an aunty.\"</p> <p>The five-strong Ferreira family, who are apparently from Goa in India, were the first new Asian family to move into Walford since Gita and Sanjay Kapoor left in 1998. </p> <p>Bollywood star Dalip Tahil plays father Dan Ferreira, who moved into Mark Fowler's old house with his three sons - Ronnie, Ash and Adi - and daughter Kareena. Ronnie's childhood friend Tariq also soon turned up.</p> <p>But their arrival has not been welcomed by some of the young British Asians interviewed in June and July by online magazine Britainsasianassets.com.</p> <p>\"Shoot them all. None of them can act. They don't look like a family. How do you get a Tariq, a Ronnie, a Kareena and an Ash in one family? And Ferreira, how does that add up? It's lazy casting,\" a female journalist in her 20s told the survey.</p> <p>\"Tariq is a muslim name, Kareena is Hindu, Ash is a bit of a catch-all - it could be Muslim or Hindu - and Ronnie, where does that come from? Plus they have a Portugese surname, so why aren't they Catholic,\" said the barrister, Rehna Azim, who conducted the survey.</p> <p>Another respondent, a thirtysomething female PR manager, added: \"Just how many shades of brown can there be in one family? You can't put them in any context. They have no background.\"</p> <p>Storylines involving the Ferreiras since their arrival in Albert Square have included Dan abandoning his offspring, Tariq donating a kidney to Ronnie - after it emerged that he was actually a half-brother to the Ferreira kids - and the family having their house repossessed.</p> <p>One participant in the survey commented that the BBC \"should either do their research properly or get good Asian writers in\".</p> <p>\"The storylines are just unrealistic, even apart from the fact that the family is a hotchpotch. For example, an Asian father would be unlikely to abandon his family,\" said another.</p> <p>\"Most Asians are generally successful in the property market; their house would not be repossessed. Or they would get money from extended family. And four unemployed kids in one family? You wouldn't get that,\" was another comment.</p> <p>\"The Ferreiras should just be killed off. They are pointless, boring and the storylines are rubbish. Something like Goodness Gracious Me is better representation. It was funny and good for both insiders and outsiders,\" said another.</p> <p>However, EastEnders' executive producer, Louise Berridge, said her team had done more than two years of research about introducing a new Asian family to the show, when the Ferreiras were unveiled last year.</p> <p>\"After a search which has taken more than two years, and in which we have met literally hundreds of people, we have finally found the perfect cast for our dynamic new family,\" Ms Berridge said at the time.</p> <p>Ms Azim said that although some in the survey had a positive attitude to the Ferreiras, the vast majority cringed when they were mentioned. </p> <p>She said she planned to send the survey to the BBC so they could rectify the injustice in the portrayal of Asians in the east end of London.</p> <p>Viewers were also critical of Bollywood Star, Channel 4's answer to Pop Idol. </p> <p>\"I don't want to see programmes like Bollywood Star. It was shockingly bad anyway. But why segregate us? They should just include Asians in the main body of programmes. Asians are not a separate society in the UK, we are part of it,\" said a twenty-something PR account executive.</p> <p>\"The general view was that for a minority group Asians featured sufficiently in the media,\" says the report.</p> <p>But it goes on: \"The level of coverage was not an issue but the type of coverage was criticised because it was thought to be stereotypical - the common complaint was that the media divided Asians into two camps; either miserable folk being forced into loveless marriages or billionaires who had come to Britain with nothing and had now made a fortune. 'What about people like me who I can relate to?' was a comment that was often repeated.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>EASTENDERS' FERREIRA FAMILY</p> <p> \"There is the right level of coverage of Asians in the media although we need more young people, all the main people seem to be in their 30s and 40s like Meera Syal. I think the Ferreiras are shit! The story lines are stupid, unrealistic and dull. Most Asians would not get evicted and then remain homeless, they would go to an auntie.\" <br><strong>Student, female, teens</strong></p> <p>\"The Ferreiras? Crap, unbelievable characters, negative storylines, totally unrealistic. Television dramas always go for the extremes, either the characters are dull and being forced into arranged marriages or they are unbelievably raunchy. Bollywood Star on Channel 4 was just shockingly bad television. Where do they pick these stupid people from?\" <br><strong>Student, 20</strong></p> <p>\"The Ferreiras don't represent Asians. The storylines don't do justice to the Asian community or their way of life. For example it's highly unlikely that an Asian father would dump his children and leave them penniless. And you just wouldn't get a family with 4 unemployed siblings.\" <br><strong>Anjum Elahi, photographer, 30s</strong></p> <p>\"Just how many shades of brown can there be in one family - in more ways than one! It's good there are Asians in such a popular programme but they could have done so much more with them. The Ferreiras have no background. You can't put them in any context. Their storylines so far have all been negative. <br>Television drama should show more integrated second and third generation people. The media in general should not just show the extremes eg forced marriages or billionaires. The good thing is that Asians are currently riding a wave and when the wave comes down there will be a positive effect. We won't just be tokens anymore.\" <br><strong>PR manager, 30s</strong></p> <p>\"The Ferreiras should just be killed off. They are pointless, boring and the storylines are rubbish. Something like Goodness Gracious Me is better representation. It was funny and good for both insiders and outsiders. Also Asians are making more of a mark in music. You can hear influences in the music of people like Madonna and Britney. That's where the breakthrough will come.\" <br><strong>Account executive, 20s, female</strong></p> <p>\"The Ferreiras have grown on me. The characters break the stereotypes. But I don't get why - if they're all related - they have such different names. I mean, what religion are they, where are they from?\" <br><strong>Barrister, female, 30s</strong></p> <p>\"Asians in the mainstream are just token gestures. We need more programmes made by Asians about Asians. Asians should not sell out!\" <br><strong>Businessman, 30s</strong></p> <p>\"Asians are still just token characters. They don't get leading roles.\" <br><strong>Actress, 30s</strong></p> <p>\"We need to project ourselves from within our communities. We are a complex society and for us religion and politics often go hand and hand which affects our projection in the media and in our art\" <br><strong>Artist, female, 30s</strong></p> <p>\"The Ferreiras - shoot them all! None of them can act. They don't look like a family. What is it with the names? Tariq is Muslim, Kareena is Hindu, Ronnie is God knows from where, and what is Ash short for? It's lazy casting - filling in the quotas. Coronation Street does it so much better. They invest time in their characters and so you care about them.\" <br><strong>Journalist, 20s</strong></p> <p>\"Bollywood star was awful. Why segregate us? They should just include Asians in the main body of programmes. We are not a separate society within the UK, we are part of it. With the Ferreiras I think they do try. There have been some good storylines, like the gambling addiction and the father being the main carer rather than the mother - but then the writers seemed to have lost their nerve and not followed the stories through. They need to get good writers in or use good Asian ones.\" <br>Female, 20s</p>",
  "<p>Only presidential hopeful John Kerry scored more than Faria Alam last week. Column inches that is. The coverage afforded to Alam, for whatever reasons, confirmed the view of literate, middle class Asians that - for a minority group - we get a good share of media attention.</p> <p>That view was expressed by the people who participated in a media survey I recently conducted. It seemed extraordinary to me that the opinions of articulate, moderate, high achieving British Asians had not been canvassed before, considering their growing influence on the cultural and financial landscape of modern Britain.</p> <p>So I gave them a chance to have their say - and their views spilled out like a dam that had finally burst. From Islamophobia to the Ferreiras, they let rip.</p> <p>Key findings included the following: High achieving Asians do not use the Asian media, they rely almost wholly on the mainstream media for their news and entertainment. They mostly dislike the sensationalist tabloids, preferring the broadsheets. They are extremely well read. They are well informed about current affairs and are dismayed by the media's tendency to prefer the inarticulate and extreme Asian to the moderate and articulate. And they hate the Ferreira family in EastEnders.</p> <p>Ah, yes. Ronnie, Kareena, Ash, Tariq and the missing parents. </p> <p>The Hindu/Muslim/Catholic/whatever Ferreiras of Walford - or is it Goa? Who knows and frankly, it's clear that few care.</p> <p>While some survey participants offered tepid support for the family on the grounds that at least there was some Asian representation on primetime television, the vast majority wanted them killed off.</p> <p>\"Shoot them all now, please,\" pretty much summed up the general opinion.</p> <p>So, what is so wrong with them?</p> <p>Exactly what and who they are was the first query. In a bid possibly designed not to offend any Asian group, the writers obviously decided to bring the entire subcontinent together in one family. A politically laudable decision certainly, but a tad confusing for the average soap fan - even the intelligent ones who took part in the survey. As one woman put it, \"just how many shades of brown can there be in one family!\"</p> <p>The second trap the writers seem to have fallen into is that in trying not to make them stereotypical corner shop owners being forced into loveless marriages, they have created unbelievable characters in unrecognisable situations. So while in real life many Asians have an uncanny grip on the property market and pool their resources within extended families, the hapless Ferreiras - devoid of background or context - are served with repossession papers without a single loan-offering auntie in sight.</p> <p>In a survey involving lawyers, doctors, bankers and the like, it naturally grated too that the main Asian characters on television should be such a useless, unemployable bunch. Okay, so soaps are not real life but they should bear some relationship to reality. That's what makes the Slater sisters work so well, and in reality Walford's local solicitor and doctor would both be Asian.</p> <p>Admittedly the dreary Ferreiras are an easy target for ridicule - but they represent the biggest complaint made against the media by survey participants, namely lazy and poor research.</p> <p>People don't want more Asians in the media; they want \"better\" ones. Something beyond curry millionaires, miserable folk being forced into arranged marriages and alleged terrorists. \"I want to see, hear and read about people like me. People with a variety of lifestyles. Ordinary people,\" was a common plea.</p> <p>Muslims in particular were weary of seeing as \"the face of Islam\" women covered from head to toe in black and men with beards that would make Papa Smurf proud.</p> <p>\"If you put a woman on TV who is wrapped up in a sheet, it will put off 98% of the audience. There are other women who could represent the religion just as well whom the audience could relate to too,\" said one Muslim man.</p> <p>The media-picked \"beardy weirdy\", it seems, casts as long a shadow over the ordinary Muslim as an unrepresentative Ferreira does over the average Asian. 70% of my survey group chose BBC Radio 4 as their favourite station. Jeremy Paxman and Jon Snow were favourite presenters and the Economist was most popular magazine. But one wonders if the thick Ferreiras would know the difference between highbrow and the strips of hair above their too close-together-eyes.</p> <p>So what should the media do?</p> <p>Research, research, research say my survey participants. Cast your net far and wide. Television in particular can dispel and create myths in one fell swoop and, as the likes of the Cosby show and Oprah showed in the USA, public perceptions of minorities can be altered virtually overnight.</p> <p><em>\u00b7 Rehna Azim is a barrister and the editor of <a href=\"http://www.britainsasianassets.com\">www.britainsasianassets.com</a> which ran the media survey.</em></p>",
  "The Earl of Devon charges \u00a37,500-\u00a310,000 a day for eight people to shoot at Powderham castle in Devon but demands that everyone is a paid-up member of the Countryside Alliance. Lord Lyell is a stickler for shooters using biodegradeable cartridges on his vast Kildermorie estate in Ross-shire. Lord Clifford's loaders do not expect tips. As m'lud charges nearly \u00a32,000 per person per day, this could mean he is very generous or extremely stingy. <p>As the shooting season starts - red and sika stags last week in England and Wales, grouse and ptarmigan on Thursday the \"glorious 12th\" and partridge on September 1 - a new breed of well-heeled British shooter is scanning a publication which gives an insight into the idiosyncrasies of the people who own the great shooting estates and a guide to the etiquette demanded of the corporates and others who pay to shoot on their land. </p> <p>According to the Good Shoot Guide the Earl of Bradford, for a considerable fee, will serve champagne and homemade soup at Weston Park, Staffordshire, the venue for that other shooting match: the 2001 Northern Ireland peace talks. The Hambleden estate near Henley, Oxfordshire, recently for sale for \u00a316m, is the fluffiest in Britain. Deer shooters there, it seems, are not under any pressure to kill the animals \"if they feel unable to do so\". </p> <p>Best-heeled of all the landowners may be the Rt Hon Lewis Alexander Grant Ogilvie, Earl of Seafield, Viscount of Reidhaven and a baronet of Nova Scotia, who owns the 22,000-hectare (56,000 acre) Strathspey estate and charges \u00a33,500 a week per person for accommodation only. He will only tell you the price of the shooting if you are serious. </p> <p>The guide, an independent publication written by Tony Jackson, a former editor of Shooting Times, lists more than 250 private shooting estates and shows for the first time how much some of them charge, what game they offer, what tips should be given, how many birds or beasts can be expected to be killed a day and what you can expect in the way of nosh. </p> <p>Some pride themselves on offering sloe gin and sausages on arrival, others charge up to \u00a31,000 a night for a fully staffed lodge and a three course black tie evening with the laird. A few offer nothing but a cuppa with the gamekeeper at the end of the day. </p> <p>The guide suggests shooting has never been more popular in Britain, but it can never have been so expensive, either. The well-kitted corporate who wants a day stalking in the Highlands, and a stag's head trophy to hang on the wall, can expect to pay \u00a3800-\u00a31,000 for the beast, \u00a3300 for the clothes, \u00a350 to hire a gun, \u00a3200 just to go out on the hills with a stalker and up to \u00a31,000 for food, accommodation and flights. Tips, booze and taxidermy are extra. </p> <p>The bargain basement is not cheap either. Welsh shooters mainly spend about \u00a3125 a day to go on a shoot, \u00a321 for every bird they kill, the costs of the cartridges, gun, the lunch, and accommodation. </p> <p>Not mentioned in the guide is the hourly rate paid to beaters: usually just above the minimum wage. </p> <p>All field sports, says the publication, have grown in the past few years, with the age range widening and \"a significant influx of women and young shots\". </p> <p>Ironically, the guide thanks the Labour party for encouraging the sport and says the public's \"unfavourable stereotype of shooting\" is severely tested as more people try it for the first time. </p> <p>\"Shooting has benefitted with the government's 'anti-everything' policy and people are tiring of the nanny state and its political correctness. In spite of the antis' best efforts, shooting has been one of the things that has benefitted from this revolt,\" it says. </p> <p>\"One massive change is the removal of the snob factor ... it has become more approachable because the industry has realised that it has to get a broader mix of people for both political and financial reasons. People are becoming more educated ... more celebrities are advocating country sports,\" says the guide. </p> <p>But the etiquette has changed little since 1898 when the Prince of Wales shot 35 birds in one drive on the Tulchan estate in the Highlands. </p> <p>\"Nothing is more annoying\", says the guide, than the man who makes a practice of arriving late, who assumes his gundog is welcome, who doesn't bring enough cartridges, who turns up with a pump action gun, or who shoots 'sitters'. </p> <p>\"Knock [them] down in a cloud of feathers and you will soon acquire a reputation for being a thoroughly unsporting and greedy shot.\"</p> <p><b> Do</b><br> </p> <p> Tip \u00a310-\u00a320 </p> <p>Thank beaters </p> <p>Wear a neatly cut tweed suit </p> <p>Carry a capacious cartridge bag </p> <p>Carry an open shotgun</p> <p>Come with a well-trained dog </p> <p><b> Don't</b><br> </p> <p> Point your gun at anyone </p> <p>Shoot low birds </p> <p>Bring a pump action gun </p> <p>Arrive late</p>",
  "<p>Indiagames has secured a deal with Universal Studios to create mobile games based around, 'The Legacy of Bruce Lee'. In the <a href=\"http://mobenta.com/news/shownews-1827\">press release</a>, a deeply lyrical Jeremy Laws, vice-president of Media Licensing and Strategy at Universal Studios Consumer Products Group, commented:</p> <blockquote> \"Bruce Lee is a truly global brand.

The juxtaposition may seem stunningly inappropriate, but then Lee did theorise that a good fighter must keep his mind in a perpetual state of emptiness, surely something the average brand manager is familiar with.</p> <p>Anyway, this whole post was just an excuse to reminisce over the classic 1984 platformer, Bruce Lee, developed by Datasoft for the Apple II, Speccy and C64. Remember it? You had to guide Bruce through a wizard's fortress, constantly pursued by a ninja and some kind of rotund sumo character named Yamo. You could kick and punch them both, making this an early variant on the beat-'em-up genre.</p> <p>Best of all, a second player could take control of Yamo, ostensibly to make things harder for the chap playing Bruce.

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: Blunkett questions 'premature' intelligence leaks, international indifference to Darfur crisis sparks anger and freak wave scuppers transatlantic rowing bid.</p> <p><b>WARRANTS ISSUED FOR AHMED AND SALEM CHALABI</b></p> <p>The fall from grace of the Ahmed Chalabi, the man once favoured by the Pentagon as a future Iraqi leader, accelerated today as warrants were issued for the arrest of him and his nephew, Salem Chalabi.</p> <p>Ahmed Chalabi, founder of the Iraqi National Congress and former governing council member with close US ties, is accused of money laundering, while Salem Chalabi is wanted for murder, according to the Guardian.</p> <p>Both men have denied the accusations, which they say are politically motivated. Salem Chalabi, who as head of the Iraqi Special Tribunal is responsible for organising the trial of Saddam Hussein, was named as a suspect for the June murder of the director-general of the finance ministry.</p> <p>Ahmed Chalabi is accused of counterfeiting Iraqi dinars, which were removed from circulation after the fall of Saddam. He has promised to return to Iraq from Iran, says the FT, to face the charges. His nephew, currently in London, also plans to go back to clear his name.</p> <p>The move is a \"fresh blow to a dynasty with close former links to the Bush administration\", says the Independent.</p> <p>The issuing of the warrants also happens to coincide with the restoration of the death penalty in Iraq - which is what Salem Chalabi would face if he were convicted of murder.</p> <p>The return of capital punishment for the most serious crimes is a measure aimed at helping the interim government deal with the continuing insurgency, particularly in Najaf, where the forces of Moqtada al-Sadr continue their rebellion.</p> <p>A \"disturbing element\" of the battle for Najaf, says the Times in its leader, is Iranian \"intrigue\". \"The Iranian leadership claims it cannot control the deeds of volunteers [who are suspected of crossing the border to join the insurgency in Iraq]\", but \"there are strong reasons to suspect official involvement is far more substantial than has been admitted\".</p> <p>But, argues the Guardian, \"beyond the shadowy politics of interim Iraq, there is a too easily forgotten ongoing human tragedy. Whether the US troops killed 300 or 30 in Najaf, does anyone believe they were all gunmen?\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1279076,00.html\">Saddam trial chief faces Iraqi murder charge</a> <br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=549339\">Independent: Iraq restores death penalty as militants claim kidnapping of Iranian diplomat</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/ba757cd0-e996-11d8-b556-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Chalabi 'to return to Iraq to face charges'</a> <br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,542-1208035,00.html\">Times: Battle for Najaf</a> </p> <p> <b>BLUNKETT QUESTIONS 'PREMATURE' INTELLIGENCE LEAKS</b></p> <p>How much should the public be told about potential terror plots and the security forces' counter-terrorism measures? That is the question at the heart of the Telegraph's front page piece today on Washington's defence of its decision to \"prematurely leak\" the names of arrested militants.</p> <p>The Bush administration has \"come out fighting\" after criticism - not least from Britain's home secretary David Blunkett - that it caused a needless panic when it announced the seizure of computer files containing al-Qaida intelligence on possible bombing targets.</p> <p>Democrats also accused the White House of playing \"election year politics\" with the information, says the paper. </p> <p>But Washington reacted by \"disclosing still more data\", telling Time magazine about PC disks found in Pakistan contained more than 500 photographs of five financial institutions and \"detailed discussions of how to attack them\".</p> <p>An anonymous military source is quoted as saying that there are, in fact, benefits to spreading panic - providing it affects the terrorists rather than the general population. \"People get flushed out when that happens and they get nervous. As they start to move, they talk and we hear them. It's like hunting birds: you scare 'em up, they run, then you shoot them.\"</p> <p>That's the theory, anyway, but the Telegraph does not seem altogether won over by the argument. Perhaps, as it says in its leader on the subject, Mr Blunkett was right to suggest (in yesterday's Observer) that \"in the United States there is often high-profile commentary followed ... by detailed scrutiny, with the risks of inviting ridicule\".</p> <p>Nevertheless, Mr Blunkett's \"public reticence\" about the war on terror has created \"heated debates about how far the sacrifice of civil liberties is justifiable\".</p> <p>The Mail says Mr Blunkett's comments have raised tensions between London and Washington, and created \"the spectacle of top politicians on both sides of the Atlantic effectively condemning each other's policies\".</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=YA1MGM21IFXSPQFIQMFCNAGAVCBQYJVC?view=SECURELOGIN&amp;grid=P21&amp;nextPage=/RiK2/wXeR.WZvwF?7wF~/RiK2/s119/1N/14/Kvigg14.7wF!2qZiiv~/UDgvXF/s119/1N/14/e7UDgvXFvDU.ZvwF!2iG3gimiygi2Z~vg3i&amp;resize=null&amp;_requestid=5851\">Telegraph: US hits back in row over terror leaks (login required)</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1279158,00.html\">Brown's photo 'on al-Qaida disks'</a><br></p> <p><b>FRUSTRATION AT INTERNATIONAL INDIFFERENCE TO DARFUR CRISIS</b></p> <p>The Independent devotes its first three pages for the launch of its Darfur Appeal.

  "<p>You'd call him the grandfather of stand-up comedy, if grandfather didn't seem altogether too cosy. He's Richard Pryor: writer, entertainer, film star and the man whose incendiary comic interventions into 1970s America moulded stand-up into the artform we know today. Before Pryor, stand-up in the US was Bob Hope and Bob Newhart: mild one-liners delivered by cheerful men in shirts and ties. Pryor, by stark contrast, was scabrous and confessional, sexy, vernacular, and totally unpredictable. </p> <p>Born in 1940, his background is itself the stuff of jet-black comedy. The son of a prostitute and a pimp, he grew up in his grandmother's brothel in poverty-stricken Peoria, Illinois. As a youth, he worked as a shoe-shine, meat-packer, truck-driver and billiard-hall attendant. In 1963, he moved to New York, to practise stand-up in the Bill Cosby vein, and was soon a regular on US TV variety shows. But his legend really began some years later when, frustrated at having to suppress his own identity in the name of light entertainment, he quit New York for counter-cultural California. </p> <p>When Pryor re-emerged in the early 1970s, it was with a brand of stand-up that no one had seen before. Angry, impassioned, truthful and personal, Pryor spoke about his world: a world of winos, bums and junkies; of black-white inequality; of sex, politics and sexual politics. And then there was the delivery - Pryor delivered comedy like a musician delivers jazz. But it wasn't just stand-up that he radicalised: many credit Pryor with blazing a trail for black people in American life. According to the musician Quincy Jones, he was \"a pioneer ... who made us understand the truth about ourselves\".</p> <p>If this coruscating stand-up is Pryor's major legacy, he'll also be remembered for a middling career in Hollywood film (credits include co-scripting Mel Brooks's Blazing Saddles and starring in Superman III). His life took a grim turn in the early 1980s, when he set himself on fire while free-basing cocaine, and suffered third-degree burns to over 50% of his body. In 1986, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. He continued working as a comedian into the following decade, but the disease currently prevents him performing. </p> <p>This year at Edinburgh, Pryor will be judging video submissions for the inaugural Richard Pryor award, to be given to the outstanding ethnic minority comedy act on the Fringe. Edinburgh is notoriously under-attended by black stand-ups, a fact that the award seeks to help redress. </p> <p><strong> Ross Noble:</strong> Having heavily emulated Bill Cosby before finding your own voice, how does it feel seeing your influence on subsequent generations?</p> <p><strong> Richard Pryor:</strong> I hope the younger comics will find their own voice. It's the hardest thing to do. It can hide, but keep looking for it. </p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> Having said that you regret using the word \"nigger\" on and off stage, how do you feel about its use by younger comics today? </p> <p><strong>RP:</strong> I did and do use it at times. The way most comics use it is for shock and all it does is disappoint. The only comic I hear use it to fit a routine is [US comic] Dave Chappelle. He can do it. </p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> After you set yourself on fire, did the physical change affect your performance or the way audiences responded to you?</p> <p><strong>RP:</strong> The fire didn't change a thing - except the way I looked in the mirror. I kept my shit on when I was on stage - people seemed to love me more.</p> <p><strong>RN:</strong> You had monkeys and a miniature horse. Have you got any fun animals now? </p> <p><strong>RP:</strong> My dogs, Homer and Spirit, are fun. They make me laugh. </p> <p><strong>Richard Herring:</strong> Where do you get your crazy ideas from? </p> <p><strong>RP:</strong> My ideas came from my life. </p> <p> <strong> Jimmy Carr: </strong> I know you don't perform any more for obvious reasons but do you still write material? If the answer is yes, can I have it? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> I think about it but don't really write any more. Except to answer all these questions! </p> <p> <strong> Sarah Kendall: </strong> Of all of your recorded performances which one do you feel was your personal best and why? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> I love Live in Concert and some of the NBC Shows - 'cause they were raw and make me laugh now. </p> <p> <strong> SK: </strong> Have you ever gone through phases when you have hated doing stand-up? If so, what made you enjoy it again? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> After the fire, it was hard to get on stage again. But I just kept doing it and the joy and fun came back. </p> <p> <strong> Lenny Henry: </strong> Are there any taboos left in comedy? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Taboos? Not really, but doing comedy well is hard. </p> <p> <strong> LH: </strong> Did Paul Mooney write the Just Us joke on Is It Something I Said? Or was he a constant collaborator? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Paul takes too much fucking credit for my shit, let him take credit for his own. Just Us, we wrote for [the 1970s US sitcom] Sandford and Son. He was one of the writers on my NBC Shows and a writer on [Pryor's autobiographical movie] Jo-Jo Dancer. But Paul needs to take credit for HIS stuff and leave my shit the fuck alone! </p> <p> <strong> Addy Borgh: </strong> Which of your demons have you found hardest to deal with - and talk about on stage? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Which demon? Shit, I dunno his name. The one who fucked me the most. Drugs, women, whoever was winning at the moment. </p> <p> <strong> AB: </strong> How much did the women you knew shape or inform your comedy other than in the material? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Women have always inspired my comedy but [my current wife] Jenny actually helped me more than anybody. And thank God for her now. </p> <p> <strong> AB: </strong> Which was the best drug you ever did: sex, coke or comedy? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Damn, comedy without a doubt. Sex a close second </p> <p> <strong> Lee Mack: </strong> Why did The Richard Pryor Show only last for four episodes in the 1970s? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Four was plenty. The studio started fucking with me too much. It stopped being fun. And I knew it wouldn't be good any more. </p> <p> <strong> Chris Addison: </strong> You're seen as an icon of comedy by everyone who came after you. Do you feel like your stand-up was ground-breaking, and did it feel like it at the time? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> I just did my work and let it speak for itself. I never stopped to judge how ground-breaking it would be. I was too busy trying to get it right. </p> <p> <strong> Reginald D Hunter: </strong> How do you feel about the Richard Pryor award at this year's Edinburgh festival? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Jenny and I are really excited, 'cause the Fringe has got to mix it up a bit. I mean, you are all too white over there!!! I like that this is opening things up a bit. That's what I do. </p> <p> <strong> RDH: </strong> You once said that it takes a comic 15 years to find his voice. Do you still believe that? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> I think it takes a long fuckin' time to find your voice, hopefully not longer than 15! </p> <p> <strong> RDH: </strong> You once described how you could sometimes feel yourself pulling out of jokes, pulling away from areas that are more dangerous or unknown. You panic sometimes because you want to get to the laugh. What is it that you have to overcome - is it fear? Did you ever beat that - and if so, how? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> The toughest thing is to wait for that laugh and handle those silences, handle the fear - ride out that silence and don't panic. Have faith. It's like that giant wave those surfers wait for. When it comes, it's heaven. </p> <p> <strong> Bob Wiltfong: </strong> It's not unusual after one of your jokes for me to mumble the phrase \"That's so true ...\" after I get done laughing. When you write jokes, are you consciously looking for truthful things to write about or are you just looking to make people laugh - whether it's truthful or not? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Truthful, always truthful. And funny will come. </p> <p> <strong> BW: </strong> When you were coming up, your stand-up was considered cutting edge. Where do you think the cutting edge of comedy is going these days? Do you like or dislike where it's going? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> Only a few comics are being really honest and daring, and not just going for the okee-doke. I love Chris Rock, and Chappelle. Colin Quinn is dangerous. There are some I see that will grow or not. I don't know all their names. </p> <p> <strong> Jeff Green: </strong> Richard Pryor Live in Concert (1979) was shown late night on Channel 4 in 1983 and was my inspiration for wanting to be a stand-up comic. In my humble opinion it is the greatest stand-up concert of all time - how long did it take you to get the show together and how did it feel on the night? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> It took about six to eight months, including many nights at the Comedy Store and on the road. I was nervous but really excited when we shot it. I was glad when it was over, and let down. </p> <p> <strong> Al Murray: </strong> What do you think of critics? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> I never met anybody who said when they were a kid, \"I wanna grow up and be a critic.\" </p> <p> <strong> Jason Byrne: </strong> You talk about Muhammad Ali in your latest DVD and how frightening it was to be in the ring with him. But do you reckon you could beat him now that the two of you shake like maracas? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> That's your fuckin' question? </p> <p> <strong> Jeremy Hardy: </strong> What has been the proudest achievement of your career? </p> <p> <strong> RP: </strong> I suppose if I had to say, Live in Concert I like the best. Achievement? Making people laugh is a great achievement!</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Live in Concert is screening throughout the Edinburgh Festival at the Warner Cinema on Leith Street.</p>",
  "A British scientist who has studied the Chernobyl nuclear disaster for more than 10 years has been placed on the Belarussian KGB's \"forbidden persons list\" and banned from the country for five years. <p>Alan Flowers, a professor at Kingston University, was expelled from the former Soviet republic last weekend, just a few weeks after arriving for a lecture tour on an invitation from the state university. </p> <p>He had regularly conducted studies, testing radioactive content in soil, and had his visa renewed in March to continue his work in the country. </p> <p>Detailing his expulsion for the first time, he told the Guardian that he believed the move was an attempt to gag him by the current Belarussian government, led by the hardline president, Aleksandr Lukashenko. </p> <p>His research could have the potential to embarrass past and present governments. </p> <p>\"They claim to be a democracy and with the Chernobyl research I was working in conjunction with the university, which claims it is dedicated to free and open speech,\" Dr Flowers said. </p> <p>\"But whether it is Stalinist purges in the 1930s or the Soviet reaction to Chernobyl, any detrimental history is not greatly encouraged for consumption of Belarus people. </p> <p>\"It's just not given prominence by the present administration.\" </p> <p>The professor said until his expulsion he had been carrying out his work unimpeded and had not been approached by the authorities at any time with suggestions that he had broken any law. </p> <p>But on the afternoon of July 29, when he went to meet the director of the university, Dr Flowers was greeted by a member of the secret service, which still calls itself the KGB, and one member of the local passport registration office. </p> <p>\"My passport was in order, my visa had been granted in March but they told me I was illegally in the territory of Belarus and must leave.\" </p> <p>When he questioned the order, Dr Flowers was told only that his name was on the blacklist and that he was therefore banned from the country. The official's actions had been in no way threatening, he said, and he had been treated with courtesy and respect. </p> <p>\"A police officer actually apologised to me at the end and asked me if I was completely satisfied with the proceedings,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But at the end of the day, if they decide they don't want you there, you are really just going through the process. The policeman who first took my passport said: 'I do hope, Dr Flowers, that this is a mistake.\"' </p> <p>He was told the decision had been taken by the KGB in consultation with several other authorities, including the interior ministry. </p> <p>The next day he attended the local passport office, and left the country the following Monday. </p> <p>The Foreign Office would say only that it was still awaiting an explanation from the Belarussian government to clarify what had happened. Dr Flowers said it had lodged a protest on his behalf, asking for his visa to be reinstated. </p> <p>For more than 10 years Dr Flowers has taken part in scientific exchanges with academics in Belarus. He says he has always had full cooperation from staff there. </p> <p>But the government has been known to gag outspoken researchers. </p> <p>In 2001, Yuri Bandazhevsky, the country's leading scientist, who had tried to highlight the effects of the Chernobyl disaster on children, was sentenced to eight years in a labour camp after a court found him guilty of taking bribes from students. </p> <p>Newspapers in Moscow reported last week that a Russian broadcasting company had been closed down after a report on a protest against President Lukashenko was deemed \"improper\". </p> <p>Dr Flowers believes his expulsion is a sign of declining academic freedom. \"I haven't changed with what I am doing in the past 10 years but the perception of the Belarus authority has changed towards me.\"</p>",

  "<p>Do you spend the nine-to-five fantasising about a creative vocation? Do you believe you could have been a contender, given the chance? Offices are full of people who fell into their jobs, when they really wanted to be actors, artists or pop stars. But then: reality check - you've got to pay the rent. So people with creative ambitions get defeated by the maths - struggling artists are poor, and writers starve in garrets - don't they? Well, they can and often do. But it doesn't have to be that way. With careful planning, it is possible to keep money coming in, while also following your dream. </p> <p>Pete Mauder was realistic. He knew that to make his dream come true, he would have to resign from a full-time job and freelance instead. Freed from 40 hours a week in an office, he now fits in graphic design work around his music. \"It would be foolish to give up the paid job - you have to keep the wolf from the door,\" he says. \"I do know of musicians who won't work at all, to commit full-time to the art. But they sign on, or have parents who subsidise them.\" </p> <p>Jessica Jarvis, of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, agrees with Mauder's approach. Even in today's celebrity-hungry world, \"only a small percentage of people actually get to be a 'star',\" she points out. \"So you should have alternative career paths and build up other skills, in case things don't work out.\" </p> <p>While doing an MA in screenwriting, Ellie Woodcock took a part-time job in a shop. \"I get good characters to write about from the shoppers who come in,\" she says. \"A friend of mine gave up his day job to create full time, but he's now getting a part-time job. He found writing too intense to do all the time.\" Work keeps that creeping sense of isolation and despair from setting in when things aren't going well creatively, and the social interaction keeps you in touch with your audience, readers, or viewers. </p> <p>Sophie Relf, head of campaign management at <a href=\"http://www.workthing.com\">workthing.com</a>, believes that the secret of success is all in the planning. For people with ambitions to be writers or actors, who need financial security till success beckons, she counsels: \"Start by working out when and how much time per day you need to dedicate to your creative interest, and work back from there. So, if you need to attend daytime auditions, do an evening or weekend job. Then work out what you are good at: if you are a natural at a subject, you are more likely to be able to make money in a job from it\". Relf suggests looking at jobs in customer service, sales, retail, catering and hospitality, tourism and leisure. \"These all offer a rich source of flexible or part-time work, so you can take up any offers of creative work that come your way.\" </p> <p>Ash Chandola runs the Swaraj club night and produces Asian fusion music with his band, Sonik Gurus. He comments: \"You do have to make sacrifices if you want to break through as an artist. It would be impossible for me to work full-time: for example, I often need to fly to India to do the club night. So, I am always short of money. I manage that by living at home with my parents - not ideal! I may get a part-time job, to bring some cash in - on a label, or in promotions. It has to be work related to my passion for music.\" </p> <p>Creative people could try teaching their interest to others. \"Activities like dance, music and drama are now largely extra-curricular,\" says Relf. \"Many parents look to private sources for this part of education. You do not need qualifications to teach privately. And City and Guilds run assessor NVQ courses in many creative industries, like fashion and photography. Qualified assessors are very sought after - this is a great supplementary career.\" </p> <p>Research by reed.co.uk found that one in four temps is \"following their dream\". It is the flexibility of temping that is attractive to wannabes, although some posts are more flexible than others. \"People with specialised skills may find it easier to organise flexible working,\" says Alexandra Jones of the Work Foundation. \"Employers want to retain the highly skilled.\" </p> <p>When people ask photographer Kofi Allen \"Wow, how do you get to do that?\" he always replies \"With great sacrifice!\" \"I want to do my art full-time,\" he says. \"But it's very competitive, and you can wait ages till the next project comes in. I don't want to pimp my passion by doing the 9-5 just to pay the bills. But I will take a part-time job in a related field, maybe consultancy, to keep afloat.\" </p> <p>\"Do something about your ambition every day, no matter how small,\" Relf advises. \"Don't lose sight of the fact that you work to live, not the other way round. Have milestones, and celebrate them as you achieve them.\" </p> <p>Billy Connolly was a welder, French and Saunders were teachers, Harrison Ford a carpenter - they all had a dream, and fulfilled it. Not by luck but by a combination of passion and persistence. And when you get disheartened just try to think that the struggle will just add to the satisfaction of ultimately achieving success.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's employers are looking nervously over their shoulders as the European Agency Workers Directive steams towards Westminster. Last week, the CBI was sounding the alarm, anxious that the government might see a rigid application of the directive as a way to mend fences with the unions. The directive, which grants temps rights equal to those enjoyed by permanent colleagues, is now seen as unstoppable. All that remains is to settle how long a period temps must work to qualify for their rights. The TUC thinks a day, the CBI a year. The government is likely to aim for a compromise of six weeks. </p> <p>The CBI estimates that 700,000 are employed as temps, which is an interesting figure, because only a few years ago the recruitment industry estimated that a million temps were at work on any given day. Temps are, of course, notoriously difficult to count. It is not impossible for a temp to occupy the same desk on consecutive days for two different agencies. But 300,000 is hardly a reasonable margin of error. Could the number of temps be shrinking of its own accord? </p> <p>Temping is often credited as the reason why unemployment is lower here than in France and Germany. Temps represent flexibility, a word which is increasingly taking on a different meanings - although whenever it is wielded, people do seem to mean it as a positive thing. Temps allow businesses to expand quickly in the event of a sudden upturn, and allow employers to increase the workforce without committing themselves forever. Nearly a third of all temping assignments are of this nature. Employers and the recruiting industry argue that if businesses do not have this flexibility, they might prefer not to expand at all. </p> <p>Although the stereotype of the temp as a woman office worker does represent a large proportion of agency employees, agency work is also implicated in some of the murkier employment practices that have been building up over the past few years - in particular the use of migrant casual labour in agriculture. Nobody denies that the employment law governing agency workers, originally drafted over 30 years ago, needs revision.</p>",
  "<p>The legal world is a fast and furious one. The profession is in the midst of huge change. Lawyers are coming under increased scrutiny, their fee structures and regulatory bodies are changing and every day there is a huge raft of redesigned or supplementary legislation that needs to be rapidly absorbed and relayed to clients. In order to help them cope with the constant demands of the law, partners and associates depend perhaps more than most on their secretaries. </p> <p>Flexibility is essential under these conditions. \"In this job, you often get asked an hour before home time to stay late, and you have to be able to do it,\" says Karen Hayward, who works in the employment department of a mid-tier city firm. \"Lawyers get more last-minute stuff than most - it can be very quiet or mad panics for completions and so on, especially in commercial departments. In employment, you often need to help a client who needs to fire someone urgently before they steal information from computer databases. Then it's all hands to the pumps.\" </p> <p>Even in the midst of a whirlwind at work it's important to be able to stay focused. \"You need the ability to remain calm and professional at all times,\" says Jeyda Star, who works in the competition law department of a Magic Circle firm in the city. \"And to be able to prioritise work despite the tight deadlines.\" </p> <p>Heather Lawson, manager of Career Legal's temp recruitment division backs this up \"The job has changed dramatically over recent years. \"Fee-earners have become more IT-literate and look for secretaries who are conscientious and are willing to go the extra mile to make life easier for others in the department.\" </p> <p>As in any secretarial job, good communication skills are vital, but they are particularly valued within the legal profession because the vast majority of clients, especially in litigation and family law departments, are people with a problem whose stress levels can mean they require careful handling. \"Clients can be very, very upset, especially in divorce and custody battles,\" says Claire, a secretary at a high-street firm specialising in family disputes. \"You have to be able to keep talking to them, support them and not take the fact that they are crying or shouting at you personally.\" </p> <p>A strong streak of perfectionism will also help. \"Legal documents require accuracy and we are required to produce first-class, perfect documents at all times,\" says Star. \"You mustn't send anything out without being very careful, very particular,\" agrees Hayward. \"Type the wrong word - even a wrong comma - in a legal document and you can inadvertently bring in a whole new meaning.\" </p> <p>But what can you expect in return? \"Money!\" laughs Lawson. \"Legal secretarial work has a premium over other sectors. Temps can expect to earn between \u00a312 and \u00a314 an hour and permanent staff with three or four years' experience can look for \u00a326-30,000 a year. That's basic salary. The bigger law firms, especially the Magic Circle, have other perks too, like free gym membership, in-house dry cleaners, season-ticket loans and incentive schemes.\" But there are other benefits too. In-house courses and training seminars are often provided by firms and ensure that your skills are always kept up to date. And it can be a very rewarding job. \"Every day is different and brings new challenges,\" says Star. \"You are treated as part of a transaction team, not just a typist [and] client liaison ensures that you always feel involved.\" </p> <p>\"I used to work in an accountancy firm,\" says Hayward. \"And that was pretty boring. With employment work, it's easier to get involved. The files are about situations you can understand and relate to. And although you don't have to, I like to read the new legislation and articles in law magazines as they come out and keep abreast of what's going on. It's educational and it helps you comprehend what you're working on, which always makes it more interesting.\" </p> <p>And there is an almost unlimited supply of specialist departments within firms . You can move around until you find one which particularly piques your interest. The law, for secretaries at least, might not be such an ass after all.</p>",
  "<p>There was an awkward moment when our last colleague left suddenly. He was given time to clear his desk, but not his laptop. </p> <p>And unfortunately on that laptop there were - gulp - 24 job applications and a small stash of soft porn, found by his manager. Definitely embarrassing, but at least he'd already had the sack by then. And this revealing excavation sent a few of us to racing to our computers for a rapid clean up of personal emails. Never lull yourself into a false sense of security with your office computer - that's the message here. </p> <p>The office laptop or PC isn't \"yours\" and never will be. It's company property, and even your deleted emails could be read by the IT department. \"Don't I know it. I got hooked trading on eBay with my 50s film collectables hobby and thought my sales and buys were private - I deleted them instantly, says Mike Barnes, a south London sales executive. \"But a note came round from IT warning all staff about spending company time on eBay. Apparently at least 60% of private emails were eBay-related.\" </p> <p>\"Never use your office computer for any purpose that might embarrass you. It's best to always use it as if your boss were watching over your shoulder,\" cautions Ronnie Fox, employment specialist lawyer with Fox Williams in London. While your desk can be used for personal belongings and private documents, your desktop should not be, so never confuse the two, even if your main relationship at the office is with that computer. </p> <p>If you decide to take your company to a tribunal for unfair dismissal and loss of earnings, the fact that you had job applications on your desktop will certainly not impress the judges. And if you're looking for a good character reference, then any sleaze on your screen will put the mockers on that. </p> <p>Also damaging would be emails slagging off the firm or the boss, hurtful gossip, emails sent to mates at rival firms. \"Anything discovered afterwards is not taken into account in unfair dismissal but might have a bearing if the dismissed employee made a claim for costs. For example, if the laptop showed he was on the point of starting a new job - but he later tried to claim for loss of earnings - that would clearly have an adverse effect,\" says Fox. </p> <p>But most employers do allow for \"reasonable private use\" of email. You might well have to contact your family, send an urgent message or make a sudden travel booking by email.</p> <p>\"More and more employers have a \"computer code\" which staff have to click through every time they switch on the computer. This acts as a permanent reminder not to abuse its use,\" says Fox. </p> <p>You might keep a spare tie, shaver, cosmetics, private documents and photos in your desk and if you are suddenly sacked, you should always be given time to clear out personal possessions. </p> <p>\"But employers do not have to give you time to wipe your computer - that belongs to the company,\" says Fox firmly. </p> <p>Should employees be allowed genuinely private email which only they can access? \"Some companies do this, but there are costs involved. Reasonable personal use is the norm,\" he says. </p> <p>So next time you have a row with your boss, don't just count to 10 before firing of a vitriolic email to a friend - count to 100. And then don't send anything. You could live to regret it.</p> <p><strong>Laptop law - a guide to dos and don'ts </strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Never send out job applications via your company email - or even by company post. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't forget that even deleted emails can still be read by IT admin staff.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't get into the habit of thinking of the computer as \"yours\" - it's the company's. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you receive any pornographic material by email, delete it immediately.<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> Never send emails slagging off your boss. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"Intimate\" emails are never a good idea. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Remember that if you're suddenly shown the door, you are entitled to clear your desk but not your computer.</p>",
  "Salem Chalabi, the man organising the trial of Saddam Hussein, was facing a murder charge himself last night after an Iraqi judge issued a warrant for his arrest. <p>Another was issued for his uncle Ahmed Chalabi, the founder of the Iraqi National Congress and a former key ally of the US. He is accused of money laundering.</p> <p>Both men denied the accusations, which they said were politically motivated.</p> <p>Salem Chalabi, head of the Iraqi Special Tribunal, was named as a suspect for the murder in June of Haithem Fadhil, director general of the finance ministry.</p> <p>Last night he said the allegations were designed to interfere with preparations for the trial of senior officials of the former regime.</p> <p>If convicted he could face the death penalty, which was restored by the Iraqi interim government yesterday.</p> <p>It was unclear last night what impact the warrant would have on the trials of Saddam and other officials of his former regime.</p> <p>Salem Chalabi, who is in London, said in February he thought it could be two years before Saddam appeared in court.</p> <p>The US has handed Saddam over to the Iraqis for trial.</p> <p>\"The warrant for me has to do with the fact that apparently I threatened somebody. I have no recollection of ever meeting that person, but apparently I threatened somebody who subsequently was killed,\" he told CNN.</p> <p>\"I don't think that I had anything to do with the charges so I'm not actually worried about it. It's a ridiculous charge, that I threatened somebody. There's no proof there.\"</p> <p>Iraq's senior investigative judge, Zuhair al-Maliky, said that nobody in Iraq should enjoy immunity. \"They should be arrested and then questioned and then we will evaluate the evidence, and then if there is enough evidence, they will be sent to trial.\"</p> <p>Ahmed Chalabi is accused of counterfeiting Iraqi dinars removed from circulation after Saddam's regime fell. The fake money was allegedly found in his house.</p> <p>His spokesman, Haidar al-Moussawi, said: \"Such a warrant has been issued, but no one called any of the accused or gave them a chance before issuing the arrest warrant. These are very bad indications about the state of justice and law in the new Iraq.\"</p> <p>Both men said they would return to Iraq to face the charges.</p> <p>Ahmed Chalabi, attending a conference in Tehran, called the allegations \"outrageous\" and \"manufactured lies\".</p> <p>He told CNN: \"I'm now mobilised on all fronts to rebuff all these charges. Nobody's above the law and I submit to the law in Iraq, despite my serious and grave reservations about this court. I have been fighting Saddam for many years and we survived that and we are certainly not going to be intimidated by this judge.\"</p> <p>Last night Salem Chalabi described the charge against his uncle as \"weird\".</p> <p>\"It has to do with counterfeit money and I was told that when they raided his house a couple of months ago they found the equivalent of a few dollars in counterfeit dollars that he was given as head of the financial committee of the governing council,\" he said.</p> <p>The accusation against Ahmad Chalabi is a severe embarrassment to the US, which once considered him prime candidate to replace Saddam.</p> <p>Washington has attempted to distance itself from him since it was suggested that he provided faulty intelligence about Iraq's WMD capacity.</p> <p>He did not get a job in the interim government.</p> <p>Mr Chalabi was recently accused of informing Iran that the US had broken its secret intelligence codes.

  "Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, yesterday sought to stamp his authority on the perilous security situation in southern Iraq, flying into the strife-torn city of Najaf and ordering the Mahdi fighters of the rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr to leave. <p>The surprise trip came as his government announced the reintroduction of the death penalty suspended by the US occupation authorities after the fall of Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>Officials said the move was part of a raft of measures designed to impose the rule of law in Iraq and stem the violence that has shown little sign of easing since the US officially ended its occupation at the end of June. </p> <p>In Najaf, where the US military and the nascent Iraqi security forces have been battling armed loyalists of Mr Sadr, a heavily guarded Mr Allawi ordered the Mahdi militia to leave the holy city. </p> <p>\"We hope that this thing ends as soon as possible,\" Mr Allawi told reporters. \"I believe gunmen should leave the holy sites ... quickly, lay down their weapons and return to the rule of order and law.\" </p> <p>Najaf has seen some of the most ferocious fighting in Iraq for months, which has also sparked fighting in Shia areas of Baghdad and several cities across southern Iraq. Scores have been killed and hundreds wounded. </p> <p>Mr Allawi, who appears determined to give at least the impression of being in charge, held talks with the governor of Najaf, Adnana al-Zurfi. But his demands seemed to carry little weight with the Mahdi fighters, who roamed the streets of Najaf, fortifying their positions with mines. </p> <p>Shortly after Mr Allawi's visit, witnesses said, fighting again broke out at the cemetery, where much of the battle has raged since Thursday. </p> <p>Sheikh Ahmed al-Shaybani, a spokesman for Mr Sadr in Najaf, said: \"We were hoping that Mr Allawi would come here just to make the situation calm down. But, unfortunately, he has just complicated and escalated the situation by demanding that Moqtada's people leave Najaf.\" </p> <p>The death penalty was reinstated for a number of crimes including murder, kidnapping and drug offences. </p> <p>Alarmed by the failure of the US-led forces and the Iraqi police to deliver security since the fall of Saddam, many Iraqis have said that they wanted to see serious crimes punished in a way they feel is appropriate. </p> <p>\"This is not an open door to execute anyone and everyone, or people whom the government dislikes. This is not Saddam's law,\" Adnan al-Janabi, a minister, said. \"There is no attempt and no hint that we want to punish political differences. We want to bring peace and security to the country.\" </p> <p>On Saturday Mr Allawi also announced a long-awaited amnesty for minor criminals, which officials hope will take some of the sting out of the insurgency. </p> <p>The size of the task was underlined when six explosions boomed across central Baghdad last night, sending plumes of smoke into the air. There were reported to be several casualties. </p> <p>Meanwhile, according to video shown on al-Arabiya television station, insurgents said they had taken an Iranian diplomat hostage. The video showed a bearded man identified as Faridoun Jihani, an Iranian representative in Kerbala. </p> <p>The kidnappers, who called themselves the \"Islamic army in Iraq\", accused Mr Jihani of provoking sectarian war in Iraq and warned Iran not to interfere in Iraq's affairs.</p>",
  "From a government which has been so trigger-happy about changing criminal law, the ministerial response at the end of last week to the latest proposals from their law reform advisers was pathetic. The law commissioners had been asked to examine whether provocation, a partial defence to murder that allows defendants to plead guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter, should be abolished. What it found when it began its consultation exercise was widespread discontent with the murder law across a much wider front. It also found judicial concern that all that would be achieved by its current review would be an inadequate \"patching exercise\". <p>To their credit the commissioners recognised that what was needed was a comprehensive review of murder - the first since the royal commission on capital punishment between 1949 and 1953 - along with another look at mandatory life sentences that convicted murderers currently receive. Even though the \"breadth and depth of discontent\" was strongest with respect to mandatory sentences, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland responded immediately, insisting there would be no move to change it. Why not? Both judges, whom ministers are ready to ignore, but also Joe Public, whom they normally slavishly follow, want change. The current system is totally irrational. There have been a number of mercy killings in the news columns in recent weeks: relatives who have helped children or relatives in the last stages of painful and incurable diseases to die. Does Baroness Scotland, QC, really believe they should receive the same sentence as a serial killer like the Yorkshire Ripper? About 75% of people consulted said there should be no custodial sentences in mercy killings. As the law commission noted last week, a logical system would grade into different categories the different forms of murder and assign different sentences. </p> <p>As for provocation, the commission did not believe it should be abolished as Harriet Harman, solicitor general, has urged. Instead it has proposed changes that would make it more available to abused partners who kill in self-defence and prevent it being used by murderers who kill for revenge. This looks a more judicious settlement. What all progressives should unite on is insisting that ministers follow their own mantra: the need for evidence-based policy-making. Fifty years on since the last comprehensive review of the offence, it is time for a new look. Far better this is pursued in a rational manner, than by a knee-jerk response to the media.</p>",
  "As doctors working with asylum seekers we have grave concerns about the government's proposals to restrict failed asylum seekers' access to primary care (see <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk\">www.dh.gov.uk</a>). If these proposals are adopted, failed asylum seekers will only be able to obtain free emergency or \"immediately necessary\" treatment from GPs. They would be expected to pay for all other treatment but, as they are not allowed to claim benefits or to work, they would effectively be excluded from most forms of healthcare. <p>It seems to be assumed that failed asylum seekers are removed from the UK and so do not need healthcare, but this is often not the case - many countries remain too dangerous to return people. </p> <p>Experience in Newcastle indicates that one-third of asylum seekers give a history of torture, while 22% of women give a history of rape. The physical and mental pain caused by these events does not go away when an asylum claim is refused: it frequently intensifies - with a greater need for ongoing support, observation and treatment. </p> <p>It is often very difficult to determine exactly what a person's asylum status is. Yet GPs' receptionists, with no training in complex asylum law, will be expected to decide on this and whether a medical problem is an emergency. This will cause chaos at doctors' receptions. Although treatment for serious infections (except HIV) will remain free, failed asylum seekers will be excluded from GP screening and opportunistic case-finding for conditions such as TB. Similarly, children will not have access to free immunisations and health surveillance. </p> <p>It is also likely the proposals will lead to asylum seekers whose claims are still being considered and members of established ethnic-minority communities facing difficulties. Some healthcare providers have already misunderstood and anticipated changes and there have been cases of \"non-failed\" asylum seekers being refused hospital, GP or dental care to which they are entitled. </p> <p>We believe that these proposals have no evidence base and, if implemented, will lead to inhuman treatment of some of the most vulnerable and excluded members of society. They will ethically compromise health workers. They will lead to chaos in the surgery, will be a threat to public health and will lead to discrimination against other ethnic minorities.

  "<p>In one of Najaf's oldest religious schools there were no classes to attend nor turbaned clerics to teach. Instead the old building, a few yards away from the main Imam Ali mosque, had been converted into a makeshift hospital and morgue. </p> <p>In the hands of clerics, books and prayer beads had been replaced by AK-47 assault rifles. Wounded fighters lay on the floor, some with their backs against the walls. In one corner there was a pile of used, bloodied bandages, stretchers and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. </p> <p>The transformation was the result of an intense three-day firefight between the Shia militia loyal to the rebel cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and the US marines, the worst violence in Iraq for months. </p> <p>Soon the wounded were evacuated to the rear lines and only the dead were left: nine bodies wrapped in blankets. </p> <p>\"Look,\" said the man running the hospital, \"these are happy martyrs.\" </p> <p>Most of the corpses had parts of their heads blown off, one was missing the upper left part of his torso and his skull. In Islamic tradition martyrs are buried exactly as they died, with the blood and the dirt from the battlefield covering them. It is believed there is nothing more pure than the blood of the martyrs. </p> <p>All who entered the makeshift morgue looked at them with passion, as if this was something to be aspired to. </p> <p>When one of the bodies was unwrapped, a fighter cried out: \"Oh God, when did he die? We were together yesterday.\" </p> <p>\"Don't say that,\" said another. \"He is the fortunate one. We are all here for that.\" </p> <p>The injuries to the dead said a lot about the precision of American snipers, but there was more argument over the precision of their counting. </p> <p>While the Americans claimed 300 of the Mahdi army had been killed, no more than a dozen wounded and the nine dead were to be seen. </p> <p>\"If they had killed 300 that means we have at least another 1,000 injured,\" said Ahmad al-Shaibani, the militia's leading commander. \"How many fighters do they think we have?\" </p> <p>In the streets and the alleyways around the holy shrine of Imam Ali, hundreds of armed gunmen carrying all sorts of weapons, rocket launchers, AK-47s and even old rusted daggers, roamed. </p> <p>The sky was obscured by a thick layer of smoke, the air filled with the sounds of explosions and the crackle of machine guns, only interrupted by the occasional blasts of missiles. Every few hours the frontlines shifted. </p> <p>The militiamen would go to the outskirts of the old town, fire a couple of mortars and RPG rounds, cheer for a few seconds and withdraw before the US forces could single them out. </p> <p>The accounts of these attacks varied from one militiaman to another. Some would swear they had seen five burning US tanks, others would say 11, but most of the civilian casualties in the local hospitals had been hit by stray mortar shells. </p> <p>Mr Shaibani, a cleric in his early 30s, originally from the impoverished southern town of Nassiriya, sat in a narrow alleyway not far from the centre. On a normal day he would be in charge of Mr Sadr's sharia court. </p> <p>On this day he was more like a guerrilla fighter with oversized brown shades and a small mobile phone in which he was getting reports from the frontlines. He was surrounded by his platoon, a dozen or so men, of different ages and from different towns and cities. Some from Basra; others from the Shia slums around Baghdad. All were here to fight the Americans. </p> <p>\"I will fight them even with my bare hands,\" said one. </p> <p>The exhausted men were taking shelter in a half-ruined small mud house. Sitting on a dirt courtyard, they had a few pieces of dried bread to share between them, when someone arrived with two buckets of water. \"I found a water tank in the end of the street,\" the man said. </p> <p>\"They are trying to besiege us. The mayor has cut the water supplies and electricity,\" Mr Shaibani said. </p> <p>But his men had more reason to celebrate as they showed off a machine gun a young fighter had brought from an American Humvee he claimed had been destroyed by an RPG. </p> <p>\"We are more organised this time than we were in May,\" said Mr Shaibani, referring to the first major Shia uprising against the Americans this year. </p> <p>The next day Najaf was calmer, the sounds of the shelling more distant. </p> <p>But in the main souk the scene was quite different.The wholesale food market, the size of a football pitch, had been reduced to a pile of warped metal. Everything had been incinerated, and each part of the market reeked with its own stench. The smell of burnt potatoes, figs and grapes marked the vegetables section. The cereals were still burning, giving off a faint smell of overcooked rice, and all around was an overwhelming odour of burnt plastic and the crackle of exploding Pepsi cans. </p> <p>Dozens of men, merchants and workers were trying to rescue what they could. </p> <p>From the carnage appeared a militiaman wrapped in the Iraqi flag followed by two of his comrades. The trio were trying to stop looters digging into the incinerated merchandise. </p> <p>\"The Americans couldn't retrieve their casualties from market so they decided to burn it all,\" said the man with flag as he led the way into the market. </p> <p>\"Don't trust what some of the people say, there are lots of enemies here.\" </p> <p>For the local Najafis, whether they were merchants or workers, the blame was directed in a more coded way. </p> <p>\"We don't know who did this, the Americans or the Mahdi army,\" said Abbas Fadl, 29, the owner of a juice shop. </p> <p>\"Saddam took my father and now the Americans took my job away,\" said his brother Firas. \"The Mahdi army and the Americans want to fight and we, the poor people, are caught in the middle.\" </p> <p>Later, around the shrine, the Mahdi army militia were celebrating, chanting and spitting on the corpse of an Iraqi national guardsman. </p> <p>\"This is the fate of the American agents,\" one shouted. </p> <p>Later the body was taken away and put on public display by the gate of the militia headquarters. </p> <p>A man approached and asked: \"Is this an Iraqi?\" Yes, I told him. He shook his head and walked away.</p>",
  "The oil-well troubleshooter Paul N \"Red\" Adair, who has died aged 89, was a swashbuckling 20th-century hero, portrayed fittingly on screen by John Wayne, and he probably did more than any other person single-handedly to preserve the environment. The fires he extinguished were so enormous that they threatened to be dangerous contributors to global warming, or the potential causes of intercontinental air pollution disasters. <p>His greatest feat came when he was in his seventies - confronting 117 gigantic oil-well infernos that dominated the horizon in Kuwait, the legacy of Saddam Hussein's departing Iraqi troops after the first Gulf war. Adair and his crews finished putting out the fires in nine months, as opposed to the five years first envisaged, without a single casualty, and indeed the 5ft 7in boss maintained that none of his employees had ever suffered a serious injury while firefighting. </p> <p>As well as a charismatic risk taker, Adair was an astute businessman, creating various enterprises throughout his life. As well as pioneering semi-submersible firefighting vessels and the design of oil derricks deployed in the North Sea, he also contributed to the technical advancement of various marine firefighting boats and water guns. </p> <p>Born in the American oil capital of Houston, Texas, as soon as he could toddle, he witnessed the power of fire in the workshop of his blacksmith father, Charles. But it was a large, poor family, and young Red - so nicknamed for the colour of his hair - left Reagan high school early to take on various jobs before joining the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1936. </p> <p>Two years later he got his first oil job, for the Otis Pressure Control Co in the fields around Houston. Here he learned from the bottom up the skills of extracting \"black gold\" from the earth. When the US joined the war after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Adair served in the 139th Bomb Disposal Squad, and rose to staff sergeant. His work on unexploded shells and bombs in Japan taught him two skills that would serve him well later: how to utilise and control explosives safely, and how to keep a cool head under extreme pressure and danger. </p> <p>He returned to Houston after the war and went to work with Myron Kinley, who had established the techniques of oil-well blowout and fire control. He stayed with Kinley for 14 years before forming his own Red Adair Co, where he perfected the methods for controlling \"wild wells\". At the same time, he developed a flamboyant public persona, capitalising on his nickname with bright red firefighting uniforms and helmets, a red logo, and red accoutrements, replicas of which he would later sell to fans. </p> <p>He and his crews were soon averaging 42 fires a year, extinguished or controlled, all over the world, inland and at sea. The Adair teams completed more than 1,000 assignments internationally through using explosives and drilling mud and concrete. In 1968 the film Hellfighters came out, with Wayne starring as Adair. </p> <p>Adair scored numerous firsts in conquering oil-well fires, including capping the first US land well, extinguishing an underwater wild well, and a fire on a large vessel at sea. He got big press coverage for the Catco offshore fire (1959), the \"Devil's Cigarette Lighter\" in the Sahara desert (1962), a massive offshore blaze in the Bay Marchand field off the Louisiana coast (1970), the Bravo blowout in the North Sea (1977), the Ixtoc blowout in the Gulf of Mexico (1979), and the Piper Alpha disaster in the North Sea (1988), after an explosion had killed 167 oil workers. </p> <p>When Adair arrived in Kuwait in early March 1991, there were fires everywhere. Thick black smoke made it impossible to get any sense of direction. Adair and his teams were housed in ransacked buildings, but most serious was a lack of equipment - and water. </p> <p>He decided to exploit pipelines used to carry oil from stations in the oilfields to the Persian Gulf. These would be reversed to carry salt water from the Gulf back to fight the fires, a plan that required pumping the 1.5bn gallons of water that were eventually used. Adair had to fly to Washington in June to testify in order to get his equipment. With his flair for showmanship, he showed a dramatic slide presentation, explaining that extinguishing a fire is not the most difficult part. What happens afterwards is the most dangerous, because while the well is still blowing it can flash and reignite, killing the crew on top of it. </p> <p>Adair met President George Bush the following day to express his concerns, and got a pledge of support. By early July, the equipment began rolling into Kuwait, and by November the Emir of Kuwait ceremoniously extinguished the last fire. </p> <p>Adair retired when he sold his company in 1994. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Kemmie, daughter Robyn and son Jimmy. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Paul Neal (Red) Adair, firefighter, born June 18 1915; died August 7 2004</p>",
  "Four men have been arrested after the murder of six people in Florida in an apparent dispute over some stolen clothes and a video games console. <p>The men, aged between 18 and 27, allegedly killed their victims with aluminium baseball bats. The beatings were so savage that one of the victims, a woman believed to be about 22, has still not been identified. </p> <p>Ben Johnson, the sheriff in Volusia county where the murders took place, said the level of violence was indescribable. \"This was the worst thing I have seen in my career,\" he said. </p> <p>The victims, four men and two women, were found on Friday morning in different rooms in a rented house in Deltona, about 25 miles north of Orlando. The house was said to have been drenched in blood. </p> <p>Although all of the victims sustained knife wounds during the attack, autopsies concluded that it was the force of the baseball bats that caused all six deaths. </p> <p>The bodies were discovered after one victim's colleague at a fast food restaurant called a friend and asked the person to visit the house because the co-worker had failed to turn up for work. </p> <p>The suspects' leader, Troy Victorino, 27, is alleged to have recruited the three 18-year-olds, Robert Cannon, Jerone Hunter and Michael Salas, to seek revenge for the suspected theft of his property. Police said the three younger men had all confessed to taking part in the deadly spree. All four have been charged with first-degree murder and armed burglary. </p> <p>The five victims identified so far are Michelle Ann Nathan, 19; Anthony Vega, 34; Robert \"Tito\" Gonzalez, 28; Francisco Ayo Roman, 30; and Jonathan Gleason, 18. </p> <p>Mr Victorino had recently become involved in a feud with one of the victims, whom he blamed for the theft of his property. His clothes and games console were supposedly stolen while he spent three days in prison for assault in July. Police said he was overheard vowing to get revenge. </p> <p>\"These cruel murders have brought senseless and unspeakable tragedy to six innocent families,\" Mr Johnson said. </p> <p>The killings were the worst in the state since 1990 when a man whose car was repossessed shot eight people in a Jacksonville loan office before turning the gun on himself.</p>",
  "<p>Few television events are as memorable as a big Olympic games moment. Whether it's the good (Steve Redgrave rowing to gold in Sydney), the bad (Zola Budd tripping up Mary Decker in Los Angeles) or the ugly (Ben Johnson's drug-fuelled dash in Seoul), every games throws up at least one moment that will be replayed ad infinitum. </p> <p>But at the end of a long summer of sport, with storm clouds gathering over the insidious problem of drugs and a paucity of British medal hopes, the 2004 games faces a bigger battle than ever to compete with the ubiquity of football. A glance through the sports pages over the past few weeks confirms the extent of the challenge - acres of newsprint devoted to the shambolic goings on at the Football Association, plenty of pre-season transfer tittle-tattle and nary a mention of the upcoming games. The apathy is mirrored on the ground in Athens. Following the euphoria over Greece's unexpected Euro 2004 triumph, ticket sales for the Olympics have been slow. </p> <p>BBC director of sport Peter Salmon admits it is a tussle that is hard to win. \"It's a battle to keep football in check. Football has eclipsed everything. It's only the Olympics that can punch its weight and provide a window for those other sports,\" he argues. \"It's an ongoing struggle. Arguably, the Olympic movement is more embattled than ever.\" </p> <p>But Salmon remains equally convinced that the huge commitment from broadcasters around the world, which collectively spend billions on covering the games, is not only justified but essential. \"It tunes in perfectly with that public service spirit. Truly global sporting events are the closest you get to something religious or spiritual in an increasingly secular world,\" he insists. In line with this crusading ethos, he believes that the corporation has a duty to licence fee payers to bring the games to as wide an audience as possible. \"The public would be scandalised if the BBC didn't support the Olympics.\" </p> <p>As Kylie Minogue was prancing on a giant flip-flop to bring the curtain down on the successful Sydney Olympics four years ago, the thoughts of Martin Hopkins, veteran executive producer of the BBC's coverage, were already turning to this summer's event in Athens. \"Planning starts as soon as the last one finishes. It's a gradual process, about what changes you're making from the last one. Technology is moving along and you're trying to keep up with it,\" says Hopkins, who will retire after the Athens games, having worked on every Olympics since 1968. </p> <p>For Hopkins, the games, which begin on Friday, represent the culmination of four years' hard work. And for the corporation in general, the Olympics are not only a huge opportunity but also a big gamble. BBC Sport is devoting more airtime and resources than ever before to covering events in Athens. Over 1,250 hours of coverage across BBC1, BBC2 and its interactive digital channels, along with groundbreaking live footage over broadband, will mean little escape for viewers. </p> <p>Steve Rider, the BBC presenter who will be the main face of its Olympics output, insists that it is the scale of the corporation's coverage that provides the opportunity to uncover the unlikely heroes that characterise a successful games. </p> <p>\"When you put the tag Olympic games at the end and there's a gold medal on offer, everybody suddenly becomes an expert and gets interested,\" said Rider, who has worked on five Olympics. \"Who'd have thought curling would be such a big hit in Salt Lake City or that we'd get seven million viewers staying up until 1am to watch the rowing in Sydney?\" </p> <p>The new interactive element, which will provide live coverage of four extra sports in addition to the main BBC1 and BBC2 action, offers a massive opportunity to bring even more sports to public prominence. \"What we do is provide a comprehensiveness that sucks people in and drives millions of people to quite specialist sports,\" says Salmon. But he adds that British sports bodies must maintain their side of the bargain to capitalise on the shop window offered by the Olympics. \"The problem afterwards for British sport is that it doesn't have the tactical awareness to grab people's imagination. We're always looking to start new partnerships and look for the next sport to break through,\" he says. </p> <p>Dave Gordon, head of major events at BBC Sport and editorially responsible for the coverage from Athens, also believes that reports of the death of the Olympics have been exaggerated. \"There's still a great enthusiasm for the Olympics. It's the ultimate in sport. No TV station is doing any more than we're doing and we're maximising the rights we have.\" </p> <p>Both Gordon and Hopkins are enthusiastic about the possibilities offered by the interactive broadcasts, through which fans of minority sports will be able to watch, say, baseball or gymnastics for hours on end. \"The thing about the Olympics is that it generates 3,500 hours of television and up to now we've only been able to scratch the surface. It's a wonderful facility to have and I'm looking forward to seeing how the British public take to it,\" says Gordon. </p> <p>The importance that the BBC places on the games also ties in with the seismic shift in the TV sports landscape over the past decade. Following the initial shock when BSkyB began outbidding the BBC for every event going, the two have settled down into a kind of equilibrium. Sky has cornered the market, and driven innovation, in sporting events that drive pay-TV subscriptions - such Premier League and Champions League football. Meanwhile, under Salmon and former director general Greg Dyke, the BBC has carefully cultivated an image as the place where the nation comes together for the one-off events like Wimbledon, the World Cup and the Olympics. </p> <p>Appropriately enough, given the host country, much remains in the lap of the gods. An early British gold, an unexpected boost for a hitherto minority sport or even a major scandal could provide the spark that makes it a games to remember. \"The ideal is a British gold on the first day, closely followed by a Greek gold,\" says Hopkins. \"What we're hoping for is lots of those watercooler moments,\" confirms Gordon. </p> <p>Salmon believes that the Olympics needs the BBC, and other free-to-air broadcasters around the world, as much as the BBC needs the games. \"They realised that the quickest death for the Olympics would be to forge a relationship with a pay-TV operator. It would quickly dwindle into obscurity,\" he says, explaining the International Olympic Committee's recent decision to award the rights to the next two Olympics to the European Broadcasting Union, the coalition of free-to-air broadcasters of which the BBC is a member. \"I didn't lose any sleep over it. They recognise the value we bring. Otherwise it would be picked off by various commercial interests and most of the 20-plus sports would be ignored.\" </p> <p>He hopes that the strength of this symbiotic relationship will continue to be enough to fuel public interest in the games despite the challenges it faces. The corporation refuses to say how much it costs to cover the two-week event, but industry insiders estimate it at around \u00a312m, on top of the cost of the rights. Given that, and the fact that the schedules will be dominated by the games for two weeks, can it really justify the cost if public interest wanes? Salmon believes so, and emphatically. </p> <p>\"It's summer, there's not a lot on. People are looking for something special. It's a massive event that brings people together and if you opt out you're kind of opting out of society. Bring on the drama.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Digital technology means that several British newspapers, including the Guardian and the Observer, will be printing editions in Athens during the Olympic games. </p> <p>The technology means small runs are viable, negating the need for the production of plates from which pages are printed. Print firm Oc\u00e9 claims to be able to print anything from one to 10,000 copies. </p> <p>The Telegraph and FT are also involved, along with other papers from around the world.</p>",
  "This month, Channel 4 will finally screen Edge of the City, its controversial documentary depicting the bleak realities of life in the most deprived parts of Bradford. The film was originally due to go out in May, but hours before transmission it was pulled from the schedules, after it was advertised on the British National Party website as a \"party political broadcast\", and the chief constable of West Yorkshire warned that its screening could provoke community disorder in the run-up to the local and European elections. <p>The controversy centred on the film's claims that men - most of them British Asians - in Bradford and neighbouring Keighley were grooming under-age white schoolgirls for sex. At the eye of the storm was the film's producer and director, Anna Hall. </p> <p>Hall's initial idea, she explains, was to make an observational documentary focusing on the daily lives of social workers. \"Unlike doctors, fire-fighters, the police and other frontline services,\" she says, \"there have been few films about social workers. The only time you hear about them is when things go wrong; you never hear what they do the rest of the time.\" </p> <p>The choice of Bradford as a location, she says, was purely practical; the company she was working for, Chameleon TV, was based in Leeds, and wanted to feature a northern city. Bradford social services, which receives around 48,000 requests for help in a year, was the first department to agree to take part. </p> <p>After talking to over 40 teams from Bradford social services, dealing with all kinds of clients, from adults with physical disabilities to children in respite care, Hall decided to focus on the four cases we see in the film: Caroline and Keith, a disabled couple, who have had to move eight times in eight years to escape harassment from local children; Matthew, a white teenager with 96 offences to his name, who turns a corner after working with Omar, a trainee social worker, and falling in love with Malika, a mixed-race girl; Eric, an 83-year-old pensioner, who wants to maintain his independence; and two white mothers who allege that their young teenage daughters have been groomed and sexually abused. </p> <p>The explosive grooming story nearly didn't make the shortlist. Hall had already filmed several other stories through the children's department which she was unable to screen for legal reasons. \"We weren't looking for this issue,\" she says. \"It just kept surfacing. Social workers said, 'You can't do that story because it's too difficult.' What did they mean by 'too difficult'? Too racially sensitive?\" </p> <p>The social workers she spoke to were appalled and frustrated, but also frightened of becoming targets of violence if they spoke out publicly, as were the mothers she spoke to. Hall decided to confront these difficulties and work with two mothers whose anonymity she promised to preserve. </p> <p>What emerges from these women's account, and from the testimony of two girls, one of them currently being groomed, is disturbing. Men from Bradford's Asian community, they claim, are targeting girls from 11 or 12 years up, taking them out in their cars, and giving them alcohol and gifts. The girls are flattered into believing that the men love them. Subsequently, they might be given heroin and crack cocaine and date-rape drugs, raped vaginally and anally, and in some cases, abducted and gang-raped. </p> <p>According to Hall's film, the Keighley social services office has recorded 50 to 70 possible cases of grooming, while the children's charity Barnardo's currently has 15 projects working with young people across the UK who have been abused. But what struck Hall about the cases she found in Bradford and Keighley was that \"blatant abuse was going on under people's noses, and no one seemed able to prevent it\". </p> <p>Prevention and cure are both difficult. Where the girls are over 13, police are unable to act unless they themselves make a complaint. Many of the girls either do not think they are being abused, or have been so heavily drugged that they cannot recall clearly what has happened, or are intimidated by what will happen to them and their families if they do speak out. Hall's hope was that the film would convey the sense of outrage felt by the victims' families and by social workers, and that this might lead to changes in the law and dedicated policing nationwide. </p> <p>Then the BNP hijacked the issue. Channel 4 called Hall to say that an advert for the film had appeared on the BNP's website, describing it as a \"party political broadcast\" on their behalf. \"I felt numb,\" Hall says. \"The BNP had never even seen a single frame of the film.\" </p> <p>Groups such as Unite Against Fascism, the 1990 Trust, and the National Assembly Against Racism began to flood Channel 4 with requests to delay transmission. The Chief Constable of West Yorkshire, Colin Cramphorn, joined the call, and Channel 4 complied. Both the police and Channel 4 stressed that the issue was the timing, so close to local and European elections. The mainstream press were quick to respond, accusing Channel 4 variously of naive scheduling, of handing a political coup to the BNP, of being politically motivated in withdrawing the film, of cravenness, and of self-censorship. </p> <p>At the time, the BNP was campaigning for 10 seats across Bradford, including Keighley, where much of the grooming story was filmed. After the film was pulled, the BNP claimed that they were the only British political party to address the problem of grooming. In fact, the Labour MP for Keighley, Ann Cryer, has been working on behalf of parents and victims for some time now. </p> <p>\"It infuriates me when the racists of the BNP try to hijack this issue,\" Cryer says. \"They do nothing to try and alleviate the problem while many of us are working hard to engineer real solutions.\" Khadim Hussain, district councillor for Keighley Central, agrees. \"People were very angry,\" he says, \"because the BNP simply used the problem to get publicity for themselves\". </p> <p>The BNP subsequently gained four seats on Bradford district council in the May local elections. But, says Hall, three months on: \"I'm really upset that the film has been read as a slur on the Asian community. This is not a film made by a far-right racist. It was made by someone who likes human beings.\" After two years of hard work, the experience was shattering. \"When your film is reduced to 'BNP Sex Row Film', as one headline had it, you feel pretty depressed,\" she says. \"The story was misrepresented by both camps; the far right claimed it as political propaganda, while leftwing pressure groups contended that I was clearly racist.\" Hall vehemently rejects both views. </p> <p>But for Hall and her team, and for the people she filmed, the worst thing about the BNP's intervention was that it made the real issues even harder to address. \"I felt that the story of these mothers and their horrendous plight over the last three years was not worthy of a disgusting hijack by the BNP,\" says Hall. \"I felt awful for the mothers who were accused of being BNP activists, which was 100% inaccurate. This slander was the last thing they needed, given all they've been through.\" One of the mothers featured in the film sent Hall a text message after the film was withdrawn, which read, \"It's a real shame when votes come before young girls' lives.\" </p> <p>In Bradford, things are starting to change. Since August 2003, 11 people - 10 men and one woman, white and Asian - have been charged with offences ranging from rape to indecent assault, witness intimidation, abduction and threats to kill. Three police protection orders have been taken out in relation to girls about whom social services have particular concerns. Bradford social services, together with Barnardo's and other agencies, are educating schoolgirls about the dangers of grooming. </p> <p>Alison O'Sullivan, director of social services in Bradford, believes that the children's bill currently passing through parliament will help to put the multi-agency approach to the problem of grooming on a statutory footing. Nationwide, the criminal justice bill will, for the first time, ensure that hearsay evidence is admissible in such cases, and the sexual offences bill makes the grooming of a child a criminal offence in its own right. </p> <p>A spokeswoman from the West Yorkshire police says, \"In the case of alleged sexual exploitation of young women in Keighley, social services and the police have been conducting extensive enquiries for the last two years. A number of girls have been interviewed, aged mainly between 13 and 16. We have found no evidence of systematic exploitation. Some of the girls admitted having relationships with older men but they described them as their boyfriends and did not feel they were being exploited.\" </p> <p>Hall is unconvinced that the situation has improved: some of the mothers she spoke to have told her their daughters are still being approached. </p> <p>What the documentary does not make clear is how the Asian community in Bradford has responded to, or is addressing, the problem of grooming. Hall had hoped to feature a Pakistani woman she met who was challenging the men involved directly. \"She was inspiring and courageous,\" Hall says, but in the end she was unable to appear, for personal reasons unconnected with the documentary. </p> <p>Khadim Hussain says that community leaders in Keighley are now working with the police and social services to tackle the problem. \"Criminals are criminals,\" he says, \"and should be punished.\" In an article for the Eastern Eye, Omar Sheikh, the social worker featured in Hall's documentary, comments on the need for better community leadership: \"Mosques could play a far greater role than at present, providing a positive role model,\" he suggests. \"We need people with more impact than the police, who are just seen as the enemy. We need passionate community leaders who can play a bigger role in influencing the younger generation.\" </p> <p>While she acknowledges that the authorities have made some progress in tackling the issue, Hall feels that there is still room for improvement: \"One of the continual frustrations of the social workers I came across was that year-round policing on this issue is shaky, and interpretation of the law varies locally.\" One police officer in the film is seen explaining that, unlike burglary, child protection is not a police national target. Hall believes that the Home Office needs to put child protection on its national \"strategic priority\" list, in order to ensure that police can allocate the necessary resources to the problem. </p> <p>Other factors in police and public reluctance to deal with grooming are more subtle; a senior Bradford child protection officer suggests that the problem is one not of race or culture, but of misogyny; there is the insidious idea that the girls are \"trash\" and that it is acceptable to use them for sex. \"We cannot censor this issue,\" Hall says. \"As a whole society, we need to say that we find these crimes unacceptable and are determined to deal with them.\" </p> <p>Now that the documentary is to be screened, Hall hopes that people will see that its purpose is to foster compassion - compassion for the victims of serious crime, but compassion also for those people we prefer not to see; those who are odd, who do antisocial things, and who sometimes collude in their own misery. </p> <p>The film portrays people who might more often be characterised as \"neighbours from hell\" with dignity and respect, and makes us sympathise with them. Keith, for example, first seen drunk and incoherent as his partner talks about how he tried to suffocate her, is later seen in tears, blaming himself for his own harass ment because he is \"disabled and backward and thick\". </p> <p>Our preconceived notions about social workers are also challenged, as we see them struggling against the odds to make a difference to their clients' lives - grappling with multi-layered problems, held back by bureaucracy, lack of resources, their clients' unwillingness to cooperate, and sometimes even the law. </p> <p>The irony that a film intended to confront stereotypes has been used as political propaganda by the BNP is not lost on Hall, but she remains determined that it should be seen: \"I hope that people will take the film in its entirety and have their preconceptions challenged.\" </p> <p>In his report following the Bradford riots in 2001, the former commissioner for racial equality, Sir Herman Ouseley, recommended that the city face up to its problems and not be afraid of them. Three years on, Edge of the City and the controversy surrounding it illustrate just how difficult this is. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Edge of the City will be broadcast on Channel 4 on August 26 at 9pm.</p>",
  "<p>Friday's show was typically eclectic for <strong>Victoria Derbyshire</strong> (Five Live). The subjects covered in her fifth morning in the phone-in slot included the shenanigans at the FA, weddings, wasps, robots, terror threats, Iraq and Big Brother. Derbyshire took the mix very much in her stride.</p> <p>Like Julian Worricker, and the rather more lively Sonia Deol in the same slot over on the BBC Asian Network, Derbyshire has the knack of stealthily easing people into talking. You noticed this most in the discussion of weddings, with people happily revealing the tangles of their marriages and the significant moments in their courtships. One caller touchingly recalled how he'd met his bride-to-be \"on a rather dreary night in November\". Derbyshire asks questions and sounds genuinely interested in the answers (my favourite, on Friday, was to a wasp buff: \"So, what was it about wasps?\"), but she also adds an edge to the empathetic, chummy style which so suits the slot. When a guest queried whether a woman could possibly have arranged her wedding so as not to clash with a football fixture, Derbyshire - herself a keen football fan - snapped \"'women do like football' shock\" quickly, and not quite under her breath. </p> <p>She was at her strongest when interviewing Gary Teeley, the first Briton to be kidnapped in Iraq. It was a compassionate interview, studded with pauses from Teeley as he recalled the terror of capture. Interestingly, once he got to talking about his release, the faltering disappeared and he relished telling how his first question when free was about how West Ham had fared in a play-off. \"I can't believe you just asked that,\" his mother-in-law said. \"I can't believe you don't know the answer,\" he replied. Derbyshire, perhaps relieved that the interview was now galloping to its close, roared with laughter.</p> <p>Buck 65, a rural rapper from smalltown Nova Scotia, has more than 20,000 records in his collection, he told <strong>Andy Kershaw</strong> (Radio 3) last night. Having listened to his dark, gravelly music, I don't imagine that there's much chirpy throwaway pop in there. His songs have titles such as Wicked and Weird, his lyrics include observations in petrol stations (\"fill her up with regular, I need to take a piss\") and a typical chorus goes: \"It's a piece of crap\" (refrain).</p> <p>On Saturday evening, you might have thought you were listening to the story of The Buzzcocks, engagingly told by Mark Lamarr. You weren't. It was the story of <strong>Buzzcocks</strong> (Radio 2). These tiny details matter, Paul Morley explained at some length. \"The very delicate nature of the lack of a definite article was a very symbolic thing,\" he mooted. \"It didn't need the 'the', because the 'the' is a traditional motif.\" Right.</p>",
  "<p>OK, so you're tired, in a hotel room and watching Kiefer Sutherland sweat manfully through a repeat of the repeat of the pre-pre-penultimate episode of 24 Series Whocares. Kiefer's doing his agoodmandriventoofar face and the suspect is saying, \"But you can't do this!\" - referring to keeping her in a designer basement and talking to her REALLY SERIOUSLY - and then, well you have an itsy bitsy epiphany, don't you? </p> <p>I did, anyway - a tearing sensation inside the back of my neck as entertainment and reality parted in a terminal way. Not that I ever thought US cop shows were real. The Rockford Files and Columbo are watchable because they're unreal. But the modern shows sell \"ripped from the headlines\" realism, technical research, contemporary resonance. </p> <p>So what the hell is Kiefer Sutherland up to? Where's that vital, Sibel Edmonds whistle-blowing touch? Why isn't his agency full of drug dealers? Why isn't his intel coming from pointy-headed werewolves in the White House, spies and dodgy mercenaries? Kevin Taskesen was a Turkish translator for the FBI when his only qualification was being married to an exam administrator - he ended up \"translating\" for all Turkic language detainees in Guant\u00e1namo Bay - that's the kind of wacky detail I could warm to in a drama. </p> <p>\"Hey, Kevin, when's the next Evil Muslim Outrage planned - they tell ya? Yo, Kevin? Can y'all understand me, at all? Aw, shucks - just move to Orange alert - keep that electorate twitchy.\" Did you know Gitmo now boasts a navy spokesman called Lieutenant Mike Kafka? That's an irony-free miniseries, all by itself. </p> <p>And then there's the hugely popular Law &amp; Order - the TV franchise, not the con cept, obviously. Its next incarnation was slated to be Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury, but this seems to have been delayed - I hope because they're now going with Law &amp; Order: Trial by Ordeal, where hopelessly unchristian suspects enjoy intense experiences in Egypt or - better yet - in an exciting freelance prison run by a madcap gang of charming former green berets in Afghanistan. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Sam Waterston can get in some ace legal wrangling back in the States - \"There are different types of habeas corpus - pretend and meaningful: meaningful habeas corpus applies to people who are fully human, like you and me and Condoleezza Rice.\" He can explain why military courts need only \"reason to believe\" that someone is a hell-spawned terrorist before they can tuck him or her away indefinitely. \"It's like the Spanish Inquisition, but with slightly lower standards of evidence.\" </p> <p>Not that US citizens have to worry about becoming ghost prisoners, unless reclassified as enemy combatants. Americans just have to avoid their own prison system: the US has around 5% of the world's population but 25% of its prisoners, and one in 75 American men are currently banged up - but still the prison scenes in US police dramas lack the tang of genuine penitentiaries - no one is hooded with urine-soaked bags, strapped naked to chairs for hours, sodomised, traded for favours or routinely doused with pepper spray and beaten in filthy cells. Vincent D'Onofrio doesn't get to act a lot in Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent when noting that many convictions carry an additional penalty of rape and HIV infection, that 70% of prisoners are non-Caucasian and that death row makes the Klan look liberal. He doesn't ask why plea bargaining and unsound convictions mean an alarming percentage of inmates in America's run-for-profit prisons are innocent, or ponder on Abu Ghraib as a reflection of standard US prison policy. </p> <p>Detective Munch doesn't get all wiggy in Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit and suddenly ask why 130 US jurists could declare the White House torture memos \"seek to circumvent long established and universally acknowledged principles of law and common decency\". And he won't mention that George Bush has granted himself very literal new powers of life and death. That's Bush the former drug addict, now reportedly taking powerful anti-depressants and displaying depression and paranoia. </p> <p>Still, what I'm really waiting for is that perfect episode of CSI, my favourite. Investigator Grissom stands too close to sexy investigator Sidle as they examine the body of an unknown Muslim. Grissom, soft-voiced and precise, observes: \"These boot marks and abrasions - if the perpetrators didn't know they would cause him distress, or kill him, they can't be blamed. So we can ignore them. This anal trauma: that's where they inserted the Christianity - it's the only way a Muslim can absorb it, so really, they were trying to save him. Hey, Sarah, let's skip this, get naked, pile him up with others and take some pics. Come on, we can say we were following orders. That makes everything OK.\" </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It was hardly a surprise when the Football Association last week accepted the resignation of Colin Gibson, its hapless director of communications. The public exposure of his key part in briefing against the England manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson, guaranteed his departure. </p> <p>As so many journalists have been quick to point out, Gibson had been adjudged guilty of both naivety and mendacity, a combination which had irreparably damaged his credibility. How could anyone, employers or reporters, trust him again? </p> <p>That said, there has been a measure of sympathy for Gibson from a number of journalists and especially from several public relations practitioners who murmured to themselves, \"there, but for the grace of God, go I\". </p> <p>I certainly have no intention of putting the boot into Gibson (who, in his previous incarnation as Daily Mail sports editor, was always courteous and helpful to me), but his extraordinary case does raise interesting questions about the nature of the relationship between PRs and the media, providing a rare insight into how modern journalism operates. </p> <p>Let's consider first what Gibson did, taking into account the fact that he has yet to reveal the exact circumstances which led him to take the News of the World into his confidence over a story which, by tabloid standards, was a red-hot issue. </p> <p>Was it his own idea to do a deal with the paper in order to cover up for his boss, FA chief executive Mark Palios? Did he decide to stitch up Eriksson by leaking details of his affair with an FA secretary, Faria Alam, in return for the NoW hushing up Palios's fling with the same woman? Or, as seems more likely, was Gibson put under pressure from Palios to do the deal? It is all very well to say that Gibson should have resisted the pressure - as hindsight tells us, and him, he should - but we do not know the implications for Gibson if he had refused. For example, was his job on the line? Was he thinking of his mortgage? Had he, most importantly, brokered similar deals in the past and got away with them? </p> <p>Many PRs, probably the vast majority, believe that what Gibson did was irredeemably reprehensible. Julia Hobsbawm, professor of public relations at the London College of Communication, who also heads her own PR agency, thinks such dealmaking is \"morally reprehensible\". </p> <p>While \"vaguely sympathetic\" to Gibson's personal dilemma, she argues that, in general, the attempt by PRs to try to control or wilfully manipulate information \"is both wrong and stupid\". </p> <p>Ethically wrong because it involves concealing the truth. Practically stupid because, sooner or later, that truth is likely to emerge. </p> <p>But Hobsbawm is experienced enough to know that deals between PRs and journalists are common and, in many ways, do not compromise either side. This is particularly true of the celebrity world where PRs are often able to exercise considerable power. </p> <p>When I was assistant editor at the Sun, I accepted the situation without demur. Yes, said a PR on one occasion, I might get you an interview with the boys of Wham! as long as, first, you run a feature on an up-and-coming hairdresser to the stars. No way. OK, then, how about my new band, Japan? That kind of haggling was, and is, routine. </p> <p>Behind-the-scenes dealmaking takes many forms. Tabloid kiss-and-tell victims often bow to their fate by agreeing not to sue or confessing their sins in return for some of the revelations being toned down or omitted altogether. Complex, confidential deals are regularly negotiated between newspapers and publishers prior to book serialisations. </p> <p>Celebrity interviews are often granted only as long as the journalist agrees not to ask certain questions; many demand a list of questions in advance. Reporters and their sources routinely agree during their conversations what will and will not be \"on the record\". </p> <p>PRs who represent celebrities are expected by their clients to do deals on their behalf, either to keep certain matters out of papers or, at least, to spin stories in as positive a way as possible. Damage limitation inevitably means that agents must enter into bargains. </p> <p>No one has surpassed Max Clifford in this artful practice because he understands better than anyone else what is achievable. He is honest with his clients and knows how far he can push papers. It is inconceivable that he could have made the same mistake as Gibson. </p> <p>But Clifford also has the advantage of power, as tabloid editors know well. If he withholds his favour from a certain paper, as he has done on occasions in the past, opportunities for exclusives vanish. The truth is that dealmaking is so much part of the accepted journalistic culture that it raises no eyebrows. So why was Gibson's deal with an unnamed \"senior NoW executive\" so different? </p> <p>There appear to be two overlapping reasons: firstly, according to the taped transcript run in the NoW, he did not appear to have sealed a conclusive gagging deal before leaking controversial material about Eriksson. Secondly, he was attempting to prevent a matter germane to the whole story - the FA's own duplicity and double standards - from being made public. That is why it would be wrong to condemn the NoW in spite of the paper outing Gibson as its source. It would have been irresponsible for the NoW to conceal what amounted to a shabby deal. </p> <p>But none of the above, which relates to the mechanics and ethics of Gibson's behaviour in this specific instance, should blind us to the wholly intrusive nature of the tabloid agenda which lies at the heart of the whole sordid saga. It is blindingly obvious that if the press were not consumed with Eriksson's domestic life none of this would have happened. </p> <p>What he and Palios do in their private lives should be their own affair and, if the FA had acted in a principled and sensible manner from the outset by stating that, both on and off the record, there was no reason why their affairs needed to become public knowledge. It was the most spectacular own goal. </p> <p><strong>Circulation fiddles</strong></p> <p>To supplement my meagre earnings as a 17-year-old trainee reporter, I used to deliver the paper to the newsagents each week. I could tell very precisely whether our sales were holding up because I counted the quires in and noted down the returns. Back at head office I could see that the figures were recorded meticulously, even when they were disappointing. I realised that it would be possible to fiddle them. Say we unloaded a bundle or two at a friend's garage on bad weeks? There would, of course, be a shortfall in sales revenue. That loss might be acceptable however because much more lucrative advertising revenue was tied to the level of circulation. </p> <p>I never got beyond daydreaming about such possibilities but others have shown fewer scruples by ramping up false sales. Remember the Birmingham papers a couple of years ago which were found to have exaggerated sales? Britain's industry appears relatively clean, though, compared with the United States where faking sales figures is assuming epidemic proportions. It was revealed last week that the Dallas Morning News has been found to have inflated its weekday circulation by 1.5% and its Sunday sale by 5%. Its owner, the Belo Corporation, said it would compensate advertisers who had overpaid, in addition to taking other measures. </p> <p>The embarrassing announcement comes after the recent discovery by two New York papers - Newsday and its Spanish-language stablemate, Hoy - that they had been guilty of overstating their sales figures. This followed last year's revelation that the Chicago Sun-Times, owned by Hollinger International, had fiddled its figures. So gross was the inflation that Hollinger - formerly chaired by Lord (Conrad) Black - said last week that the Sun-Times's latest circulation total is 23% lower than the previous return, amounting to a decrease of some 72,000 copies. </p> <p><strong>A brave goodbye to bulks</strong> </p> <p>The other great circulation statistics controversy is over the way in which papers and magazines add bulk sales to their \"headline\" totals. Multiple sales, as circulation managers prefer to call them, are regarded as sampling exercises and many papers, including this one, are regular users. But some companies, such as Trinity- Mirror, have all but dropped them. </p> <p>Now Emap has announced that it will strip out bulks from its consumer magazine returns, recording sales figures based only on their \"actively purchased\" sales. Emap's Carrie Barker contends that three leading celebrity titles together send out 159,000 bulks or free copies per week, while Harpers &amp; Queen, Tatler and Vanity Fair collectively send out 73,000 bulks or frees each month. Emap says its move will ensure that advertisers \"are given a more honest and transparent picture of an Emap magazine's health\". </p> <p>Well done, Emap! Let's hope it starts a trend.</p> <p><strong>An ill-Starred splash</strong></p> <p>The Daily Star did not so much jump the gun with its Big Brother scoop last week as compete in an entirely different race. Publishing with such certainty that a housemate had been evicted hours before the secret was revealed on TV, thus proving the paper utterly wrong, was unusually foolhardy. Not that the paper will suffer for the error. It has a zero credibility rating and its readers surely do not buy it for its high-minded mission to tell the truth.</p>",
  "<p>Amazon.co.uk has announced it will not distribute Craig Unger's bestseller House of Bush, House of Saud, published in the US by Scribner and in the United Kingdom by Gibson Square Books. </p> <p>So has Amazon broken rank with other booksellers and prised open the loophole in the law which all knew to be there? </p> <p>The company's statement reads: \"It is unfortunate that Amazon.co.uk is not able to carry the book House of Bush, House of Saud, on its website. However, UK libel law is prohibitively restrictive, and booksellers and retailers can be held responsible for libellous statements in books as if they had published the statement themselves. Amazon.co.uk is on notice that this book may contain defamatory content. Because it is impossible for us to defend or disprove claims of libel for the millions of titles we carry, we made the difficult decision to adhere to standard UK-industry practice and remove this book from our Amazon.co.uk catalogue.\" </p> <p>Every party involved in publishing a libel may potentially be held responsible for damages. That is taken to mean everyone in the chain, from the author, through the editor who makes the decision to publish, to the publisher who employs that editor, to the printer who prints the \"offending article\", to the wholesaler and to the bookshop or newsagent finally selling it to the public. And liability is \"joint and several\", making any link in the chain liable for the whole amount of the claim. </p> <p>There has long been a common law defence to an action for libel, known as \"innocent dissemination\". People contributing to the distribution chain but unaware of the libellous nature of the work would escape liability. At one end of the scale this could mean a postman delivering a sealed parcel containing a defamatory book, or a newspaper seller selling his newspapers without knowing they contained a libel. The history of this defence includes several cases involving WH Smith and dates back to the 19th century. </p> <p>The defence was given statutory form in, and has been largely replaced by, section 1 of the Defamation Act, 1996. The defence is not available to authors, editors or publishers (who are deemed incapable of innocence). It requires the person in the distribution chain to take \"reasonable care\" in relation to its publication, and requires also that the person does not know, and has no reason to believe, that what he does contributes to publication of a defamatory statement. </p> <p>What does \"taking reasonable care\" mean? When considering this, courts will have regard to the extent to which the person is responsible for the content or the decision to publish, and the nature and circum stances of publication. In the bookselling context this might mean that a bookseller taking five copies of a book which is in the bestseller lists could call on the defence. A retail multiple which orders several thousand copies, in advance of the print run, or a book club buying tens of thousands under its own imprint, knowing it to be controversial, and having read the proofs, may find it more difficult to use the defence. </p> <p>There have been two notable cases which addressed the new, statutory defence. In the internet defamation case Godfrey v Demon Internet Limited, his honour Judge Morland acknowledged that Demon (the internet service provider sued by Godfrey) was not the publisher of the libel, but found the statutory defence was not available once Godfrey had sent a fax alleging that the postings about him were defamatory. </p> <p>Then in 2002, Housmans, a small leftwing bookshop behind Kings Cross in London, was sued by a right-wing activist for selling copies of a pamphlet describing him as a \"homophobic plagiarist\". The bookshop's attempt to claim the defence under Section 1 of the Defamation Act 1996 failed, because it had received a letter before action. </p> <p>The problem with the legislation is that once a bookseller is notified that a person considers a book to be libellous, he must make his own decision, having no knowledge of the facts in question, as to whether a libel suit will succeed or not. The alternatives are to \"bet the store\" or withdraw the books from sale. It is not necessary to take out an injunction - mere notification is sufficient. </p> <p>It is one thing for a publisher, who has invested substantial sums in assessing and editing a book, and considered the legal risks involved, to stand firm. Publishers do not publish so many books that they cannot devote the appropriate resources to this task. And few publishers would withdraw a title on the basis of a threat of libel alone. </p> <p>Many books contain criticisms and allegations, which can range from mild to bitter. A bookseller cannot read all the books he has in stock. It would seem that all the criticised person will need to do is to write to the bookseller alleging libel. And if booksellers as a group decide that the easiest route is to avoid the risk and take the book off the shelves, who could blame them? </p> <p>Amazon's website in the United States (amazon.com) at the time of writing continues to sell the US edition to buyers in the UK, even though it contains material which the UK publisher decided to leave out. English defamation law says that publication occurs at the place where the words are read. So a US web retailer may be liable under English law for sending a libellous book to a UK resident. However, there is at least one US precedent where a New York court refused to enforce an English court judgment against a US defendant on the grounds that defamation law in England was unconscionable. </p> <p>There is also a public policy \"qualified privilege\" defence to libel, available where a party is under a legal, social or moral duty to communicate certain facts in the public interest. The defence will apply even if the facts stated are untrue, provided that the statement has been made in good faith and without any improper motive. However, and here English law differs from the law of the US, there is no general public interest defence in relation to allegations about public figures. Public interest alone is insufficient - there must be a duty incumbent on the publisher to disclose what may only amount to rumour. </p> <p>Whatever the thinking behind Amazon.co.uk's decision not to carry the book, few other booksellers have so far followed their lead. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Michael Evans is an intellectual property lawyer at Faegre Benson Hobson Audley LLP</p>",
  "<p>The sight of the Wolves manager Dave Jones falling over as he attempted to retrieve the ball in the closing minutes yesterday summed up his team's return to the Football League. </p> <p>The incident, which was captured by the TV cameras, will probably be replayed countless times during the season but, unlike several of his players, Jones was at least trying to inject some urgency into proceedings. </p> <p>\"Too many players did not do enough,\" Jones said later. \"There were too many off the pace and not making tackles. You've got to show desire and we did not show enough of it. We looked toothless and did not show commitment to go on and win the game. That's very unusual for us. </p> <p>\"Maybe it's the kick up the backside one or two of them needed. We're not in the Premiership any more. We're in the first division, which is very tough to get out of.\" </p> <p>The only fight and animation Wolves displayed, in fact, was of the counter-productive kind, when Kenny Miller and Shaun Newton accused each other of slack marking and had to be calmed down by the referee. \"The job is hard enough without fighting themselves,\" lamented Jones, who could at least take consolation from a fine debut from the Nigerian Seyi George Olofinjana. </p> <p>To dwell on the visitors' inadequacies, however, does not give Stoke credit for a display that justified the optimism built up in the closing weeks of last season. </p> <p>A thumping 4-1 win over the already promoted West Bromwich Albion in their penultimate game helped Stoke finish just seven points adrift of the play-offs. Had they taken their first-half chances yesterday, a similar margin of victory would not have flattered them. </p> <p>\"It was a good performance although we should have had the game won by half-time,\" said Tony Pulis, the City manager. \"But I'm not getting carried away. Walsall beat West Bromwich Albion on the opening day last season and look what happened to those two clubs.\" </p> <p>The gameplan employed by Pulis was simplicity itself: hit the ball past the Wolves defence for Ade Akinbiyi to chase. It was a tactic Wolves used after they paid \u00a33.2m for the striker five years ago when, as now, the pacy forward displayed erratic ball control, especially in front of goal. </p> <p>He missed at least three chances, although City's best early one fell to Darel Russell in the third minute, when he volleyed Lewis Neal's cross over the bar. </p> <p>Russell, however, was to make decisive amends but not before Ed de Goey foiled Wolves' most incisive move of the game: an exchange of passes between the Scottish internationals Colin Cameron and Miller that ended when the Stoke goalkeeper saved Cameron's shot. </p> <p>Within seconds Stoke took a lead they had long threatened and, for that matter, deserved. On 55 minutes Russell, who had delivered a succession of teasing crosses in the first half, was quick to react when Joachim Bjorklund miscued, and he hit it first time past Paul Jones and in via the inside of a post. </p> <p>Stoke's second goal was more contentious: Clive Clarke sliding home a 70th minute penalty after Wolves' defender Mark Clyde appeared to tug Akinbiyi's shirt. </p> <p>Any feelings of injustice Wolves harboured, however, must have been ended when Gifton Noel-Williams was harshly penalised for handball and Miller reduced the deficit to spark a frantic finale in which Olofinjana may well have equalised. </p> <p>Set up by Newton's square pass, the midfielder finally dipped to the mediocre levels of his new team-mates and scooped the ball high over the crossbar.</p>",
  "<p>It was appropriate that Preston, a proud founding member and inaugural winner of the league, should host one of the opening games of the Coca-Cola Championship - a rebranding intended to refresh the lower levels of the game. </p> <p>\"We are seeking to reclaim rather than dispense with our heritage,\" the Football League chairman Sir Brian Mawhinney said in the match programme. So what better place than Deepdale, with its Sir Tom Finney Stand and Bill Shankly Kop and the excellent and engrossing national museum to the game situated alongside? </p> <p>The so-called Real League is nowhere nearer being the Real Thing, though. Preston and Watford provided plenty of industry but little artistry. Mid-table mediocrity surely beckons for both, leaving the likes of Leicester, West Ham and Wolves battling to regain their place in the upper echelon of English football. </p> <p>That was where Preston once belonged, though that seems to have escaped their manager Craig Brown. \"Watford have got a pedigree that quite frankly we have not, but we hope to try and get it,\" he said. \"They might not be one of the more fashionable teams but at the end of last season they were good. </p> <p>\"The season before last they were in a Cup semi-final and five seasons ago they were in the Premiership. We're pleased to get the three points because many teams are going to find them hard to beat.\" </p> <p>Preston's hopes of a successful season may rest on a healthy diagnosis when their striker Ricardo Fuller visits a specialist in the US this week for a check on his persistent knee injury. The Jamaican international had a move to the Premiership wrecked last month when he failed a medical at Portsmouth, though Jim Smith was watching here and Manchester City and Blackburn are awaiting developments. </p> <p>\"Two different surgeons have said he might at some point need an operation but at the moment their advice is to continue to play,\" added Brown. \"If the surgeon feels there is no point at this time to operate then he will come back and play. </p> <p>\"I hope he will continue to be our player. Given he has not played since June 20 and has only done one week's full training, I thought he played very well.\" </p> <p>As for the match, well, unlike the drink after which the league is now named, all the fizz came at the end as Watford desperately sought an equaliser. They would have pilfered a point had the England Under-21 keeper Andy Lonergan not blocked Neil Cox's firmly-struck penalty just seven minutes from time. </p> <p>\"I think we should have had a point,\" said Watford's manager Ray Lewington. \"We let it go. We certainly had the chances and I felt on the balance of play we deserved something out of it.\" </p> <p>But Preston rightly claimed their first opening-game victory in four years largely thanks to their striker Richard Cresswell's effervescent display. It was his neat turn and instant shot from an acute angle, his first league goal in almost a year, which put his side ahead. </p> <p>Paul Devlin equalised early in the second half when he ghosted in at the far post, but David Healy's successful spot-kick and Lonergan's save shortly afterwards ensured victory.</p>",
  "<p>A billionaire had already committed his fortune to making Chelsea pre-eminent, but Jose Mourinho found a way of raising the stakes yet higher. When he could have wallowed in his eye-popping achievements with Porto, he put his reputation on the line not just by coming to England but by developing an addiction to risky, provocative decisions.</p> <p>He is a remarkable character and the annual rejuvenation of the Premiership has been achieved this summer by an upgrade in the quality of its foreign managers. Mourinho, typically, pointed to the paucity of trophies in the career of his predecessor Claudio Ranieri.</p> <p>At Liverpool, the departed G\u00cbrard Houllier suffers in the comparison with Rafael Ben\u00cbtez, who won LaLiga with Valencia in two of the past three seasons and found room in his schedule to collect the 2004 Uefa Cup. Just as creditably, he previously took Extremadura and Tenerife to promotion. Spurs, for their part, have Jacques Santini, who set up Lyon's present domination of the French scene.</p> <p>Of the trio, it is Mourinho who mesmerises. Whether they triumph or flounder, Chelsea have already ensured that they will be the story of the season. People are agog to see what happens when so much wealth is aligned with so bullheaded a coach. The size of the bills presented to Roman Abramovich has not varied, but everything else is transformed.</p> <p>Where Ranieri bought a few grandees of the European scene such as Hernan Crespo and Juan Sebastian Ver\u00cbn, none of the seven newcomers to Stamford Bridge this summer, who were mostly picked by Mourinho, is older than 26. All of them have something to prove, and not only because of their age. </p> <p>Ricardo Carvalho did not make the line-up for the opening match of Euro 2004, Paulo Ferreira was dropped after it and Tiago never got on to the field at all in the tournament. Who, a couple of months ago, would have valued that trio at a total of more than \u00a340m? Mourinho's disdain for the notion that Portuguese players might toil in the Premiership could not have been expressed with greater emphasis or expense.</p> <p>It is part of his temperament to egg himself on by striding into positions of potential vulnerability. There will be no comfort zone for his team either and he will not be inclined to lower expectations as Ranieri occasionally did. Someone commented that the self-revering Mourinho would be \"the most hated man in England\" by the autumn, but there is as good a chance that the country will see the potential fun and enjoy him as they once did Brian Clough.</p> <p>The Premiership is the better for the arrival of the Portuguese since the accent on continuity among the other obvious contenders for the title is not at all stirring. Having reclaimed the title without a single defeat, Arsenal deserve to be favourites, but most of their exertions go into the struggle to retain their squad rather than add to it.</p> <p>Although the club does an excellent job preserving its players in good physical condition, they may be hampered if individuals like Thierry Henry are as badly affected by the exertions at Euro 2004 as Sol Campbell. Ars\u00cbne Wenger at least knows his preferred line-up, but the development of a new Manchester United is still a work in progress.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson's decision to stock up on forwards, with Louis Saha and now Alan Smith both added in 2004, suggests a return to first principles at a gung-ho club. None the less, the all-round vigour will depend on how Rio Ferdinand performs once his eight-month suspension comes to an end in September.</p> <p>The leading three clubs will not, at any rate, expect to find interlopers in their midst. Having kept Steven Gerrard, Ben\u00cbtez might think of smashing the cartel and he has already shown at Valencia that he does not depend on a celebrity-strewn side. It is difficult, though, to envisage uprisings elsewhere in the Premiership.</p> <p>Most clubs lack the cash to cure all their problems. Even after the headline signings of Patrick Kluivert, Nicky Butt and others, for example, concerns linger about the Newcastle United defence, particularly if Jonathan Woodgate's fitness is once more erratic.</p> <p>Sir Bobby Robson's side seem to have improved, but may not be sure how much higher they can go in the table. Middlesbrough, now possessing the Premiership's moodiest striking partnership in Mark Viduka and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, start from a more modest position and have the greater scope for progress. Steve McClaren has means that other managers envy. Many clubs are paying belated attention to their accounts and funds have dried up to the extent that Butt's value has dropped by \u00a33m since Birmingham City failed to tempt him in January. Several boards, including Manchester City's, can barely contemplate transfer fees at all.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, those with even moderate resources ought to prosper to a disproportionate degree. Santini, who had spells, at different times, as technical director and coach at Lyon, should be able to settle into the structure at Spurs and direct a squad that has been more impressive than its results towards the top third of the table.</p> <p>The theory that a little investment can go a long way outside the Premiership's elite will also be tested at the Hawthorns. Relegated once, West Brom are trying to avoid the previous error and conduct themselves more like Birmingham this time. Jonathan Greening and the Denmark defender Martin Albrechtsen have both arrived, with Kanu's temperament also to be scrutinised in a workaday part of the football scene.</p> <p>It is tougher for Norwich City and Crystal Palace to get the right standard of recruit and the Premiership pecking order will not easily be disrupted by them.

  "<p>No matter what the TV companies, advertising copywriters and sportswear manufacturers may think, people do not go to football matches to be entertained. They go to rant, torment, sneer and experience child-like glee and black despair, but most of all they go because a football ground is the only place on the planet where a 40-year-old accountant with three children, a tracker mortgage, a Renault Megane on 0% finance and a rapidly expanding waistline can make obscene gestures at Robbie Savage without anyone thinking it in the least bit inappropriate.</p> <p><strong>Arriving at the ground</strong></p> <p> Two types of people go to football matches. The first group wear thick coats apparently made from old boiler lagging and arrive at least half an hour before kick-off. They then mill around aimlessly, glancing about the concourse in the hope of seeing the players' miraculously over-dressed wives and children arriving. The second group wear only the flimsiest shirt no matter what the weather and keep warm by a combination of beer and layers of aftershave. This group never gets to the ground until 30 seconds before kick-off. If you decide to join the latter body remember that in your rush to get to your seat you must shove, barge and stamp on everyone who has arrived sensibly early because they are the sort of middle-class tossers who are ruining football. </p> <p>When you get into the ground you will see lots of men and women in big, fat luminous coats that make their arms stick out from their sides like the wings of a wet cormorant. These people are the stewards. But don't let the word steward fool you. They are not here to provide any kind of service.</p> <p><strong>First half</strong></p> <p>Football fandom is a participatory sport, so get involved. Pick a player from your team and shower abuse on him at every opportunity regardless of how well or badly he's playing. Don't forget that everything that goes wrong is totally this man's fault. When the ball is booted 40 yards and runs out of play exclaim, \"Where's your bloody anticipation?\" Nothing should deter you. Just because the player you have chosen to target beats five opponents and finishes by blasting in a shot from 30 yards is no excuse to ease up. Simply wait until the celebrations have subsided and then grimly observe: \"The wages he's on he should be doing that every week.\" </p> <p>Always remember that the referee is devoutly biased against your team. Fate may be blind but refs are merely blinkered. It is essential to abandon any attempt at taking a balanced view of things. Fairness and perspective has no place in football. When abusing the match officials try to always include at least one reference to his or her rectum, for example \"Where's your yellow card, ref, up your arse?\" or \"Get your flag down from your backside lino and start signalling.\" The vast majority of people only go to football so they can get really really cross about something. Give them a helping hand by adopting an irritating habit. You might bring a klaxon, phone up your mates on a mobile every five minutes and hilariously pretend to be John Motson commentating on the match, or simply get up and go to the lavatory just when a corner is about to be taken. </p> <p>Or better still adopt a few key phrases and shout them randomly throughout the game. Try to make them technical sounding yet senseless: \"Our forwards just aren't working the big slots\", \"We need to get more conscious in the third phase\", \"We've gone baggy in the drop-off zone\" - that sort of thing.</p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong></p> <p>Bear in mind that at football matches you must do everything in advance to \"avoid the rush\" - even if it's just the rush of people doing things in advance. So if you plan to eat at half-time leave your seat at least 10 minutes before the whistle. You may miss goals and action, but you will get your offal, nose and throat in a bun quicker and force people in your row to stand up and let you through and that's what counts. </p> <p>Never offer any appreciation for the half-time entertainment. Whether it is a primary school penalty prize, a junior dance troupe from a local care home, or an internationally renowned opera singer simply stare at them with blank indifference and then as they leave the pitch remark in a loud voice, \"Well, what the hell was that in aid of?\" </p> <p>If you go to the lavatory always take a drink or some food in with you. Remember, as long as you've got one hand free you can still eat a hotdog or drink Bovril. And don't whatever you do wash your hands afterwards. You don't want people thinking you're some kind of hygiene-obsessed sicko.</p> <p><strong>Second half</strong></p> <p>For a little variety you might like to select a member of the opposition to subject to a series of ribald witticisms. Bald players or those who have just gone through a well-publicised marital break up are particularly amusing. Everyone appreciates the man who starts the \"Stand up if you've shagged his wife\" chant, especially when he's sitting in the family enclosure. </p> <p>The most important question you must address in the second half is when to leave. You have two choices: you can leave five minutes early to \"get away before the traffic\", or you can stay to the bitter end and then hang around the players' tunnel to make rude hand signals to the opposition's coach driver. Whichever choice you take you must stick to it no matter what is happening on the field. Only the most irresolute or feckless fans bases the decision on when to leave the ground on how the match is progressing. </p> <p>As the game goes on you may like to add to the mounting tension. Every time the opposition cross the halfway line say, \"This looks dangerous\" or \"They've got men over here.\" No matter what the score greet the final whistle by yelling: \"\u00a318 to watch that crap, I must be mental!\"</p> <p><strong>Leaving the ground</strong></p> <p>Whether you go early or stay to the end one or two important points of etiquette must be observed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Always bounce down the steps rapidly, as if you have just remembered you've have left the oven on. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> At some point remark loudly yet gnomically to a stranger next to you \"I'll not give him long after that result\" and then look away as if you weren't really talking to him at all. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Always step out on to busy roads without looking. You are part of a football crowd and traffic has to stop for you. It's the law.</p> <p><strong>Managerspeak: What you'll hear, and what it means</strong></p> <p>\"We're now looking to take this club to the next level\" <br>(\"If we get lucky we might sneak a Uefa Cup spot next season\")</p> <p>\"I'm very happy with the current squad\" <br>(\"The chairman refuses to allow me to spend \u00a36m on any more Eastern Europeans whose agents happen to be mates of mine\")</p> <p>\"I've told the lads just to go out there and enjoy the experience\"<br>(\"They'll get a right caning but I'm not going to admit that to Tony Gubba three hours before kick-off\")</p> <p>\"I saw a documentary last night about street kids in South America. It really put things in perspective\"<br>(\"We've just lost six on the trot, but that's no reason to sack me\")</p> <p>\"I treat the players as adults and I expect them to behave as adults\"<br>(\"I'm too busy getting pissed myself to keep an eye on this bunch of wasters\")</p> <p>\"The number of games at this time of the season is ludicrous. The FA has to look at the fixture list\"<br>(\"We just blew the Double by losing at home to Bolton\")</p> <p>\"I'm looking to add some experience to the squad\"<br>(\"An old drinking buddy of mine is available on a free\")</p> <p>\"We have to face up to the fact we don't have the resources of your Chelseas or your Man Uniteds\"<br>(\"Why don't the fans shut up moaning and enjoy 14th place?\")</p> <p>\"Decisions like the one the ref made today cost managers their jobs\"<br>(\"Our defeat has nothing to do with the fact I have spent \u00a330 million on ineffective strikers\")</p> <p>\"Sometimes you just have to hold your hands up and say on the day they were the better side\"<br>(\"The players are going to have to take the rap for this one\")</p> <p>\"I'm not going to stand here and make excuses\"<br>(\"I'm going to stand here and make excuses\")</p> <p><strong>Will we be relegated? Those telltale signs</strong></p> <p><strong>August</strong></p> <p>An opening day defeat to Champions League hopefuls Birmingham City does not dent your sense of optimism. </p> <p><strong>September</strong></p> <p>Only two points from six games but you remember it is a marathon not a sprint. The championship isn't decided in the autumn and neither is the drop. </p> <p><strong>October</strong></p> <p>Chants of \"You don't know what you're doing\" during a home defeat to West Brom. The manager assures everyone that he is \"working night and day to turn this situation around\". </p> <p><strong>November</strong></p> <p>A 0-0 draw at Anfield gives hope that you have \"turned the corner\", but then you lose to Spurs and Blackburn. The manager tells reporters that \"nobody is hurting more than me\". </p> <p><strong>December</strong></p> <p>Despite a run of four straight defeats the manager has noticed some \"promising signs\". He now just needs the backing of the chairman to bring in a centre-half and a goal-scoring midfielder during the transfer window. Oh, and a left-back who can actually tackle would not be a bad idea either. </p> <p><strong>January</strong></p> <p>The chairman announces that he and the manager have agreed that the club needs a \"fresh direction\" and the reserve-team coach will be taking charge until \"a suitable candidate of proven ability\" can be found. </p> <p><strong>February</strong></p> <p>Two wins in a row under the caretaker manager result in him being given the job on a permanent basis. Team promptly loses next five games. </p> <p><strong>March</strong></p> <p>You work out every possible permutation of results affecting the bottom six and figure that if you can just beat Arsenal away at the start of April everything will be all right. </p> <p><strong>April</strong></p> <p>After the 5-0 defeat at Highbury a senior player tells the press: \"It is time we the players took a good look at ourselves in the mirror.\" Two weeks later he puts in a transfer request saying he needs Premiership football next season. </p> <p><strong>May</strong></p> <p>At last the agony is over. With relegation a mathematical certainty you can get on with being good humoured in the face of adversity. Buy a t-shirt bearing the slogan \"Gillingham here we come\" and dress up as Rolf Harris for the last away game of the season.</p>",
  "<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, the Football Association needs more women. And not just so they don't have to share them in future. </p> <p>Over the past few weeks we have been entertainingly disabused of any suspicions that Soho Square is run as some kind of business-like body deputed to oversee English football. No. The FA's top brass resembles nothing so much as a stag weekend that has got ever so slightly out of control. </p> <p>In Mark Palios we have the likeable groom-to-be, who appears to have stumbled into an unfortunate liaison with someone best described as \"not his fianc\u00e9e\" on a wild weekend to Blackpool. Deeming the salvaging of his future happiness the priority, his mates decide the fire-storm waiting at home is best deflected by talking up the exploits of the most famously dissolute member of the party, namely Sven. The resultant blame-shifting caper would not have been out of place in a mid-90s Britflick, had the principals resembled Sean Pertwee rather than Syd Little. </p> <p>As the tale has progressed, male commentator after male commentator has elbowed his way into a TV studio to talk about root-and-branch reform of the management structure, a revolution-not-evolution approach, an end to underhand dealings. </p> <p>Gentlemen, you have been endearingly earnest. But the solution is simple: hire some more ladies. It's a central London office, not the Jedi Knights. When I called Soho Square to say I was writing a column about the FA and women, the very nice press officer obliged with a weary snigger. </p> <p>Assuring him I genuinely didn't mean it the way it sounded, I asked who the most senior women at the organisation were and was greeted with an apologetic rundown which included the women's team manager, someone responsible for marketing the women's game and someone who works in Trevor Brooking's department. </p> <p>\"No,\" it was conceded, \"we don't have any management team members who are women. But about 30% of our office staff are women.\" Two-to-one being something of an unfortunate ratio in the circumstances, we'll move on. </p> <p>In this day and age, high-profile organisations who steadfastly resist the rise of female personnel and retain their status as boys' clubs almost invariably run into trouble. I have no wish to drag the Catholic church into things but there are times over the last few weeks that the FA's dealings have put one in mind of the core values of the Renaissance papacy. You suspect that if a nine-year-old could be made head of communications in order to keep the stipend in the family, he would be. Instead, they appointed Colin Gibson, which judging by the News of the World telephone transcripts appeared to be the next most competent thing. </p> <p>Enough has been written about Gibson's blokey willingness to sacrifice a PA clearly deemed expendable in order to protect his mate. But coupled with some parts of the organisation's clear attempts to rid themselves of Sven over a sex scandal because they're too wet and unnecessarily financially compromised to sack him over what they deem his football failings - well, it is the kind of thing you expect from a bunch of Rover-driving Rotarians. </p> <p>Yet unfairly the most vitriol will probably be reserved for Faria Alam who, considering the upset of exposure, actually took a bewilderingly long time to respond to Max Clifford's tireless attempts to reel her in. Only after two weeks of his appearing on TV daily saying she had been treated appallingly and could make a million (although he wasn't advising her) did she finally get in touch. I have no doubt Clifford would concede that by the normal yardsticks applied to those in the eye of a tabloid storm she was more than backward in coming forward. He announced her resignation with the brilliantly understated explanation that she didn't really relish the thought of turning up to work as normal, all things considered. </p> <p>It is optimistic to hope this saga will see the FA boys' club disbanded overnight. But instead of expending their energies trying to keep names out of things, the FA could do with drawing the widest selection of them possible on to their wish list of those to replace Palios. Karren Brady, anyone?</p>",
  "<p>Southampton's chairman Rupert Lowe became the standard bearer for the professional game yesterday when he called for wholesale reform of the Football Association. </p> <p>There is an appetite among the clubs to take advantage of the FA's latest setback and expand their influence on the game, even though there appears little connection between the Faria Alam scandal and the organisational structure of the game's governing body. </p> <p>\"The FA has made a lot of progress with the financing of Wembley but it has not been a good time lately for the FA,\" said Lowe yesterday. \"I think it's now an opportunity to look at the structure of the FA and put in place a sustainable structure and then find the right people to carry out the requirements. We need to get the FA into a shape that everyone can be proud of.\" </p> <p>The board meeting convened last Thursday was ostensibly to formulate the FA's next move after the resignation of the chief executive Mark Palios last Sunday. However, initial discussions were held to consider the division of the two principal concerns of the game's governance: regulation and commercial activity. </p> <p>It is felt that any such separation would allow greater opportunity for representatives of the professional game to dictate the areas of commercial exploitation open to the FA or even to bring all such activities in-house. </p> <p>\"The key issue here is to get the structure of the FA right,\" said Lowe. \"The FA really is the game's governing body and that's what it should be, in charge of rules and regulations and the grassroots, and if at all possible it should avoid getting too involved in too many other areas.\" </p> <p>Lowe has been a strong proponent in the movement for greater control over the FA's commercial remit since he joined the main board in 2003. The Premier League's record of winning lucrative broadcasting contracts and redistributing funds throughout the football pyramid would lend weight to Lowe's argument, which would also present cost-saving opportunities. </p> <p>However, Lowe fails to detail his lobby's blueprint for the England team, whose ability to generate funds is crucial to the success of the \u00a3757m Wembley project. </p> <p>Disturbingly for opponents of the move, there is a feeling that there will be increased political muscle for such reform after the appointment of the chairman of the national game board Roger Burden and the Premier League chairman Dave Richards to assist the FA chairman Geoff Thompson.</p>",
  "<p>The future of Manchester United could be decided later this week as American sports businessman Malcolm Glazer holds talks to try to buy out John Magnier and JP McManus, fellow shareholders in the premiership club. </p> <p>The two Irish entrepreneurs, who together hold 28.9% of Manchester United, are understood to be interested only in selling their entire stake rather than merely reducing their hold on the football club. </p> <p>Mr Glazer, the billionaire owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football club, already holds 19.2% of the company, meaning that if the Irish duo sell out he will be forced to make an all-out bid. Representatives of Mr Glazer will meet the Irish pair on Tuesday, according to reports over the weekend. </p> <p>The removal of John Magnier and JP McManus from the United shareholder base would come as something of a relief to Sir Alex Ferguson. The two businessmen had a public spat with the club's manager over the ownership of stud fees for retired racehorse Rock Of Gibraltar. </p> <p>The two sides settled out of court earlier this year but the Irish investors raised embarrassing questions about how the club conducts business. </p> <p>Many in the City believed Mr Glazer was waiting for the two sides to sort out their differences before mounting an offer. </p> <p>The stake in Manchester United owned by the Irish pair is held by Cubic Expression, their British Virgin Islands-registered investment vehicle. Last night a spokesman for the company said: \"Cubic Expression does not comment on rumours or speculation.\" Mr Glazer was unavailable for comment. </p> <p>A deal between the two sides is by no means a certainty. The activities of the American businessman have created intense speculation since he appeared on the scene last autumn. But so far it has proved to be all smoke and no fire. </p> <p>At the end of March the watchmaker turned fish oil seller was forced to admit that he had \"no current intention\" of making a bid for the business despite having hired German investment bank Commerzbank to come up with funding for an offer. </p> <p>Normally such phraseology would preclude a company from bidding for six months but Mr Glazer managed to secure a special deal with the Takeover Panel - which monitors City bid action to ensure fair play - exempting him from that convention. </p> <p>Having secured his right to buy and sell shares in the company he has returned to the market twice to increase the size of his stake. But concerns over his ability to raise the cash for an all-out offer persist. The club's shares have almost doubled in value over the past year and stood at 254.5p on Friday, valuing the company at \u00a3667m. Traders think Mr Glazer would have to offer about \u00a3800m to take control. </p> <p>Although he is a wealthy man he is not believed to have the personal financial firepower to make an all-out bid at these sorts of levels. In March it was the job of Commerzbank's head of investment banking in London, Mehmet Dalman, to try to put the cash together. Mr Dalman, a keen United fan, emerged as a player in the saga after he helped put together a \u00a330m share trade which brought Mr Glazer 11.8m shares. </p> <p>News of a possible change of ownership should go some way to compensating for the club's embarrassing defeat yesterday at the hands of arch rivals Arsenal in the Community Shield.</p>",
  "<p>Maheta Molango was a full 19 seconds into his Brighton career when he celebrated his first goal for the club; the 2004-5 season dragged on for another minute before Reading levelled the scoreline. Well, there's no point hanging about, is there? </p> <p>This was surely one of the most dramatic starts to a league campaign. Bums were barely reacquainted with seats when Glen Little's botched clearance found its way to Molango on the left-hand side of the six-yard box. The former Atl\u00e9tico Madrid striker lifted the ball past Marcus Hahnemann from a tight angle; it seemed to take another 19 seconds before anyone registered what had happened. </p> <p>The stunned silence was eventually broken by the Albion end, not that they were noisy for long. Hahnemann's next act was to welt a route-one clearance into the visitors' box; the ball was headed sideways by Steve Sidwell for the unmarked Dave Kitson to side-foot into the roof of the net. From the worst possible start to their season, Reading were en route to an opening-day victory. </p> <p>\"It was lucky we equalised quickly,\" said the Royals manager Steve Coppell. \"If they had dwelt on their lead, with their extra man in midfield it would have been difficult for us.\" </p> <p>Instead it was Brighton who struggled. Little shrugged off his early mistake to become the first half's most effective player. Teaming up with Graeme Murty down the right, he made Dan Harding's life hell, consistently passing round the full back then pumping deep, dangerous crosses into the penalty area. </p> <p>One such move led to Reading's second goal. A dummy run from Murty confused Harding to such an extent that he resembled a puppy scampering off for a stick its master had yet to throw; Little was left with space to curl a pinpoint cross which Nicky Forster deliciously laid off for James Harper to flick home from the edge of the area. </p> <p>For Harding the worst was yet to come. After 14 minutes of the second half he half-stood on the ball while alone in the centre circle; Forster powered in to take control, race away and belabour a shot past Michel Kuipers. The goal was reward for Forster's intelligent running, which suggested a promising partnership with Kitson could be developed. \"The great thing with Fozzie is his unpredictability,\" said Coppell. \"It makes him different.\" </p> <p>With the midfielder Bobby Convey, an \u00a3800,000 capture from DC United, unused on the bench, Coppell has strength in depth; Reading will aim for the play-offs at least. Brighton have more modest ambitions - survival will do - and can take heart from a battling display. They made a scrap of this game by pulling a goal back on 63 minutes, Adam Hinshelwood sliding a pass which allowed Jake Robinson to turn on the penalty spot and scoop home. It wasn't enough, but it did suggest Albion's residency of the Championship need not be for one season only. </p> <p>\"Reading were better than us, but not by a lot,\" argued Brighton's manager Mark McGhee. \"We're staying optimistic. I've got a young squad and am excited about that. This group can do better than they did today.\" They'll never have a better start, though.</p>",
  "<p>S\u00e9bastien Loeb, despite being caught flat-footed and finishing a subdued fourth in the Rally Finland, managed to extend his world championship lead to 22 points. The Frenchman had no need to chance his arm once Petter Solberg crashed, and he is now more than two wins clear. </p> <p>Loeb has won four times in nine rallies this season but found his Citro\u00ebn ill-suited to the jumps and awkward tightening corners of one of the quickest rallies on the calendar, in which average speeds can exceed 80mph. </p> <p>\"I am not really happy, because [at] the beginning of the rally we were not fast enough,\" Loeb said after finishing behind his team-mate Carlos Sainz. \"We need to adapt the car and I need more experience in these conditions.\" </p> <p>The local hero and double world champion Marcus Gronholm ended a 15-month drought to take the first victory for Peugeot's troublesome 307 after both his team-mates crashed and he lost top gear, forcing the team to refit the original gearbox, which had been replaced when it became noisy. </p> <p>\"I think Marcus still has some chance of being world champion - we just have to win the next eight rallies,\" Gronholm's team director Corrado Provera said. </p> <p>Last year's victor Markko Martin was cheered on by 10,000 fellow Estonians, but was no threat this time in his Ford. Second place was nevertheless an exceptional result, since he still has cloudy vision in his left eye as a result of an 110mph accident in Argentina three weeks ago. </p> <p>\"Mentally, I could have gone a lot faster but if you can't see, it's stupid to take big risks,\" Martin said. \"I decided to go as quickly as I felt comfortable.\" </p> <p>Though his vision may well improve in the next few weeks, there is a possibility that the damage is permanent.</p>",
  "<p>On a day when the Super League was reshuffled like a pack of cards, Warrington missed a glorious chance to take control of a play-off spot and it was instead a rejuvenated Bradford who jumped two places into third. </p> <p>The Wolves drew level just before half-time, but a second-half hat-trick from Leslie Vainikolo turned that 16-16 scoreline into a convincing victory and justified the feeling that they are hitting form at the right time. </p> <p>The Bulls, who had lost two of their last three, climb over St Helens and Friday night's visitors Wigan, and though their coach Brian Noble would not talk about the \"twists and turns\" of league positions afterwards, with six weeks to the finals even he reckoned: \"We're getting there.\" </p> <p>Vainikolo struck twice in the first 15 minutes of the second half and Bradford soaked up Warrington's second wind before he charged over for his third 10 minutes from time. Just one second-half try was not much reward for Warrington's first-half efforts, but their coach Paul Cullen said a lopsided penalty count was the cause, and squarely blamed his players, not the referee Ashley Klein, for it. Cullen said his side would continue to \"fight and push\" for the top six, but this was a crucial chance gone. </p> <p>One of Bradford's big positives as the season climaxes is Iestyn Harris, who looks increasingly comfortable as he enters his second month back in rugby league. \"He's going great: he's learning what life is like at the top level of Super League,\" Noble reflected. </p> <p>And Harris posed most of the early threat to Warrington, although barring an early Paul Deacon penalty it was 19 minutes before that told. A long, floated pass finally allowed Shontayne Hape a nonchalant stroll, and then a darting Harris run from a scrum set up Stuart Reardon to make it 16-6 and the Bulls might have taken control. </p> <p>But two interceptions brought Warrington level seconds before half-time. The first rather dented the Harris hype as Nat Wood, who had earlier scored the first visiting try, seized on another long pass from the stand-off and sprinted 95 metres; the second was even more dramatic, Brent Grose timing his leap to snatch Deacon's pass on halfway and storm over as the Bulls pressed forward dangerously. </p> <p>Warrington's hopes of getting out of the bottom half of the table began to diminish soon after the restart, after the least impressive of the afternoon's tries. Logan Swann's kick dribbled through the Wolves defence and allowed Vainikolo to pounce. </p> <p>Swann had a hand in the New Zealand winger's second five minutes later, with a sidestepping run before Lee Radford's overhead pass had the defence trailing. Warrington battled back upfield and the substitute Martin Gleeson nipped over from short range, but the game had gone and instead a 45-metre effort from Chris Bridge presaged Vainikolo's final eruption, as he steamed over after a neat one-two with Jamie Peacock. </p> <p> <strong> Bradford Bulls: </strong> Reardon; Pratt, Pryce, Hape, Vainikolo; Harris, Deacon; Anderson, Paul, Fielden, Swann, Peacock, Langley. <strong> Subs:</strong> Bridge, Radford, Moore, Parker. </p> <p><strong> Warrington Wolves:</strong> Appo; Fa'afili, Grose, Burns, Gaskell; Briers, N Wood; Hilton, Clarke, Leikvoll, Wainwright, P Wood, Forshaw. <strong> Subs: </strong> Gleeson, Guisset, Lima, Sibbit.</p>",
  "France's former rugby captain was under arrest for murder yesterday after allegedly shooting his wife dead at a party on Saturday night. <p>About 60 fellow guests, who had gathered in Bourgoin-Jallieu, near Lyon, central France, to celebrate the end of the rugby season, were reported to have witnessed Marc C\u00e9cillon pull out a handgun and shoot his wife Chantal three or four times, just before midnight. She was hit in the head and throat. </p> <p>The shots were said to have caused panic among the guests. The former rugby captain apparently received a blow to the head in the confusion and was himself hospitalised before being taken into police custody. </p> <p>Police said that he had been under the influence of alcohol and had not sobered up until yesterday morning. </p> <p>One guest at the open-air gathering told Reuters that he had been aware of a row taking place, and half an hour later saw a man come in with a pistol and begin to shoot. </p> <p>Friends said yesterday that the couple, who had two daughters, had been on bad terms for several years. A police officer confirmed they had had a \"difficult marital history\". </p> <p>However, Pierre Martinet, president of the local rugby club, Bourgoin-Jallieu (CSBJ), where Mr C\u00e9cillon had spent most of his career, told the French media that Chantal, a medical secretary, had been very proud of her husband, and that the couple had not been experiencing real problems. </p> <p>People who knew the former captain said yesterday that he had struggled to adjust to life after his retirement as a national sporting figure. </p> <p>They suggested that this had occasionally caused him to take to drink. </p> <p>His arrest will highlight once more the difficulties some players face in working out how to fill their time once they leave the world of professional sport. </p> <p>Mr C\u00e9cillon, 45, is regarded as one of the best French players of his generation. He retired in 1999 after playing for France 46 times, and captaining his country on numerous occasions. </p> <p>The town of Bougoin-Jallieu was in shock yesterday, as news spread of the incident. Mr C\u00e9cillon is a local hero, not only for his national success, but for his record with the local club, CSBJ, for which he played for almost 25 years. </p> <p>Mr C\u00e9cillon's career began when he trained as pastry chef under a man who was also the head of the local rugby club. </p> <p>His large build attracted much attention at the start of his career. </p> <p>Since retiring, he has worked as coach for his former club and has operated as a rugby ambassador. </p> <p>Of his 46 international matches, the French team won 31, drew one, and lost 14, with Mr C\u00e9cillon racking up nine tries for a total of 38 points.</p>",
  "<b> Daily Express</b> <br> Editorial, August 7 <p>\"News that Scotland Yard believes it has seized two of the most dangerous terrorists in the world is a great boost ... Their capture is a significant step forward in the war against the men who wish to destroy the western way of life. But it is a battle, rather than the war itself, which has been won. Police now believe that five al-Qaida militants escaped during the raids. Al-Qaida continues to recruit, in this country as well as the Middle East ... In recent weeks the war against terror has been overshadowed by doubts that it was being used for electioneering purposes, both here and in the United States. That must not be allowed to happen. The west is under a greater threat than at any time since the end of the cold war. It is essential that our leaders rise to the challenge.\" </p> <p><b> Sun </b><br> Editorial, August 7 </p> <p>\"The home secretary speaks wise words over the al-Qaida terror threat to us all. David Blunkett sensibly urges us to keep a sense of balance, and not to indulge in unnecessary alarm. And he rightly dismisses the idea that our anti-terror laws are directed solely at Muslims. We are all aware that the real danger of a terrorist attack is going to remain for many years. But our security forces are tackling those who hate our way of life with every means at their disposal. And if there are five Pakistani terrorists on the run in Britain then no one should give them cover.\" </p> <p><b> Observer</b><br> Editorial, August 8 </p> <p>\"In the UK no details have been released of those arrested last week, leading to fevered speculation over their identity and the threat they may or may not have posed. This is counterproductive - the irrational flourishes and Islamophobia gains ground ...</p> <p>\"So far we have merely paid lip service to the idea of tackling the roots of terror. We must face up to difficult issues - Israel-Palestine, our dependence on oil, Saudi Arabia's continuing subsidy of the most conservative strands of Islam in existence, the failure of moderate Islamic leaders to counter the appeal of the radicals, the siege mentality that is becoming so prevalent on both sides - and act ... The bulk of the work will, of course, have to be done by those most affected by militancy: the world's 1.3 billion Muslims. But act we must or be left the threats, assessments and the confusion of the unknown for decades to come.\" </p> <p><b> Financial Times</b><br> Editorial, August 7 </p> <p>\"The trust that the general public appears to put in the Blair government's counter-terrorist strategy does not extend to the Muslim community. The latter complains that successive police dragnets produce very few convictions but succeed in tarnishing its image. The police say this low conviction rate is due to the difficulties of using intelligence material in UK courts and to delays in getting evidence from abroad. But it is also hard to resist the conclusion that wide police sweeps are being used as a blunt instrument to disrupt al-Qaida networks. This could be counterproductive. If British Muslims feel alienated, they will stop supporting the fight against terrorism with their eyes and ears, just as Americans may if they become inured to excessive terror alerts.\" </p> <p><b> Michael Portillo</b><br> Sunday Times, August 8 </p> <p> \"The British public has become ... cynical. That is deeply unfortunate, as the threat from terror is real. It is the fashion of our times not to take anything at face value, but Mr Blunkett and the police have provided good grounds for public scepticism. Their clumsiness damages community relations, too ... An administration that locks up foreigners without charge but also enshrines the wishy-washy banalities of a human rights protocol into our laws cannot be pigeonholed as either hard or soft on civil liberties ... While all that can be portrayed as sophisticated political positioning, a simpler explanation is that the government is philosophically incoherent.\" </p> <p><b> William Hague</b><br> News of the World, August 8 </p> <p>\"The war on terror, you might believe, is being messed up or is a bit of a joke. [But] there is a major, well-funded, highly organised and cleverly led network of terrorist organisations grouped around al-Qaida ... [and] their objective is to kill on a huge scale ... Fighting this threat is not easy and presents difficult choices ...</p> <p>\"I would prefer hand-wringing by critics of tough action to an inquiry into how terrorists got through yet again. A lot of people are going to die unless we support the police, intelligence services and soldiers who are trying to prevent it.\" </p> <p><b> Phillip Knightley</b><br> Independent on Sunday, August 8 </p> <p>\"Road accidents are the nation's biggest killer. Smoking kills more people than terrorists ... So why does our government do its best to keep us worried about terrorism? ... Governments, although they will not admit it, believe that a bit of fear in the community makes for a country that is easier to control, easier to govern ... Perhaps one answer to striking the right balance between being wary and alert and being fearful all the time would be better intelligence about the terrorist threat. This will not be easy ... Let's get on with enjoying our lives and leave it to the terrorist doom-mongers to wallow in their own fear.\"</p>",
  "John Prescott is the best deputy leader Labour has ever had. That is a big claim. Putting aside Clement Attlee, whose place in party history is in all ways unique, the list of incumbents includes politicians of unusual distinction. But Healey, Jenkins, Brown, Bevan and Morrison were all handicapped by a liability that Prescott has avoided. They really wanted to be leader. <p>Brown and Morrison attempted the leap from number two to number one and never recovered from their rejection. Jenkins might well have succeeded where they failed had he not put his European principles above party loyalty when he was the obvious heir apparent. For Bevan and Healey the deputy leadership was not so much an honour as a consolation prize. Prescott values the job in its own right. </p> <p>Prescott's belief that he would be crucial to the success of the government has been vindicated far more often than the newspaper stories about reconciling Blair and Brown suggest. His 10 years in the job have been characterised by the unremitting determination both to protect his leader, as a good deputy should, and at the same time to edge party policy away from the more reckless extremes that his leader has favoured. On all the essential social democratic issues - education, health, housing - Prescott has been on the progressive side of the argument. </p> <p>Very often he has managed to do no more than deflect policy a couple of degrees to the left. And it would be easy to complain that he should have done more. But had he thumped the table every time the cabinet met - losing the consensus, if not the argument, to the sycophantic majority - his credibility and behind-the-scenes influence would have been destroyed. And the threat to resign - like all ultimate deterrents - is a weapon that can be used only once, and is then likely to devastate both sides of the battle line. He was right to keep plugging away in private while displaying conspicuous loyalty to the man with whom he so often disagrees. </p> <p>It is at least possible that, without Prescott's support, Tony Blair would not have survived as prime minister. There will be many party members who believe the devotion to be misplaced. But they are also the men and women who stay in the party, at least in part, because people such as John Prescott retain some connection with real Labour. The self-proclaimed praetorian guard - Byers, Milburn and Mandelson - justified Blair's policy excesses to party members from whom he needed no protection. Prescott - by emphasising (and sometimes inventing) what he called proof of the prime minister's belief in basic Labour principles - has defended him against the natural enemies who now make up a majority of party members. Only last week I was told: \"Blair can't be so bad. John gets on with him.\" </p> <p>But John has a problem. Before he became deputy prime minister he was elected deputy leader of the Labour party, and he knows that he owes a debt of loyalty to the political coalition - unions, constituencies and the ragbag of special interest groups - that made him. He knows, too, that the coalition is near to collapse. Party membership is in steep decline and party morale has sunk even lower. The trade unionists who talk about creating a new party are sensible men with serious determination. The prime minister clearly welcomes the death of the party with ideological opinions and democratic influence over policy, and hopes for its resurrection as a once-in-four-years phenomenon that comes together to help win elections. Prescott has more sense of Labour history. </p> <p>He also has more respect for the party that - because of his birth and background - he realises is essential to the progress of social democracy in this country. He now must think of himself as the man, perhaps the only man, who can stand in the way of its continual degradation. I hope he realises that the party in the country sees him as Labour's saviour. Most members want a new leader, and a majority of them hope that it will be Gordon Brown. But they expect Prescott to make sure that, when the change comes about, there is still a party for Gordon Brown to lead. </p> <p>It will not be an easy task to perform. If tomorrow John Prescott announces that Tony Blair must go, Labour would have a leadership election in the autumn. But that scenario is as impossible as it is undesirable. Somehow - perhaps employing a subtlety that his critics do not believe him to possess - Prescott has to persuade the prime minister that the future of the Labour party is just as important as the greater glory of the leader who cuckoos in its nest. Threats may have to take the place of persuasion. But saving the party is John Prescott's obligation. It will also confirm his place in history as the best deputy leader Labour has ever had. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>"
