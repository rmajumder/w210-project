  "<p>Retail billionaire Philip Green yesterday banked another \u00a340m as he announced record profits at the Bhs chain.</p> <p>The retail group, which he bought for just \u00a3200m four years ago, published results for the year to the end of March showing record underlying profits of \u00a3112m, up 6%.</p> <p>That increase was achieved despite flat sales. Mr Green said the boost was instead due to \"better stock control, less markdown, less terminal stock, quicker speed to market - just being more efficient\".</p> <p>He also paid tribute to \"the continued loyalty, commitment and passion shown by our 14,000 people\".</p> <p>Bhs is paying out \u00a342.75m as a final dividend, of which Mr Green - who owns 94% of the business - will get the lion's share. The final dividend comes on top of \u00a3157m paid at the halfway stage.</p> <p>In a move that will increase the pressure on his former friend Stuart Rose at Marks &amp; Spencer, Mr Green, whose \u00a39bn bid proposal for M&amp;S was spurned by its board in the summer, revealed that recent comparative sales at the chain had climbed 1.3%.</p> <p>On Tuesday M&amp;S announced a 7.7% drop in its underlying sales of clothing and homewares.</p> <p>The billionaire's summer battle to win control of M&amp;S was his second tilt at what was once the UK's leading retailer.</p> <p>Under Takeover Panel rules he is free to make another bid in January. Mr Green has also been suggested as a possible buyer for the ailing Sainsbury's supermarket chain - he made an approach a year ago but was rebuffed - but yesterday he said: \"I'm resting. I'm not looking at anything at this moment, I'm just trading the businesses.\"</p> <p>He said Bhs had the potential to deliver much more. The chain generated sales of only \u00a3200 a square foot, while Next achieved \u00a3600. \"If we did an extra \u00a350, then \u00a3111m in profit would become \u00a3200m.\"</p> <p>The entrepreneur also owns the Arcadia group of fashion brands, which includes Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Top Shop and Burton. It is due to produce its financial results next Thursday.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the retail sector, Peacocks and Burberry - which operate at opposite ends of the high street spending spectrum, announced strong sales figures.</p> <p>Peacocks - which recently acquired the Fragrance Shop chain - said strong sales had offset problems at its downmarket bonmarch\u00e9 chain.</p> <p>Bonmarch\u00e9 sales, on a same-store basis, dropped 7.2%, but Peacocks and the Fragrance Shop recorded increases of 9% and 9.5% respectively.</p> <p>At Burberry, underlying first-half sales were ahead 14%, powered by retail expansion and the new Burberry Brit men's perfume. Chief financial officer Stacey Cartwright said Chinese shoppers were \"literally queueing outside the door\" of the Hong Kong store.</p>",
  "<p>Icelandic companies were the focus of City takeover speculation yesterday after stock broker Numis admitted it had turned away a takeover approach, seemingly from an Icelandic bank, while Big Food Group said talks with its Icelandic suitor were continuing. </p> <p>The emergence of the interest of Icelandic bank Landsbanki in Numis follows months of speculation that another City firm, Singer &amp; Freidlander, will receive a takeover bid from Iceland's biggest bank Kaupthing. </p> <p>It has also turned the spotlight on the ambitions of Iceland's major companies and their inter-relationships. </p> <p>Kaupthing is the main banker to Baugur, the retail company that is considering a takeover bid for the troubled Big Food Group, the UK concern that owns the Iceland frozen food chain and the Booker cash and carry business. While Baugur has already made its mark in Britain, taking over toy shop Hamley's, clothing companies Oasis and Karen Millen, and Goldsmiths the jewellers, Iceland's banks are still fighting to win complete control of a British financial company. </p> <p>Analysts in Iceland believe the City should not be surprised by the UK ambitions of Icelandic companies, particularly banks despite the relative size of the Icelandic and British economies. </p> <p>\"The banking sector has grown rapidly here. The local market is very small, with only 300,000 people and with only so many businesses. The three main banks [Kaupthing, Islandsbanki and Landsbanki] have grown very fast. The capital structure is strong. The way to grow is to look outside of Iceland,\" said Atli B Gudmundsson, analyst at Islandsbanki. </p> <p>Until yesterday, the City had been most aware of the ambitions of Kaupthing which has amassed a 20% stake in Singer &amp; Freidlander and which this week announced plans for a rights issue which could be used to fund a takeover bid. </p> <p>But another Icelandic financial firm, Burdaras, has also built a stake in Singer &amp; Freidlander, of nearly 10%. And Burdaras is in turn linked to the bank rumoured to have approached Numis, Landsbanki, which owns a major stake in Burdaras. </p> <p>Numis, of which Icap chairman Michael Spencer owns nearly 10%, would not reveal the identity of its spurned bidder. Its shares rose 55p to 610p yesterday. </p> <p>It was reported, however, that the approach was from the once state owned Landsbanki. The bank is now stock market listed but largely controlled by three wealthy individuals - Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson, his father Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson and their business partner Magnus Thorsteinsson. </p> <p>Until Iceland started privatising its banks in the late 1990s, the Icelandic stock market had been dominated by the fish industry. However, the banking sector now dominates the market along with one pharmaceutical company, Actavis, which is also linked to the three individuals who run Landsbanki. </p> <p>But it was Baugur, which is considering using its 22% stake in Big Food Group as a platform for a full takeover bid, which first helped make the City aware of Icelandic companies' ambitions. Baugur made its first foray into the City with an ill-fated takeover attempt of Arcadia, the Top Shop and Dorothy Perkins. </p> <p>Baugur's boss Jon Johannesson already had the franchise for Top Shop in Iceland and wanted control of the whole firm which is now owned by entrepreneur Philip Green. </p> <p>Mr Johannesson has tentatively offered 110p for Big Food Group. But Big Food Group's shares were down 1p at 91.75p yesterday amid concern that Baugur might try to lower the price after Big Food's second quarter trading statement showed the fall in sales was accelerating. </p> <p> <strong>Cold facts</strong></p> <p><strong>Population:</strong><br> <strong>Britain</strong> 59.6m <br> <strong>Iceland</strong> 290,570 <br></p> <p><strong> GDP:</strong> <br> <strong>Britain </strong>\u00a31,099bn<br> <strong>Iceland </strong>\u00a36.4bn <br></p> <p><strong> Five largest firms by market cap: </strong> <br> <strong>Britain</strong><br> BP \u00a3120bn <br> HSBC \u00a3100bn <br> Vodafone \u00a390bn <br> GKS \u00a368bn <br> RBS \u00a352bn <br> </p> <p> <strong>Iceland</strong><br> Kaupthing \u00a32.2bn <br> Actavis \u00a31.2bn <br> Islandbanki \u00a30.9bn <br> Landsbanki \u00a30.9bn <br> Burdaras \u00a30.5bn <br> </p> <p> Sources: Statistic Iceland; ONS, Icelandic Stock Exchange; Reuters</p>",
  "The former French prime minister Alain Jupp\u00e9, who is fighting a corruption conviction that may end his political career, admitted yesterday that he had committed \"errors, even faults\", but insisted that he had never intended to break the law. <p>Mr Jupp\u00e9, President Jacques Chirac's most loyal lieutenant and for long his chosen successor, was given an 18-month suspended sentence earlier this year and barred from elected office for 10 years for a political financing scandal involving a fake jobs scam at Paris town hall.</p> <p>On the first day of his appeal hearing, Mr Jupp\u00e9, who has resigned as an MP and head of Mr Chirac's centre-right party UMP to fight his case, said he did not claim to be above reproach.</p> <p>\"I have doubtless committed errors, even faults through negligence,\" he told the appeal court in Versailles. \"But in all conscience, I never had any intention of breaking the laws of the republic.\"</p> <p>He said he had been \"profoundly shocked\" by the verdict, and \"refused to believe\" its most severe finding, that he had \"betrayed the trust of the French people\".</p> <p>Prime minister from 1995 to 1997, Mr Jupp\u00e9 was accompanied yesterday by a new lawyer, Jean-Ren\u00e9 Farthouat, who succeeded last year in saving a former foreign minister from prison in a huge Elf corruption case.</p> <p>At his trial in January Mr Jupp\u00e9 angered the judges by insisting, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary and confessions, that he had not been aware of the scam in which Paris town hall and private companies paid the salaries of up to 175 activists from the RPR party, the predecessor of the UMP.</p> <p>Mr Jupp\u00e9, who ran the town hall finances for most of the 18 years from 1977 to 1995 when Mr Chirac was mayor of Paris, and was also general secretary of the RPR between 1988 and 1993 when the scam was at its height, was suspected of overseeing the entire scheme.</p> <p>But he was charged only in connection with the hiring of seven full-time RPR staff who were paid by Paris taxpayers between 1990 and 1995.</p> <p>A member of his legal team said: \"At the original trial the position was pretty much, 'Move along now, there's nothing to get worked up about.' This time we will try and give explanations to the court and stress that this is not a question of morality but of the law.\"</p> <p>Mr Jupp\u00e9 continued to insist yesterday that the seven fake jobs for which he was charged were genuine town hall posts.</p> <p>\"I had no part in these people's recruitment,\" he told the court. \"As far as I was concerned, they were doing an effective job for Paris.\"</p> <p>But none of the seven involved actually had an office at the town hall, and one of them, Farida Cherkaoui, who was in charge of Mr Chirac's trips and visits, has told the police that she worked for the RPR.</p> <p>Mr Jupp\u00e9, who is appealing with five of the 21 other people convicted in January, apparently hopes that the court will either overturn his conviction, or at least reduce the length of time he is barred from elected office.</p> <p>Asked by the presiding judge whether he thought he should be acquitted, he replied: \"I hope to convince the court.\"</p> <p>His conviction was a serious blow to Mr Chirac, upsetting carefully laid plans for his succession.</p> <p>Some commentators now argue that even if he is acquitted, he has been so weakened that he can no longer be seen as a credible candidate, certainly not against the right's new hope, the ambitious and popular finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>",
  "In the open fields around Caserta, north of Naples, large herds of buffalo graze on lush grass, and tobacco plants tower along the roadsides. On the face of it these fertile, sun-baked Italian plains look like ideal farmland, but the soil here hides a poisonous secret. <p>Every week, in this centre of the buffalo mozzarella industry, heaps of old tyres, asbestos, battery acid and chemical sludge are dumped by the lorryload in ditches, under bridges and in holes dug for the purpose. </p> <p>\"A third of Italy's waste is disposed of illegally, and Campania is where much of it ends up,\" says Donato Ceglie, the Caserta prosecutor investigating the \"ecomafia\" responsible for the dumping. </p> <p>Paolo Russo, a Neapolitan senator in Forza Italia, the prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's party, who heads a parliamentary commission on waste trafficking, says: \"The waste arrives by road every day. It doesn't fall out of the sky. But it seems we need a military operation to stop it.\" </p> <p>In the \"triangle of fire\" between the towns of Qualiano, Giugliano and Villaricca on the lower slopes of Vesuvius, the sky is lit most nights by the bundles of old clothes soaked in toxic liquid being burned by the Camorra mafia, sending columns of foul smelling smoke into the sky. </p> <p>There is growing evidence that waste disposal is now what keeps many mafia clans in business. As one pentito (mafia informer) proudly told his police interrogators: \"Me, I turn rubbish into gold.\" </p> <p>The leading Italian environmental campaign group Legambiente estimates that in the past 10 years the ecomafia has made \u20ac132bn, about 13% of the estimated \u20ac100bn annual turnover of the four leading mafia groups, which in turn amounts to about 10% of the Italian GDP. </p> <p>Toxic waste dumping and illegal construction are second only to drug and arms trafficking in profitability, investigators say, and infinitely less risky. </p> <p>The authorities are still looking for an estimated 13.1m tonnes of toxic waste which \"disappeared\" last year. </p> <p>The dumping is by no means confined to Caserta. In several parts of the country farmers have been tricked into spreading tonnes of sludge on their land thinking it was a free trial of fertiliser. Others have unwittingly laid asbestos on tracks after being told it was gravel. </p> <p>Around Caserta the authorities have counted 152 contaminated \"lakes\" which appeared in the 1990s when the mafia helped itself to tonnes of sand for illegal construction and dumped chemical waste in the pits left behind. </p> <p>Mr Ceglie's investigations have so far identified 1,200 illegal dumping sites in Campania and about 5,000 throughout Italy. He estimates that farmland, woods and urban wasteland adding up to an area almost the size of Wales has been contaminated and should not be farmed or accessible to the public. </p> <p><b> Off limits</b><br> </p> <p> Farmers in Caserta fear that sooner or later toxins will destroy their livelihoods. </p> <p>\"One more landfill around here and the toxin levels in the buffalo milk will go over the safety limit,\" says Ettore Corvino of the Caserta region Coldiretti Farmers Association, staring at a stinking municipal tip, now closed, near Caserta. </p> <p>They have already come alarmingly close. Between May 2002 and December 2003 the local authorities declared 18 districts off limits for grazing after dangerous levels of toxins were recorded in the milk of cattle and sheep. More than 10,000 animals were slaughtered and 9,000 tonnes of contaminated milk destroyed, Legambiente says. </p> <p>Scientists have warned for years that the soil and the water in the area are contaminated but official studies and figures have yet to confirm it. </p> <p>Michele Bonomo, head of Legambiente's Campagnia regional office, says: \"Toxins have already been found in milk and in some maize that is fed to animals.\" </p> <p>The health of local people is seriously at risk, he adds, but there is no evidence yet that people eating the region's products are likely to suffer health problems. </p> <p>\"Toxins are slow to show themselves in people. Many farmers have been [affected] but they are not keen to report it. It's a problem we won't identify in the local population for another 10 years. </p> <p>\"But if we do not change direction and regain control of the land in this region we will face something similar to your mad cow disease.\" </p> <p>Alfredo Mazza, a scientist at the National Research Council, who was born locally, believes that toxic-waste dumping is linked to a cluster of cancer deaths in the region. He began collecting cancer data after he noticed an alarming number of death notices in his home town, Nola, north-east of Naples. </p> <p>Comparing local government cancer records in Campania with those elsewhere in Italy, he found that men living in the area between the towns Acerra, Nola and Marigliana were more than twice as likely as the average Italian to get liver cancer, and women more than three times as likely. He says that about 250,000 people in the region have been exposed to toxic pollutants. </p> <p>Mr Mazza, who recently published his findings in the Lancet, says: \"The land has been so badly damaged by illegal waste dumping it is already practically unusable. Local people have not realised they are being poisoned. And the authorities have not wanted them to know.\" </p> <p>Legambiente, which has been tracking the illegal dumping for the past 10 years, estimates that the number of mafia clans involved in toxic waste disposal, illegal construction and trafficking rare birds has risen from 19 to 64. </p> <p>Through apparently legitimate front companies, the Camorra undercuts competitors by up to 90% to snatch toxic waste disposal contracts from factories seeking to reduce their costs. </p> <p>Its activities have prevented the local authorities in Campania disposing of the densely populated region's waste, leading to violent protests. There is tension in the area around Acerra, north of Naples, where a huge domestic waste incinerator is planned. </p> <p>Pierluigi Vigna, head of the National Mafia Commission, says: \"It is much harder for us to stop this new kind of organised crime. It's easy to track down a murderer with blood on his hands. But an illegal bank transfer, done in a split second, can take six months to trace.\" </p> <p>So far 130 waste traffickers have been arrested and 147 companies are being investigated in 16 Italian regions. But in most cases lack of evidence against individuals and companies makes it difficult to bring charges. </p> <p>Once toxic waste has passed into mafia hands, its toxicity label is removed and those who see it being dumped are intimidated into silence. </p> <p>\"People have the impression that organised crime is being stamped out,\" he says. \"But the mafia is alive and well. It has become more discrete, more intelligent and richer than before.\"</p>",
  "<p>Being able to dictate letters down the phone is the feature of Pannone &amp; Partners' new telephone system that Carol Jackson, head of personal injury at the Manchester-based law firm, likes best. </p> <p>The company has replaced its conventional telephone arrangements with a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) system - which converts ordinary voice calls into packets of data that can be sent over the net - from Canadian company Mitel. This has provided increased flexibility for the firm's 74 partners and 495 employees. </p> <p>Now it is quick and easy for people to move their extension number to a new desk or take calls that come into the office when they are at home. And one bonus is that it is easy to dictate letters and other legal instructions over the phone and have them arrive on the right person's desktop PC. </p> <p>\"From the car after a meeting works for me,\" says Jackson. \"It's easier than sitting in front of my secretary while she waits for me to gather my thoughts. The dictation appears on her PC, or can be routed to another secretary.\" </p> <p>Jackson adds: \"I use the [VoIP] system not just in the office but at home over broadband, too. It means that if I've been to a meeting in Leeds, I don't have to go back to the office in Manchester just to send an urgent fax. Then when I log on from home, I can check what my secretary's typed up and can, if I need to, fax off a few documents.\" </p> <p>Some of these features are achieved by using Citrix software to connect the law firm's home-based users to the company's case system, but there is no doubt that VoIP makes the system more versatile. </p> <p>Pannone &amp; Partners first considered integrating VoIP with its IT system when its contract for the Centrex switching service expired early this year. It negotiated a one-month rolling contract while it looked for an alternative. </p> <p>At that time, the firm had to pay every time a lawyer changed desks and needed the telephone extension moved. It also took 10 days for the company they were using to make changes to the pick-up groups, which enable any lawyer in a department to answer the phone for another. </p> <p>Today, all the company's VoIP handsets plug into its data network, and a separate telephone network is not needed. To move a handset, all the user has to do is plug it into an Ethernet socket at their new desk, plug their PC into the handset, and change some parameters in the VoIP software. New pick-up groups can also be set up using the software. </p> <p>Chris Styles, the technical systems manager, says: \"The new system is more adaptable, costs less to maintain and integrates better with IT systems such as Microsoft Exchange (email) and Outlook (contacts).\" </p> <p>When a phone call is received in the office, the recipient can see the phone number/person calling on their PC screen. They can transfer the call to a colleague either before they've answered it, or afterwards. </p> <p>To ensure the client gets a quick response, they can also see, from a small icon on the screen, whether the lawyer they intend to transfer the call to is already on the phone. </p> <p>These features - as well as confer ence calling and being able to see if a colleague is away from their desk - will be available to most of the firm's lawyers from home this month. Styles says the VoIP system also records the length of calls for onward billing. </p> <p>The Mitel system cost \u00a3250,000 and was installed over a weekend. The external phone lines were simply connected to the firm's data network rather than to its old telephone network. For resilience, the 180 incoming lines are now connected to three linked switches, so if one goes down, the others can take over. </p> <p>Styles says: \"I did not find VoIP difficult to get my head around as I come from a data background, but I do advise any company thinking of putting in a system to get a thorough assessment of their local area network, to make sure it can cope with extra voice traffic. </p> <p>\"We got 360 Solutions [communications consultants] to do an assessment for us, and though we did not need to spend extra on expanding network capacity, we did have to prioritise voice traffic on the network, so there would not be a delay of even a second while people were speaking.\" </p> <p>The system could also help some of the firm's employees who are parents to balance work and family commitments by being able to work from home when they need to. Of its staff, 74% are female, and its managing partner, Joy Kingsley, has two young children. </p> <p>The old Centrex phone system isn't missed. Styles says: \"All it provided really was a handset on a desk - costing us money in maintenance, and in moves and changes.\"</p>",
  "An 18-month-old girl was shot and wounded and a four-year-old boy narrowly escaped injury when the car they were in was raked with gunfire in Hackney, east London. <p>The child was hit in the leg but was not badly hurt. However, her father and another man, aged 30 and 35 respectively, were in a serious but stable condition in hospital after their vehicle came under attack on Monday evening. </p> <p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said a man armed with a handgun fired 10 to 15 shots into the Citroen Picasso, parked in Blurton Road. </p> <p>\"The gunman is believed to have been with two other men at the time,\" the spokesman said. \"They appeared on foot from the direction of Chatsworth Road and disappeared back in the same direction after the shooting. </p> <p>\"The child suffered a minor gunshot wound to the leg. Her condition is described as stable. A second child, a four-year-old boy, was in the car, but fortunately was not injured.\" </p> <p>The area where the shooting took place is a busy thoroughfare, full of cafes, shops and fast-food outlets. Gokhan Alp, 23, who runs a furniture store nearby, said he heard a noise like firecrackers and saw people gathering round screaming. </p> <p>\"A woman was very distressed,\" he said. \"She was crying, yelling, shouting 'baby' and rolling around on the floor. At first, I thought she had been shot but I think it was anguish because she got up and walked away.\" </p> <p>After the shooting, the victims picked up the girl's mother, who was not in the car at the time, and drove to an east London hospital. The two men have since been transferred to another hospital. </p> <p>Detectives from the Met's Operation Trident, which investigates gun crime in the black community, are keeping an open mind as to the motive. </p> <p>Hackney residents say there is widespread gun and drug crime in the area and the lack of CCTV cameras makes it easier for criminals. </p> <p>A mother-of-two, close to tears as she visited the scene, said: \"It is so shocking because a baby is involved. There have been about six shootings here in the last five years. It is appalling. It was only a matter of time before a child was caught in crossfire.\"</p>",
  "The family of a man shot dead by police who mistakenly believed he was carrying a firearm will go to court today in an attempt to identify those responsible. <p>Relatives of Derek Bennett, a black man shot in Brixton, south London, three years ago, will ask the court of appeal to overturn an order promising two police officers anonymity when they give evidence at the inquest next month. </p> <p>Mr Bennett died after officers were called to an estate by reports of a man carrying a gun, found to be a gun-shaped cigarette lighter. Mr Bennett, 29, a psychiatric patient, was hit with four shots. </p> <p>Last year, after an investigation by Northumbria police, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. </p> <p>One of the two firearms officers involved, known as Sergeant A, said he fired six shots because he feared for his own life and that of his colleague. Sergeant B did not fire. They have fought to remain anonymous on the grounds that their safety may be threatened if their names are made public. </p> <p>In June at the high court, Mr Justice Mitting quashed the decision of the inner south London coroner, Selena Lynch, to refuse the men anonymity. The officers are likely to give evidence by videolink. </p> <p>The shooting of Mr Bennett caused great community tension. The two officers have returned to duty but have not carried firearms.</p>",
  "<p>We are transfixed by proposals floated by Gay Huey Evans, the director of markets at the Financial Services Authority, to the effect that listed companies should be obliged to make immediate public results statements as soon as board directors sign off a company's figures. </p> <p>The fear, apparently, is that insider dealers will somehow get at the information and make illegal gains from their early knowledge. </p> <p>For the record, most board meetings convened to consider year-end or interim figures tend to be held in the afternoon, after which draft financial statements are given a once-over before being sent - after the markets have closed and on an embargoed basis - to the official news distribution outlets, including the London Stock Exchange's regulatory news service. </p> <p>These results statements are then sent out to all media organisations first thing in the morning, before stock market dealings begin, so the market as a whole has a chance to digest the contents. </p> <p>Ms Huey Evans and her colleagues seem to be prescribing a system whereby analysts' meetings, media briefings and all the other paraphernalia which accompanies the release of corporate information, are arranged on the hoof, at any time of the day or night - and all in the misguided belief that this will somehow put the investors on a level footing. </p> <p>What this proposal betrays is a shocking lack of understanding on the part of London's financial regulator about exactly how and when information is abused in any financial market. By the time the full board of any listed company considers a set of annual or interim figures, those numbers have already been crawled over by the accounts department, the firm's broader management, its financial advisers and its auditors. </p> <p>If the information is going to leak, it will have leaked already - and the insiders will have their bets in place before the board even sits down. </p> <p>Abolishing the current overnight system of information distribution simply adds a new and painfully thick layer of cost for publicly quoted companies. </p> <p>More important, removing the opportunity for market participants to consider news outside regular market opening times creates additional volatility in share prices as investors and market makers react, in knee-jerk style, to breaking news. </p> <p>It promises to turn ordinary news into a potentially extraordinary revelation at any time of the day or night. </p> <p>The resultant volatility in individual stocks will draw increased interest from hedge funds, which happen to exist largely outside the control of the FSA. </p> <p>In turn, this will contribute to the increasingly widespread process whereby hedge funds clip the investment returns of ordinary members of the public, whose cash is sitting in investment vehicles such as pension and long-term savings funds. </p> <p>Oh, and those crooks genuinely dealing in advance, on the inside, will see their own returns amplified as the market as a whole scrambles to price in corporate news that will inevitably break in disorderly fashion. </p> <p>Somebody needs to blow a loud whistle here. </p> <p>Time and again, London's regulatory authorities betray a casual ambiguity regarding the fact that their determined march towards some sort of academic model of market transparency amounts to a tax on the innocent, while simply encouraging those who want to find ways to abuse the system. </p> <p><strong> Digital count </strong><br> </p> <p> Cocojambo may sound like the latest addition to London zoo's collection of primates, but it is in fact an even rarer beast than a mountain gorilla. It's a sign of a pick-up in the world of new media advertising. </p> <p>Cocojambo, actually a two-year-old branded entertainment agency, yesterday launched an eponymously titled quarterly guide intended to help prospective advertisers link up with computer game developers. </p> <p>The idea of placing advertising in computer games has been around since the heady days of the dotcom boom. </p> <p>The most obvious examples of this trend are to be found in racing games, where the hoardings on the side of digitised racetracks are actually sponsored by particular companies. </p> <p>But until now, getting an advertisement on a game has been a rather haphazard affair. </p> <p>The Cocojambo guide - the first edition is due out at the end of the year - will provide advertising agencies and their clients with a list of forthcoming titles so they can shoehorn their brands into the living rooms and bedrooms of players the world over. It will even include games designed to be played on mobile phones. </p> <p>Crucially the guide, which will be distributed free to advertisers, is being backed by the developers and publishers of these games, rather than just being the brainchild of an advertising executive. As such, it marks an important coming of age for the new media world and a sign that perhaps digital advertising is more than just monkey business.</p>",
  "<p>The European commission will take Germany to court today for refusing to scrap a 1960 law protecting Volkswagen from a hostile takeover by in effect giving the state control of Europe's biggest car maker. </p> <p>The commission will brush aside opposition from at least one of the two German commissioners, Michaele Schreyer, who oversees the European Union budget, and send its case that Germany is infringing treaty rules on the free movement of capital to the European court of justice. </p> <p>Its decision to raise the stakes in a long-standing battle with Berlin comes as VW, which is losing market share in Europe, faces stiff union opposition to its plans for a two-year pay freeze in a drive to cut labour costs by 30%. </p> <p>It coincides with plans by General Motors Europe, expected to be announced tomorrow, to cut up to 12,000 jobs from its 62,000-strong workforce, with many of these falling on two German plants - R\u00fcsselsheim, near Frankfurt, and Bochum, in the Ruhr. </p> <p>The 1960 \"VW Law\" privatising the company gave the federal government and the car maker's home state of Lower Saxony a blocking 20% vote on the board and a stake now worth 18.5%. A majority of more than 80% is required for important board decisions. </p> <p>Brussels, which first accused Berlin of infringing the treaty in March 2003, argues that investors in other EU countries are hindered from buying shares in VW \"with a view to participating effectively in management decisions or controlling it\". </p> <p>Its case draws heavily on a court ruling in May 2003 that the British government's golden share in the airports operator BAA, which limited voting rights of a shareholder to 15%, breached treaty rules. </p> <p>The legal action, expected to last up to two years, is certain to provoke hostile criticism from the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who sat on the VW supervisory board as Lower Saxony's prime minister, and who has chosen Peter Hartz, VW personnel chief, as architect of his labour reforms. </p> <p>Talks have resumed in Hanover over VW's cost-cutting plans, which could see 30,000 jobs go from the 103,000-strong workforce if unions reject a pay freeze. Negotiators for IG Metall, the German engineering union demanding a 4% pay rise, suggested a wages deal could be struck as long as the car maker offered job guarantees.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Ramco Energy</strong> surrendered early gains to finish unchanged yesterday as market professionals latched on to rumours that the main lender to the troubled gas producer - which operates in the Celtic Sea off Cork - is poised to call in a \u00a357m project loan. </p> <p>Having hit 35p, Ramco shares fell back to finish at 30.5p as rumours circulated that the Bank of Scotland had run out of patience after studying the technical review of the Seven Heads gasfield, 35 miles off the Irish coast. </p> <p>At the time of last month's interim figures Ramco claimed the review had identified a number of ways to improve production, which was supposed to supply 10% of Ireland's gas needs but started producing water earlier this year. </p> <p>A spokesman for Ramco refused to comment on yesterday's speculation but said as far as the company was concerned discussions with its lenders continued. </p> <p>At the half-year, Ramco's debts stood at \u00a368.6m, of which \u00a356.6m was secured against the Seven Heads field. </p> <p>If the Bank of Scotland does call in the loan and Ramco cannot pay then the bank will take control of the Seven Heads field. That will leave Ramco with a small oil service business, which City traders reckon is worth about 3p a share. </p> <p>In the wider market, leading shares closed lower as investors suddenly started to worry about the impact of the rising oil price on economic growth. With US crude futures touching a record high, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> came to rest 35.7 points lower at 4,649.8 with gas-guzzling <strong>British Airways</strong>, off 5p at 199.75p, among the biggest fallers. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the <strong>FTSE 250</strong> index shed 69.3 points to 6,302.7 as the housebuilding sector came under pressure after <strong>George Wimpey</strong>, 10.75p cheaper at 377.25, warned that customers were taking longer to decide whether to buy a house and were increasingly demanding incentives to sign on the dotted line. </p> <p>Meanwhile the <strong>FTSE Small Cap</strong> index eased 12.9 points to 2,593. In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year gilt closed at 101.980, yielding 4.746%. </p> <p>Back among the blue chips, there was no respite for <strong>J Sainsbury</strong> as its shares fell a further 4.75p to 245.5p - their lowest level since July 2003. Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, caused yesterday's damage by cutting its target price to 200p. </p> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> fell 12p to 560p as investors banked profits. However, market professionals noted that Merrill Lynch had increased its earnings forecasts for 2005 and 2006 by 4.7% and 8.4% respectively and set a 665p target price ahead of the company's upcoming investor day. </p> <p>Lower down the market, takeover speculation was again swirling round merchant bank <strong>Singer &amp; Friedlander</strong>. Its shares climbed 10.75p to 307.25p - the best performer in the FTSE 250 - after the company's biggest shareholder, Iceland's Kaupthing Bank, announced plans to raise \u20ac460m-570m (\u00a3317m-\u00a3393m) via a rights issue. </p> <p>Kaupthing, which has built a 20% holding in S&amp;F, said the proceeds of the fundraising would be \"used to provide additional free capital with which to finance possible acquisitions that strengthen its investment banking and asset management operations in Scandinavia and the UK\". </p> <p>Much like Ramco, <strong>Big Food Group</strong> surrendered early gains to close just 0.5p higher at 93p amid fears that today's second-quarter trading update could disappoint and prompt bidder Baugur to lower its proposed takeover offer of 110p a share. </p> <p>In the small cap world, computer games developer <strong>Eidos</strong> improved a penny to 91p after Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein analyst Andrew Lee called on the shareholders to put pressure on the company to accept a bid, even if it is made at yesterday's closing price. </p> <p>Mr Lee is concerned that Eidos, which admitted to takeover talks at the start of August, may be seeking too high a price for the business and fears shareholders may lose out as a result. He points out that Eidos is a small company with virtually no \"must-have\" titles. </p> <p>Elsewhere, in the games sector, Aim-listed minnow <strong>Warthog</strong> jumped 20% to 0.54p after Gizmondo Europe revealed it had acquired an 8.6% stake in the company. Gizmondo Europe is a subsidiary of US company Tiger Telematics, which claims to have de veloped the world's most sophisticated gaming device. Warthog games will be available on the device. </p> <p>On a different tack, <strong>Minorplanet Systems</strong>, the vehicle-tracking specialist which halved on Monday after warning of increased full-year losses, regained its poise. After hitting 3.25p early in the session, its shares rallied to close unchanged at 4.75p after Investec Securities, the com pany's joint broker, said it was now vulnerable to a bid. </p> <p>Building materials group <strong>Cape</strong> improved 0.5p to 127.5p amid talk of a bid approach of 160p a share, while jitters ahead of tomorrow's full-year results saw alternative telecoms company <strong>Fibernet</strong> marked 6.5p lower at 92.5p. </p> <p>Is there something going on at <strong> Redrow</strong>? That was the question traders were asking themselves yesterday after the Flintshire-based housebuilder put in a strong performance. </p> <p>While the rest of the sector was down in the doldrums after the gloomy trading update from George Wimpey, Redrow closed 3p higher at 358p. City traders said rumours of a board meeting and talk of a nil-premium merger had supported the Redrow price. </p> <p>Analysts reckoned there could be something to the speculation. Redrow is one of a number of housebuilders that have a market capitalisation of around \u00a3500m and is in danger of being left behind by the industry's big three - <strong> Persimmon</strong>, down 12p to 636p, <strong> Taylor Woodrow</strong>, off 8.75p at 252.25p, and Wimpey. </p> <p>A deal with a rival such as <strong> Westbury</strong>, 11.25p cheaper at 386.75p, or <strong> Bovis Homes</strong>, 15p weaker at 519p, would be one way of bulking up and generating some useful cost-savings, especially if the industry is headed for tough times.</p>",

I'm excited that's what I am, getting away from these yoke-em choke-em times. </p> <p>I'll leave the airport with red eyes, squits in my pants, irritable, we will have arrived. Now then, do we go left, do we go right? I shall write punctum (a word I like the sound of, but don't know how to use).

  "The Fathers 4 Justice lobby has both Saint Bob and Batman on its side in its arguments against the government's green paper on child contact. Last night's Channel 4 programme, Geldof on Fathers, reiterated the view that mothers have everything their way when families part, and that the only fair way forward is to insist that children are split 50/50 between warring parents whether they like it or not. <p>The stunts pulled by Fathers 4 Justice have already been sufficiently persuasive for feminists Jenni Murray and Maureen Freely to publicly dub them the new suffragettes. In one sense perhaps they have a point. Suffragettes didn't just campaign for the vote. Their stunts and slogans changed the words and images with which women were able to imagine their lives. As men demonstrate for the right to be fathers, perhaps they will change the way in which men think about themselves. </p> <p>But that is as far as the comparison goes. Women were fighting for a change in the law that would give them an equal right to vote. Men already have an equal right in law, \"to have responsibility for, and a meaningful relationship with, their children, so long as it is safe\". The suffragettes were fighting for all women. Fathers 4 Justice is fighting for fewer than 2% of separated fathers - for that is the number who, having been granted a contact order by the courts, have then been forced to return to court because their ex-partners have frustrated that order. The number of contact orders refused is 0.8% of applications. </p> <p>So far the government has resisted demands by the representatives of this 2% either to grant parents equal residence rights or to increase penalties available for women who obstruct contact. It has done so in the face of an increasingly distorted picture of the facts. Many newspapers have suggested that equal residence rights are common in other countries. In fact, there is no country that automatically grants equal residence rights to parents, because to do so would breach children's rights and it is their welfare that should be paramount. </p> <p>Another common misconception is that 40% of fathers lose contact with their children because, according to a front-page story in the Sunday Telegraph in April, \"mothers admit to 'thwarting contact' between children and their fathers\". Surveys find that the reasons for breakdown are varied but there is no suggestion that mothers obstruct contact in many cases. </p> <p>Research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) into contact arrangements found that the overwhelming majority of resident and non-resident parents were happy with the status quo. Those parents with the highest level of contact were most satisfied with arrangements - discontent rose as the level of contact declined. When asked what would most improve things, the ONS study found that it wasn't so often the fathers who said they wanted to see more of their children - twice as many parents with residence (mostly mothers) wanted that contact to increase. Indeed, this was the single most important improvement they suggested. </p> <p>It appears that, while a small number of fathers are being shut out of their children's lives, many more are not taking up the opportunities offered to become more involved. This finding ties in with a battery of smaller-scale qualitative research showing that, while it is true that women are overwhelmingly in the driving seat over parenting, they are usually driving towards greater paternal involvement. Indeed, it is often the mothers' willingness to keep steering, often against the odds, that keeps relationships between father and children intact. </p> <p>This mother provides anecdotal, but fairly typical, evidence of what is often involved: \"One summer he brought them home [from holiday] four days early. I was working. I just had to find childcare. That's when I realised I couldn't rely on him, so I had to come to terms with it. I organised my own back-up system. For a while it was hell and misery but I always thought it was terribly important for them to see their father, and things have got a lot better now.\" </p> <p>What will most help those fathers who are unfairly cut off from their children is not so much a change in the law as a change in the culture. Research from the Cava centre in Leeds shows that, when relationships break down, for most people the overwhelming desire is to \"do the right thing\" for the children. For a small minority \"the right thing\" is keeping Dad away from his kids. Some women remain to be convinced that fathers do have a valuable role - before the relationship breaks down. </p> <p>In a survey of \"high fliers\" by Maloney Search, over 80% of mothers said they would be happy to ask for an hour off to deal with a family crisis. Only 14% of fathers would. Over the last 20 years, fathers' involvement with young children has increased substantially, but analysis of Time Use Surveys, by Irene Bruegel of South Bank University, shows that much of that extra time happens in the company of their partners. Fathers spend little time alone with their children. </p> <p>Charlie Lewis of Lancaster University interviewed a group of ex-cohabitees about the reasons for the split. Four out of 10 of the women said it was because their partner was \"immature\". Imagine one of these lone mothers, struggling with the care of difficult children (and children caught up in contact disputes are often upset and difficult). Will she look up at the TV, see a bloke in tights being picked off a roof by a policeman, and think: \"That is the role model I want for my son\"? Images are powerful, but we cannot always be sure which way they will be read. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:a.phillips@gold.ac.uk\">a.phillips@gold.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "Ukip's warring factions have agreed to take a vow of silence on the question of who heads the party, after a long and at times heated summit in Brussels. <p>The party's MEPs, including Robert Kilroy-Silk, met with the party leader, Roger Knapman, for an afternoon-long meeting at which \"strong views were expressed\".</p> <p>The row - which threatens to implode the fledgling party - came after Mr Kilroy-Silk, MEP for the East Midlands, made plain at the weekend that the current party leader should stand aside for him.</p> <p>In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph the former daytime TV star and ex-Labour MP stated his ambition to run the anti-EU party, despite Mr Knapman having two years left to run of his four-year mandate.</p> <p>Today's meeting of the party's 11 sitting MEPs was supposed to settle the issue. But instead Ukip's chief whip in the European parliament, Jeffrey Titford, issued a short statement saying merely that the discussion would continue - behind closed doors.</p> <p>He said: \"Senior members of the party had a long and amicable discussion in which, on both sides, strong views were expressed.</p> <p>\"All those involved were, however, concerned that although there were legitimate differences on the direction that the party should take, nothing should be done to damage its long-term prospects.</p> <p>\"It was therefore decided that the discussions would continue in order to arrive at a position that would be in the long-term interests of the party.\" </p> <p>Although Mr Kilroy-Silk is credited with immeasurably raising the profile of the party, and being at least partially responsible for their unexpected 12 seats in the European parliament in June, his undisguised ambition has angered some in the party.</p> <p>One Ukip MEP, Ashley Mote, has since been suspended pending investigations into housing benefit fraud.</p> <p>\"He's like a little boy who didn't get what he wanted for Christmas,\" said one highly placed member of the party, of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He was offered deputy leader, or leader of the MEPs in Brussels - but those weren't good enough. He demanded the leadership and complete control of the manifesto.\"</p> <p>Mr Kilroy-Silk's debut speech at a Ukip conference, in Bristol earlier this month, led directly to the party's major donor, Yorkshire millionaire Paul Sykes, pulling the plug on his sponsorship of the party and reverting to the Tories. </p> <p>Mr Kilroy-Silk had urged Ukip to stand candidates against even anti-EU Tory MPs, with a vow to \"kill\" the Conservative party, rather than give it the \"kiss of life\".</p>",
  "Welcome to the Backbencher, Guardian Unlimited's weekly insider's guide to Westminster. <p>In this week's Backbencher: Saatchi seeks satisfaction, the Tories play God, and what Tony Blair can learn from David Beckham</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS WEEK IN POLITICS</p> <p>The Backbencher asked Guardian Unlimited's news and politics editor, Tom Happold, for his take on the renewed parliamentary interest in Iraq.</p> <p>\"It's a sign of Tony Blair's renewed confidence that he was so aggressive in rebutting Michael Howard's demand for an apology at prime minister's questions today. </p> <p>\"The Tory leader wanted him to say sorry for exaggerating intelligence evidence on Iraq's alleged arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. The prime minister refused, accusing him of undermining Britain's troops in the Gulf in the process.</p> <p>\"'It would be more helpful if you would back our troops out in Iraq, rather than doing what you are doing now,' he said. 'I wish you would stop playing politics with this issue, which is precisely what you are doing, and remember that you and your party supported the war for precisely the same reasons that we do.'</p> <p>\"Pinpointing the Tories' weaknesses -and then hammering away at them - is one of Mr Blair's greatest talents. He knows that Mr Howard is stuck with an Iraq policy inherited from his predecessor, Iain Duncan Smith. With Washington one of the few places he was taken seriously - he still loves popping over for meetings with Dick Cheney and other neo-cons - IDS was even more pro-war than Mr Blair, leaving his successor little room for manoeuvre.</p> <p>\"Ken Clarke, IDS's former rival for the Tory crown, offered an alternative course, arguing that the party should oppose any military adventures that were not clearly in Britain's national interest. How many Tories must wish he'd been leading them now.</p> <p>\"Mr Blair's confidence, however, has a firmer foundation than Tory misjudgement. Following John Howard's election win in Australia and George Bush's poll lead in the US, he is convinced that Iraq is not an election-winning - or losing - issue.\"</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; ORIGINAL SPIN?</p> <p>A reader emailed the Backbencher with shocking news. Don't tell central office, readers, but 'Saatchi's Law' - otherwise known as \"Satisfaction = Performance minus Expectation\" - is not the work of the legendary adman.</p> <p>\"Sorry, but Maurice didn't 'come up' with this one (S = P - E),\" writes a man whom, for his own safety, we'll call John. \"It has been around for donkey's years. It's usually given the handle 'The first law of services' and I first came across it back in the 70s at a conference on 'Production &amp; Operations Management' in a paper presented by a brilliant American, name of David Maister.\"</p> <p>This all seemed most unlikely. Surely Maurice would never pass off someone else's idea as his own? The Backbencher consulted another reader, who said: \"He's broadly right but exactly wrong. It's Maister's first law of service (not services), and says that Service = Perception - Expectation.</p> <p>\"Saatchi, like the adman he is, rebranded slightly when plagiarising to Satisfaction = Performance - Expectation. Both changes are actually significant.\"</p> <p>Frankly, the Backbencher expected better of Lord Saatchi. No wonder Silky spent much of last week talking about the public's low expectations of him, and his own modest ambitions. </p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION</p> <p>As many readers pointed out, Maurice Saatchi compared his washing machine to the functions of a successful government at last week's conference.</p> <p>\"So, Saatchi likens a good government to his washing machine, yet fails to mention the endless spinning,\" writes the winner, Phil Thomas. \"Incidentally, one of his agency's major clients happens to be the Dixons Group, purveyor of all goods white.\" It all joins up at the back, you know, Phil. Fortunately, it's someone else's job to do that.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION</p> <p>The Backbencher has a copy of Agnes Maillot's New Sinn Fein: Republicanism after the IRA to give away, courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.routledge.com\">Routledge</a>, to the reader who can tell her why the \"Big\" D Mocracy band is playing at a \"speed dating\" event between \"young people\" (defined as under 26, though the Backbencher may try to get in anyway) and councillors next week.

The Tories seem to be trying to do it in six minutes - and without any kind of parliamentary legislation,\" wrote a prophetic reader early last night. How right he turned out to be. For on Wednesday at 10pm it came to pass that the Conservatives' <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/getfile.cfm?file=timetableforaction&amp;ref=POLICYDOCUMENT/1664&amp;type=pdf\">Timetable for Action</a> was loosed upon the world.</p> <p>Like Genesis, the Backbencher suspects that this remarkable document need not be taken entirely literally, but it still tells us a great deal about the glory of elected office. Admittedly, too, God's first priority was switching on the light rather than making the Office for National Statistics independent of ministers, but since the very first pledge is, in fact, a negative commitment (\"I will forbid party political advisers to tell civil servants what to do\"), it may take a bit longer to fulfil the rest. Who is going to tell the political advisers not to boss about the civil servants in the ONS? Silky, presumably. And he won't be able to delegate it. Really, promising to keep Guy Black's paws off the ONS doesn't quite have the same force as Gordon's liberation of the Bank of England. </p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; LEFT WELL ALONE</p> <p>How pleasing that Peter Mandelson made such a good impression on the MEPs who interviewed him last week about his new job as an European commissioner. Enrique Baron Crespo, who chaired the hearing, judged his \"personal and professional capacities\" highly after the three-hour grilling. The only politicians who did not warm to him were those in the European United Left group, not the sort of people he has ever tried to cultivate. Let's just hope he gets on with his new colleague Rocco Buttiglione as well.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; A QUESTION OF INTELLIGENCE</p> <p>The Backbencher urges Tony Blair to take a leaf out of David Beckham's book. Chastised for his professional foul on Welsh international Ben Thatcher on Saturday, the England captain was not too proud to apologise. \"I now know that was wrong and apologise to the Football Association, the England manager, my team-mates and all England fans for this,\" he admitted. How much the PM could learn from such repentance. \"I am sure some people think I have not got the brains to be that clever,\" said Mr Beckham, \"but I do have the brains. I could feel the injury, so I fouled Thatcher. It was deliberate.\" So that's settled: Goldenballs' intelligence is fine, but Mr Blair's remains faulty - another triumph for the cock-up theory of history.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; TOLERANCE, TORY-STYLE</p> <p>Michael Portillo did not do much to further the Tories' attempts to be more inclusive on his BBC4 chat show last night. Discussing the rise of Islamophobia, the former cabinet minister said: \"10 years ago we'd have been having the same conversation amongst Irish people. And it's not wholly unreasonable for people to look for Muslim people when there's a threat from people who are quoting the Koran.\" How reassuring for the hundreds of British Muslims who have been picked up in anti-terrorist raids and then released without charge. And how reassuring for the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four that they had nothing to moan about.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS</p> <p>\"The Speaker tells Plaid Cymru's Adam Price - who wants Mr Blair to be impeached - to 'calm down or leave the chamber'.

  "<p>Around the time of the Democratic convention in Boston, the first such event to accredit bloggers, there was a great deal of introspective posting on what the new breed of fearless internet warriors would be doing differently from the other 15,000 media people there. One view was nothing much - bloggers being intrinsically parasitic to the big newspapers and TV stations, filtering and analysing the latest stories instead of generating them. As Wonkette emailed to <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64273,00.html\">Wired magazine</a>: \"Reporting is something you have to leave your laptop to do.\"</p> <p>But one thing bloggers can do differently, if not better, than their mainstream rivals is organisation. You saw it in the Howard Dean campaign when a web momentum built up behind an outside candidate; in the latest attempt, pro-Kerry bloggers are mobilising against a conservative-leaning US television station that plans to show a documentary attacking the senator in the last 10 days of the campaign.</p> <p>The effort is based around the <a href=\"http://www.boycottsbg.com/\">Boycott Sinclair Broadcast Group</a> website. It charges that <a href=\"http://www.stolenhonor.com/\">Stolen Honor</a>, a film linking Mr Kerry's campaign against the Vietnam war to the torture of captured US soliders, is more \"partisan propaganda\" than documentary. Readers are asked to persuade advertisers to withdraw their spending from the group and its regional affiliates.</p> <p>It has scored some successes. A <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/10/12/121355/52#235#235\">thread</a> at Daily Kos lists the most recent and one firm, Carroll's Furniture of Arden Hills, Minnesota, gets some applause. \"If I lived in Minnesota I'd be a customer for life,\" writes one organiser.</p> <p>The Democratic party is pursuing Sinclair through the courts for flouting federal election guidelines but one thing bloggers want to know is where the mainstream media are in all of this. Dave Pell at <strong>Electablog</strong> cannot quite believe it. \"It's these same media organisations who have allowed themselves to be slapped around enough by the phoney charges of liberal bias that they've become unable to perform their duty as a check on the balance of power in this country,\" he <a href=\"http://www.electablog.com/2004/10/time-for-big-media-to-join-fight.html\">writes</a>.</p> <p>\"The airing of a partisan hack job on Sinclair's stations will not only mark a sick victory for rabid right wingers. It will also plunge another dagger into the heart of a mainstream press seemingly unable or unwilling to defend itself.\"</p> <p>The pro-Bush <strong>Little Green Footballs</strong> is less than amused but spies an opportunity in the advertisers' database. \"[We] may be able to discover ways to contact these advertisers ourselves, and let them know that we want them to support Sinclair's constitutionally protected right to free speech,\" it suggests. A little closer to newsblog's own heart, LGF has a similar plan for the Guardian's <a href=\"http://guardian.assets.digivault.co.uk/clark_county/\">letter writing campaign</a> to the undecided voters of Clark County, Ohio. \"Make sure to go to the Guardian site and sign up for one of the addresses of the voters. That way it will be removed from being given to the wacko libs,\" reads the first <a href=\"http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=13128_Guardian_Tries_to_Influence_US_Election#comments\">first comment</a>. \"Then, if you are so moved, write a letter to the person urging them to vote for President Bush. We can turn this against the Guardian and the unscrupulous liberals.\"</p> <p>Unscrupulous or not, weblogs are sure to use these next six weeks to see how much power they really have.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\" http://media.theguardian.com/overnights/story/0,7965,1326292,00.html\"> huge viewing figures</a> announced today for the first episode of Who Do You Think You Are? - the new series in which celebrities trace their ancestry - reflect the recent surge of interest in genealogy.</p> <p>More than 5 million people - twice the average BBC2 audience at least - tuned in to the programme last night, suggesting the internet-fuelled boom in family history is far from over.</p> <p>Before rushing to the local library or checking out the many websites devoted to the subject (see below), however, there are a few things every would-be family historian should do to ensure their research gets off to a flying start.</p> <p>The most important, according to Steve Thomas, of the leading genealogy agency <a href=\"http://www.achievements.co.uk/services/gretna/index.php\"> Achievements</a> is to talk to your relatives. </p> <p>An afternoon spent dragging long-forgotten information from the recesses of Great Aunt Edna's mind might sound like a chore, but it could turn up vital information.</p> <p>\"Start by talking to older members of the family, but try not to interrogate them too much,\" says Mr Thomas. \"And don't rely on just one source - if you have two elderly uncles you can talk to independently, you might get a better overall picture.\"</p> <p>As far as technique is concerned, he advises: \"If they struggle to recall certain memories, the main thing is not to ask them leading questions but to give them clues.</p> <p>\"For instance, if they can't remember the date something happened, try to get a rough idea rather than pin them down to a specific year. Ask them: 'Was it before or after the war?' or another big event, and they are more likely to remember.\" </p> <p>Relatives may also help you dig up valuable material that could save you a lot of time in the long run. </p> <p>\"Ask about any family documents: birth certificates, soldiers' letters home. A very important source is often the family Bible because in Victorian times they had a section for recording births, marriages and burials. These records often spanned many generations.\"</p> <p>Once you have a framework of your family history, it is important to \"get it down to pedigree\", or put it in a graphical form, such as a family tree. Whether working on computer or paper, allow yourself space to fill in details between entries as you go along.</p> <p>For many amateur genealogists, there is often a limit to how much research they can get hold of or assess - particularly when trying to trace overseas roots. At that point, Mr Thomas advises, it is worth calling in a professional. </p> <p>In the meantime, here are some pointers to online resources.</p> <p> <strong>Free sites</strong></p> <p><a href=\" http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/familyhistory/\"> The National Archives</a> allows you to search wills from 1384 to 1858 (free search, charged download), 1901 census records (free search, charged download) and records about migration (free search, free download). </p> <p>You can also search <a href=\"http://www.catalogue.nationalarchives.gov.uk/default.asp\"> the Catalogue</a>, which contains almost 10m descriptions of documents from central government, courts of law and other UK national bodies, including records on family history, medieval tax, criminal trials, UFO sightings and many other subjects.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.familyrecords.gov.uk/frc/\"> The Family Records Centre </a>provides access to some of the most important sources for family history research in England and Wales, including <a href=\" http://www.familyrecords.gov.uk/frc/research/bmdmain.htm\"> births, marriages and deaths</a> and <a href=\"http://www.familyrecords.gov.uk/frc/research/censusmain.htm\"> census returns</a>. </p> <p><a href=\" http://www.1901census.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ \"> The 1901 census</a> is the most recent to be made available online as a searchable database.

  "<p>A police officer with huge debts and a council finance chief were today jailed for a \"mean and shabby\" attempt to a defraud a government scheme set up to help disadvantaged children.</p> <p>The pair were convinced their \"sophisticated\" plot, which centred on creaming off tens of thousands of pounds intended for after school clubs, would make them \"rich\". </p> <p>At one point detective constable Kurtis Mwadikwa-Jonathan, 38, of Lincoln Road, Slade Green, south London, who was given 18 months, was heard gloating about his forthcoming \"financial freedom\". </p> <p>Meanwhile, his partner in crime, Uche Wogu, who was sentenced to two years, was busy planning a trip to his native Nigeria. </p> <p>Throughout it all they hid behind an array of false names and addresses while doing their best to conceal their \"close friendship\", London's Middlesex Guildhall crown court heard.</p> <p>But despite all their planning, some of the officer's colleagues discovered what they were up to and began tapping their phone conversations. </p> <p>They were eventually arrested just days after the London borough of Hackney decided to give them \u00a3110,000 of taxpayers' cash. </p> <p>Both initially denied any wrongdoing, but faced with the overwhelming evidence against them, realised they had no choice but to confess. </p> <p>Wogu, 38, of Frederick Crescent, Enfield, north London, a business and finance support manager for the local authority, admitted two counts of misconduct in public office, while his fellow countryman, based with the CID in Newham, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting him. </p> <p>They stood with heads bowed as Judge Derek Inman told them: \"On any point of view these were dishonest, mean and shabby activities, and you both, with your education and background in finance and the police, must have fully realised that.\"</p>",
  "<p>It may be the favoured brand among a certain element of football fans, but international expansion and the launch of its Burberry Brit men's fragrance means everything is still coming up roses at Burberry.</p> <p>Rose Marie Bravo, the UK group's chief executive, today delivered a first half trading update, ahead of interim results next month. The American, who has recently extended her contract until July 2006, reported a 14% rise in underlying first-half sales to \u00a3367m. </p> <p>The company, famed for its check raincoats and accessories, has opened new stores in the US and Korea, accounting for much of the growth. It said the contribution from existing stores had been only marginal. Ms Bravo put Burberry's performance down to its \"balanced strategy by product, channel and region\".</p> <p>Finance director Stacey Cartwright said the \"London-centric UK market\" was quiet during the first half, but that the Hong Kong branch had performed exceptionally, with Chinese tourists emptying shelves.</p> <p>\"We're seeing a strong performance with Chinese tourists crossing over the border to Hong Kong, and literally queuing outside the door,\" she said. </p> <p>Wholesale revenues - principally sales through department stores - accounted for 57% of total income, and increased by 13% on an underlying basis. Licensing revenues also strengthened, helped by gains in Japan and launch of the new men's fragrance.</p> <p>\"We were particularly encouraged by the 31% gain in our licensing channel, partially driven by the highly successful launch of Burberry Brit for men,\" Ms Bravo said. </p> <p>The company recently entered a new fragrance-licensing deal with existing partner Inter Parfums SA, which will lead to a substantially higher royalty rate. </p> <p>Burberry said its first-half performance was consistent with expectations for the financial year. Analysts expect it to post annual pre-tax profits of \u00a3160m. Last year's profits were \u00a3139m, up from \u00a385.1m the previous year.</p> <p>But while the numbers were in line with market forecasts, some analysts remarked on the split between a disappointing retail performance and strength in wholesale, licensing and fragrances.</p> <p>\"Overall the numbers were good but we see no reason to touch our full-year estimates at this point,\" Goldman Sachs said in a research note. \"The successful brand repositioning is translating into a strong growth platform to expand retail, move into new regions and expand the product offering into accessories; but we see more valuation upside in the sector right now.\" </p> <p>Shares in Burberry, which is two thirds owned by Great Universal Stores, were up 7p at 371p at 4pm.</p>",
  "<p><strong>BEST LAID PLANS</strong></p> <p>The Fiver is a past master in good-ideas-turned bad. After all, we still cringe at the memory of handing over every penny we had to our now-incarcerated Nigerian cousin Dr Franklin Fiver-Agaba IV (\"I have a tremendous business opportunity, all I need are your bank details...\"). So we had an ounce of sympathy for David Beckham today, when he finally issued a grovelling apology for admitting he deliberately got himself booked against Wales.</p> <p>\"I was asked a question and made a frank admission to counter the negative speculation [about being a spoilt brat who can't control my temper],\" said Beckham, whose perfect day was sealed when he was condemned by Fifa chief Sepp Blatherer before being ruled out for a month with rib-knack. \"I now know that was wrong and apologise to the FA, the England manager, my team-mates and all England fans for this,\" he sobbed. \"I made a mistake.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile over in Azerbaijan - and to nobody's great surprise - Jermaine Jenas has been named as Beckham's replacement.

  "<p>'British Pregnancy Advisory Service helps women get illegal abortions,\" the Sunday Telegraph announced this week. It was followed up with a five-page special investigation under the headline: \"NHS-funded charity sends hundreds to Spain for terminations of healthy foetuses 'up to 30 weeks'.\" </p> <p>Well, perhaps that would be a scandal, if it were true - but it isn't. Bpas, of which I am chief executive, does not help women get \"illegal\" abortions, and it does not \"send\" women to Spain. </p> <p>Each year, Bpas, Britain's leading provider of abortion care, helps 50,000 women with abortions. We are also called by about 100 others who have passed the 24-week gestation limit. We tell them abortion is no longer a legal option in Britain. Most accept this and we advise on how to access antenatal care. But, a tiny number (and the figure is closer to dozens rather than the hundreds reported by the Sunday Telegraph) - for all manner of complex reasons - can't imagine any other option. </p> <p>There is no one reason why a woman requests a late termination. It might be that her husband has abandoned her; she might be close to the menopause and her periods so erratic she didn't know that she was pregnant. She could be a teenager who put off telling anyone in the hope that the problem would go away. It's not an easy option. It usually involves a medical induction and a woman giving birth to a dead baby. It is the hardest of hard decisions. </p> <p>Faced with people who are so driven they will pay any price, travel any distance, do anything to end an unwanted pregnancy, our staff do what they can to help within the law. They give telephone numbers of clinics that provide safe, legal abortions in countries with laws different to our own. We do not \"refer\" women to foreign clinics, we do not \"vouch\" for these clinics, and nor do we have financial links with them. All we do is: confirm that such clinics exist and that we believe they provide safe services. And we give contact numbers when women want them. This has been Bpas practice for more than a decade: it is not a secret, and it has never raised the proverbial eyebrow. </p> <p>It can come as no shock to policy makers that some British women travel overseas for abortions. Before the abortion pill was legal in the US, American women came to use it in Britain. Now some British women travel to the US (and to Europe) for late abortions that are not permitted here. </p> <p>In the light of this, it is surprising that the health secretary John Reid has reacted to the Sunday Telegraph's trumped-up expose by agreeing that an investigation into the matter is appropriate. But, although questionable, it is not unwelcome. We are more than happy to cooperate with any investigation into the treatment of women with late gestation \"problem pregnancies\". </p> <p>You may think it is right for us to provide international contact details, or you may think it is wrong. But it has never been alleged, until now, that it is illegal for us to provide such information. So, let us establish, once and for all, beyond question whether British women have a lawful right to information about foreign services, and whether they have a lawful right to travel to obtain services abroad that are not legal in their country of origin. This, after all, has been central to the Irish abortion debate for the last decade. </p> <p>And let government ministers also pay attention to the real scandal that's going on here. The real \"late\" abortion scandal is that women legally entitled to late abortion care here cannot get it - because there are not enough appointments to go round. Bpas provides more than 80% of procedures after 20 weeks because other providers have opted out of providing a difficult service. It is hard to recruit doctors, nurses and midwives to work in abortion. At Bpas we struggle to maintain an unpopular service that, we believe, women need - if we didn't, how many more women would feel forced to travel abroad? </p> <p>The Sunday Telegraph editorial this week claimed that Bpas \"views the provision of abortion through crusaders eyes\" and cites as evidence my personal view that no recent scientific developments in our understanding of the foetus have changed women's need for late abortion services. I confess: personally, I believe that women should have access to abortion as early as possible and as late as necessary. But Bpas, the organisation that I am privileged to run, is an abortion provider, and not a campaigning organisation. We do our best to provide a safe and sympathetic service within the law, and to relieve the distress of women with unwanted pregnancy. I wonder if the Sunday Telegraph has a similar moral compass.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ann Furedi is chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas)</p>",
  "Work on a new control room and additional CCTV is underway in the Whitehall and Westminster area to boost security outside parliament, the home secretary, David Blunkett, said today. <p>The move follows growing alarm after a series of security scares at the Palace of Westminster. </p> <p>A review of security in the parliamentary estate is already being conducted by the Security Service and Metropolitan Police. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett has also commissioned a report on security outside the Palace and its immediate environs. </p> <p>In a written statement to MPs, he explained: \"Operational police deployments have already been increased to counter the potential threat of vehicle bombs. </p> <p>\"In addition, I have already agreed further enhancements to the support for operational policing of the area including work on a new control room and CCTV.\" </p> <p>Discussions will take place with the London mayor, Transport for London and Westminster city council on whether further protection measures were required. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett said an amendment had been tabled to the civil contingencies bill to make it easier for police to control traffic around Parliament in the event of a terrorist threat. </p> <p>He insisted there were no plans for major road closures at present. </p> <p>But consultation was underway on the \"consequences of and options for changes to management of traffic around parliament should further restrictions become necessary,\" he added. </p> <p>\"I believe this is essential if we are to safeguard and enhance not just the security of the area but also its economic and social well-being.\"</p>",
  "Shares in the oil giant Yukos today continued to slide amid concerns that the Russian government would sell part of a key subsidiary cheaply in order to finance the company's huge tax debt. <p>The Russian justice ministry yesterday announced a possible sale of Yukos's Siberian unit, Yugansk, prompting analysts to speculate that it would go - at a vastly undervalued price - to a state-backed company such as the gas monopoly Gazprom.</p> <p>The government has been pursuing Yukos - which produces around 2% of the world's oil - over alleged tax avoidance for almost a year. </p> <p>Mikhail Khordorkovsky, the former Yukos chief executive who has backed political opposition groups in Russia, has been in prison since last October, charged with fraud and tax evasion. He faces up to 10 years in jail.</p> <p>The action against Yukos is seen by many as revenge by the Kremlin for the billionaire Mr Khordokovsky's growing political clout ahead of last year's presidential elections. However, the government claims it is merely clamping down on shady business practices and tax avoidance schemes.</p> <p>Tax officials claim the company owes $8.35bn (\u00a34.7bn), of which it has so far paid around $3bn. With its bank accounts frozen by court order, Yukos's hands are somewhat tied, but the Russian justice ministry has said the bill is not being paid quickly enough.</p> <p>The ministry has now said assets must be sold through the Russian Federal Property Fund, and believes Yugansk to be worth $10.4bn. The fund said it thought a sale could be completed by the end of November.</p> <p>Government officials hired Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein to value Yugansk - which accounts for around 60% of Yukos output - during the summer. The investment bank is thought to have valued the business at between $15.7bn and $18.3bn. </p> <p>Dresdner's report also apparently included the $10.4bn valuation, although it said it considered that to be overly conservative. Nevertheless, the figure was seized upon by justice ministry official Alexander Buksman, who was quoted by local news agencies as saying that Dresdner had \"applied a 60% discount given high risks for potential buyers\".</p> <p>The news sent Yukos dollar shares, which have already fallen by 70% since Mr Khordokovsky's arrest, down 5% yesterday and a further 10% today.</p> <p>Some analysts now expect Yukos to sue both Dresdner and the Russian government in international courts over the valuation figure.</p> <p>Vladimir Ryzhkov, an independent member of the Duma - Russia's lower house of parliament - today called for a debate on the matter.</p> <p>\"The government hasn't given the company a chance to pay, but it accuses it of not paying,\" he told Ekho Moscow radio. \"The state is behaving like a bandit. This is a blatant violation of the law - it is time for parliament to discuss the question.\"</p> <p>He added, however, that he expected the request to be turned down by the Kremlin-controlled United Russia party, which dominates the Duma.</p>",

  "A US-led team of investigators working in northern Iraq has discovered a mass grave containing hundreds of bodies, including that of an infant with a gunshot to the back of the head. <p>The skeletons of foetuses, children clutching toys and men apparently killed by machine-gun fire were amongst the dead found in nine trenches in a dry riverbed in the village of Hatra. </p> <p>The investigators have been conducting what is believed to be the first scientific investigation of a mass grave as they look for evidence to use against former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. They believe the dead may be Kurds killed between 1987 and 1988.</p> <p>\"It is my personal opinion that this is a killing field,\" said Greg Kehoe, an American working with the Iraqi Special Tribunal, an independent body looking for evidence of genocide and other atrocities linked to Saddam, who is expected to face trial next year.</p> <p>\"Someone used this field on significant occasions over time to take bodies up there, and to take people up there and execute them.\"</p> <p>\"I have been doing grave sites for a long time, but I have never seen anything like this, women and children executed for no apparent reason,\" Mr Kehoe, who was involved in the prosecution of Bosnian war criminals, said. \"It's a perfect place for execution.\" </p> <p>Conservative estimates put the number of people killed during Saddam's 24-year rule at 300,000, with US officials so far confirming 40 grave sites out of a possible 260.</p> <p>Saddam is accused of widespread abuse against the Kurds, including the Anfal genocide in 1988, when, according to Human Rights Watch, he is alleged to have ordered the killing of some 100,000 Kurds. </p> <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair told parliament today that the mass graves in Iraq were proof that Saddam's regime had to be removed. \"I will not apologise for removing Saddam Hussein.

  "<p>I was wandering round an architectural salvage place - so useful if you fancy a few pews - and opened a cupboard. Inside swung a skeleton. I can still hear the sound of myself not breathing. <strong> Who Do You Think You Are?</strong> (BBC2) is a bright idea and quite original in my experience. Ten celebrities will trace their family history, encounter unsuspected skeletons and investigate their rude forefathers, some ruder than others. Jeremy Clarkson is a scion of the Kilner jar fortune (it is remarkable how many of us would have been rich but for something or other) and Vic Reeves's grandfather was a bigamist. You can always rely on Victorians to blot the escutcheon a bit. My great-grandfather was followed to the grave by carriages full of grieving ladies of the night and, as my grandmother would say with considerable satisfaction, \"No man raised his hat as they passed\". They may, perhaps, have been hiding their faces. </p> <p>The discovery of wholly unsuspected hanky-panky lets daylight into situations which never quite made sense. There is, for instance, the little matter of my cousin, Percy. You wish you had been trusted with the truth earlier. </p> <p>The first one in the deep end was Bill Oddie. He lost his mother when he was about 10 and was brought up by his grandmother. She was not a genial presence. Bill escaped the house to watch birds, a classic symbol of freedom. </p> <p>Lilian Oddie was in a lunatic asylum. They wouldn't have told Bill that. Ask no questions and you'll be told no lies, as they used to say. At first she used to come home, but one day she was dragged away screaming. Her nurses remembered her as always jolly, always happy and very musical. Fans of The Funky Gibbon will remember that Bill Oddie was the only Goodie who could actually sing and dance. </p> <p>He started to ask questions when he recently suffered two bouts of clinical depression, the comic's occupational risk. He said: \"This isn't curiosity. It's self-help.\" </p> <p>When you find your family, you may find them at eachother's throats. Sixty years on, his Auntie Margery went for his grandmother like a grandmother-seeking missile. According to Margery, her sister Lilian was committed for threatening her mother-in-law. \"That was your grandmother's doing. Nag, nag, nag. She was always there, your grandmother. That was the trouble.\" She also told Bill about an unsuspected sister, who died at only five days old because his grandmother wouldn't let his mother go to the crying child. The death certificate said inanition. Empty, undernourished, dehydrated. </p> <p>So he looked into his grandmother's background. She had been a Lancashire weaver since she was 13. It was a cruel school. Bow legs were common and the din so deafening that weavers had to lip read. She must have been as tough as the clogs she wore to survive. Any sign of sickness and you were told not to be mard. I don't even know how that is spelled, I have only heard it spoken. Many times. </p> <p>In Rochdale, Bill encountered an identical Oddie. Perhaps a fraction furrier. They could have sat on either side of a pond fishing companiably. \"I've always wanted to ask,\" said the furrier gnome, \"if your second toe is longer than your big toe.\" It was. </p> <p><strong>ONE Life</strong> (BBC1) was about the Jackson family. Andy Jackson was so young you smiled at the sight of him. He had felt rough for some time but, being 19 and exuberant, put it down to hangovers or crap food. \"To be told you've got leukaemia, it just went wham! Blooming 'eck! And then you're off in a flashing ambulance to Hammersmith Hospital. I was so upset for mum.\" </p> <p>Sandy, his mother, was in the last stages of terminal cancer but grittily determined not to die until she was sure he would live. His father, who, as Andy put it, was in some mad place in the middle, offered tissues, bacon sandwiches and jokes as required. They were such extraordinary people you were pleased that the producer, Jonathan Smith, had done such an extraordinarily good job. </p> <p>After chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a marrow transplant, it takes a fortnight for the first healthy white blood cell to appear. If the transplant fails, it won't show. Andy's mother was now floating in and out of his room like a ghost but, when he developed that crucial white blood cell in 10 days, she sparkled like Christmas. </p> <p>Then, having seen his salvation, she died.</p>",
  "<b> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday October 16 2004</b> <br>  Terry Sanderson has asked us to clarify some of his remarks that we attribute to him in the article below. He did not say that there was a problem with next-of-kin rights for same-sex partners when one was in hospital. What he said was that there used to be a problem. He also wants us to make clear that he did not say that there are no provisions for gay couples to inherit pensions. Many pension funds have changed their rules to make this possible. <b>Erika N, 27, and Erika V, 25, have been together for five years and moved to Britain from the US in September 2003. They live together in Chorlton, Manchester.</b> <p><b>Their verdict</b><br> It makes us feel like whole citizens. The previous legislation was effectively penalising us because of our sexual preference. It was the same feeling as for people who a decade ago were discriminated against for the colour of their skin. </p> <p>Since we moved here I have been quite surprised by how liberal England is. As a child I had a picture of the stiff upper lip and didn't regard it as a liberal place. </p> <p>The civil partnership bill is about a feeling of being accepted in society and not feeling that we are being judged and not feeling like a second-class citizen. </p> <p><b>Legal impact</b><br> We met in America when we were students at Smith College. To be frank, if we were a heterosexual couple then we could have married and the very next day we would have been entitled to stay in the country. </p> <p>I have heard some horror stories about a same-sex couple: two men. One passed away without amending his will. His partner was left with absolutely nothing and his partner's family were not being sympathetic. I really do think that this civil partnership bill will cover these kinds of scenarios and prevent them. </p> <p><b>Financial impact</b><br> We do not have the figures of how much we will be better off but at least we will be entitled to the same treatment. It is absolutely ridiculous that we are not entitled to the same inheritance and tax benefits. </p> <p>I am not sure how much we will be affected now - we already have a joint bank account and we live together in rented accommodation. </p> <p>If I knew I was entitled to the same inheritance and tax rights as everyone else then I would not have had to think about it so much. But from a young age I have been thinking about what would happen when we got older. </p> <p><b>Terry Sanderson, 57, and Keith Wood, 56 have been together for 23 years. They live in Ealing, west London.</b> </p> <p><b>Their verdict</b><br> We would have preferred to have been given equality and been allowed to get married using marriage registration available to everyone else instead of being given a completely different form of partnership right. </p> <p>It will not affect the quality of our relationship from an emotional point of view. We've been together 23 years. </p> <p>We feel our relationship is perfectly legitimate in its own terms from an emotional perspective and friends and family, and we don't have to prove it to everyone. They know it's real. </p> <p>Younger gay couples want to be acknowledged and recognised as a couple. </p> <p><b>Legal impact</b><br> Hopefully this will mean a change to next-of-kin rights. At the moment there is family only allowed in the hospital. Also it should mean we are able to make claims on each other's property and inherited tenancy rights. </p> <p>The bill should also mean our wills should not be challenged, rather they will be treated as the will of a partner, like in a marriage. </p> <p><b>Financial impact</b><br> We are anxious that the inheritance tax will be no longer an issue for us and that it will be treated as it would be with a married couple. There will also be an improvement in the way pensions are dealt with, as at the moment there are no provisions on inheriting pensions for gay couples.</p>",
  "<p>Always keen on art, 11-year-old Kenny Porritt now carries his sketch book wherever he goes, proud to show his increasingly confident drawings to school friends. </p> <p>The sketch book came from the Guy Fox History Project, a small south London charity that uses art and its creation to bring the city's heritage and culture to life for children in the borough of Southwark, where landmarks range from the Dulwich picture gallery and the Old Kent Road to the Globe theatre. </p> <p>Kenny, from Bermondsey, got involved in workshops to create an interactive CD of famous Southwark figures. \"Mine was Harold Moody, a Jamaican doctor who helped sick people and also fought racism,\" he says. \"I researched about him and found his picture in a newspaper to make a drawing. It was hard work and good fun.\" </p> <p>His mother, Emma Roach, adds: \"Kenny's very proud of what he has achieved, and thoroughly enjoyed it. He was able to focus and concentrate on the work, and the whole process has given him confidence and brought him out of himself. He has always doodled, but now he has his sketch book with him all the time. There's been a good impact at school, and the other kids ask to see his drawings.\" </p> <p>With its eponymous cartoon fox figure and revealing tag line, \"history on the sly\", the Guy Fox History Project was started in 2000 by illustrator Kourtney Harper, now its voluntary creative director. </p> <p>Aided by many artistic volunteers - including design professionals who have worked on the Harry Potter films - school and community workshops for children have poured out a multimedia kaleidoscope of CDs, maps, magazines, posters and websites. These are distributed free to thousands of children via schools and libraries, so that both the process and the products are entertaining and educational. </p> <p>While Guy Fox has no staff and runs on a series of small grants, worth just \u00a338,000 in its most recent published accounts, the project does not skimp on the essentials. These range from a sophisticated portable studio, with which children can record songs, stories and interviews, to a detailed seven-page policy for child protection. </p> <p>The Guardian award, providing a boost for the charity's confidence and commitment, was described as an \"honourtunity\" by Harper. \"It was an honour to win such a prestigious award and an opportunity to tell a national audience about our work, our philosophy and our creative vision. The Guy Fox History Project started with a tiny mission - to publish an illustrated history magazine for children - but we expanded our work because children wanted to participate in the creative process. This award is an endorsement of their enthusiasm and commitment.\" </p> <p>The project's workshops help children aged nine to 13 to develop a sense of history, acquire new skills and feel more confident. Given a sketchbook and asked to draw every day, \"suddenly they're looking at the world around them, engaging with it, and truly studying the things that surround them,\" Harper says. </p> <p>In terms familiar to anyone running a small charity, she talks about the challenges of constantly researching charity law, children's rights, organisational development, grant proposal writing, finance and administration and new technology. </p> <p>\"People get involved in charity work because they want to change the world,\" Harper says. \"Maybe they don't change the entire world, but, at the very least, they change their own. It is hugely rewarding.\" </p> <p>The project will use the award to try to find commercial opportunities to become a self-sustaining social enterprise. \"We can now accelerate our vision for the future and bring forward our plans for sustaining our charity work through business development,\" Harper says. \"We'll hire a development expert to help us build our organisation so that we can cultivate opportunities that are restricted by our current structure.\" </p> <p>The National History Museum, Lewisham Historical Society and Starbucks Coffee have either used Guy Fox to create publications or asked about the project producing children's materials for them. </p> <p>The computer will be used to consolidate the project's databases, archives, accounts and records, which will streamline administration and allow more volunteers to get involved. </p> <p>Harper says the aim is to empower children. \"One day, in the not-so-distant future, a young person will walk into our office with an idea for a project that is more innovative than anything we've ever imagined,\" she says. \"On that day, if we have the capacity and financial strength to say 'sure, let's do it,' that will be a perfect day.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Guy Fox History Project is at <a href=\"http://www.guyfox.org.uk\">www.guyfox.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A noticeboard in a Dumfries car park proudly lists the reasons why the town is judged the best place to live in Britain. Its virtues include an Olympic-size ice rink, two museums and more than 350 shops. </p> <p>Mysteriously overlooked is the luxury of a home help service available to anyone who claims to be unable to reach those retail opportunities. </p> <p>\"We're not very good at checking,\" Michelle McCrindle briskly acknowledges in her office. Bureaucracy is not the Food Train's style. \"Some organisations have to produce paper till it comes out of their ears. Maybe we should ask people if they're really elderly, housebound or disabled, but I think that is horrendously off-putting.\" She pauses. \"If they've lifted the phone to ask for help, that's good enough for us.\" </p> <p>The Food Train was established nine years ago after a survey of Dumfries pensioners showed that many were literally struggling with their groceries. A simple system was set up whereby volunteers would, for \u00a31 a time, collect shopping lists and return in the next day or so with deliveries assembled by cooperating retailers. The formula proved so popular that the organisation now runs 6,500 errands a year for 300 immobile customers across 2,500 square miles of rolling south-west Scotland. The Queen reportedly considers their work \"wonderful\". </p> <p>By the office door glints what McCrindle calls \"a dod of crystal\" - Her Majesty's Jubilee Award for voluntary service in the community. </p> <p>McCrindle, 32, was appointed Food Train development officer in 2002. The former psychiatric nurse radiates efficiency laced with indignation. \"I think it's disgraceful that local authorities don't provide this service,\" she says. \"I had no idea they didn't until I started here.\" In fact, Help the Aged calculates that 460,000 of Britain's 1.1 million over-85s cannot shop unaided. </p> <p>More than half of the Food Train's clients are not monitored by any other service. The youngest is 40, while 67% are over 75. One farmtrack hermit previously relied on the RSPCA to deliver supplies. </p> <p>McCrindle plans to diversify the Food Train's activities to include various errands and odd jobs, such as letter collection and window cleaning. \"The help should be there when people need it,\" she says, \"not when they are about to be carted off to hospital.\" </p> <p>The idea is far from new. The sons of the ancient Greeks were obliged by law to look after their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. However, the elderly have often been last in line for community support. William Beveridge, in his 1942 report, cautioned: \"It is dangerous to be in any way lavish to old age until adequate provision has been made for all other vital needs.\" </p> <p>This sort of institutionalised prejudice infuriates McCrindle, who tours the country spreading the word about the Food Train. But only Midlothian has followed the Dumfries lead so far. </p> <p>\"It is disgraceful,\" she says. \"Why should we have fewer rights when we become older than when we are fit and well?\" She dismisses many government social action schemes as \"just reinventing the wheel\". </p> <p>The good news is that five supermarket chains and 20 other shops across Dumfries and Galloway have agreed to make up Food Train orders. </p> <p>The office door opens and a young man eases into a chair, balancing one trainer on top of another. \"Alan is one of our helpers . . . very good with computers,\" McCrindle says beamingly. </p> <p>Alan, 22, shrugs modestly: \"I just like the sense of doing something.\" </p> <p>This capacity for adding purpose to the lives of 70 volunteers - many retired themselves - helped persuade Dumfries and Galloway council in 2002 to commit \u00a3127,000 of Scottish executive funds to the previously self-financing Food Train over three years. This pays for five branches, six vans and McCrindle's salary. </p> <p>Jean Elgar, who runs the Guide Services for Older Folk programme, says it has been \"an absolutely brilliant\" investment. The Guardian prize money will probably be spent on a new vehicle. The computer that accompanies the cash has been earmarked for the organisation's Annan office, 10 miles from the English border, over which southern retirees swarm in their hundreds each year. </p> <p>\"If you haven't been here for 60 years, you don't have a natural network,\" McCrindle observes. There is a certain irony in this. According to a council focus group, the main reason for settling in south-west Scotland is the distance it puts between settlers and their families. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Food Train is at <a href=\"http://www.thefoodtrain.co.uk\">www.thefoodtrain.co.uk</a></p>",

  "An appeal to raise \u00a36m to fund trials of a revolutionary treatment for heart disease using stem cells was launched today. <p>Barts and the London NHS Trust wants to take stem cells from the bone marrow of hundreds of UK patients and inject them directly into hearts. </p> <p>Initial trials of the procedure carried out on more than 1,000 patients around the world suggest it could repair damaged muscle. </p> <p>But the trust needs to raise at least \u00a3300,000 to start its own trials, with \u00a36m needed in total to complete the four-year programme. </p> <p>The move comes after the recent publicity of the benefits of stem cell research , which the actor Christopher Reeve, who died this week, promoted. </p> <p>The UK trials will involve 600 patients and will aim to determine if the procedure is effective and should be made available in this country. </p> <p>The first phase will involve just 20 patients to pave the way for the second phase, bringing in 290 patients in a randomised controlled trial. </p> <p>Another 290 patients will then take part in the third phase to compare the treatment with other proven techniques. </p> <p>Dr Anthony Mathur, a consultant cardiologist at Barts and The London NHS Trust, said: \"This is a potentially revolutionary treatment for heart disease. </p> <p>\"It could transform the lives of people living with this debilitating condition. </p> <p>\"This trial will determine if this is a safe and effective procedure.\" </p> <p>It is estimated that 2.7 million people in the UK are living with coronary heart disease, many having to take a cocktail of drugs to control the condition. </p> <p>Once the trust has raised \u00a3300,000, it will start selecting patients to take part in the stem cells trial. </p> <p>The Heart Cells Foundation is being launched at a reception hosted by the Lord Mayor of the City of London, Alderman Robert Finch. </p> <p>More information about the appeal is available <a href=\"http://www.heartcellsfoundation.com\" target_new\">here</a> or from the appeal office at the trust on 020 7601 8873.</p>",
  "<p>The Athens Olympics smashed all previous TV viewing figures for the games with an unprecedented 4 billion people around the world tuning in, millions more than those who watched the Sydney games.</p> <p>Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, said that 3.9 billion people watched the Athens games, up from 3.6 million in Sydney, with viewing up dramatically in Asia, and significantly up in Europe and the US.</p> <p>Despite unfavourable time zones, Asia was the continent that registered the most significant increases in coverage and viewer hours for the games held between August 13 and 29.</p> <p>According to the IOC's new figures, China, which will host the 2008 games in Beijing, attracted an average audience of 85 million with a total of 9 billion viewer hours, each viewer watching, on average, eight hours of coverage. </p> <p>Japan doubled its TV coverage from Sydney, dedicating more than 700 hours to the Olympics, with each viewer watching 29 hours of coverage.</p> <p>Thanks to Athens' geographical position, viewing figures in Europe were up by 50% on the Sydney games in 2000, which left European sports fans contending with a significant time gap.</p> <p>According to the IOC, each and every European watched an average of 14 hours of the Athens games, amounting to 350 million viewer hours in 54 countries and 19 languages.</p> <p>And in the US, TV viewing also beat Sydney's figures, up by 14%, which will vindicate NBC's decision to shell out a whopping $793m (\u00a3444m) for the exclusive rights to broadcast the Athens competition. </p> <p>In the US, 203 million viewers watched at least some of the Athens Games, the most for any Olympics held outside the US.

  "President Bush's special envoy, James Baker, who has been trying to persuade the world to forgive Iraq's crushing debts, is simultaneously working for a commercial concern that is trying to recover money from Iraq, according to confidential documents. <p>Mr Baker's Carlyle Group is in a consortium secretly proposing to try to collect $27bn (\u00a315bn) on behalf of Kuwait, one of Iraq's biggest creditors, by using high-level political influence. It claims Mr Baker will not benefit personally, but the consortium could make millions in fees, retainers and commission as a result. </p> <p>Other countries, including Britain, have been urged by Mr Baker to relieve the new Iraq regime of its $200bn debt burden. Iraq owes Britain approximately $1bn. </p> <p>One international lawyer described the consortium's scheme as \"influence peddling of the crassest kind\". </p> <p>Jerome Levinson, an expert on political and corporate ethics at American University in Washington, told the Guardian: \"The consortium is saying to the Kuwaiti government, 'Through us you have the only chance to realize a substantial part of the debt. Why? Because of who we are and who we know'.\" </p> <p>When George Bush appointed Mr Baker, a former secretary of state, as his unpaid envoy on December 5 2003, he called Mr Baker's job \"a noble mission\". But Mr Baker is also a senior counsellor and an equity partner with a reported $180m stake in the merchant bank and defence contractor the Carlyle Group. </p> <p>A confidential 65-page Proposal to Assist the Government of Kuwait in Protecting and Realising Claims Against Iraq was sent in January from the consortium to Kuwait's foreign ministry, according to documents obtained by the Nation magazine in New York, which are published today on the Guardian website. </p> <p>In a letter dated August 6 2004, the consortium informs Kuwait's foreign ministry that the country's unpaid debts from Iraq \"are in imminent jeopardy\". </p> <p>World opinion is turning in favor of debt forgiveness, another letter warns, as evidenced by \"President Bush's appointment of former secretary of state James Baker as his envoy to negotiate Iraqi debt relief.\" </p> <p>The consortium's proposal spells out the threat: not only is Kuwait unlikely to see any of its $30bn from Iraq in sovereign debt, but the $27bn in war reparations that Iraq owes to Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion \"may well be a casualty of this US [debt relief] effort\". </p> <p>In the face of this threat, the consortium offers its services. Its roster of former high-level US and European politicians have \"personal rapport with the stakeholders in the anticipated negotiations\" and are able to \"reach key decision-makers in the UN and in key capitals\". </p> <p>Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University and a leading expert on government ethics and regulations, said this meant that Mr Baker was in a \"classic conflict of interest\". </p> <p>\"Baker is on two sides of this transaction: he is supposed to be representing the interests of the US, but he is also a senior counsellor at Carlyle, and Carlyle wants to get paid to help Kuwait recover its debts from Iraq.\" </p> <p>She added: \"Carlyle and the other companies are exploiting Baker's current position to try to land a deal with Kuwait that would undermine the interests of the US government.\" </p> <p>Last night, a Carlyle spokesman said the company had scaled down its involvement after the Baker appointment: \"Neither the Carlyle Group nor James Baker wrote, edited or authorised this proposal to the Kuwait government. When James Baker was named special envoy, which was before the proposal was produced and sent, Carlyle explicitly restricted its role to only investing assets on behalf of Kuwait, an activity that James Baker would play no role in nor benefit from.\" </p> <p>According to the documents, Carlyle is seeking to secure as part of the deal an extraordinary $1bn investment from the Kuwaiti government. </p> <p>The main proposal would transfer ownership of $57bn in unpaid Iraqi debts. The debts would be assigned to a foundation created and controlled by a consortium in which the key players are the Carlyle Group, the Albright Group (headed by another former secretary of state, Madeleine Albright) and several other well-connected firms. </p> <p>Under the deal, Kuwait would also give the consortium $2bn to invest in a private equity fund devised by the consortium, with half of that going to Carlyle. </p> <p>The consortium would then use its personal connections to persuade world leaders that Iraq must \"maximize\" its repa ration payments to Kuwait. The more the consortium gets Iraq to pay over a period, the more Kuwait collects, with the consortium taking a 5% commission or more. </p> <p>The goal of maximizing Iraq's debt payments directly contradicts the stated US foreign policy aim of drastically reducing Iraq's debt burden. </p> <p>Chris Ullman, Carlyle's spokesman in Washington, said that the firm was aware that a $1bn investment for Carlyle was part of the Kuwait proposal: \"We were aware of that. But we played no role in procuring that investment.\" </p> <p>\"So you were willing to take the billion but not to try to get it?\" He answered: \"Correct\" </p> <p>Mr Ullman said Mr Baker would not benefit from the proposed $1bn investment. \"We have controls in place that regulate how partners are compensated, we have a huge back office. We have the mechanisms.\" </p> <p>Asked whether the White House had been informed that the Carlyle consortium had been in negotiation with the government of Kuwait over debts at the time of the Baker appointment, he said: \"I'll get back to you on that.\" </p> <p>In the confidential documents, the consortium appears acutely aware of the sensitivity of Mr Baker's position as both Carlyle partner and also debt envoy for the US government. </p> <p>Immediately after listing all of the powerful players associated with Carlyle - including former President George Bush, former prime minister John Major and Mr Baker himself, the document states: \"The extent to which these individuals can play an instrumental role in fashioning strategies is now more limited due to the recent appointment of Secretary Baker as the president's envoy on international debt, and the need to avoid an apparent conflict of interest.\" </p> <p>Yet it goes on to state that this will soon change. </p> <p>\"We believe that with Secretary Baker's retirement from his temporary position [as debt envoy], Carlyle and those leading individuals associated with Carlyle will then once again be free to play a more decisive role.\" </p> <p>It was on January 21 2004, that Mr Baker's dual lives converged. That morning Mr Baker flew to Kuwait as Mr Bush's debt envoy. He met Kuwait's prime minister, its foreign minister and several other top officials with the stated goal of asking them to forgive Iraq's debts. </p> <p>Mr Baker's colleagues in the consortium chose that same day to hand-deliver their full proposal to the foreign minister, Mohammad Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah, the same man Mr Baker was meeting. </p> <p>A covering letter was signed by Ms Albright; David Huebner, chairman of the Coudert Brothers law firm (another consortium member); and Shahameen Sheikh, chair and CEO of International Strategy Group, a company created by the consortium for the purposes of this deal. </p> <p>Shahameen Sheikh, who made the delivery, said it was a coincidence. \"It had nothing to do with Mr Baker's visit ... I was in the region so I thought I would stop over on the way to Europe and deliver the proposal.\" </p> <p>The proposal \"takes into account the new dynamics that have developed in the region,\" states the Albright letter - dynamics that include \"Secretary Baker's negotiations\" on debt relief. </p> <p>If Kuwait accepts the consortium's offer, it states, \"we will distinguish Kuwait's claims - legally and morally - from the sovereign debt for which the United States is now seeking forgiveness.\" </p> <p>Iraq is the most heavily indebted country in the world. \"This debt endangers Iraq's long-term prospects for political health and economic prosperity,\" President Bush said when he appointed Mr Baker last December. </p> <p>At the time, critics expressed concern about whether Mr Baker was an appropriate choice. But the White House brushed them off. Mr Bush assured reporters: \"Jim Baker is a man of high integrity. We're fortunate he decided to take time out of what is an active life to step forward and serve America.\" </p> <p>Mr Ullman said at the time Mr Baker's post \"will have no impact on Carlyle whatsoever.\" </p> <p>The day before Mr Baker's appointment was announced, John Harris, managing director of the Carlyle Group, signed a statement to Alberto Gonzales, counsel to the president. It stated that Carlyle \"does not engage in lobbying or consulting\" and that \"Carlyle does not have any investment in Iraqi public or private debt.\" </p> <p>According to the documents, at the time of that statement the Carlyle consortium was at least five months into its assignment from the Kuwaiti government to \"prepare a detailed financial proposal for the protection and monetization\" of reparation debts from Iraq. </p> <p>The assignment was agreed at a high-level meeting with Kuwaiti officials in London on July 16 2003, according to the files the Guardian has obtained. </p> <p>Ms Clark said both criminal and regulatory statutes prohibited government officials from participating in government business in which they have a financial interest, including matters that affect an outside company that employs the official. </p> <p>In the statement to Judge Gonzales, Mr Harris wrote that \"Secretary Baker has renounced his partnership share of future benefits, if any, that might constitute a conflict with his official duties and he will not benefit personally through his Carlyle partnership income from his work as a special government employee.\" </p> <p>But the proposed deal with Kuwait is so large that it is hard to see how Mr Baker could be prevented from benefiting: Carlyle stands to land a $1bn investment, which is 10% of the firm's total equity funds. </p> <p>And under the proposal, the firm would be benefiting from that investment for at least 12 years. </p> <p>Ms Clark said: \"Even if Baker is somehow being screened from profiting from this deal, Carlyle is using Baker's government position to benefit themselves.\" </p> <p>She said it was time for the White House to come clean. \"There is a tremendous need for transparency here.\" </p> <p>According to Mr Levinson, \"What they are proposing is to completely undercut Baker's mission - and they are using their connection with Baker to Ahmed al-Fahad, under secretary to the prime minister of Kuwait, said this week: \"I have seen it [the proposal] and I am fully aware of the situation.\" </p> <p>But asked about Mr Baker's dual role, he said: \"It's hard to comment on that issue, especially now. I hope you fully understand.\" </p> <p><b>Copyright Naomi Klein.

  "<p>David Cregan's new play reveals a passionate concern with Iraq, global capitalism and environmental decay. But, while his social conscience does him credit, I wish he could have found a more plausible plot on which to hang his thoughts. </p> <p>The story hinges on the determination of country-bred, 91-year-old Toby to buy part of the vast, adjacent garden belonging to Gerald, a lecherous entrepreneur. For inexplicable reasons, Toby's family - including his dithering son, actressy daughter-in-law and ecologically concerned grandson - think the purchase will be the death of him and do everything in their power to stop it. Ariadne, the daughter-in-law, even offers to sleep with Gerald to stop the sale; although, since she is an anti-war marcher and he a rabid right-winger, it makes for a prickly liaison. </p> <p>Cregan's model is clearly Shaw's Heartbreak House: another country-garden play in which the leisured classes confront naked power in the shadow of global catastrophe. Unlike Shaw, Cregan lacks the courage of his convictions and refuses to acknowledge that he is writing a disquisitory piece. Significantly, the play takes off once he sacrifices plot to debate as in an angry clash between a trainee teacher and the exploitative Gerald, who smugly believes he can benefit himself and the south-east Asians by turning their shops into giant supermarkets. Cregan also has a sharp eye for individual eccentricity, as in his portrait of a xenophobic cook who caps her itemised catalogue of national loathing with: \"And then there's Sweden.\" </p> <p>Even if Joyce Branagh's production can't disguise the play's improbabilities, it looks verdantly elegant in Sam Dowson's design and matches this theatre's usual high acting standards. Miranda Foster as the sexually self-sacrificing Ariadne, Robert Benfield as her complaisant husband and Eve Shickle as the grumbling cook are all first rate. But while Cregan's play hinges on the quest for a plot of ground, I wish its political debates were grounded in a less whimsical plot. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until November 6.

  "Today is the first head-to-head clash between Tony Blair and Michael Howard since their party conference speeches, with Iraq back on the agenda in the wake of last week's Iraq Survey Group reporting no WMD in the country, and yesterday's admission from the foreign secretary that MI6 had privately withdrawn the pivotal 45-minute claim. <p>Charles Kennedy has already called on Mr Blair to make a full statement following PMQs - a call which appears to have gone unheeded. But for Mr Howard, whose party supported the war, the political geography is more complex. Party strategists in Bournemouth claimed Iraq was only 12th on most voters' list of concerns.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Blair is unlikely to expand on his \"I can apologise\" formulation on intelligence failures over Iraq made at his Brighton conference speech, while seeking to push the domestic agenda - such as today's good news on hospital A&amp;E waiting times. </p> <p><b>Midday</b><br> Sir Teddy Taylor is first - but Mr Blair begins by sending condolences to the families of Ken Bigley and two dead British soldiers.</p> <p>Sir Teddy asks if it is still government policy to seek euro entry, when would the referendum take place, and how long would a no vote govern the government.</p> <p>Mr Blair jokes that Sir Teddy used to be a \"lonely\" Tory in calling for EU withdrawal, but was now in the \"maintream\" of his party - \"rubbish\", jeer the Tory benches.</p> <p>Dover MP Gwyn Prosser bemoans the huge job losses announced by P&amp;O last week. \"We stand ready to make sure we'll give help to anyone made redundant,\" promises Mr Blair. </p> <p>Michael Howard's turn. \"I supported the war. It was the right thing to do. Will the prime minister realise before he moves on, there is one thing he must do: say sorry for misrepresenting the intelligence.\"</p> <p>\"I apologise for any information given in good faith that turned out to be wrong. Indeed, I have already done so,\" says Mr Blair, before saying four independent inquiries have vindicated him. \"He should stop playing politics on this issue and back our troops out in Iraq,\" he concludes.</p> <p>\"I didn't ask him to apologise for the war,\" points out Mr Howard, before adding that the Tories do back British troops. \"Why can't he bring himself to say sorry for misrepresenting the intelligence?\"</p> <p>\"I cannot say sorry because I do not believe I did,\" counters the prime minister, before bringing in yesterday's release of correspondence with Hans Blix which the British government released appearing to show the then chief UN weapons inspector thought the government's dossier could even \"underplay\" Saddam Hussein's capabilities.</p> <p>Mr Howard is not to be put off. He repeats that Mr Blair told parliament the intelligence was \"beyond doubt\" when in fact it was qualified. </p> <p>\"He maintained the desire but may not have had stockpiles,\" says Mr Blair, but goes on to say that \"everybody knows what [Michael Howard] is trying to do - capitalise on anti-war sentiment\".</p> <p>The prime minister concludes that Mr Howard has had four separate positions on the war - \"three too many for anyone who has serious aspirations to become prime minister.\"</p> <p>Anti-war Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn asks why Mr Blix wasn't given more time to conduct weapons inspections in Iraq. Mr Blair says the ISG found Saddam was in breach of UN resolutions, \"and that was the reason for going to war\".</p> <p><b>12.10pm</b><br> Mr Kennedy rises to ask why Sir David Manning, Mr Blair's foreign policy advisor, had told the Americans the prime minister \"would not budge\" from backing President Bush's desire for regime change.</p> <p>Mr Blair says the context of the memo was trying the UN route of backing resolutions rather than US regime change. </p> <p>\"Regime change is contrary to international law - where does that leave his war? He lead us into an illegal war,\" charges Mr Kennedy. </p> <p>The prime minister says we went to war because post-September 11 we could not allow a nation to remain in breach of UN resolutions on chemical and biological weapons. He asks if Mr Kennedy accepts the ISG report in full - before accusing him of only accepting conclusions he agreed with.</p> <p>\"Without our intervention Saddam and his sons would still be running Iraq and I stand by the decision I made,\" finishes Mr Blair.</p> <p><b>12.15pm</b><br> A question on internet safeguards defuses the atmosphere - briefly.</p> <p>Lib Dem Tom Brake reminds Mr Blair of his promise to resume attention on the Israel/Palestine problems \"in November\" - does the prime minister believe the people involved can wait that long, he asks?</p> <p>\"I will make it my personal priority but the reality is it's only after the election in the next few weeks we can make progress,\" says Mr Blair. </p> <p>Labour's Kelvin Hopkins says Spain's socialist government has had to bring back in-house privatised hospitals - will the prime minister thus abandon plans for foundation hopsitals?</p> <p>Mr Howard is back. Will Mr Blair join \"the consensus\" on pensions argued for by most pensioner groups, he asks.</p> <p>The prime minister reels of a list of Labour improvements and concessions for pensioners, but will not follow the new Tory policy of restoring the link between pensions and average earnings - a way of escaping means-testing, according to Mr Howard. </p> <p><b>12.20pm</b><br> \"It's time to stop talking and start taking action,\" says Mr Howard, echoing his party conference slogan. He says Adair Turner, the author of the recent pensions report, agrees with the Tories that means-testing discourages saving. </p> <p>The Conservatives did act in office, replies Mr Blair. They broke the link with earnings, and introduced VAT on fuel, and one in four pensioners lived in poverty. \"Forgive me if I ignore what he says based on 10 years as a cabinet minister in that government!\" </p> <p>Mr Howard responds by quoting Labour's Frank Field as saying that since 1997 Britain has gone from having one of the best pension provisions in Europe to one of the worst. </p> <p><b>12.25pm</b><br> Labour's Robert Wareing returns to the war, pointing out that Mr Blair has claimed that without the war Saddam and his sons would still be in power, while quoting the prime minister back at himself as saying: \"I detest his regime but even now he could save it by complying with UN demands.\"</p> <p>This produces great cheers and groans around the house - a dramatic moment - but Mr Blair says it complies exactly with his argument that the casus belli was Saddam's refusal to follow UN resolutions.</p> <p>The Speaker tells Plaid Cymru's Adam Price - who wants Mr Blair to be impeached - to \"calm down or leave the chamber.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Mr Blair, getting angry, quotes today's find of a mass grave in Iraq to show why such a regime should not have been allowed to gain WMD.</p> <p>The Tory Andrew Turner asks why \"nuclear sites in Iraq have now been looted\"? Mr Blair denies there wasn't a proper plan for post-Iraq reconstruction.</p> <p>Milton Keynes MP Phyllis Starkey quotes a local Tory in her constituency saying his party has suffered \"a collective failure of nerve\" over Europe. To Mr Blair's relief he can merely say this particular Tory is speaking \"a great deal of sense\".</p> <p>Iain Duncan Smith rises from the backbenches in PMQs - for the first time since he left the Tory leadership - to say that vulnerable should not be starved to death if they can't help themselves, as one provision of the mental incapacity bill may mean, and that MPs should have a free vote on the issue. </p> <p>Mr Blair says he will look at it closely, but the relevant minister disagrees with that interpretation of the bill. </p> <p>And that's the end of a fractious session.</p>",

  "<p>A ban on junk food advertising before 9pm is one of the proposals being considered by the government under stringent plans to fight child obesity, according to reports today.</p> <p>And all food advertising could carry a \"traffic light\" symbol warning of its sugar, salt and fat content.</p> <p>Some ministers believe a ban on junk food advertising before the 9 o' clock watershed is required if it is to succeed in the fight to reduce the amount of unhealthy food eaten by children.</p> <p>The proposals, outlined in the Times today, will prompt a showdown between the government and food and advertising companies, who are certain to oppose the measures.</p> <p>It is unlikely, however, that ministers will introduce a total ban on junk food adverts before 9pm.

  "Radical proposals to increase the number of female and ethnic minority judges were unveiled by the government today. <p>Judges could go back into private practice as lawyers, or take career breaks, under the shakeup put forward by the lord chancellor in a bid to end the elderly male domination of the profession.</p> <p>At present only 15.8% of court judges are women and 3.4% are from minority ethnic groups. Lord Falconer said this morning: \"We have judges of high quality but they do not adequately reflect society,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>\"The aim here is to improve the diversity of the judges: more women judges, more judges from black and ethnic minority groups, more disabled judges as well. </p> <p>\"We want the judges to reflect society. The process by which appointments occur is not helpful to making sure there is this diversity.\" </p> <p>Lord Falconer's Department of Constitutional Affairs today launches a consultation paper called \"increasing diversity in the judiciary\" - which also raises the prospect of more flexible sitting arrangements for courts. </p> <p>The time a lawyer must be qualified for before being eligible for a judicial post, currently seven to 10 years, could also be reduced under the plans. </p> <p>At present, judges are not allowed to return to professional practice once they have joined the full-time bench. </p> <p>But today's consultation paper puts forward the idea to boost the number of female, black and Asian judges. </p> <p>Lord Falconer stressed that appointments would continue to be made on merit. </p> <p> The document will also suggest changes to age limits; the involvement of independent lay members in sifting and interviewing for office; part-time sitting for judges below high court level; and the publication of an annual judicial appointments report. </p> <p>\"It also raises the question of whether it should be possible for full-time judges to return to professional practice, and reviews whether it should be necessary for judges to have sat part-time before they can be considered for a full-time appointment,\" a spokeswoman for the Department for Constitutional Affairs said.</p> <p>About half of new barristers and solicitors are women but as few as one in six of these progress to the judiciary. One in four law students are from ethnic minorities yet there are no judges from these groups in the high courts. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the prime minister's wife, Cherie Booth QC, also called for more women to enter the judiciary. </p> <p>At a lecture at Durham University in February, she called the lack of senior women lawyers \"alarming\" and said the law should not be the preserve of \"middle class white men\". </p> <p>The paper cites Canada as a progressive example, where around a quarter of judges are women thanks to a proactive recruitment policy. Responses to the consultation paper are due to be published next spring.</p>",

  "<p>This is the third in our series of interviews spinning out of last week's article on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/online/story/0,3605,1320832,00.html\">anonymous workplace bloggers</a>. It follows interviews we have already published with <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/online/archives/weblogging/2004/10/whats_in_a_name.html\">Call Centre Confidential</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/online/archives/weblogging/2004/10/anonymous_blogging_interviews_part_ii.html\">Doing Less Harm</a>.</p> <p>\"Mr Teacher\" writes an anonymous weblog called <a href=\"http://thereportcard.blogspot.com\">The Report Card</a>.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> When did you start your blog and why? Were other blogs, in particular other job/workplace blogs, an inspiration?</p> <p><strong>Mr Teacher:</strong> The Report Card was born on November 3, 2003. Many months before that, a friend had told me she was going to start a blog. I had no idea what blogs were about, so I started reading hers from time to time. That led me to a job-related blog that I could identify with, having worked in that industry in the past. On November 3, I was very frustrated and decided to start my blog to relieve some stress. There will be more detail on my Blogday (the anniversary of the birthday of my blog) this year.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> What were you initially hoping to achieve with the blog? Has your blog (and what you write on it) changed as it's gone on?</p> <p><strong>MrT:</strong> Initially, I just wanted a place to vent. That was all. However in May I set up a poll for my regular readers to vote whether they wanted me to continue to post only about work related things, add other things to it or set up a different page for other things. The majority of those who voted wanted me to add other things also.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> What's reaction to it been like so far? Which kinds of entries are the most popular/draw the most comment?</p> <p><strong>MrT:</strong> So far, the reaction has been positive. Face it, we all have problems where we work, so I think that people like reading about others' problems and can relate to them. It's hard to say what the most popular posts are about, but I'd have to say that they're posts that involve blatant stupidity.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> You blog anonymously \u2013 if you blogged under your real name, how would your blog be different?</p> <p><strong>MrT:</strong> I also have a blog under my real name, and it's quite different. It's for my family and closest friends and has completely different posts than The Report Card. It mainly contains observations, thoughts, etc.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Does anyone from your work read your blog? If so, has anyone guessed that you're behind the blog?</p> <p><strong>MrT:</strong> No one from work that I know of reads my blog. Most of my colleagues aren't computer savvy, so I'm not too worried about it. However, if any of my colleagues found it, they'd instantly be able to place names to the pseudonyms.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Do you see your blog as a purely personal thing \u2013 a way of dealing with the everyday frustrations at work \u2013 or does it have a more general, possibly political purpose \u2013 a kind of low-level whistle-blowing function \u2013 letting people know the reality of certain modern jobs?</p> <p><strong>MrT:</strong> My blog is definitely a personal thing. It's how I vent the frustration that work causes me. It does let people know about the reality of my job, but certainly is not political.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Some people have suggested workplace blogs are a kind of rebellion against modern 'overwork' culture (in which people work longer and longer hours, in which work is seen as some sort of defining moral value, in which workers are under more and more surveillance and control, via audits, reviews etc). Do you agree?</p> <p><strong>MrT:</strong> Not really. I think that most workplace blogs are set up for people to say the things they would like to say at work, but choose not to (which is probably a good decision). They also want others to know that they're not alone. Everyone puts up with heaps of stupidity at work.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Why do you think people read your blog? To find out 'the inside truth' about a particular area of modern life?</p> <p><strong>MrT:</strong> Yes, people probably read my blog to see an insider's view. Students and parents alike are probably curious to see what goes on behind the scenes at a school. What teachers have to deal with other than students. My blog gives them that opportunity.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Is what you write on your blog 'the truth' about your job? Or do you sometimes find yourself embellishing slightly, to make the blog more interesting. Bloggers often say that, though they set out to write about the everyday reality of their lives, they find that they've created a kind of alternate persona, which both is them and isn't, at the same time. Perhaps another way of coming at this is to say that blogs can be like stories and, as you build up momentum/audience, is there a temptation to spice things up slightly to keep people hooked?</p> <p><strong>MrT:</strong> My blog is the truth. It's not embellished at all. If something happens at work, I try to find a quiet place (usually the toilet) to write it down, including exact quotes.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Why are anonymous job blogs so popular now? Does it say something about modern work? Or does it say something about blogs and what people think they're best at (eg personal accounts that take you inside a previously hidden world/correct big media assumptions etc)?</p> <p><strong>MrT:</strong> In my opinion, the media only care about sensational things that will improve their rating. Blogs like mine are personal accounts that from people who have nothing to gain, which is what I think the public want nowadays.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> What do you hope to achieve with your blog? A way out of your current job? A publishing deal?</p> <p><strong>MrT:</strong> My blog is only for fun. It really has no purposes other than for me to vent and also let people know what goes on behind the scenes of a school. I'm a realist and realise that it won't get me out of my, nor will it get me a publishing deal (but I wouldn't complain if it did).</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Is doing your blog still fun? Do you foresee a time when it might feel like another (unpaid) job? If that happened, what would you do?</p> <p><strong>MrT:</strong> Yes, The Report Card is still fun to do. I'll continue it until it is no longer fun, whenever that may be. If I change schools (I'll never leave the teaching profession), The Report Card will continue - idiocy can be found at most workplaces.</p> <p><strong>O:</strong> Do you feel a sense of responsibility to your readers? By which I mean I think a lot of people read job/workplace blogs and trust that they're telling it like it is about a particular job... Which is another way of saying, do you see yourself as a kind of journalist, with certain responsibilities as a result, or does the blog only have to please you/work for you?</p> <p><strong>MrT:</strong> Yes, I feel a sense of responsibility to my readers, which is why it important to me that my blog is 100% truthful. It wouldn't be fair to my readers if I made something up to get more readers. I don't consider myself as a kind of a journalist, however, I do have a certain level of integrity I like to maintain both online and offline.</p> <p>By the way, it'd also be good if you could mention the <a href=\"http://anonworkblogs.blogspot.com\">Anonymous Work Blogs Blogring</a> and, somehow, (subtly) encourage people to start anonymous work blogs and join the ring.</p> <p><em>Interview by Jim McClellan</em></p>",
  "Pro-hunting peers are planning to table a series of amendments to the hunting bill after it passed its second reading in the House of Lords last night. <p>They are seeking to strike out the demand for a total ban on foxhunting from the bill, which was inserted by a House of Commons amendment, and replace it with a call to license hunting, based on the government's original proposals.</p> <p>Conservative peer Lord Mancroft, who is moving the amendments with Labour, the Liberal Democrats and cross-bench colleagues, denied that their amendments represented an attempt to defy the Commons.</p> <p>\"We are planning to do what the prime minister suggested; come up with a sensible workable compromise and give the government back the bill it originally tabled,\" he told Guardian Unlimited.</p> <p>\"We have compromised, and compromised, and compromised, and we are prepared to do so again.\"</p> <p>Lord Mancroft's amendments would restate the government's original plan to allow registers to licence hunts by judging whether they pass two tests: do they cause \"least suffering\" to foxes and have the \"utility\" of limiting the fox population. </p> <p>His comments come after environment minister Lord Whitty warned peers that they were \"in the last chance saloon\" over the bitterly contested issue during last night's eight hour debate.</p> <p>He urged the upper chamber to seek an alternative to confrontation with the House of Commons, and stressed that MPs had voted overwhelmingly to ban foxhunting, stag hunting and hare coursing.</p> <p>Ministers have threatened to use the Parliament Act, which has only been used three times since 1949, to force the bill on to the statute book if the Lords blocks it.</p> <p>Lord Whitty told the Lords: \"I want to ask all peers to take proper note of the very clearly expressed views of the House of Commons.\"</p> <p>He warned: \"We are now in the last chance saloon. The ball is in the court of this House, of those who have supported hunting in its present form, to offer a way forward or alternatively to accept the bill as it now stands if we are not to provoke the use of the Parliament Act.\"</p> <p>Labour peer, Baroness Mallalieu, who is president of the Countryside Alliance and one of the co-authors of the pro-hunting amendment with Lord Mancroft, warned that if a ban became law \"respect for parliament, for its ability to protect the freedom of minorities and respect for the due process of law will break down in a number of parts of the country\".</p> <p>She said: \"I hope that this house will work constructively in the proper time so that we can return a bill to the Commons this session which will be based on a framework which the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael, felt was right, a regulatory bill.\"</p> <p>It should apply \"to all forms of hunting. If they fail the tests they won't get a licence, if they pass them, then they should\".</p> <p>In the Commons, there is a large majority in favour of an outright ban. Led by former ministers Tony Banks and Sir Gerald Kaufman, they argue that hunting is cruel.</p> <p>The hunting row brought a split between MPs and peers last year after Mr Banks amended the original licensing bill to an outright ban.</p> <p>This was later overturned by peers to restore fox and stag hunting and hare coursing. The bill failed when it ran out of time.</p>",
  "<p>We had to drive along the Nine Dragon River for two days to reach the home, farm and darkroom of Li Tianbing, the 70-year-old peasant who has become one of China's hottest photographers. According to our driver, it is the worst road in China. Early on, the tarmac runs out, and you have to bump along rutted tracks of soggy red earth through banana plantations, then climb for hours up spectacular winding roads before finally reaching the small hamlet of Makeng, a cluster of traditional two-storey courtyard houses teeming with animals. In the background are verdant forests and terraced rice paddies, where farmers use oxen to till the earth. </p> <p>Makeng's inaccessibility is a large part of the reason for the sudden celebrity of Li, the village cameraman whose \"natural light\" technique - which involves exposing film by opening and closing his bedroom door - has remained unchanged for more than 50 years. </p> <p>For Li, it is a hobby and a job, rather than art. But his evocative images of a China that was thought to have passed without visual record have upstaged some of the most provocative installations and performances of the country's growing avant-garde movement. </p> <p>Li - whose work is on display at the Shanghai Biennale - is one of a handful of craftsmen \"discovered\" in the Long March Art Project, an ambitious attempt to break contemporary art out of its secluded urban shell and take it into the countryside, where the vast mass of China's 1.3 billion people live. Since the project began last year, more than 200 contemporary artists have amused and bemused peasant audiences with impromptu performances, political lectures and screenings of Jean-Luc Godard's 1967 film, La Chinoise, which explores the Maoist posturings of late-1960s French youth. Their attempts to provoke and confront have often been intriguing, but somehow even the work of the biggest risk-takers - such as Qin Ga, who had the route of the original Long March tattooed across his back - seem familiar compared with the surprises evoked by the peasant craftsman encountered along the way. </p> <p>Take the hill carving of Jiang Jiwei. For more than 40 years, this ascetic, who lives from donations by awe-struck visitors, has been reshaping the landscape by cutting reliefs of communist leaders, manifestos and state edicts into a hillside in Quanzhou, Guanxi province. The results are a higgledy-piggledy juxtaposition of Mao deities next to a stone tablet bearing the full text of a government white paper on birth control, as well as busts of minor provincial officials placed beside Marx's communist manifesto. </p> <p>Another surprise hit has been Wang Wenhai, a former propaganda sculptor whose work has changed dramatically since he was enlisted on the Long March. For decades, Wang worked for the Yan'an communist party gift shop, churning out thousands of classically heroic Mao figurines. Last year, after spending a few weeks in Factory 798 - the contemporary art hothouse in Beijing - Wang's art was transformed. Suddenly, the craftsman became a modern artist, producing abstract Maos, faceless Maos, Buddha Maos, gay Maos and a giant 4m-high Mr and Mrs Mao. </p> <p>But Li's photography has had the biggest impact on the public consciousness, perhaps because his collection represents not only a body of art, but a historical record. </p> <p>In 1946, Li - then 12 years old - took a risk that would transform his life. He had been hired as a porter for a British-Chinese cameraman who had been sent to Fujian province to take portraits of local peasants for the identity cards being introduced by the Kuomintang authorities. For a year he lugged the heavy Thornton-Pickard triple extension imperial camera through paddy fields and bamboo forests in one of the most remote corners of China. </p> <p>He and his boss drew incredulous crowds everywhere they went. Most villagers had never even seen a photograph before, let alone had their picture taken. The boy who helped change the film, print the pictures, and show the results to the excited subjects had discovered his vocation. </p> <p>So when the foreigner packed up his equipment for the last time, Li embarked on a wild scheme of which only a 12-year-old boy could dream. Although his family was poor and sometimes short of food, he stole his grandmother's cow, led it for four days to the town where the photographer was staying and sold it for 600 renminbi (about \u00a340 today). He persuaded the foreigner to part with his camera and returned home, vowing to make up for the loss of the cow with the money he would earn from his new vocation: village photographer. </p> <p>Recalling that day to the first British man he has seen since, Li grins, deepening the wrinkles on his weather-beaten face. \"My mother was furious when she saw what I had got in return for the cow. To try to win her over, I offered to take her portrait. But she wasn't having any of it.\" </p> <p>Ever since, Li has been making a unique record of peasant life in one of the poorest parts of the world. Li estimates he has carried his Thorton-Packard 220,000km on his wanderings around 400 villages, some of which take more than a week to reach on foot. Simply going to the nearest town to buy film and processing materials meant a four-day, 200km walk along mountain paths. And walking alone through this still wild part of China can be risky. Li's close escapes from wolves, snakes and tigers have become the stuff of family legend. But political persecution caused the greatest suffering. </p> <p>In 1974, towards the end of the cultural revolution, Li was labelled a \"capitalist roader\" for using British-made equipment to earn a private income. He was driven out of town and his family forced to disown him. His wife and children were denied rice rations. According to Li's son Jincheng, they survived by eating grass. He said his mother was so poor she had to sell one of her children. </p> <p>Tales of craftsmen suffering for their art do not come much more harrowing. Some - such as the story of Li leaping through a window with his camera to escape a fire set by bandits, or the one of him holding the equipment above his head as flood waters closed in - appear to have been embellished or mistranslated over frequent tellings. However, it is not the veracity of the yarns but the quantity and quality of the photographs that make Li remarkable. </p> <p>Li estimates he has taken 300,000 pictures of village weddings, communist party meetings and spring festival family gatherings using the most natural facilities. Until last year, Makeng had no electricity; the only running water comes from a stream. And Li still relies on techniques he was taught at 12. He removes the film under a blanket in his darkened bedroom and exposes it by opening the door for a few seconds. Developing the prints, he works with chopsticks by the light of a candle inside a red paper lantern. For enlargement, he shortens the height of a pipe from the ceiling that lets in an adjustable circle of light. \"It doesn't get much more basic,\" says Li. \"But you have to take account of the weather, which can be tricky. On a sunny day, you only need to open the door for one or two seconds to expose the film. But you need a bit longer when the clouds roll in.\" </p> <p>Given this method, the results are impressively clear, if not always uniform. Even the slight over- or underexposure - as well as the occasional tint of colour added to the monochrome images - adds a distinct pre-industrial flavour to the collection at the Shanghai Biennale. </p> <p>That Li's photography has travelled better than many installations of the increasingly jet-setting generation of contemporary artists, has raised awkward questions for the Long March Art Campaign's organisers. But Li says there is no comparison: \"What they do is so different. It's a good way for them to express their thoughts, but it's not for me,\" he says. \"I just love pictures. I always have. In all these years I have never - even for one single moment - regretted stealing that cow.\"</p>",
  "It's just possible that you have heard this once or twice before recently, but the forthcoming American election, on November 2, may be the most important in living memory. People have been saying this about every presidential race for decades - but, as one environmentalist put it recently in a US newspaper interview, precisely the problem with crying wolf is that sometimes there is a wolf. You would be forgiven, though, for feeling increasingly helpless as you hear the \"most important election\" mantra repeated daily: unless you happen to be a voter in a handful of swing states, there's little you can do about the final result. If you're not American, the situation is more acute. Certainly, the actions of the US impact on our lives in overwhelming ways; British political life may now be at least as heavily influenced by White House policy as by the choices of UK voters. And yet, though the US Declaration of Independence speaks of \"a decent respect to the opinions of mankind\", you don't, of course, have a vote. You can't even donate money to the campaigns: foreign contributions are outlawed. And you're unlikely to have the chance to do any campaigning on the ground. All you can do is wait and watch: you're powerless. <p>Or are you? At G2, that sounded like fighting talk. Where others might see delusions of grandeur, we saw an opportunity for public service - and so, on the following pages, we have assembled a handy set of tools that non-Americans can use to have a real chance of influencing the outcome of the vote. We've identified ways to give money to help your preferred candidate, even though direct campaign contributions from foreigners aren't allowed. There are ideas for making your voice heard in the influential local media outlets where it could really count. And at the core of it is a unique scheme to match individual Guardian readers to individual American voters, giving you the opportunity to write a personal letter, citizen to citizen, explaining why this election matters to you, and which issues you think ought to matter to the US electorate. It may even be a chance to persuade somebody to use their vote at all. </p> <p>To maximise the likelihood of your efforts making a difference, we've zeroed in on one of the places where this year's election truly will be decided: Clark County, Ohio, which is balanced on a razor's edge between Republicans and Democrats. In the 2000 election, Al Gore won Clark County by 1% - equivalent to 324 votes - but George Bush won the state as a whole by just four percentage points. This time round, Ohio is one of the most crucial swing states: Kerry and Bush have been campaigning there tire lessly - they've visited Clark County itself - and the most recent Ohio poll shows, once again, a 1% difference between the two of them. The voters we will target in our letter-writing initiative are all Clark County residents, and they are all registered independents, which somewhat increases the chances of their being persuadable. </p> <p>Several of the ideas described here can easily be applied across the US too, though, and we have provided further resources on our website for this purpose. While there's no point being coy about Britain's preferences in this election (never mind those of Guardain readers) - a poll last month put backing for Kerry at 47%, against 16% for Bush - we have included information for supporters of both main candidates. </p> <p>It's worth considering at the outset how counterproductive this might all be, especially if approached undiplomatically. Anybody might be justifiably angered by the idea of a foreigner trying to interfere in their democratic process. But this year the issue is more charged than ever: the Bush/Cheney campaign has made a point of portraying Kerry as overly concerned about what other nations think, and the Democrat's ambiguous debate point about American foreign policy decisions needing to pass a \"global test\" has become one of the president's key lines of attack. \"People don't necessarily want to hear what people from other countries have to say,\" says Rachelle Valladares, the London-based chair of Democrats Abroad. \"If you contact someone you know personally in the States, and urge them to vote, it would probably carry twice the weight.\" Michael Dorf, a Columbia university law professor who has studied foreign influences on US elections, points out that it would not be to either candidate's advantage \"to be seen as the candidate of the foreigners. Part of it's just xenophobia, but there is also a sense that, you know, this is our election: you vote for your parliament and prime minister, we vote for our president and Congress.\" </p> <p>On the other hand, being from Britain ought to give you a certain leverage: in stump speeches and debates, Bush has repeatedly praised Tony Blair's cooperation over Iraq, making America's long-treasured alliance with the UK key to the president's defence of his foreign policy. Kerry, too, knows that he's speaking to a resilient strand of opinion when he emphasises the need for strong international alliances: a better coalition in Iraq, he constantly reiterates, might have saved US lives. (One recent poll suggested that 43% of Americans think that declining world respect for their nation is a \"major problem\".) As a British citizen, you can certainly wield some influence, but you could seriously alienate people too. </p> <p><b> Write to a voter</b><br> </p> <p>The most powerful transatlantic connection is a personal one, so we have designed a system to match individual Guardian readers with individual voters in Clark County, in the crucial swing state of Ohio. To join in, visit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/clarkcounty\">www.theguardian.com/clarkcounty</a> and enter your email address. You'll receive, by email, the name and postal address of a Clark County voter. We have included only those voters who chose to list themselves as unaffiliated, instead of as Republican or Democrat: that is no guarantee that they are persuadable, of course, but it does increase the chances. The data on which our system is based is publicly available, but we have designed it to give out each address only once, so there is no danger of recipients getting deluged. </p> <p>In formulating your letter, you will need to introduce yourself: no individual Clark County voter will have any reason to be expecting your communication. And in choosing your arguments, keep in mind the real risk of alienating your reader by coming across as interfering or offensive. You might want to handwrite your letter, for additional impact, and we strongly recommend including your own name and address - it lends far more credibility to your views, and you might get a reply. </p> <p>Finally, post your letter soon. Letters sent by regular airmail from the UK to the US usually take five days to reach their recipient, and there is little time to waste. Postage costs 43p for a postcard, 47p for a letter weighing 10g or less, and 68p for a letter weighing up to 20g. You don't have to visit a post office, but Royal Mail recommends writing \"Par Avion - By Airmail\" on the front of the envelope, and your return address on the back. </p> <p><b> Give money</b><br> </p> <p>American law forbids foreigners from giving money to affect the outcome of a federal election - except that, on closer inspection, it doesn't. You're banned from donating to the campaigns themselves, or to many of the independent campaigning groups that fight explicitly on behalf of one candidate. So you need to identify officially non-partisan groups whose activities, none the less, have the practical effect of helping one candidate over the other. \"Perhaps the most important way foreigners could help John Kerry would be to help out those organisations which have, as part of their mission, fostering African-American voter turnout,\" says Nathaniel Persily, a Pennsylvania university expert on election law. \"It's quite clear that if there was 100% African-American turnout in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, John Kerry would win this election running away.\" The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is the most obvious choice here - an influential, well-organised, non-partisan body whose get-out-the-vote activities are extremely likely to end up helping the Democrats. </p> <p>\"On the Republican side, it would be the Christian conservatives,\" Persily adds. \"[Bush adviser] Karl Rove has tried to register four million additional Christian evangelicals, and if they all turn out, then Bush wins.\" The leading option here would be the Christian Coalition, which describes itself as \"America's leading grassroots organisation defending our Godly heritage\". As for more overtly partisan organisations, we don't recommend trying to donate - but it's worth pointing out that much of the law banning foreign contributions has never been tested in court and, argues Michael Dorf at Columbia, may even be unconstitutional on grounds of free speech. \"If a group calling itself Europeans for Truth wants to run ads giving their view of the truth,\" Dorf says, \"it's hard to draw a principled distinction between that and a British newspaper available at a US newsstand that has an editorial calling Bush and Blair liars.\" </p> <p><b>Visit the NAACP website:</b> <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org\">http://www.naacp.org</a> <br> <b>Give to the NAACP:</b> <a href=\"https://www.naacp.org/contribute.php\">https://www.naacp.org/contribute.php</a> or fax a credit-card donation to 001 410 580 5623.<br> <b>Give to the NAACP in Ohio:</b><br> Send a money order marked \"donation\" to NAACP, 233 South High Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215 USA.

  "More than 60 million viewers saw the first presidential debate; the second also drew a mammoth audience, up 50% on the debates of 2000. But this election's most intense political communication has bypassed the vast majority of the American public. <p>The Bush and Kerry campaigns, together with their surrogates, have aired more than 600,000 TV ads since the end of primary season in March. But most of those have been aimed at a narrow slice of America, in swing states. As we enter the final phase of this presidential race that slice is getting narrower, though the money spent on advertising keeps soaring.</p> <p>When the dust settles on November 3 about $1bn (\u00a30.6bn) will have been spent on campaign ads, making this election easily the most expensive in history - yet over 60% of all Americans will not have seen a single political commercial.</p> <p>Eight of the top 10 cities where the most advertising dollars are being spent are in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. Topping the list is Cleveland, Ohio. Christmas has come early for local TV stations in the capital of America's industrial rust belt. </p> <p>Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania, ranks second: $25m will be spent in this city, two hours away from New York. So while New Yorkers have been spared the advertising avalanche, the good burghers of Pennsylvania and South Jersey have been bombarded with the candidates' messages for months.</p> <p>In third place is Miami, Florida, as balanced on a knife edge today as it was four years ago. To gauge how this election is playing out you need to keep up with the campaign ads running in these three battleground states. </p> <p>Bush is running three new ads in tight rotation. The most commonly repeated of these attempts to condemn Kerry as the poster child of tax-and-spend liberalism. The narrator intones: \"John Kerry and the liberals in Congress's record on the economy: higher taxes 350 times ... an average of once every three weeks for 20 years ... like clockwork.\" </p> <p>This ad is the reason John Kerry kept warning viewers in the second debate not to pay heed to the labels Bush is trying to stick on him: his warning was not aimed at the debate viewers so much as at the few thousand people who could tip the election in those key swing states, who have been inundated with Bush advertising.</p> <p>The most recent ad, released after the second debate, attempts to win back ground Bush has lost to Kerry on Iraq. Kerry has successfully killed the \"flip-flop\" argument against him and turned the attention on to Bush's record. </p> <p>The Bush advert tries to paint Kerry as soft on terrorism. \"Kerry said defeating terrorism was really more about law enforcement and intelligence than a strong military operation,\" declares the voiceover, using Kerry's comments from the second debate against him. \"How can Kerry protect us when he doesn't understand the threat?\"</p> <p>Bush is again trying to pin a \"shopsoiled liberal\" label on Kerry. The ad lacks power, however, because viewers immediately connect the phrase \"strong military operation\" with Iraq and the negative images of mayhem they see on the TV news. </p> <p>The third ad in heavy circulation tries to tarnish Kerry with the \"trial lawyer\" reputation of his running mate, John Edwards, arguing that the healthcare crisis is a result of nuisance lawsuits. This advert is the weakest of the three because most people rightly lay the blame of their sky-high premiums at the door of the healthcare management companies, part of the big-business monolith they feel gets deferential treatment from the current administration. </p> <p>The fundamental problem with these Bush ads is that they try to attach current problems to a hypothetical future performance. Kerry's 20-year record in the Senate only gives the president so much ammunition; once we get to the last four years, Bush has to take responsibility for his own record - and he is on shaky ground. However much he would like to blame Kerry for it, it's a tough, if not impossible, sell.</p> <p>Kerry's latest ads work better because they focus on the president's actual performance, or lack of it, in three key areas: homeland security, jobs and social issues.</p> <p>The newest clearly points out what has not happened in George Bush's war on terror. It states that 95% of all containers coming into America go uninspected, and that this president would prefer to protect his tax cut for the rich before the nation's security. </p> <p>The president's dismal economic performance provides the fuel for another ad. \"Only Herbert Hoover had a worse record on jobs,\" concludes the announcer. The bald, irrefutable fact of the first net decrease in jobs in 70 years speaks for itself.</p> <p>A third ad draws on the star power of the extremely popular and Parkinson's-afflicted Michael J Fox. Talking straight to camera, Fox questions Bush's decision - informed by the religious right - to limit stem cell research. \"George Bush says we can wait,\" states Fox calmly. \"I say lives are at stake and it's time for leadership.\"</p> <p>While the final presidential debate is likely to draw a huge TV audience, it will not be these voters who decide the outcome: that honour will fall to a bleary-eyed, ad-addled few. The rest of us can only hope they get it right.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> James is a former senior Democratic party strategist</p>",
  "<p>All new NHS staff in England will be required to undergo a criminal record check in a bid to improve patient safety, under government measures announced today. </p> <p>The checks will become mandatory from early next year for all new employees with access to patients as part of their normal duties, said health minister John Hutton. This includes doctors, nurses, cleaners and maintenance staff.</p> <p>The current policy on checking new staff varies between different NHS employers. Only staff who work with children are legally obliged to undergo police checks. </p> <p>The Department of Health said that the checks for NHS staff would trawl information held on the police national computer and the records held by the Department for Education and Skills to help NHS employers assess the suitability of candidates. </p> <p>There will also be enhanced checks for the most sensitive posts, which will also assess relevant information held by local police forces.</p> <p>Mr Hutton said: \"We want to do all we can to ensure the safety of patients receiving treatment on the NHS. Checks on the criminal records of new recruits will help us achieve this aim. The security of patients must be our top priority.</p> <p>\"The results of the checks will help NHS employers make safer recruitment decisions, and give the public extra piece of mind.\"</p> <p>The checks will be conducted by the Criminal Records Bureau, which was heavily criticised after hundreds of pupils had the start of their school term put back in September 2002 because of delays in vetting teachers.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the government announced that people who had abused vulnerable adults such as older people or people with mental health problems would be banned from ever working in a caring role. </p> <p>The Protection of Vulnerable Adults (Pova) initiative operates in a similar way to police checks already carried out on those wishing to work with children. Under the scheme care providers in England and Wales have a statutory duty to check whether a potential employee is on the Pova list before allowing them to start work.</p>",
  "<p>The England and Wales Cricket Board this morning named David Collier as their new chief executive. </p> <p>Chairman David Morgan unveiled Tim Lamb's successor at a press conference at Lord's. </p> <p>Collier has held the same position at Nottinghamshire and is already a member of the ECB management board. </p> <p>The 48-year-old has experience of working in sports marketing and the leisure industry as well as in cricket administration with four counties. </p> <p>He has been assistant secretary at Essex, secretary at Gloucestershire and chief executive at Leicestershire. He has spent the last four years at Trent Bridge. </p> <p>As a former international hockey umpire, he also had recent success in creating a rescue package as financial adviser and vice-president to the English Hockey Association. </p> <p>Lamb, who held the post for six years, completed his period in office earlier this month after initially announcing his resignation in May.</p> <p>Collier said: \"I am delighted to have been offered the opportunity to lead the ECB at such an exciting point in the game's history. </p> <p>\"During the past year the success of the England team, the increasing crowds at Twenty20 cricket, the development of young cricket to the Academy system at both county and national level and the expansion of cricket being played at club and school level demonstrates that there are solid foundations for the future of cricket in England and Wales.\"</p> <p>ECB chairman David Morgan revealed Collier's \"business background\" had helped him land the job. </p> <p>\"We were looking for someone with a strong business background coupled with a knowledge and love of cricket,\" he said. \"David has both qualities. </p> <p>\"He has successfully led Nottinghamshire for the past five years and also has significant business experience both within and outside of cricket.\" </p> <p>Collier described developing the strategic plan for the future of cricket in England and Wales as \"one of (his) first tasks\". </p> <p>He will particularly focus on the development of young players from grassroots to county and international standard and said the numbers of overseas players in the English game will be looked at. </p> <p>\"I'm a passionate believer that a successful England team is our greatest asset,\" said Collier. \"Some \u00a39m has gone into community clubs already and county clubs are starting to reap the benefits of investment over the years. </p> <p>\"We do have to focus on youngsters and make sure that they are coming through. Going on from school cricket to club cricket is essential if they are to develop into county players. </p> <p>\"It is important that as many young players as possible have the opportunity to benefit from centres of excellence and the best coaching available,\" he said. </p> <p>But Collier also maintains that foreign players have been good for the domestic game. </p> <p>\"A lot of unqualified (for England) players have helped us raise the standard of the game so that is a delicate balancing act. We also have to operate within the law, EC law, so we are hamstrung by one or two guidelines,\" he said. </p> <p>The new chief executive will not become embroiled in the current controversy over the England team's tour to Zimbabwe as he will not take up his position until later in the year. </p> <p>\"Other people will be dealing with it. Hugh Morris is acting chief executive and I'm sure he will steer the ship the right way,\" added Collier.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: Straw withdraws 45-minute claim, critics round on Beckham, pumpkin thefts worry farmers.</p> <p> <b>ADDRESSING THE PENSIONS PROBLEM</b><br> </p> <p>The message is bleak: Britain has been living in a \"fool's paradise\" and we must work longer, save more or pay more tax or else face an impoverished old age.</p> <p>Adair Turner's forceful report on the looming pensions crisis generates acres of comment and analysis, despite its dry subject matter. The Telegraph's leader warns us that \"it would be tempting to dismiss the 500-page first report of the Pensions Commission as boring, even by the standards of the subject, but that would be a mistake\". Instead, we should ignore his \"poisonous\" prescription and push for the only medicine he fails to suggest: \"a programme of major tax cuts\".</p> <p>Polly Toynbee in the Guardian, however, exhorts those who urge compulsory saving schemes to \"beware all kinds of siren voices in this debate who will not speak for the weak: the chancellor has always had to resist the louder, more populist demands of the strong\". Her plea is echoed in the Guardian's leader which says there is a \"strong case\" for \"the commission to be radical\" and require contributions from all employers, all employees and to end Beveridge's insurance principle.</p> <p>The FT offers a note of optimism amid the gloom. It believes \"a surprising degree of consensus is beginning to emerge on what needs to be done, from raising the retirement age and making it easier for people to stay at work as they get older, to reducing reliance on means-testing and creating better incentives for saving\".</p> <p>However it is the pensions timetable which concerns the FT's commentators. Turner's final report will not emerge until after the next election and the FT notebook's Robert Shrimsley worries that Turner \"has let both the parties and the public off the hook. Instead of confronting voters with an issue of lifetime importance, it forces them to devolve it to others\". </p> <p>According to the Times's Simon Jenkins \"there are two things to remember about pensions. First, they are stupefyingly dull. Secondly, when push comes to shove, they bring out the worst in everyone\".</p> <p>Jenkins's first point will no doubt be shared by many newspaper readers this morning. His second is exemplified by the Express's bitter front page headline: \"Pay through the nose or work till you drop. Unless, of course, you are a State employee.\"</p> <p>Turner did not apportion blame in his report, but the Mail's leader has a pretty good idea where to look: \"It may not be the government's fault that Britain is aging. But in the way it has handled this issue - right from the beginning, when its own actuaries ludicrously failed to spot that the population was growing older - its every decision has turned a problem into a crisis.\" </p> <p>Not forgetting, of course, the culpability of the public sector and, er, the Guardian's Society supplement: \"How can people afford to save for old age, when so much money is wasted on the kind of rampant welfarism visible in the 120-page public jobs supplement in every Wednesday's Guardian?\" How indeed?</p> <p>*<a href=\"http://money.theguardian.com/pensionsincrisis/story/0,12199,1326164,00.html\">We cannot allow the poor to fall into the pensions abyss</a><br> *<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/10/13/dl1302.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/10/13/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Save pensions - cut taxes</a><br> *<a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,482-1306548,00.html\">Times: Let them eat tax credits</a><br> *<a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/c078eeaa-1966-11d9-80e1-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: From complacency to crisis</a><br></p> <p><b>STRAW WITHDRAWS 45-MINUTE CLAIM</b></p> <p>Having splashed the pensions crisis in a most scintillating manner yesterday, the Independent goes its own sweet way again today by chucking all mention of pensions off its front page in favour of Jack Straw's special Commons statement that the claim that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes was false. </p> <p>The paper exclaims that \"the most astonishing thing about the 45-minute claim is that before it was withdrawn yesterday by the Government for being wrong, it had caused one death, at least one inquiry and the decapitation of the BBC\" and suggests in its leader that the statement is part of the government's \"subtle and shameless retreat\". The Times calls it \"a further embarrassment for the Government and MI6\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, the international nuclear watchdog (the IAEA) has raised the alarm over the disappearance of equipment and material bought by Saddam Hussein's regime that could be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.

According to George Bush, he is also on a \"noble mission\" to negotiate Iraqi debt relief.</p> <p>But, says Klein, \"the goal of maximising Iraq's debt payments directly contradicts the stated US foreign policy aim of drastically reducing Iraq's debt burden\". Klein reckons the deal being struck by Carlyle with Kuwait is so large it is hard to see how Mr Baker could be prevented from benefiting. And Kathleen Clark, a law professor and leading expert on government ethics, says: \"Even if Baker is somehow being screened from profiting from this deal, Carlyle is using Baker's government position to benefit themselves.\"</p> <p>*<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1326037,00.html\">Bush special envoy embroiled in controversy over Iraq debt</a><br> </p> <p> <b>BABY SHOT IN CAR ATTACK</b></p> <p>The Telegraph finds room on its front for the latest gun crime victim: an 18-month-old girl who was hit in the leg when a man fired up to 15 shots into a car in Hackney, east London.

According to the Times's countryside editor, farmers are having to implement \"pumpkin protection measures\", including \"round-the-clock watches\" and \"fearsome guard dogs\" to safeguard their Halloween harvest from gangs who have struck three times in the past week and \"stolen scores of pumpkins\". Apparently one night's haul of 15-25 pumpkins \"could raise as much as \u00a3150\", and would most likely be offered for sale \"on market stalls or by street traders\". It's a menace that must be squashed. </p> <p>*<a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,172-1306475,00.html\">Rustlers find there's gold in them thar pumpkins</a><br> </p> <p> <b> COMING UP ON GUARDIAN UNLIMITED TODAY</b></p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/0,2759,423009,00.html\">All the background on the Baker controversy over Iraq's debts</a><br></p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;<a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?50@@.77475454\">Al-Qaida expert Jason Burke chats live online</a><br></p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;<a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com\">Prime Minister's Questions - live coverage</a><br></p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown yesterday underlined his determination to play a key role in Labour's general election strategy by making clear he will be responsible for much of the manifesto on which the party will fight for a third term. </p> <p>The chancellor peppered a speech in the north-east, where he was campaigning for a Yes vote in the forthcoming devolution referendum, with his election priorities - principally measures to narrow regional divisions by improving education and encouraging enterprise. </p> <p>Backed by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, who is the architect of plans for an elected north-east assembly, Mr Brown made it clear that he would not be sidelined by the party's newly installed election coordinator, Alan Milburn, MP for Darlington. </p> <p>A week before 1.9 million electors in the north-east receive voting papers for the all-postal referendum on November 4, the chancellor told the business community in Newcastle upon Tyne that an assembly was essential to counter the dominance of the south-east. </p> <p>Amid a sea of Labour posters and leaflets lamenting the economic weakness of the north-east and the growing strength of London, Mr Brown maintained that regional inequalities were not inevitable. </p> <p>But he cautioned: \"Balanced economic growth becomes impossible if we have unemployment and emigration and the under-use of resources in one part of the country and congestion and overcrowding and huge inflationary pressures in the other.\" </p> <p>With jobless rates in the north-east almost twice those in the south-east, he maintained that an elected assembly would help to re-balance England. </p> <p>\"There is nothing inevitable about regional inequalities,\" he said. \"The north-south divide is not and should never be treated as a permanent feature of the British economy.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown, who has forged a strong alliance with the deputy prime minister to push for greater decentralisation to the English regions - particularly in the north - used his speech to highlight the need for far-reaching reforms in the workplace and in the school. </p> <p>But, time and again, he referred to the forthcoming election campaign. \"The theme of this referendum and the coming general election manifesto will be the economic reforms we've got to make, region by region, to become more competitive, productive, prosperous, wealthy, as a nation,\" he said, in the first of a string of references to a \"third term manifesto\". </p> <p>Later, visiting the Millennium Bridge, which links the Newcastle-Gateshead waterfronts, the chancellor was asked whether he would be writing the manifesto. \"I am doing the economic brief and I'll be having the pre-budget report and the budget, and that will, of course, influence the manifesto,\" he replied cautiously. </p> <p>Earlier, addressing the businesspeople, John Prescott joked that he was the chancellor's \"agent\", before pleading with his audience not to draw any \"misinterpretation\" from a throwaway line. \"I'm back on the campaign trail,\" he enthused. </p> <p>\"It's about the north leading the way. You have been demanding to have more 'say' about things ... a chance to make your own decisions instead of them being made by quangoes and all sorts of government departments.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown said he had been a supporter of north-east devolution since the early 1980s, when he first met Mr Prescott - then opposition regions spokesman. </p> <p>But opinion surveys show many voters have still to make up their minds, with one today in a local newspaper giving the No campaign the advantage. </p> <p>Campaign posters underline the nervousness of devolution supporters, with some proclaiming: \"This is our chance - let's not waste it.\" </p> <p>While some were impressed by Mr Brown's performance at yesterday's events, several key businesspeople claimed the chancellor and deputy prime minister had grossly overplayed the influence of a north-east assembly. </p> <p>One said the package on offer was \"barely worth having\" because Whitehall would control so many strings.</p>",
  "If George Bush loses the US election in three weeks' time, he and all the senior members of his national security team will be out on their ears next January. <p>If he wins, a frenzy of in-fighting, intrigue and back-stabbing over who gets, or keeps, the top jobs in a second Bush administration will instantly ensue. </p> <p>In some ways, this quadrennial Washington ritual has already begun. The national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, has recently come under withering fire for what is happening in Iraq. </p> <p>\"If Rice did her job and told Bush how ludicrous the case was for an Iraqi nuclear programme, then Bush terribly misled the public,\" the New York Times said last week. </p> <p>\"If not, she should have resigned for allowing her boss to start a war on the basis of bad information and incompetent analysis.\" </p> <p>The newspaper said the reputation of Colin Powell, the secretary of state, had also been \"gravely damaged\" by his misleading prewar UN presentation on Iraqi weapons capability. </p> <p>Mr Powell, habitually described as a moderating voice in the administration, has sent mixed signals about staying on. The former general has lost more bruising internal political battles than he has won. While Mr Bush may want to keep him, Mr Powell may lack the stomach for it. </p> <p>The former CIA director George Tenet has already fallen on his sword. He resigned abruptly in June, citing personal reasons. But his departure handily preceded publication of the highly critical, official report on the September 11 attacks. </p> <p>Yet among those still holding high office, the position of Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, looks weakest of all. Fierce controversy and extraordinary misjudgments have marked his time at the Pentagon. Washington insiders suggest the fact he was not sacked long ago reflects Mr Bush's visceral reluctance to admit that serious mistakes have been made in Iraq and the \"war on terror\". But whether the remarkable Mr Rumsfeld, 72, will keep his post in a second Bush administration is another matter entirely. </p> <p>His job record makes dramatic and disturbing reading. It was he who gave the world Camp X-Ray at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and the concept of an \"enemy combatant\" lacking all legal rights. It was he who presided over the Abu Ghraib prison abuses in Iraq. </p> <p>And it was Mr Rumsfeld who oversaw the secret deployment of special forces snatch squads to imprison or assassinate suspected \"high-value\" al-Qaida operatives, in breach of international law. </p> <p>By general agreement, he disastrously underestimated the number of troops needed to secure Afghanistan and Iraq, and fired or sidelined officers who disagreed with him. He failed to anticipate the Iraqi insurgency, flippantly dismissing post-invasion chaos with quips like \"stuff happens\" and \"freedom is untidy\". </p> <p>The Pentagon also backed the wrong political horse in the form of Ahmad Chalabi. </p> <p>Simultaneously, Mr Rumsfeld was alienating the Nato allies, whom the US now very much needs, with divisive remarks about \"old\" and \"new\" Europe. His ill-concealed contempt for the UN further undermined US aims. </p> <p>And all along he was among the most forceful proponents of bogus WMD claims and of supposed links between Saddam and al-Qaida. Last week, to gasps of incredulity, he briefly stated that no such links existed before claiming he was \"misunderstood\". </p> <p>Mr Rumsfeld tends to laugh off criticism. \"I'm a survivor,\" he boasted during a visit to Iraq last May. </p> <p>With this kind of CV, it seems improbable that he will make the cut a second time round. </p> <p>But first, Mr Bush needs to secure his own job.</p>",
  "<p>A stranger approached Karen Shook in a supermarket last year. \"He asked if I could still have sex because I was in a wheelchair,\" says Shook, laughing as she recalls the incident. \"I told him 'Yes, as long as I put the brakes on.' Then he told me off for being rude!\" </p> <p>Elena, who is also disabled, laughs too as she recalls a recent encounter with a taxi driver. \"As he drove me home, he just came out with: 'Well, you must be a lesbian. You can't fancy men because you're in a wheelchair.'\" </p> <p>People, as Shook points out, make curiously narrow assumptions when it comes to disabled people's sexuality - or non-sexuality as it is more commonly perceived. Consciously or not, it appears our airbrushed society wants to assume that only the physically perfect should be getting laid. The general view is that disabled people don't have sex. As with elderly people and the underaged, we prefer to believe they're safely tucked up in bed alone. </p> <p>\"The mass view seems to be that people with disabilities are asexual, and whose only needs are to be washed and fed,\" says Dipa, who has a progressive mobility impairment. \"People with disabilities are cared for as children - you're infantilised - and people don't want to see children as sexual beings.\" </p> <p>When was the last time you saw a disabled couple have sex on TV, or a disabled person portrayed in the mainstream media as anything other than \"brave\" or \"tragic\"? Disabled sex is taboo, but denying its existence has never made it go away. Some argue that, by denying a sex life, we deny disabled people their full human rights. </p> <p>Disabled people who want a sexual relationship are not just up against the perception that they don't have sex. There are practical issues. A couple need to meet first before they can have a relationship. Transport and access issues can deter disabled people from going out to socialise, as can poverty. Often, the institutional world around disabled people appears to be conspiring against them having sex and relationships. </p> <p>Ron, who is visually impaired, uses a specialist dating agency. \"I've tried normal dating agencies and they won't accept disabled people,\" he claims. </p> <p>For those disabled people who live in care institutions, lack of privacy can be a problem. Staff walk into bedrooms unannounced. Some Christian homes will allow only the residents' married partners to visit their bedrooms, and for disabled people living at home, relatives can be overprotective. For those who are cared for by their spouse, it can be difficult to maintain sexual mystique when their partner has to dress, bathe and take them to the toilet. The choice and control necessary to conduct a satisfying sexual relationship are not always present. </p> <p>There is little in the way of easily accessible, specialist advice on sex and relationships for disabled people. At least two helplines have closed in the past couple of years - one, Regard, ceased when its lottery funding ran out, and a second, Spod, was wound up because of staff and money problems. More general helpline services are not always helpful. </p> <p>Elena, who has cerebral palsy, tells of when she rang a national charity to discuss her relationship problems. The person who took her call also had cerebral palsy, but the advice was strangely unsympathetic. She says: \"I was told I should be married and that I'd have to start IVF treatment immediately if I ever wanted children. I hung up feeling very depressed.\" </p> <p>Simon Barnes was disabled by a spinal injury at 21. He had been sexually active for several years before the accident. \"When you can no longer sow your seed, part of your masculinity is taken away,\" says Barnes. \"But it doesn't stop your sexual urges.\" </p> <p>He was lucky, he says. Initially he was confused about how to get sexual satisfaction. \"It was 1984 and there was no psychological counselling like there is now.\" But he had a relationship with a nurse he met at the hospital, who, he says, \"showed me the ropes\". </p> <p>\"I realised that although part of my sexuality couldn't be expressed like it used to be, there was still a huge part that could. I was introduced to the joys of kissing, caressing and stroking, which many abled bodied men miss out on.\" </p> <p>Others have not been so lucky, either because of their attitude, or lack of counselling. \"Some men I met in hospital decided that they would never have another intimate relationship,\" says Barnes. \"And 20 years on, I know they have stuck to that.\" </p> <p>The Outsiders charity believes it is unique. It has members worldwide and is cited on the internet, in books and in resource packs. Its founder, Tuppy Owens, has been running Outsiders since 1979 and still doesn't know of anyone else who does what they do - which is to talk openly about sex and disability. </p> <p>Its UK branches meet regularly to discuss relationship issues. It provides information and books and organises social events. There is also a website with a practical suggestions page that deals with issues ranging from \"I'm pregnant and have a disability\" to \"I'm a transvestite and need a woman who understands\". </p> <p>Elena says Outsiders changed her life. \"I rejoined the organisation this year after splitting up with my partner. I had absolutely no confidence left. Since April, I've been working in the Outsiders [north London] offices and I've done some modelling for their promotional postcards. I've got my confidence back and feel I'm becoming the person I want to be.\" </p> <p>According to Owens, other disability organisations are nervous about sex for a range of reasons. \"This year, I wrote to 32 charities to try to form alliances and not one wrote back with a definite yes,\" she says. \"They're all very wary. I think they assume because we deal with sex we're suspicious.\" </p> <p>Their concerns, she suspects, may well reflect a wariness of courting what might be seen as unwelcome publicity. But disability providers have to assess what sort of formal help and assistance should be provided. In the Netherlands, a state-funded provider, SAR, offers a prostitution service for disabled people. In the UK, the legal and moral climate makes that more difficult. </p> <p>Leonard Cheshire, a major disability service provider, has a \"personal relationships policy\". Ann Smyth, the charity's quality and standards adviser, explains: \"These are to ensure that disabled people who have relationships maintain them, and to work towards initiating relationships for disabled people who want a partner.\" </p> <p>In practice, she says, \" it could mean providing transport for a gay person to visit a gay club, or it could be the provision of a double bed for a couple who both live in an institution. It could even stretch to undressing a disabled person and physically putting them in a position to have sex - although I must stress that only the appropriate staff would undertake this.\" Plain speaking, she says, is necessary. \"It's time to stop pretending disability and sex isn't there.\" </p> <p>Leonard Cheshire publishes a resource pack that covers all aspects of relationships and sexuality, such as friendships, sex education, masturbation and the use of prostitutes. There are strict rules on the latter. A member of staff could dial the number of the prostitute if requested, or they could drive the user to the appointment. But the meeting could not be on Leonard Cheshire property and nor could the staff member accept a reward. Staff members who object on moral grounds can refuse to be involved. </p> <p>Perhaps the most difficult impairment to reconcile with a healthy sex life is learning disability. Victoria McKenzie, a sex counsellor, says the big issue is consent. \"Sexuality is a right, not a privilege,\" she says. \"However, people with learning disabilities must understand that sex is a choice and it has consequences. </p> <p>\"A lot of these people, women in particular, are sexually abused. In the New York state where I worked for a not-for-profit agency, it was estimated by the district attorney's office that up to 90% of women with learning difficulties had been sexually abused by their 18th birthday. </p> <p>\"We created a tool to assess ability to give consent,\" explains McKenzie. \"We wanted them to have the same rights to a sex life as anyone else, but we needed to know they weren't being exploited.\" </p> <p>Most of the time, the process ended in advice on contraception or pregnancy. Occasionally, the relationship would go before a \"human rights commitee\". If abuse was detected, measures such as ensuring clients were not left alone together would be put in place. </p> <p>Generally speaking though, sex and disability remains taboo. Owens says one way ahead is to educate carers \"so that they're not protecting the disabled from having a good time\". </p> <p>Remembering to put the brakes on helps, too. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Some surnames have been withheld to prevent identification.

  "<b>Iraq</b> <br> The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, defiantly insisted Britain was right to go to war with Iraq despite findings that it had no weapons of mass destruction at the time. <p>Mr Straw acknowledged some of the intelligence used to support the case for war was \"wrong\" but added: \"I continue to believe the judgments we made and the actions we took were right.\" </p> <p>The foreign secretary's comments came after the Iraq Survey Group reported last week that Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction at the time of the conflict. </p> <p>Mr Straw condemned the capture and subsequent murder of Kenneth Bigley as \"acts of utter barbarism\". </p> <p>Gary Streeter, for the Tories, said the Bigley family had borne their tragedy \"with great dignity and courage\". </p> <p>Mr Streeter said: \"The situation in Iraq would be far less grave if there had been proper planning for the post-war reconstruction.\" </p> <p><b>Climate change</b><br> The foreign secretary was urged to stop \"playing patsy\" with the US over climate change and use tough tactics to get it to sign the Kyoto Protocol. </p> <p>Labour's Desmond Turner made his plea amid controversy over figures showing soaring levels of carbon dioxide - blamed for global warming. But Mr Straw insisted efforts were being made \"at every level\" to convince the US to join much of the rest of the world in signing the agreement. </p> <p><b>Middle East</b><br> Mr Straw insisted the Middle East \"road map\" peace plan \"is not dead\" and praised the Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon's proposed withdrawal from Gaza as \"courageous\". </p> <p><b>Hunting</b><br> Environment minister Lord Whitty warned peers they were in \"the last chance saloon\" over the bill banning hunting with hounds. He spelled out a tough message during the hunting bill's second reading debate and cautioned against confrontation with MPs who have overwhelmingly backed a ban, instead urging pro-hunting peers to seek a way forward out of the row that has rumbled on since Labour came to power. </p> <p>Lady Byford, for the Tories, pledged that a future Conservative government would provide time to reconsider reversal of any ban in the next parliament. </p> <p>Labour's Lady Mallalieu, president of the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance, urged a compromise solution of regulated hunting. But she warned that if a ban becomes law \"respect for parliament, for its ability to protect the freedom of minorities and respect for the due process of law will break down in a number of parts of the country\". </p> <p><b>Civil partnerships</b><br> The government pledged to overturn an attempt by peers to derail legislation that would effectively legalise gay marriage. Equality minister Jacqui Smith said the Lords was aiming to \"wreck\" the plans when it extended new rights for same-sex couples to long-term carers and family members. </p> <p>She warned that peers' amendments would make the civil partnerships bill unworkable and claimed that some of those who had backed them were anti-gay. </p> <p>Alan Duncan, the only openly gay Tory MP, backed the bill from the frontbench, insisting it promoted Conservative values. He denied civil partnerships amounted to \"gay marriage\" or undermined marriage, insisting the two institutions were on \"similar ... but parallel lines\". But former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe warned that the bill was \"wrong\" and would undermine the uniqueness of marriage. </p> <p><b>Pensions</b><br> A pensions boost for gay couples was announced by junior Scottish minister Anne McGuire. She said in future same-sex couples would be able to benefit from deceased partners' public service pensions. </p> <p><b>Parliamentary building work</b><br> Building work on the parliamentary estate during the summer recess was \"generally\" to acceptable health and safety standards, it emerged. The finding follows MPs' complaints that their safety was compromised by work that was going on when they returned from the August break. </p> <p>Liberal Democrat Sir Archy Kirkwood, representing the House of Commons Commission, said an internal investigation concluded that health and safety in construction projects in the Palace of Westminster had \"significantly improved\" in recent years. </p> <p><b>Rites of passage</b><br> Children should take part in naming and coming of age ceremonies to help counteract \"uncivilised behaviour\" in communities, Labour former minister Frank Field urged. His rite of passage (welcoming and coming of age) bill would ensure parents organised a civil naming ceremony for their child within 21 days of birth. </p> <p>The child would then take part in a formal coming of age ceremony when they were about 14 which would set out their rights and responsibilities to society. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>The prime minister and the Tory leader, Michael Howard, face each other at question time. Earlier, the international development secretary, Hilary Benn, responds to MPs. Tories open a debate on pensions. Topics of backbench debates in Westminster Hall include MRSA in hospitals and planning inspectorate guidance on compulsory demolition. </p> <p>The Lords debates the housing bill's report stage and internet pornography.</p>",
  "Britain has a \"very, very small\" gun-crime problem but it needs to be \"nipped in the bud before it snowballs out of control\", a former top US police officer told MPs yesterday. <p>Paul Evans, former Boston police commissioner and now head of the Home Office's police standards unit, said it was essential that those who supplied firearms to young people paid a heavy price. </p> <p>Mr Evans, credited with driving down violent crime in Boston during his 10 years as commissioner, said it was essential to use an \"intelligence-led approach\" that identified the \"impact players\" who were carrying guns, as well as enlisting the active support of the community. </p> <p>At the same meeting of the Commons home affairs select committee, the chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Keith Povey, said it was important to remember that gun crime represented 0.02% of overall crime, and that deaths from shootings had fallen from 93 two years ago to 81 last year. </p> <p>\"But it is very difficult to overcome a random shooting of the kind that took place in Nottingham that has a very serious impact on people's fear of crime,\" he told MPs. </p> <p>Mr Evans said there were lessons from his Boston experience: \"One thing that is absolutely critical when dealing with gun violence is identifying the source of the firearms, the guns that are coming into play, and making sure there is a heavy price to pay for those individuals who supply firearms to young people.\" </p> <p>He said there were statutes in Boston that ensured that those who were convicted of selling guns to juveniles faced stiffer penalties. </p> <p>But he argued against blanket stops and searches of young people in high gun-crime areas, saying that it was more important to follow a \"national intelligence model\" to identify those thought to carry firearms. \"It is critical that the police have a pretty good idea who is engaged in dealing in drugs, and you target those people. You really focus on the 'impact players'.\" </p> <p>Mr Evans added that they were often well known to the criminal justice system. </p> <p>But he also said it was important to adopt a community-based approach - with the police and prosecutors working with street workers, clergy, community workers; and clearly giving them the message that the community would get extra assistance in terms of grants and help - but on the basis that \"we will not let you kill each other\". </p> <p>Sir Keith Povey said that gun crime was highly concentrated in parts of London, with small pockets in the West Midlands, the Manchester area and in Nottingham.</p>",
  "<p>The United States attorney's office has opened an investigation into last week's closure of a Liverpool factory that led to a drastic shortage in flu vaccines in the US and Britain. </p> <p>British authorities suspended the plant's licence for three months following the announcement in August that a batch of flu vaccines had been contaminated. </p> <p>Chiron, the American owner of the factory, said it had received a subpoena from the US attorney's office in New York requesting documents related to its flu vaccine, Fluvirin. The subpoena also seeks information on the suspension of the licence by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The company would give no further details. </p> <p>The suspension led to the loss of 46m to 48m doses of flu vaccine - almost half the US supply - creating a potential crisis as winter approaches. The other supplier is the French group Sanofi-Aventis. </p> <p>The US has asked people at lower risk to leave supplies for the more vulnerable, including the elderly. GlaxoSmithKline said this week it was in talks with regulators to sell its flu vaccine in the US. </p> <p>Analysts said the inquiry could focus on how promptly the firm disclosed the problems or on quality control at its plants. California-based Chiron acquired the plant as part of its takeover of PowderJect Pharmaceuticals in June 2003. </p> <p>The suspension of the British licence has led to hand-wringing in the US over why the food and drug administration did not act earlier. The FDA has rejected reports that it knew, or should have known, about the plant's problems.</p>",
  "<p>The glitz and glamour of Las Vegas is being brought to north-west London with plans for a \u00a3335m hotel, gambling and leisure complex to be built next to the new Wembley stadium. </p> <p>Caesars Entertainment, the owner of the world-famous Caesars Palace, has linked up with Quintain Estates, the property company that is rejuvenating Wembley Arena and the surrounding area, in a joint venture to develop the site. </p> <p>Alongside a 400-room nine-storey hotel, Caesars Wembley will include restaurants, shops, a spa and swimming pool, a ballroom and a casino offering everything from slot machines to roulette and blackjack tables. </p> <p>The plan, which depends on proposed changes to British gambling law as well as local planning permission, will create 1,750 jobs. </p> <p>The 50-50 venture between Caesars and Quintain is aiming to have the complex open in 2008, two years after the stadium has played host to its first FA Cup final. </p> <p>\"People in the past came to Wembley an hour before kick-off and left as soon as they could get out of the car park,\" said Quintain property director Nick Shattock yesterday. \"We want to create a day out for them.\" The planned casino and hotel stretches over 13 acres and will be 200 yards from Wembley stadium, on one side of a public space about the size of Leicester Square in central London. </p> <p>Caesars Wembley will slot in with Quintain's existing Wembley regeneration project. The developer has already begun work on a \u00a31.3bn scheme - called stage one - which covers 42 acres around the new national stadium. </p> <p>It is shutting Wembley Arena next January and will spend 10 months and \u00a325m renovating the concert arena. The stage one plans include 3,700 homes and a major leisure and retail complex that will create a further 6,100 jobs. </p> <p>Caesars Entertainment has 28 casinos around the world but the American giant's Wembley venture will be its first foray into Europe. </p> <p>Caesars Entertainment president Wallace Barr yesterday promised \"the full Las Vegas experience\" at Wembley. \"It will not be of the scope and size of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas... but it certainly will have the quality,\" he said. </p> <p>Alongside a 200-seat, 24-hour cafe, there will be a host of restaurants and a mammoth casino with 110 gaming tables and 1,250 slot machines. </p> <p>There is also the possibility that Caesar's will use both the stadium and arena to host major sports events, using its brand to attract fans. Caesar's in Las Vegas has played host to heavyweight boxing matches, tennis and even gymnastics. </p> <p>The \u00a3750m Wembley stadium complex, however, has been dogged by problems. Earlier this year the great showpiece arch's elevation was delayed after computer checks detected welding weaknesses. </p> <p>There has also been speculation that the project is running behind schedule. Multiplex, the Australian company coordinating the rebuilding effort, has contracted with Wembley National Stadium, a wholly owned FA subsidiary, to have the stadium ready by January 2006. </p> <p>But Multiplex has stated publicly that Wembley will be ready by September 2005. Yesterday Quintain's Mr Shattock admitted \"the suggestion in the market is that [Multiplex] might be a little slow but they have not said anything yet.\"</p>",
  "Between Oil City, Pennsylvania and Canton, Ohio, a hilly, leafy terrain gives way to a landscape as flat and appealing as warm Pepsi. Arriving in Canton on Interstate 77 you pass a Hoover plant, which has laid off more than 800 workers in the past seven months, and then a huge religious billboard asking: \"Saved?\" and offering a number to call. <p>Between them they represent the two countervailing trends that are shaping the election here - the decline in heavy industry and the rise of holy doctrine. </p> <p>Ohio is not just a swing state for this election; it is a bellwether state accustomed to picking the winner in almost every election. No Republican has ever won the White House without taking it; Democrats have only done so twice. </p> <p>And if Ohio is a marker of the national mood, Stark County (population 377,519), in which Canton is the main town, is the best indicator of what Ohio is thinking, backing the right candidate for president every election bar one over the past 40 years. </p> <p>As Ohio goes, so goes the nation; as Stark County goes, so goes Ohio. </p> <p>Stark County came by its status honestly. Its 576 square miles span cornfields, steel plants, suburbs and slums. </p> <p>It couldn't be anywhere in America - its plains are too plain to be anywhere other than the Midwest - but with the exception of Latinos it has a proportionate piece of everything and everybody. </p> <p>\"We have this reputation by virtue of the accident that all the major demographic groups are represented here,\" says John Green, director of the University of Akron's Bliss Institute for Applied Politics. \"It's a microcosm of the state.\" </p> <p>Of the many stops that Bush has made to Ohio since he was elected, one stands out. In April last year he visited a research facility for the steel and bearings factory Timken, in Canton. </p> <p>Alongside him stood \"Tim\" Timken who earned a seat on the Ohio delegation at the Republican convention this year by raising more than $200,000 (around \u00a3110,000) for Bush. </p> <p>\"The greatest strength of the American economy is found right here, right in this room,\" said Mr Bush. </p> <p>\"I know you're optimistic about the future of this company, and I'm optimistic about the future of our country.\" </p> <p>Almost exactly a year later Timken announced plans to close down three of its bearings factories, putting 1,300 people out of work. In a county where unemployment stands at 10% and a city that has lost 3,700 jobs since Mr Bush came to office, the news hits hard. </p> <p>A woman walking out of Stark County's job centre, The Employment Source, stops me without introduction. </p> <p>\"I don't know about you but the world seems to bite you in the ass an awful lot nowadays,\" she says. </p> <p>Inside several people have been bitten hard and keep on trying to bite back. </p> <p>Gail Wilson worked in human resources until she was \"job eliminated\" in June 2002. Since then she has been taking temporary work whenever she can get it and learning new computer skills while her two sons tide her over. </p> <p>\"I've lowered the bar over the years,\" she says. \"My last job I earned more than $20 an hour, but I'm looking at $10 an hour now because I need the work. I never would have supported Bush but now I'm telling everyone I know they've got to go for Kerry.\" </p> <p>As well as hardening up soft voters, Mr Kerry may also be buoyed by the swell of new voters on the rolls. </p> <p>Democratic areas of Ohio, where registration ended last week, have seen a 250% rise in new voters, compared with a 25% growth in Republican areas. In Stark county, where Bush won by 3%, there has been a relatively modest but nonetheless significant 6% increase in new voters. </p> <p>Yet Mr Bush still holds a narrow lead in Stark County, pipping Kerry by 46% to 44% with 9% still undecided in a poll released last week by the local newspaper The Repository. </p> <p>\"I'm going to vote for Bush,\" says a Timkens worker coming off the afternoon shift who refused to be named. </p> <p>\"He's screwing us with jobs, but I'm against abortion and Bush has stepped up over the war and I don't think Kerry would have. I can get another job. But you can't get another set of principles or another country if we get attacked again.\" </p> <p>Chris Paxos, 26, who recently lost his job as a salesman for a small building maintenance company, adds: \"I'm going to vote for Bush because he believes if you make money you get to keep it. And he's for gun rights.\" </p> <p>Does Mr Paxos have a gun? \"No, but my parents do. I grew up around guns and I think you should be able to keep them.\" </p> <p>\"You'd think people would worry more about the issues that affect their daily lives,\" says Stan Jasionowski, president of United Steelworkers of America union Local 1123, which represents the bearings workers at Timken. </p> <p>\"But people keep bringing up abortion, gun control and gay rights.\" </p> <p>On polling day there will also be a referendum on the ballot to ban gay marriage, a ploy to mobilise the republican base. </p> <p>\"The economy is an important issue,\" says Mr Green. \"But more people have concerns premised on other things like foreign policy matters or social issues. The new voters could make a difference, but nobody knows who they are and just because they are registered doesn't mean they will vote.\" </p> <p>Down at 540 Eagle, one of the two gay bars in town, Bob Blackburn has just come off his shift in the steel mill, where he drives a forklift truck. He's backing Kerry but the Republican emphasis on gay marriage doesn't surprise him. \"If they don't have somebody to beat up on they're in trouble. They need an enemy and they've decided to make us the enemy,\" he says. </p> <p>When people lose their job in America, more often than not, it is not just injurious to their bank balance but to their health. With no national health service, most people's health insurance is tied to their job. \"For small problems I can go to the free clinic,\" says Ms Wilson. \"But if I got a catastrophic illness I would be up a creek without a paddle.\" </p> <p>\"It just takes a little crisis and you're finished,\" says Donna Berkebile, program director of the Stark County Hunger Task Force, which has seen a 25% increase in people using its services over the past few years. </p> <p>\"Your child gets sick, you take them to the doctor and there goes the food money.\" </p> <p>Joan Iarussi has faced some major crises in the past few years, but she's nowhere near finished. On June 8 she went in to Hoover one morning, as she had done for 17 years, to be told her job as a software engineer had been \"terminated\". </p> <p>Two years earlier her 52-year-old husband, who was a skilled steel worker, took early retirement as his company sought redundancies. After his company went under he found his pension was worth 20% of what he had been promised, after the government refused to underwrite it. </p> <p>Still unable to find a job, Ms Iarussi is re-training; Mr Iarussi is cutting grass at the Hoover High School for less than a third of what he earned a few years ago. \"It was like a death,\" she says, referring to the loss of her job. \"It's my job to fix it and I'm looking for a plan.\" </p> <p>She doesn't yet know how she is going to vote: Mr Kerry seems too wishy-washy, while Mr Bush too stubborn. </p> <p>\"I want to know that they have a plan in the same way I have a plan.\" she says. \"And I have to believe that their plan will work. I want my situation to improve with their plan and I want the world to improve with their plan. My little picture of the American dream is fading pretty fast.\" </p> <p>As often happens with those who make up their mind late, if Ms Iarussi does not hear what she wants by polling day she will vote against the incumbent. \"I think we have given Bush a chance,\" she says. \"I have had to reinvent myself to look for a new job. He could too.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Next stop, Dearborn, Michigan</p>",
  "Pensions are complicated. Few understand them, and too many pull the bedclothes over their head and hope to die before they get old. Facts, facts, facts is what Adair Turner produced yesterday, in an encyclopaedic overview of such towering informational and intellectual immensity that his analysis is unlikely to be seriously challenged. <p>The pensions abyss is deep and wide: in 10 years, people will start to retire a great deal poorer than they expected, unless something is done. What exactly? He produced four options, each unpalatable, each involving people paying more - and there is no other option, however much political parties wriggle. Pay more tax, pay more into private pensions, work longer, do a bit of all three, or starve in old age. This report may itself cause some healthy panic to start people saving more. </p> <p>Turner hopes, he says, that a political \"consensus\" will arise to fix a united policy for the next 50 years ... but elderly pigs might fly. Pensions are political, not a technical matter for actuaries to sort out while everyone else gets a life. The decisions that are made when Turner produces his final report next year will reflect deep attitudes towards the distribution of wealth and how much fairer or less fair society should be. </p> <p>Although this mighty report covers the spectrum of pensions, let us concentrate here on how it might affect the poorest. There is a grave danger that through the lazy not getting their minds around this, a consensus is slowly congealing around a call for an end to means testing and a return to a more \"simple\" system, without all Gordon Brown's fussy credits that confuse the poor old dears. Yesterday some Labour MPs were calling for \"simplicity\" with no means testing, which would amount to a redistribution from poorer to richer pensioners. There is much misinformation in the air. </p> <p>Let's start with what Labour has done so far. There has been the biggest rise in spending on pensions in history. An extra \u00a310bn has lifted 1.8 million old people out of abject poverty through the means-tested pension credit, giving them an average \u00a341.70 - taking them above the poverty threshold to \u00a3105 a week. They will never again fall back into poverty as the credit is linked to earnings. </p> <p>But this targeting is now coming under attack. Its critics want to put all the available money in the universal basic pension: that too has risen by 7% in real terms though, linked only to prices, its real value would fall back in time. But with the winter-fuel allowance and Labour's free TV licence for the over 75s, even the well-off do better out of their state pensions. </p> <p>Without doubt, Labour did the right and the brave thing. It would have been far more popular to put all the money into the universal basic pension, with many more satisfied voters and good, clear headlines. Poor pensioners, two thirds of them women, are politically silent: it would have paid better political dividends to please the more vocal better-off. </p> <p>It is not surprising that David Willetts for the Tories proposes a direct transfer from the poorer to the richer. He would link the basic pension to earnings, so it rises with the country's general wealth, while unlinking the pension credit for the poorest, so they get poorer. He promises a fine election bribe for the many - \u00a37 a week extra to all - but it is money to be taken from the poor. </p> <p>This would be shocking plunder were it not for the one great failure in the government's policy. A third of poor pensioners don't claim pension credit, leaving a million people to live on the basic pension with little or nothing else, in a poverty that is beyond contemplating. </p> <p>Why? It's hard to get a straight answer. Research has shown that the idea that they are too proud is mostly nonsense. The government has been astonishingly incompetent, since they already pay these missing claimants their pension every week. They know who they are; they know where they live, but half-hearted take-up campaigns haven't worked. If a census of every household can be done in one day, it should not be beyond the wit of the Department for Work and Pensions to knock on the door of every single one of them to help them fill out the now simple forms. </p> <p>If not, the government will lose the argument for targeting. David Willetts says, with some truth as well as some disingenuousness, that abolishing means testing and increasing the universal pension would at least get all the poor pensioners a bit more, instead of leaving a third of them with nothing. </p> <p>A groundswell of vested interests examining the tough Turner choices are inevitably inclined towards the options that are least helpful to the poorest. The CBI wants the pension age raised to 70, to save employers money: it was seen off sharply by pensions minister Alan Johnson yesterday, who pointed out that most working-class men in his constituency would only get a year or two in retirement, they die so young. The TUC has always advocated a high basic pension, without means testing. The Association of British Insurers says that means testing makes selling pensions harder. </p> <p>Those who want compulsory saving should remember that it's mainly the poor who don't save, and the rich who do. The Tories want to spread the money evenly, as it's a political winner. Beware all kinds of siren voices in this debate who will not speak for the weak: the chancellor has always had to resist the louder, more populist demands of the strong. </p> <p>So why not just raise the basic pension to a survivable level for all, and raise extra tax to pay for it? It sounds simple, popular and progressive. The hard answer from the chancellor's people is this: if there was leeway to raise taxes, would you really choose to spend the extra money on giving better-off pensioners the same rate as the poorest whether they need it or not, just because means testing is becoming suddenly unfashionable? If social justice is the aim for every extra pound raised in tax, the money would be far better spent on young children, making sure they never end up poor: investing in them is a good long-term pensions policy too. </p> <p>Of course, the long-term solution is not mass means testing. Turner makes it plain that the present system will be unsustainable. Some of his hard choices may happen voluntarily: people are retiring later each year and anti-age discrimination law will make that easier. The state will offer a \u00a330,000 lump-sum to anyone retiring at 70. </p> <p>But what Turner inadvertently reveals again is a grossly unequal society with too many people too poor to save, too poor to own homes, with wages too low and no chance to move up. The pensions crisis is partly a reflection of that. Until lifetime incomes are fairer, there is no avoiding topping up the pensions of the poorest, even if means testing is complex. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<b> John Le Carr\u00e9</b> <br> Maybe there's one good reason - just one - for re-electing George W Bush, and that's to force him to live with the consequences of his appalling actions, and answer for his own lies, rather than wish the job on a Democrat who will then get blamed for his predecessor's follies. <p>Probably no American president in all history has been so universally hated abroad as George W Bush: for his bullying unilateralism, his dismissal of international treaties, his reckless indifference to the aspirations of other nations and cultures, his contempt for institutions of world government, and above all for misusing the cause of anti-terrorism in order to unleash an illegal war - and now anarchy - upon a country that like too many others around the world was suffering under a hideous dictatorship, but had no hand in 9/11, no weapons of mass destruction, and no record of terrorism except as an ally of the US in a dirty war against Iran. </p> <p>Is your president a great war leader because he allowed himself to be manipulated by a handful of deluded ideologues? Is Tony Blair a great war leader because he committed Britain's troops, foreign policy and domestic security to the same hare-brained adventure? </p> <p>You are voting in November. We will vote next year. Yet the outcome in both countries will in large part depend on the same question: how long can the lies last now that the truth has finally been told? The Iraq war was planned long before 9/11. Osama provided the excuse. Iraq paid the price. American kids paid the price. British kids paid the price. Our politicians lied to us. </p> <p>While Bush was waging his father's war at your expense, he was also ruining your country. He made your rich richer and your poor and unemployed more numerous. He robbed your war veterans of their due and reduced your children's access to education. And he deprived more Americans than ever before of healthcare. Now he's busy cooking the books, burying deficits and calling in contingency funds to fight a war that his advisers promised him he could light and put out like a candle. </p> <p>Meanwhile, your Patriot Act has swept aside constitutional and civil liberties which took brave Americans 200 years to secure, and were once the envy of a world that now looks on in horror, not just at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib, but at what you are doing to yourselves. </p> <p>But please don't feel isolated from the Europe you twice saved. Give us back the America we loved, and your friends will be waiting for you. And here in Britain, for as long as we have Tony Blair singing the same lies as George Bush, your nightmares will be ours. </p> <p>\u00a9 David Cornwell 2004<br> <b>\u00b7</b> John Le Carr\u00e9 is a novelist.</p> <p><b> Antonia Fraser</b><br> O duty </p> <p>Why hast thou not the visage of a sweetie or a cutie ... ? </p> <p>Why art thou so different from Venus? </p> <p>And why do thou and I have so few interests in common between us? </p> <p>These sentiments on the subject of duty, so brilliantly expressed by Ogden Nash, may well be yours, dear Unknown, when I, a national of another country, urge you to do your duty and vote in your coming presidential election. In fact, of course, we have all too many interests in common. When you vote - and please do vote by the way, even if you disagree with everything I am about to say - that vote will have as much effect on my future and the much longer future of my children and grandchildren, as it will on your own. For this is a crucial election, the most crucial, I believe, of my lifetime (and I first voted in 1955!). </p> <p>First of all, if you back Kerry, you will be voting against a savage militaristic foreign policy of pre-emptive killing which has stained the great name of the US so hideously in recent times. A policy that Bush and his gang are set to continue - if they get the opportunity. I say \"the great name\" of the US because I believe that to be profoundly true. Although resolutely against the Iraq war, I remain equally resolutely philamerican, almost every movement towards liberty in the past having its roots or its refuge in the US. </p> <p>As a wartime child, I am well aware of the benevolence of the American soldiers who came to our aid, the ones that filled the foreign graveyards where they lay, fallen because they had joined our war. Brought up in Oxford, I regarded these men as gods, generous gods. I shall never forget Hank, a composite of the very young American soldiers who regularly got my brother Thomas and me into the Ritz cinema to see movies such as Saboteur. In fact, Hank, in retrospect, looked rather like the Great Tom, my cinematic hero in Saving Private Ryan (so maybe Tom is Hank's boy; I like to think so). From the image of Hank to that of Abu Ghraib ... </p> <p>Then there is the question of women's rights, and the possible repeal of legislation that has for a generation made all women equal before the law, not just the rich. Once again, this history of women's rights in America is long, strong and wonderful. As long ago as 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville, visiting America from France, discovered \"the singular address and happy boldness\" of its women, featured in Democracy in America. If you vote for Kerry, you will help to avert a move backwards towards women's suffering. </p> <p>President Bush declared on Friday that, \"History will decide\". Dear Unknown, please be part of that history and restore your country to its greatness, both foreign and domestic. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Antonia Fraser is a biographer and historian. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Richard Dawkins</b><br> Dear Americans, </p> <p>Don't be so ashamed of your president: the majority of you didn't vote for him. If Bush is finally elected properly, that will be the time for Americans travelling abroad to simulate a Canadian accent. Please don't let it come to that. Vote against Bin Laden's dream candidate. Vote to send Bush packing. </p> <p>Before 9/11 gave him his big break - the neo-cons' Pearl Harbor - Bush was written off as an amiable idiot, certain to serve only one term. An idiot he may be, but he is also sly, mendacious and vindictive; and the thuggish ideologues who surround him are dangerous. 9/11 gave America a free gift of goodwill, and it poured in from all around the world. Bush took it as a free gift to the warmongers of his party, a licence to attack an irrelevant country which, however nasty its dictator, had no connection with 9/11. The consequence is that all the worldwide goodwill has vanished. Bush's America is on the way to becoming a pariah state. And Bush's Iraq has become a beacon for terrorists. </p> <p>In the service of his long-planned war (with its catastrophically unplanned aftermath), Bush not only lied about Iraq being the \"enemy\" who had attacked the twin towers. With the connivance of the toadying Tony Blair and the spineless Colin Powell, he lied to Congress and the world about weapons of mass destruction. He is now brazenly lying to the American electorate about how \"well\" things are going under the puppet government. By comparison with this cynical mendacity, the worst that can be said about John Kerry is that he sometimes changes his mind. Well, wouldn't you change your mind if you discovered that the major premise on which you had been persuaded to vote for war was a big fat lie? </p> <p>Now that all other justifications for the war are known to be lies, the warmongers are thrown back on one, endlessly repeated: the world is a better place without Saddam. No doubt it is. But that's the Tony Martin school of foreign policy [Martin was a householder who shot dead a burglar who had broken into his house in 1999]. It's not how civilised countries, who follow the rule of law, behave. The world would be a better place without George Bush, but that doesn't justify an assassination attempt. The proper way to get rid of that smirking gunslinger is to vote him out. </p> <p>As the bumper stickers put it, \"Re-defeat Bush\". But, this time, do it so overwhelmingly that neither his brother's friends in Florida nor his father's friends on the Supreme Court will be able to rig the count. Decent Americans - there are absolutely more intelligent, educated, civilised, cultivated, compassionate people in America than in any other country in the western world - please show your electoral muscle this time around. We in the rest of the world, who sadly cannot vote in the one election that really affects our future, are depending on you.

  "Lord Whitty, who proposed the second reading of the hunting bill in the Lords, began with a long, loud sigh, rather like Mr Bennet hearing another of his daughters knock on his study door in search of cash for a new dress. <p>Everyone was familiar with the bill, he said - why, it was exactly the same as the one they had pondered last year. </p> <p>Was there any real need to consider it all again? The Commons had voted seven times, by huge majorities, for a ban on hunting. Can't we all, his body language, indeed his actual vocabulary, seemed to say, pack it in and go home? </p> <p>Fat chance. The Lords regard this bill as slightly less important than, say, female emancipation, but rather more important than the abolition of the slave trade. They believe they are not talking about a few dozen furry animals, but the eternal flame of human liberty. </p> <p>As Baroness Mallalieu, a Labour peer and herself a huntsperson, put it: \"The stench of this bill, if it ever becomes law, will pollute the record of this government.\" </p> <p>What? More than the 45-minute claim, which only a few hours before Jack Straw had been obliged to disown in the Commons, laying it fastidiously to one side, as one might dispose of a smelly old fox fur discovered in the attic of a recently deceased aunt. More than that? </p> <p>Baroness Byford, who kicked off for the Tories, warmed up on the pitch with a few observations about \"this ancient parliament\", always a sign that we're going to get some gorgeous, hand-stitched march of time-type tapestry. \"They have abandoned the principle of concern for minorities; they are crushing civil liberties.\" </p> <p>She asked who could doubt that horse racing would be banned next. Up to a point, I thought. Horse racing doesn't yet end up with the horse being torn to shreds by dogs. On the other hand, horses don't overturn your dustbins. </p> <p>The Bishop of Chelmsford, if I understood him correctly, thought you couldn't go round banning things just because you didn't like them. You might as well ban adultery, gambling and tobacco. </p> <p>Each to his own. But it sounds as if a weekend in the bishop's palace at Chelmsford might be fun. </p> <p>Lord Mancroft was very cross indeed. He denounced Sir Gerald Kaufman for calling the hunt protesters \"racist, larcenous scum\", adding, \"if that sort of language were used about any other minority - gay people, black people or, God forbid, Jewish people ...\" He somehow forgot to mention that Sir Gerald was describing an event when hunt protesters had thrown anti-semitic abuse at him, while one of them tried to steal his wallet. </p> <p>Lord Mancroft accused the government of \"behaving like a fascist dictatorship\". The hyperbole in that line seems to me to imply a certain anti-semitism, but no doubt unconscious. </p> <p>David Steel made one of the more reasonable pro-hunting speeches, arguing that John Prescott had demonstrated that the bill wasn't really meant to abolish hunting, but to abolish toffs. </p> <p>\"A bill to abolish toffs might seem to have a rationale, unlike this bill,\" he said. Of course. Ministers have been trying and failing to abolish toffs for years. </p> <p>One of the most thoughtful contributions came from Lord Burns, whose report on hunting declared that it \"seriously compromised the welfare of the fox\". As any fox will tell you. </p> <p>Basically he told the peers that they had made a huge tactical error by not accepting a compromise earlier, and now they were going to pay with a complete ban on hunting. You could almost hear the chill run round the chamber.</p>",

  "Equipment which could be used in an illicit nuclear bomb programme has disappeared from previously monitored sites in Iraq, and radioactively contaminated items from there have been found abroad, the International Atomic Energy Agency has told the UN. <p>Installations in Saddam Hussein's former nuclear bomb programme were being systematically dismantled, its director general, Mohamed ElBaradei, has told the security council, warning of the implications for trafficking. </p> <p>In a letter to Sir Emyr Jones Parry, the British diplomat presiding over the security council, Dr ElBaradei said his inspectors had \"been able to identify quantities of industrial items, some radioactively contaminated, that had been transferred out of Iraq from sites [previously] monitored by the IAEA\". </p> <p>These did not not include \"high precision equipment\" with a dual civilian or military use which would be valuable in a nuclear bomb programme. But he added: \"The disappearance of such equipment and materials may be of proliferation significance.\" </p> <p>The warning will further embarrass the US and British governments, which justified the war in Iraq with the alleged threat of weapons of mass destruction, insisting that Saddam Hussein had an active nuclear bomb programme. </p> <p>Dr ElBaradei appealed for information about any of the vanished equipment. Last night the Iraqi science and technology minister, Rashad Omar, invited the UN nuclear inspectors to return to Iraq to check on the missing equipment and materials. </p> <p>\"The locations that belong to the science and technology ministry are secure and under our control,\" Mr Omar told Reuters. He said that Tuwaitha, the vast compound south of Baghdad which contained Iraq's main nuclear facility, was being turned into a science park. \"The IAEA came back one month ago, it inspected the plant and other ones and didn't say anything. </p> <p>\"We are transparent. We are happy for the IAEA or any other organisation to come and inspect,\" he said, adding that he had not seen the agency's report to the security council. </p> <p>The run-up to the war in Iraq last year was marked by intense hostility between the Bush administration and the weapons inspectors, with Washington and London scorning the inspections, which are now known to have successfully dismantled Saddam Hussein's secret bomb programme in the mid-90s. </p> <p>The inspectors have been virtually barred from Iraq by the US since before the war and Dr ElBaradei's information on the missing equipment has come from satellite photography and other sources. </p> <p>Some of the contaminated equipment and material from Iraq is believed to have been located in Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and the Netherlands. </p> <p>Iran is widely suspected of conducting a clandestine bomb project and might be keen to obtain some of the sophisticated engineering equipment on the loose in Iraq. </p> <p>The past nine months have also seen revelations about an extensive international network of nuclear smugglers, centred in Pakistan, supplying contraband equipment to at least three countries. </p> <p>\"The invasion of Iraq was supposed to be about stopping weapons of mass destruction. It was supposed to be about stopping nuclear materials from getting out from under UN control,\" Greenpeace said yesterday. \"The only winners in this story are those who are looking to capitalise on security failures by scoring loose nukes.\" </p> <p>Greenpeace raised the alarm about nuclear chaos in Iraq last year after visiting the Tuwaitha complex. </p> <p>In June, just before the US handed authority in Iraq to the interim government, the US forces secretly flew almost two tonnes of uranium and associated equipment from Iraq to the US, causing a diplomatic row with the IAEA, which is mandated to monitor and verify the nuclear complexes and stockpiles. </p> <p>The IAEA, Dr ElBaradei said, \"continues to be concerned about the widespread and apparently systematic dismantlement that has taken place at sites previously relevant to Iraq's nuclear programme\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Saddam Hussein underwent an operation to repair a hernia about 10 days ago but has made a full recovery, Iraqi sources said yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>The government last night appointed one of its favourite troubleshooters, Adrian Montague, to chair Crossrail and pledged to introduce a bill to construct the \u00a310bn railway across London during the next parliamentary session. </p> <p>Mr Montague, who is chairman of British Energy, will head a seven-strong board that has been restructured to put a check on the influence of the mayor of London, Ken Livingstone. He replaces Crossrail's existing chairman, Sir Christopher Benson. </p> <p>In a statement confirming Mr Montague's appointment, the Department for Transport said that it expected to introduce a hybrid bill to build the east-west line by the end of March. </p> <p>The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, said: \"We want to introduce a Crossrail hybrid bill at the earliest possible opportunity. The new chairman will have decisive new powers to move the project forward.\" </p> <p>The announcement is likely to delight London's business community, which has been lobbying furiously for the line. It is intended to run from Heathrow through the City to the capital's eastern fringes. It will increase London's rail capacity by a fifth and is intended to relieve chronic congestion on existing lines. </p> <p>Mr Montague previously headed the Treasury's Private Finance Initiative taskforce. He is deputy chairman of the government-backed infrastructure company Network Rail, which he will now quit. He was commissioned last year by Mr Darling to compile a feasibility study on Crossrail. </p> <p>Crossrail has already received \u00a3150m of public funding. The total cost is expected to be split, with London's businesses called upon to contribute at least \u00a32.5bn through higher local taxation. </p> <p>Mr Livingstone has urged the government to give him responsibility for managing Crossrail's construction. </p> <p>Under the new structure, three of Crossrail's seven directors will be from his Transport for London authority: Bob Kiley, Jay Walder and Ian Brown. </p> <p>However, Mr Livingstone's nominees could be outvoted if Mr Montague uses his casting vote. </p> <p>The other three directors will be a senior Department for Transport official, Mike Fuhr; a former Bechtel construction executive, John Carter, and a former engineer with the Mott Macdonald Group, Tim Thirlwall.</p>",
  "The former top civil servant who headed the government's inquiry into foxhunting yesterday suggested in the Lords that it would be a misuse of the Parliament Act to push through a hunting ban. <p>Lord Burns, former permanent secretary to the Treasury, said he would find it \"very difficult\" to accept use of the act when there was no clear scientific evidence supporting a ban. </p> <p>The act, which has been used just three times since 1949, is supposed to be used for bills which are urgent government business or which deliver manifesto pledges. Labour argues a hunting ban was a manifesto pledge, but critics say they only pledged to let Parliament resolve the issue. </p> <p>Lord Burns added that a ban would not pass the government's own test that the law be \"soundly based and stand the test of time.\" </p> <p>The crossbench peer, whose 2000 investigation suggested hunting \"seriously compromises the welfare of the fox\", said: \"Although I fully understand the frustrations of those who favour a ban and feel the issue has been debated long enough, I find it very difficult to accept the use of the Parliament Act in circumstances where there is no clear scientific support of the animal welfare implications of a ban. </p> <p>\"I feel it can only be divisive in the country at large, as well as being inconsistent with the use of that procedure. For myself personally it would be an enormously disappointing end to the attempt to find some common ground on this issue\". </p> <p>Lord Burns's comments came after the environment minister, Lord Whitty, made clear that peers were in \"the last chance saloon\" over the bill and they had little choice but to accept it. </p> <p>Peers have been edging toward sending back an amended bill calling for a regulated form of hunting, but the minister suggested he would have no truck with this. </p> <p>For the Tories, who hope to embarrass the prime minister by sending back the bill in the form he favours, the environment spokeswoman Lady Byford said sending back the amended bill would test whether government \"talk on compromise is genuine\".</p>",
  "The deadliest affliction known to British politics, the Curse of Letwin, struck again yesterday, inadvertently demolishing Michael Howard's claim that crime is out of control in Brixton because there are no police to be found on its streets at night. <p>Twenty-four hours after the Conservative leader used a Guardian article to attack the police record in the south London area - and columnist Polly Toynbee - for challenging his party conference thesis, internet researchers unearthed laudatory praise of the \"Brixton miracle.\" </p> <p>It came from the lips of Oliver Letwin. But he could not be accused of stabbing Mr Howard in the back. He stabbed him in the front - in two public speeches. </p> <p>Admittedly, the shadow chancellor was shadow home secretary at the time and the past year in Tory politics has been a very long one. But at last year's Conservative conference in Blackpool Mr Letwin said he had visited Brixton, but found it to be an outstanding example of neighbourhood policing. </p> <p>\"I saw Inspector Sean Wilson and his team reclaiming the streets for local people. Burglary is down, robbery is down, graffiti is wiped away, abandoned cars towed away. Central Brixton is a safer, happier place than it was a couple of years ago,\" he reported, having made similar claims in a speech in June. </p> <p>To compound future embarrassment to his party leader, Mr Letwin went on to say that it was \"bobbies on the beat\" - the ones Mr Howard told this year's conference he hadn't seen - that had made the difference in Brixton. </p> <p>When the Guardian pointed out to Mr Howard that his claims had infuriated the borough police commander and local residents because crime had fallen, not risen, the Tory leader retaliated. </p> <p>\"They've howled in protest at my comments and demanded an apology. But no-one has contradicted what I said. I spoke the truth,\" he wrote in yesterday's paper.</p>",
  "Apparently I'm supposed to be delighted at the news. Why, even as I write, decent Labour ministers are on their feet championing gay rights as the House of Commons debates the civil partnership bill. I do hope you will forgive me for not bedecking myself in bunting. <p>About three years ago I asked a member of the Labour NEC why the government, with its huge majority, was taking so long to get rid of the iniquitous section 28. The white, middle-aged, middle-class man said: \"You have to understand Sandi, we're all middle-aged, white, middle-class men and actually we don't give a damn about gay rights.\" </p> <p>The man shall remain nameless for he told the truth and it is such a rare modus operandi these days that I wouldn't want to get him hounded out of the party. </p> <p>I'm afraid I believe him and even now doubt the bill will become law. The Lords have done their best to wreck it and this parliamentary session is running out of time. </p> <p>My ex-partner and I have three children who we co-parent. Despite our separation we raise the children together and I support her financially, emotionally and with a rather fine line in Latin homework. I do this because I want to and it is the right thing to do. I receive no tax benefit for this and, should I die in an unexpected dry cleaning accident, my co-parent would be unable to inherit from me as a matter of course. </p> <p>I believe that I have a financial duty to children whom I helped bring into the world but opponents of the bill seem obsessed only with any rights that I might gain and not the responsibilities. </p> <p>The fact that there would be a duty to provide reasonable maintenance for your civil partner and children of the family, or that civil partners would be assessed in the same way as spouses for child support seems to have passed many by. </p> <p>I believe at heart the British people are kind. I cannot believe that anyone would wish to perpetuate the kind of sexual apartheid that can prevent a lifelong partner from recognition under intestacy rules, that can deny access to fatal accidents compensation or, as happened to a friend of mine, deny next of kin status to the extent that they are banished from their partner's funeral by blood relations. </p> <p>If the government had truly cared, the legislation would have started in the Commons and the Parliament Act could have been used to push the law through. Sadly it is a way of doing business which is reserved for foxes and not human beings.</p>",
  "The government yesterday moved to rescue its civil partnership bill from unworkable \"wrecking\" amendments in the Lords while reassuring traditionally minded Tory MPs that its plans for legally binding same-sex relationships do not amount to gay marriage. <p>As the Commons voted overwhelmingly to give the bill a second reading, the equality minister, Jacqui Smith, told MPs that the bill was the latest step in a long journey which began when homosexual conduct was decriminalised in the 1960s. </p> <p>\"Today's bill will ensure equality for the thousands of couples whose relationships are currently invisible in the eyes of the law, send out a clear message about the importance of stable and committed same-sex relationships, and mark a major step in helping such couples gain greater social acceptance of their partnership,\" she said. </p> <p>The legislation allows same-sex couples to register as civil partners and thereby acquire legal rights and responsibilities. </p> <p>These include recognition under intestacy and immigration rules, the duty to provide maintenance for a civil partner and any children, and joint treatment for state benefits. </p> <p>If passed, the legislation will come into effect towards the end of next year. </p> <p>Yesterday this came a step closer when the Conservatives joined the government in moving to overturn an amendment passed in the Lords by a cross-party coalition of peers and bishops. </p> <p>Although some peers denied \"wrecking\" intent, the amendment would create \"a myriad of legal absurdities\", the minister told MPs yesterday - and would have to be overturned before the bill became law. </p> <p>It altered the bill by extending its provisions to give rights to long-term carers and family members, such as elderly spinsters living together. </p> <p>This would allow them to qualify for tax and pension benefits - not least to avoid having to sell a jointly owned house to pay a dead partner's inheritance tax. To achieve it they would have to be over 30 and have cohabited for 12 years. </p> <p>Lawyers and citizen's advice bodies had rejected the peers' move, the minister added. \"But worst of all they stand condemned by the very people they were purporting to help: carers. Carers UK believe that they may even harm the position of carers and create new problems,\" she said. </p> <p>Ms Smith said that eight EU states and several other countries had adopted civil partnership since Denmark in 1989. </p> <p>She also signalled a willingness to examine whether the government could afford to accept a more constructive Lords amendment to extend \"survivors' benefits\". </p> <p>It would allow partners to acquire pension rights built up before the partnership registration - as with heterosexual marriage - and is advanced by gay and other groups on the grounds of basic equality. </p> <p>A small group of rightwing Conservative MPs - including Ann Widdecombe, Edward Leigh and Gerald Howarth - dissociated themselves from frontbench support for the measure. </p> <p>Mr Duncan insisted that civil registration would be devoid of any religious connotation and thus separate but parallel to marriage. But he admitted that \"the lines get closer\" when the new partnerships are compared to civil marriages.</p>",
  "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president-designate of the European commission, has a crisis on his hands. The former Portuguese prime minister won plaudits in the summer for picking his Brussels team without bending to the will of powerful EU governments. But controversy over one of his key appointments, Italy's Rocco Buttiglione, is threatening to overshadow the start of his term next month. The problem is simple: Mr Buttiglione, nominated by Silvio Berlusconi, has said publicly that he believes homosexuality is a sin and that the purpose of the family is to allow a woman to have children and to be protected by her husband. <p>Since Mr Buttiglione has been chosen as commissioner for justice, freedom and liberty, it hardly surprising that he has been rejected by the European parliament's civil liberties committee. Parliament, disliked by governments almost as much as it is by ordinary people, has no formal power to reject individual commissioners and may only approve or reject the entire 25-member body. Conventional wisdom is that the Strasbourg assembly is unlikely to use that last resort. Mr Barroso, meeting Tony Blair yesterday, insisted that he had faith in this \"very able\" appointee, and urged toleration of his views - though many will condemn them as quite simply homophobic. </p> <p>Mr Buttiglione, a Christian Democrat with a reputation as a bruiser, is entitled to follow whatever definition of personal morality he chooses. But it becomes a matter of public interest when he says he would not support legislation that ran counter to that morality. That would surely include proposals to combat discrimination on grounds of gender and sexual orientation - an area where legislation initiated by the commission can give a socially progressive lead across the continent. As Italy's European affairs minister Mr Buttiglione fought hard to remove such safeguards from the draft EU constitution. And, like David Blunkett in this country, he has also spoken of Europe being \"swamped\" by immigrants - the red-hot issue at the centre of this highly sensitive portfolio. </p> <p>Britons are less interested than almost all other Europeans in what happens in Brussels. But it was heartening when the hearings about Peter Mandelson's appointment as EU trade commissioner focused on his plans for the job, not his past as a New Labour spinmeister. Mr Barroso's choices matter to all of us. Mr Buttiglione should not be required, as he he put it, to \"prostitute his conscience\". But nor should he take up this important post when his views run counter to those of millions of European citizens.</p>",
  "<p>Like an adolescent in short trousers, social enterprise has shot up with almost unseemly speed. Less than 10 years ago, few of these hybrid social businesses existed - the Big Issue and Caf\u00e9 Direct were among the first to achieve public consciousness. Today, though their numbers remain small when compared with mainstream business, no one is in any doubt that social enterprises are here to stay. Hundreds are now in operation, ranging from energy and waste recycling firms such as McSense and the ECT Group which manages 5% of the UK's green box schemes, to Loch Fyne Oysters and the Eden Project, to social care providers such as Community Foster Carers. They have attracted attention from an array of sources, from Jeff Skoll, the billionaire founding president of eBay, to the chancellor, Gordon Brown. They have been written into government public services strategies and are even set to have their own legal form - the Community Interest Company. </p> <p>But despite all the activity, there is still a need for a clearer, bolder vision. Social enterprise is more than a delivery mechanism for public services or a better way of exercising charity. It contains a new way of life, a new way of organising our society and economy. </p> <p>At its heart, social enterprise is about people taking control over the world around them - an entrepreneurial democracy that draws on wider pools of talent, that builds more inclusive institutions that strike fair deals with employees and consumers and sustain the environment. This promise, however, remains only partially realised. The big question is what can be done to accelerate its growth from promising adolescent to mature adulthood. </p> <p>I would highlight four priorities. First, we must continue building a practical infrastructure for social enterprises: we need more finance; better support networks; more learning - for public service commissioners and other enablers as well as practitioners; and a stronger voice through the Social Enterprise Coalition. </p> <p>Second, we need to attract more and different people to social entrepreneurship. The School for Social Entrepreneurs shows that the socially excluded can lead change. The Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship and other business schools can pull in talent from the private sector. Nurse entrepreneurs are forming learning sets and City Academies are unleashing headteachers' better instincts. </p> <p>Third, we need to build demand for a larger number and wider spread of social ventures. Health service organisations, for example, could do much more to grow social enterprises. Imagine the impact of these huge employers using their resources to invest in health and the local economy by building into their supply chain high levels of local ownership and self-help, rather than relying solely on traditional professionally dominated organisations or plcs. We know that self-determination and greater economic equality underpin good health - this approach could embody both and can reduce pressures on services. </p> <p>Fourth, we need a sharper, more ambitious political narrative. This is not easy since social enterprise does not fall neatly into the policy tick boxes, though it could be instrumental in achieving multiple goals, from work-life balance to cohesive neighbourhoods and revitalised rural life. </p> <p>Our vision should be an economy in which people can use social enterprise in every area of life, from the milk they drink to the bus they use to get to work, to the clothes they wear and the houses they enjoy. </p> <p>This is a radical vision of a very different kind of economy, of a Britain that is no longer content to be solely a nation of shopkeepers. But it is a vision that chimes with many of the values that are growing most strongly in contemporary Britain. </p> <p>The case for new forms of welfare, and ones that reduce inequalities, is increasingly well understood. The needs of the poor, current and future, are felt by all if they are not anticipated and addressed. The rate of change of consumer preferences is speeding up, too. For example, a recent Mori poll showed that 65% of adults are interested in investing their money in a socially responsible way. This figure rises to a staggering 74% among under 35s. </p> <p>Studies such as Shoshanna Zuboff and Jim Maxmin's The Support Economy document further impetus for change. They show how younger employees have a growing concern for the social and environmental impacts of the business they work for. They want to work in companies that practise the respect and equity they preach through their corporate social responsibility policies. They want greater autonomy, more recognition for their contributions, and fewer hours at work so they still have time and energy for a personal life. </p> <p>All these trends are beginning to converge around the new forms of social enterprise. The question that remains is whether the political parties will be smart enough to understand just how big a change is under way, and just how quickly this small baby has grown up. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Rowena Young is director of the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship at the Sa\u00efd Business School, Oxford University.

  "<p>Centrepoint was established 35 years ago as emergency shelter for homeless young people in London's West End. A few months later, and some 200 miles north, a young John Prescott was elected MP for Kingston-upon-Hull.</p> <p>Since then, the charity has grown, and now has a national reputation in policy-making and campaigns for homeless young people.</p> <p>Today deputy prime minister Prescott is responsible for housing and tackling homelessness. He's the first to admit there is still much to be done, but he can point to much progress in the past seven years.</p> <p>Housing, homelessness and social exclusion has not always been at the top of the political agenda. It wasn't until 1977, under Jim Callaghan's Labour government, that local housing authorities were given a duty to help homeless people. Families with children, single people made homeless through an emergency, and vulnerable groups were given priority by housing departments.</p> <p>Twenty years later, the then Conservative government introduced legislation so that councils had a duty only to accommodate homeless people for two years. In addition, homeless people were removed from the list of groups given preference for social housing. This was reversed when Labour returned to power in 1997 with social exclusion high on its reform agenda. Labour restored preference for homeless households for social housing and launched a capital receipts initiative to boost investment in housing, which had been halved between 1992 and 1997.</p> <p>It took a further five years and a second term of office before Labour introduced the 2002 Homelessness Act. Councils must now secure long-term accommodation for homeless households.</p> <p>They are required to compile a five-year strategy for preventing and tackling homelessness in their area, while regulations have extended the groups judged to be in priority need - now including young people leaving care and 16- and 17-year-olds.</p> <p>The act also made it compulsory for councils to conduct a review of all forms of homelessness to inform their strategies. Alongside this stronger legislation, Labour set a target to end the long-term use of B&amp;B hotels for homeless families with children, and set up a directorate to help develop new, preventive approaches.</p> <p>In his keynote speech to the Labour party conference this year, Prescott said that Britain's housing crisis would be one of his party's general election priorities. And a recent report from the government's Social Exclusion Unit identified homelessness as one of the \"remaining\" challenges that Labour intends to address. It said: \"We need to give renewed attention to these areas as a matter of priority.\"</p> <p>This special supplement is intended to take stock of youth homelessness in the context of the wider battle against social exclusion. We begin by asking Prescott himself how he sees the picture and what he proposes to do.</p>",
  "Michelle was 12 when she began clubbing. \"It all started when I was in foster care, and then moving from care home to care home,\" she says, now aged 16. \"Some of the girls I knew were teenagers and they were going to parties, so I went too. I was the youngest. We drank huge amounts of alcohol. <p>\"I'd always wanted to be a model from a very young age,\" she adds, \"so I arranged for a portfolio to be done. But I had to go topless and the model agency manager asked whether he could put it on the internet. The care home manager knew that I was going to get the portfolio done, but when I told him what had happened the police got involved and the agency was closed down.\" </p> <p>Michelle's social worker arranged for her to contact a project for girls and young women at risk of sexual exploitation and abuse through prostitution. Michelle is one of more than 200 children and young people seen in the past four years by the Merseyside scheme, run by children's charity Barnardo's. </p> <p>\"At first I didn't appreciate what they were doing, but now I do. They've been really, really helpful. I'm well out of that situation,\" says Michelle. </p> <p>The team of four full-timers has until now worked only with young women referred by agencies, but manager Jaci Quennell recognises that there are young people of both sexes out there who may need help but would never contact social services. As a result, the scheme has launched a freephone number that boys as well as girls can use. </p> <p>About 5,000 children are believed to be involved in prostitution. The Children's Society is calling on the government to fund schemes like Barnardo's Merseyside as part of its overhaul of prostitution laws. Each of Barnardo's 14 similar schemes in England and Wales struggle for funds. </p> <p>\"It's about time that central government and local statutory bodies provided proper funding,\" argues the society's policy officer, Andy McCullough. \"It's crucial that this is taken on board in the Home Office's current review of prostitution.\" </p> <p>The Barnardo's team provides one-to-one support and group sessions, focusing in particular on self-esteem. It's very important, says Quennell, to help the youngsters appreciate that having fun does not have to involve drugs and alcohol, or the so-called \"treats\" used by their exploiters and abusers to keep them in line. </p> <p>\"We go through a 14-point risk assessment with them,\" says Quennell. \"Each point is denoted by a colour - red, amber, green - with red being the most risky. This makes everything very clear. Also, we can't make any assumptions about the children's literacy skills. We repeat this at three months, six months and so on. We've found that it's an effective way of helping them to see for themselves the risks they're running and to gauge what progress they're making.\" </p> <p>New partnerships are being forged - with staff at the Royal Liverpool hospital's casualty department, which can refer young people if concerns arise; with Wirral social services, which runs a project for children who run away; with Sefton social services; and with primary healthcare staff and the police. </p> <p>But project worker Gill Buck admits it can be a struggle to get all the statutory agencies involved to work with them in a coordinated way. The same is true of agencies working with asylum seekers and unaccompanied young people, she says, many of whom are at risk of sexual exploitation.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> For details of the Barnardo's Merseyside scheme, contact <a href=\"mailto:jaci.quennell@barnardos.org.uk\">jaci.quennell@barnardos.org.uk</a> To participate in the consultation on prostitution law, email <a href=\"mailto:prostitutionreview@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk\">prostitutionreview@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk</a> Closing date: November 26.</p>",
  "<p>Recent years have seen escalating water bills in Britain, increased flood risks and alarming depletion of wetland wildlife such as lapwing and snipe - birds that were once a familiar part of the everyday landscape. Many plants, too, that depend onunpolluted waters are disappearing from the UK's lakes, ponds and ditches, while the insect life that feeds fish in our marvellous chalk rivers is on the decline. </p> <p>Yet, for the past decade, there have been good news stories from government about the quality of our rivers. Its general quality assessment (GQA) for rivers, published last week, said that more than 95% of our rivers were in \"good or fair condition\". </p> <p>How then is there such a mismatch? The GQA does tell a true story about how pollution problems have been tackled in the past, but reveals only a tiny part of the picture. It shows that pollution from some dangerous chemicals and raw sewage has been reduced dramatically - there once were no fish in big rivers such as the Thames and Britain's beaches were littered with sewer debris. But the figures also hide chronic and insidious problems, such as the cumulative impact of fertilisers, sheep dip and pesticides, and the effects of water abstraction to meet the growing demand for water for domestic use. The figures also fail to take account of the physical damage done to rivers and coasts through drainage, development and river engineering. </p> <p>All of this means that, at present, a river that is too damaged to support characteristic plants and animals, and that may not be safe to swim in, could be classed under the GQA system as \"good or fair\". The government has said this system will change - as required by the EU's water framework directive (WFD), which looks at the bigger picture: judging the condition of waters, quite literally, on their ability to support life. </p> <p>Last month, the Environment Agency released its first WFD risk assessment, a \"stocktake\" of the state of Britain's waters. It revealed that most rivers, lakes, coasts and groundwater sites were at risk of failing to meet these new requirements. </p> <p>The challenge ahead is to put this right, to tackle new problems with new solutions. It is no longer solely about preventing raw sewage reaching rivers and beaches, though this is important. It is also about protecting and restoring urban rivers, by putting some green space back around them - space that might also hold water that would otherwise flood towns and cities. </p> <p>It means reducing the amount of fertilisers and pesticides getting into our water from farmland, so that we no longer have to pay the \u00a3120m a year it costs to take those pesticides out of drinking water. And it is about finding more space in the countryside for water to move around, restoring the old, sinuous paths of our rivers and reconnecting them to their wetlands, so that mayflies, trout, kingfishers and lapwings have new places to live, and floodwater is held up before it reaches vulnerable houses. </p> <p>But how much will this cost and who will pay for it? It won't come for free, but modest investment now will reap huge dividends in the future - both financial and environmental. </p> <p>For example, the judicious use of some of the money Britain receives from Brussels for farmers could help to create new wetlands in the countryside, to hold back floods and support wildlife. Investment in agricultural businesses that use fewer pesticides and fertilisers will give us better water that costs less to treat. Building homes that use less water will ease the burden of abstraction on our rivers, and reduce the future cost of building new reservoirs and the miles of pipes needed to service them. </p> <p>While the UK is waking up to the truth about water, we don't yet know whether this will translate itself into new ways of using this most precious natural resource. If it is done right, the rewards will be massive: drinking water so good that it makes the bottled stuff redundant; wetland wildlife to delight in; more confidence in our ability to withstand future floods and droughts; and lower water bills. </p> <p>But this will require work, and the imagination to use our current resources - whether they come from Brussels or Westminster - in a more thoughtful way. Let's hope this is one EU law government feels happy to own - and that it is not known as the \"British directive\" for nothing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sarah Oppenheimer is a water policy officer at the RSPB.</p>",

The government made a serious misjudgment when it introduced public ownership of the car plants [local representation on the boards of foundation hospitals], when it should have been giving more local control of PCTs.\" </p> <p>Moreover, the wrong sort of people run the trusts. More than 90% of PCT chairs had been on the boards of other health bodies. It was, says Atkins, \"like trying to build a new machine with old tools\". </p> <p>She is, naturally, positive about the calibre of managers and staff in her own PCT, claiming they are the best in the business. But across the NHS she observes a tolerance of mediocre management that would not be accepted in the private sector. </p> <p>This slackness is exacerbated by the blame culture of the NHS. \"It makes people totally risk averse. They think it is better to do nothing than to do something that may not work. And - just as bad - you can't celebrate success. If you say, as I do, that you are proud to chair this organisation - it rocks, the staff are fantastic - then people just want to shoot you. They don't think, as they would in business, 'how do we get to be like that?; how do we pinch those good ideas?' They think, 'we can't wait for her to fail.' </p> <p>\"One of the big problems for chairs - and to a lesser extent the non-execs on trust boards - is that they have been around too long. They have forgotten it is a non-executive position. For me, the worst that could happen if I was fired tomorrow is that I'd go out and earn more money. As a chairwoman in the NHS, I earn a tenth of what I would in my executive life. So I lose nothing by being true to the principles of the NHS and the people of Portsmouth.\" </p> <p>So far, Atkins does not appear to have paid a price for this outspokenness. Plenty of chairs would tremble at the mention of Sir William Wells, the chairman of the NHS appointments commission, which hires and fires the trust non-execs. Atkins merely recalls how unusual it was that he picked at his fingernails throughout her interview for the Portsmouth job. She thought he could not be interested in her and probably became even more forthright to catch his attention. When she asked later why he appointed her, Wells replied: \"Well, you weren't boring.\" </p> <p>Perhaps her ability to thrive is assisted by her tallness, glamorous appearance and imposing demeanour. She has a tendency to pause and think for a while in silence about a question before answering it, suggesting that she is a listener as well as a talker. She is committed, she says, to a devolved NHS , partly from the experience of her aunt Vera, who died four years ago at 92 after being infected in hospital. Her aunt had gone in with a skin infection and would probably have lived much longer had she been treated in primary care. </p> <p>Vera Atkins was the driving force at the Special Operations Executive during the second world war, running covert operations in France. She was believed to have been the inspiration for the Miss Moneypenny character in Ian Fleming's James Bond books. \"She was as sharp as a button before she went into hospital,\" recalls her niece. \"We have to be able to do better for people who deserve so much.\" </p> <p>A month after Vera's death, Atkins decided to get involved in the NHS. The health service's financial illiteracy was an early shock. The NHS, she found, ran its finances like a game. The tactics involved inflating the budget to make everything as expensive as possible. \"You run to the end of the financial year over budget on everything because that is the way you get more money for the following year. The thinking is that they can't let you go bust. </p> <p>\"This game is crippling the NHS. There is a view that you are letting your local population down if you break even. People say there is not enough money to go round. That's bullshit. There's more than enough. Of course there are always more things you could do. We get \u00a3200m and we could easily spend \u00a3250m. But the job of PCTs is to grasp the nettle of finite resources.\" </p> <p>Portsmouth has stood apart from PCT management mergers elsewhere in Hampshire. It has a good record of balancing its budget. That is not to say it gets everything right. In the last performance ratings there were 44 three-star PCTs in England, and Portsmouth was not one of them. Atkins says its demotion to two stars was reasonable, caused by a faulty IT system that has since been rectified. </p> <p>But she thinks her PCT excels at doing what PCTs were supposed to do - devolving decisions to the clinicians who are in direct contact with the patients. All the city's 26 practices are represented on the trust's professional executive committee. Many are developing specialist services that can keep patients out of hospital. In this context, she holds that the government's decision last week to devolve commissioning budgets to GPs was a step in the right direction. </p> <p>She is less enamoured with Labour's fascination with the private sector - the US corporation United Health in particular, which hopes that PCTs will buy into its programme for identifying vulnerable older people and providing them with intensive home support. The company's manual on how to do this, says Atkins, is \"an algorithm of the bloody obvious\". </p> <p>PCTs were already well placed to provide the service, she sighs. \"Sadly, there are people who would prefer not to have something for free if they can pay the private sector a fortune for it. The muppets [malfunctioning NHS managers] will no doubt [hire] United and it will poach their staff at twice the salary to make the scheme work.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Zenna Atkins will be writing an occasional column for Society Guardian.</p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong> Age</strong> 39 </p> <p><strong> Status</strong> Married, two children </p> <p><strong> Lives</strong> Southsea, Portsmouth </p> <p><strong> Education</strong> Failed her 11 plus; Cornwall college of further education; Richmond Fellowship College (certificate in psychodynamic group therapy) </p> <p><strong> Career</strong> 1985-91: charity project manager; 1991-93: founder and manager of Portsmouth homeless charity; 1993-95: Portsmouth crime prevention officer; 1995-2000: founder and manager of youth justice charities; 1997: guest presenter, Channel 5; 1999-2004: partner, Social Solutions, promoting social entrepreneurialism, 2000: Ernst &amp; Young entrepreneur of the year award - southern region </p> <p><strong> Public life</strong> Chair, Portsmouth City primary care trust; chair, Places for People housing association.</p>",
  "<p>Tuberculosis, a highly infectious disease, was thought to have been all but eliminated from wealthy western societies decades ago thanks to widespread effective immunisation. </p> <p>However, a recent resurgence of the disease in Britain - the number of cases has shot up by a staggering 25% over the past decade - has prompted renewed concern. </p> <p>More than 6,000 people in the UK were diagnosed with TB in 2002 and some 350 people die from the disease each year in England. </p> <p>Last week, the government's chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, announced a new initiative to bring TB back under control. Among the suggestions he made was a commitment to increasing awareness of TB among health professionals, identifying the infection early, and concentrating efforts on high risk groups. </p> <p>This last measure may prove particularly important because the recent rises have been among distinct groups. For example, most cases occur in inner cities and two out of every five incidences are in London. Around seven of every 10 people with TB are from an ethnic minority group and nearly two-thirds of those with the disease were born abroad. </p> <p>But some obstacles remain. Around 6% of patients show resistance to one or more drugs. And, left untreated, a person with infectious TB of the lungs puts between 10 and 15 people a year at risk of contracting the infection.</p>",
  "<p>Dawn Primarolo (paymaster general): The UK currently lies 27th out of 30 OECD countries for participation in education at age 17. Our ambition is to move from being one of the lowest to one of the highest-ranked countries for the training of young people. We know there are innumerable barriers to education and training for those over 16 years. Financial support should not be one of them. The aim of our review is to encourage, support and incentivise people to remain in education and training for as long it takes.</p> <p>Skills are important for life chances, but it is also about the country's flexibility, productivity and competitiveness - all the things that you would expect the Treasury to emphasise.</p> <p>I want to thank Centrepoint for its invaluable support in the review. One of the hallmarks of the consultation is the way that Centrepoint got us to involve young people themselves in the consultation, and those discussions are now shaping the future.</p> <p><strong>Anthony Lawton (chief executive of Centrepoint):</strong> It's really important to enable young people to make choices about how to learn, grow, live their lives, and become independent in ways that are not driven by particular sets of administrative rules and definitions.</p> <p>Interestingly, most young people we have talked with want to be able to claim benefits at 16 and not 18. But they also want a system that enables them to remain in appropriate contact with their families. We need to get the balance right so that we are fostering a healthy interdependence for young people.</p> <p><strong>John Ransford (director of education and social policy at the Local Government Association):</strong> We've got to start by responding to people's needs, rather than defining the problem in organisational terms. There's a real tension between the coordination of activity that focuses on the needs of the individual and the fragmentation of the organisational structure we've got. When I started in local government, almost all services for young people were part of the local government field. They are all fragmented now. But that has not actually improved the level of support.</p> <p><strong>Pam Hibbert (policy officer at children's charity Barnardo's):</strong> If you talk to young people, that fragmentation is really obvious. The number of places they have to go to tell their story is very concerning. But there are some good examples where those services have been bought together.</p> <p><strong>Tom Wylie (chief executive of the National Youth Agency):</strong> The government's five-year education strategy spoke about an \"integrated youth offer\". We need to ensure this \"offer\" is not just a set of services, but has financial incentives built into it. It is also a matter of the capacity of young people to do things. Too many services are highly client-focused with young people as the beneficiaries. It ought to be balanced with building a sense of agency in the young to take action.</p> <p><strong>Simone Common (divisional manager for young people's services at Sunderland council):</strong> Joint services are important but, for us, the big thing is the benefits system - not just jobseeker's allowance and income support, but also housing benefit. Trying to keep young people in education and able to access housing benefit has caused us massive problems, particularly with supported housing schemes. The remit of the review needs to go wider to include housing benefit.</p> <p><strong>Primarolo:</strong> It is not that we are excluding housing benefit, but we already have a lot to address. We don't want to raise expectations beyond what it is deliverable.</p> <p><strong>Common:</strong> There is still an issue for those young people who are forced into independence, and who can't live at home, but who need support to maintain education.</p> <p><strong>Primarolo:</strong> If we tried to design a system that picked up the most vulnerable at every point where they were exposed, we would have a complex system that sounded all right, but couldn't deliver.</p> <p><strong>Val Derbyshire (Co-operative group)</strong> Young people in education shouldn't be penalised if they want to work. If someone wants to buy a PlayStation, then they should be able to because it's their choice to work in their free time.</p> <p><strong>Hibbert:</strong> A lot of young people are concerned about the prospect of benefit being paid to their parents, because many have fragile relationships with their parents. At the moment, they are getting \u00a340 paid to them. If benefit goes to parents, many of them wouldn't even have any pocket money. So that would remove their incentive to go into training.</p> <p><strong>Hannah Lownsborough (researcher at thinktank Demos):</strong> Some parents are sceptical about the value of training and education. And the signal that we send when our benefits system is confusing and difficult to access is that training is less good than getting a full-time job.</p> <p><strong>Cliff Laws (manager of Derwentside citizen's advice bureau):</strong> I've worked with the benefits systems for 16 years, and over that time, it has got more and more complicated. I've known people with law degrees who have struggled to fill in claims forms. There needs to be a simplification of the system to allow people to understand how to get into it - and out of it - when they choose.</p> <p><strong>Hibbert:</strong> One of the issues for young people released from custody is the access to benefits. Even if they sign on on the day they are released, it can be six weeks before they get any money. So it's perhaps not surprising that they drift back into reoffending.</p> <p><strong>Common:</strong> The big thing for many 16- and 17-year-olds is the proof of estrangement needed before they can receive any support. They are already in a crisis situation; the ability to keep cool when they challenged about their sensitive circumstances at home is very difficult. The different levels of entitlement also don't make sense. It's no cheaper to live independently at 19 than it is at 26, yet benefit rates are different.</p> <p><strong>Primarolo:</strong> We want to get to a position where young people can make choices that are not being driven by incentives in the system. My experience has taught me that if you try doing too much, you end up doing nothing at all. So the trick is to recognise the complexity and start making the strategic changes that lead to a different system in the end. Let's not have too many objectives. Let's start with some, and deliver on them, and then move on. It's a complex piece of work. You've given me lots of things to worry about.</p> <p><strong>Family trauma healed through counselling</strong></p> <p>Watching her parents separate and her brother battle mental health problems was too much for Liza Nicolau, who left home only to spend three years sleeping on friends' sofas.</p> <p>Unable to find a permanent place to live, she was forced to take temporary jobs close to wherever she was staying. Now, at 22, she has been taken on by a recruitment agency, which has offered to train her as an accountant. The turnaround came after Nicolau visited Centrepoint and was offered temporary housing at the charity's Greek Street hostel, which provides accommodation for young people for up to six months.</p> <p>A key worker helped her realise she was not to blame for the break-up of her family and set out a plan for managing stressful situations. Staff supported her in getting a semi-permanent place at a five-bedroom house run by Cara, a housing association for young people with Irish backgrounds (her mother is Irish and her father is Greek). This has been home for nine months now.</p> <p>Nicolau, who hopes one day to have her own flat, says the counselling offered by Centrepoint staff was enormously helpful. \"I had felt very guilty about the way I left home. My key worker really understood me and never gave the impression that she was judging me. In fact, all the staff I came into contact with wanted to help. It was very reassuring. Everyone else seemed to stereotype homeless people as being stupid, unambitious, uncultured, a thief or a bum.\"</p> <p>Nicolau is now back in contact with her family, and is very excited about her new job. \"I am really looking forward to it,\" she says. \"I did my A-levels at college. Now I have a fantastic opportunity to train further. Everything seems possible.\"<br><strong>Linda Jackson</strong></p> <p><strong>Home for young mums was a blessing</strong></p> <p>Life looked grim for single mother Cheryl Austin after a row with her own mother over child discipline forced her to leave the family home.</p> <p>\"It was awful. Friends put us up for a few weeks and then we stayed with my cousins,\" Austin recalls. \"However, we couldn't stay forever, so I went to the council's homeless person's unit.\"</p> <p>That was two years ago. Today, the 22-year-old is getting ready to move into a new flat with her three-year-old daughter, Zara, and is training as a beautician. Austin considers herself lucky. Six months after becoming homeless, she was offered a place at a Centrepoint hostel for mothers and babies. Until then, she had been in temporary accommodation. The hostel gave her security and a chance to sort her life out.</p> <p>\"I couldn't go to my boyfriend for help because after I found out I was pregnant, he didn't want to know,\" she says. \"Thankfully, I was given a place in the hostel. At times, it can be stressful, but there's a great atmosphere and everyone supports one another.\"</p> <p>The nine-bedroom, double-fronted Victorian house in Brockley, south London, has a large garden for residents. Two support workers visit every day and offer help when needed.</p> <p>This can come in many forms. Last year, they organised a weekend at a health farm for the mothers with various workshops. Austin says it was a liberating experience for many.</p> <p>\"The support workers made us focus on ourselves as people and what we wanted from life. After that weekend, I realised I wanted to be a beautician.\"</p> <p>Austin, who has just started an NVQ course at Lewisham College says: \"I am very happy and Zara is happy. I feel truly blessed.\"<br>LJ</p>",
  "<p><strong>Prescott:</strong> We are going to build on the progress that we have made over the past seven years to really get to grips with homelessness and poverty. I'm proud of the work we've done so far. We've cut rough sleeping by 72% and more than doubled the amount we spend on affordable housing compared with 1997. We've strengthened the law to provide more protection for vulnerable homeless people and ended the scandal of homeless families forced to live for unacceptably long periods in B&amp;B hotels, with no room for their children to work, play and grow.</p> <p>While we have improved the situation for many thousands of people, young and old, there is still widespread inequality and that is clearly unacceptable. Decades ago, I think we ignored the problems of poverty and homelessness; today we are doing something about it.</p> <p>This really hit home the other day when I watched Cathy Come Home again for the first time in years. The film isn't just a masterpiece, it reminded me of how life was in the 60s and how shocking Cathy's story was. It showed the terrible consequences of living in a society where there was little support and no choice.</p> <p>For those who haven't seen it, Cathy got married and wanted to start a family and a nice home of her own. Things went wrong when her child arrived. The kid wasn't welcome. She put herself on the waiting list, but it didn't make any difference. She was then forced into short-term, emergency accommodation, where she had to separate from her husband.</p> <p>He went off looking for work and she was left on her own. In desperation, she ended up with her child in a caravan, but that wasn't safe. The caravan was set on fire. The last scene was heart-breaking when she was left to sleep on the street and in the railway station. Her child was taken away from her - she was homeless and alone.</p> <p>One day I want to be able to say that no young person in Britain is disadvantaged by their personal circumstances. We will give people the chance to live in a decent home, in a healthy and safe environment, with a solid education and secure employment. As I said, we have improved the situation for millions, but there's still a long way to go.</p> <p><strong>Centrepoint:</strong> Last month, the prime minister declared that the government's crusade against social exclusion was working, but his claim coincided with new figures that showed homelessness had reached a new record high. How do you square that circle?</p> <p><strong>Prescott:</strong> The important thing for us was to strengthen the law to give more vulnerable people - in particular young people - protection and accommodation and to bring them in to the welfare system. This contributes to a short-term statistical increase in homelessness. Of course, that creates good headlines for the papers and I have to live with that.</p> <p>For me, getting more help to more people is the most important thing - it shows that we are really making a difference. Having put the safety net into place, I expect the level of homelessness and use of temporary accommodation to fall over the next three years as our policies on prevention and housing start to take effect.</p> <p>I think that our approach to tackling inequality across the board is the right way. Investing in health, education, housing and employment is helping to tackle poverty for everyone. The challenge now is to get that support to the most disadvantaged. We already have 700,000 fewer kids in poverty and 1.85 million more people in work. We've also cut the number of non-decent homes by 1 million since 1997. No one can say for certain where we'll be in 10 years, but I'm convinced that we're making the right investments today.</p> <p><strong>Centrepoint:</strong> The government has a clear priority to reach the families most in need, but what action are you taking to reach those young people who have been thrown out of their family home?</p> <p><strong>Prescott:</strong> By addressing the needs of families today, we are helping to solve the problems that young people will face tomorrow. We have taken specific action to tackle homelessness among young people too. We amended the law to give housing priority to homeless 16- and 17-year-olds and young people leaving care. I'm also pleased that an independent evaluation of local authorities, due to be published later this year, has found that virtually all of their homelessness strategies make specific mention of young people's needs.</p> <p>More than 85% have considered specific proposals to help 16- and 17-year-olds, including targeted advice and support, specialist accommodation - like foyers - and family mediation. Like I said earlier, tackling the underlying inequalities, the underlying causes, is the most important thing. Of course, things do go wrong and a Labour government will be there to catch people when they fall.</p> <p><strong>Centrepoint:</strong> How can you tackle the problems of young homeless people effectively if you do not know how many there are, or where they're living?</p> <p><strong>Prescott:</strong> We already know a great deal about homelessness and we learn more every year from improved data. Next year, for example, we will be carrying out a major survey of homeless households, including 16- and 17-year-olds. The attempt by York University and Centrepoint to quantify the number of homeless young people is welcome, but I'm not sure about using figures from Scotland and applying them to England.</p> <p>I think the best way to understand the problem is to look at it at a regional and local level - that's where the problems are and where the services are delivered. The Homelessness Act is helping by identifying and dealing with homelessness through local reviews and strategies.</p> <p><strong>Centrepoint:</strong> Having expressed concern at the large number of housing associations, do you think there are too many homelessness charities?</p> <p><strong>Prescott:</strong> For a start, these charities are often focused on local areas and needs and they work collaboratively with others, like Centrepoint. In my view, coordination is essential to success, regardless of the number of organisations involved. The Homelessness Act is helping local authorities to develop even stronger partnerships with the voluntary sector, and I want to see this continue.</p> <p><strong>Painful past a stepping stone for future</strong></p> <p>As a 17-year-old with a troubled childhood, Stacey Bellamy left home with nowhere to go. For months, she relied on friends to put her up. Six years on, she is herself offering vital support to those facing homelessness.</p> <p>Bellamy, who lives in Durham, is part of an innovative project that aims to give practical support to young people in need of a home. Drawing on her own painful experience as a homeless teenager, she is helping to produce a pamphlet spelling out what it means to be homeless and offering practical advice on setting up home.</p> <p>She is also closely involved in the development of a \"buddy\" scheme, aimed at offering peer support.</p> <p>Bellamy, 23, says she was fortunate to find Moving On - a one-stop shop that offers housing advice and support to homeless youth, and is in partnership with Centrepoint. \"They helped me get my own flat and apply for funding for furniture,\" she says.</p> <p>However, there was a gap in support. This became clear when she attended a residential weekend organised by Moving On, and spoke with other young people about their needs. \"We did a presentation about a buddy support scheme and the importance of producing easy and user-friendly flyers about setting up your own home. Staff from Centrepoint said they could help us.\"</p> <p>Bellamy is now planning to go to college to study social work or youth work. \"I got my GCSEs. I'm back talking to my mum. We get on loads better,\" she says. \"Now I want to do more.\" <br><strong>Linda Jackson</strong></p> <p><strong>From the streets to the studio</strong></p> <p>Bianca Foster moved out of the flat she had shared with her boyfriend, Barrie, a few weeks after he died of cancer. Still grieving, the then 19-year-old stayed with her mother who had a tiny, one-bedroom flat. The arrangement didn't work out.</p> <p>\"It was too crowded and I was still getting over Barrie,\" Foster recalls. She went straight to Centrepoint's Berwick Street emergency shelter, where she stayed for a month before moving to Salter's Foyer.</p> <p>Today, the 23-year-old's life has been transformed. Staff at Salter's Foyer have helped her get her life back on track. She has her own flat in the hostel - and will shortly move to a flat in Bethnal Green, east London, where she will still be supported by a keyworker.</p> <p>Foster has made big strides in her career and is hoping for funding from the Prince's Trust charity. Earlier this year, she spent six months working for Channel Five. With her earnings, she bought a \u00a33,000 camera and she has now started filming musicians. She plans to set up her own media company.</p> <p>She is no stranger to television, having presented a music show for a cable station when she was 17. She says: \"I love the work. I go out every weekend and hunt managers down and ask them if I can interview their clients. I also want to make an underground film on graffiti artists.</p> <p>\"Ultimately, I want my own radio show. Barrie used to complain about the music when he was in hospital having chemotherapy. When I think I've got it hard, I think about Barrie and other people like him.

  "The historian Patrick Wormald, who has died aged 57 after a long struggle with alcoholism, was renowned for his monumental study, The Making Of English Law. In this work, which appeared five years ago, he brought off the dazzling feat of making narrow legal history seem like a total social panorama, while showing how laws reflect the cultural values of the societies that frame them. <p>Patrick's 35-year academic career began and ended at Oxford University, where his passion for Anglo-Saxon and early medieval England flowered in his work as scholar and teacher. He had been a King's scholar at Eton, became an undergraduate at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1966, and won a prize fellowship to All Souls College in 1969, when he was 22. </p> <p>As soon as he graduated, he started work on King Alfred's law code, and the All Souls fellowship gave him the time to develop a broad focus as a historian. Though a lifelong, devout Roman Catholic, he was certainly driven by the Protestant work ethic: he toiled prodigiously and never wasted time. </p> <p>Patrick learned Old English, and was soon an authority on all aspects and periods of Anglo-Saxon history. This is evident from his wonderful and large-scale contribution to The Anglo-Saxons (edited by James Campbell, 1982). But his interests extended far beyond Britain. For instance, in a series of Oxford seminars in the early 1970s on \"barbarian\" conversions, he showed an unexpected and comprehensive knowledge of the Visigoths, revealing his qual ity as a comparative historian. </p> <p>He was an outstanding member of a large circle of historians of similar age who radically revivified the study of early medieval history in the 1970s, and have continued to do so since. Much as he yearned to be the best in his field, he never failed, in conversation, to recognise that he was one of many in a common endeavour of scholarship. </p> <p>He owed much in his general historical formation to his tutor Maurice Keen, a master at drafting his pupils to the expertise they most needed. Others in Oxford who were pivotal in what might be called this movement in early medieval history were Michael Wallace-Hadrill, Peter Brown and James Campbell. Like all great scholars, however, Wormald, with all his imaginativeness, critical power and compelling style, never sounded like anyone but himself. </p> <p>His masterpiece, The Making Of English Law, appeared only in 1999, but colleagues saw it in the making for many years, in a long series of articles, several of almost book length, and some of an originality which took courage to publish. What strikes the non-legal historian most forcefully, besides the technical mastery - not least of the manuscripts - and the magnificent understanding of its setting in the Roman and Carolingian worlds, is the great sweep of social history that Patrick's legal history takes in. </p> <p>Patrick also made a gigantic contribution to the study of Bede's Ecclesiastical History, and of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf. In one of his earliest publications on Bede, he wrote: \"Bede's dynamic was neither learning nor common sense, but idealism.\" How right about Bede; and how right about his interpreter. </p> <p>From his earliest days at All Souls, Patrick was known, soon the world over, not only as an exceptional scholar, but also for his extraordinary power as a lecturer. His lectures were cocktails of originality, control and drama. They were never brief - he hated brevity - but time never hung heavily. </p> <p>In spite of the lure of Oxford, Patrick decided in 1974 to take up a lectureship in medieval history at Glasgow University. Far from feeling that he was going into exile, he eagerly welcomed the opportunity to join an institution with a powerful tradition completely different from Oxford. </p> <p>Early Scottish history became a passionate interest and, although it was never his frontline field, he published some remarkable contributions to it. For someone who was not incapable of id\u00e9es fixes, this showed the other side of the coin, his openness and generosity of spirit. It also pushed to the fore in his mind the question of what made England England. </p> <p> H e returned to Oxford in 1989 to become medieval history tutor at Christ Church, where he immediately established himself as one of the most brilliant tutors, and was supervisor to a number of the finest history graduate students. His success with them lay not only in the marvels of what he said, but also in his perception of their gifts and his generous encouragement of them. The same generosity extended to colleagues whose work he read, or listened to, and acknowledged handsomely. </p> <p>Patrick's later years were increasingly clouded and disrupted by depression and alcoholism. This was not because alcohol was a temptation he could not resist - he did not particularly enjoy alcoholic drinks as such - but because it was a resort from inner demons and perceived pressures that increasingly mounted in his life. There never was a clearer case of alcoholism as truly an illness. </p> <p>Although the demons and pressures clearly went back deep into his earlier life, Patrick never gave up the struggle - in therapies, in advice he took, in gaining flashes of understanding wherever he could, and, indeed, in prayer. Always, he remained in the arena. </p> <p>Hence, when he died, it was not through an act of despair, but because his body could no longer withstand what he physically imposed upon it. And, to the end, except in the worst circumstances, he was always a wonderfully incisive and stimulating conversationalist, as well as a most loyal friend. </p> <p>When he moved to Glasgow, Patrick met and married the historian Jenny Brown. Although their marriage was dissolved in 2001, they derived from each other a warm companionship and much reciprocal inspiration as scholars over many years. Patrick was devoted to, and extremely proud of, their sons Tom and Luke. In the most recent years, he enjoyed a close friendship with Veronica Ortenberg. </p> <p><b>Martin Kettle writes:</b> Patrick Wormald had a career on the Cherwell student newspaper in the late 1960s, and could have been a professional journalist had he chosen that course. He had a rare talent for a phrase. </p> <p>In April 1969, as Balliol undergraduates, he and I wrote a letter to the Sunday Times. Describing ourselves as enthusiastic, if unskilled, followers of cricket \"since we could first read Wisden\", we wrote that if the South African touring team came to England in 1970, we would do all we could to disrupt it. The letter created a minor furore. Old college members wrote angrily to the master, Christopher Hill, pressing for us to be expelled for giving succour to Peter Hain and his anti-apartheid troublemakers. </p> <p>Patrick ended our letter with the flourish that while one of us \"is a communist, and a Yorkshireman to boot\", the other held politi-cal views that \"would stand the scrutiny of the most persistent McCarthyite\". The phrases stuck and became a lasting private reference. </p> <p>When Patrick picked up the phone the last time I spoke to him, in April, I asked if that was, by any chance, the most persistent McCarthyite, to which he instantly responded that it must be a Yorkshireman to boot calling. He was in a better phase of his illness last spring, and we parted with words of love. The better phase did not last; but the love does. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Charles Patrick Wormald, historian, born July 9 1947; died September 29 2004</p>",
  "<p>England are backing a proposal to shift the Six Nations Championship to April and May as the global rugby community seeks a solution to the club v country fixture gridlock which is putting unsustainable pressure on the leading Test players. </p> <p>Rather than keep the northern hemisphere's most famous tournament in its traditional late winter slot on the European calendar, the Rugby Football Union's chief executive Francis Baron revealed yesterday that England, together with Wales, favour a reshuffle which would see the domestic programme completed before the Six Nations gets underway. </p> <p>\"It's not a case of moving it to June or July, we're not talking about that degree of movement,\" said Baron, among those who persuaded the International Rugby Board to hire the accountancy firm Deloitte and Touche to compile an independent report on the feasibility of a global season. \"I don't think that moving to April/May would dilute the Six Nations at all.\" </p> <p>He believes the switch, unpopular with traditionalists who have already seen the competition condensed into late February and March and prefer their Six Nations rugby on crisp winter days, will relieve some of the \"pressure points\" in the existing schedule and says its commercial value would not be affected by playing the games in early summer. </p> <p>Among several other proposals being considered by the IRB is for all other Test rugby to be played in late August and September, thus helping to avoid tours by under-strength teams. Some unions, including Scotland and Ireland, are reluctant to tamper with the successful Six Nations format but Baron insists all concerned should be more open-minded. </p> <p>\"We've all got to be flexible for the greater good,\" he said. All concerned do at least agree that something has to be done to restructure the global fixture list, not least Premier Rugby's chief executive Howard Thomas, who claimed that \"the preponderance of international rugby is out of control\". </p> <p>The RFU, meanwhile, yesterday announced a new five-year deal with Sky covering exclusive live rights to England's home games as well as the Zurich Premiership until 2010. </p> <p>It has also agreed a new four-year sponsorship agreement with the banking group Investec covering the autumn internationals and have finally agreed, in principle, to an improved financial package for England's squad players after months of haggling. </p>",
  "<p>The British grand prix is expected to be given a provisional date in next season's formula one world championship when the FIA publishes its draft calendar today, but in the background the tantalising prospect of a race around the streets of central London is still firing imaginations. </p> <p>Silverstone's place in the calendar will be provisional pending finalisation of commercial contracts with Bernie Ecclestone, but the formula one commercial rights holder is among those who are enthusiastic at the thought of Michael Schumacher slamming down the Mall at 175mph before opposite-locking his Ferrari F2007 through a chicane outside the front gates of Buckingham Palace. </p> <p>Supporters of a London grand prix do not wish to replace Silverstone and, given the huge practical problems involved, may never get the chance, but the impetus remains from the success of the Regent Street formula one demonstration in July that saw the West End jammed with over 200,000 spectators. </p> <p>\"I think it is a wonderful idea, but really there is no possibility, in my view,\" said Stirling Moss, once Britain's best-known grand prix driver. \"Of all the ideas for the route for a London grand prix, I certainly think that Hyde Park is the best. I think it would be a fabulous thing, but I don't really believe it is feasible today.\" </p> <p>Terence O'Rourke, an architect and environmental consultant with much motorsport design experience, can see the attractions of the Hyde Park concept, particularly as Park Lane West could be set up to be used as the pit lane and two-way road traffic could continue on the eastern carriageway while the track was being built. But O'Rourke, whose company planned the Rolls-Royce factory at Goodwood and Jonathan Palmer's autodrome in Bedford, is attracted to a more imaginative plan. </p> <p>\"Down the Mall, round in front of Buckingham Palace, where there could be a chicane, up Birdcage Walk to Hyde Park Corner and then back along Piccadilly,\" he said. \"Then you could perhaps spear down Haymarket, round Trafalgar Square and back down the Mall. There would be plenty of room for grandstands on this section, but I'm struggling a bit to find a place for the pits.\" </p> <p>Clive Bowen, a motorsport consultant who worked on the new Dubai circuit that hosted a round of the FIA GT Championship last week as its first international race, thinks that consideration for a London grand prix circuit should be given to the East End. </p> <p>\"I just shudder at the prospect of all the resurfacing work and run-off areas which would have to be carried out in the Park Lane area,\" he said. \"It's a spectacular concept, but with the regeneration of the area between the Lee Valley and the Millennium Dome area being earmarked for London's Olympic bid, it would be more logical to use the new roads in that area of the city as the basis for a circuit.\" </p> <p>The idea of a grand prix through the streets of London is not new. In 1960, when the Wolfenden Report advocated government support for a broad cross-section of sports in the United Kingdom, the late Innes Ireland, Lotus's formula one team leader, advocated a grand prix through Hyde Park. </p> <p>\"Yes, I'm being serious,\" he wrote. \"It would be a fabulous circuit. You could get so many hundreds of thousands of spectators into it that it would make a real pile for the sport. Then one could rent out the windows of nearby hotels. Grandstands could be erected in no time. We see them go up and down at the drop of a hat these days, in any case.\" </p> <p>Ireland, one of the most popular drivers of his era, ironically went on briefly to become the president of the British Racing Drivers' Club, which owns Silverstone, before his death in 1993. </p> <p>Moss fears its organisation may be more difficult now. \"When I was racing the cars were capable of being road-raced without any problems. When the idea of a race through Hyde Park was mooted in the 1960s, the only real organisational challenge was to control the crowd. Now they would have to put in chicanes, a loop here and a loop there, to keep the speeds down. And where would you park all the transporters? Silverstone to my mind remains the only venue where it can realistically be held.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Collier, the chief-executive of Nottinghamshire, will today trade the relative tranquillity of Trent Bridge for the more fevered surroundings of Lord's when he is officially appointed to the equivalent post at the England and Wales Cricket Board. </p> <p>Collier, who is expected to take up his role in the new year on a salary in excess of \u00a3170,000, replaces Tim Lamb who stepped down last month after a seven-year reign, and represents a safe rather than radical appointment at a time when the game faces challenges on several fronts. </p> <p>A veteran of four counties - he was assistant secretary at Essex, secretary at Gloucestershire and chief-executive at Leicestershire prior to joining Nottinghamshire in 2000 - Collier has also been a stalwart of the ECB's management board, the body that approved his application late on Monday night, and as such his appointment is a victory for the chairman David Morgan. </p> <p>Morgan has always had an acute ear for the concerns of the shires, not least because of his background as chairman of Glamorgan, and Collier's mixture of county experience and financial and administrative competence will have made him an easy sell to his erstwhile colleagues. </p> <p>The other two candidates who made the final stage of a recruitment process were both relative outsiders. Richard Bevan of the Professional Cricketers' Association has been something of a thorn in the ECB's side over Zimbabwe, while Matthew Wheeler, an expert in sports marketing and former professional player, proved too long a shot for the board. </p> <p>Collier, whose posts at Gloucestershire and Leicestershire bookended a spell working in the leisure division of Seema, a computer systems company, is a genial and approachable character who can point to great success in handling Nottinghamshire. </p> <p>The Trent Bridge Test, held in a sympathetically re-developed ground, has become a highlight of the calendar, and no blame can be attached to Collier for the departure of Kevin Pietersen, who yesterday announced his decision to quit the county after a season which saw them win the Second Division of the County Championship and gain promotion from the Second Division of the National League. </p> <p>At Lord's Collier will face more diverse challenges. Lamb's tenure saw the national team improve while the ECB's relations with its international counterparts declined and the recreational game was left feeling neglected. These last two areas will need attention, as will the ECB's major commercial contracts and broadcast deals, and Sport England's demands that the ECB reform its structures. </p>",
  "<p>Mark Chilton will become Lancashire's first Yorkshire-born captain next season. The batsman, who describes himself as Mancunian despite his Sheffield birthplace, will take over from Warren Hegg, who confirmed his resignation yesterday after Lancashire's relegation from the First Division of the County Championship. </p> <p>\"I'm a Manchester lad and I've come through Lancashire cricket, so captaining Lancashire is something I've always dreamed about,\" said the 28-year-old, who follows the same path as Mike Atherton and John Crawley, former Old Trafford captains who attended Manchester Grammar School.</p> <p>Stuart Law, the Australian who was the other leading contender to succeed Hegg, becomes vice-captain.</p> <p>Chilton made his county debut in 1997, when he was captaining Durham University, and has been a regular in the team for the past three seasons. He struggled with the rest of the batsmen last summer, having passed 1,000 first-class runs for the first time the previous year, but Law dismissed suggestions that the captaincy would be an extra burden.</p> <p>\"A lot of players have had that question put to them but I reckon 95% of the time the player's performances improve with the captaincy and I'm sure that will be the case with Mark,\" said Law, who hopes to receive a British passport before Christmas.</p> <p>Surrey, meanwhile, are the favourites to sign Kevin Pietersen after Nottinghamshire said yesterday that the South African, who is likely to make his England debut in Zimbabwe next month, has turned down a new contract.</p> <p>\"We offered him a new three-year deal on a considerable salary which would have maintained his status as one of the highest-paid players at the club,\" said the Notts director of cricket Mick Newell. \"It's very disappointing because, from a pure cricket point of view, I can't see what else we could have done to make him stay.\"</p> <p>Pietersen, who was signed by Newell's predecessor Clive Rice four years ago, says he has had offers from four First Division counties, with Kent expected to be Surrey's main rivals.</p> <p>Gloucestershire have signed Steve Kirby, the fiery pace bowler who was released by Yorkshire at his own request last month.</p>",
  "<p>When David Collier uproots from Nottinghamshire and puts his feet under the desk of the England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive at Lord's he will be taking on an organisation in relatively robust health financially, with an Australian bonanza to come next summer, but one where morale must be at a low ebb. </p> <p>The past season has seen top men abandoning the ship: first the commercial director, Mark Sibley, for less rancorous pastures; next Des Wilson, the non-executive chairman of the board's marketing advisory committee, who resigned amid the increasing mayhem of the Zimbabwe affair; then the director of corporate affairs John Read; and finally the chief executive himself, Tim Lamb, who, in the wake of almost daily criticism over his handling of the Zimbabwe situation, signed off at the end of last month. </p> <p>In addition there were moves to restructure the administration of the English game, strong criticism of the way professional cricket is run and despairing calls from the grass roots. </p> <p>Who, in his right mind, would want to take over an organisation in such turmoil where the future structure is not apparent, key figures are not in place and core negotiations are being handled by selected county chairmen? </p> <p>The headhunters Norman Broadbent whittled the best part of 100 applicants down to 29 and then three: Collier, chief executive at Nottinghamshire, Richard Bevan, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers' Association, and Matthew Wheeler, briefly a first-class cricketer with Northamptonshire, whose expertise is sports marketing. </p> <p>Now Collier, with broad experience around the counties, and in other sport, has got the vote. He finalised terms with the board chairman David Morgan yesterday afternoon and, the decision having been ratified by other board management members, he is to be unveiled at Lord's this morning. </p> <p>It seems, on the face of it, to be a comfortable appointment rather than the contentious item it might have been had such a senior post been passed outside the game. </p> <p>The 48-year-old Collier, although already on the ECB management board, is of the counties and as such will appeal to them overall. They may even feel they will retain some control that might otherwise disappear. There is, however, an element in the shires, articulated by the ECB vice-chairman and former chairman of Surrey, Mike Soper, that believes an organisation with a turnover in excess of \u00a370m requires, first and foremost, someone who can handle that aspect, with cricket secondary. That would turn on its head Lamb's clinching soundbite about cricket being a business within a sport. </p> <p>Cricket matters can be delegated; it is not so easy with the business side. In this regard financial constraints may have been a consideration: a package that includes a salary in excess of \u00a3170,000 is not to be sniffed at but there is a feeling that the calibre of person Soper had in mind would not be available at such a price. </p> <p>Collier will not be fazed by the internal machinations of his new job. His varied background, including spells with three counties - Essex, Gloucestershire and Leicestershire - prior to Nottinghamshire, a time away from the game with the travel, leisure and tourism division of Sema, the Cheshire-based computer systems company, and connections with the administration of the English Hockey Association, give him his broad base. The sympathetic manner in which Trent Bridge has been redeveloped, moreover, is a further testament to careful use of funds. </p> <p>He will, though, find a broad raft of issues awaiting that will be outside his previous experience, including the renegotiation of broadcasting rights, international relations and a brief to tighten up the way funds from Sport England are to be used if they are to be continued. </p> <p>Of these it is the latter that may most occupy his immediate energies. The allocation of broadcasting rights is already well advanced - and the board's immediate issue with Zimbabwe will have been and gone, although there will be bridges still to be mended with the international cricket community. </p> <p>The prospect, though, of not retaining a share of Sport England's \u00a3100m is something that the game can neither contemplate nor afford. </p> <p><strong> Honest broker who helped hockey out of a corner</strong><br> </p> <p> When David Collier, pictured right, was appointed vice-president of the English Hockey Association in 2001 the governing body was insolvent. Within a year, debts of more than \u00a31m were uncovered -future obligations taking the figure as high as \u00a31.5m - and the chief executive Richard Wyatt had fallen on his sword. </p> <p>Collier, also a well-respected international hockey umpire, was one of the team of honorary officials charged with finding a way through the financial morass, which could have left the clubs with the responsibility for the debts. More than \u00a3600,000 was owed in VAT alone. Collier opened negotiations and contributed to reducing the figure to more manageable proportions -it was initially halved then halved again. </p> <p>Stewart Newton, a millionaire Brighton businessman, provided the interim funds to keep the sport afloat, and the EHA president Mike Corby led a management team. Collier was seen as an honest and reliable broker who did much unsung work, and although he had no formal role once the new governing body was up and running in mid-2002, he continued to offer advice. Only recently have the debts been resolved, creditors receiving 30p in the pound. </p> <p><strong>Challenges awaiting the new man in cricket's hot seat</strong></p> <p><strong> International relations</strong> </p> <p> By the time David Collier takes up his post full-time in the new year England will be engaged in a Test series in South Africa and, for the players at least, their November fortnight in Zimbabwe will be a distant memory. But for the new chief executive the damage done to the ECB's reputation within the International Cricket Council is an unavoidable reality. </p> <p>Collier will have to gain the respect of his fellow national board chief executives quickly and establish a healthy working relationship with them if the ECB is not to continue to be outmanoeuvred in the future. An ongoing project, but an important one. </p> <p> <strong> Finances and commercial relations</strong> </p> <p> The key challenge. The ECB's annual turnover of \u00a370m will represent something of an increase for the Nottinghamshire chief executive, used to the more modest sums involved in handling a county balance sheet. The looming threat of debt will be more familiar, however. The ECB has a negligible reserve, a fact that explained its jumpiness over the threat of financial sanctions from the ICC over Zimbabwe. </p> <p>The ECB's major commercial contracts - with Npower and Vodafone - are also approaching the renegotiation stage and the structure of the game means cricket has access to only a reduced pool of commercial backers. </p> <p>A bright note comes in the form of a new TV deal, due to be finalised in the next few weeks. Negotiations are at an advanced stage, with Channel 4 thought to be favourites to renew its deal, but it is expected to have to match the last deal at least, worth \u00a3150m over three years. </p> <p>Collier will have an input into the final stages of negotiations even if he is not officially in post, and a positive outcome would see his tenure begin on the front foot. </p> <p> <strong> Structure</strong> </p> <p> Collier will find gathering dust in the in-tray he inherits a document called the Carpenter Review. He will be familiar with its contents, particularly its observations on the ECB's corporate governance. </p> <p>Bluntly David Carpenter concludes that \"this is the most difficult area in which to put forward clear recommendations due to the need to develop clear strategy and a lack of consensus on what the optimum structure should look like\". </p> <p>The committee-dominated structure militates against effective decision-making and does not serve the best interests of the game \"from playground to Test arena\". Any change would involve a weakening of the counties' power and potentially a clash with the ECB chairman David Morgan, the great conciliator. </p> <p> <strong> Overseas players</strong> </p> <p> The huge rise in the number of overseas players active in county cricket by virtue of their EU-born grandparents and the Kolpak ruling has the same potential to hinder the development of home-grown talent as the influx of foreign players has in football. Limiting the numbers of players not qualified for England would run counter to EU law, so the counties must be persuaded to show their commitment to the development of English cricket. </p> <p> <strong> Sport England</strong> </p> <p> From 2005 Sport England is to introduce a four-year funding cycle with all sports dependent on it meeting certain criteria. The ECB, which has been criticised recently by Sport England's chief executive Roger Draper, stands to gain millions from the arrangement but has much to prove. </p> <p>Business plans need to be on the table at Sport England in the new year and Collier will need to ensure that his is up to the mark if Sport England is to match the largesse of previous years. (County academies benefit from \u00a350,000 of Sport England funding each year, and the Loughborough base of the ECB academy was 85% paid for by the body.) Sport England may not be universally popular with the ECB board but Collier knows he cannot afford to ignore it. </p> <p> <strong> Recruitment</strong> </p> <p> Collier fills the most senior vacancy at the ECB but replacements for the communications director John Read, who worked with the recreational game and funding agencies, and the commercial director Mark Sibley are a matter of urgency.</p>",

  "<p>They are notorious as dirty, graffiti-covered havens for bullies and teenage smokers.
