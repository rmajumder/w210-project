  "They had sniffer dogs, gas masks and came from Chechnya. From inside Middle School No 1, they watched the siege on television and rang accomplices from mobile phones who told them what was going on around the building. <p>Yesterday investigators and eyewitnesses gave the Guardian a detailed picture of how some 30 highly organised militants launched the events which claimed up to 400 lives and left 562 people injured in hospital, according to local officials. </p> <p>Sergei Ignatchenko, spokesman for the Russian security services, the FSB, said in a telephone interview: \"They were very well trained. They had gas masks, as they had learned lessons from the Moscow theatre siege [where Russian special forces released a knockout gas into the auditorium to end the standoff]. They planted mines in every corridor. They brought with them two sniffer dogs.\" </p> <p>He said they were assisted by observers outside the school. \"They stood in the crowd wearing civilian clothes, and told them what was happening. The terrorists came from Chechnya, that we know.\" </p> <p>Margarita Komoyeva, 44, a physics teacher held with her daughters Diana, 14, Alina, 11, and Madina, 3, was released with Madina in the first batch of hostages. She said the militants watched TV coverage of the attack. \"From TV reportage they understood that hostages in the gym were making phone calls and again forced us to hand over our phones.\" Another eyewitness said they shot a man for making a call. </p> <p>Ms Komoyeva said: \"Later one of the Chechens ran inside shouting, 'They are saying there are only 300 hostages here. This is because they want there to be fewer victims announced when they storm. If they don't care about you, then we won't either. We will fight and when we run out of ammo, blow both you and us away.'\" </p> <p>Another hostage, Oksana Yuzhkeivich, told how the militants made her walk out to safety holding someone else's baby - and leaving behind her daughters and mother. For nearly 24 hours, neither woman had known that the other - and the child - had survived. </p> <p>Raya Yuzhkeivich, 55, said the militants fired into the air and told people to shut up. But children continued to cry. So they shot two men and vowed to shoot more if the hostages were not quiet. </p> <p>Investigators have struggled to work out how the militants got so much explosive into the school so quickly, leading many to suspect that some of the explosives had been hidden in the school during renovations over the summer. </p> <p>It emerged yesterday that the shooting began when a bomb inside the gym went off by accident, triggering an attack by local men in an armed militia. </p> <p>The former president of neighbouring Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, a negotiator, said he was in contact with Chechens until the last moment on telephone. He told the newspaper Novaya Gazeta: \"We sent people to collect the 21 dead. We agreed that a lorry with five doctors would come. When they arrived something happened at this school and a bomb went off.\" </p> <p>At that moment the shooting began. \"I called the [militants] to ask them to stop shooting. They said: 'We have stopped, it is your side.' But the official troops were not shooting, the terrorists were not shooting, and we are screaming at each other, 'Who is?' The men in the school said: 'That's it, the storm has begun, we will explode the bombs'.\" </p> <p>He said he told them the elite Alfa unit was not storming the school. \"We [in the crisis headquarters] ordered any shooting to be stopped, but a foolish third force - some kind of people's militia - appeared. They had AK-47s and decided to free the hostages. We are trying to investigate how all this happened.\"</p>",
  "<p>With England's team hotel being only a couple of streets from the museum of the world's smallest books, it was perhaps fitting that David Beckham brought his own mini-drama to Katowice. Having missed training he had a scan in the afternoon which revealed no underlying problems, but his fitness will continue to be assessed to determine whether he can take part in tomorrow's World Cup qualifier against Poland at the Slaski Stadium in nearby Chorzow. </p> <p>Beckham took a blow to his chest during Saturday's 2-2 draw in Austria. Although he completed the match and did not need medical treatment on the pitch, he could not finish a light workout before the team boarded yesterday's flight from Vienna. </p> <p>The initial diagnosis is that he has nothing more serious than bruised ribs, in which case he should be able to play. If he has cracked a rib, however, England will almost certainly have to get by without their captain for only the second time in a competitive fixture since Sven-Goran Eriksson's appointment as manager. </p> <p>Shaun Wright-Phillips, Manchester City's talented midfielder, has been placed on standby but Eriksson is under such pressure right now that the thought of playing without his captain may be enough to wake him in a cold sweat. </p> <p>The beleaguered manager will also have been relieved to have a day off media duties given the relentless criticism since Saturday's frittering away of a two-goal lead, although he can still count on the backing of his players. </p> <p>After the public vote of confidence from Gary Neville it was Steven Gerrard's turn yesterday to voice his support. \"I don't think you can blame the manager,\" said Gerrard. \"You've got to blame the players who are picked to do a job. If the job is not being done properly you've got to focus on the players. </p> <p>\"If it was any other England manager in charge he would pick more or less the same players to do the job. A manager can do only do so much and then it's down to the players to take responsibility.\" </p> <p>The danger is that the near-unremitting criticism of Eriksson will eventually damage the players' confidence, but Gerrard counters that it should have a galvanising effect. </p> <p>\"The stick we got after the Austria game should unite us in the need to do better. It should give us an extra incentive to support the manager and do better. </p> <p>\"I don't think the criticism is unfair. If we're two goals ahead against Austria with 70 minutes gone, you would expect us to win. So it is fair. </p> <p>\"We saw two different England sides in the same game. For 70 minutes we had the game under control, played some nice stuff and looked dangerous. Then, for 20 minutes, it was a completely different side. We stopped playing and we looked all over the place defensively. </p> <p>\"We should have beaten them comfortably, so it's worrying. If you think a game is won after 70 minutes it's dangerous, too. Against a better side than Austria we could have lost the game.\" </p> <p>Gerrard's early withdrawal from training yesterday was a precautionary measure rather than any indication that he aggravated his recurrent groin problems, but despite declaring himself fit he was noticeably subdued. </p> <p>A pattern is emerging of England forfeiting leads and Gerrard, a perfectionist in everything he does on the field, is not afraid to stray off the party line and be honest about the team's occasionally dishevelled displays. </p> <p>\"We've got a lot of improving to do. I'm confident we can win the group and get to the World Cup, but the way we have lost to Brazil [in the 2002 World Cup] and Portugal [Euro 2004], and what happened to us in Austria, shows why there are so many question marks hanging over us. </p> <p>\"We need to learn how to deal with two-nothing games, how to hold on to leads and finish teams off. There have been times when we have let games slip, and mentally that can creep into your heads. </p> <p>\"People will look at David James's mistake [for Austria's equaliser] but it was the errors leading up to it that were just as important. The move came from deep in their own half. We have to keep our shape better and learn things psychologically and tactically. These are the things we will have to work on in training and talk about in detail.\"</p>",
  "<p>Wales are considering a protest to Fifa over their treatment in Azerbaijan. </p> <p>The Welsh, who host Northern Ireland tomorrow, claim to have been the victims of a string of incidents while they were in Baku, alleging that their baggage was looted as they were waiting to fly back to Cardiff after the 1-1 draw. </p> <p>The Wales party were left sitting on the tarmac for an hour after boarding their flight home before the luggage was finally loaded. When they landed, players found their cases had been looted and that shirts and kit had been stolen. </p> <p>But the FA of Wales is more concerned with the military control of the match at the Tofik Bakhramov Stadium. \"We were concerned that in fact the match was run by the army with the Azerbaijan FA having little control,\" said an FAW spokesman. \"A whole list of administrative problems arose during the trip.\" </p> <p>The pressing matter for Wales is now Northern Ireland, whose manager Lawrie Sanchez is determined to give his supporters a performance to be proud of following their 3-0 defeat to Poland on Saturday. </p> <p>\"We know we let the public down against Poland,\" said Sanchez. \"Now we have to make it up to them.\"</p>",
  "<p> In the wake of sacking Sir Bobby Robson eight days ago, Newcastle United said that they wanted someone young, British and stern to be their new manager. In that light it is no great surprise that Graeme Souness was named as Newcastle's chosen replacement yesterday. </p> <p> At 51 Souness is youthful compared to 71 year-old Robson. Edinburgh-born means he is British, while there is not a person in football who would not describe Souness as stern. But that does not mean yesterday's news was not a surprise, and an alarming one to many fans. </p> <p> Souness's name has long been mentioned around St James' Park as a likely successor to Robson, but not so much over the past week, not least because Newcastle's next game is against the club Souness has just left, Blackburn Rovers. </p> <p> That fixture coincidence is why Souness will not take charge at St James' until next Monday. His first game in control will be the Uefa Cup home leg against Bnei Sakhnin of Israel on Thursday week. </p> <p> Souness will bring with him his Blackburn backroom team - Alan Murray, Phil Boersma and Dean Saunders - and he will reportedly sign a five-year contract. A rumoured \u00a320m is at his disposal in January and next summer. </p> <p> Blackburn have been paid a \"satisfactory level of compensation\" according to their chief executive John Williams, not unexpectedly as it is believed they were considering whether Souness had reached the end of his time at the Lancashire club. </p> <p> Souness, for his part, was meant to be pondering his future. Last season he mused that Blackburn, where he was contracted to 2006, would be his last job in football. He was thought to be thinking of emigrating to Australia. </p> <p> \"I'm 50 in May,\" Souness said then, \"but I might wake up one morning very soon and say I've had enough.\" But instead, in a rapid course of developments over the weekend, Souness agreed to fly to the north-east. </p> <p> \"I'm sad to be leaving here,\" he said as he left Blackburn's training ground yesterday. \"I'm joining one of the biggest clubs around and I'm really excited about it. I think I'm ready for a big challenge. I'm sure some will be unhappy with it, but I can't help feeling excited about the prospects of Newcastle United. I think I'm ready for a big challenge.\" </p> <p> Souness's new boss, the Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd, described him as \"highly experienced - we look forward to him building on the progress we have made in recent years.\" </p> <p> Shepherd needs that to happen because the initial reaction from the Newcastle public was predominantly negative and Shepherd is being accused of mismanaging the club. The Celtic manager Martin O'Neill was the supporters' choice after Alan Shearer's withdrawal from consideration. In the circumstances, a poor start and Souness will be under immediate pressure. </p> <p> \"Graeme is very reluctant to leave a job he considers one of the best in the business, but he views Newcastle as a massive opportunity and one he cannot resist,\" said Williams. \"We wish him well and thank him for four successful years.\" </p> <p> Williams should have described those years as sometimes successful. That accounted for Souness's name being out of circulation in the last week as Newcastle approached Steve Bruce, Shearer, Sam Allardyce, Steve McClaren and Terry Venables. Souness was barely mentioned. That shows how far his public esteem had fallen since the heights of Blackburn's 2002 League Cup victory. Blackburn finished sixth in the Premiership the following season, qualifying for the Uefa Cup, and Souness was a much more prominent candidate to succeed Robson then than Bruce for example. </p> <p> Newcastle's reluctant acceptance over the weekend that they could not get Bruce out of Birmingham City for a satisfactory sum led them to Souness. </p> <p> But last season was a disappointment at Blackburn, the club winning four of their last six matches to finish 15th. This season has not started promisingly either, Blackburn drawing at home to West Brom, then losing at Arsenal and Southampton before the 1-1 home draw with Manchester United. As Shepherd sounded out Venables in London on Saturday morning, Souness was preparing to travel to Doncaster Rovers on the sort of scouting mission that unearthed Jon Stead from Huddersfield Town. But the proximity of agent Paul Stretford to both Souness and Shepherd meant there was always a tenable connection.</p> <p> Souness also had contact with Newcastle recently as he tried to bring Shearer back to Blackburn. Now one of his first tasks is to decide whether to recall Shearer for Newcastle.</p>",
  "Tali Fahima served her time in the Israeli army, voted for Ariel Sharon as prime minister and took it as given that her country was struggling for survival against terrorism. <p>Then last year, the 29-year-old legal secretary from Tel Aviv picked up a newspaper and read about Zakariya Zubeidi, the Jenin leader of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the group responsible for killing hundreds of Israelis in suicide bombings and shootings. Ms Fahima decided she would ask Mr Zubeidi why he killed Jews. </p> <p>On Sunday, the military placed Ms Fahima in detention without trial using a law applied to thousands of Palestinians over the past four years of intifada but rarely to Israelis. </p> <p>The authorities declined to reveal the precise reasons but the defence minister, Shaul Mofaz, who signed the order, described her as \"a clear and present danger to all Israelis\". </p> <p>Intelligence sources told the Israeli press that Ms Fahima had a hand in bombing an army checkpoint last month, and that she was planning attacks inside Israel. </p> <p>But Ms Fahima's lawyers and friends accuse the government of using draconian security laws to silence her because she has broken a taboo against befriending and explaining the enemy. </p> <p>Ms Fahima started visiting Mr Zubeidi in Jenin a little more than a year ago, despite an Israeli ban on its citizens travelling to Palestinian towns. She said she wanted to find out what motivated him to kill. </p> <p>\"I had to ask why a man goes ahead and does this,\" she told Israeli television this year. \"There is a reason for this. A man doesn't wake up one morning and decide, 'OK, I'm going to carry out an attack.'\" </p> <p>The army describes Mr Zubeidi as one of its most-wanted terrorists. It has tried in vain to kill him five times. </p> <p>After several meetings with the al-Aqsa brigade's commander, Ms Fahima described him as a freedom fighter and \"a kindhearted person whom I was lucky to meet\". She said she would be a human shield to protect him from Israeli assassination attempts. </p> <p>\"It is hard for a 28-year-old girl who was brought up on certain values to find out one day that they are all wrong,\" she told the Jerusalem Post in June. \"Who causes the occupation? The Palestinians? No. It is the Israelis and who am I? A Jew and an Israeli and by sitting at home and doing nothing I am also responsible. </p> <p>\"Zubeidi is not a terrorist, rather he is fighting against the occupation. Suicide bombers are also fighting the occupation. Put yourself in their place and see what happens. They are denied basic rights and freedom.\" </p> <p>Those views have infuriated many Israelis who have denounced Ms Fahima as a traitor and terrorist sympathiser. Her religious parents refuse to speak to her, and she was sacked from her job. </p> <p>Ms Fahima's lawyers say if there were evidence she was involved in violence the authorities would have laid charges, not place her in the limbo of administrative detention. </p> <p>The justice minister, Yosef Lapid, said the activist has not been charged due to the need to protect intelligence sources. </p> <p>\"There is very, very concrete evidence in the material indicating that she acted in a manner that endangers the security of Israel. Until there is a trial, the relevant officials believe that it would be better from the point of view of the security of Israel that she remain in detention,\" he said. </p> <p>But Ms Fahima's lawyer, Smadar Ben-Natan, says her client was detained last month after refusing to inform for the Shin Bet. </p> <p>\"[The intelligence services] are attempting to prove to her that she is politically mistaken, they are giving her history lessons, debating with her whether this should be described as occupation, whether Palestinian fighters should be defined as freedom fighters or as terrorists,\" she said. </p> <p>One of Ms Fahima's friends, Lin Dovrat, a peace activist, said the political motives behind her detention were clear from the authorities' claim that information against her was too sensitive to be made public in court while the Shin Bet leaked accusations to the press. </p> <p>\"They tried to kill Zubeidi five times and failed and she got to him and was able to talk to him and was able to connect with him on a very basic human level and I think that drives them nuts,\" she said. </p> <p>Ms Ben-Natan says that when Ms Fahima refused to collaborate with the Shin Bet, it sought to discredit her by telling journalists she was sleeping with Mr Zubeidi, who is married. It is an accusation widely given credibility in the Israeli press, and denied by Ms Fahima.</p>",
  "Salem Chalabi, the man organising the trial of Saddam Hussein, has been sacked from his job after allegedly failing to return from Britain to face a murder charge in Iraq. <p>Mr Chalabi, whose uncle Ahmad Chalabi is the controversial founder of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), has been removed as the head of the Iraqi special tribunal responsible for Saddam's case, INC officials said last night. </p> <p>The move comes almost a month after an Iraqi judge issued a warrant for his arrest on suspicion of murdering a senior official in the finance ministry. </p> <p>Another was issued for Ahmad Chalabi, accusing him of money laundering. Both men have denied the accusations, calling them \"ridiculous\". </p> <p>Last night Salem Chalabi described his sacking as \"illegitimate\", saying: \"I intend to challenge it.\" </p> <p>In an email to the Guardian, he said he had been appointed to the \"independent tribunal\" overseeing Saddam's trial for a period of three years - and that its status had been enshrined in Iraq's transitional administrative law. Without changing that status it was impossible for him to be sacked, he said. </p> <p>He added: \"Obviously I have a lot to say about this ... Coupled with the false allegation made against me, which is being resolved now, it seems that somebody in the government or connected to it does not want me to return to my position or move the tribunal forward.\" </p> <p>A senior INC spokesman, Mudhar Shawkat, said yesterday: \"Salem has been sacked. They accuse him of not turning up to work. </p> <p>\"But this is silly. Officials in the Iraqi government had told him not to return to Iraq, and then they go and sack him.\" </p> <p>He added: \"This will definitely hurt the credibility of Saddam's trial. He [Salem Chalabi] is being punished because of his connections.\" </p> <p>Salem Chalabi, a 41-year-old lawyer, has been in London since July. He did not return to Iraq after he was named as a suspect for the murder in the summer of Haithem Fadhil, the director general of the finance ministry. </p> <p>According to official sources, Iraq's council of ministers has given his job to Talib al-Zubeidi, another lawyer. </p> <p>Earlier this week, Qassim Daoud, a minister in the new government, said that Saddam and other members of the deposed Iraqi regime would be brought to trial before elections that are scheduled for January. </p> <p>Mr Daoud's comments appeared to contradict a statement by Salem Chalabi this year, when he said preparations for the trial would take two years. </p> <p>In July, Saddam appeared in public for the first time since last year's capture. He was arraigned before an Iraqi judge, and charged with a series of crimes against humanity.</p>",
  "<p>Disgruntled shareholders in troubled nuclear generator British Energy tried to block its life-saving restructuring package yesterday. </p> <p>Two of BE's institutional investors - Polygon Investments and Brandes Investment Partners - have demanded a special meeting to table changes to the firm's rules, which would prevent it delisting from the stock market without their permission. </p> <p>British Energy has insisted that the deal, which will leave shareholders with only 2.5% of the company, is the best it can achieve. It has warned that it may put itself into insolvency - leaving investors with nothing - if they fail to approve the rescue plan. But the two investor groups want a larger stake for shareholders. </p> <p>The government-backed restructuring was agreed last year, but has taken longer to complete because of the need for European commission state aid clearance. </p> <p>The plan involved banks and bondholders agreeing to write off \u00a31.3bn in debt in return for control of the group. As part of the deal, British Energy pledged to improve its performance.</p>",
  "<p>Cazenove's finding itself in a quandary over its corporate future might conjure up a cliche or two about sick doctors and their apparent inability to heal themselves. </p> <p>But we should underline our humanist concerns here: David Mayhew, benevolent chairman of the gilded stock brokerage, seems to have whittled his firm's choice over its future ownership down to \"death now\" or \"death a little bit later\". It's that stark - or at least it threatens to be. </p> <p>Selling Cazenove, a quintessentially British institution, to Lehman Brothers, a happy-clappy Wall Street firm which has struggled for years to win British companies over to its peculiar brand of evangelical finance, would kill Caz overnight. And yet selling to JP Morgan, a truly massive American financial conglomerate, would seem to promise much the same outcome, albeit delayed. </p> <p>This is the bank (JP Morgan Chase Manhattan Chemical Manufacturers Hanover Texas Commercial National Bank of Detroit Bank One First Chicago, to provide its main DNA) that acquired the sterling name of Robert Fleming, only to sack about 90% of the staff within months of taking over. Entire divisions, built up over one hundred and something years, were executed overnight - in the middle of the millennium boom, when investment bankers were supposed to be in short supply. Goodness knows what might have been done to this venerable City of London business in the tougher climate of today. </p> <p>Mindful of their destructive record, JP Morgan is proposing an altogether different arrangement this time. </p> <p>Cazenove, it is mooted, will operate as a joint venture, with the British corporate broker having access to the American's capital guarantees (allowing them to shovel lots more risk on to Cazenove's posh-but-skinny balance sheet), while simultaneously retaining a large measure of cultural independence. </p> <p>On paper at least, Mr Mayhew and his silken associates would be able to pursue - and, indeed, expand - their existing relationships with Britain's corporate elite while still remaining free of the crass sales spiel that usually arrives with any American investment banking proposition. </p> <p>Clearly, the success or failure of this JV approach would depend on the people involved - which is where the JP model begins to get rather interesting. </p> <p>It has been suggested that about 50 JP Morgan staff would move over from the American bank to \"help\" Mr Mayhew and his team promote Cazenove's enhanced financial offerings. This team would be headed by Ian Hannam, a British financier of some repute. </p> <p>Mr Hannam is a former soldier who may or may not have spent a number of years working for British military intelligence in and around the Gulf, before skipping off to Wall Street in the 80s to work for Salomon Brothers in the days when John Meriwether, the king of the bond traders, was busy perfecting his Liar's Poker hand. Mr Hannam was subsequently posted to London, where he arranged the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers - only to get it in the neck when Robert Maxwell went overboard in the Med. </p> <p>Yet when Salomon (now part of Citigroup) let its man go it seems to have been unaware that he was about to pick up the job of selling much of the Wellcome Trust's holding in the Wellcome drugs company, before it merged with Glaxo - a \u00a33bn share placing that was bigger than anything the London stock market had seen before. Mr Hannam took the Wellcome business to Flemings, cementing his name as one of the biggest fee-earners the London market had seen in years. </p> <p>Yet in the process he also developed a name for aggression, leading one rival to observe that the man \"comes from the smack-'em-in-the-gob school of corporate finance\". In short, Mr Hannam is respected but not universally liked. How he might work with Mr Mayhew, the svelte end of London's financial community, is anyone's guess. It promises to be hugely entertaining. </p> <p><strong>Waiving the rules </strong></p> <p>Europe's financial regulators, led by our dear Financial Services Authority, have spent a decade or so extending their control over the flow of information that moves around financial markets. </p> <p>The rules are clear: information that may affect the price of a security has to be released to all market participants in a formal and timely manner. The penalties for breaking the rules are onerous, with Britain's market abuse regime soon to be emulated by a string of European directives. </p> <p>How quaint, then, to see the outgoing European Union competition commissioner, Mario Monti, ignoring the new rulebook with such impunity. </p> <p>His declaration at the weekend that a takeover of Abbey National by Spain's Santander \"is a contribution to the objective of the commission of having a more integrated financial services market\" amounts to clear and important price-sensitive information. </p> <p>Common sense may dictate that Santander's bid was unlikely to raise competition concerns but European merger clearance remains an important technical hurdle for the bidder to pass. </p> <p>If such a senior regulator can blurt out such information at a news conference in Italy, why should anyone else bother to follow the rules?</p>",
  "<b> Fithy lucre</b> <br> <b> Invest in some moral interest</b> <br> Unless you're rich, interest isn't an attractive phenomenon. On one side, the plutocrats frolic idly in the sun while their money fattens of itself; on the other, those few little percentage points of interest mean you end up paying a bank \u00a3200,000 over 25 years to be able to buy a \u00a3100,000 house. Yet even those who condemn the practice of making money by lending money admit that we all need a financial leg-up once in a while. \"Everyone knows,\" confessed Pope Benedict XIV in his 1745 encyclical denouncing usury, \"that man is obliged in many instances to help his fellows with a simple, plain loan\". <p>The original Christian prohibition against lending and borrowing money with interest is long buried under an avalanche of plastic rectangles and title deeds, as Britain's collective personal debt of one trillion pounds, and the high street banks' vast profits, attest. The country's 1.8 million Muslims, however, live inside a religion which still holds to the idea that interest is forbidden. </p> <p>Help is at hand. Vice-free banking is coming soon to a branch near you (if you live in north-west London, Leicester or Birmingham, that is), courtesy of a new outfit called the Islamic Bank of Britain plc. The bank got the all-clear from the regulators in August, is now marketing a share offer, and plans to open the doors of its first branch on Edgware Road at the end of this month. </p> <p>Some retail banks in Britain already offer Islamic-style accounts, but Michael Hanlon, managing director of the IBB, says this is the first to be wholly compliant with sharia law. </p> <p>Customers who save with the IBB won't get interest on their accounts, but every month they will get something called \"profits\" added to their nest egg - money which the bank makes by investing in businesses and trading commodities. If you take out a mortgage with the bank, it will buy the home you want, then lease it back to you for a fixed period, after which it belongs to you. The IBB is not allowed to invest in \"unethical\" businesses - tobacco, the drinks trade, arms or pornography. Instead of Vivaldi or generic R&amp;B, the IBB's switchboard offers pious chanting while customers are on hold. </p> <p>Hanlon, a former Barclays man, doesn't feel it's a problem that he, like many of the bank's other senior executives, isn't Muslim. Indeed, he thinks non-Muslims will find the IBB attractive. \"Islamic banking, if nothing else, is heavily ethical, but it is also exceedingly transparent, much more transparent than conventional banking.\" </p> <p>Hanlon says that, according to Islamic teaching, it is every British Muslim's duty to switch to an interest-free bank as soon as one becomes available, and for the time being the only one available happens to be the IBB. But he insists: \"I'm not playing the religious card. We are going to be competitive in terms of product and pricing and are not going to screw the customer on the basis that, from the religious point of view, there isn't an alternative.\"<br> <b>James Meek</b> </p> <p> <b> Secret history</b><br> <b> Taste of our ancestors</b><br> The news that there is to be a museum of cannibalism at the Cheddar Gorge comes as no surprise. Bones of Cheddar folk of the Upper Paleolithic period were found to have gouges in them, suggesting, to those who keep up with these things, sacrifice, butchery and consumption. It is only fair to point out that others feel with equal vehemence that these are signs of a \"defleshing ritual\" before burial rather than an early version of the Atkins diet, but for obvious reasons the local tourist authority has come down on the side of the cannibals. </p> <p>Details of what will go into the museum are still vague. I can't help feeling that there will have to be a section devoted to the story of cannibalism and comparative cannibalistic practices from all over the world. For those with a more practical bent, there might be another section detailing different cooking tech niques and recipes. There will have to be a corner devoted to the more specialised side of dissection, but this will not be much different, one imagines, from Prof Gunther von Hagens' recent Body Worlds exhibition. And there will certainly have to be a leaflet detailing the nutritional values of different body parts (\"take heart: healthy eating the cannibal way\"), with tasting notes by Armin Meiwes. </p> <p>However, it is the museum canteen that seems to me to offer the greatest possibilities for a holistic cannibal experience. After all, just as you might reasonably expect to sample the goods at a dairy producing cheddar cheese,, so no visit to the cannibal museum would be complete without, let us say, a banker-burger (with chips and salad) or surgeon-saveloy. Some might find this a bit in-your-face, so the museum's marketing whizzes might have to come up with more refined menu poetry. Among the islands of the South Seas, Fiji in particular, roasted human was usually known as \"long pig\". Recently, indeed, the Fijians went so far as to apologise to the Baker family for making a \"long pig\" out of one of their ancestors, Reverend Baker: it seems that the Fijians found his missionary position too tempting to resist. The term \"long pig\" says something about the delicacy and flavour of human flesh, and perhaps we could borrow it for such dishes as filet de cochon, cochon a l'orange, carpaccio di porco lungo, fritto misto di porco lungo or petit sal\u00e9 de cochon long au lentille (the healthy option). <br> <b>Matthew Fort</b> </p> <p> <b> Religious studies</b><br> <b> Spare us from artists</b><br> Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is reputed to be home to the highest density of artists in the world; between 1990 and 2000, the median monthly rent in the area increased by 67%, more than anywhere else in New York City.

Now an Italian per fumi\u00e8re , Laura Tonnato, has tried to do justice to the olfactory imagination of some of her favourite authors, concocting five scents to match five odorous moments in classic novels. </p> <p>In a promotion organised by Waterstone's, visitors to the bookseller's Piccadilly branch will, from next week, be able to experience these smells on the five different floors of the store. Keen to investigate this new form of literary appreciation, I obtained review samples, but was warned about the one based on Patrick S\u00fcskind's Perfume, whose protagonist yearns to create the ultimate fragrance: it is designed to catch the pong of 18th-century Paris. </p> <p>First I tried the smell of \"violets that woke the memory of dead romances\" from Oscar Wilde's A Picture of Dorian Gray. This was what perfume should be: sweet, oversweet, a little decadent, perhaps. Appropriate anyway. Then there was \"the smell of burnt juniper\" whose dizzying effects feature in Gabriele d'Annunzio's The Child of Pleasure. It did not make me giddy, but the odour, redolent of bonfires, was pleasing in an autumnal way. Next there was Proust and his famous madeleine. This scent was delicious: vanilla and a hint of home-baking. Only the pedant would object that it is the madeleine's taste, not its smell, that triggers memory in Proust's great novel. </p> <p>Now I was expecting less delight. I opened the spray labelled \"Madame Bovary\", inspired by the frustrated heroine's delight in sniffing the Viscount's cigar case in Flaubert's novel. Emma would \"breathe the scent of its lining - a mixture of tobacco and verbena\", dreaming of the high society from which she was excluded. Tactfully, the volume on the verbena had been turned up, leaving only the faintest whiff of Golden Virginia. Not horrid, even a little evocative. </p> <p>And then came S\u00fcskind. I sprayed on to the cardboard tab supplied what the author describes as \"a stench barely conceivable to us modern men and women\". Hesitantly, lightly, I sniffed. Not so bad. Smoky, perhaps, but perfumish, too. And then it got me. A stomach-yanking undertow that did, for a nauseating moment, make real the ubiquitous reek of decomposition that S\u00fcskind's antihero yearns to escape. A vivid achievement, you have to admit - but will it pull the crowds into Waterstone's? <br> <b>John Mullan</b></p>",
  "The Andalusian economist Tom\u00e1s Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda, who has died aged 93, spent 37 years in exile between the end of the Spanish civil war and the death, in 1975, of the dictator Francisco Franco. A member of the Spanish Communist party (PCE), Garc\u00eda made sacrifices in the resistance; these, and his subsequent willingness to reach historic compromises, contributed to the transition to democracy. <p>During his years in the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Mexico (where he ran the World Federation of Democratic Youth), France and Czechoslovakia, Garc\u00eda became one of the PCE's leading intellectuals, publishing numerous books on politics and agrarian economics, many under the nom de guerre Juan G\u00f3mez. He joined the PCE central committee in 1952, and its executive in 1956. </p> <p>After Franco's death, Garc\u00eda hurried home to play a key backroom role in the Moncloa Palace negotiations that led to free elections to the 1977 constituent assembly. He was elected to represent M\u00e1laga - the constituency that, in 1933, returned Spain's first PCE MP, Cayetano Bol\u00edvar - and combined his work on the new Spanish constitution with responsibility for industry and energy policy in the And- alusian regional administration. Returned to the Madrid parliament in the first democratic election, he continued his pursuit of national reconciliation, making firm friends across the political spectrum. He also pressed for the fuller degree of autonomy that Andalusia won in 1980. </p> <p>Garc\u00eda was born in \u00c1lora, north of M\u00e1laga. He became politically active under the Primo de Rivera dictatorship of the 1920s, and joined the PCE in 1931, while studying for a law degree in Madrid. He then took a doctorate in economics, became a founder of the Communist Youth and was close to the literary circle around Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and Rafael Alberti. </p> <p>Appointed to the civil service under the second Spanish republic, Garc\u00eda remained loyal to the government during Franco's revolt, and ended up in a camp in France before beginning his long exile. </p> <p>After he retired from public life in 1982, a family inheritance enabled him to create an educational charity for disadvantaged students in his beloved \u00c1lora, where the public library bears his name. He retired to the picturesque village of Alcauc\u00edn, in M\u00e1laga province, where he died at home. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Teresa Azc\u00e1rate, two daughters and a son. </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Tom\u00e1s Garc\u00eda Garc\u00eda, economist and politician, born 1911; died August 9 2004</p>",
  "A white Italian couple are demanding compensation after the woman gave birth to twins with dark skin following fertility treatment. <p>The public hospital in Modena where three couples received treatment on the day in question has opened an internal inquiry to determine whether the fertilised eggs of two couples were switched before being implanted, or whether the Italian woman's eggs were fertilised with the wrong sperm, as the clinic chief, Annibale Volpe, fears.</p> <p>Recent DNA tests have confirmed that the biological father of the twins, born about four years ago, is a north African man.</p> <p>\"Clearly a dirty pipette which had already been used was not thrown away,\" the newspaper Repubblica quoted Dr Volpe as saying. \"We used it a second time and there must have been a few sperm left behind by the previous couple.\"</p> <p>The case comes 18 months after a similar incident in Britain in which a couple ended up adopting the child they had started to bring up, despite the fact that it was not biologically theirs.</p> <p>The Italian case is one of a handful of such \"test-tube mix-ups\" on record, but has sparked a heated debate about legal parentage, children's rights and medical negligence in a relatively new but increasingly sought-after area of medicine.</p> <p>The news comes days after the newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that a hospital in Turin had given two couples the morning-after pill half an hour after inseminating each woman with the wrong man's sperm. One couple reportedly noticed by chance that the sperm sample used had another man's name on it. They will not know for about a week whether the women have conceived.</p> <p>A prosecutor in Turin, Raffaele Guariniello, is reportedly investigating the standards of practice at the Promea clinic in the city after reports said that a secretary had been \"helping out\" on the day that the sperm samples were muddled.</p> <p>Fertility experts have called for understanding, arguing that human error is inevitable and that overall the recorded number of such mistakes worldwide has been minimal.</p> <p>\"The error must be taken into account, but I would not cry scandal,\" Carlo Flamigni, the president of the Bologna-based Italian Society for Fertility and Sterility, told the daily Corriere della Sera. \"When a technique has been perfected and becomes routine, you must only expect that attention levels drop. It's the risk of our daily work, not just for doctors, but for every other profession.\"</p> <p>In Italy, the apparent laboratory blunders have fuelled the debate over a controversial new law which introduced tight restrictions on fertility treatment last March. Previously Italy had been without any legislation in this area, earning it a reputation as the \"wild west\" of fertility treatment.</p> <p>The Italian health minister, Girolamo Sirchia, said the reported mistakes were further evidence that this field of medicine needed tight regulation: \"These errors show that anything can happen if you do not have rules,\" he told journalists.</p> <p>Critics of the law - which bans research on embryos and limits fertility treatment to stable, heterosexual couples using their own eggs and sperm - are scrambling to collect sufficient signatures by September 30 to force a referendum on the issue.</p> <p>In the February 2003 case in Britain, a senior female judge, Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, ruled that a white couple could adopt its two black children, despite the fact that their biological father was a black man.</p> <p>In a case in New York in 1999, however, a similar couple were ordered to return the boy to its biological parents.</p> <p>In what is said to be the only other recorded case of a test-tube mix-up, a woman in the Netherlands had treatment and gave birth to twins with different fathers in 1997.</p> <p>One was her husband's child and the other was not. The woman was allowed to keep both children.</p>",

  "<p>Doom and desperation are frequently the building blocks of Mark Lanegan's music, but he's looking pretty good on it. Lean, lined and exuding San Quentin-style ruggedness, Lanegan stands motionless at the microphone growling out his lyrics in a subterranean baritone, like Lee Marvin nursing a Jack Daniel's hangover and a Jim Morrison fixation. Except that Lanegan's favourite mood-modifiers have tended to be heroin and crack, leading him into brushes with the law and the kind of scenarios recounted in When Your Number Isn't Up, the opening song on his fine new album, sardonically entitled Bubblegum. </p> <p>However, there's more to creating Lanegan's dark, splintered sound than meets the eye: tonight, outside the finely tuned laboratory of the studio, some of the required components have gone missing. On disc, the lyrics being ground out by his dark and slatey voice emerge pretty clearly, and Lanegan draws you in as the compellingly existential narrator of his own rock-noir fables. In the Academy - a claustrophobic, airless box tucked away in a shopping arcade, where you can swelter in the crush downstairs or go upstairs and watch the act on a TV - his voice melts down into a feral mumble, a mere component in the band's total sound rather than its focal point. Since the stage is lit - barely - in sepulchral green or muted ultra-violet, and Lanegan is careful never to tread anywhere near a spotlight, the performance takes on a weird feeling of anonymity. </p> <p>Hence, the point of much of his band's work is dissipated, although there's still much to admire in some carefully wrought interplay between guitarists Brett Netson and Michael Barragan, with spiralling acid-filigrees springboarding off grunting chords and stark riffs. Lanegan cranks his squad up to a storming finale with Methamphetamine Blues, leaving the stage to let the musicians find their own conclusion. But overall, a bit of a waste.</p>",
  "There is nothing quite so synonymous with the wobbling sets and unconvincing \"special\" effects of British television sci-fi as the BBC Radiophonic Workshop which was formed in 1958 to provide \"sound treatments\" for radio programmes. One of the workshop's early pioneers - Desmond Briscoe - was a man who'd made his name as the chap behind the sounds of exploding stomachs on The Goon Show. Quite an admission on anybody's CV. <p>From such humble beginnings, the workshop's portfolio expanded to include its best-known work: Doctor Who. Early recordings made use of some innovative techniques, including the bashing of copper water tanks and the rolling of pebbles inside boxes. The Doctor Who theme tune became a classic, while its other groundbreaking work was the noise that heralded the appearance and disappearance of the Tardis. Composed to reflect the material fabric of space being slowly ripped apart and dissolved into an oscillating ether stream (or something like that), it was in fact the noise of a key being scraped across piano wire that set your teeth on edge and hurt your fillings. </p> <p>The workshop was innovative in its use of electronic music and rudimentary synthesizers long before they became de rigueur for a new breed of pop bands in the late 1970s. Its sound, imperceptibly, was thrust into the background of millions of British lives in shows such as John Craven's Newsround, Tomorrow's World and Blake's 7. </p> <p>For many of us thirty-to-fiftysomethings, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop was the sound of our childhood. Not quite up there in the rock'n'roll stakes with The Who (academic sorts in brown cords and elbow patches bashing on xylophones aren't quite Roger Daltrey, it has to be said), but memorable all the same.</p>",
  "<p>By sunset every day, dozens of men, poor workers, students and state employees gather under a bridge on the riverbank. There are piles of rubbish around them, pipes pumping sewage into the river and a huge column of black smoke rising from a power plant across the river. This is the site for Baghdad's most famous speakeasy. </p> <p>This secret hideout for the city's drinkers, one of many, opened back in the 90s. After a glorious victory in the Mother of all Battles against the Americans in '91, the Great Leader decided to offer something to the god of piety, so with a huge mosque under construction he issued a holy edict banning all public drinking. </p> <p>In one of the very few acts of defiance, people gathered in car parks and under bridge flyovers, as if all their cars had broken down mysteriously and simultaneously in the same place, and sip beer all night. </p> <p>Sixteen months after the toppling of the Great Leader, public drinking is still considered haram, especially with all the ayatollahs running the government and their militias roaming the streets. And yet the speakeasy is flourishing. </p> <p>Today cars park on both sides of the river; some with up to four boxes of iced beer in the boot. Since the Americans removed the liquor tax, drinking has become a more proletarian act: one can of Dutch beer costs no more than 30p. </p> <p>A Christian man selling olives, chips and hummus with lime and mustard from a table on the roadside started telling me about the difficulties of his job. \"Things are much better since the police started patrolling this area,\" he said. </p> <p>\"So they are harassing you any more?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"No. They used to harass us, but not any more. Now they just come here every half an hour and take some food and iced beer from us.\" </p> <p>It is the Mahdi army that they really fear. \"They attack us every few days, throwing hand grenades or just shooting at us.\" </p> <p>Three young men were sitting there drinking beer the other day. \"Are you still chasing clashes in Sadr city?\" one asked me. </p> <p>\"Not since the ceasefire,\" I replied, completely puzzled. </p> <p>\"Yeah, you used to come to our post before. We used to fire RPGs from behind the fire station. But no pictures here,\" he said, pointing at my camera. </p> <p>At this point I was slightly freaking out, wondering if this was a Mahdi army scout team. But the boys seemed relaxed and half drunk. </p> <p>\"We are taking a break now from all the fighting of the last few months, but do come and visit us,\" the fighter said, with a big grin on his face. </p> <p>As I was planning to leave a man wearing a white keffiyeh and dishdasha approached me. \"Are you a journalist?\" he asked in a very thick Ramadi accent. OK, I thought, here is the real muj who is here to blow himself up. </p> <p>\"Yeyyyss, I am a journalist,\" I replied, shaking. </p> <p>\"OK. I want to convey my message to the world and to the French people,\" he said. \"Please tell the world that the people of Ramadi are not all crazy mujahideen, and that we want all the French hostages to be freed, and that we definitely enjoy beer.\" </p> <p>And then he walked away, an empty beer can swinging in his hand, to buy a new one. </p> <p>The under-the-bridge speakeasy is not the only one. In the middle of Karrada Street, three empty beer boxes are propped on the pavement. It's one of the signs of a speakeasy. I found it in a side street 50m away, a young man in a tracksuit sat at the door. </p> <p>\"Is there any ... ahhhh ... ?\" </p> <p>\"Any what?\" he answered, with a weary look on his eyes. </p> <p>\"The empty boxes?\" </p> <p>He looked around, and then at my beard. \"Why?\" </p> <p>\"I want to buy some.\" </p> <p>\"OK. Come on.\" </p> <p>He led me to a completely empty shop, at the back of which was a door, through which we entered another shop. There, a few men were sitting on plastic chairs drinking beer. It was dark inside and really hot. </p> <p>\"The militia attacked our liquor shop, so we closed it and opened this bar instead. We are making more money now.\"</p>",

Among the groups lined up as potential buyers for parts of the Co-op businesses were J Sainsbury and Allied Irish Bank. </p> <p>Shares in Lancia soared as support for the bid grew but collapsed abruptly after private detectives shot video footage of Mr Regan receiving internal Co-op documents in a pub car park from the Co-op's then retail controller, Allan Green. A high court judge later concluded that the conduct of Mr Regan and Mr Green had been \"the clearest case of a gross, wilful and disgraceful breach of confidence\". He described the two as \"patently dishonest\". </p> <p>Scrutiny of Mr Regan's relationship with Mr Green led to both men being charged in relation to a bribery scandal two years earlier, when Mr Regan was running a food manufacturing firm that supplied Co-op stores. Mr Green and a second Co-op executive were both sentenced to jail two years ago for each taking a \u00a31m bribe in exchange for securing a lucrative exclusive supply contract extension for Mr Regan's company. Mr Regan, whose lawyers told the court he knew nothing of any bribes, was finally acquitted a year ago after sitting through three trials. </p> <p>He has kept a low profile but continued to be an active investor for the last seven years.

  "Israel is pressing foreign donors to finance the construction of a web of roads through the occupied territories - made necessary by the building of the vast \"security\" barrier and Jewish settlements in the West Bank. <p>The Israeli government seeks foreign funding to upgrade the back roads that Palestinians are forced to use - after being banned from routes used by Jewish settlers. </p> <p>It also wants funding to build new roads which take account of the barrier and its settlements. The plan envisages roads that would run parallel to each other - one for Jews, the other for Arabs. </p> <p>European donors have recoiled from the proposal, in part because they are concerned that funding the new roads will breach July's International Court of Justice ruling against support for construction of the barrier. The court said it should be torn down because it breaches the Geneva conventions. </p> <p>But diplomats say the US may be more willing to pay, given Washington's tacit endorsement of the barrier and support for Ariel Sharon's latest plan to expand West Bank settlements while withdrawing settlers from Gaza. </p> <p>\"What European donors are not prepared to do is to fund anything that assists the wall or the settlements. The Americans are more flexible,\" said one European diplomat. </p> <p>Officials say the request was made last month at meetings with the World Bank after foreign pressure to ease up on the movement of Palestinians. </p> <p>The meetings came in the wake of a World Bank report on the repercussions of Mr Sharon's plan to unilaterally withdraw settlers from the Gaza strip and four West Bank colonies while reinforcing Israel's control over other parts of the occupied territories. </p> <p>The World Bank called for Israel to allow much greater freedom of movement by Palestinians to help revive the Palestinian economy. </p> <p>Israel said it was interested in \"improving the transportation infrastructure to enable uninterrupted movement across the West Bank\" but that it would require \"extensive and complex construction with international assistance.\" </p> <p>\"We're already heavily subsidising the occupation and that worries us,\" said a foreign diplomat. \"We are prepared to help where it means building or reconstructing the Palestinian infrastructure. But there is a lot of concern among the donors that the Israelis think we will just pick up the bill for their actions, whether it's sending tanks into Jenin and Rafah or building the wall.\" </p> <p>Foreign diplomats say that any request for improving roads should come from the Palestinian Authority - which has already requested assistance to repair damage done by Israeli tanks but not necessarily in the areas around the barrier and settlements. </p> <p>Some donors are also worried about the creation of a separate road network for Arabs that one Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, has described as a form of apartheid. </p> <p>B'Tselem says Israel bars from, or restricts Palestinians on, more than 700km of roads in the West Bank. The Israeli military describes roads from which Palestinians are banned as \"sterile\", a term some critics say has racial overtones . </p> <p>B'Tselem said in a recent report that Israel's roads policy in the occupied territories causes \"harsh, extensive, indiscriminate, and prolonged harm to the local population\". </p> <p>\"By unlawfully discriminating against Palestinians, the Forbidden Roads Regime is reminiscent of the apartheid system that existed in South Africa. The regime violates fundamental principles of international law that are binding on Israel,\" the report says.</p>",
  "The Croatian painter and politician Ivan Lackovic Croata, who has died aged 72, began to add the pseudonym \"Croata\" in 1964, when his country was part of Yugoslavia. As a \"naive\" artist from a peasant background, he became a hero of the socialist state while in his thirties. By this time he was already nursing strong nationalist feelings, which could not be fully expressed until Croatia gained its independence in 1992. There is a strong patriotic mood in all of his work, particularly in the vivid winter landscapes celebrating the beauty of his homeland for which he is best known. <p>Lackovic was born in Batinska, a village in the lush Drava valley, north-east of Zagreb. His parents Terezija and Vid had had little education, and their son left school to become a labourer at the age of 12. Soon, he began to paint on glass, a popular material in the folk art of the Balkans, as well as on the walls of neighbours' houses, using whitewash thinned with milk. </p> <p>His talents were discovered by Dragutin Ancic, a teacher, who took him to Zagreb in 1957. It was in the city's Gallery of Primitive Art that Lackovic first encountered the works of the Hlebine School, a group of naive painters in northern Croatia, led since 1932 by the charismatic Krsto Hegedusic. Lackovic's experience of their luminous rural scenes was an epiphany, and he moved to Zagreb shortly afterwards with his wife, Ana, and two-year-old son. </p> <p>Success was not immediate. Until 1968 Lackovic was a postman, but, after meeting Hegedusic in 1962, he began to attract more attention, having his first one-man show two years later, at the Yugoslav Academy of Arts and Sciences in Zagreb. </p> <p>Initially, Lackovic was recognised for his graphic art, at which he excelled. His book illustrations, prints and drawings - often biblical or mythological narratives, The Apocalypse, Nineveh, Eros and Thanatos - are bold, sometimes almost abstract, compositions. Such events as the deaths of stars become vibrant doodles, while Christian images are given the immediacy of a mystic vision. </p> <p> Lackovic's paintings, however, are less successful, often looking like faintly sinister Christmas cards: winter light gleams sickly through leafless trees while peasants throw snowballs or labour in the ice. Sometimes Pegasus drops by, all aflame, or a clump of brilliant blue flowers wildly sheds its blossom. Grotesque as they may be, such pictures undoubtedly expressed a sincere longing for, in Lackovic's words, a \"harmony of man and nature\". He added: \"I have given man a special place in nature, I have elevated him to the throne by making him part of nature itself ... The humans in my paintings are sustained by the melancholy colours of spring, summer, autumn and winter.\" </p> <p>This sympathy with the countryside also had a religious dimension. In 1969 Lackovic depicted a village laid like an offering on an altar, while in Man With A Rooster a peasant's journey across the snow, lit by the setting sun, is a metaphor for human mortality. </p> <p>Rather than seeming hopelessly out-of-date, Lackovic's work became even more relevant in the newly independent Croatia. Whatever the realities of modern life, Lackovic provided his compatriots with imagery that they could recognise not only as resolutely Catholic but also as distinctly Croatian. Moreover, in the 1990s such paintings as The Eyes Of Truth clearly referred to the sufferings caused by the Yugoslavian war. </p> <p>Lackovic's popularity was confirmed by his election, on two occasions, as a member of his country's recently established parliament. He was active politically and artistically right up to his sudden death - while bicycling at a sports centre in Zagreb. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Ana, and their children Ivan and Ivana. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> Ivan Lackovic Croata, artist and politician, born January 1 1932; died August 29 2004</p>",
  "The small group of middle-aged women waiting patiently outside Tonbridge train station in Kent looked unlikely extremists. As a white minibus pulled up and the group, exchanging jolly remarks about the weather, climbed on board, few of the early morning shoppers gave them a second glance. <p>But these women are all frontline activists in the animal rights battle, where Dutch anarchists who boast about breaking into police stations and stealing official records work alongside elderly English women who \"only care about the animals\", run weekly stalls and take \"little interest in politics\". </p> <p>This weekend, more than 300 leading anti-vivisection campaigners from Europe and the United States gathered in Kent for what was dubbed an \"activists' training camp\". </p> <p>The three-day event at a private animal sanctuary 10 miles from Tonbridge, which offered workshops on strategy and tactics, \"hunt sabbing\", self defence and personal security, was shrouded in secrecy. </p> <p>Activists were instructed to call a mobile phone number advertised on the internet when they arrived at the train station and wait for further instructions. Personal mobiles had to be left at the entrance to the site and campaigners were warned to be on the lookout for undercover police and journalists - who were banned from the site apart from a two-hour press briefing on Sunday morning. </p> <p>The warnings were clearly justified: a Guardian reporter attended the event by posing as an activist to find out exactly what strategy and tactics were being discussed in the closed sessions. </p> <p>\"OK, who's the infiltrator?\" asked the driver as the minibus pulled away. \"It's not me,\" joked one of the women. \"I've come along to find out how to make bombs, or at least how to kick a copper properly, I always end up hurting my foot!\" </p> <p>There has been growing concern in recent months about the activities of the militant wing of the movement. The home secretary, David Blunkett, has announced new powers to prevent activists protesting outside the homes of laboratory employees. </p> <p>He also banned the US surgeon and animal rights activist Jarry Vlasak, who has claimed the assassination of scientists working in biomedical research would save millions of animals' lives, from visiting Britain for the event. </p> <p>\"I think it's an outrage,\" said Mary, one of the minibus passengers. \"They let that Muslim preacher in, but not Jarry. They are scared because what he is saying is the truth.\" </p> <p>In the main tent a lecturer on personal security warned his audience that the police were probably bugging their homes and advised anyone wanting to discuss \"private plans\" to do so away from the conference site. He told them to avoid meeting in pubs, which could be bugged, and advised them to burn rather than shred their mail. </p> <p>The speaker added: \"There is a massive difference between security and paranoia but if you are involved, as we all are, in animal rights activities, assume your phone has been tapped and that you are being watched.\" </p> <p>He was not far wrong. A member of the audience who had been spotted taking copious notes was taken to one side and quizzed about his background. His undercover persona may have been undermined by the fact that he was using shorthand and asking questions about bombmaking and other extreme tactics. As he was being grilled and the activists were getting more jumpy, the Guardian beat a dignified retreat to the cafe. </p> <p>For all the organisers' reassurances that the training camp was solely about legal protest, the more extreme elements of the movement were also there - and clearly had the support of many of the activists. </p> <p>A member of the militant Animal Liberation Front, dressed in shorts and T-shirt, drew the largest round of applause when he said: \"What we need is more people who are prepared to put on balaclavas and go out in the middle of the night and take real action, because this is what has raised our profile, that is why we are getting the media attention. </p> <p>\"There are 20 or so people who carry the direct action movement in this country and most of them are here now. But the police know who we are and watch us - this isn't a problem, I've been to prison, I've still got the bottle. But there are people here who I don't know and who I'm sure the police don't know who could do what they want - get away with murder.\" </p> <p>Activists were told the decision to tar get individual companies involved - however tangentially - in vivisection was paying off. </p> <p>\"In the 1980s we turned up for a demonstration outside one company one week then another the next, never putting them under sustained pressure. Now, with organisations like Shac [Stop Huntingdon Life Sciences] and Speak [campaigning against an animal research laboratory in Oxford] we are unrelenting in our pursuit of one organisation and we are winning,\" said one speaker. </p> <p>Other campaigners questioned the direct action tactics of \"home visits\" - where employees of companies are targeted outside work, often having their cars attacked or properties damaged. </p> <p>\"But that is what works,\" replied another. \"I have organised about 20 demonstrations without any interest from the press whatsoever. As soon as we had our first direct action, the phone never stopped ringing with the media asking for interviews. I don't make the rules but that is how it works.\" </p> <p>Greg Avery, the founder of Shac, told the gathering the movement was more successful now than at any stage in its history. He said once the battle against individual companies had been won the movement needed to move into a revolutionary new phase and take on whole sectors of the \"vivisection industry\". </p> <p>But among the rank and file, there were differences of opinion on how the battle should be fought. At the sanctuary, anarchists from Germany and the Netherlands, who dressed in black and wore T-shirts emblazoned with slogans such as \"Fuck Authority\" and \"Global Resistance and Revolution,\" mixed with neatly turned-out women from middle England. </p> <p>\"In the end it is all about the animals, not about us, we mean nothing,\" said an English woman who ran a stall every weekend in her local high street handing out leaflets. </p> <p>The black-clad anarchist from Hamburg was not so sure. \"My life and yours are worth just as much as any animal's. What we are fighting is not just animal abuse at individual companies, but about many things - sexism, racism and oppression and the wider capitalist system.\" </p> <p>But one thing that united all activists was the shared conviction that their cause was a righteous one. Speakers repeatedly likened the movement to the anti-apartheid campaign and the fight against the slave trade, with the media blamed for presenting the activists as extremists. </p> <p>\"Look at the newspapers when those movements were at their peak and there will be the same terms bandied around as there are about us now,\" one said. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Labour's seven years of vacillating over a ban on foxhunting will finally end this week when the government announces on Thursday that the Parliament Act will be used to force the measure on to the statute book by mid-October. </p> <p>A debate is however continuing on how quickly the ban will be brought into force, with the possibility that hunts will be given as long as two years to wind down and ensure staff and dogs are found alternative employment.</p>",
  "<p>Hot from the Edinburgh Fringe, Conall Morrison's one-man play for Dublin's Storytellers Company seeks to explore the political, religious and sexual contradictions of Northern Irish life. It's vividly written and virtuosically performed by S\u00e9an Kearns - but there are times when you feel Morrison is like a man trying to cram the contents of an entire wardrobe into a single suitcase. </p> <p>The simile is apt because the stage is littered with old clothes, the contents of a Belfast family attic to which John Foster, a one-time dirty tricks specialist with the British security forces, has returned. As he surveys the detritus of his past, Foster dons the garb of his ancestors and transforms into his grandfather, who was a firebrand Protestant lay preacher, and then his print-frocked mother, a devout Catholic. Although passionately rejecting his mixed religious inheritance, Foster seems inescapably shaped by it. </p> <p>This, to me, is the play's problem: Morrison never forges a direct link between Foster's muddied spiritual background and his role as a counterintelligence officer. Where the play scores is in its re-creation of Foster's murky professional activities: he turned a stray dog into a nationally admired military mascot, supervised the use of laundry vans as surveillance spy-holes and \"ran\" a double-agent who turned on his operator, with lethal results. </p> <p>Morrison gets a superb performance from Kearns, a tall, angst-ridden figure who, in his feverish ransacking of the past and constant donning of ancestral clothes, seems a restless man in search of an identity. Even if the character is too much of a special case to become a national metaphor, you end up awed by Kearns's performance. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until September 26.

  "The work and pensions secretary, Andrew Smith, has resigned from his cabinet post, Downing Street confirmed tonight. <p>In a letter to Tony Blair, the 53-year-old Mr Smith said he was leaving frontline politics to spend more time with his family.</p> <p>However, his name had been repeatedly cited as one of the jobs up for grabs in a cabinet reshuffle, now expected later this week.</p> <p>Mr Smith was appointed to the top job in the Department for Work and Pensions in 2002 after having served as a junior education minister and chief secretary to the Treasury. </p> <p>He was seen as a \"safe pair of hands\" but was criticised by some observers for a lack of flair and a failure to make an impact on the increasingly sensitive issue of pensions. </p> <p>In his letter of resignation, Mr Smith said: \"Over the summer, I have discussed with my family the contribution I wish to make in public life. </p> <p>\"I have chosen to leave the government and to devote more time to the responsibilities I enjoy in my constituency and to my family.\" </p> <p>He added: \"I am grateful to you for the opportunity to have served and for your having asked me to stay on. I have, though, come to this decision after careful thought and my mind is settled.\" </p> <p>In his letter of reply, Mr Blair praised Mr Smith as \"an excellent colleague and a first-class minister who will be greatly missed\". </p> <p>He wrote: \"I am sorry that you have taken the decision to resign from the government. As you say in your letter, I very much wanted you to stay, but I accept that your mind is made up.\" </p> <p>Mr Smith was seen as an ally of Mr Brown in the cabinet, although his low-key demeanour and poor speaking skills meant he was never one of the more recognisable faces of the government.</p> <p>However, the vacancy in the cabinet could now offer a new berth to the current party chairman, Ian McCartney, tipped today to lose his job to the former health secretary Alan Milburn, who also left his job to spend more time with his family last year.</p> <p>Mr Smith, the MP for Oxford East, was best known for a rousing speech at the 1996 Blackpool Labour conference where he told delegates - just six months before the general election - that \"our is not for sale\".</p> <p>The soundbite came back to haunt him when one of the Labour's government's early actions was to part-privatise national air traffic control.</p> <p>Pensions, as a policy issue, is quickly rising up the political agenda with a lobby of parliament by current pensioners this Wednesday.</p> <p>The Conservatives also intend to make it one of their key themes of attack on the government, and with the government warning that today's generation of school leavers may have to work on into their 70s to support themselves, it may be that Mr Blair thought he needed a more charismatic performer to handle the pensions brief.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman, Steve Webb, said: \"Andrew Smith's period in office will be remembered as one when the crises in company pensions grew unchecked, where mass means-testing was the order of the day and the pensions system became more complicated than ever. </p> <p>\"The new secretary of state needs to reverse the drive towards means-testing, restore confidence in company pensions and radically simplify the whole pensions system. </p> <p>The Public and Commercial Services Union, which has been involved in bitter disputes with Mr Smith all year over pay and jobs said it hoped the new minister would \"champion\" the work of the department as well as its staff. </p> <p>The union's general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: \"We hope the new minister will engage with the unions, sit down with us and sort out problems surrounding pay and uncertainty for all staff concerning job cuts.\"</p> <p>Mr Smith won the marginal seat of Oxford East for Labour in 1987, a victory which heralded the start of Labour's comeback among the southern working-class voters which had been lost to them in the Thatcher years. </p> <p>Before his election, he worked for the Oxford and Swindon Cooperative Society as member relations officer, and for the Open University as a tutor. </p> <p>He served as a councillor on Oxford City Council from 1976 to 1987. He narrowly lost Oxford East in a tight battle in 1983 but came back to win the seat four years later. </p> <p>In opposition he served as shadow higher education minister as well as in the Treasury and transport frontbench teams. </p> <p>When Labour stormed to power in 1997, Mr Smith was made minister of state for employment, welfare to work and equal opportunities. </p> <p>He joined the cabinet in 1999 as chief secretary to the Treasury, helping the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to construct three annual budgets. </p> <p>It was in May 2002 that he became secretary of state at the Department for Work and Pensions, which replaced the old Department for Social Security. </p> <p>He was born on February 1, 1951 and educated at Reading School and St John's College, Oxford.</p>",
  "<p>Alarm bells are ringing in Russian media circles after the alleged poisoning of Anna Politkovskaya, one of the most outspoken critics of Vladimir Putin's policy on Chechnya, and the apparent sacking of the editor of Izvestia today.</p> <p>Politkovskaya, who writes for the current affairs magazine Novaya Gazeta, was on her way to the siege in Beslan from Moscow when she collapsed mysteriously.</p> <p>According to the Moscow Times today, \"Politkovskaya was flying from Vnukovo Airport to Rostov-on-Don and fainted on the plane. Immediately after landing, she was taken to a local hospital, where doctors found she had been poisoned, Novaya Gazeta editor Dmitry Muratov told the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.\"</p> <p>Muratov said Politkovskaya had not eaten anything that day and that she felt sick after drinking tea on the plane. He did not speculate on who might have poisoned her. Politkovskaya is now recovering in a Moscow clinic.</p> <p>Politkovskaya has written repeatedly about Russia's brutal war in Chechnya, much to the fury of the Putin regime. She claims to have seen video footage that shows Chechen prisoners being treated the same way as those in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq but says no Russian TV channel would show it. When her paper published pictures no other papers followed up the story.</p> <p>Earlier this year she accused the rest of the Russian media of acting as black propaganda agencies.</p> <p>Ironically though, Novaya Gazeta condemned the hostage-takers almost as fiercely as those with no time for the Chechen separatist cause.</p> <p>The allegation that she was poisoned with the intention of preventing her from covering the Beslan siege comes as the Russian media has been hit by two other strange incidents - the sacking of the editor of Izvestia and the detention of another prominent journalist who was trying to cover the siege.</p> <p>Radio reporter Andrei Babitsky was prevented from reaching Beslan after he was arrested and sentenced to five day's jail for \"hooliganism\" at an airport after he was provoked into a fight.</p> <p>He had been trying to catch a flight at Vnukuvo airport and had already been detained by police, who searched for explosives in his bag.</p> <p>The incidents happened in the middle of last week as the panic-stricken Russians tried to play down the siege, claiming there were as few as 300 people in the school.</p> <p>Together with today's apparent sacking of Izvestia's editor, Raf Shakirov, in the wake of graphic accounts of the disaster in Saturday's newspaper, they represent an alarming development for those fighting to maintain a free press in Russia.</p> <p><strong>TV channels censored school siege</strong><br> The horrific events at the end of last week have sharpened complaints that the Russian media is either unable or unwilling to do its job properly.</p> <p>Restrained and allegedly biased TV coverage of Friday's drama sparked an outcry in certain corners of the country's press, with some commentators - including Izvestia's Irina Petrovskaya - angry that Russia's three main channels hesitated to show live footage from the besieged school and then kept their reporting cautious and unquestioning.</p> <p>When it came to covering the unfolding tragedy on Friday, two of Russia's main TV channels did not mention what was happening in Beslan until an hour after explosions were first heard at the school.</p> <p>State-owned Rossia TV and Channel One broke their silence at 2pm - with Channel One returning to a serial of \"Women in Love\" just 10 minutes later.</p> <p>On Rossia, an hour-long news bulletin \"downplayed\" what was happening, according to Russian press reports, before returning to the \"Red Chapel\" spy series.</p> <p>Only on NTV, which is owned by state-controlled company Gazprom, was there rolling coverage - for three hours - even though it had started late, at 1.30pm.</p> <p>Until then, only viewers with access to BBC World, CNN or EuroNews had been able to see pictures of semi-naked and wounded children bursting out of the school as occasional explosions and bursts of gunfire could be heard in the background. </p> <p>The apparent timidity of the TV channels may well have been influenced by the precedent of the Dubrovka theatre siege in October 2002, when NTV was criticised with claims it jeopardised the mission to save the people held captive inside the building. </p> <p>In the end, 129 hostages and 41 terrorists died following a botched attempt to bring the siege to an end involving a lethal dose of gas being pumped into the theatre by Russian forces.</p> <p>This time NTV reported government statements without making any additional comments, as it had done during its coverage of the theatre siege. </p> <p>NTV has paid the price for outspokenness: a few months after the theatre siege, its general director, Boris Jordan, lost his job.</p> <p>More recently, two prominent presenters were taken off air in controversial circumstances.</p> <p>In July, Savik Shuster, host of the highly rated Svoboda Slova (Free Speech) television programme was relieved of his duties less than a week after criticising politicians for refusing to debate new social legislation.</p> <p>A month earlier Leonid Parfyonov, a well-known satirist, was taken off air for trying to broadcast an interview with the widow of the slain Chechen leader, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev.</p> <p>NTV, formerly owned by the media tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, was taken over by the state-controlled company Gazprom in 2001 after Mr Gusinsky sold the network and fled to Israel. </p> <p>The last fully independent channel, TVS, was shut down and replaced with a sports channel last year.</p> <p>The reason given for the closure was the station's financial problems, but critics of the Kremlin pointed to its timing, a few months before the elections which saw Mr Putin given his second term as president.</p> <p>But while the broadcasters appear to be controlled to varying degrees by the government, the press has shown greater vigour in questioning the official version of events.</p> <p>A number of newspapers have poured scorn on the security authorities for failing to protect the public and have also explicitly linked the terrorist outrage in Beslan with the failure of Russian military involvement in Chechnya. </p> <p>Accusing the government of lying, some papers are viewing claims that Arab terrorists were involved as a smokescreen to diminish the government's culpability.</p> <p>The Saturday issue of privately-owned Izvestia featured shocking pictures of wounded and dead children and other victims of the hostage crisis. </p> <p>Columnist Irina Petrovskaya was openly critical of the TV coverage. \"My God, how our valiant state television stations took fright and lost their heads,\" she wrote.</p> <p>Izvestia was one of the first Russian media outlets to cast doubt on the government's now disproved claim that only about 350 hostages were being held captive in the school - less than a third of the actual number.</p> <p>Now it seems Mr Shakirov may have lost his job over the line his paper took.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Recent times have seen major improvements in all aspects of our lives - there has been a rise in standards of health, sportsmen and women continue to push the boundaries of physical achievement and technology has revolutionised the way we live our lives. There is no reason that education should be excluded from this list, however, for many this is not the perception and there is a tendency to look back to a 'golden age' in education. At times there appears to be a relentless campaign to undermine the teaching profession, focusing on failings rather than achievements. This has created three problems.</p> <p>The first problem is the result of a period of unprecedented government intervention in education. The strategy has been to determine all that is best and proselytise, cajole or even impose those ideas. The outcome of this approach is that we now have a highly prescribed curriculum, frequent assessment of pupils and accountability systems that are complex, expensive and unfair. Such a degree of central control has had a marked effect on teachers' morale. </p> <p>Being in control is one of the keys to human happiness. As David Myers, professor of psychology at Hope College in the US noted in his book 'The Pursuit of Happiness' 'when workers have more control their job satisfaction rises'. For the professional teacher autonomy, self-determination and responsiveness to the particular needs of pupils is important. I am not advocating total deregulation and have no doubt we need a framework of principles and guidelines, concepts and skills to ensure all pupils gain access to a broad, balanced and relevant curriculum. What I am talking about is professional discretion and responsibility - being able to choose to do the right thing. </p> <p>Well-implemented strategies, for example for literacy and numeracy, can be very effective but there is a need for flexibility. There is a difference between being compelled to follow the strategy and being able to determine what is in the pupils' best interest. </p> <p>If you tell people what they must do, at first they might resist and then once they comply there is a danger that they will become de-skilled -responsibility for their actions lies elsewhere. And if the strategy is not perfect then it fails. </p> <p>The wise teacher will pay due regard to advice and guidance, but they have to make their own sense of it. The problem is that once this freedom has been taken away, trust and confidence are lost. It is hard to re-establish the passion, dynamism and creativity that we would like to see in our schools once a cycle of dependency has been created.</p> <p>The second problem is that the views of those who take the big picture overview and many within the teaching profession are increasingly at odds with the government's emphasis on the basics. Clearly, we all agree that being literate, numerate and competent using a computer is important but it is clear that much is being sacrificed on the altar of the basics. </p> <p>There is now some recognition of this problem. However, whilst being exhorted to offer a more wide-ranging and enjoyable curriculum, schools continue to face the twin pressures of Ofsted and league tables with their focus on the high-status, high-stakes assessment. Therefore, we should not be surprised that this is what teachers spend most of their time on. This narrow, 'Gradgrind' educational experience does not sit comfortably with teachers' knowledge of the needs of their pupils and their views on the wider purposes of education.</p> <p>The third problem is that teachers are one of the targets to carry the blame for the perceived ills of society. Bad press doesn't help, although I don't suggest that the teaching profession should be above media criticism. Yet the sheer number of people involved, the subject matter and the fact that we all went to school and often have a romantic and rosy view of the past can make the reaction to negative stories in the press so dangerously emotional. There can be no doubt of the long-term damage this can do to individuals and the nation as a whole. </p> <p>Teachers are often blamed by sections of the press and parents for unruly children. Yet these are often the same parents who threaten teachers, verbally, physically or in court when they try to discipline their children. The reality is that children are in school for 17% of their time. They spend 33% in bed and this leaves 50% for their parents, peers and television. We all have our role to play and must all share the responsibility rather than divert attention from our failings by blaming others. In the relatively small amount of time they have teachers do an extraordinary job. </p> <p>We live in a noisy and challenging world. For the vast majority of children school is an oasis of calm order and purposeful learning. We cannot rush back to the past, nor should we want to. There was no golden age in education. We have seen huge social, economic and political change. In an information rich environment, with so many powerful influences we need to help our pupils to become discerning people. They need to be able to determine what is worth knowing, what is worth doing and which values are worth holding onto. These are the big questions. </p> <p>The good news is that the profession can make a difference, even as we deal with the current narrow measures of success. As a head you can determine a unique vision of your school. It is your answer to the big questions that ultimately defines the quality of the education you provide. Not the curriculum, nor assessment, but the values you hold.</p> <p>As a teacher you can make a difference. Everything we accept becomes acceptable. Everything we value becomes valuable. Everything we do with enthusiasm becomes inspiring. Everything we do grudgingly becomes a chore. When we are sensitive, we sensitise. When we are dismissive, we negate. Our lowest expectations are self-fulfilling. Our highest expectations become possible. As Ruskin said 'There is a striking quality to fine classrooms. Pupils are caught up in learning, excitement abounds and playfulness and seriousness blend easily because the purposes are clear, the goals sensible and an unmistakable feeling of well being prevails'.</p> <p>For me there is no greater mission than education. It is in our gift to create a success culture through a belief in the inherent skills and abilities of our pupils and our staff. If we truly value education then we must offer an alternative and positive vision of teaching. This is what the Teaching Awards Trust is all about. Our mission is to celebrate excellence and promote best practice. We consider teachers to be the greatest resource and asset in our schools and we are taking active steps to invest in them and so our future.</p>",

  "The shadow home secretary, David Davis, today dramatically pulled out of a launch event for a new book by immigration service whistleblower Steve Moxon, which is highly critical of Britain's ethnic minority communities. <p>Mr Davis was due to attend a lunchtime event to publicise the book entitled The Great Immigration Scandal, although Conservative Central Office had already denied that he would be \"chairing\" the event, as the invitations had stated.</p> <p>But with less than three hours to go, the shadow home secretary - who had championed Mr Moxon as a wronged whistleblower for his role in revealing lax visa checks for EU accession country applicants - withdrew from the event.</p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Davis said he \"respected Mr Moxon as a whistleblower\" but had not read the controversial book when he accepted the invitation.</p> <p>In the book, Mr Moxon goes some way to defending the British National party (BNP), attacks equal opportunity schemes for immigrants, ridicules the idea that immigrants make a net economic contribution and casually remarks that people should take \"extra caution\" in \"predominantly Afro-Caribbean areas or where blacks deal drugs or pimp girls\".</p> <p>Mr Davis publicly backed Mr Moxon when he was first suspended, then dismissed, from his job, and publishers Imprint Academic had claimed that Mr Davis would be chairing today's launch at the British Academy in London.</p> <p>The embarrassing U-turn will fuel Labour accusations that the Tory party has reverted to the \"attack dog\" mode of former leader William Hague, championing tabloid causes and chasing headlines without a detailed strategy of its own.</p> <p>At his book launch, Mr Moxon strenuously denied allegations of racism. \"Anyone who looks into my background will not find anything that can be misconstrued as racist,\" he told a press conference. </p> <p>He said Britain was suffering from a \"disease of political correctness\". He also compared Tony Blair with the former Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. </p> <p>\"There is not much actually that distinguishes Mussolini from Blair,\" he said. \"They have a shared idea of a third way which is much more rightwing in Blair's conceptions of it.\" </p> <p>The book's publisher, Keith Sutherland, said of Mr Davis' failure to attend: \"Unfortunately he appears to have been frightened off by the Independent article that was published this morning. His office have actually had a copy of the book for the best part of a month. </p> <p> \"The pretext that his office has given for pulling out of this is the rather strange claim that the book is in some way condoning another political party. Neither Steve nor the publisher have had any contact nor any interest in the activities of the BNP.\" </p> <p>Last night Simon Wolley, the director of Operation Black Vote, warned that the book was nothing more than a \"poisonous Islamophobic rant\" and that it would be \"political suicide\" for any party to associate itself with it.</p> <p>e said: \"A more racist, hate-filled book would be hard to find. Moxon's poisonous rant is designed to sow fear, terror and distrust between the white and ethnic communities.\"</p> <p>In the book, which deals at length with his sacking from his Sheffield job within the immigration and nationality directorate - and with it the resignation of the then immigration minister Beverley Hughes after she denied knowing about the affair on television - Mr Moxon describes \"nigger\" as an ironic term and also claims \"Paki\" is not necessarily derogatory. </p> <p>The 48-year-old claims an \"explosion\" of immigration could lead to civil war, and the mass of \"ordinary people\" driven to vote for the openly racist BNP.</p> <p>In a separate move today, Tory officials distanced themselves from proposals to bar low-earning migrants from settling in Britain. </p> <p>A report commissioned by the party suggests only highly-educated workers who earn at least \u00a325,000 a year would be allowed to live in Britain. But Conservative Central Office insisted this would never become party policy. </p> <p>The proposal comes in a report commissioned by the party. It was drawn up by an inquiry headed by former Tory immigration minister Timothy Kirkhope - now a Conservative MEP. </p> <p>The proposal would mean migrants would have to prove they have a good university degree and would be ineligible for state benefits so they do not become a burden on the taxpayer. </p> <p>The report said Britain was one of the most densely populated countries in the world and could not cope with extra people. However, a spokeswoman from Conservative Central Office said: \"This is just one of a number of suggestions made by the inquiry. But it is not Conservative party policy and it is not something we will be moving forward with.\"</p>",
  "<p>As childhoods go, Gil Rossellini's sounds idyllic. As he sits in the courtyard of a villa in Venice, the dapper Italo-Indian producer reminisces about long, lazy family holidays spent with his extended family. He was very close to his father. Both shared a passion for racing cars and machinery. At home, they built a special lab where they fooled around with lenses, movie cameras and Moviolas. \"There was this 60-year-old man and this 10-year-old boy, always tinkering together,\" he says, evoking an image of a sorcerer and his apprentice. </p> <p>In theory, Rossellini is giving me an interview to promote The Princess of Mount Ledang, the first Malaysian film ever to screen at an international film festival. He co-produced this 15th-century romantic epic, which is set at the time of the Melaka sultanate. Later in the day, he is due to meet Malaysia's crown prince and its minister of tourism, who are coming to the Lido to support the premiere. Rossellini proselytises on behalf of the movie, trumpeting its importance to Malaysian culture and to the local film industry in particular. Somehow, though, our conversation keeps twisting back to his family. </p> <p>Gil was the adopted son of Roberto Rossellini, one of the most influential directors in cinema history. His mother, Indian writer Sonali Das Gupta, married Rossellini when they eloped in the late 1950s, after the Italian director's relationship with Ingrid Bergman had broken down. </p> <p>One might think Rossellini's rift with Bergman would have split the family, but Gil insists this was never the case. \"Ours was a very patriarchal and tribal family. We all grew up together. The previous wives were friends with one another. When my mother arrived from India, she had a call from the first wife, who warned her, 'Be careful with that man.'\" </p> <p>In the summer, the entire Rossellini clan would decamp to a house by the sea - seven kids from three different marriages, various nannies and several of the kids' friends. Two of the wives would stay the whole time. There would be fleeting visits from Ingrid Bergman, film and theatre commitments permitting. Rossellini himself would turn up at weekends in his grand Ferrari. </p> <p>Gil was aware that his father was a film-maker, but didn't know much about his work. When he was 12, he worked as a runner on one of his father's films, Acts of the Apostles. \"It was heaven on earth because it was shot in Tunisia in the middle of the school year,\" he says. \"But when I was older, 16 or 17, I considered having to be on the set with my father as child abuse. It wasn't really fun.\" </p> <p>At home, though there was a constant stream of visitors from the movie world (Charlie Chaplin and Vittorio de Sica among them), no one talked much about cinema. When Gil started going to films himself, he'd see \"things like M*A*S*H or Easy Rider - films of my generation\". It was only two years after his father's death, when Gil and his sister Isabella were invited to a retrospective of his father's films in Charleston, South Carolina in 1979, that he realised that there was more to the old man's work than he had imagined. \"I saw all his films in a space of two weeks. And I thought, 'Oh, shit! He was a really great film-maker.'\" </p> <p>Gil's favourite of his father's films is the neo-realist classic Germany Year Zero. \"That is not to do with the film itself - it has more to do with the man. Consider - my father was an Italian, part of the resistance movement. He had been prosecuted on so many fronts by the Nazis. He had been captured and had to escape - otherwise he would have been killed himself. One year after the end of the war, he goes to Berlin to make a film about the drama of the German people. To me, somebody who has the courage and clarity of mind to set aside all feelings of personal hatred - that is an example I have always wanted to follow.\" </p> <p>At college in the US, Gil studied physics and mathematics. \"That was his dream. I was good at maths at school and, like most fathers, he had a dream of me doing what he would have liked to do.\" Gil's obsession, though, was music. He wasn't especially successful in his chosen career. At one stage in the early 1980s, he found himself living penniless in New York. His then brother-in-law Martin Scorsese (married to his sister Isabella) offered him a job as a production assistant on The King of Comedy in 1983. The following year, he worked with Sergio Leone on Once Upon a Time in America, and his own career in the movies began in earnest. </p> <p>Gil now has his own production and distribution company, Rossellini and Associates. He has produced and directed many documentaries. (The latest, A Hole in the Wall, about slum children in India learning to use computers and the internet, will screen in London later this year.) Inevitably, his own achievements pale in comparison with those of his father. \"But it's not a shadow - my father casts a bright light of protection and of pride and joy.\" </p> <p>In a break from his duties promoting The Princess of Mount Ledang, Gil is planning to attend the launch of yet another biography of Roberto Rossellini. He doesn't have much faith that it will capture the personality of the man he remembers. </p> <p>\"Each of the biographies I have read has some elements which are real and some which are fantasy. It's not the fault of the writers. It's just that my father and most of his friends were the greatest liars on earth. They would make up stories about what they did 20 years, five years ago or even last night. They were great storytellers. That was why my father was a great film-maker. He could tell the story of lighting up a cigarette and turn it into the invention of fire.\"</p>",
  "South Africa's justice ministry today approved a request from Equatorial Guinea to question Sir Mark Thatcher over an alleged plot to overthrow its government. <p>The 51-year-old son of Lady Thatcher, the former British prime minister, is likely to face questioning in open court over allegations that he funded a coup attempt in the oil-rich state.</p> <p>Under South African law, the questions are given to a magistrate, who will then subpeona Sir Mark to answer. A spokesman for the justice ministry said it \"could all happen very fast now\".</p> <p>Sir Mark is also expected in court on November 25 over charges that he violated South Africa's anti-mercenary laws. He denies all charges.</p> <p>The alleged plotters were said to be hoping to exploit the country's vast oil reserves after overthrowing President Teodoro Obiang and installing their own leader, Severo Moto, who is currently in exile in Spain. </p> <p>Jose Olo Obono, Equatorial Guinea's chief prosecutor, told the Reuters news agency he may seek Sir Mark's extradition to stand trial alongside alleged foreign mercenaries including Nick du Toit, a South African arms dealer.</p> <p>Simon Mann, a former SAS officer and friend of Sir Mark's in the upmarket Cape Town suburb of Constantia, was last month convicted by a court in Zimbabwe on weapons charges. He had been held in Harare in connection with the alleged coup plot. </p> <p>President Obiang has accused foreign nations and firms of seeking to remove him as the leader of sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil producer, a position he has held since he seized power in 1979.</p> <p>In all, 88 men are in custody in South Africa, Equatorial Guinea and Zimbabwe in connection with the alleged plan, said to have been foiled in March. </p> <p>Sir Mark could face up to 15 years in jail in South Africa if he is convicted of helping to fund the purchase of a helicopter.</p> <p>Equatorial Guinea has said it will not seek the death penalty for Sir Mark in the event that he is extradited and convicted of bankrolling the alleged coup.</p>",
  "<p>An Iraqi resistance group claiming to be behind the kidnapping of two French journalists today issued a ransom demand, in a dramatic development that threatened to dash French hopes that the pair would soon be free.</p> <p>In a statement posted on its web site, the Islamic Army in Iraq said it was seeking a \u00a32.8m ransom for the release of Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot and set a 48-hour deadline for their demands to be met.</p> <p>The statement, which has not yet been authenticated, also called for a truce with the al-Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, and a promise of no military and commercial dealings with Iraq. </p> <p>These demands appear to be directed at the French government, which has been attempting to secure the release of Chesnot and Malbrunot for more than two weeks.</p> <p>The statement said the Islamic Army of Iraq had previously planned to release the journalists, but had been thwarted after they were attacked by coalition forces. </p> <p>A group claiming to be the Islamic Army of Iraq has previously sent videotaped messages featuring Chesnot and Malbrunot to the Arab news channel, al-Jazeera. </p> <p>The French Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the statement. </p> <p>Today's ransom demand and fresh deadline were the first word from the French journalists' kidnappers since a previous ultimatum expired last Wednesday. </p> <p>The Islamic Army of Iraq said it would accept just one of its demands being met, but issued a warning against any attempt to launch hostile action against the group.</p> <p>\"We warn you not to bombard us as you did ... on the day when we intended to deliver [the hostages] to you,\" the website statement said.</p> <p>The new ransom demand comes as negotiations to secure the release of two French journalists held hostage in Iraq were entering the \"delivery phase\", according to a French Muslim leader who had just returned from the Gulf state.</p> <p>However, a surge in violence in Iraq - where a car bomb has today killed seven US marines and three Iraqi national guardsmen - was proving an added obstacle to freeing Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, according to Fouad Alaoui, secretary general of the Union of French Islamic Organisations.</p> <p>\"I think we are in a phase I would call the delivery of the hostages, which is different to the phase of releasing the hostages,\" Mr Alaoui told radio station Europe 1.</p> <p>\"I am of the view that the hostages are no longer in the hands of their first kidnappers but rather in the hands of the Iraqi resistance,\" he added.</p> <p>But Mr Alaoui, who had returned to France after visiting Iraq with a delegation of French Muslim leaders to try to secure the release of Chesnot and Malbrunot, said he thought renewed hostilities between US forces and Iraqi insurgents was making the mission to free the pair \"difficult\".</p> <p>The French government sounded a more cautious note today about the chances of securing the release of Chesnot and Malbrunot, who were seized on August 20 while travelling from Baghdad to Najaf.</p> <p>The French defence minister, Michele Alliot-Marie, told LCI television: \"[Iraq] is in complete chaos, so that poses major difficulties. All we can say today is that we have reliable indications that allow us to think they are in good health and that [their] release is possible.\"</p> <p>The culture and communications minister, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, added that he still \"wanted to believe\" the release of Chesnot and Malbrunot would come \"as soon as possible\" in an interview with France-2 today.</p> <p>\"The situation is not simple. You understand that I am weighing my words very carefully because we do not want to do anything to compromise the outcome we are waiting for,\" Mr Donnedieu de Vabres said.</p> <p>French foreign minister Michel Barnier returned empty-handed from his trip to the Middle East in a diplomatic bid to secure the release of Chesnot and Malbrunot at the weekend.</p> <p>Today le Figaro reported that the French prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, had told ministers to be more cautious in their public comments for fear of damaging the delicate negotiations.</p> <p>Yesterday Mr Barnier emerged from a crisis meeting to discuss the hostages to say the government still had \"serious reasons to believe that they are both in good health and that a favourable outcome is possible\".</p> <p>But the Islamic Army in Iraq, which had claimed responsibility for the kidnappings, later issued a statement claiming it was still holding them. </p> <p>The abduction of Chesnier and Malbrunot has stunned France, a fierce opponent of the US-led invasion of Iraq, which has sparked a year of insurgency following the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime. </p> <p>Their kidnappers have demanded that Paris rescind new legislation that bars conspicuous religious symbols in state schools, including the wearing of headscarves by Muslim schoolgirls. </p> <p>In a videotape broadcast two weekends ago the hostages said they feared for their lives if the kidnappers' demands were not met, although there has been no direct threat of execution. </p> <p>The French government has refused to bow to the demands.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>As usual, the front page of today's Sun captured the national mood: 'Sven's World Cup Shambles'. Anyone not familiar with Saturday's events would have wondered what he'd done this time: presided over a 5-0 thrashing with Joe Cole and Jamie Carragher in central midfield? Headbutted the referee? Seduced the wife of the Austrian FA's president?</p> <p>In fact, all Eriksson had done was see his team sloppily throw away a two-goal lead in Austria. As heinous crimes go, it's up there with a quirky religious belief or some vaguely murky business dealings.</p> <p>And while many people feel Eriksson has taken this England side as far as he can, and is too innately conservative and clinical for them to fulfil their abundant potential, his haranguing in the press this morning has been absolutely risible.</p> <p>As usual, Gary Neville was the sole voice of reason amid the inanities of his team-mates and the agenda-driven nonsense of most of the tabloids.</p> <p>\"How can you even mention the manager?\" Neville thundered. \"Why are you asking about Sven-Goran Eriksson? Ask questions of the players. Blame it on us. We were the ones who threw away two points. But how can the manager be brought into the equation? </p> <p>\"On the basis of this match there is no way you can criticise the manager. Look at the bigger picture. For 70 minutes our performance was pretty damn good and we were in cruise control. Then we lost control. The manager didn't lose control - we did.\" </p> <p>He's right. The fact is that, for over an hour, England dominated an awkward away match as comprehensively as you could wish. And even the final result was nowhere near the worst of the night: imagine the brouhaha if England had drawn 1-1 at home to Ukraine, as Denmark did, or 1-1 at home to Lithuania, as Belgium did. Or 0-0 at home to Israel, which France did.</p> <p>The simple fact is that England could qualify from this group with their eyes closed, and that Eriksson is being butchered without rhyme or reason to fit in with an agenda that gathered a vicious momentum in the aftermath of Euro 2004.</p> <p>Even then, the knives came out for Eriksson only after Urs Meier had been harangued so disgracefully. The tabloids needed a new victim and, as with Glenn Hoddle post-France '98, they will not rest until they have their corpse. If England don't win in Poland on Wednesday, they will probably get it this week. It is a matter of when, not if.</p> <p>The areas for which Eriksson is being criticised are little more than convenient - for example, he has been ridiculed for saying there were many positives. But there were: two goals of striking brilliance, and a cool, composed performance that was only upset by one of those freak switches of momentum that, in the heat of an away fixture, become extremely difficult to control.</p> <p>He has been similarly ridiculed for publicly defending David James, and for saying that David Beckham, Wayne Bridge and Michael Owen did well. What is he supposed to do, criticise them? That has never been the domain of Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson, and it is that quality that inspires such fierce loyalty, and enables players to go the extra mile for their manager. </p> <p>Perhaps the press would be happier if he was constantly undermining his players. But wasn't that one of the main reasons they wanted England to get rid of Glenn Hoddle?</p> <p>One thing Eriksson has managed to do, throughout this increasingly sorry fiasco, is somehow keep his dignity. The same cannot be said of those trying to get rid of him.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:rob.smyth@theguardian.com\">rob.smyth@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Tyler Brule, BBC Four and a media programme: surely a combination as harmonious as a taupe leather seating unit alongside brown chevron coarse-weave curtains in a home designed by a cutting-edge architect with a penchant for retro.</p> <p>Followers of the founder of the once uber-trendy style magazine, Wallpaper, will recognise that fantasy design married with the avant-garde is Brule's calling card.</p> <p>So BBC4 is taking a gamble hiring the former publisher to present a media show which will presumably cover contemporary issues, such as today's reported sacking of the editor of the Russian newspaper, Izvestia, to the latest battle for Saturday night TV audiences. </p> <p>That said, Brule's internationalist, media-savvy and unashamedly modernist perspective will certainly be a breath of fresh air in the media world where navel-gazing is de rigeur.</p> <p>In his current guise as owner of the grand sounding Winkreative advertising and branding consultancy, his tentacles spread far and wide, taking in Marks and Spencer, Stella McCartney and the airline once known as Swiss Air, but now re-branded as Swiss.</p> <p>Certainly BBC Four's reputation for being high-brow will suit Brule's preoccupation with pretentiousness.</p> <p>\"It improved people's lives,\" was Brule's immodest assessment of Wallpaper, the magazine that in part defined the high living and modernist design zeitgeist of the late 1990s.</p> <p>Brule started Wallpaper on a shoestring in 1996, memorably defining its editorial ethos as being concerned with \"the stuff that surrounds you\" and including an asterisk in the masthead.</p> <p>When the buzz about Wallpaper was reaching its zenith, Brule sold the magazine to Time Warner in a $1m deal that left him 15% of the publication and editorial control - for a while, at least.</p> <p>The magazine made Brule's reputation but his time at Time Warner partly unmade it. The strangest of corporate bedfellows parted company, acrimoniously, in 2002 reportedly after disputes over expenses between Brule and Mike Soutar, who was in charge of IPC, Time Warner's UK offshoot.</p> <p>\"Much has been made of my last few months at the helm of Wallpaper,\" Brule wrote in the Guardian in 2002, \"but it's all rather petty if you stack it up against pieces from the Financial Times that define neighbourhoods as being 'very Wallpaper' or New York Times cover stories that talk about 'generation Wallpaper'.\"</p> <p>Brule has always fascinated the media, for hitting the big time in his 20s, for his style, his homosexuality, his jetsetting lifestyle and for being obsessed with design after a previous incarnation as a war correspondent - he reportedly took two bullets while on assignment in Afghanistan in 1994.</p> <p>But in turn Brule he has long been fascinated by the media. In the distant past, circa 1991, he was filing media stories for The Guardian, along the lines of: \"Out of a classy closet - an unlikely new US publication has just been launched in the depths of a recession. It's a glossy gay style magazine\".</p> <p>In more recent years, Winkreative, founded when Brule was at Time Warner, has enjoyed mixed success. </p> <p>Winkreative put the glamour back into flying when it rebranded Swiss Air in 2002, after the airline painfully went belly up in October 2001 and had to be rescued by two Swiss banks. Brule rebranded it Swiss International Airlines, or more often just Swiss, in keeping with its heritage but moving it to the top end of the market.</p> <p>Not so successful was Winkreative's hand in the branding of Marks &amp; Spencer's flashy Lifestore home furnishings store. </p> <p>It launched earlier this year in Gateshead, but died a very quick death when exposed as a retailing disaster. Shortly afterward M&amp;S's new management decided it was time to go back to basics and M&amp;S's relationship with Winkreative's is unclear. </p> <p>Its clients includes RJ Reynolds, the tobacco company, BMW and a rack of fashion labels, including Marlboro Classics, Bally shoes and Stella McCartney.</p> <p>The branding company was behind the upmarket olive logo for Sky One that recently made its debut. Critics were less than kind, saying the channel's logo would look good when it was finished.</p> <p>Of his new TV venture for the BBC, Brule says in a statement: \"The Desk will fill a huge gap in the schedules by satisfying people's unquenchable thirst for news about the media in all its forms.\" </p> <p>\"It's exciting to be able to bring both the UK and international media agenda to television.\" But uncharacteristically, Brule will not be in charge of the programme. The role of executive producer has gone to Moonbeam's Anne Reevell, a former deputy home news editor on BBC TV news in the 1980s, when Brule was presumably still at school.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "Last Friday the Lebanese parliament decided, by 96 votes to 29, to give President Emile Lahoud three more years in office. <p>By all accounts this was a deeply unpopular move in Lebanon, though extending a president's term is something the parliament is legally entitled to do. The anger stems from the undoubted fact that the parliament would never have made such a decision had it not been pressurised by Lebanon's more powerful neighbour, Syria. </p> <p>The extension of President Lahoud's term also flies in the face of a sound principle that the Lebanese constitution originally sought to establish: that presidents should serve one term of six years and then leave office. Without Syria's intervention, Lahoud would have had to move out of his splendid hilltop palace in November. </p> <p>Exactly why this has happened is still a bit of a mystery. The Beirut newspaper, the Daily Star, commented a few days ago: \"A very strange aspect of this move is that it seems to have little, if anything, to do with the person or politics of the president. Emile Lahoud in his own right has been a legitimate president who has served his country honourably, and his policies are clearly acceptable to the majority of Lebanese. </p> <p>\"In the same manner, the Syrian government or the Lebanese people and parliament would have had no difficulty at all choosing a new president whose policies and manner would have been very similar to those of the current incumbent. </p> <p>\"The issue clearly is not about either irresistible personal traits or compelling political positions that are only available in President Lahoud.\" </p> <p>It is not the first time this has happened. In 1995, as President Elias Hrawi's term in office came to an end, parliament also voted to give him three more years, also as a result of Syrian pressure. </p> <p>Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon and President Lahoud is regarded as its main ally there. </p> <p>The president, though, is rather less powerful in terms of day-to-day running of the country than other Arab presidents. This is because of the system of checks and balances established after the civil war, which combines a Christian president with a Sunni Muslim prime minister and a Shia speaker for the parliament. </p> <p>Prime minister Rafik Hariri is one of the smartest Arab politicians and, while avoiding direct confrontation with the Syrians, he has built alliances inside and outside Lebanon that sometimes allow him to get his way. He is also probably the richest man in Lebanon (and has grown even richer while in office), which makes him a force to be reckoned with in his own right. </p> <p>Unusually, less than 24 hours before the parliamentary vote in Beirut, the UN security council met and passed Resolution 1559 which, in effect, called on Syria to respect Lebanon's sovereignty. Predictably, the Lebanese foreign ministry denounced this as \"interference\" in Lebanon's internal affairs and in the \"bilateral relations between two friendly countries, none of which has filed any complaint\". </p> <p>Several security council members were dubious about the resolution, and, in the event, it was approved with a mere nine votes in favour (China, Russia, Pakistan, Algeria, Brazil and the Philippines abstained) - and then only after the draft had been watered down to remove direct mention of Syria and threats of \"additional measures\" if Syria failed to comply. </p> <p>On the Richter scale of constitutional jiggery-pokery, the extension of President Lahoud's term ranks as a minor tremor. It may have been undesirable and unnecessary but far worse cases of constitutional abuse have occurred elsewhere in the world with scarcely a murmur from the security council. </p> <p>It will come as no surprise that one of the two sponsors of Resolution 1559 was the United States which earlier this year imposed economic sanctions on Syria (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,1218751,00.html\">Suspicious sanctions</a>, May 17 2004). </p> <p>Anti-Syrian sentiment has been stirred up in the US by an alliance of Israel supporters, American neo-conservatives and the wilder Lebanese Christian elements, and enshrined in the bizarre Syria Accountability Act which was originally put to Congress by Senator Rick Santorum, a full-blooded \"three Gs\" Republican (pro-God, pro-guns, anti-gay). </p> <p>Interestingly, though, the security council resolution's other sponsor was France, which has not seen eye-to-eye with the US on many things lately. What was the French interest on this occasion? </p> <p>One theory is that France was encouraged to get involved by Prime Minister Hariri in a sort of arm's length way of making his feelings known to Syria. Hariri and the French president, Jacques Chirac, are on especially friendly terms. A couple of years ago claims surfaced in the French press - subsequently denied - that Hariri had helped Chirac with his electoral campaign funding. </p> <p>Besides meddling in Lebanese politics, Syria still has an estimated 17,000 troops in the country, though they are less obtrusive than they were and are there - officially at least - with the agreement of the Lebanese government. </p> <p>Syrian involvement has also had its positive aspects: it helped to bring stability after the 15-year civil war. But the civil war ended 14 years ago and many Lebanese think it is now time to stand on their own feet. </p> <p>From Syria's perspective, though, its involvement in Lebanon serves a strategic purpose. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Syria has no significant international allies. At the same time, the Israelis continue to occupy part of its territory (the Golan Heights) and last week they blamed Syria for the double suicide bombing in Beersheba. </p> <p>There are also increasingly strident verbal threats from Washington and a situation in neighbouring Iraq which is precarious at best. </p> <p>Taking into account these feelings of isolation and insecurity, it becomes easier to see why Syria attaches so much importance to internal stability and predictability in Lebanon on its western flank. </p> <p>In Damascus, Lebanon's compulsory friendship with Syria, plus Syria's relationship with the Lebanese Hizbullah, are viewed as a deterrent to Israeli ambitions in the region and ultimately as a lever for securing the return of the Golan Heights. </p> <p>As with much else in Damascus, this represents an old-style view of international politics, though there are some who argue that in the post-9/11 world, Syria would do better by copying Libya's recent example and polishing up its relations with as many people as possible. </p> <p>Instead, the extension of Lahoud's presidential term has driven Europe and the US closer together at a time when Syria was hoping for European support to counter American threats and economic sanctions. One adverse result is that finalisation of Syria's important Association Agreement with Europe, which would bring economic and other benefits, looks like being further delayed. </p> <p>\"I have no doubt they [the Syrians] are making a political blunder because they are setting a lot of Lebanese against them as well the French, the Americans and others,\" Patrick Seale, a British expert on Syria, told Reuters news agency last week. </p> <p>\"But they ... feel the need to protect themselves and Lebanon is where they feel vulnerable,\" he continued. </p> <p>Seale suggested that Lahoud, as a former army chief with continuing links to the security services, is the most reassuring person for the Lebanese presidency from Syria's viewpoint. </p> <p>\"No other presidential candidates would offer them so much control when they are facing a very dangerous and aggressive situation with Israel. They are sacrificing political popularity for security policy,\" he said. </p> <p>Possibly Damascus has calculated that it can ride out the criticisms, especially with attention in Washington diverted by the presidential election campaign. But if President Bush is returned to office, the Syrians may find that they have gratuitously handed him one more cudgel to beat them with.</p>",

  "<p>For too many students, getting into debt is as much a part of university as cramming for exams and drinking pound a pint lager. The rising cost of studying coupled with many parents' inability to foot the entire bill up front mean that a lot of freshers will already have racked up some debt by the end of their first year at university. But while debt may be inevitable for many, keeping the cost of borrowing down is both essential and manageable.</p> <p>Annabel Brodie-Smith, director of the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) says: \"Many young people go to university to enjoy some of the best years of their life but at the end of three years find themselves deeply in debt.\" The AITC's research has shown that students and parents alike fail to appreciate the full cost of higher education. \"Students expect their parents to fund them, when in actual fact, less than a third of parents say they are in a position to do so,\" says Ms Brodie-Smith.</p> <p>It's important to be clear about your finances from the start. \"Work out a budget,\" says Gill Cardy, an independent financial adviser. \"For many, this is the first experience of living alone, being totally responsible for food costs, utility bills and so on. You may not have a realistic idea of the figures involved.\"</p> <p>The National Union of Students (NUS) estimates the average course costs for the 39-week academic year 2004/5 at \u00a32,100 for students inside London, and \u00a31,734 for those living elsewhere. This figure includes tuition fees (\u00a31,150) money for books and equipment (\u00a3132: \u00a3315 for London) and travel (\u00a3438: \u00a3621 for London). Added to that are actual living costs, estimated at \u00a38,086 for Londoners and \u00a36,850 for the rest of the country. The largest outgoing in this section is rent, estimated at \u00a32,146 (\u00a32,989 for London). Food comes in third at \u00a31,103 (\u00a31,247 for London). Beating it into second place is the \"leisure\" category, allocated \u00a31,440 across the board. So all those happy people heading off to university will have to find around \u00a310,186 for their first year if they are heading to a London university, \u00a38,584 if they're off to study in another part of the country. </p> <p>Bearing in mind that parental contribution cannot always be counted on, and given that a student's earning power is usually quite limited, the next port of call is generally a student loan. Gavin Greig, from the Student Loans Company, says \"A student loan is in effect interest-free, because the interest is based on the Retail Price Index (RPI). So this year it's 2.6%, while last year it was 3.1%. Compared with the rates at a high street bank or on a visa card, which might be 18.9%, that's really very good\". </p> <p>But while Ms Cardy agrees that student loans are a good option, she cautions against getting carried away. It can be difficult to get to grips with the fact that you will have to live on that money for a whole term. \"Try simple techniques to control your spending - maybe take out your week's money in one go and then don't let yourself take out any more,\" she says, although having that wad of cash around on the first day creates a temptation to overspend that will require discipline to avoid. </p> <p>Joanna O'Brien, from the financial website Moneyfacts, says: \"It might be worth putting that lump sum into a savings account rather than your current account. For example, Intelligent Finance offers an instant access account at a reasonable rate.\"</p> <p>However, the NUS calculates that, after student loans, the average student still faces a cost of living shortfall of about \u00a35,513 (\u00a36,399). </p> <p>There are a number of options available to make up the difference, but it's important to choose carefully to get the best deal. It's also important not to get carried away. We all know how easy it is to develop an \"in for a penny, in for a pound\" attitude to getting into debt, but one day you will have to pay it all back - with interest. </p> <p>Interest-free overdrafts on student current accounts can offer something of a fallback, but make sure you pick the right one. \"It's staggering how many people choose an account because their parents have it,\" says Gill Cardy, \"Many accounts offer interest-free overdrafts which can be a useful and cheap way to borrow money. </p> <p>If you do plan to use your interest-free overdraft, Joanna O'Brien says: \"Ask exactly how much is interest-free and whatever you do, don't go into unauthorised overdraft.\" If you go over your limit, you could be faced with big charges. Keep an eye on the amount you can borrow interest-free as you may find that interest kicks in at a much lower level than you think.</p> <p>Remember too, that as a student you shouldn't pay tax on interest paid on your balance when you're in the black. Gill Cardy explains: \"The default position is that interest on a bank or building society account is calculated with the 20% income tax already deducted. As non-taxpayers this shouldn't happen to most students, so make sure you have filled in the Inland Revenue's R85 form to claim exemption.\" </p> <p>It's common sense that running up credit card bills is not a good idea when your income is limited, but if you must have a credit card, the first thing to do is to look at the APR. \"Some places offer student credit cards, \" says Joanna O'Brien, \"which can be useful if you can't get a card from anywhere else. But if you can, bear in mind that student cards generally don't offer the best rates of interest.\" </p> <p>Moneyfacts.co.uk can give you a good idea of the lowest APR rates available, or the best balance transfer offers if you're switching from another card. In that instance, \"cut up your original card\" implores Gill Hardy. Although, these finer points are missed if you then start running up bills on both cards.</p> <p>As for store cards, steer clear. \"I certainly wouldn't recommend store cards in any form,\" says Joanna O'Brien, \"they are so expensive. You could be looking at an APR of 31%.\"</p> <p>The debt students face already is substantial: according to the NUS, since most students take out a student loan (which could be over \u00a314,814 in London) and are almost certain to supplement that with other borrowing, those starting a course in 2004 could face a debt of \u00a316,294 on graduation. When increased tuition fees are introduced in 2006, friendly society the Children's Mutual suggests it will add \u00a35,550 to that final debt.</p> <p>While the Association of Graduate Recruiters found the average graduate starting salary this year is \u00a321,100, Gill Cardy warns against assuming that you will have plenty of money to pay back your loans once you graduate: \"Your lifestyle adjusts and so do your needs. You may need expensive clothes for work. Your rent is likely to be higher.\" </p> <p>But by borrowing sensibly you can minimise the pain. And if you do get in trouble, don't be tempted to ignore it. Dodging your rent, failing to make repayments or pay utility bills and so on could mean you run the risk of getting a county court judgement, which could make things difficult for you later. If you're in more debt than you can handle, seek advice. \"Most student unions have counselling services,\" says Gill Cardy. \"You don't have to suffer in silence.\"</p>",
  "<p>Labour today dismissed Tory plans to give schools an extra \u00a35.7bn a year by slashing the number of civil servants, labelling their sums \"dodgy\" and accusing them of planning \"deep cuts\" to public services.</p> <p>The Conservative party's plans involve slashing 2,700 civil service posts and further cuts to the schools' inspectorate, Ofsted. The Tory plans mirror those already underway within the government following a review of the size of civil service by Sir Peter Gershon, albeit on a larger scale. </p> <p>Today the Conservatives claimed that they would free schools from excessive interference from central and local government and plough the savings into providing more teachers.</p> <p>The proposals, drawn up by former Millennium Dome chief, David James, would also see seven funds or quangos brought to an end, the Ofsted schools inspectorate streamlined and the role of local education authorities curtailed, with schools given extra freedom to run their own affairs. </p> <p>The shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin said the Department for Education typified the \"fat and bloated bureaucracy\" created by Labour. </p> <p>\"These proposals will remove vast swathes of unnecessary government control over education spending and put large sums of extra cash in the front line where it belongs,\" he said. </p> <p>Chief secretary to the Treasury Paul Boateng told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme today that the Tories' plans for savings across government displayed a common thread, which was, he said, \"dodgy figures, smoke and mirrors\". </p> <p>Mr Boateng continued: \"What they seek to disguise, although they don't, is deep cuts in vital public services. </p> <p>\"The figures and the numbers simply don't add up. And whether you apply it, as they have over the summer, to Defra (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), the civil service generally, and now the Department for Education and Skills, what you have is cuts, privatisation, the old Tory agenda.\" </p> <p>Mr Boateng went on: \"What we have done with the Gershon review is actually to put in place evidence-based analysis, led by Sir Peter Gershon, of the requirements of the public service. </p> <p>\"He has already identified, and Charles Clarke and the DfES (Department for Department for Education and Skills) have committed to, efficiency savings of 2.5% annually, leading to \u00a34.3bn to be saved within that department by 2007/8.\" </p> <p>The government announced in the spring budget statement that it is planning to shed 1,460 jobs at the Department for Education and Skills and a further 500 at Ofsted. </p> <p>The move was welcomed by teachers as it emerged that the cuts would largely come from the department's standards unit, which had been accused of adding to headteachers' workload by excessively monitoring progress in schools.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Tories conceded that the plans were similar to the government, but claimed they would be more effective. \"It's \u00a32bn more than Gershon's managed to find. We can do it better with more teachers,\" she said. </p> <p>Under the Tory plans, schools would also have more autonomy from local authorities, bringing further savings that the Liberal Democrats said would impact on the most needy children. Phil Willis MP, Liberal Democrat spokesperson for education, said: \"Local authorities are looking after children with special needs and are responsible for school transport. The Tories seem to see nothing wrong with cuttings in these two vital sectors. </p> <p>\"These proposals are recycled versions of William Hague's failed policies. They are bad news for pupils with special educational needs and bad news for families who rely on school transport.\"</p> <p>The Labour government has its own plans to allow schools to \"earn\" their autonomy from local authorities by proving that they can run as \"independent specialist\" schools.</p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said: \"We strongly support the principal of getting more of the education budget directly to schools, and for schools to have more autonomy, but this must be within a framework of collaboration. </p> <p>\"I think that we are already moving towards a different relationship between local authorities and schools in which more power is delegated to the schools themselves. I think that's the right way forward. But the DfES cannot run a system with 25,000 schools without some intermediate peer.\"</p>",
  "<p>I first saw him, many years ago now, staring out with an uncanny gaze of blank intensity from the pages of a newspaper. Seated alone on a bench, immune to the endless motion of the airport around him, there was a curious inscrutability to his slight, balding yet dignified countenance. He looked like some unlikely cross between a Zen master and Chaplin's Tramp. He had these amazing long brows, as dark as his hooded eyes, and a small, perfectly groomed moustache perched on top of his upper lip. It was like a caricature of a face, five charcoal marks on a canvas. But strangely noble, too. </p> <p>His name was Merhan Karimi Nasseri though he called himself \"Sir Alfred\". He lived in a lost dimension of absurd bureaucratic entanglement. That is to say, on a bench in Terminal One of the Charles de Gaulle International Airport, and he had lived there since 1988. For a series of insanely complicated reasons, the Iranian-born refugee was now a man without a country - or any other documented, internationally accepted identity status. Alfred couldn't leave France because he did not have papers; he couldn't enter France because he did not have papers. The authorities told him to wait in the airport lounge while they sorted the paradox out. That he did - for years and years. </p> <p>Then one day, I heard that Alfred had finally been given his papers. He was free to go anywhere in the world he wished. Except now it seemed he didn't want to leave the airport after all. It was the only home - the only past - he had left. </p> <p>I woke up that night burning with an idea for a movie about Alfred - co-starring Alfred himself. I counted the hours before I could hit my desk and get started on the script. To me, his unlikely nightmare was nothing less than one of the quintessential tales of our lonely, displaced, increasingly unreal age. </p> <p>Perhaps I was a little overexcited, but I soon found that I was not the only one inspired by Alfred's true story. Every screenwriter in London seemed to have a version of his life in the drawer somewhere. And every single one (except mine) was a romantic comedy with a happy ending. None of the others had been made, nor would they ever be. Because word was out that over at DreamWorks, Steven - the Steven - was interested in the story. In sunny faraway LA, the big boys were preparing to immortalise Sir Alfred. </p> <p>Meanwhile, down at the other end of the world cinematic digestive system, my friend Glen Luchford and I grabbed a DV camera and a few changes of clothes and drove overnight to meet Alfred in the airport. Fittingly, days turned into months and we ended up spending close to a year with him shooting our low budget, arthouse feature, Here to Where (2001). If you've seen it, I probably know you. </p> <p>Recently, Alfred has been back in the news again. Spielberg's latest, The Terminal, starring Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, is playing on thousands of screens around the world. Media everywhere is asking the same old question. Who is Alfred? No one has a clue. Alfred least of all, it seems. That is exactly how he wants it - I have spent enough time with him to know that. He has been in the airport for 16 years now. I suppose my fantasy upon first meeting Alfred back in the summer of 2000 was that I would be the one to save him. Where friendly lawyers, concerned doctors, crusading refugee groups and assorted praying Christians had failed, I would succeed. I would be the one to convince him to finally leave the airport. </p> <p>He lived in the basement shopping mall of Terminal One. The circular main building was a triumph of avant-garde airport design when it opened in 1974, but its swank jet-age days were long gone. Alfred's red bench was the only anchor in his life. It was his bed, living room and corporate headquarters. It was actually two benches pushed together, about eight feet long in total and gently curved, just about wide enough to sleep on if he kept his hands tucked under the pillow. (Alfred did have a pillow - and sheets - that he carefully laid down when he turned in for the night.) But he never slept during the day, though his eyes would often droop out of boredom; you could always find Alfred sitting in the middle of his bench, in front of a rickety, white Formica table, which he employed as a desk. </p> <p>From this perch, Alfred would survey his world. The display windows of an electronics store were across a corridor to his left; he could see the back of a newsagent's to the right. If he moved to one side of his bench, he could gaze across to a MacDonald's on the outer ring of the level. If he moved to the other, there were the shuttered doors of the misleadingly named Hotel Cocoon. </p> <p>Stacked around the back of the bench were boxes, suitcases and plastic bags containing everything Alfred owned in the world. This included: an extensive archive of newspaper, magazine and TV reports about himself; a rather large library donated by friendly passengers with lousy taste; giant files of postcards and letters from well-wishers around the world; his dry cleaning; a vast collection of McDonald's straws and - most tantalisingly - a diary which recorded in apparently exacting detail every day of his bizarre existence since he first appeared at Terminal One. </p> <p>Sitting next to Alfred I tried to get into the rhythm of his airport life. It was punctuated every other minute by three chimes heralding the flight announcements, that exotic mantra of foreign destinations that practically drove me mad by the end of my first day there. But Alfred had evolved in his strange habitat; he was able to tune them out. Life in the airport followed a masterplan, designed and controlled by some far off power. Waves of passengers came and went, the same patterns of humanity every hour, every day - the tide would bring in the Japanese in the early morning, the Africans would wash past the bench late at night. </p> <p>Many passers-by recognised Alfred; some had even made a special pilgrimage to meet him, first or last stop on their Paris tour. Even those who had never heard of him seemed to sense that this was no ordinary passenger. He provoked pity in all of them but Alfred certainly didn't see it that way. He had an extremely high opinion of himself. And besides, as he would quickly remind you, his situation was only \"temporary\". </p> <p>During Alfred's first years in the airport, his basic needs were supplied by sympathetic passers-by and airport workers who knew of his Kafkaesque situation. People bought him food, gave him money and listened with sympathy to his tale. But by the time I met him, Alfred had developed a more retail approach to survival. Now he preferred to engage with the professionals of the media, people like me. In return for a few exclusive hours of his stream of consciousness tale, Alfred would graciously accept a small gratuity. The constant stream of journalists and film-makers passing through provided more than enough to keep him going. </p> <p>And yet from the moment I sat down next to him I felt the force of his - there is no better word - dignity. Alfred seemed totally content within himself. He did not aim to please or play on your sympathy. He was not the homeless guy on the tube singing for a drink. Everything in Alfred's life was conducted on his own terms. In some sense he was a freer man than most. </p> <p>Despite outward appearances, Alfred lived a life of total self-sufficiency and order. He kept himself meticulously clean and groomed, using a nearby airport bathroom. He hung his freshly dry-cleaned clothes from the handle of a suitcase next to his bench. He always ate a MacDonald's egg and bacon croissant for breakfast and a McDonald's fish sandwich for dinner. (Perhaps one day McDonald's will have the wit to sign Alfred up for a celebrity endorsement.) He always left a tip. Alfred was not, to put it bluntly, a bum. </p> <p>Still, I felt sorry for him - how could I not? Because one thing was never made quite clear in all the reports about Alfred: just how far gone he was. When he got talking about politics or the economy you could sense the remnants of a fine mind. But when he turned to his past you were dragged into the labyrinth of Alfred's fragile mental state. All the stories he had ever told over the years, all the articles ever written about him, were jumbled together in his head to produce a narrative that changed from day to day. The more you pressed him, the more absurd his supposed memories would become until he would suddenly stop short and fall silent. There seemed to be something in his past that he needed to forget. </p> <p>It was very frustrating. He once spent a week insisting to me that he was really Swedish. But his most consistent story, as far as I could piece it together, went like this: </p> <p>After his physician father's death in 1972, his family summoned him with the news that he was illegitimate. His real mother was, in fact, Scottish. (Looking at him, this seemed unlikely.) His family rejected him and Alfred left home to study Yugoslav economics in northern England. (This, amazingly, turned out to be true.) He returned to Iran in 1974 and got caught up in anti-Shah demonstrations. Arrested and tortured by Savak, the Iranian ministry of security, Alfred was stripped of his Iranian nationality and expelled. He spent the next years roaming through Europe in a search for asylum. Finally, in 1981, Belgium granted him refugee status and identity documents. That should have been a happy ending, of sorts. </p> <p>Instead, soon afterwards Alfred was robbed of his documents or - according to another version - sent them back to the authorities in what he called \"a moment of folly\". He left Belgium for France where he spent the next years in and out of jail on illegal immigration charges. Apparently, he tried to return to England but was turned back at Heathrow. It was at this point, in 1988, that he first settled into his limbo waiting for papers in Terminal One. A prominent lawyer took on Alfred's case and fought a 10-year legal battle to win him identity documents and the right to travel. But then Alfred refused to leave the airport. </p> <p>If nothing changed, he would die on his red bench. </p> <p>It seems very naive to me now, but I hoped that the making of Here to Where would somehow provide the catalyst for Alfred to reclaim a \"normal\" existence. It was the story of Paul Hugo, a selfish and incompetent American director (played by me, naturally) who goes to Paris to make a fiction film about Alfred's life. Along the way, Hugo's own life falls apart; his producer and crew turn on him, his main actor quits, his girlfriend leaves him and shooting grinds to a halt. The arrogant young man changes from using Alfred to identifying with him. Hugo redirects all his frantic energies to saving him - or what he thinks will save him. My plan was that the last scene would see Alfred and I leave the airport together both on film and in real life. </p> <p>It didn't exactly work out like that. For one thing, Alfred wasn't going anywhere, despite all my best efforts. Otherwise, our script took over reality or perhaps it was vice versa - I wasn't sure after a while. My friend Glen and I were at each other's throats, the crew was in revolt, my girlfriend left me, the money ran out. Only Alfred kept his cool, looking on with his usual Zen-like detachment. </p> <p>The last day of filming was an emotional one for me. My character Paul Hugo had spent the night in the airport sleeping on the floor next to Alfred. Early the next morning they were in the airport bathroom, looking into the mirror at themselves, shaving. Nothing had worked out as I hoped. I felt we had failed Alfred in every way. </p> <p>\"I'm worried about what's going to happen to you,\" my character said. He was still trying to get Alfred to leave the airport, though I had long given up. </p> <p>\"I followed my identification,\" Alfred replied. \"But you've been doing that a long time, right?\" \"Yes, it takes longer,\" he said. \"I know, but nothing has changed.\" \"Many things have changed.\" \"But you're still here, Alfred, right? You're still at the airport.\" \"Yes,\" he replied, carefully grooming his moustache. \"One of the airport's passengers. I'm always a passenger. If I go, I come back again. I'm not wandering. I don't wander.\" </p> <p>Suddenly, Alfred turned his back on me and walked out of the bathroom. I broke down in tears - me, not Paul Hugo. Like everyone else, we had used him and were about to walk away. What did he truly understand about our intentions - about the cynical real world beyond his bench? </p> <p>Alfred walked up to Glen in the corridor outside the bathroom. </p> <p>\"How did I do?\" he asked. </p> <p>Last week I flew to meet Alfred, three years since I last saw him. His noble Persian face lit up when he recognised me, but then it always does when he first sees a reporter. We shook hands. He seemed quite content. </p> <p>\"I am famous now,\" was the first thing he said to me. </p> <p>That was the only thing that mattered to him any more. Not his family or friends, not his past or future - only the archive of articles about a wasted life and a poster advertising Spielberg's film which he proudly hung from a suitcase next to his bench. \"Life is waiting,\" went the Hollywood ad slogan. </p> <p>Alfred was thrilled about The Terminal, though he would never get a chance to see it. He was looking forward to the Oscars. I didn't want to shatter his daydreams by telling him what a load of puerile crap Spielberg's movie was. I doubt he would have believed me anyway. \"Yes, my interest in America has gone up because of movie,\" Alfred said. \"That is very good.\" </p> <p>Apparently Alfred had received a cheque of several hundred thousand dollars for his life story. It had been deposited in the airport's Post Office bank. But Alfred had never cared much about money. He was now under the impression that DreamWorks was going to get him a passport and take him to California. Spielberg was going to come to his rescue; Tom Hanks was going to visit him at his bench. In fact, publicity material for the film didn't mention Alfred at all; they were distancing themselves from his depressing story. It wasn't exactly a happy Hollywood ending. </p> <p>I asked him if he had heard from any friends or family since I last saw him. He grabbed an old Toronto Globe and Mail article from one of his suitcases. \"It says that my relation has elapsed. Cut off. In this phase, I am without parents.\" I looked at the article. \"He has taken to saying he has no parents at all,\" it said. </p> <p>Alfred looked away from me for a moment. \"He denied me. Not his son.\" He turned back to watch me write notes. He seemed pleased. \"In 1968 they denied me, said I was not their son, so I left country. My parents, I suppose, are Americans. If Clark Gable says he's my father - I don't accept unless he has documents to prove.\" </p> <p>One of the strangest things about Alfred's situation is that no one from his past has ever come forward. It is as if he had never existed before the day he was first spotted in the airport. Perhaps all of us intrigued by Alfred's story preferred it that way. </p> <p>But once I decided to solve the mystery of who he really was, his acquaintances and family were surprisingly easy to find. </p> <p>Alfred had four brothers and two sisters, all of them middle-class people who lived in Tehran, except for one sister who was a dentist in Luxembourg. One worked in a bank, another was a chemist, another worked for state television and radio. Their father, Abdelkarim, was a physician who worked for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Masjed Suleiman, the birthplace of the Iranian oil industry - just like Alfred had always said. After he retired from the oil company, Abdelkarim moved the family to Tehran. He died in 1967 of cancer when Alfred was 22. </p> <p>It seems the family had known for a long time about Alfred's plight. They were a very well educated family, knew the west well, and read newspapers from abroad. But they apparently always believed that Alfred was living the life he wanted, that he had some kind of master plan. </p> <p>Alfred's closest relative was his brother, Cyrus, who was two years older than him. In their youth, the two boys seemed to have an idyllic childhood in Masjed Suleiman. \"He was close to me and we usually had the same friends,\" he said. \"We were mostly together. We had a good life. I liked swimming and Merhan used to play table tennis. He was very good at it.\" </p> <p>Cyrus was a businessman who imported surgical supplies into Iran. He knew England well. He and his wife, Mina, had lived and worked there for many years. Their son still did. Cyrus was, in fact, responsible for Alfred attending university in Bradford. He was very reluctant to talk, at first. The family thought that Alfred's problem was still only one of papers - and they worried that speaking to me might cause their lost brother problems with the authorities. It seems that the family had no idea of Alfred's fragile mental state. </p> <p>Alfred had lived with Cyrus and Mina for a time in London before moving into a flat of his own. They also lived upstairs from him in Tehran after they got married. At the time he was living with his mother. So Mina knew Alfred - or Merhan, as she scolded me when I used his new name - well. And the portrait both she and her husband painted of him couldn't be more different from the man now sitting on his bench in Terminal One. \"What can I say, he was very normal in every way,\" she said. In every way? She laughed charmingly. \"He was a good-looking man. Some of my friends wanted to be his wife or girlfriend. He had very normal relations with girls. But Merhan chose his own life and I guess it was not a family one.\" </p> <p>We agreed that Merhan was a very intelligent man. \"He was an intellectual. He spent all his time studying and reading books and listening to the radio,\" Mina said. \"He talked all the time about politics. He read books on politics all day and night. It was very important to him. And then he started to do what he believed in.\" </p> <p>One of the key parts of Alfred's story was always his arrest and torture by Savak because of his opposition to the Shah, followed by his deportation to Europe. Cyrus was reluctant to talk about this aspect of Alfred's life. But doing a bit more digging through sources in Iran, I was able to find out what really happened. </p> <p>Apparently, Alfred participated in a student strike at Tehran University in 1970 to object to a new university regulation. Things started to get out of hand and Savak got involved. They questioned all the students and gathered up the ringleaders, about 20, including Alfred. After a few hours of questioning in a university classroom, the matter was apparently dropped. This was evidently Alfred's only serious problem with the security services. </p> <p>There was no arrest, no torture, no confiscation of his passport and no deportation. It was not nearly as dramatic a story as Alfred now remembered. But he must have been scared. He certainly never forgot the incident. </p> <p>The last time Cyrus and Mina saw Alfred was in 1976 when their son was born in England. Alfred had abandoned his studies in Bradford, apparently because his money had run out, according to Mina. (Actually, according to fellow students and teachers I spoke to, Alfred failed his course. They had all wondered what a young Iranian was doing in England studying Serbo Croatian.) </p> <p>He left England to travel through Europe. For a while, he kept in touch, but then his letters stopped coming. With the revolution and then the war with Iraq, his family back home had their own problems to deal with. After four years without any contact, they went to the Foreign Ministry to ask for help trying to find him. \"But we could not find any sign of him,\" said Cyrus. </p> <p>Then in 1991, a family friend came upon Alfred at his bench in the airport. Amazed to find him after all that time, the friend went up to greet him. But Alfred wouldn't acknowledge that he knew him. The same thing happened on other occasions to other family and friends who tried to make contact with him. Finally they stopped trying. Was he ashamed of what he had become? Did the studious boy who loved politics consider himself a failure? Is that why he distanced himself from friends and family? </p> <p>\"Why did he say in the newspaper that his family rejected him?\" asked Mina. \"We do not understand that. That was not true. We thought this was the way he wanted to live. Everyone has his own life and he was going on in his own way. That's what we thought.\" </p> <p>But I was curious - there were still things I wanted to know. The Alfred I knew was mentally ill. Had there ever been signs of it when he was younger? \"No, no, not at all!\" said Mina. \"If there is something wrong with him now, it's not from the past. It must have happened to him there.\" This supported what Alfred's lawyer had said to me. He had arrived sane at the airport. At some point along the way - no one knew quite when - Alfred tipped over into madness. His life was indeed ruined by the absurdities of bureaucracy. </p> <p>And what of Alfred's mother? It turns out that she died only four years ago - at the very time I was filming Here to Where. She knew all about what had happened to her son. And according to Cyrus and Mina, she couldn't understand why he insisted on saying that she was not his mother. It was the great sadness of her life. \"He came from me,\" she told her other children. \"Why does he say that?\" Alfred doesn't know that she is dead. Cyrus is planning to fly to Paris next month to see his long lost brother. Perhaps Alfred's long journey still has another unlikely twist.</p>",

  "<p>Public concern about the direction of research should be taken seriously, one of Britain's leading scientists will warn today. </p> <p>Dame Julia Higgins, president of the British Association, believes that although people support science through taxes, they have very little control over its uses - and often suffer the consequences. </p> <p>\"There is a whole raft of questions about the dual use of science. Knowledge always has a dangerous side, you can use it for good, you can use it for ill.\" </p> <p>Nuclear power and nuclear weapons provided an example. </p> <p>Many people were suspicious of chemicals, forgetting that most of modern life would be impossible without developments in chemistry. This raised questions about the public's trust in science. </p> <p>She called upon the entire science community - including politicians and business leaders trained in science, the \"invisible\" scientists who made careers outside science, and researchers and teachers - to debate the future. </p> <p>She spoke of the \"backlash\" over genetically modified crops, and the potential alarm about the new science of nanotechnology, which deals with fabrics on the scale of millionths of a millimetre. </p> <p>\"We can't have a referendum on every scientific proposal. On the other hand we do have elected representatives; they listen to what the public is thinking. It is quite clear therefore that a publicly articulated, sensible debate, could be extremely helpful,\" she said. </p> <p>\"If people don't know about something, and scientists are not prepared to talk about it, using a language that is understandable, then it is reasonable that people get fearful.\" </p> <p>As a polymer scientist at Imperial College London, she had, in effect, spent her entire career in nanotechnology and had been surprised when other chemists warned of a backlash. What problems could there be? </p> <p>\"There could be toxic problems. But I hadn't thought about them. Shouldn't we think about the potential problems before they become problems?\"</p>",

  "Hundreds of families were searching last night for their children and relatives among the wreckage of Middle School No 1, in hospitals and in the region's morgue. <p>Three days after the bloody end to the Beslan siege, 180 were still listed as missing. </p> <p>Distraught relatives, losing all faith in the ability of local authorities to control the situation, lined the streets with pictures of their missing children in the hope of receiving information from anyone who might have seen them. </p> <p>As the town filled with wailing amid the first burials of the victims, photocopied pictures appeared on the streets around the blasted remains of the school. </p> <p>One, of 12-year-old Aza Gumetsova, bore the words: \"If anyone knows of her whereabouts, please call this number.\" </p> <p>Next to her was pinned a photo of her classmate, Irina Pukhayeva: \"If you saw her after the explosion, please call ...\" </p> <p>The official list of the missing was pasted over the walls of the Palace of Culture. It is a document increasingly laden with dread. </p> <p>Valik Burnatsev and his wife had been there since the siege began five days ago. Yet still he knows nothing of his sister, Elvira, 43, and her daughter, Diana, nine. </p> <p>\"We've looked all over the republic. In the hospitals. With our friends. In the morgue. We've put her name on the list of the missing.\" </p> <p>At the morgue in the regional capital Vladikavkaz, where the dead were gathered for identification, over 120 bodies still lay on the terrace outside in the light rain, their pungent smell filling the air. </p> <p>Some bodies were so burned and blasted as to be unrecognisable to relatives. In the hospitals lay 386 injured, 58 of whom were in a critical condition. </p> <p>Beslan's families, those frantically searching and those already grieving, were yesterday obsessed with the need for a response. In some cases they sought information. In others, revenge. </p> <p>Rumours already began to circulate of acts of revenge. Russian media reported that some locals had headed into neighbouring Ingushetia - from where some of the militants are thought to have come - and abducted 10 Ingush men. </p> <p>Valik Burnatsev's expression cracked into a twisted smile when asked if he thought that there would be more bloodshed. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" he nodded. \"There will be. I know a lot about that.\" Asked what he meant, he looked up at the sky and said : \"Only God can tell you how it will happen.\" </p> <p>Aslan, a local prison official, sat smouldering in his kitchen with two colleagues. </p> <p>His wife and daughter were saved, but he still shares the local anger. </p> <p>He said: \"Today people are burying their dead. But tomorrow there will be something, I know.\" He refused to say what or where. </p> <p>His hatred for the government poured out of him. \"Our [North Ossetian] president is a Natasha\" - local slang for a whore. </p> <p>\"It was absolute chaos during the siege. There was little federal help.\" </p> <p>The president of North Ossetia tearfully apologised for failing to avert the carnage. </p> <p>\"I fully understand my responsibility,\" Alexander Dzasokhov told doctors and relatives of the wounded children in a hospital in Vladikavkaz. \"I want to beg your pardon for failing to protect children, teachers and parents.\" </p> <p>Anger grew towards the Kremlin and the distance it had kept from the hostage crisis. </p> <p>President Putin did not dare meet relatives, who were asleep when he arrived in the middle of the night, nine hours after the siege had finished. </p> <p>He and his two senior security ministers, Rashid Nurgaliyev, the interior minister, and Nikolai Patrushev, head of the security services, paid a brief visit. One local official said Mr Nurgaliyev was there for an hour. </p> <p>During the storming of the school the dead were carried out of the school on stretchers and taken to waiting cars and vans, ambulances being in short supply. </p> <p>Seven of the elite Alfa and nine of the Vimpel special forces units died in the storming of the school, it was reported yesterday. </p> <p>Some of those who are unaccounted for are suspected to be young children in hospital who cannot identify themselves, but many others may have died in the explosions, shooting and fire that swept the school on Friday. </p> <p>Officials say that were were more than 1,100 hostages in the school although the exact number is still not known. Only some of the dead have been identified and it may only be possible to identify many of the bodies through DNA tests. </p> <p>During the siege no secure perimeter was set up by the hundreds of troops in the area, allowing locals into the area as the standoff continued. </p> <p>Even yesterday the chaos continued at the school. The site was open to the public, the grieving or even simply curious clambering over rubble that had a day earlier been the site of intensive mine sapper activity. </p> <p>A policeman crouched next to an unexploded tank shell, part buried in the school's playground, among the stream of visitors. </p> <p>\"Don't tell anyone about this,\" he said. \"Otherwise there will be panic. We've called a sapper, and we'll get rid of it soon.\" </p> <p>An hour later it was gone. </p> <p>The floorboards of the gym had been exposed by the constant scraping of visitors' feet over its black, ashen covering. In the corridors, there remained a child's shoe, exercise books, a blood-covered blackboard wiper, and a child's rucksack. </p> <p>The walls of the schoolrooms had been raked by automatic gunfire. A poster teaching children the vowels O, I, and E, using the Russian words for \"happy\", \"ticket\" and \"eastern\" clung forlornly to the walls. </p> <p>Rescuers had made their final grim discovery late on Saturday night in the basement. A local health official said the bodies of up to 10 children were found there, the site of the final stand of one of the militants. </p> <p>Prosecutors told Interfax last night that bodies of 30 of the 32 hostage takers had been found, and that they were Chechen, Ingush, Kazakh, Arabic and Slav in origin. </p> <p>The whereabouts of the suspected leader, Magomed Yevloyev, were last night unknown. </p> <p>Aslan Maskhadov, the moderate separatist leader of Chechnya, who has been sidelined by the extremists said his movement bore no responsibility for the takeover of the school, and last week's dual airplane explosions and metro blast. He said in a statement that his independence movement would not target innocent civilians. </p> <p>Yesterday the reason for the blast that sparked the storming of the school remained unclear according to official accounts, yet eyewitnesses were insistent that the first explosion was inside the gym. </p> <p>One survivor, Ilfa Gagiyeva, a police investigator, said the explosion was accidental. </p> <p>It happened when one of the mines strung up between the two basketball hoops in the gym fell off its wire and landed on the head of a hostage. </p> <p>The young woman brushed it off her head, and it then exploded when it hit the ground, she said. </p> <p>Then the shooting started.</p>",
  "<p>A lawsuit has been filed against GlaxoSmithKline in the United States seeking refunds for children and adolescents given the antidepressant, Seroxat, following claims that the firm suppressed data showing the drug did not work and increased suicidal tendencies in young people. </p> <p>The class action suit follows an inquiry by New York state attorney general Eliot Spitzer that made similar accusations. </p> <p>Last month GSK settled with Mr Spitzer for $2.5m (\u00a31.4m), without admitting liability. </p> <p>The amount surprised the industry because Mr Spitzer had originally said he wanted to recover all the money GSK had made from selling Seroxat - named Paxil in the US - which analysts have estimated at about \u00a3200m. </p> <p>British regulators have advised doctors not to prescribe drugs like Seroxat for children and adolescents. </p> <p>There are already several class actions against GSK regarding the withdrawal side-effects from Seroxat. </p> <p>Paul Dahlberg, however, who is leading the case at law firm Meshbesher &amp; Spence, said the lawsuit was the first class action intended to reclaim the money paid for the drug based on the alleged suppression of clinical trial data. </p> <p>Mr Dahlberg is now representing at least 24 people who bought the drug for their children and is seeking to recruit the thousands of other Americans who have done so for the class action. </p> <p>The writ alleges GSK hid the results of two clinical trials that showed the drug was no more effective than a placebo in treating depression. In one case, it says, the placebo was more effective than Seroxat. Instead, the lawsuit states, the mixed results from a separate study were published in a scientific journal and used to promote the drug. </p> <p>GSK has defended its process and Alastair Benbow, the firm's European medical director, wrote to the Lancet medical journal this year, giving details of presentations at scientific congresses at which the data was discussed. </p> <p>\"We have made this data available in various forms as is normal practice, that would be via articles in journals, presentations at scientific congresses and letters to doctors,\" a spokesman said. \"We also went to regulatory authorities in May 2003 with all of the paediatric trial result data.\" </p> <p>Additional information in the writ is an internal GSK memo, revealed this year, which said negative trial data should not be given to regulators and its dissemination should be managed \"in order to minimise any potential negative commercial impact\". </p> <p>A spokesman for GSK said the individual's memo did not reflect company policy - as evidenced by the information it had published in the scientific community. </p> <p>The drug was not officially sanctioned by US regulator the food and drug administration for use in under-18s. But doctors were allowed to use their own judgment, based on information letters sent by GSK. The lawsuit claims some of these letters omitted the negative information about the drug. </p> <p>The class action lawsuit was filed in a Minnesota district court last month and is a federal case. The lead plaintiff, Nancy Gerdts, bought the drug for her 12-year-old son in August 2002 and is attempting to get her money back. </p> <p>Because the law firm is still targeting the thousands of people who bought the drug, the amount the class action is seeking to recover is not yet known. Mr Dahlberg said he estimated the claim could be worth as much as $600m. </p> <p>Class action lawsuits relating to drugs have been increasingly common in the US, particularly those involving serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which include Prozac and Seroxat.</p>",
  "Every pensioner aged 75 or over would have the basic state pension boosted by over \u00a3100 a month under plans to be unveiled tomorrow by the Liberal Democrats. <p>The state pension would rise from just under \u00a380 to \u00a3105 a week in a \u00a32.7bn pledge which will be at the centre of the Lib Dems' election campaign.</p> <p>The plan would initially affect the 4 million oldest pensioners, but it is intended that it would ultimately be rolled out to all 11 million. </p> <p>The pledge is designed to tackle poverty among today's pensioners and increase incentives for private saving in the future by reducing means-testing. At present, pensioners with modest savings find they are effectively paying tax of 40% on the first \u00a325 a week of their private pensions. </p> <p>\"We think this will be a massive simplification and will stop people thinking it's not worth saving for their private pension,\" said Steve Webb, the Lib Dems' pensions spokesman. </p> <p>The party hopes the plan will lure those older voters who have been attracted by its pledge to scrap council tax, but who have been less historically inclined to give the Lib Dems their vote. Many of the party's target seats that are currently held by the Conservatives have a high number of older voters. </p> <p>But the Tories also want to retain these voters and have promised to reduce means-testing by raising the basic state pension in line with earnings, not inflation, and boosting it by \u00a37 a week for an individual and \u00a311 a week for a couple. </p> <p>Tomorrow's proposal is just one of a series aimed at boosting confidence in pensions which has been badly shaken by the Equitable Life crisis and by the experience of up to 80,000 workers who lost out on company pensions when employers went bankrupt. </p> <p>The government has sought to restore confidence in the latter case with the establishment of the pension protection fund, but the combination of an ageing population, the wholesale dumping of \"final salary pension\" schemes by private employers and the Equitable Life crisis has generated widespread concern. </p> <p>The Lib Dems believe a massive overhaul is needed with increased openness, simplicity and flexibility. \"Pensions need to be simple, flexible and reliable\" said Mr Webb. \"So much of pensions is rooted in the industry of the 60s and the family structure of the 40s and we need a pension system that fits with the modern world.\" </p> <p>Under his plans, the Lib Dems would modernise the pensions system by allowing people to check their future \"pension balances\" via cashpoint machines, and annual forecasts would be given to everyone paying into a private pension. </p> <p>In addition, in a proposal also mooted by the Tories, the requirement that those with private pensions buy an annuity at 75 would be removed. </p> <p>The Lib Dems would also offer a new, low-cost personal pension run by National Savings to assuage fears after Equitable Life. The Treasury is thought to think this could be an unfair challenge to the private pensions industry, but Mr Webb said such a move would curb what he called \"the crisis in saving\".</p>",
  "I arrived in the cramped basement of the Washington Surgi-Clinic at eight o'clock on a Saturday morning. Birth-control brochures and women's magazines were scattered throughout the waiting room. I lay down on my side, on one of the padded benches that lined the wall. Nausea and fatigue blotted out everything else. <p>It was the start of the July 4 weekend, two summers ago, and I was there for a \"no-frills\" abortion, provided by the clinic for $400. Four other women were there - young women, most with mothers or friends, one with a man who appeared to be her boyfriend. At 37, I had a good 15 years on any of them. I had been married for seven years, my husband and I had good jobs, and I was pregnant - isn't that what women my age wanted? </p> <p>While I had never exactly yearned to have a baby, I had always assumed that eventually I would. I loved my husband, William, and wanted to spend my life with him; not to have a child, it seemed, would be to leave a piece of the picture missing. Although choices about the \"when\" and \"how many\" of having children have changed a great deal for women like me over the past couple of decades, the \"whether\" has not. The media oozes it: having a family makes you whole. Look out or you will become one of those miserable women in their 30s and 40s, desperate to get pregnant, to adopt a baby from China. Motherhood still seems less a choice than a sine qua non . </p> <p>William said he wanted to have a child at some vague point in the future, and I believed him. But the years went by, and it was never the right time. \"When I finish my dissertation,\" he would say. \"When I get hired.\" After he got a job teaching philosophy at a local university, the answer was, \"After I write my book.\" We avoided lengthy conversation on the topic, probably because we both sensed that the outcome would be something neither of us wanted to face. </p> <p>In fact, in those last years of the marriage, we weren't talking much about anything. Our relationship was disintegrating, like a satellite slowly breaking apart in the atmosphere and falling to earth. We argued daily about everything, from my leaving a stray tea bag in the sink to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I would threaten to leave him. He would ask me not to, tell me things would get better. The hallway of the apartment we had moved into a year ago was still stacked with cardboard boxes; we had never even finished unpacking. </p> <p>Years ago I had fallen in love with William - a charming, good-looking and outstanding teacher - but even then I knew that he was obsessed with his work. It took me longer to see his other obsession: pointing out my shortcomings. He criticised the way I talked, walked and dressed. He was unkind to me most of the time - not abusive, but impatient, or, alternately, neglectful. I had grown up around men I was afraid of - my father was a frustrated academic whose unpredictable rages sent me scurrying to hide in my room - so it didn't seem that extraordinary. And, of course, I thought I loved him too much to live without him. Absent a catalyst like an affair or a drug problem and a bad relationship can grind on for a very long time. </p> <p>Meanwhile the desire to have a child burned a separate, parallel path in my mind throughout my mid-30s. I was consumed with the fear that it was too late, that I would not be able to get pregnant at my age. My younger sister had become pregnant several months before, piquing my envy and anxiety. That spring, I began using an ovulation predictor kit, expecting it to demonstrate that my fertility was on the blink. But it didn't. William and I actively tried to conceive. If that sounds irrational, it was; no doubt he, like me, felt terribly unhappy in the marriage, yet found the idea of splitting up unthinkable. </p> <p>That year, over Memorial Day weekend, I went to California to visit my sister and her new baby. I noticed how much calmer and happier I felt without William there criticising me, bickering with me. I went home, thinking about the possibility of life without him. </p> <p>One evening not long after I returned, I doubled over with abdominal pain and threw up so violently that I thought I had food poisoning. William took me to the doctor the next day. We navigated a maze of offices in the medical building as I went from one doctor to another, taking one test after another. </p> <p>William was impatient. Emergencies or crises of any kind, agitated him. He testily criticised me for not being assertive enough with the receptionists and not being articulate enough with the doctors. In the waiting room he began reading the book he had brought, ignoring me. </p> <p>Eventually we were seated in an exam room, and the doctor came in and said, \"You're pregnant.\" My first reaction was a fleeting giddiness - I had done it! - immediately followed by the conviction that I did not want to, could not, raise a child with William. If this was the way he treated me when I was sick and in pain, how could I depend on him during a pregnancy, and in the years thereafter? </p> <p>I spent most of the next few weeks floating seasick on the bed or the couch. I went through all my miserable options: single parenthood, separating but having the child, not having the child or staying with my husband and giving birth. I never felt a moment of utter clarity; just a consistent pull toward the conclusion that I could not have a child with William, could not count on him to treat me with respect, could not by way of a child yoke myself to him for the next 20 years. </p> <p>And, with or without William, the idea of having a child overwhelmed me. I had few local friends or family, and lived in a city I detested. And, yes, I was selfish: the prospect of having a child and raising it on my own felt insurmountable, like the end of my life. For a woman like me who had lived an independent life, the idea of giving birth and raising children began to seem almost a retro, labour-intensive enterprise, like growing your own vegetables or sewing your own clothes. There is a reason why women in the 1960s and 70s tried to escape this way of life - it is hard work, and it is not for everybody. </p> <p>Yet when I suggested terminating the pregnancy, I hoped, against all the evidence, that William would pull me back from the precipice, assure me that we would work things out, that he would take care of me. He didn't. Panicked about the impact a child would have on his career, he readily agreed to an abortion. I scheduled the procedure for the earliest date I could have it. </p> <p>It took another year and a half before William and I could untangle our lives and separate. The abortion blindsided me: humiliated and humbled, I could not believe that I was capable of terminating an intentional pregnancy. My big fear had been that we would be biologically unable to have a child; it turned out that we were emotionally unable to do so. </p> <p>The abortion never troubled my husband deeply: it wasn't his body; he had never wanted a child all that much to begin with. While I don't regret ending that pregnancy, it still hurts to be childless. I shut the door on motherhood, quite possibly for ever, and in the starkest way possible. </p> <p>When, as happens with ever-increasing frequency these days, a friend announces that she and her partner are expecting, it quietly knocks the wind out of me. When I come home from spending a long weekend with my raucous two-year-old niece, my apartment seems filled with too much quiet, empty space. At those moments, I tell myself that I have ruined my life. It's not that simple, though.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Laura Walters is a pseudonym.

  "<p>HBOS questioned yesterday the impartiality of the European Union's competition commissioner, Mario Monti, after he made comments that appeared to be favourable to a bid for Abbey National by the Spanish bank Santander Central Hispano. </p> <p>The European commission has yet to complete an inquiry into the proposed takeover deal. HBOS is expected to decide this week whether to launch a rival offer for Abbey, following the Spanish bank's bid in July. </p> <p>\"At first glance, it [a Santander-Abbey merger] is a contribution to the objective of the commission of having a more integrated financial services market,\" Mr Monti was quoted by news agency Reuters as saying at a conference in Italy. It is a political goal of the EU to make financial services markets operate on a Europe-wide basis. </p> <p>Mr Monti is studying the deal because of its size. HBOS has also asked him to look at the holdings Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander have in each other's stock. </p> <p>The commission is due to rule on whether Banco Santander can bid for Abbey by September 17 but is widely expected to approve the deal. </p> <p>The EU wants to integrate financial services across Europe on the basis that such a move would make the market operate more effectively than the current, very divided national markets. Mr Monti commenting on the Abbey takeover in the context of European integration, however, brought an allegation of a lack of impartiality in the EU investigation from HBOS. </p> <p>\"We are very surprised at that comment,\" said a spokesman for HBOS. \"The commission has yet to make a decision about whether to approve a bid for Abbey from Santander. Comments of that nature are concerning. They appear to suggest that it is not an impartial process, as it should be. </p> <p>\"If that is indeed his comment, we will be taking that up with the commission. It is surprising that the commissioner would be speaking favourably about [the deal] ... it doesn't smack of an impartial process.\" </p> <p>Nobody was available for comment yesterday at Mr Monti's office. The commissioner is leaving his post later this year. </p> <p>The board of HBOS is expected to meet this week to decide whether to launch an estimated \u00a310bn bid for Abbey, and trump the Spanish bank's \u00a38bn offer. A spokesman would not confirm the meeting and said there was no certainty that it would bid. </p> <p>HBOS is expected to look at a report by law firm Allen &amp; Overy on whether the deal would be blocked by regulators; HBOS and Abbey together would have about 35% of the mortgage market. It has also been calculated that 70% of Abbey and Halifax branches are within 400 metres of one another. </p> <p>It is likely a bid from HBOS would lead to a protracted inquiry by competition regulators, so HBOS's bid would have to be sufficiently attractive to shareholders to put up with the wait. A lengthy investigation into a proposed takeover of Abbey by Lloyds TSB ended in the regulators blocking the deal in 2001. </p> <p>Abbey has been struggling over the past few years to halt a slide in its market share and is still recovering from a foray into wholesale banking by previous management.</p>",
  "<p>They are renowned for not talking or showering as much as their parents would like, but now teenage boys are in the vanguard of an internet publishing revolution. </p> <p>While their sisters have always had an abundance of print, and now web, magazines, teenage boys have never had a title or portal to call their own. That is until the middle of this month when the creators of the teenage girl portal <a href=\"http://www.Mykindaplace.com\">Mykindaplace.com</a> are due to launch <a href=\"http://www.Monkeyslum.com\">Monkeyslum.com</a>. </p> <p>Claiming it will be funny and irreverent, the team insist the site will achieve at least 125,000 unique users in its first month and will provide the best solution for any advertiser wishing to reach school age boys. </p> <p>\"Teenage boys are notoriously difficult to reach,\" admits Charlie Redmayne, managing director of Mykindaplace and Monkeyslum. \"They get into a particular hobby and devour magazines on the subject but don't find a commonality of interests like girls do. A girl might be into horses, say, but will still be into fashion, music, gossip, makeup and boys. </p> <p>\"There has been a change, though, which we think makes it the right time for a general site for boys. They're now far more interested in lifestyle than they used to be because they get involved in the lives of their football or film heroes and want to know what clothes they're wearing, who they're dating, which clubs they use and what they drink, and so on.\" </p> <p>Hence the Mykindaplace team, mainly comprised of former advertising executives, decided they could do for boys what they have already done for girls and give them all the football, cars, computer games and general interest content they could ever want under one roof. At the same time, they will be creating a captive audience for advertisers that, in Redmayne's opinion, are fed up with advertising through hobby magazines that are read by a wide age group. </p> <p>\"We know that the only way you can reach teenage boys is through the men's magazines like FHM, because they aspire to be older, or special interest titles,\" Redmayne says. \"The obvious problem with that is you reach a lot of men from all age groups at the same time so you're not getting value for money from your budget.\" </p> <p>As the first launch of a portal specifically aimed at teenage boys, Monkeyslum is attracting a lot of attention from the publishing and advertising industry. </p> <p>Whether they believe the launch will be successful or not, all are agreed that while the team behind it are obviously keen to win over advertisers, making sure the content on the site is \"engaging\" will be key, as William Makower, founder of digital marketing agency Panlogic, explains. </p> <p>\"We've done a lot of work on how the brands we represent can reach teenage boys because it's such a huge untapped market. The problem is that, because they're so focused, a site like Monkeyslum will have to provide great depth to the content it puts on the site, while at the same time it will have to provide a lot of breadth to cover the relevant areas. So, that's going to be a difficult one - breadth and depth at the same time.\" </p> <p>As Monkeyslum is part-owned by Sky, the team are hinting that they have a useful resource for sports information and news, and have signed a deal with publisher Highbury House for gaming content. </p> <p>Central to the Monkeyslum team's argument that they can bridge a demographic divide nobody has spanned before is the idea that they will buy in top content and then complement it with stories from a dedicated editorial team based at their offices. It has been tried, competitors say, and the closure this year of Sorted magazine is testimony to how difficult a market Monkeyslum is aiming at. </p> <p>James Carter, publishing director of FHM (print and online), warns that teenage boys will be very difficult to win over with \"repurposed content\". FHM has not considered tapping in to the market with a junior version of its magazine, he insists, because its average 25-year-old male reader is far more of an attractive option for advertisers to reach. </p> <p>\"Until you can pay for goods online through your mobile, Monkeyslum won't be able to offer any e-commerce, like we do, because teenagers don't have credit cards,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Their main problem is going to be that the web doesn't really operate like they're trying to make it work. People would love there to be a single site people get their information from - but what will always happen is if somebody wants to read a match report they'll go to a football site, if they want to read about a computer game, they'll go to the relevant service. </p> <p>\"People come to <a href=\"http://www.FHM.com\">FHM.com</a> to be entertained because they know our brand and the voice we write stories in. If you take content that's already available in other places I can't see how you can then present it as quirky and zany when it's already appeared in a place where it was presented as mainstream. I can't see how they're going to build a brand.\" </p> <p>It is a concern shared by Jon Holt, director of PR firm Golin Harris. While any publicist would welcome a new site that makes it easier to target teenage boys, Holt believes that monkeyslum will face big problems. </p> <p>\"The main thing is they need to remember that a brand is a promise and if you fail to deliver that promise, you're in trouble. I can't see how they're going to build that brand of zany irreverence if it's based on content boys can get elsewhere. It sounds like they could end up putting a brand at the top and then have content underneath it that doesn't fit.\" </p> <p>The other area where Holt believes the site will have to tread carefully is sex. As kids are well known for buying magazines that are meant for older readers, he predicts the site will face a difficult question soon after launch. </p> <p> \"All the girls' magazines know they have to be salacious to get readers,\" he says. \"They're clever enough to partner a story about blow jobs with some other article that's serious and educational. As there hasn't been a magazine for teenage boys, I wonder how soon Monkeyslum is going to find out their readers are into the smutty stuff. Then they're going to have to decide if that's what they want to provide. It will be tempting for them as they're obviously working on getting as many teenage boys as possible, so they appeal to advertisers.\" </p> <p>Monkeyslum's Redmayne promises that the site will never feature soft porn and has been in active discussions with the government to double check that its content is responsible rather than salacious. He also believes that the chat side of the site will allow teenage boys to ask questions anonymously that they would never dare raise with peers. </p> <p>It is this side of the launch that Damian Burns, head of digital at advertising agency Zed Media, believes will ensure it is a success: \"We find when we're researching teenage boys for our clients that they love to use chatrooms and bulletin boards. So, I would say Monkeyslum is a very welcome move for advertisers because I can assure you we all know that at the moment whenever we want to target teenage boys as much of 80% of the budget can be wasted reaching older men. </p> <p>\"It's good timing because teenage boys have come on a long way in the last couple of decades. They are becoming far more savvy about brands, just like girls have always been, and want to make sure they've got the right gear. The days of being happy with a bottle of Old Spice at Christmas are long gone.\"</p>",

  "<p>Robert, Kay and Alan are three \"ordinary\" people, which means they're not politicians. One is boss of a communications company, the next is managing director of a design agency and the third a business development advisor. But in <strong>Crisis Command: Could You Run the Country?</strong> (BBC2, Sunday) they're handed the reins of government for a simulated national emergency. On hand to help are \"three genuine experts\", one of whom is Amanda Platell. She, of course, was William Hague's spin doctor, so she knows a thing or two about dealing with a crisis. </p> <p>There has been an outbreak of deadly plague in Liverpool and our amateur cabinet has to make snap decisions - about how much of the city to seal off, about whether to deploy the army, about whether to release an untested vaccine - in order to stop it turning into a major national, even international, catastrophe. Gavin Hewitt, who presents the show, heaps on the pressure, urging them to hurry up because this is not just a debate - they are dealing with people's lives. </p> <p>But Robert, Kay and Alan do brilliantly. They think things through, argue it all out, and more often than not they make the right decision, in spite of some rotten advice from Amanda Platell. A global pandemic is averted. </p> <p>It makes you wonder where we would be if Robert, Kay and Alan had been really running the country for the past 18 months or so. Here are all the intelligence reports, here are some military experts to say what kind of war it will be and how long it will last, here are your PR experts to say how it will all go down, now should we? Or not? </p> <p>I like this show, but I'd like to see a parallel project, a programme called Could You Do a Real Job? Real job could mean traffic warden, shelf stacker and nappy changer and the first three contestants could be, for example, called Tony, Gordon and Jack. While they were filming, the reins - the real ones, not the makey-uppy ones - could be handed to Robert, Kay and Alan. And then, if we liked what they did, we could make their positions permanent - vote them in, just by hitting the red button on the remote control. </p> <p>Or the country could just be handed over to Nicky Clarke to run. Because the way to the roots of a nation's problems is through its hair. Well, that's what you might think from watching <strong>Storyville: The Beauty Academy of Kabul</strong> (BBC2, Saturday). </p> <p>A bunch of well-intentioned American women open up the first hair and beauty school in the Afghan capital, as a sort of two-fingered salute to some of the country's archaic practices, and in particular to the old Taliban regime. It's like The Salon, but moved to Kabul. No, that's not fair. This, as Storyville documentaries always are, is a classy film - beautifully shot and understated, with none of that unnecessary narration nonsense. </p> <p>My problem was that I found the well-meaning Americans so ghastly. \"All those who have makeup on stand up!\" shouts the loudest of them, to a class of Afghan women, most of whom don't stand up. They aren't wearing any makeup and look lovely. The American is and doesn't. </p> <p>\"Why aren't the rest of them wearing makeup?\" she demands, to the translator. \"You know what, you're stuck in a rut, guys,\" she yells at them. \"You're stuck in a hole of the past that you can't get out of, and my God, before I leave here you're getting out of the hole.\" It's interesting she feels in a position to lecture these lovely women about beauty. </p> <p><strong>Quite Ugly One Morning</strong> (ITV1, Sunday), a black comedy starring Yellow Pages actor James Nesbitt, was a giggle. It started promisingly, with Nesbitt walking in on his doctor neighbour's flat to find him not just with his throat slit but with two of his fingers cut off and rammed up his nostrils. Plus a turd on the sideboard. And that's the sort of vein it carried on in - more death (human and canine), more damage to fingers, plenty of laughs, an implausibly young and attractive detective sergeant and an equally implausible but charming plot involving, as well as murder, the evils of NHS privatisation. </p> <p>But Jimmy, you're going to have to cut back on the Yellow Pages ads. I kept thinking you were going to turn up at the police station and say, \"Some eeejit's cut my neighbour's throat!\"</p>",
  "<p>No caped crusaders they say, just neatly-coiffed figures in pinstripe suits and freshly laundered shirts. </p> <p>But that has not stopped the Law Society from spending tens of thousands of pounds to convince us that, however unlikely it may seem, the latest heroes for these unheroic times are solicitors. </p> <p>\"My hero - my solicitor\" is the slogan to be unveiled to commuters in a Law Society poster campaign designed to persuade people going through life crises that a solicitor is just the person to ride to their rescue. </p> <p>Posters will appear over the next five weeks at Newcastle, York and Leamington railway stations, and Euston and London Bridge tube stations in London. </p> <p>The series of four posters illustrates hypothetical cases - in which solicitors sorted out the problems of an employee with job difficulties, a trader whose business hit the rocks, a father denied contact with his children, and a sick mother-of-three threatened with losing her home. </p> <p>The pressure group Fathers4Justice would no doubt point out that the scenario involving the dad who manages to see his children every other weekend after being denied access for three years plays down the serious problems in the family justice system. </p> <p>These have provoked high-profile protests from fathers and even calls for radical change from senior judges. </p> <p>\"Hero\" may not be a word uttered much these days, at least without irony. But in market testing, 73% of people in London described the ads as \"believable\"; 70% also said they were helpful in telling people how to find a solicitor, by consulting the Law Society's website. </p> <p>Janet Paraskeva, the society's chief executive, said: \"In a market where legal services are increasingly available from unqualified people, we want to remind the public about the benefits of using a solicitor. </p> <p>\"All solicitors are highly trained, properly qualified and insured, so clients know they are protected if things go wrong.\" </p> <p>The campaign comes as new rules allow the public to consult barristers direct - without going through a solicitor -though the Bar has not publicised the change widely. </p> <p>Curiously, although the typical solicitor is still a white male, there are none featured in the posters. </p> <p>Of some 92,000 practising solicitors, around 36,000 are women and 7,000 come from ethnic minorities. Yet three out of four of the poster solicitors - represented by models-- belong to ethnic minorities, and half are women. </p> <p>A spokesman for the society said: \"Nearly 8% of the profession is made up of people from ethnic minorities, which reflects society at large. </p> <p>\"Recent surveys show that about 20% of young people entering the profession are from ethnic minorities.\" </p> <p>The poster campaign follows an ICM survey of 1,000 people two years ago, commissioned by RAC Legal Services, which found that nearly half those questioned believed solicitors were arrogant, slow and incompetent, and a quarter thought them \"positively untrustworthy\". </p> <p>However, while solicitors as a class generally do poorly in opinion polls, most clients rate their own solicitors highly in surveys.</p>",
  "Did you buy a paper? I asked my daughter. No, she said with a grimace and shudder. \"I couldn't face it, I didn't want to read about it\". <p>The \"it\", of course, was Beslan, and hundreds of children like my daughter's children, like your children, lying in that charnel-house of a gym. The first day of school, the crisp new uniforms, the songs and clasped hands, then terrible fear and death. A universal nightmare seemingly beyond scripting or imagining. But now that we have seen it again and again on 24-hour news, now that the plumes of smoke and the naked kids running are images scarred on our brains, what does it mean? </p> <p>The danger, the real danger for professional politicians, professional journalists, professional know-alls everywhere, is not sensing the difference. So Boris Yeltsin was wrong to invade Chechnya a decade ago, and Vladimir Putin was wrong to play the hardest of hard men, and his crack troops cracked up. Wiser international counsels had better prevail. </p> <p>So, fine: but also, so what? Human revulsion slams the door on expertise and reason. These could have been our children. Perhaps, one malign day, they will be our children. And if there is such evil, then perhaps there is also something called an international terrorist conspiracy. </p> <p>Scant evidence, in all rationality, still buttresses that belief. Arabs among the Beslan corpses? Maybe, but Putin would say that, wouldn't he? Join Mother Russia in its \"full scale\" battle for democracy, truth and justice in the style and wake of Father Texas? Stroll on ... but don't stroll through the smoking ruins of Grozny, don't open your history books too wide. There are no simplicities here except the ultimate simplicity of total horror. But that may be enough. </p> <p>For the difficult, inescapable thing, watching those pictures, is an eery feeling of manipulation. Somebody planned this and reckoned the cameras would be there. Take a panning shot of Middle School No 1, go in close on the gym, frame the fleeing children from handy roof tops and let's see plenty of greenery, let's make Beslan like downtown Smallville or Littlehampton. We seemed to look down on a leafy stage set for carnage; and someone knew we would be watching. </p> <p>Perhaps, in another life, that someone might have found other uses for his talents: orchestrating Republican conventions or the backdrops at Brighton next month. He could have been super spin doctor, feted and interviewed. But instead, in the service of Chechnya, he sat alone in a darkened room and thought hard. </p> <p>What kind of outrage makes world news these days? Those early al-Qaida bomb blasts in Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi seem pretty outdated now to be honest, just big bangs with loads of dead, no pictures beyond more destruction. Who cares about blowing holes in ships or trains? The wonder of 9/11 was the pictures, the twin towers toppling. Play it again, Sam. Osama had made No 1. </p> <p>How do you follow that? By seizing a Moscow theatre, maybe, by making a stage your stage. Putin couldn't pretend that wasn't happening; the curtain rose on his front doorstep. But the trouble was that the theatre doors were locked, that the cameras couldn't peer inside. You had to rely on imagination - on the thought that this could be Broadway or the West End - and it wasn't enough. You needed a brand new wheeze. </p> <p>Politicians and their intelligence advisers, of course, are always wittering on about WMD. They read Tom Clancy and multiply the threat because that's their particular obsession. It is what seems real to them. But why bother hitting Wall Street, or even Walsall, with hi-tech trappings when there are so many easier pickings on offer? </p> <p>Beslan, North Ossetia. What kind of dateline is that? An obscure town near the Chechen border. A suitable target for infiltration, no nuclear scientists required. Just take a school hostage and see what happens. </p> <p>Hostage-taking on a grand scale means time, among other things: time for the camera teams to arrive, time for the crisis and pressure to build. Will Putin give in? He can't. It would be the end of him. So it will all come to slaughter and bitter tears. But he'll have to let CNN, BBC and the rest see what happens if he wants to make this terrorism international. And then the world will, too, see what we Chechens can do. </p> <p>Someone, that someone, wrote the script. Someone with despair in his heart calculated how it would work out - and break from behind the borders of control that stop us seeing what happens inside Chechnya. Someone wanted to put his case on the international map. Mission accomplished. </p> <p>And for his next trick? An old peoples' home, a nursery, a hospital? There is no limit to the targets that may be chosen by terrorists who expect to die but know that they will make a splash in the process. There is no limit to the soft touches that cannot be anticipated or defended. Frontiers are meaningless, because pictures have no frontier. Fear needs no visa. </p> <p>Two bleak things follow. One is that - whether or not it exists on any organised level - we shall gradually come to identify a force called international terrorism, a force defined not by the coordination of its strikes or creeds but by the orchestration of its inhuman propaganda. I manipulate, therefore I exist. </p> <p>The other thing is self-knowledge for media-makers and media-watchers. If the malignant message is itself a device, a weapon of mass hysteria, how do we defuse it? By a suppression that undermines free society, that gives terror its victory? Or by the realisation that we are not puppets, that we must see and explain for ourselves. That we have a duty of understanding. </p>",
  "<p>If you're a bloke, you won't remember much about the Mitsubishi Colt ad, except perhaps that the car is driven by a steamy 20-something blonde. If you're female you'll have noted how irritatingly tiny this \"more than just a pretty face\" of a car is, that the woman is driving it underwater, that three men in white lab coats are watching her through the aquarium glass and they are grinning like hell. </p> <p>Why? Because she's top totty? Because they are pleased with the car's performance? It is ambiguous. Either way, you'll probably feel irked and patronised. </p> <p>The Yellow Pages ad featuring a hapless James Nesbitt incapable of sorting out his life on his own is also irritating. It stereotypes men as incompetent, which is not a message women especially want to be peddled. Because if men are incompetent, women end up running the show, which is presumably why the Bounty kitchen paper ad features a man in drag. Real men don't, or can't, clean floors. </p> <p>Strange, then, that marketing analysts would have us believe we now live in a golden age of androgyny. Gender roles, they say, are fluid, blurred. Targeting men and women as separate species, one lot from Mars, the other from Venus, is, they say, as over as 80s shoulder pads or 90s ladettes. So why do so many ads try to speak to women as if they are a sisterhood of Stepford wives? Why do advertisers think that women only drive small cars? Do they really think that they buy things, such as Gillette's Venus razor, because they are pink? Nearly 50% of women dislike how they are portrayed in advertising, according to the Future Foundation, compared with 37% of men. Surprise, surprise. </p> <p>Next month, Rethink Pink, the UK's first annual conference looking at the female consumer, is being held in London. The aim is to steer industry insiders away from lame stereotypes and towards a sharper understanding of both our shifting cultural values and the modern female consumer in all her complex glory. Only then will they win her loyalty, and a market share of her increasing spending power. </p> <p>\"Adding just a splash of pink to your products and marketing material is not the way to go in targeting what is a highly educated and sophisticated audience,\" says Peter Frost of Rethink Pink. Women, according to Frost, influence over 85% of global consumer decision-making, purchase over 50% of new vehicles, comprise 40% of business travellers and start 35% of new businesses. </p> <p>\"The zeitgeist has completely changed,\" says Caroline Whitehall, director of research and strategy consultancy Acacia Avenue. \"Traditional business has been about male values. Women as well as men have endorsed that. In the 90s everyone talked about the crisis of masculinity. We are post that. We no longer live in a masculine or feminine society. </p> <p>\"There are now a lot of feminine cues being used in business and therefore becoming endorsed by business. BT's It's Good to Talk campaign in 1994 marked a shift towards this endorsement of female values, says Whitehall. \"Society frowns on small talk, on female chatter. Big talk, what men do, is fighting talk. It means something. To get men, as well as women, to talk on the phone you need to endorse small talk. And that's what the campaign did.\" </p> <p>The market research consultancy Breaking Trends talks about the feminisation of the global village, from the boardroom to the bedroom and the marketplace. Feminine values are no longer marginalised; instead they are centre stage. Whitehall agrees: \"Think of the Egg campaign, with its soft, simple, feminine values,\" she says, \"compared to male-style companies like Lloyds TSB with its logo of a black horse. It's powerful, bold, masculine.\" And rather old-fashioned. </p> <p>\"You couldn't get a better example of our acceptance of female values than Nadia in Big Brother,\" says Whitehall. \"She is loved by the nation. If that's not an indicator of the shift that's going on then I don't know what is.\" </p> <p>Advertising, meanwhile, is in danger of looking like a cross between Pollyanna and PC Plod: fuddy-duddy, out of touch and reliant on gender stereotypes. \"It is time to catch up,\" says Jonathan Mildenhall, managing director of TBWA in London, whose campaigns include French Connection, Wonderbra, the Labour party and Whiskas. </p> <p>\"Otherwise advertising will get left behind. Broadcasters and media owners are giving a much more accurate reflection of the multifaceted lives of women today. Look at Channel 4 programming or the content of Heat, of Glamour and Cosmopolitan versus ads on TV or in the press. The editorial and broadcast content is much more real. Ads always fall back to comfortable stereotypes. But today's women can't be pigeonholed. </p> <p>\"A 35- or 45-year-old woman today is buying the same clothes as her daughters. She's buying a cookbook for her own diet, not her husband's dinner. She is reading magazines that have intimate, explicit content. She is watching shows like Sex and the City. </p> <p>\"But the advertising that sandwiches all of this is really bland. It tries to package her up as a housewife. The idea of marketing to women as a single homogenous group is as archaic as marketing to white men. </p> <p>\"We need to be much more sensitive to our attitudinal marketing, to be cleverer and braver in what we portray in advertising so it doesn't continue to play a passive role in between the editorial or TV content in between. We need to be braver.\" </p> <p>That bravery can misfire. Pampers has just launched its first ad featuring a man in sole charge of a baby. Very touching. But note that the dad does not actually change a nappy. He's just in the same room as the baby. The very fact that this ad is seen by Procter &amp; Gamble as a radical departure surely shows how advertising is one step behind reality. </p> <p>\"We have dared to show a man,\" says Pampers brand manager David Jones. \"A few years ago Pampers ads would feature men in white jackets. The aim of this ad is to put Pampers in a relevant situation; 64.5% of women are now working. There are times in the day, especially at the end of the day, when the man has to change that nappy. That's something that actually happens. </p> <p>\"In terms of a communication message, if we were to be talking exclusively about a mother and baby, we would not be reflecting what is going on out there.\" </p> <p>The ad does not, he says, expect men to go out and buy the nappies. \"We would not make that leap. In terms of who is going into the supermarket and making the purchases, it's largely the mother.\" </p> <p>So much for the new androgyny. \"Women still control the majority of brand shopping,\" says William Nelson of the Future Foundation. \"Not that much has changed. You still need to target women.\" </p> <p>They are responsible for grocery shopping in 47% of couples, according to a British Household Panel Study. When men do go off to the supermarket, 21% of them are armed with a list - written by the woman. Patronise her at your peril. </p> <p>It is the \"female prosumer\", or professional consumer, says Glenda Stone, CEO of Aurora, which analyses women's work, spending and investment patterns, who is the most misunderstood. </p> <p>\"The female prosumer is hugely economically discerning. She is a well-informed, independent spender. She is making purchasing decisions all day long, from the tissues she is buying on the way to work to where she will spend her Nasdaq millions. </p> <p>\"The power of the purse has risen significantly. Her marriage spend is even greater than her individual spend. It's not the guys who buy the ties. The marketplace has been sleepy in terms of marketing to women as one generic homogenous group. They've walloped them together into a single aggregate. But women are all different,\" she says, adding that 200,000 of them now own small businesses. </p> <p>Like Stone herself, many may own a Porsche, not a Mini Cooper. Stone doesn't buy into the idea of a brave new androgynous culture. Marketing to men and women as if they spoke the same language won't work. \"It does depend on the product, but women want to be treated specially, and to be understood.\" </p> <p>The male psyche, on the other hand, is sewn up, says TBWA's Jonathan Mildenhall. \"We get it right with men so many times. That's because we are braver. We have a fat northern man telling jokes,\" he says, referring to the John Smith campaign featuring comedian Peter Kay. \"Men relate to it. We have so many wine and beer brands targeting women, but we adopt saccharine stereotypes. </p> <p>\"It is not politically correct to capitalise on the difference between men and women. They are marked 'Handle With Care': we don't want to offend them so we bland down when we target women and end up producing vanilla advertising.

  "A British soldier who had served in Kosovo and Iraq has been shot dead just four hours after returning to the UK to celebrate his mother's birthday in what appeared to be a bungled robbery. <p>Neral Sharpe, of the Queen's Royal Hussars, bled to death after being hit once in the stomach in the early hours of Saturday in a car park near his family's home in Smethwick, West Midlands. </p> <p>The 20-year-old had taken leave from his base in Germany to celebrate his 21st birthday and his mother's 40th. As he parked his car at around 4.30am witnesses say another man approached him and tried to grab the soldier's gold chain. </p> <p>After a struggle both men fell to the floor and a single shot was heard. While Private Sharpe lay bleeding, his attacker is believed to have removed the soldier's chain and walked off. Private Sharpe was taken to hospital where he later died. </p> <p>Last night Private Sharpe's mother, Gail, said her son had never been in trouble before. </p> <p>\"He was a polite and family-loving boy and he served his country with bravery,\" she said. \"He put his life on the line in so many dangerous places, it is just terrible to think something like this could happen so close to home.\" </p> <p>Mrs Sharpe added: \"I have been told that his gold chain that he used to wear around his neck was missing when police officers arrived at the scene. Three people who saw what went on have come forward to the police. One said they actually saw the man make a grab for the chain. Neral put his hands up to try and protect himself, a small struggle began and then he was shot.\" </p> <p>Private Sharpe had served in some of the world's most dangerous regions during his army career. He was in Kosovo between 2001 and 2002 and subsequently in Basra in southern Iraq from November 2003 to April this year. </p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Andy Hough of the West Midlands police, said that although he could not confirm that theft was the motive, a man in his early 20s had been arrested. </p> <p>\"If he has been shot as the result of a robbery going wrong, a shooting of this kind would be both unusual and worrying,\" he told the Times. </p> <p>Detectives are now examining CCTV footage to piece together Private Sharpe's exact movements. </p> <p>\"The circumstances are quite bizarre in that Mr Sharpe had literally just arrived in the country,\" said Detective Chief Inspector Hough.</p>",
  "Turkey's devout Muslim leader, Tayyip Erdogan, has defended his government's plans to criminalise adultery, despite protests that have shown the issue is dividing the country. <p>Mr Erdogan, whose AK party has its roots in political Islam, said at the weekend that outlawing marital infidelity is a vital step towards preserving the family and \"human honour\". Although Turkey aspires to join the European Union it did not have to adopt its \"imperfect\" western morals, he insisted. </p> <p>\"The family is a sacred institution for us. The stronger the family, the stronger the country. If the family is weakened, that country is doomed to destruction,\" the prime minister said in an interview with Turkey's Sabah newspaper. </p> <p>The proposal, which has infuriated feminists and much of the media, is likely to cloud talks in Ankara today between Mr Erdogan and the European enlargement commissioner, G\u00fcnter Verheugen. </p> <p>A similar anti-adultery law was overturned by the country's constitutional court in 1996 on the grounds that it unfairly penalised women. </p> <p>With Turkey under pressure to expand women's rights, the plan \"could harm [its] image,\" said an EU spokesman, Jean-Christophe Filori. </p> <p>Ankara, which has passed a flurry of pro-EU reforms under Mr Erdogan, hopes to secure a start date for European accession negotiations this December. </p> <p>Mr Verheugen's five-day visit is deemed crucial in ascertaining whether Ankara is ready to open membership talks. </p> <p>But EU diplomats based in the largely Muslim state said the attempt to crack down on adultery could strengthen the hand of countries opposed to Turkey joining the EU. </p> <p>Although, in the face of the public outcry, the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) has vowed to vote against it, the ruling Islamists control a comfortable majority in parliament. </p> <p>Women's groups and other activists have announced a mass protest outside the House on September 14, when legislators are expected to discuss the proposed changes to the body of law. However, Mr Erdogan said the proposed law would strengthen equality between the sexes because, unlike its earlier version, it would apply to both men and women. </p> <p>Violators will face the same three-year prison term. </p> <p>But critics, who include much of Turkey's western-oriented elite, contend the move will not only distance the country from European norms but align it to Islamic law-based states such as Saudi Arabia, where adulterers are stoned to death. </p> <p>Liz Amado, at the Women for Women's Human Rights group in Istanbul, said: \"No modern country has such a law. It will legitimise the state interfering in private lives, and it will be used against women.\"</p>",
  "Vladimir Putin's solemn weekend broadcast to the Russian people struck many popular chords and will have satisfied most of his compatriots, but it left unclear what concrete changes in policy will come in the wake of the catastrophe of Beslan. <p>The president appealed to nostalgic Soviet patriots and Russia's ancient sense of encirclement when he said the collapse of the USSR left the country \"without defences either to the east or west\". He criticised the mistakes of the security forces, saying: \"We could have been more effective if we had acted professionally and at the right moment.\" </p> <p>He conjured up a frightening external threat, indirectly accusing the US of supporting terrorists and trying to disarm Russia as a nuclear power and pull territory away from it. \"Some would like to cut a juicy piece of our pie. Others help them,\" he said. \"Terrorism is just one instrument they use.\" </p> <p>He called for unity as the best form of strength because in the past \"we showed ourselves to be weak and the weak get beaten\". </p> <p>Mr Putin signalled that he intends to re-establish control over security across Russia. But how can he do it? He faces enormous challenges in all areas of domestic, military and foreign policies. </p> <p><b> Domestic</b><br> </p> <p> In putting all the blame on international terrorism, the president avoided using the word \"Chechnya\" at all. The measures he talked about in broad terms - to strengthen Russia's unity, create a new system of control over the northern Caucasus and set up an effective anti-crisis management system - need to be fleshed out. </p> <p>The speech also left the suspicion that Mr Putin was exploiting the shock of Beslan to accelerate efforts to create a more authoritarian and centralised form of rule, and using the notion of a terrorist war on Russia to divert attention from rising social and economic tensions. </p> <p>All the indicators show an increase in the gap between rich and poor, as well as stubbornly high rates of joblessness, particularly in parts of the northern Caucasus. The high world price for oil has given the government a cushion at least to pay wages and pensions on time, unlike a few years ago, but Mr Putin's neo-liberal economic strategy caused the biggest street protests of his presidency this summer. </p> <p>Other shocks are in store, including a rise in the domestic price of oil and gas, which will hit people's utility bills. Medicine is being privatised, leaving thousands defenceless. The closure of kindergartens and even schools is hitting families hard in smaller towns, many in the northern Caucasus - precisely the areas where tension can turn to violence. </p> <p>In central Russia discontent often turns to apathy. In Muslim regions it can lead people to Islamism. The oddest line in the president's speech was his suggestion that Russians cannot \"live in as carefree a manner as before\" - as though his compatriots have not endured some of the harshest ordeals in Eu rope in the last century, including civil war, dictatorship, foreign invasion, and the recent collapse in living standards and security which he himself mentioned. </p> <p><b> Military</b><br> </p> <p> Mr Putin has few options militarily. The war in Chechnya is going badly, and Russian deaths continue at a rate of 15 a week. The resistance fighters are not as strong as they were during the first Chechen war but the struggle is essentially at a stalemate. </p> <p>The president has gradually been restoring the power of the KGB, now renamed the FSB. It was weakened under President Yeltsin, but Mr Putin recently put the border guards back under FSB control. Handling terrorism is in the hands of a dozen different ministries and he may create a Russian version of the US department of home land security, essentially a strengthened FSB. </p> <p>Other ideas which were already under discussion before the Beslan atrocity were to raise the profile of Russia's security council. Under Igor Ivanov it has little clout and the key discussions on security take place weekly in what is sometimes called \"the little Politburo\". It is chaired by Mr Putin and includes all the \"power\" ministers: defence, interior, foreign affairs, as well as the prosecutor general. </p> <p>Sergei Ivanov, the defence minister and a friend of the president, who is tipped as his successor, might be appointed to chair the security council. Other suggestions are that the job of vice-president be re-established. </p> <p>Mr Putin's call for strengthening the unity of the country might mean a further boost for the restoration of \"vertical\" rule. He has already changed parliament's upper house, the federation council, so that regional governors and legislative leaders no longer sit in it. Now there is talk of the president appointing governors, rather than them being elected. This would bring Russia back towards the Soviet system of hierarchical one-party rule from Moscow. </p> <p><b> Foreign policy</b><br> </p> <p> The president's emphasis on a powerful external threat will cut into his foreign policy options. In the Caucasus, Russia's bargaining position has weakened over the last year. The new nationalist government in Georgia is unlikely to help seal its frontier with Russia when it is trying to remove the Russian troops from the disputed territory of South Ossetia, which was within Georgia's borders in Soviet times. </p> <p>Azerbaijan may be unwilling to help clamp down on its Chechen diaspora while Russia has failed to get Armenian troops out of the large areas of Azerbaijan which they occupy. </p> <p>The US and Russia are struggling for influence in the southern Caucasus, and Mr Putin will not want any American interference in the northern Caucasus, including Chechnya, as well. His claim that Washington is exploiting the disruption caused by terrorism is a warning that, even though both sides claim to be allies against an invisible international enemy, the rules of the game have strict limits.</p>",
  "I'm off in a couple of weeks to Los Angeles - the city where I've spent most of the past 25 years. It's a place outsiders love to disrespect: La La Land, the Nowhere City, Tinseltown, Lost Angeles, where all the oddballs rolled to when America tilted west. <p>Songsters can be sentimental about New York (\"it's a wonderful town\"), London (\"a foggy day in, etc\") and Glasgow (\"belongs to me\"). But not LA. To accompany the 1984 Olympics, the games tsar, Peter Ueberroth, commissioned a city anthem. Sinatra's sugary LA is My Lady flopped. Clear winner was Randy Newman's acerbic I Love LA: \"Look at that mountain/ Look at those trees/ Look at that bum over there, man/ He's down on his knees.\" </p> <p>Traditionally, LA is good for sour jokes. \"Who,\" Woody Allen asked, \"would want to live in a city where the only cultural advantage is right on red\"? According to Tom Taussik, \"The difference between Los Angeles and yogurt is that yogurt has real culture.\" And, of course, there are those like Dorothy Parker who dispute there is anything there: LA is \"seventy-two suburbs in search of a city\". Urban blah. </p> <p>LA has always inspired wildly contrary reactions - \"city of light, city of night\", as The Doors described it in LA Woman, the track that will forever thunder out on the city's classic rock stations. Reyner Banham, the architectural and design historian, famously popularised it as freeway utopia, the ideal blend of \"the four ecologies\" - beach, mountain, desert and town. In the trilogy beginning with City of Quartz, a work which eerily forecast the Rodney King riots, social historian Mike Davis has hammered away at his vision of LA as an \"apocalypse theme park\", the quintessence of all that is corrupt and doomed in the US. </p> <p>Personally I tend to the Banham/City of Light view. But whoever is right, LA is changing. Partly it's the slow breakdown of the state's social services, following the 1970s taxpayers' revolt; mainly it's uncontrollable immigration. With the North American Free Trade Agreement the southwest has virtually an open border with Mexico. Already hispanics are the major block in the state's population. With Cruz Bustamante, who gave Schwarzenegger a good run, they almost had their first hispanic governor. It won't be long. </p> <p>Historically, Mexico is merely reclaiming what was once its sovereign territory. Hispanic irredentism may herald Davis's apocalypse. </p> <p>The LA jokes currently circulating on the web reflect hispanic-Anglo tension. Flavour of the season are mock tests, such as the spoof Los Angeles High School Math Proficiency Exam which opens by requesting the information: \"Name/Gang/Make of Gun\" and has questions such as: \"Raoul is serving six years for murder. He made $10,000 for the hit. If his common-law wife is spending $100 per month, how much money will be left when he gets out of prison? How many years will he get for killing that bitch for spending his money?\" </p> <p>Less xenophobic, but still nastyish, is the spoof Greater Los Angeles Area Driver's License Application. It requests: (1) Name Stage name/Attorney. (2) Sex - a) Male; b) Female; c) Formerly Male; d) Formerly Female. If female, indicate breast implant size. Will the size of your implants hinder your ability to safely operate a motor vehicle in any way?\" </p> <p>The first multiple-choice question on the \"test\" is: \"If you are the victim of a car jacking, you should immediately: a) Call the police to report the crime; b) Call Channel 4 News to report the crime, then watch your car on the news on a high-speed chase; c) Call your attorney and discuss a lawsuit against cellular phone company for 911 call not going through; d) Call your therapist; e) None of the above (South Central residents only).\" </p> <p>Funny, but not exactly funny ha ha. Not much is Ha Ha in La La Land any more, it seems.</p>",
  "Labour's seven years of vacillating over a ban on foxhunting will finally end this week when the government announces on Thursday that the Parliament Act will be used to force the measure on to the statute book by mid-October. <p>A debate is however continuing on how quickly the ban will be brought into force, with the possibility that hunts will be given as long as two years to wind down and ensure staff and dogs are found alternative employment. Delay would also prevent scenes of civil disobedience before a general election, expected next spring. </p> <p>The bill, mirroring a previous attempt stymied by the Lords last year, will go through the Commons, probably on September 15, the day after Tony Blair speaks to the TUC conference. Peers will have up to 30 days to discuss the bill before the prime minister asks the Speaker, Michael Martin, to invoke the Parliament Act to enforce it in the face of continuing opposition in the Lords. </p> <p>The Parliament Act can be invoked when the Commons, in successive sessions, passes the same legislation. </p> <p>Ministers regard the bill's passage as essential to steadying the party mood and showing Labour can be trusted to fulfil manifesto commitments. One leftwing MP, Alan Simpson, said: \"I want a bloody vote and I am fed up with being run round ... on this issue.\" </p> <p>But Lord Strathclyde, the Conservative leader in the Lords, warned that the bill's reintroduction would require at least six days' scrutiny spread over a number of weeks. He implied that some of the eight bills still to complete scrutiny in the Lords would have to be jeopardised. </p> <p>Important bills in the Lords include the children bill, setting up a children's commissioner, the pensions bill, protecting employees who lose their pension when their company collapses, and the constitution reform bill, setting up a supreme court, a new system of judicial appointments and possibly abolishing the title of lord chancellor. </p> <p>A government source said: \"If the Tories are going to try to wreck legislation protecting pensioners and children simply for the sake of keeping the sport of hunting, well, as they say in America, 'bring it on'.\"</p>",
  "Tony Blair should be kept in the background during the referendum campaign on the European constitution because he risks turning off key swing voters. <p>New research conducted by Mori for the Foreign Policy Centre suggests that a third-term Labour government would lose the referendum if it turned into a plebiscite on Mr Blair or his record. </p> <p>Chris Patten, the former EU commissioner and Tory cabinet minister, should head the campaign and decide its strategy, the Labour-leaning centre recommends. His chief support from front rank politicians should be confined to Gordon Brown, the mildly sceptic chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, the former Tory chancellor and Charles Kennedy, the Lib Dem leader. Efforts should also be made to enlist Michael Portillo, the former Tory cabinet minister and sceptic.</p> <p>The analysis is seen as the most systematic attempt so far to map out the battleground of a referendum that the government looks unable to avoid in 2006.</p> <p>The research shows that 65% are undecided, outnumbering firm Yes and No voters and contrasting with suggestions that the No campaign has an unassailable lead. Most people are still persuadable, with only 35% having strong views one way or the other that cannot be changed.</p>",
  "<p>This has not been the sunniest of summers for Sky Sports or its managing director Vic Wakeling. The force that changed the face of televised sport with live, exclusive and imaginative coverage was sidelined during Euro 2004, as the BBC and ITV had their day. Then the Olympics wooed away a quarter of sports-mad viewers when it coincided with the return of Premiership football - Sky's biggest draw. But Wakeling, 60, a personable Geordie, is irrepressible. He is focused on \"Super September\", Sky Sports' busiest month ever, as his superior \u00a3720m-plus annual budget, \u00a3430m more than the BBC's, delivers. </p> <p>There are six big events - the Ryder Cup, World Cup football qualifying matches, the Premiership, ICC Champions Trophy cricket, the Uefa Champions League, and the US Open tennis tournament. Four come with red button interactive choice options. A total of 130 outside broadcast events have to be organised in September - the monthly average is 100 - each manned by about 60 people. On September 29 Sky covers its 3,000th live Premiership match. This is sport on a grand scale. </p> <p>It is masterminded from Wakeling's unpretentious middling-sized corner office, rarely visited by journalists, and a permanent full-time staff of 350 that doubles at the weekends. He dispenses polystyrene cups of very strong tea. Three packs of cigarettes sit on his desk. Sets of business papers, sport by sport, line the window sills. </p> <p>Wakeling works from 7.30am to 7pm every day. Peter Salmon, the BBC's director of sport, says he's \"the governor\". During this interview of almost two hours, Wakeling, a lively talker, made sure he was always facing the ten screens which line one wall, his five sports channels, Sky News, and four big screens with live coverage. </p> <p>Wakeling is not flummoxed, as is the City, by James Murdoch's new marketing emphasis on Sky's broad appeal, something for everyone, which seems to downgrade his speciality, Premiership football. He became head of Sky Sport in January 1993 after being appointed by the awesome Sam Chisholm. \"He said: 'I don't think you're good enough but no-one else is around, I'll give you a shot at it'.\" Last month Wakeling signed a new four-year contract offered by Murdoch, the fifth chief executive he has reported to. This will span the next negotiations with the Premier League. What makes this wealthy man work? Obvious really - sport is his life. \"I am still having fun,\" he says. </p> <p>In June Wakeling told me that the Olympics would disappoint. Now he says: \"I think the Olympics surpassed everyone's expectations, they were absolutely marvellous. I eat my hat.\" Would he have done things differently? \"I'm not going to join in that one, when you are doing something on the scale of the Olympics. I think you can nit pick. Overall they came across well.\" </p> <p>Sky Sports has no chance of showing the 2012 Olympics, even if London is the host city, because the rights have already been sold to terrestrial television. Not covering the Olympics is one of Wakeling's big regrets. He did not attend in the 1980s, when he worked for ITV, although he did visit the Sydney games. \"It is very, very encouraging for us to see the type of [audience] figures the BBC got. It shows us there are more sports fans out there, for the right sort of events. Part of the problem with Sky is that although we cover a number of sports, we're perceived as the football channel. Football is very important to us but look at the depth of our cricket coverage, every English overseas tour since 1990. We do more tennis than anyone else. We've the Golden League athletics on this month, where the stars we've been seeing [at the Olympics] are on week in week out. The challenge is in marketing and promoting ourselves to tell more people about the depth of sport.\" </p> <p>The Olympics has prompted a rethink at Sky Sports. \"No doubt about it, there are new sports we will move into over the next six to nine months. We're negotiating at the moment, on a couple of fronts. One of them has more female interest, another is a blokey sport. You have got to widen the audience. </p> <p>\"Sailing is one of the things we are looking at. The things you can do with cameras, data, with virtual action, is absolutely amazing. We are also looking at equestrianism.\" </p> <p>In his smoker's voice - he's a 40-a-day-man - Wakeling then gives a master class in the Sky Sports approach. \"Can we make that [sport] attractive to the viewers at home? A lot of it is about personalities. Right from the outset we demanded our directors get closer with their shots. Before Sky came along, close might have been from the knees up. Now we're tight in on them, right in on the guy's face ... you see the sweat dripping. It's about making people who don't support those teams care about who wins or loses. You're not going to watch an event if you don't care. There aren't enough Arsenal matches around.\" </p> <p>Then it's being open to innovation. \"At the moment there are no plans to launch any more sports channels but if someone walks in with a good idea tomorrow those plans will change. That's the way it's always been here, you don't say no to anything.\" </p> <p>\"Again,\" he sighs, \"how do we get this message across? This is the secret for going forward. We've got to tell people that there's something for everyone.\" He is even considering making documentaries - Amir Khan as a subject springs to mind. \"The sports keep changing as well. When we started, rugby union was an amateur sport, rugby league a winter sport, cricket was always played in daytime, now it's played under floodlights. However television might change over the next five years, ten years, people will want to watch more live sport. The interest is huge. We know that the Barb figures are nowhere near the true figure. People watch in pubs, in market squares, We add on 50% for big matches. </p> <p>So what about pay-per-view? \"We're a subscription-based business. People on the fringes of sport, people like Don King the boxing promoter, were shouting pay-per-view is the future. We weren't sure. It's our priority to put the best up there for our subscribers, that's our main business.\" Under the current deal with the Premier League, Sky has sold 425,000 season tickets at \u00a350 each, allowing viewers to watch 50 Premiership matches. In October Sky will screen its first darts pay-per-view match, featuring the British champions Andy Fordham and Phil Taylor. \"It's a one-off experiment, and we're always looking to experiment.\" </p> <p>He adds: \"Football has been a significant driver since 1992, and it will continue to be because our football will keep changing. You look at what we are doing this season. We've got Football First, 55 minutes, nearly live, of every Premiership game played on Saturdays, in competition with Match of the Day.\" </p> <p>Wakeling insists on ten cameras per match. \"The show was in the Premier League tender document. I admit when I read it, I missed it, because of course I just went to everything that went live, all four packages. We went back to it and thought, that's a good opportunity, Not sure it is quite how they [the clubs] envisaged it would work, but with our technology it's what fans of some of these clubs want. At some stage, towards the end of this football season, we'll say, what do we do next, because in this business you must never relax. You make one thing work and then you're thinking of the next idea. If you are ever tempted to stand still then someone more adventurous will steal up on you and take the lead.\" </p> <p>This has resulted in alluring female sports presenters, the playercam, the hilarious Fan Zone commentary, the clean feed without commentary, the option of the American commentary for the Ryder Cup. Wakeling's next big push is high-definition sharp pictures, as seen in America. \"It is absolutely marvellous. Our priority will be to do all Premiership football in high def, and re-equip all our outside broadcast trucks to cope. </p> <p>\"Next August we will be ready to go. Whether Sky is ready to go is a question for James, but my job is to be ready to go, and we will be. Our quality of pictures at the moment is very, very good, but it makes it that bit better, especially for the pub market. I don't know anyone who can map out the long-term future of sports coverage. If they do they are probably bullshitting. Ten years ago very few people had heard of digital, DVDs, games, the internet. You couldn't have envisaged what we are doing now.\" </p> <p>Does he ever feel guilty about creating the Footballers' Wives culture of incredibly rich overpaid footballers - the Wayne Rooney \u00a327m phenomenon? \"No, because I think the footballers are paid what the market can afford. I think it was happening around the world before Sky came along. The fact is we have some of the best playing here. There's a huge fascination with sport. Television is probably one of the great promotions sport gets, if sport looks good on television more and more people will go and watch it.\". </p> <p>But does Murdoch, his youthful boss, understand British sport in the visceral way Tony Ball did? \"He understands sport,\" says Wakeling. \"Look at his background at Star TV in Singapore, and the battles they have over there over the value of cricket and indeed Premiership football rights.\" </p> <p>But has BSkyB been too smart in retaining exclusive rights in the face of European Commission opposition? \"They've been on our case for the last ten years. I don't know what's going to happen in the future. People ask what's going to happen next time round and I say, guys, give us a break. we're at the start of a three-year contract. In 12 months' time the Premiership will have to think about it. They, I assume, will issue their new invitation to tender. For the moment let's just watch football. I don't know what is going to happen in three years' time and I don't think anyone does. What is frustrating is the fact that in the Premiership you have one of the most successful sporting models in the world,\" </p> <p>Why attack something that works? \"Exclusivity is very important in what we do, but yes, I can envisage something else. I think we have such a broad base. In the years ahead, we have to widen the base, make sure we are strong in other areas. Even if the Premiership came to us and said, 'by the way it's exactly the same exclusive rights on offer', who's to say we will win them again? Anyone can start a channel. Somebody might be plotting over the next three years. You don't take anything for granted.\" </p> <p>There is something very engaging, down to earth and direct about Wakeling. If he'd stayed in newspapers he'd probably be a tabloid editor. </p> <p>\"I never planned to come into television. When I started in newspapers in the north-east I wanted to come to Fleet Street, and I once did some down-table freelance subbing at the Sun and the Express when Kelvin MacKenzie, a mate, was running the backbench. </p> <p>\"I have never planned a single career move, it just happened to me. I joined the Blaydon Courier, a weekly paper, straight from school. I was delivering papers one Friday morning on my paper round and reading the local weekly. They were advertising for a junior reporter, so I finished the round off very quickly and got on my bike and rode six miles down the road and was waiting on the doorstep when the editor arrived. He gave me the job there and then.\" </p> <p>Television? \"It's been great. I always say, for all the quantity of sports never lose sight of the quality.\" </p> <p><strong>How Sky Sports got a piece of the action</strong></p> <p><strong> 1991 </strong></p> <p>April: Sky Sports is launched as one of five BSkyB channels.

  "<p>A career in the law is a hotly pursued ambition for many. Most never regret choosing the legal path but an increasing number feel trapped by the nature of their qualifications. \"I wanted to be a journalist, but went into the law instead because it was so much more secure, and because there was a clearly defined way of going about it, which made life easier,\" says solicitor Sarah. \"I chickened out, really.\" </p> <p>The good news for Sarah - and any other solicitors and barristers frustrated by the professional life their early choices marked out for them - is that a legal qualification can actually help you to get a foot in far more creative doors than you might expect. It is, after all, an excellent way of marking you out from the (largely English 'n' arts) crowd that generally apply for media and publishing jobs. </p> <p>\"The discipline of a law degree, the way it teaches you to read through complex things and assimilate information quickly, makes it very attractive to any employer,\" says Margaret at media recruitment consultancy Judy Fisher Associates. \"Everything is becoming much more litigious and television, theatrical, film and publicity people all need individuals who are aware of legal implications and avoid potential problems and pitfalls.\" </p> <p>It worked for Gillian Smith, who has a degree in law with German law but decided against looking for a training contract. \"I didn't like the look of the working ethic at the majority of City law firms and the lifestyle that came with it,\" she says. </p> <p>So after temping at literary agencies, a press office for a TV company and for an advertising regulator, she found a permanent job as a secretary in the BBC's legal and business affairs department. \"My familiarity with legal terminology and a capability for reading and understanding legal documents meant I could develop the role from a PA job to more of a para-legal role and take on my own drafting responsibilities.\" </p> <p>Ten months later she was promoted to her current position as a music rights executive for the BBC and she hopes to use that as a springboard into a job still closer to the creative heart of the corporation. \"It's about using your law degree to open up opportunities which would perhaps be otherwise unavailable to you.\" </p> <p>Margaret recommends the circuitous route available to holders of legal qualifications. \"It's much easier to get into business affairs, compliance or rights departments of media companies than to get straight into production. Then you can progress from within the organisation. It's a matter of getting where you want to get via a bit of a sneaky route!\" </p> <p>Sarah, too, has made the leap out of law. Three days after qualifying into her firm's commercial litigation department, she resigned and started unpaid work experience at two national newspapers. She has been working as a freelance journalist ever since. \"I think they were impressed by the fact that I had stuck it out long enough to qualify but then given up the security - and money! - of being a solicitor in order to do, at last, what I'd always wanted to do,\" she says. \"So the people I met were that bit more willing to give me a chance to try and prove myself. And then the research skills and the ability to write fast and clearly that you develop in practice and dealing with clients really stand you in good stead when you're writing to deadline or interviewing people for articles.\" </p> <p>Margaret does sound a note of caution. \"There are right ways and wrong ways of using your law degree to propel you into a media career. If you take a job in legal publishing, for example, rather than in the rights department in a general publishing company, you make it harder to escape being perceived as anything other than 'a legal bod'.\" </p> <p>And if you're not yet sure which of the legal and media worlds is the more tempting, you could see how both work. \"Some major companies - including the BBC - offer in-house training contracts, so it's worth looking up those you are interested in and seeing what legal-related jobs are offered,\" says Gillian. </p> <p>Above all, remember that the law doesn't have to be an ass - these days, it can be a positive asset. Why not use it?</p>",
  "<p>This has been the summer of the sickie as employers announced tighter management of sick leave. York council became the first public authority to adopt an absence management scheme. </p> <p>Consultancies in this field, well established in the private sector, have had their eyes on the public sector for some time. It is well known that the whole public sector has always had much higher rates of absenteeism than private business. </p> <p>Absence is monitored to differentiate those employees who take the odd duvet day from those who can't face Mondays due to more serious condition, such as chronic depression. Nurses are then introduced as independent counsellors. </p> <p>It is argued that, among other things, high absenteeism is bad for employee health, and that many of the genuine stress-related illnesses found in the public sector have their roots in an anarchic sickie culture which leaves those in the office struggling to cover for those who aren't. </p> <p>This is a difficult case to make because employees, even more than employers, seem readier to believe that colleagues are constantly trying to take advantage of their bosses, rather than accept that bad working environments make people ill. </p> <p>But the fact remains that workplaces where employees have control over their environments have lower absenteeism rates, and that the ultimate responsibility for the environment rests with the employer. </p> <p>Pauline Crawford, a sociologist with her own consultancy, Corporate Heart, warns that many employers recklessly overestimate the emotional well-being of their employees, to the point where they risk legal action. </p> <p>The connection to a bad atmosphere and bad health may seem nebulous now, but until recently, so did the connection between office furniture and tenosynovitis - inflammation of the tendons. However the courts now recognise repetitive strain injury as a real illness, as many employers (mostly in the public sector) have found to their cost.</p>",
  "<p>Graphic designer Anna Richards resigned from her last job because of the smell. \"It was a very young, trendy office and it was also quite small, so when you walked in in the morning you'd be hit by this cocktail of chemical smells - perfume, deodorant, shampoo, aftershave,\" she says. \"Then somebody would start leafing through a magazine with a free perfume sampler, just to add to the cloud. I'd have a headache by 10am. On bad days my eyes would itch and I'd feel sick for hours on end.\" </p> <p>She quit because there was nothing else she felt she could do. \"You can't stop people wearing deodorant if they want to, and how unpopular would you be in your office if you tried? It's my problem, and it was up to me to deal with it.\" </p> <p>But that might not be the case for too much longer. Increasingly, chemicals in cosmetics, fragrances and cleaners are being blamed for a range of common office maladies, from headaches and dizziness to lethargy and loss of concentration. Many experts believe that fragrance-sensitivity could become as big and divisive an issue in offices as smoking was in the '80s and '90s. </p> <p>In fact, many doctors now believe that what many of us put down as normal symptoms of office life - headaches, sluggishness, lethargy and nausea - could be symptoms of Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (MCS) syndrome, a catch-all term that includes the sensitivity to manufactured fragrances. MCS has also been linked to dizziness, depression and hypertension. In offices where people are packed together and air conditioning takes the place of an open window, it is the chemicals in perfumes, deodorants, hairsprays and other personal products that are often most to blame. </p> <p>If fragrance-sensitivity sounds like a very modern syndrome, it's because the situation has got manifestly worse in the past few decades. According to Betty Page, who runs the Fragranced Product Information Network, there are more sufferers because there is more fragrance: \"Historically, fragrance has been for luxury and special occasion use,\" she says. \"Since the 1970s, fragrance has become a part of daily life. The use of fragrance has increased 10-fold since the 1950s. The fragrance industry doubled in size during the 1980s.\" </p> <p>But research into the effects of the cocktail of chemicals that go into every sweet-smelling scent has not kept up. The Women's Environmental Network (WEN) points out that, of the 30,000 chemicals currently on the market, only 10% have sufficient safety data and none has been tested for long-term repeated and cumulative effects. </p> <p>WEN's Helen Lynn says that office workers can face especially high levels of exposure: \"Air conditioning may well exacerbate the problem with fragranced air - whether from air fresheners or colleagues' perfumes - re-circulating round the building. It's similar, I suppose, to everyone getting the same cold when all the germs re-circulate round a well-sealed office. WEN has had a fragrance-free office policy for the last year and staff have reported health benefits in terms of absence of headaches, streaming eyes and a tightness of the chest, as well as a clearer head.\" </p> <p>In America, the fragrance-free office is moving into the mainstream, as fragrance-sensitive employees start to assert their rights. In the past three years, a growing number have claimed protection under the Americans With Disabilities Act, which governs employment-related civil rights. Under the act some fragrance-sensitive workers have forced their employers to provide \"job-related reasonable accommodations.\" </p> <p>The exact nature of those \"accommodations\" is still at the discretion of companies, but can include a completely fragrance-free environment. The Canadian city of Halifax has become the first major centre in North America to prohibit the wearing of all cosmetic fragrances - from Giorgio Armani to grandma's lavender soap - in most indoor public places, including municipal offices, libraries, hospitals, courts, classrooms, and buses. Others, like Santa Cruz in the US, have implemented partial fragrance-free policies. </p> <p>Less drastic measures that many American companies have instigated include fragrance-free toilets, where the afflicted can get temporary respite, and a ban on those fragrances the company can easily control, such as perfumed cleaning products and bathroom potpourri. The Job Accommodation Network, a group funded by the US Department of Labour, lists ways in which companies can and have responded to the increasingly vociferous calls for action from fragrance-sensitive staff. </p> <p>In Europe, however, only Germany has a national strategy to fight the effects of wider MCS. European legislation expected in early 2005 is likely to tighten regulation of the chemical industry, restrict the use of some chemicals, and improve product labelling. At the moment, a cosmetic product need only list \"parfum\" as an ingredient, a term that can hide up to 100 different chemicals. But office workers who suspect that fragrance-sensitivity may be the cause of their daily headaches have little recourse. According to experts on employment law, proving that a particular product or chemical is responsible for a list of non-specific symptoms is almost impossible. </p> <p>Nevertheless, many experts believe that, as more employees link their symptoms to chemical sensitivity, companies will be forced to implement some anti-fragrance policies or risk losing valuable members of staff. And there could be other economic considerations that force employers to take the issue seriously. \"I'm sure that many employees suffer from the effects of perfumes and fragrances but haven't made the link yet,\" says Gloria Miqueles of WEN. \"Companies should certainly encourage workers to avoid wearing them at the office because it would save them money, with reduced absenteeism due to ill-health, and also because people breathing fragrance- and chemical-free air work better.\"</p>",
  "<p>A certain species of ant and the honeybee are said to be big practitioners of nepotism, or the favouring of kith and kin for food, jobs, shelter and other life necessities. But among humans, the experts say, nepotism is so last year. </p> <p>\"It's less acceptable than it ever has been,\" says John Drummond, chief executive of consultancy Integrity Works. </p> <p>\"It's gradually being wiped out,\" concurs Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University management school. \"It's always happened in family-run concerns, and it continues to happen in them, and somehow that doesn't upset the applecart because people expect it. But we've become much more politically correct, and the law is what is dictating this, just so there is justice in the employment of people in the workplace.\" </p> <p>Out there on the corporate ant-hill, however, a few know better. </p> <p> Perhaps the most insidious version of nepotism is what Cooper calls indirect nepotism - as in getting someone else to do the dirty work of the actual hiring instead of announcing, \"I am hiring my son/ daughter/ toy boy/ concubine for this fast-track, high-level position.\" </p> <p>Tim, a former broadcast journalist who has gone into the slightly less corrupt world of PR, remembers that family members of big guns with recognisable surnames always had a leg up in securing jobs with a major UK broadcasting operation. \"They'd get 5,000 applications for a job, and people who had a recognisable name would always get calls to interview. They'd interview maybe as few as five people for a job, and the ones with a parent or other relative there would always get a shot.\" </p> <p>A standout surname definitely helped, Tim adds, \"when it was something like Cholmondeley-Warner. If you're a Smith, it would be much more difficult.\" What also helped was that sought-after summer job experience arranged by daddy or mummy. </p> <p>\"It was never blatant,\" Tim says. \"But back routes - that's the way it really works.\" </p> <p> American author Adam Bellow - son of author Saul Bellow - would agree. In his book In Praise of Nepotism, Bellow Jr argues that nepotism is on the upswing in that alleged meritocracy, the US. He also believes it's not a bad thing, as long as junior can cut the mustard. </p> <p>Underestimate the pressures of nepotism at your peril, however. That's what happened in the case of Philip, a marketing director who had quietly given his six months' notice. Philip learned - before his boss did - that his would-be successor's claim to his job was based solely on secretarial experience, her swimming instructor's certification and a hearty recommendation from her former boss. </p> <p>\"My boss told me that she had found the perfect replacement for me - a woman who had a master's degree in marketing and had all kinds of experience,\" Philip says now. \"She was moving here from Asia with her husband, whose company had promoted him to a new job. I said 'great'. I didn't ask how this woman had surfaced on my boss's radar.\" </p> <p> He found out by accident. While his boss was on holiday, Philip found a woman waiting for him outside his office. His assistant told him in hushed tones that the woman, Patricia, was his replacement. Surprised, he invited Patricia, who looked in her early 20s, into his office. \"My old boss knows your boss,\" she blurted out. \"I'm going to take your job when you leave.\" </p> <p>Still nonplussed, Philip congratulated her, and said he would love to see her CV. She didn't have it with her, she said, and made a quick exit. A puzzled Philip called on the HR director, who also knew of the plan to hire Patricia, but had not seen her CV either. </p> <p>When the CV did land in HR, Philip and the HR director were in for a shock when they saw her credentials, or lack thereof. When Philip went to his boss to alert her to the apparent misunderstanding, however, she initially didn't believe him. In fact, she threatened to fire him for being uncooperative before his notice period was up. </p> <p>Only when the HR director showed her proof positive did the boss cool down. The matter was never mentioned to Philip again. Patricia never reappeared. Philip is still not sure why his boss was so willing to go on her friend's recommendation without ever glancing at a CV. </p> <p>Perhaps we need to think of nepotism as a vice like smoking - admittedly bad for everyone's health, but with a frisson of glamour that is never totally out of style.</p>",
  "<p>Who invented the digital camera? Find that man and give him a medal. And while you're doing it, make sure you jab him with the pin really, really hard, and stamp on his foot a few times while you're about it. They're everywhere! </p> <p>I remember the happy days when your camera was buried in a drawer next to the aftersun ready to be dug out for the annual trip to Bournemouth. These days every second person is flashing their camera around at every opportunity, and it's too damn easy to take pictures. At least when you were worrying about using up your film, you were vaguely discerning about the subjects you shoot. Now every moment is considered worthy of photographic preservation. </p> <p>I have been captured on colleagues' new cameras doing the following noteworthy activities: filling the photocopier; replacing the ink cartridge in the printer; making tea; drinking tea; drinking some more tea; staring with ill-disguised hatred at the camera and the person wielding it. While drinking tea. Every computer in my office is now groaning under the digital weight of uploaded pictures just waiting to be used as a screensaver, emailed to friends incredulous that anyone who knows them could believe that they would want this pap filling their inboxes, or just forgotten forever until the IT guy points out the reason none of our systems work is that every spare byte of capacity is taken up with photos of Sara's yoga retreat. </p> <p>Of course, it's worst at this time of year, when everybody thinks I've spent all summer long just waiting to see their holiday photos. I have been reduced to darting about the office, feigning deafness, so I don't have to respond to the invitations to crouch over someone's computer, staring slack-jawed at 47 pictures of the same bit of Tenerife beach. </p> <p>I was too slow for Mark, though. \"Come here and look at this,\" he cried. \"It's really cool!\" Obviously, the law of cool dictates that anything described as cool could never be, so I should have made a run for it. Alas, I was too slow. And what fresh hell was this? I watched in horror as Mark clicked his mouse on to the slideshow function. An endless stream of pictures of Corfu melded into one another, soundtracked by - and I swear I'm not making this up - the theme from Zorba the Greek. </p> <p>Strangely, no one with a camera was around at that precise moment. A shame, too - I'm sure the expression on my face would have been a picture.</p>",
  "<p>Public anger and frustration with smokers is revealed today in a poll suggesting Britons want far tougher laws on selling cigarettes to children, higher taxes on tobacco and even sanctions against parents who let their offspring smoke. </p> <p>Four-fifths of those questioned for BBC News want the minimum age of customers to whom retailers can sell tobacco to be raised from 16 to 18; a smaller majority, 55%, think it should be 21. </p> <p>More than 90% of people surveyed also said there should be tougher penalties against shopkeepers who break the law, which is already patchily enforced although breaches lead to \u00a32,500 fines. </p> <p>The appetite for a significantly more aggressive stance against smoking is demonstrated as the government prepares to publish its white paper on public health. The BBC poll, conducted by ICM, also shows some support for moves the government has made quite clear are non-starters - making tobacco illegal and forcing smokers and obese people to pay for their treatment. A small majority want higher taxes on tobacco. </p> <p>Increasing the age at which children can be sold cigarettes to 18 would bring it into line with alcohol sales, but the suggestion was greeted sceptically by anti-smoking group ASH. \"It is not really a priority for us,\" said a spokesman. \"Everything we know about teenagers suggests they are very good at getting round restrictions of this kind. It would be very difficult to enforce. We know if we can stop adults smoking and discourage the view it is an adult activity, that would be the most effective way of stopping teenagers smoking.\" </p> <p>Forest, the pressure group which defends the interests of adults who smoke, said it would \"support any reasonable measure\" that made it more difficult for under-18s to buy tobacco. </p> <p>Director Simon Clarke added that the suggestion of raising the age limit to 21 \"shows how hysterical the smoking debate has become\". </p> <p>Although nearly two-thirds (64%) of those questioned think whether or not people smoke is ultimately their own decision, nearly half of all smokers in the poll agreed the government should try to make people change their behaviour. </p> <p>The poll does however muddy the water over the contentious issue of introducing smoking bans in the workplace, including pubs and clubs. When asked if they favoured a ban, more than two-thirds agreed, although there was marked polarisation, with 22% strongly opposed to the idea and 52% strongly in favour. </p> <p>In a separate multiple choice question, the greatest number (44%) prefer smokers to be given designated areas rather than an outright ban (32%). The government, which originally endorsed the industry's self-policing code to increase the number of non-smoking areas, has become frustrated at the slow progress over six years, only 46% of pubs had them at the end of last year. </p> <p>It has repeatedly told pubs and restaurants to do more, and a few pub chains have banned smoking in some outlets. Tony Blair has confirmed that the government is considering following Ireland, and possibly even Scotland, by implementing a legal ban in England. But ministers have made clear this should be a last resort and hinted that such a measure would be left to individual local authorities. </p> <p>The BBC poll also shows a majority of the public in favour of tougher rules governing the nutritional content of processed foods and stricter standards of health, diet and fitness in schools. There is a backlash against the sexualisation of children through sexual images on television and in magazines and many people of all generations reveal a distaste for casual sex in general. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The nationwide phone poll of 1,010 adults was conducted by ICM between August 20 and August 22.

  "<p>Watching England's abject performance in the last 20 minutes of their World Cup qualifying match against Austria, it was hard not to conclude that any number of watching Clives might have done a better job orchestrating matters from the England bench than Sven-Goran Eriksson. </p> <p>The national team, which we have been led to believe will peak at the 2006 World Cup, disintegrated into an unprofessional rabble playing with all the discipline and cohesion of a Sunday morning pub team. Clive Anderson might have communicated better to find out there was nothing wrong with Steven Gerrard when the Liverpool midfielder signalled Wayne Bridge was injured, only to find his gestures being wrongly interpreted by Eriksson and himself laughably being substituted by Jamie Carragher, a man utterly ill-suited to filling the Gerrard role in England's midfield. </p> <p>Or how about Clive Dunn? Having first found the Austrians don't like it up 'em with Blighty two goals to the good, even he might have seen the need for old-fashioned defensive bayonet action instead of the sloppy, gung-ho attack-at-all-costs style that may cost England dearly in their qualifying group. </p> <p>And then, of course, there is Sir Clive Woodward, who spoke last week of his desire to get into football coaching and management, all the way up to England level. On the face of it, the good knight would seem to be in a self-delusional cuckoo land inhabited by those who either are propelled by an out-of-control ego or swill down a little too much booze at the bar. But, as England continued to underachieve for the umpteenth time before Eriksson resorted to those irritating \"That's football\" platitudes that are becoming his hallmark, the feeling was growing that the nation's erstwhile top rugby coach could do no worse. </p> <p>It would have been interesting to hear what Woodward might have made of David James, whose blunder led to the equaliser. Would Sir Clive, with his dossiers on all aspects of players and opponents not to mention his attention to all manner of coaching minutiae, actually have had Manchester City's gaffe-prone goalkeeper anywhere near the England team in the first place? </p> <p>And would he not have the guts to grasp the Emperor's New Clothes issue of David Beckham? Captain Marvel he may once have been, but not any longer. When was the last time Beckham had a major influence on a meaningful international match? And is the man booked for a petulant second-half foul and who ran around like a headless chicken in those key closing minutes in Vienna actually the right man to be captaining the team? Sir Clive had Martin Johnson on whom he could rely, a figure of towering strength who rarely failed to deliver on the international stage. Increasingly, Beckham is looking like a show pony whose tricks no longer impress at the highest level. </p> <p>Surely Woodward, and indeed many other coaches, would conclude the time is right to give the leadership role to one who leads by example on the pitch. There are two obvious contenders, Gerrard or Gary Neville, and a man such as Woodward, who thought nothing of lobbing Neil Back out of his World Cup-winning team almost as soon as he arrived back in England, would certainly see Beckham is becoming an ever more ineffectual talisman. </p> <p>Sir Clive, in all probability, did not mean next week when he spoke about football and the England job. But defeat in Poland on Wednesday night, a possibility that seems by no means as improbable as a man walking out on the best job in rugby, would leave Eriksson on the thinnest of ice. The Swede's detractors within the FA are merely waiting for the moment to make their move, and Freddy Shepherd's shabby treatment of Sir Bobby Robson at Newcastle United means a ready-made caretaker is ready to take over at the helm while Woodward goes through tiresome formalities like acquiring a Uefa coaching badge and trying to gain credibility in the game he professes to love more than rugby (that must have raised a few eyebrows among the Twickenham faithful). Then Sir Clive can ease his way into the manager's chair. </p> <p>Woodward is a clever man. He has looked at what he perceives to be a lack of support for his methods in the RFU and walked. England's rugby results have been sliding, and there must be a serious doubt over whether or not England can regain their place as the dominant nation in the northern hemisphere, let alone the world, in the years leading to the next World Cup. </p> <p>Deep down, despite all his attacks on Old Fartdom and its inability or unwillingness to seize proper control of the professional game, I suspect Woodward has simply concluded that it is better to get out at the top instead of being shafted at a later date. And he is also shrewd enough to know his next move should be to find a leaky, underperforming unit, where any input he might make will be seen to be inspirational. </p> <p>Already, moves have been made behind the scenes to determine whether he might be interested in taking over the reins as performance director for UK Athletics to replace the retiring Max Jones, and the word is that athletics is another sport he might fancy. Exactly what the rival applicants, Charles van Commenee, Keith Connor and Daley Thompson, might make of that is uncertain. But one thing about Woodward, whether he winds up at Soho Square, Southampton or an Olympic stadium, is that he has total self-belief and knows precisely what is needed to be a winner. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The crowds that thronged the streets of Bolton on Saturday to catch a glimpse of Britain's 17-year-old boxing sensation Amir Khan cheered as he told them what they wanted to hear: that he would stay amateur until the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing and bring back a gold medal for Great Britain to add to the silver he won in Athens. </p> <p>He says he wants to do it for his country and that, for now, the professional side of the sport can wait. This is all very laudable, and UK Sport is belatedly waking up to the fact that the youngster should be a recipient of elite lottery funding, which falls a little short of \u00a330,000 a year. Also, Adidas are sniffing around seeing how they might offer their support without breaching boxing's strict amateur code. But Amir should think long and hard about how he might make the most out of his remarkable rise to fame.</p> <p>Almost eight million viewers watched Khan's Olympic final on BBC1, where he lost narrowly to the outstanding Cuban Mario Kindel\u00e1n, with a million or more listening to the fight in radio commentary. By any definition, Khan is hot news. But medals do not pay bills, buy houses and provide for your family and Khan would do well to realise four years is a long time in the boxing world.</p> <p>There have been those who always rejected the overtures of the professional world. The Cuban heavyweight Te\u00f3filo Stevenson, who won three Olympic gold medals, turned down a fortune to turn pro and fight Muhammad Ali saying: \"Professional boxing treats a fighter like a commodity to be bought and sold and discarded when he is no longer of use. I wouldn't exchange my piece of Cuba for all the money they could give me.\"</p> <p>But Khan is a little different, not least because he is unencumbered by the constraints of Castro's communism. A wrong assumption seems to be gaining currency whereby Khan will automatically gain world No1 status with Kindel\u00e1n's anticipated retirement and reign supreme until 2008. But suppose that another brilliant fighter comes out of Cuba to ruin the plans. Then Khan's marketability and earning capacity is damaged.</p> <p>The Amateur Boxing Association might not like to hear it, but my advice would be for Amir to sign as a pro and strike while the opportunity is there. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> It is hard to believe any cricketer has ever hit the ball with greater ferocity than Andrew Flintoff. Once upon a time, \"getting Freddied\" involved consuming gallons of lager with a curry thrown in. But now that the Lancashire fat lad has metamorphosed into an athlete the world watches with awe, bowling attacks have learned that \"getting Freddied\" has a new meaning. In his last 17 ODIs Flintoff averages 87.89 with the bat and has 20 wickets at 19.15. Zimbabwe, England's ICC Trophy opponents on Friday, will be quaking in their boots.</p>",
  "<p>Gary Neville, fast becoming the most vociferous opponent of Sven-Goran Eriksson's critics, took his support to a new level last night when he implored the Football Association to ignore the growing criticism of England's manager. </p> <p>\"The FA have got to remain in the same thought process, namely that we need a long-term manager in place,\" he said. \"Don't panic. Why panic? This is a 10-game league and all is not lost. I'm sure the FA will remain as strongly behind the manager as the players are.\" </p> <p>Showing a bullishness that Sir Alex Ferguson would have been proud of, the Manchester United defender made no attempt to conceal his irritation when he was questioned about Eriksson's future. </p> <p>\"Can I stop you there?\" he interrupted. \"How can you even mention the manager? Why are you asking about Sven-Goran Eriksson? Ask questions of the players. Blame it on us. We were the ones who threw away two points. But how can the manager be brought into the equation? </p> <p>\"I'm not saying he should never get criticism but on the basis of this match there is no way you can criticise the manager. Look at the bigger picture. For 70 minutes our performance was pretty damn good and we were in cruise control. Then we lost control. The manager didn't lose control - we did. You can't legislate for what happened in those three minutes. We were absolutely cruising before then. But it's nothing to do with the manager.\" </p> <p>Neville refused to accept that Eriksson was even partly responsible. \"I'm not saying there aren't things we need to sort out. Of course there are. But it's more to do with individual errors than tactics or formations.\" </p> <p>Adopting the Old Trafford philosophy that strength comes from adversity, he continued: \"There are lessons to be learned and we will improve because of it. Firstly, you can't give away goals like we did because if you do even average teams like Austria get their tails up. Until then it was a good away performance, but after that it degenerated into a scramble and it felt like we left two points on the pitch. </p> <p>\"We have to get over this disappointment because Poland on Wednesday will be an even harder game. They're higher in the world rankings and I don't expect the conditions to be as good for us over there. We had a similar disappointment against France in Portugal this summer and we have to get over it just like we did then. I hope we have enough experience to cope with that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mel Brooks once famously defined the difference between comedy and tragedy as follows: \"If you are walking down the street, fall into an open sewer and die, that's comedy. When I cut my finger, it's tragedy.\" </p> <p>The quote came to mind in the light of the hysterical overreaction to England's drawn World Cup qualifier in Vienna. Words such as \"grief\" and \"horror\", both of which figured in post-match analysis, seemed particularly inappropriate, given the ease with which you could flip to BBC News 24 and find the words used in their proper context. </p> <p>It was David James himself, in an interview on Talksport radio, who talked of \"grief\". The England players, he said, accepted collective responsibility for letting slip a match they should have won comfortably, and were prepared to \"share the grief\". </p> <p>Not that I would wish to excoriate the personable goalkeeper for an ill-chosen word. He is already going to be the most reviled man in England this week - unless he plays a blinder in Poland - so let us at least give him credit for emerging to face the press after the match. </p> <p>If only he could be persuaded not to come out of his goal for crosses quite so readily, there might not be so many critics queuing up to strap him to the ducking stool. </p> <p>The journalist Danny Fullbrook, a guest on Jimmy Hill's Sunday Supplement on Sky, was one of those who took a fundamentalist view of James's howler. \"When you have a horror like you did last night, he has to shoulder the burden,\" said Fullbrook. It was a fair point, although if Danny had cared to turn over the papers strewn around Jimmy's \"kitchen table\" and look at the truly horrific images on the front he might have talked of disappointment rather than horror. </p> <p>The good thing about Jimmy's show, though, of which regular readers will know I am something of an enthusiast, is that though the panellists tends to take football a little more seriously than is healthy, at least their comments come from a comparatively informed position; and as journos rather than football people they have fewer axes to grind and are less inclined to pull out of 50-50s than panellists more intimately involved in the game. </p> <p>Not being someone for whom football is a matter of life and death - although I fully accept that my happiness would be greatly enhanced by the return to the Premiership of West Ham United - I mostly follow proceedings round at Jimmy's place for the fruit. </p> <p>On fruit-watch yesterday, I think I spotted bananas for the first time. I may be wrong, but I am sure I have never seen a banana before among the orange juice, fresh fruit and croissants wilting gently under the studio lights. You can see why. Bananas are inclined to brown quite rapidly and could quite easily end up looking like the ones you buy cheap down the market, which would destroy the illusion that discussions are being broadcast live from Jimmy's kitchen-diner in well-heeled suburbia. </p> <p>My view on the fruit is that it is fooling nobody. Sportswriters, in my experience, are not much for fruit at breakfast time - one or two from the Guardian, possibly, or the Telegraph, under medical advice - but, though diets may not be balanced, views on England's draw with Austria were, more or less; which is more than can be said for Alan Green on Radio Five Live. </p> <p>Green, who admittedly might have been indulging in a little rabble-rousing to recruit callers for his post- match phone-in, sounded incandescent and described himself as \"livid\" over England's capitulation. He repeatedly called Austria \"a pub team\" and also suggested that Sven-Goran Eriksson might have been guilty of exacerbating Steven Gerrard's groin injury by playing the midfielder. </p> <p>It had the required effect, I suppose, with the first caller saying David James and David Beckham should be slung out of the squad, \"and Sven-Goran Eriksson can drive the taxi\". </p> <p>Pointless blather. And on the subject of pointlessness, Channel Five (or Five, as we are supposed to refer to it these days, the station having gone down that Madonna/ Sting single-name route) has launched a series of International King of Sports, with possibly the least attractive come-on line in the history of television: \"And now, live on tape from Cheltenham ...\" </p> <p>While you wondered what non-equine activity from the queenly Gloucestershire town could possibly be worth televising, the answer came in the form of the three-metres sprint (\"It's a sprint, and it's three metres,\" said the commentator. \"That's all there is to say.\") and the speed-gun run, in which competitors dash down a track before hurling themselves headlong into a black plastic-covered mattress. </p> <p>This rather undignified spectacle had unfortunate echoes of the leisure-time pursuits of Wayne Rooney, whose big-money transfer to Manchester United took up hours of Sky News's airtime in the early part of the week and about which I had intended to write, but which already seems to belong to a different world a long time ago. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: martin_kelner@yahoo.co.uk\"> martin_kelner@yahoo.co.uk</a> martin_kelner@yahoo.co.uk</p>",
  "<p> This was a particularly sweet victory for Peter Jackson, the Huddersfield manager, who has been aggrieved by criticism after an unconvincing start to the season. </p> <p>The fact that Huddersfield are newly promoted to League One has not been factored into the argument by a section of supporters unhappy about two wins in six games and demanding a vast improvement on their dismal show at Doncaster six days earlier. </p> <p>They were given it yesterday as Town responded with four goals and a passionate performance. \"It was the perfect answer,\" said Jackson. \"There were still moans and groans but we have to block it out.\" </p> <p>Hull briefly threatened their control early in the second half but their manager Peter Taylor, in Poland with the England team, will not have appreciated the report he received last night from his assistant Colin Murphy. </p> <p>Murphy refused to blame Taylor's absence, which has alarmed some Hull supporters. \"I don't think it affected our performance,\" he maintained. \"I didn't notice any problems with work rate and attitude.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless it was a disappointing performance - and Hull's supporters were short-changed by more than their team. Hundreds of them missed the start because of roadworks and were not even in the ground when Pawel Abbott gave Huddersfield a seventh-minute lead with a crisp shot from the edge of the area. </p> <p>They scored another in the 19th minute as Chris Brandon's dummy allowed Abbott's cross to reach Rob Edwards, who finished with aplomb. </p> <p>Junior Lewis led Hull's belated response, forcing a save from Ian Gray and going close again when Efe Sodje headed his drive off the line. </p> <p>But Hull's best period came at the start of the second half when Jason Price, Leon Cort and Marc Joseph all failed to make the most of excellent chances and left Murphy wondering what might have been. \"We battered them for 30 minutes and the outcome could have been different if we had scored,\" he said. </p> <p>Instead, the Huddersfield substitute Junior Mendes required only a minute to set up Brandon for his first goal for the club in the 74th minute. </p> <p>Hull's miserable day was complete when the Huddersfield defender Steve Yates handled in the box on 81 minutes but Danny Allsopp put the penalty too close to Gray. It earned Gray the \u00a350 bonus offered by Jackson before the match if he kept a clean sheet. </p> <p>Andy Booth added Huddersfield's fourth goal in the 87th minute and there could have been more for Jackson's team, notably when Mendes dragged his shot wide in stoppage-time.</p>",
  "<p>Not the taxpayers of Greece, given the bill that will be landing on their pay packets - although they will get a purpose-built weightlifting auditorium to enjoy for years to come. </p> <p>No, the real winners are the athletes who won gold - but even then, working out which nation really did best is a tricky business. </p> <p>In crude terms, it was the United States that came out top, with its 35 golds, followed by China and Russia. Obviously, countries with large populations will tend to do well because sheer weight of numbers will throw up more of the freaks of nature able to run faster or jump higher than the competition. </p> <p>But population size alone is not a good predictor of Olympic success. </p> <p>Look at India, with a population of a billion and just a silver medal to show for it. In any case, if China were to win every gold medal bar one awarded to the Bahamas, the Bahamas would still be ahead on a population per medal basis - with fewer than 300,000 people, the Bahamas come well out on top of this year's gold medal winners when ranked by population size alone. </p> <p>Modern sport, however, also requires a lot of expensive infrastructure - swimming pools, velodromes, professional leagues - in order for national success to be achieved. </p> <p>While black athletes from developing world countries are prominent in their success on the track, especially in the middle and long-distance running dominated by countries such as Ethiopia and Kenya, there were few non-European faces on the winners' podium at the poolside or in the yachting, equestrian, fencing, canoeing, cycling, rowing and shooting events. </p> <p>On the other hand, Asian countries dominate some sports, especially badminton, and the various martial arts disciplines such as judo and archery, although they tend to be industrialised Asian nations such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. </p> <p>There does appear to be a connection between wealth and medal size, though, as with India and its solitary silver, it does not tell the whole story. Switzerland, one of the world's wealthiest countries, could only manage a single gold, while tiny Luxembourg, another moneybags, could not manage a medal of any hue. </p> <p>So how can we tell who has done well, adjusted for size and income? Just dividing medals by total national income does not say much, because that does not account for population size. The answer is to use an international comparison beloved of economists - national income per head, adjusted for purchasing power parity. </p> <p>By dividing the number of gold medals won by individual national income, we have a comparison that takes into account cost of living differences between the wealthy and the less well-off but which does not penalise large developing countries. It also recognises the different performances between the wealthy winners. </p> <p>This throws up some interesting results, as we can see from the chart at the end of the article. China tops the table, its immense population size balanced out by the country's relatively low income. </p> <p>Ethiopia's modest population size and low national income shows what an achievement its two gold medals really were. The same also goes for Kenya. </p> <p>This new medal table also reveals that the American gold medal haul of 35 is impressive, not just because of the country's wealth or size, as is Australia's 17 golds. These figures show that both countries' successes are actually attributable to their being fiercely good at sport, especially compared with the large, wealthy laggards of Europe - Germany at 19th, France 23rd, and Britain down at 26th. </p> <p>Why count only gold medals, and not silver and bronze? Because total medal counts again favour the larger and wealthier countries, which compete in a host of different sports, thus picking up bronzes and silvers which the smaller nations have little or no chance to compete for. </p> <p>To even things out, it is worth looking at how the world's mightiest trade blocs stack up. Nafta - the North American Free Trade Area - encompassing the US, Canada and Mexico, manages 119 medals. </p> <p>The European Union - even sticking with the 15 members before the recent enlargement of the union, to make things fair - can boast 223 golds, silvers and bronzes. That is some trade surplus. </p> <p><strong> The real Olympic medal table</strong> </p> <p><strong> Rank country golds $ per gold</strong> </p> <p>1 China 32 145 </p> <p>2 Russia 27 299 </p> <p>3 Cuba 9 311 </p> <p>4 Ethiopia 2 390 </p> <p>5 Ukraine 9 533 </p> <p>6 Romania 8 811 </p> <p>7 Uzbekistan 2 820 </p> <p>8 Kenya 1 1010 </p> <p>9 US 35 1031 </p> <p>10 Georgia 2 1135 </p> <p>11 Australia 17 1614 </p> <p>12 Hungary 8 1633 </p> <p>13 Japan 16 1711 </p> <p>14 Jamaica 2 1840 </p> <p>15 Brazil 4 1862 </p> <p>16 Morocco 2 1865 </p> <p>17 South Korea 9 1884 </p> <p>18 Cameroon 1 1910 </p> <p>19 Germany 14 1927 </p> <p>20 Turkey 3 2100 </p> <p>21 Zimbabwe 1 2180 </p> <p>22 Thailand 3 2296 </p> <p>23 France 11 2458 </p> <p>24 Italy 10 2617 </p> <p>25 Belarus 2 2750 </p> <p>26 UK 9 2953 </p> <p>27 Azerbaijan 1 3010 </p> <p>28 Indonesia 1 3070 </p> <p>29 Greece 6 3128 </p> <p>30 Iran 2 3345 </p> <p>Source: World Bank, CIA Factbook </p> <p>'$ per gold' is gross national income per head, expressed in purchasing power parity of US dollars, divided by number of gold medals won</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Richard Adams is a leader writer for the Guardian</p>",
  "<p><strong> Wakefield Trinity</strong> secured a first appearance in the Super League play-offs with a 40-6 romp against <strong> Widnes</strong> yesterday. </p> <p>The Vikings scored first through Simon Finnegan, but Wakefield were well in control by half-time thanks to tries from Sid Domic and their outstanding young captain Gareth Ellis. Paul Handforth added two more as Widnes capitulated after their Australian scrum-half Willie Peters suffered a hamstring injury. </p> <p>Technically, <strong> Huddersfield</strong> could still catch Trinity, after their shock 22-20 win against <strong> Hull </strong> on Saturday, a remarkable performance as they came from 20-10 behind with two late tries despite being reduced to 11 men with Jim Gannon and Paul Reilly in the sin-bin. But the Giants remain four points behind Wakefield with only two matches to play, and a vastly inferior points difference. Hull have now lost three consecutive matches and slipped out of the top two for the first time in months. </p> <p><strong> Leigh</strong> are again the favourites to win promotion to the Super League after beating <strong> Whitehaven </strong> 21-14. The result takes Leigh above the Cumbrians on points difference at the top of National League One.</p>",
  "<p> Lancashire's dramatic slide into relegation peril degenerated into acrimony after they crumbled to a second heavy defeat of the season by Surrey late on Saturday afternoon. </p> <p>The captain Warren Hegg, who was left unbeaten when they were all out for 129 in their second innings, was involved in a series of angry exchanges with members calling for his resignation as he left the field. \"You're a coward,\" he yelled at one, then made a beeline for another in front of the pavilion to engage in a lengthy and animated discussion before finally returning to the dressing room. </p> <p>\"It just disappoints me that when we've got our backs massively against the wall, a minute section of our supporters get into our lads about being rubbish and not trying,\" Hegg later explained. </p> <p>Lancashire's manager Mike Watkinson, who like Hegg has also received abuse from members, stood foursquare behind his captain. \"Warren's a very passionate player with pride in his own individual performances and those of the team,\" Watkinson said. \"We can all relate to the way you feel when you're at your lowest, and somebody puts the last finger between your ribs.\" </p> <p>Hegg insisted that he will stay on as captain, at least until the end of the season, the wicketkeeper's third in charge. \"I'm not going to quit when we're in a battle,\" he added. \"We've still got two games to go, and if we win those we can stay up.\" </p> <p>But the prospects for Lancashire look bleak. They need to overtake two counties to survive but after taking only five bonus points against Surrey, they are 17 behind Worcestershire - who they play at New Road this week - and 22 behind Gloucestershire. </p> <p>Watkinson conceded that Lancashire's members are particularly angry because they started the season with such high expectations and were encouraged by an 11-match unbeaten run in all competitions. </p> <p>Key players such as Carl Hooper and Stuart Law suffered badly timed injuries and have returned horribly short of confidence. On Saturday neither looked remotely likely to play the big innings Lancashire needed to have any chance of reaching a victory target of 277 on a turning pitch. </p> <p>Nayan Doshi, Surrey's left-arm spinner, dismissed them both for the second time in the match on the way to figures of six for 57, beating the career-best five for 125 he had taken in the first innings. For Watkinson and Hegg, the fact Doshi had a trial with Lancashire's second team last year applied a final twist of the knife.</p>"
