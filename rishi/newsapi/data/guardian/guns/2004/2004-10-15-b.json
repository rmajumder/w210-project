  "<p>BSkyB was put on notice yesterday that it faces a potentially damaging shareholder revolt at next month's annual meeting over plans to buy back its own shares. </p> <p>The Association of British Insurers, whose members control about 20% of the stock market, warned the satellite broadcaster of a \"discernible groundswell of opposition\" against the proposed buy-back. </p> <p>Investors are concerned that the buy-back of 5% of the shares would allow Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation to increase its stake in the company from 34% to about 37%. </p> <p>The ABI yesterday issued an \"amber alert\" on the company ahead of its annual meeting on November 12. This is its second most serious level of alert. </p> <p>\"The company needs to note that if they were to propose another buy-back and the control of News Corp were to go up then opposition among investors would be even greater,\" an ABI spokeswoman said. </p> <p>When the buy-back was first announced in August, shareholders began to express their concern about the proposal which they fear could allow News Corp's stake to creep up. </p> <p>The company, which was forced to make a series of boardroom changes following a shareholder rebellion last year, had begun to try to assuage their fears by sending the new non-executive director Lord Rothschild to a series of meetings with major investors in recent weeks. </p> <p>Under the resolution to be voted on at the meeting, the satellite broadcaster is asking investors to grant it a waiver of rule nine of the takeover code which means News Corp can increase its stake in the company without paying a premium to BSkyB's existing investors. </p> <p>Investors have no hard and fast guidelines on such rule nine waivers. Some big City investors automatically vote against them while others consider each company's case on its merit. </p> <p>News Corp does not intend to use its vote at the meeting next month and it is thought that BSkyB is confident it has the support of some of its major shareholders ahead of the meeting. </p> <p>A BSkyB spokesman said: \"We are encouraged by the support expressed by a wide range of investors, particularly among our largest shareholders.\" </p> <p>The company is looking for the authority to buy back its shares for one year and had authority from its investors in the late 90s to buy back shares when News Corp owned 40% of the company. </p> <p>BSkyB has faced shareholder rebellions in the past. Last year the company endured protest votes over its pay policies and the structure of its board following the appointment of Rupert Murdoch's son James as chief executive.</p>",

  "<p>It has often been said that water will one day be as valuable a commodity as oil. With oil price currently topping $50 a barrel, that seems hard to believe, but with several cities around the world, including London, already facing shortages - now's the time to think about hydrogeology. Finding, extracting and treating water is now a multi-million pound business, and it's an industry that is crying out for trained staff in the UK.</p> <p>Until recently there was only one university in the UK offering a masters courses in hydrogeology and that was at Birmingham. Every year the 25 or so graduates leaving its course had the pick of jobs in a water industry that was desperate to recruit the right technical staff.</p> <p>But from now on, budding hydrogeologists have the choice of two courses - Leeds University has just joined the fray and is also offering an MSc in the subject. The first students to enroll have just started lectures and the college is already accepting applications for the course starting in autumn 2005.</p> <p>According to the woman behind the Leeds' course, Noelle Odling, it has been added to the curriculum to meet the demand for qualified staff. She says the course aims to attract a mixture of recent graduates and those who are a bit older and have some experience of working in the industry. There is a minimum entry requirement of a 2:1 in your first degree, which needs to have been along the lines of geography, geology or environmental science.</p> <p>\"We will take those who studied a variety of subjects - even mathematics or physics, providing they have an interest in the subject\", explains Noelle. All students are expected to have maths to A-level standard or similar.</p> <p>\"This one-year course is designed to give a thorough grounding in all aspects of hydrogeology from theoretical background, to field techniques and numerical modelling. The course includes, as distinctive features, the chemistry of pollutants in the subsurface and their remediation, and flow and transport in fracture aquifers.\"</p> <p>Students can expect to learn aquifer testing methods and how to deal with groundwater pollutants. Noelle says the course will be taught in the lecture hall and the field - a number of field trips lasting one to four days are planned. It is very much aimed at producing staff that can take up jobs within consultancies or for the water companies, as soon as they have completed the course.</p> <p>To gain their masters, students have to complete a dissertation and the course leaders are aiming to get most students working on real-life projects for one of the many consultancy firms that operate in the area.</p> <p>\"Due to present shortage of qualified hydrogeologists, we anticipate the career prospects for students with an MSc in this area to be very good for the foreseeable future,\" says Noelle.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:miles.brignall@tiscal.fr\">mailto:miles.brignall@tiscal.fr</a></p>",
  "<p>I'm beginning to think that Australians are the new Hollywood aristocracy. Americans in general are uncomfortable with the notion of a native-born aristocracy - \"no king, no knights\" is one of the precepts of the American Revolution - but, as their long-held fascination with the British royal family suggests, they don't object to importing aristocrats. In Hollywood terms we, the Brits, used to fill that role, and to a certain extent we still do. Laurence Olivier was for years on end the gold standard of thespian classiness, and today Anthony Hopkins is likewise the first actor a studio head thinks of if he wants the same lordly loftiness for his next blockbuster.</p> <p>But something about Britishness - the cliches about class, emotional reticence and general uptightness - goes against the grain of the supposed egalitarianism, optimism and emotional openness at the heart of America's sense of itself. Australia's national characteristics, however - sunny national disposition, \"mateship\", unpretentiousness - seem like a much snugger fit. And look at how many of Hollywood's current top dogs are of antipodean extraction: Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Naomi Watts. Alongside the zombie-Scientologists at Tinseltown's top table, they all look feverishly alive, and brainy to boot. I fear that we Brits - Jude Law and Kate Winslet excepted - may be displaced as imported poshies by denizens of a country we've often patronised and scorned as a cultureless convict colony. Serves us right.</p> <p>And then there's Cate Blanchett, Peter Jackson's elfin Galadriel, who's so exquisitely regal she's about to play Queen Elizabeth I again (in The Golden Age) as well as neighing Vassar princess Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biopic, The Aviator. There's something about her face, with those breathtaking rose-coloured cheekbones, that can stop a wild man in his tracks, soothe his savage soul and enslave him, and she's a very fine actress too. But she has yet to make a movie worthy of what one senses she's capable of. Pushing Tin, Charlotte Gray, Bandits, The Missing: all worthy performances in sub-par movies. Clever as she is, one feels she should be doing better work. Until she does, I'll settle for looking forward to whatever her next hair colour will be. That's always exciting.</p> <p><strong>Career Highs</strong> Elizabeth, Veronica Guerin.</p> <p><strong>Career Low</strong> The Shipping News</p> <p><strong>Need to know</strong> Says she took the role of Galadriel in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy because she wanted to wear pointy ears in a film. She had the prosthetics bronzed for prosperity.</p> <p><strong>The last word</strong> On her hair-colour: \"Look, it's one of the great mysteries of the world, I cannot answer that question. I think I'm vaguely blonde. To be perfectly frank, I don't know.\"</p>",
  "As desirable locations, they are a relatively easy sell. One has \"small architectural spaces\" with stunning views of St Paul's and the Millennium Bridge. Another is a historic site with 18th and 19th century interiors, blessed with family treasures, paintings and furnishings. Available for the right price, and both with off-street parking. <p>The attributes of Tate Modern and Syon House - the London home of the Duke of Northumberland - are rarely portrayed in such formal terms. But even the most majestic buildings are likely to find themselves described in estate agent-like language as London prepares to launch a major public relations offensive to sell itself to Hollywood as a huge, living film set. </p> <p>Next month, four executives from the agency Film London will fly to the US hoping to lure more Hollywood directors and their crews to the capital. </p> <p>Sue Hayes, London's film commissioner, said: \"We are going to sell London. There are meetings with key people and heads of production within the major studios.\" She said the wishes of the major stars or \"talent\" were increasingly important. </p> <p>\"It is becoming apparent that the talent likes coming here and that factor should not be underestimated. Julia Roberts was here this year and so was Woody Allen. There are some for whom the prospect of leaving the US is unattractive but if you say they get to spend a few weeks in London they will come.\" </p> <p>Londoners have been getting used to the idea of the city as a cinematic backdrop. With the London Film Festival opening next week, new figures show that the value of film production last year was \u00a31bn. The previous year it was just \u00a3550m. Crews were involved in 10,036 shooting days in 2003 compared with 7,829 the previous year. </p> <p>Some films, such as the gangster movie Layer Cake, Alfie, starring Jude Law, and Mike Leigh's Vera Drake, starring Imelda Staunton, have already hit the screens. Others, such as Creep, a horror movie filmed in the London Underground, and Bridget Jones, The Edge of Reason, await release. </p> <p>The focus has been on famous sites. But the expansion has been particularly marked in the East End, where the amount of filming has increased by a third in 12 months. Lesser known locations in places such as Tower Hamlets and Hackney are becoming popular. </p> <p>London Underground has released a list of the 10 greatest scenes featuring the city, as voted for by 1,000 film buffs. The James Bond movie, The World Is Not Enough, with its breathtaking boat chase along the Thames was top. At fifth was 28 Days Later, depicting a capital ravaged by a killer virus. According to Film London, the film awakened other directors to the possibilities of filming in the city. </p> <p>\"Shooting in east London is a fantastic experience. It is a vibrant place,\" said its director, Danny Boyle, who also made Trainspotting. </p> <p>But often, the ingenuity of film-making means that the backdrop doesn't matter. For Alfie, some scenes set in New York were actually shot in Hackney. For De-Lovely, the Cole Porter biopic, Hornsey town hall doubled as Arizona and Hollywood in the 1920s. </p> <p>Ms Hayes said the lower cost of filming was a factor and would become more so when directors benefited from Treasury tax credits. \"Five years ago London was seen as a difficult place to work but things are much better,\" she added. </p> <p>An executive film taskforce, led by Lord Puttnam, brings together Film London, the emergency services and officials from the London boroughs in an attempt to minimise bureaucracy. </p> <p>While they are welcomed to landmark sites, not all filmmakers are given free rein, however. At the Imperial War Museum, the Holocaust exhibition is \"out of bounds\".

  "<p><strong>The Book of Ash</strong><br>by James Flint<br>405pp, Viking, \u00a312.99</p> <p>James Flint has come up with the perfect means of rebelling against liberal parents. His hero, Cooper James, has spent his young life running around naked and unsupervised in a hippie commune. He gets his own back by taking a job in a nuclear defence facility.</p> <p>Computer-literate but socially inept, Cooper clings to a low-level programmer's position in a militarised base named Featherbrooks for fictional purposes, but instantly recognisable as the vast (since dismantled) white spheres of the early warning system at RAF Fylingdales.</p> <p>The giant golfballs used to be the most surreal feature of the Yorkshire landscape, arousing huge curiosity as to what went on inside them. Unfortunately, Cooper isn't in a position to tell us. He can't reveal what his job is, because he doesn't know himself. All he can say is that he spends his time punching in code for a top secret electronic surveillance system; and that were it not for the draconian security and knot of protesters outside, he might as well be vetting claims for an insurance company. If this sounds just a little disappointing, it's worth noting that Flint is frequently at his best when writing about disappointment: particularly that very English combination of inferiority and ennui which maintains that the great cure for disappointment must lie on the opposite side of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Flint's previous novel, 52 Ways to Magic America, was the story of a second-rate cabaret magician who abandons his dreams and joins the dotcom boom, having discovered that \"the light from his laptop illuminated an entrance. The land over the threshold is America.\" And though office life at Featherbrooks is far from scintillating, Flint relishes the fact that the facility is \"a little piece of America in England\".</p> <p>Cooper is granted an unexpected opportunity to explore the culture first hand when he is posted an anonymous package of radioactive waste, purported to be the mortal remains of his father. This unfortunate breach of security costs Cooper his job, prompting him to set off in search of further information about the fate of Jack Reever, a talented but feckless sculptor who walked out on Cooper and his mother for a new life in the States.</p> <p>The trail takes him first to Graniteburg, Vermont, the monumental masonry capital of America, before looping south towards the nuclear test sites of Nevada and finishing up in the sleepy settlement of Atomville, a town of immaculate picket fences and eerily perfect lawns, whose residents are hoping to have their nuclear reactor classified as a world heritage site. Flint modelled Reever on the real-life maverick American sculptor James L Acord, who actually spent his career trying to make artworks out of radioactive waste. Acord's own comment stands as the epigraph to the book: \"You can't make this shit up.\"</p> <p>Writing in the first person, Flint establishes a register of childish anguish and technical erudition which at its best is extremely funny, but at its worst comes across as a torrent of geek-ish pique. The text is periodically afflicted by atrocious verbs - a naked light bulb \"farts light\" - and once he seizes upon a metaphor he shows seeming reluctance to put it down: \"Water bombs explode across my glasses and obscure my view. Some kind of bunker seeking precipitation missile tunnels down inside my collar and obliterates secret forces bivouacked along the wind-scoured cliffside of my neck.\" It was raining, in other words.</p> <p>These outbursts of over-worked prose aside, the pace is swift, the suspense engaging and the sense of place never less than precise. Flint's depiction of Atomville as a proud, civic throwback to the days of nuclear optimism is delightful. Once inside the control room of the reactor he reports that it is all rather quaintly retro, trimmed with 1970s wood veneer and lined with, of all things, lava lamps: \"For generating the random numbers we need to seed our encryption codes\" explains an official. \"Plus, they look nice.\"</p> <p>So this strange atomic travelogue finally turns up something suitably esoteric. The reader's desire to penetrate the inner sanctums of these sinister, scientific temples is satisfied. Enter into the heart of those strange globes and what you'll find is that it's \"halfway between a porn set and a submarine\".</p>",
  "<p>\"Constance Spry is off the radar as far as I'm concerned,\" writes Sir Terence Conran (Letters, Guardian October 5). The vacuum-cleaner designer and manufacturer James Dyson has resigned as chairman of the Design Museum, which Conran reminds us he founded. There has been \"very little content\" at the museum, we learn from the press. Exhibitions devoted to Manolo Blahnik shoes and Philip Treacy hats are now followed by a tribute to the woman who, around the middle of the last century, created her own revolution in the world of flower arranging, or floral design.</p> <p>This seems to have been the last straw for Dyson and Conran in a boardroom battle for control of the museum's programme. Alice Rawsthorn, the embattled director, likes to run her own show, keep her board at arm's length. Dyson and Conran protest that the museum was founded \"to explore the industrial design of quantity-produced products\". The mission statement in the museum's foyer, per contra, speaks more simply of getting people excited about design.</p> <p>Clearly a messy divorce is in progress, and the wisest thing to do would be to steer clear of all parties. I'd like to say a word, though, not on behalf of Rawsthorn particularly, or indeed this latest show, which is a small affair put together on a shoe-string and not always well executed, but in defence of Constance Spry.</p> <p>\"High-society mimsiness\" is the charge thrown at her by this vain pair of board-room bullies, these horny-handed sons of industry. It is true that her shop, in her great days, was in Mayfair, and that royalty featured prominently among her clients. Imagine, though, the director of a photography museum refusing to countenance an exhibition devoted to Cecil Beaton or the amazing Vogue photographer Baron von Hoyningen Huen\u00e9 on the grounds that their clients were rich and glamorous. One would think that such narrow-mindedness, such a capacity for missing the point, would disqualify such a person from such a post.</p> <p>For better or worse, this was the style world of Constance Spry. It is the world of Beaton, of Syrie Maugham's interior designs, of Rex Whistler's drawings, of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar in the 1930s, but also the world of publications with titles like Women's Employment. The exhibition reminds us that Spry had some interest in social reform, and that floristry in her day was one of the few professions open to women.</p> <p>She wrote well, and it is worth picking up some of her books if you are at all interested in garden history. Among the important things she did (to the extent that any of this is important) was collect and maintain those varieties of old roses which appear in her illustrations, but which were at one stage in danger of being lost to cultivation: \"Cardinal Richelieu,\" \"Charles de Mills,\" \"Blanc Double to Coubert,\" \"Conrad Ferdinand Meyer\" - today such varieties are easily ordered from Peter Beales and David Austin. But when the great rosarian Graham Stuart Thomas was seeking out such varieties to preserve them, it was to Constance Spry he went. So if you enjoy the great rose garden at Mottisfont (where Thomas's collection of roses ended up), a part of what you are indebted to is the good taste of Mrs Spry.</p> <p>The principles on which her flower arranging was based are admirable. She was against rules, against prejudice, against \"anything which sets unnecessary bounds to one's imagination or limits one's train of thought, prohibition about the combination of certain colours, regulations about the proportion of flower to vase and the labelling of some plants for consumption and others for decoration\". In connection with this last false distinction, it was Spry who was first prepared to fill a tulip vase with leaves of Swiss chard, or incorporate citrus fruits or pomegranates in a bouquet.</p> <p>When you visit one of Conran's shops and find some amusing table decoration - a nice little aquarium full of broad beans or whatever some zany and fetching assistant has thought up that day - all that derives from Constance Spry. You like twig bundles (I don't) - she knew all about twig bundles, their virtues and drawbacks. The exhibition credits her with single-handedly overthrowing a flower-arranging rule that insisted on one species to a vase. She pioneered the mixed arrangement, but also the eloquent use of limited materials. The starting point of her philosophy was that wild flowers and weeds could be pressed into service, just as much as tuberoses. One could indeed spend a fortune. One could also spend next to nothing. This was the source of her popular appeal.</p> <p>What dates her is her passion for plaster of Paris containers, and for those wall-cornucopias and urns which she designed and promoted, and which will unfortunately loom large in any exhibition, because the alternative would have been to recreate a large number of her recorded arrangements. But if we sometimes laugh at the photos, we can surely loosen up enough to see that the whole thing has been executed with originality and esprit.</p> <p>I recommend a photograph, of which there is a marvellous print in the exhibition, by Hoyningen Huen\u00e9. In the volume Flowers in House and Garden it bears the title \"Whitewashed Leaves\": a kneeling blackamoor figure in the Venetian style bears a huge display of whitened palm fronds and heaven knows what. It's fun. It's dashing, perhaps unacceptable. It's part of the uncensored history of design.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Edwardians</strong> <br>by Roy Hattersley <br>528pp, Little,Brown, \u00a325 </p> <p>A 40-year-old woman, still a virgin, seduces her 20-year-old ward - to prevent him from resorting to prostitutes and for her own pleasure. Once she has educated him in affection, sexual manners and hygiene, she passes him on, now the complete article, to the woman he will marry. Such is the plot of one of the \"sex problem\" novels that became suddenly fashionable around 1905, half way through the reign of Edward VII. Preposterous though these novels were (how much sexual wisdom is the average 40-year-old virgin likely to have possessed?), they did at least think the unthinkable. They proposed a root-and-branch reform of the whole institution of marriage. Their unprecedented frankness is one reason for conceiving of the Edwardian age as modern. </p> <p>That is certainly how Roy Hattersley sees it. For him the Edwardians were, above all and in almost every respect, modernisers. \"Between the death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, and the outbreak of the Great War on 4 August 1914,\" he declares, \"a political and social revolution, accompanied and sustained by an explosion of intellectual and artistic energy, swept Britain into the modern world.\" </p> <p>There is a more cautious version of this thesis, to the effect that the period between the 1860s and the 1920s witnessed the gradual, uneven and incomplete emergence in Britain of a mass political culture. During that period, citizenship, rather than property, education and the \"character\" supposedly inculcated by these advantages, became the basis of civil rights. Not coincidentally, average per capita income rose from a tenuous 25% above subsistence level in 1870 to a more reassuring 150% in 1914. Hattersley, however, has decided to make the case for an abrupt and irreversible transformation. \"Modern Britain was born in the opening years of the 20th century,\" he writes. \"It is the legacy of the Edwardians.\" </p> <p>The turning point in this tale of transformation was the Liberal party's landslide electoral victory in 1906, and the subsequent \"New Liberal\" social legislation: most notably the Old Age Pensions Act of 1908, which substituted collective provision for (necessarily haphazard) individual foresight. Hattersley has little but praise for the \"constructive radicalism\" of two Liberal politicians, David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill, who became unlikely partners in \"social revolution\". As chancellor of the exchequer, Lloyd George was responsible for a groundbreaking budget that provoked conflict with the House of Lords and ultimately brought about profound constitutional change. As president of the Board of Trade, Churchill established a network of voluntary labour exchanges; as home secretary, he undertook to reduce the prison population substantially (his \"great contribution\", as Hattersley puts it, to the \"emancipation of the working classes\"). This is well-judged narrative history, shrewd and stirring in equal measure. It discovers in New Liberal activism a programme of modernisation strikingly at odds with that currently put forward by New Labour's Milburnite right-wing. </p> <p>Subsequent chapters usefully extend and complicate the picture. Some of the most dramatic developments during the period - mass strikes, militant suffrage campaigns, the arrival of 29 Labour MPs in the House of Commons in 1909, the prospect of civil war in Ireland - took place only in equivocal relation, at best, to New Liberalism's legislative putsch. Churchill was often the target for suffrage campaigners, and antagonised the trade union movement by sending in troops to break a strike at Tonypandy. Hattersley insists, however, that the Liberal government was on the side of the working classes, and not just for reasons of expediency; its \"wisdom\", he says, ensured that the British trade unions, and the Labour party they created, would remain \"implacably moderate\". </p> <p>Even more loosely associated with the political advance of social democracy was that \"explosion of intellectual and artistic energy\". Hattersley's survey of developments in poetry, drama, fiction, music, architecture and painting is a little too brusque to be entirely convincing. There are moments when he seems to be on the point of making a case for unsung modernisers such as Arnold Bennett or Walter Sickert, who believed that art should \"avoid the drawing room and stick to the kitchen\". But he never quite does. This is a shame. Bennett, for example, was thoroughly modern in the attention he gave to the new class brought into being by the rapid growth of clerical, teaching and other so-called \"tertiary\" occupations. </p> <p>The book finishes strongly, however, with absorbing chapters on the achievements (sometimes failures) of the explorers - Scott, Shackleton, Aurel Stein (who looted his way across Chinese Turkestan), Sir Francis Younghusband, head of a murderous \"trade delegation\" to the Dalai Lama - and the designers of planes, trains, automobiles, and battleships. Hattersley's journey around the Edwardian stiff upper lip is by no means uncritical. But it's hard to miss the relish with which he discerns, in wireless telegraphy, London to Manchester air-races and the like, the \"shape of things to come\". </p> <p>The age was modern in many ways, some of them complicated, not all of them cause for celebration. Hattersley overlooks one or two of the complications. He has nothing to say about the widely influential \"national efficiency\" movement, which was progressive in its advocacy of social reform, and beyond progressive in its demand for compulsory sterilisation of the unfit, but none the less reliant on ancien r\u00e9gime doctrines concerning the responsibilities created by privilege. Wells's political fable The New Machiavelli (1911) has pretty much all of this, as well as social mobility, sex problems, and a full complement of planes and battleships. </p> <p>Among Edwardian inventions not to be celebrated was scaremongering. Hattersley does allow a whiff of sulphur to escape from his vivid account of the \"Fleet Street revolution\", led by such as George Newnes and Alfred Harmsworth, whose ownership of the Daily Mail and the London Evening News gave him control of the \"market in mindless chauvinism\". That's too polite by half. Harmsworth ruthlessly exploited the anxiety provoked by the accelerating arms race between Britain and Germany to boost the circulation of the Daily Mail. In 1906, he commissioned the reliably paranoid sensational novelist William le Queux to describe (with some help from Field Marshal Earl Roberts, hero of the Boer and previous wars, and a champion of national efficiency) the invasion of Britain four years hence. The Germans land in Essex, and proceed somewhat erratically towards London by way of towns in which the Mail might hope to gain readers. Advertisements carried a map showing the route of the advance. Reports varied as to how much warning Londoners would get before the shells began to rain down in their midst: 45 minutes, anyone? The Edwardians at least had PG Wodehouse to restore some perspective. In The Swoop! (1909), the Germans land in Essex (as usual), the Russians at Yarmouth, the Mad Mullah at Portsmouth, the Swiss navy to the west of the bathing-machines at Lyme Regis and the Chinese at the picturesque Welsh watering-spot of Lllgxtplll. The race for London provokes gambling mania. \"The papers showed the positions of the various armies each morning in their Runners and Betting columns; six to four on the Germans was freely offered, but found no takers.\" </p> <p>Edwardian imagination, Edwardian true grit and the sheer effort and ingenuity they put into being modern all receive due acknowldgment in this rewarding book. What it perhaps leaves unsaid is that we don't get to choose our modernity. Scaremongering remains as much an element of the Britain the Edwardians created as old-age pensions. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> David Trotter is King Edward VII professor of English literature at Cambridge University and co-editor of Education Action.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Last Kingdom </strong> <br>by Bernard Cornwell <br>400pp, HarperCollins, \u00a317.99</p> <p>Our first sight of King Alfred in Bernard Cornwell's historical novel, The Last Kingdom, is of him crouched shamefully outside a tent, moaning in pain, vomiting, and grovelling for God's forgiveness: \"It seemed Alfred had humped a servant girl and, immediately afterwards, had been overcome by physical pain and what he called spiritual torment.\" Hardly the introduction we might have expected to the only English sovereign ever awarded the epithet \"the great\", or to the monarch whose statue defiantly holds a sword erect in the centre of Winchester. But Cornwell's portrait of a sickly and sinful young Alfred is faithful to The Life of King Alfred, a history believed to have been written in or shortly after his reign, by a Welsh bishop called Asser. </p> <p>The other early source for Alfred's life is the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle . Cornwell's novel - the first part of a trilogy set in Alfred's reign - closely follows the battles, treaties and successions laid out in this history: beginning in 867, when Alfred's elder brother \u00c6thelred was still king of Wessex and, according to the chronicle, there was \"an immense slaughter of the Northumbrians\" by Viking raiders at York; and ending in 877, one year before the young King Alfred infamously - though temporarily - lost control of the last English kingdom to the dreaded Danes. </p> <p>For most of this first volume, however, it is not from the scriptoria of the Saxons, but from the camps and dragon-boats of the Northmen, that the struggle for England is viewed. Cornwell chooses for his narrator a Northumbrian boy who is captured and raised by pagan Danes, before granting his allegiance to Alfred's West Saxons. Sitting between cultures, he wrestles throughout with issues of identity: \"Northumbrian or Dane? Which was I? What did I want to be?\" Such a scenario is not unlikely - in the north-eastern areas of the country, at that time when \"England\" was still being forged, there was much cultural amalgamation between Dane and Saxon. And such questions cannot help but have resonance for a modern audience, living in a post-devolution Britain that is again struggling to find an identity: English? British? European? Which are we? </p> <p>For Uhtred, Cornwell's young narrator, there can be little doubt that - although he finally swears his sword to the English Alfred - his heart tugs irresistibly towards the Danes. \"To exchange Ragnar's freedom for Alfred's earnest piety seemed a miserable fate to me,\" he muses. And it is difficult for the reader not to share much the same sentiment. While Cornwell's Danes roar with delight on the battlefield, revel in the salt-spray soaking their flaxen locks, and feast with carnivorous joy, his Saxons are mostly rule-bound, pious leek-eaters. In the historical notes to the novel, Cornwell asserts that he wished to escape the \"fanciful imagery\" that has become attached to the horn-helmeted figure of the Viking -but some cultural stereotyping surely remains in his depiction of the two contesting peoples. </p> <p>Cornwell's rather muted Saxons follow in a tradition of disregard for Anglo-Saxon history that has prevailed since the early 20th century. In the Victorian period, Alfred's life was \"the favourite story in English nurseries\" and the Saxons were hailed as the founders of just about every English institution. But two world wars against a Germanic nation made Saxon heroes distinctly less attractive to English writers and film-makers than Britons, Normans or Norsemen. How many Arthurian films stand beside the sole 1969 film Alfred the Great ? Alfred has waited many years for a novelist to update the Victorian image of him as an exemplar of the sort of moral, masculine boldness touted by 19th-century writers such as Thomas Carlyle; to give us instead the Alfred identified by recent historians - a politician who had the foresight to commission a Welsh bishop to write his biography. </p> <p>Certainly, Cornwell's Saxon king is a leader cast in a 21st-century mould: a subtle, shrewd ruler, he secures the loyalty of his followers as strategically as any corporation and, above all, knows the value of spin. Uhtred learns that Alfred \"had never been invested as the future king\", but \"to his dying day, insisted the Pope had conferred the succession on him, and so justified his usurpation of the throne that by rights should have gone to Aethelred's eldest son\". </p> <p>Myth-making is a subject that fascinates Cornwell, and which he has explored before. Here, the martyrdom of Edmund of East Anglia - tied to a tree and used for Viking target practice - and the self-mutilation of the nuns of St Abbs, who cut off their noses to avoid rape, are deconstructed. \"The tale is still sold as evidence of Danish ferocity and untrustworthiness,\" Uhtred states of the latter story. \"I remember one Easter listening to a sermon about the nuns, and it was all I could do not to interrupt and say that it had not happened as the priest described.\" Religious propaganda, in particular, receives short shrift in this novel, as in Cornwell's Arthurian trilogy. And its anatomy of how a Danish invasion in search of land and riches is conceptualised by English monks into a \"holy war\" surely has contemporary relevance. </p> <p>Cornwell's foregrounding of the constructed and politicised nature of histories gives him a licence to stir around his sources. The reader forgives slight deviations from them, or minor chronological rearrangements in the novel (an 878 battle in 877) because, after all, who knows how accurate Asser's account is? Some slips, though, might remain inexcusable to the avid Anglo-Saxonist: twice in this novel, Alfred's name mysteriously mutates to \"Arthur\" - the king who, throughout the 20th century, has so effectively supplanted the Saxon as the nation's favourite medieval monarch. </p> <p>It is difficult not to view this as portentous. Alfred may blossom from sickly lecher to triumphant hero in the remaining two volumes of this series. But if even Cornwell cannot shake off the shadow of the Excalibur-wielding Celt, then it remains to be seen whether, for near-forgotten Alfred, The Last Kingdom will represent a renewed role as national icon - or just the last gasp. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Joanne Parker is junior research fellow in the department of historical studies at Bristol University.</p>",
  "<p>The average British concert-goer could probably name three or four Swedish singers without too much trouble. From Jenny Lind onwards, we have had a strong presence on the international platform, and these days there must be more of us abroad at any one time than there are in Stockholm. But what if I asked you to name the same number of Swedish composers? You might know Wilhelm Stenhammar; perhaps Franz Berwald would ring a bell. After that, even the most wide-ranging concert-goer would admit it gets difficult.</p> <p>For this reason my cellist colleague and friend Mats Lidstr\u00f6m has dreamed up the From Sweden festival. Over the next eight months a succession of Swedish artists will be passing through the Wigmore Hall and the Barbican with programmes that, unusually, include their own native music, often alongside pieces by British composers. It's an occasional series, so the music will come more as scattered showers than as a downpour, but that's one of its strengths - people will have the opportunity to get interested, then come back and hear things they wouldn't normally encounter.</p> <p>There is an official excuse for this to be happening now, in that 2004 marks the 350th anniversary of a historic treaty between Sweden and Britain, drawn up by Queen Christina and Oliver Cromwell. However, any time is a good time to explore another country's music. Sweden's music is, I think, even riper for discovery than most. The pianist Bengt Forsberg and I have been including Swedish songs when we give recitals abroad for some years now, and the reaction to them is always positive. In fact, it's often one of surprise - people are taken aback by how good they are.</p> <p>I'm biased towards vocal music, but in this case I think my enthusiasm is justified. Sweden has a longstanding tradition of singing. Even the language has a singing quality to it.</p> <p>Swedish song went through a golden era during the early years of the 20th century, and there is so much for a performer to choose from that it can sometimes be hard to know where to start. If any one person defined that era, however, it was Wilhelm Stenhammar. He wasn't the country's first important composer - that was Franz Berwald, who wrote four influential symphonies during the 1840s, among many other works - but he was a pivotal figure on the Swedish music scene until his early death in 1927, aged 56. Though basically self-taught, Stenhammar was a prolific composer in many forms, writing orchestral music, string quartets, operas - and dozens of songs that, full of sentiment without being sentimental, are among the most memorable in the repertoire.</p> <p>Yet several of those around Stenhammar were scarcely less productive. His circle included Emil Sj\u00f6gren, who wrote around 200 songs, and Tor Aulin, another composer of very fine vocal music, who led a string quartet with which Stenhammar used to tour as a pianist. Then there are fabulous songs by Ture Rangstr\u00f6m, Wilhelm Peterson-Berger (himself a scathing and much-feared critic), Hugo Alfv\u00e9n... In fact, almost every composer at that time seems to have felt that he had something interesting and important to say in the form of song.</p> <p>This was also a period of great renewal in visual art and poetry, with Swedish poets and authors such as Bo Bergman and P\u00e4r Lagerkvist becoming household names, and a coinciding upsurge in nationalism. It's not surprising, then, that these composers should have felt compelled to set these poets' words to music.</p> <p>All of them wrote in larger-scale forms, too: Alfv\u00e9n, for example, was highly regarded as a choral composer, and Peterson-Berger was drawn towards large-scale Wagnerian music-drama. Yet it's in miniature that the country's music has flourished most effectively. I'm not sure why small forms should appeal to us Swedes so much, but if you want reinforcement of the notion that we are all meek, gentle and shy, look no further.</p> <p>You can hear a kind of national characteristic in the music, too. It has an overriding sense of melancholy, a bittersweet longing for something undefined, yet it's not the kind of big tragedy you find in Russian music. Without being too indulgent, there's the feeling that this yearning is something you could actually, secretly, quite enjoy.</p> <p>After Stenhammar's circle faded from view in the 1950s, the Swedish music scene went through a profound shift in aesthetics, with a kind of modernist mafia called the Monday Group assuming what was effectively a monopoly. For a while, only the most astringently radical and progressive music would do.</p> <p>In such a small country, it was possible for a clique like this to control radio, the education system, the academy: everything. I should add that these were all fine composers: Karl-Birger Blomdahl died in 1968 but his opera Aniara lives on; Ingvar Lidholm is still alive today, with many impressive works to his name. But it was too bad for composers such as Laci Boldemann and Bo Linde, who wrote evocative, lyrical songs a decade or two too late - such as Boldemann's Four Epitaphs, to English words by Edgar Lee Masters, or Linde's Naive Songs - and the extraordinary Allan Pettersson, who wrote 17 unfashionable but tremendous, almost Mahlerian symphonies, and who died in 1980 a fierce old man, racked by rheumatism and angry with the world.</p> <p>Today, though, Swedish music is thriving on many fronts. Anders Eliasson, Anders Hillborg, Sven-David Sandstr\u00f6m and others are making a big impact with their symphonic and orchestral music. Swedish Radio funds new works for the Radio Choir, so the choral tradition is still going strong. Composers such as Hans Gefors, Daniel B\u00f6rtz and Sandstr\u00f6m are carving out a more prominent standing for Swedish opera and, as teachers at our academies, are inspiring a new generation of composers to write for the stage.</p> <p>Yet few people write for piano and voice. I've asked some of the composers I know whether they would be interested, but they say they find it difficult. Maybe they are not confident that they could ever top what was written a century ago.</p> <p>With all this going on, why doesn't Swedish music enjoy a higher profile? From the point of view of the songs, the language is obviously a barrier. Some have been translated, but if you don't know how Swedish is pronounced (and, let's be honest, that applies to almost all non-Scandinavian singers), you'd have to persuade someone to help you before even beginning to tackle the rest. A more general problem, affecting all genres, is that people tend to lump us together culturally with the other Nordic countries. While everyone can hum along to Sibelius's Finlandia or Grieg's Piano Concerto, there's no equivalent work by a Swedish composer that has achieved such universal popularity.</p> <p>It is helpful to remember, though, that if British unfamiliarity with Swedish music has inspired From Sweden, the reverse also applies: very little British music finds its way onto concert programmes in Sweden. Vaughan Williams's symphonies, for example, are almost unknown there, and one rarely hears anything at all by Elgar. Would some British performer like to return the favour and come to Stockholm to organise From Britain? It might not be such a bad idea.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mats Lidstr\u00f6m, Bengt Forsberg and the English Chamber Orchestra Ensemble perform works by Berwald and Kallstenius on October 18, and Malena Ernman performs songs by Sj\u00f6gren on October 22, both at the Wigmore Hall, London.

  "<p>In the third bay of the north aisle of the Duomo in Florence is Paolo Uccello's fresco portrait of John Hawkwood. Painted in terra verde against a dark red background, it is barely visible at first in the penumbra (Michelangelo criticised these badly lit cathedrals as places where nuns could be raped and criminals could hide). The figure of Hawkwood emerges only slowly out of the brooding greyness. We see him on horseback, riding towards the high altar, beneath the vortex of Brunelleschi's impossible dome. The simple Latin inscription translates: \"This is John Hawkwood, British knight, esteemed the most cautious and expert general of his time.\" </p> <p>The fresco's dimensions - 25ft from top to bottom - its imperial gravitas, and its position opposite the doors leading out of the cathedral, all testify to the importance of its subject. There can be few more assertive sites than this in the narrative of the Renaissance. </p> <p>When he viewed the fresco, Byron was disgusted. \"Ungrateful Florence!\" he exclaimed, for failing to provide a commensurate memorial to \"the all-Etruscan three\" - Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio. \"Florence, who denied Dante a resting place, erected a noble monument to a robber,\" complained the Victorian writer Ferdinand Gregorovius, who took the honour accorded to Hawkwood as a personal affront. But Gregorovius was surely right to question how an English \"robber\" was chosen above the Italian laureates to enter the pantheon of \" uomini illustri \", great and famous men. </p> <p>The second son of a minor Essex landowner, Sir John Hawkwood earned his spurs fighting for Edward III during the Hundred Years War. By 1360, when hostilities were suspended by a truce, Hawkwood was \"but a poor knight\", and merited no attention in the lists or chronicles. Rather than returning to England, he joined one of the many groups of demobilised soldiers who launched a campaign of terror across France. He may have achieved little as one of the king's knights, but as a freelance he was ruthless and brilliant. </p> <p>In 1361, Hawkwood and 6,000 of his fellow mercenaries crossed the Alps. Italy was Europe's richest and most dynamic country, but it was also the cockpit of its political, religious and dynastic quarrels. Despots and city states were locked in a series of internal wars. Hawkwood's scheme was to hold Italy to ransom. The systematic use of \"frightfulness\" - bloodletting, raiding, pillaging, destroying crops, taking hostages - was his instrument. </p> <p>The Italians cringed as the mercenaries approached, denounced them as \"devils in human shape\", but rushed to hire them nevertheless. Hawkwood commanded an exorbitant price for his services, forcing the cities and towns of Italy to buy themselves back from him with tiresome regularity. As gold florins flowed out of their coffers and into his, he became a financial force to rival the most prestigious banks and international trading houses. He earned a reputation as \"the ablest military commander\" of the day. And he moved with ease in the fissile world of Italian politics, the first Anglo-Saxon to gauge the profound nervous tension that drove that volatile country. </p> <p>Milan, Bologna, Pisa, Lucca, Siena, Perugia, Naples - every city, and every village and hamlet in between, was marked by Hawkwood's passing. But the object of his especial interest was Florence. Time and again, the city paid extortionate levies to buy him off. But the money only encouraged him to seek more. </p> <p>Hawkwood's wooing of Florence was brutal, and she was, understandably, a reluctant bride. The relationship progressed awkwardly until finally, in 1375, he was contracted to defend the city and given an annual pension for life (unprecedented for a foreign mercenary). He was often released to pursue other contracts all over the peninsula, but he remained faithful to Florence until he died in March 1394. </p> <p>Hawkwood's activities shocked an age accustomed to atrocity, and inspired the proverb \" Inglese italianato \u00e8 un diavolo incarnato \" (\"An Englishman Italianised is a devil incarnate).\" Petrarch denounced him, Boccaccio tried in vain to mount a diplomatic offensive against him, Saint Catherine of Siena begged him to leave Italy, Chaucer met him and, arguably, used him as a model for The Knight's Tale. </p> <p>So why do we find this diabolical Englishman so elaborately memorialised in the Duomo of Florence? By what strange process had the memory of his \"perfidious and most wicked\" deeds been erased? </p> <p>By the end of the 14th century, the cost to Florence of hiring mercenaries had increased some 2,000% compared with 50 years before. It was a massive outlay, but it yielded handsome returns: by 1406 Florence had swallowed many of her weaker neighbours and commanded a region of over 7,500 square miles. One contemporary, Gregorio Dati, estimated the republic's outlays for warfare during the years 1375-1405 to be 11,500,000 florins (a sum 200 times greater than the capital formation of the Medici bank in its heyday). No one, added Dati, would have believed there was so much money in the world. </p> <p>But there was money enough to fund those artists whose works extolled the integrity and vitality of the new territorial state. Their brushes and chisels tipped with the gold florins of the Florentine government, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Paolo Uccello, Fra Lippo Lippi, Domenico Veneziano, Andrea Castagno, Donatello and Ghiberti painted or sculpted their way into the Renaissance, while Giorgio Vasari provided the textual commentary to prove there was one. </p> <p>There was no shortage of political, military and diplomatic narratives for these artists to focus on. The city's great humanist chancellors and historians (Coluccio Salutati, Leonardo Bruni, Donato Acciaioli) had made sure of that. Reminding Florentine citizens of their descent from the Roman Republic (a dubious claim), these scholar-propagandists celebrated the ambition and shrewdness that had turned their vision of history into a present reality. The decision to commission a portrait of Hawkwood was of a piece with this desire to retrieve a glorious past. </p> <p>On May 18 1436 the operai - the guildmasters, or board of works - of the Duomo declared that Hawkwood's figure should be painted in fresco form. Two weeks later it was confirmed that Paolo Uccello was to undertake the commission, for a fee of 15 florins. Uccello worked swiftly: by June 28 at least the horse and rider were complete. But the capo maestro of the Duomo was dissatisfied with what he saw - he was unhappy with the perspective, which showed too much of the horse's stomach and sexual organs, and ordered its partial destruction. The second version was complete by August 31, and Uccello was paid his 15 florins. </p> <p>The fresco shows Hawkwood riding a white ambler, holding the baton of command in a relaxed gesture: he is not brandishing a sword in the fury of battle, but is on parade, at the moment when the captain's role as servant of the state is most apparent. His armour is in the classical tradition, establishing a rhetorical link between the wearer and his Roman ancestors. This was an image designed to exert a kind of arcane power over the city. As well as broadcasting this message to Florentines, it advertised a larger political statement to outsiders: like the Romans, we honour our generals; like the Romans, we win our wars. </p> <p>It was Uccello's job to transmit the values of his patrons, but there's something deeply ambivalent about his portrait. He has framed Hawkwood with a grandiloquent language of gesture and equipment, which speaks to the credentials of the knight. The word \"chivalry\" derives from \"cheval \", horse, and Uccello has given Hawkwood a noble mount that lifts him above other men. All these elements - the armour, the horse - give the subject immense power. But, for all this, Hawkwood himself appears as a sort of ghostly chessman, subordinated to the horse he rides. </p> <p>Was Uccello consciously playing on ambivalences of time and state by portraying his subject almost as a cadaver? With his shrivelled face and hollow eyes, Hawkwood looks more dead than alive. He looks, indeed, like the \"pale rider\" of the Apocalypse. </p> <p>It was a terrifying message. But when the citizens of Florence gathered in the Duomo in 1436 to celebrate its reconsecration as Santa Maria del Fiore, did they see in Uccello's newly painted fresco a ghostly epic that could never be exorcised? Here they were, the bankers and lawyers, merchants and soldiers, wives and prostitutes - the whole lively cross-traffic of Dante's Commedia. Why should they be frightened? Were they not content to reflect that the new age that was already upon them, the Renaissance, had in some measure been delivered by the diabolical Englishman, the robber on the wall? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Frances Stonor Saunders's Hawkwood: Diabolical Englishman is published by Faber &amp; Faber on Thursday, price \u00a317.99.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The World that Was Ours </strong><br> by Hilda Bernstein<br> 394pp, Persephone Books, \u00a310<br> </p> <p>Celebrating 10 years of non-racial democracy in South Africa - and perhaps taking it for granted now - many may forget just how awful apartheid was. Or forget those who struggled so hard to defeat it. </p> <p>If so, there is an Orwellian reminder in the publisher's notes to Hilda Bernstein's book: the names of the people whose identification in its original publication in 1967 would have led to their immediate arrest. </p> <p>Published to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the end of the Rivonia trial in 1964, at which Nelson Mandela and colleagues received life imprisonment, Bernstein's updated addition is a vivid chronicle of her own and her architect husband Rusty's anti-apartheid activities. </p> <p>Having come from a broadly similar background - the eldest in a family of two boys and two girls, with an architect father and caring mother, both very close to their children, heavily involved in the anti-apartheid struggle, imprisoned, then banned, our home under surveillance by the special branch, often raided, then eventually forced to leave and settle in London - I found her story very familiar and instantly empathised, more so than with any other anti-apartheid family of exiles I can recall. </p> <p>There was of course one fundamental difference: the Bernsteins began their political activities in the Communist party in Johannesburg shortly before the second world war. My parents, some five years younger, were not to do so until 1953. Then, living in the small Natal town of Ladysmith, they joined the newly formed non-racial Liberal party of South Africa, only becoming really active on our return to Pretoria in 1958 from two years working in England. </p> <p>The Bernsteins had both been arrested as early as 1946 for assisting a strike of African mine-workers. They were both banned from gatherings in 1955. Rusty was one of the accused in the 1956 treason trial, attending court for two years until acquitted, only to be promptly detained with Hilda for three months under the 1960 state of emergency. </p> <p>So they had been heavily engaged for some 14 years before my family started to experience similar harassment and hardship. We met Hilda for the first time in the 1960s when she called at our Pretoria home seeking help for locally held black detainees. This was the time of the state of emergency declared after the Sharpeville shootings, and by then my parents were regular visitors to black townships, as they were increasingly drawn into the same struggle, being jailed in 1961, followed wherever they went by the special branch, and then both subject to banning orders blocking them from political activity and even social contact. However, the Bernsteins had it much tougher. </p> <p>At the time of the Rivonia arrests in July 1963, Rusty had already spent nine months under house arrest: only able to leave his house between 6.30am and 6.30pm (except on Sundays and public holidays, when he couldn't leave at all), obliged to report to police HQ between noon and 2pm each day and confined to the Johannesburg magisterial district. </p> <p>He had been carrying out his architectural work from their bedroom since his release from jail in 1960 and Hilda's description of the family waiting for him to get home before the 6.30pm deadline on the day that he was arrested at Rivonia makes riveting reading. </p> <p>Though acquitted at Rivonia, Rusty was immediately rearrested, charged with breaches of the catch-all Suppression of Communism Act (you were a communist if the minister said so), then released home on bail, with a trial date two-and-a-half months ahead. Police raids and the arrest of colleagues increased. It became obvious that they would soon be picked up and after much agonising over letting down the struggle and worry about their children's future, they decided they had no alternative but to leave. </p> <p>Soon afterwards Hilda describes how she was alerted by an obviously bogus phone caller stating he had a message for her that must be delivered personally and would be coming round shortly, so when the special branch knocked, she left by the back door, over the fence to a friend's home and away to a safe house. </p> <p>After arranging an escape route to Bechuanaland (now Botswana), Rusty joined her. There were many problems en route, but they got away safely. Her description of their escape after the tell-tale phone call could have come straight from a thriller, except that it is typically low key and matter of fact. </p> <p>Like many others they went into exile in London. Two years later, in 1966 when I was 16, we arrived there too, another family of reluctant exiles, my parents also feeling guilty at leaving their comrades behind. </p> <p>By the end of the 1960s I had myself become heavily involved in the struggle, in campaigns against tours by South African apartheid sports teams and in the Anti-Apartheid Movement, where I met both Hilda and Rusty. Later Rusty and my father worked together to get the Royal Institute of British Architects to sever its connection with the South African Institute of Architects, then essentially an all-white organisation. They were unsuccessful, but my father valued that association with Rusty, who sadly died in 2002. </p> <p>Any family like ours will recognise what became \"normal\" for a family as heavily committed to the struggle as the Bernsteins: the disruption of day to day living by constant police surveillance, police raids, and restrictions such as house arrest or banning orders. Then the more personal things such as career difficulties (my father was stopped from working by the authorities). The erosion of personal friendships within the white community (except with those sharing non-racial attitudes), including close relatives (aunts and uncles turned their backs on us - something very difficult for children to comprehend). Then finally the trauma of leaving a life in the sun behind and the agony of adjustment to the new, grey life of exile, which propelled too many into emotional turmoil (children especially - a friend of ours, brilliant schoolboy cricketer and top of his class, committed suicide). </p> <p>Barely 40 years ago, and yet - with Mandela a revered figure head, Robben Island a tranquil museum and all those agents of the police state nowhere to be found - The World that Was Ours seems now like another planet. A world that Hilda Bernstein graphically depicts of imprisonment without trial under the 90-day law for the Rivonia arrestees, each in his own cell, black and white prisoners in separate prisons, their petty restrictions, the refusal to allow the visits of relatives except in exceptional conditions. The latter changed once they were charged with sabotage, a death-sentence offence, and became awaiting-trial prisoners who were allowed one visit a day. Then the trial itself, which concluded with life sentences for Mandela and colleagues, though acquittal for Rusty. And finally the escape. </p> <p>Most first-hand accounts by those who fought apartheid tend to be detailed, historical and not overly personalised. Rusty's 1999 book, Memory Against Forgetting, is one such. Hilda's is not. It is a very personal and gripping story which shares her emotions with the reader - she tells how it all happened and how it feels when it happens to you. That is why it is so readable, so fascinating and so important an account of one of the truly heroic struggles to end in complete victory. </p> <p>Were it not for ordinary heroes like the Bernsteins, South Africa would not be free today. Now living in Cape Town, Hilda was among 16 who in June this year received the Order of Luthuli from the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, for her \"contribution to the attainment of a free and democratic society\". Anybody who reads this book will be left in no doubt that it is an honour well deserved. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Hain is leader of the Commons and secretary of state for Wales.</p>",

  "<p><strong> Dark Voyage</strong> <br>by Alan Furst <br>272pp, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, \u00a312.99</p> <p>The port of Tangier, April 1941. Mediterranean evening falls, as always, subtle and slow. Clouds drift over the hill behind the port, while, down in the town, patrons of the caf\u00e9s and souks are \"gathering for love and business\" as the light fades away. Out on the water a Spanish destroyer stands at anchor surrounded by merchant steamers, \"their hulls streaked with rust, angular deck cranes hard silhouettes in the dark\", among which we find the Noordendam, a tramp freighter of the Netherlands Hyperion line, \"built around 1920, five thousand gross tons, some four hundred feet long and fifty-eight wide\", blunt in the bow and wide in the stern. </p> <p>Alan Furst's novels are rich with such specifics, facts brought alive by their context, which is always the warmth of human life, a warmth that would fade from history if we allowed it to. At the same time, his characters have a strangely distanced feel, as if the huge events that surround them have overpowered their individuality, rendered it a little thin (though never less felt, never less urgent than before). You see this best in his lovers, and his scenes between lovers; but also in glimpses of people burning maps, taking leave, shrugging, committing themselves to action, watching their lives go out the window without time to comment - the very opposite to our current way of being individual. </p> <p>Eric Mathias DeHaan, captain of the Noordendam, is invited - ordered, he suspects, might be the more honest word - to dine with three men and a woman in the private room of a restaurant on the rue Raisuli. The woman is an artist, the men are patriots. They eat, they talk. By the end of the evening, DeHaan has been commandeered by the Dutch Navy in exile. On his way back to his ship he realises something else, which is that none of them expects to see him again. Neither he nor the Noordenstam will be doing anything as obvious as firing a gun: both of them have enlisted in naval intelligence. </p> <p>Painted and repainted, passed on to the British, in convoy and alone, under its own name and others, the ship's \"adminstrative status\" changing from depart ment to department of naval intelligence, the Noordendam takes a tour of the war. It carries commandos to Cap Bon, Tunisia; 5,000 tons of explosives to Crete. It receives orders in Algeciras, a cargo in Alexandria. Eventually it is nosing through the Baltic minefields, carrying an entire listening station designed to \"write the life story\" of every German submarine, from its birth in the Baltic yards to its death in the Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, his emotional damage mounting quietly with the damage to his ship, DeHaan makes the transition from contemplative sea captain to Furst's favourite viewpoint character, the contemplative man of action - a man who begins by slipping through life, curious but dissociated, yet ends up engaged. </p> <p>In keeping with his humanity, DeHaan remains an amateur. A war comes to you. It is episodic. There isn't time to achieve the control of events that is such a feature not just of contemporary thrillers, but of contemporary character models. DeHaan is never quite sure who's shooting at him, or where from. He watches his first air raid as dreamily as if it were a fireworks display, nothing to do with him; then suddenly his ship is on fire, he's gone mysteriously deaf and he's lying on his back covered in broken glass. Love is episodic too, small amours lived out under the anxiety of observation - who knows who you're with? Who might need to know? - full of the small pains of inevitable separation, but also of a kind of matter-of-fact joy. Is this really a chance encounter? DeHaan asks himself. But afterwards he's \"content to lie still, pleasantly sore, a little light-headed, as though cured of a malady he didn't know he'd had\". And when he asks her the next morning about the word she whispered, in some other language, in the night, it turns out to have been \"Hello\". </p> <p>Furst's characters live in interesting times. As a consequence, this, the eighth of his addictive, beautifully humane novels, reflects the narrative curve of history, the biographical curves of real lives. By the time the Noordenstam reaches the apogee of its clandestine career at the Finland coast, it has become a kind of political reserve. Everyone's on board, from Greek deserters to half the Russian National Ballet; a Ukrainian Jew, a leftwing Spanish drunk to a burned-out spy called S Kolb and Maria Bromen, a Soviet journalist fleeing her masters. It's in her mouth that Furst puts the frail, powerful conclusion which sums up all his books: \"Better to do what you want, and then what will happen will happen.\" His fans won't ask for more than that, and if you haven't read him yet, Dark Voyage is the place to start. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>M John Harrison's latest novel is Light (Gollancz).</p>",
  "<p>Unknown Seas: How Vasco da Gama Opened the East, by Ronald Watkins (John Murray, \u00a38.99) </p> <p>The Portuguese sea captain Vasco da Gama was the first to sail around the Cape of Good Hope to India - a feat equivalent in its time, says Watkins, to a mission to Mars. Watkins's account of the volatile cultural melange of India in the 15th century is fascinating and he is also good on the limitations of the Christian mindset: Gama mistook Hindus for corrupted Christians (mishearing \"Khrishna\" as \"Christ\"), and most Europeans assumed it was far better for black Africans (those \"sons of Cain\") to live in Christian bondage than to remain in Africa and burn in hell eternally. Gama left India in something of a hurry, but returned in triumph to Lisbon with spices and precious gems, and eventually became a wealthy man. Watkins takes us on every step of Da Gama's voyage, but his real mission is to talk up Portugal's massive contribution to world exploration. <strong>IP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Human Mind and How to Make the Most of It, by Robert Winston (Bantam, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p> Aristotle thought the brain was \"an organ of minor importance\", but Professor Winston disagrees: \"This is the organ of consciousness, of original thought and inspiration, the means by which we feel soaring joy, burning rage and perceive the glory of God.\" It may look like \"a gigantic, convoluted fungus\" but it's \"the most complicated structure on this planet\". Winston's fascinating guide to the wonders of the brain is a very readable fusion of pop science and self-help guide, with handy hints on how to \"boost our intelligence\". If you read this review backwards it might not make sense, but it's a great \"mental workout\". Exercise is also good for the little grey cells: five minutes of \"general jumping around at the start of the day\" helps concentration. But best of all is the news that red wine refreshes parts of the brain that other liquids can't reach: the connections between neural cells. Just what the doctor ordered. <strong> PDS</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Secret Voyage of Sir Francis Drake, by Samuel Bawlf (Penguin, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p> The secret, privily kept through falsified maps and cleverly inaccurate records, is just what Drake and the crew of the bark Pelican, afterwards the Golden Hinde, were doing so far up the Pacific coast of North America - almost as far as Alaska, in fact - in 1579. Which was exploring for a northwest passage that wasn't there. This discovery is researched via lying charts and erased atlases and Devon sailors' yarns (being Plymouth-born, I'd not trust a word of those, other than a mariner's description of a flying fish as of \"the bigness of a reasonable Pilchard\"). It's less fascinating, though, than Bawlf's abridgement of Drake's global circumnavigation on his surviving small trawler of a vessel. He's especially fresh on the mutual English-Spanish hostage-taking of pilots up the coast of South and Central America and piracy not only of the ritual gold bullion but of cargoes of sarsaparilla, lard, honey and maize. <strong>VR</strong> </p> <p><strong> The Faber Book of Exploration, edited by Benedict Allen (Faber, \u00a39.99)</strong> </p> <p> \"We are all explorers,\" says Allen in his introduction, and for a moment we believe him, until we read about his first solo expedition at 22, when he got lost on the bank of a remote Amazon tributary and had to walk for three weeks with only a dog for company, nibbling the tips of ferns, fishing for piranha and, eventually, eating the dog. This chunky tome would have been much slimmer if Allen had saved his personal reminiscences for another book, but you'll be glad he didn't. Each part is arranged chronologically, with entertaining potted biographies by Allen. Here are the thoughts of Marco Polo, Columbus, Cook, Van der Post, Thesiger and Matthiessen, as well as a Chinese monk, a Sioux Indian, a shaman, an emissary for the Caliph of Baghdad and several diplomats, botanists and missionaries. There are even some women - who are better, says Allen, at absorbing the essence of a place, whereas men tend to trample through it. <strong> IP</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Man Who Changed Everything: The Life of James Clerk Maxwell, by Basil Mahon (Wiley, \u00a38.99) </strong> </p> <p> Basil Mahon describes Maxwell's 1861 proposal of electromagnetic waves as a \"scientific idea that was as profound as any work of philosophy, as beautiful as any painting, and more powerful than any act of politics or war. Nothing would be the same again.\" A few years later, Maxwell came up with a theory of all electromagnetic phenomena, including light, that will remain for ever \"one of the finest of all man's scientific accomplishments\". But although everyone knows Marconi, few today have heard of the physicist whose theory inspired radio. Mahon rejects the idea that Maxwell was a \"coldly cerebral mathematical genius\", and instead describes a modest, witty man who wrote poetry and was passionate in his quest to understand the physical world. Perhaps, as a fellow scientist said, Maxwell is like one of those bright stars \"whose light takes ages to reach us\". <strong> PDS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Billy Ruffian, by David Corningly (Bloomsbury, \u00a38.99)</strong> </p> <p>Or Belly Rough One, properly the 74-gun Bellerophon, the \"bravest of the brave\" ship of the line. This is her biography, from the felling of 3,000 solitary oaks in southeast England in 1782 (not our American colonies? Did we have enough 100-year-old oaks to float a fleet?) to the 1836 auction of those by-then well-pickled timbers in Stonehouse, some bought by the former ship's surgeon to make picturesque his Gothick cottage. In the interim, she'd been the first to engage the enemy in the war against revolutionary France, garlanded in glory at Trafalgar (captain dead, first lieutenant awesomely heroic, prizes secured) and, the mythological role, had accepted Napoleon's surrender after Waterloo. She's most haunting as a dark prison hulk moored on the Medway - possibly as shivered over by Dickens at the start of Great Expectations - and a floating prison on the Tamar near Devonport, a way-station for convicts later transported to Australia.

  "<p><strong> From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women</strong> by Marilyn French<br> 3 vols, McArthur &amp; Company, \u00a316.99 each <br><strong> Women in England 1760-1914: A Social History </strong> by Susie Steinbach 320pp, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, <strong>\u00a325 </strong><br> </p> <p>Marilyn French set herself a vast task in deciding to produce this monumental history of women, and the decision itself is admirable. It has been argued many times that, as Jane Austen said nearly 200 years ago, \"Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story ... the pen has been in their hands.\" </p> <p>A vital part of the revolution forged by feminism in the past century was the attempt to change this - to open out the untold stories of women. To an extent, that has now happened; and all sorts of useful things, from women's studies courses to biographies of previously marginalised women and anthologies of forgotten women's poetry, have contributed to a change in the way historians assess the past. The call for \"herstory\", as this concentration on forgotten women was half-jokingly termed, seems much less revolutionary now. Look, for instance, at the new edition of the Dictionary of National Biography: one in 10 entries are about women, compared to one in 20 a century ago. </p> <p>But French feels that there is an untold story out there, and that there is still a pressing, political necessity to bring it to light. If you know her work you will be familiar with what she wants to show here. In her polemic Beyond Power she presented a potted history of the world, in which she argued that it moved from simple, matrilineal societies to complex, patriarchal ones, and that women had been oppressed in all places and all times since this shift took place. She also believes that feminism now presents the possibility that society can finally move beyond this universal oppression. But while Beyond Power was persuasive polemic, in these great tomes her argument is almost overwhelmed by the weight of material. </p> <p>The experience of reading these three books is frustrating, even if - perhaps particularly if - you admire what French is trying to do. I am absolutely at one with her view that we too often lose sight of the scale and depth of oppression that men have exercised over women throughout history, which means that we lose sight of the scale, unparalleled by any other social revolution, of what feminism has achieved and what it demands for the future. But, impressive as they are in range and ambition, I still found these books a problematic read. </p> <p>Above all this is because they are so undisciplined. What you get is not a narrative, but a great patchwork of stories, arguments and assertions. Apparently randomly chosen details about the fashion in medieval Japan for blackening teeth with oxidized iron filings, or the fact that in 13th-century Europe the font water used for christening \"was changed only when a baby defecated in it\", jostle with French's opinions about why wearing high heels now is like having your feet bound, or why feminism is inherently socialist. </p> <p>Given the lack of narrative shape and immense length - more than 1,700 pages all told - perhaps French wanted this work to be something of an encyclopaedia. Certainly the bibliographies will be a great source for researchers in the future. Still, although I am not the person to pick up errors in the sections on pre-colonial Africa or feudal Japan, I found myself arguing with her all too frequently when she moved closer to home. </p> <p>She states, for instance, that in 1913, \"as the king rode to the Derby, Emily Wilding Davison hurled herself in front of his horse crying 'Votes for Women'.\" In fact Davison ran on to the race course and was killed by a horse owned by the king, but being ridden by the jockey Herbert Jones. She states that in 18th-century America \"the law placed no restraints on men's cruelty. Wife-beating was legal if a man used a switch no thicker than his thumb ('the rule of thumb').\" But other historians have shown that there were laws at that time in north America that prohibited violence against wives. The phrase \"rule of thumb\" is generally held now to derive from the practice of judging a measurement with your thumb rather than a ruler. </p> <p>And if you wanted this to be a comprehensive encyclopedia, you would also look for more understandable decisions on what was included and what was not: why does the volume on the modern world offer 16 pages on Algeria - but only nine lines on Iran and only four negligible mentions of Afghanistan? Why do the indexes yield 11 mentions for Mary Wollstonecraft but not one for Virginia Woolf? Why is there no index at all for the first volume? </p> <p>When I started reading French's work, I had recently finished a book that works with similar material on a far smaller canvas and in a far less polemical way: Susie Steinbach's Women in England 1760 to 1914 . Steinbach has a quiet, unassuming style that can drift towards dullness, but her achievement is to show the gains of feminism not by assertion, but by the gradual build-up of evidence. She gives the reader a nuanced understanding of how women's convictions about their rights changed their lives in that period, against all the odds. After reading these books, I felt glad that both had been written and yet longed for something more from each. </p> <p>Yet for all its frustrating qualities, French's work is stuffed with enough nuggets to keep you wondering and pondering. She draws on a vast body of research and help from consultants in all sorts of fields, to open out areas that are rarely accessible. She tells you of heroines who have never had their due, from Queen Nzinga of 17th-century Angola, who freed slaves, tried to defeat the Portuguese imperialists, and who kept a harem of young men; to Kanno Suga, the turn-of-the-century Japanese anarchist who planned to assassinate the emperor. She emphasises the tradition of women's resistance in the past two centuries, from the female reform societies that published the names of men who visited brothels in 1834, to the women who crowded out the House Un-American Activities Committee in protest against the arms race in 1962. </p> <p>Above all, she recalls the depth and breadth of the war that has been waged on women down the centuries, the restrictions placed in so many times and so many places on their sexuality, their education, their freedom to travel, their voices. And although French's most effective piece of feminist polemic was her 1977 novel, The Women's Room, which defined a previous generation's dreams and fears about feminism, she hasn't lost hope, but remains passionately engaged with a dream for the future. </p> <p>In her last chapters, she puts the emphasis on how feminism is building international solidarity, by drawing us through the arguments and achievements of gatherings such as the Earth Summit of 1992 or the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993. Although she does not seem over-optimistic about the power of these bloated meetings to change the course of history, this emphasis is the right one. The development and spread of a new moral ideology centring on human rights is feeding the growth of a pragmatic feminism today. This feminism crosses cultures and national boundaries; it is flexible enough to take on different colours in different places without losing its irreducible commitment to women's rights as human rights. This growing international solidarity is what gives us hope for the future; a hope, against the odds, that the global oppression of women may be on the wane.</p>",
  "<p>Jenson Button will know by Monday whether he is free to drive for the BMW Williams team next season or whether he remains contractually committed to BAR-Honda - the team for whom he has raced to third place in this year's world championship. </p> <p>Today, in a Milan hotel, the three independent lawyers who make up the FIA contracts recognition board will hear lengthy submissions from counsel representing the two formula one teams, who both believe they have binding contracts with the 24-year-old British driver. </p> <p>The lawyers will have to consider the evidence and write up their judgment, so an official announcement of the outcome is not realistically expected until next week. Both sides remain confident. </p> <p>\"We are not considering our options for replacing Jenson,\" said David Richards, the BAR team principal, \"because we don't believe we will have to.\" </p> <p>A Williams spokesman said: \"We are going to the hearing in a confident mood and will abide by the board's decision. I don't think we would seek to take the matter further if the result was not in our favour.\" </p> <p>Yet the reality of the situation is that the arguments are finely balanced and may depend on whether the emphasis of interpretation of the way Button's contracts are written inclines towards European law rather than English law. </p> <p>\"In English law, adhering to the terms of a contract or an option is a very specific issue,\" a formula one insider said. \"European law in these cases pays much more regard to what the intention of the agreement was.\" </p> <p>The former interpretation would favour the Williams case, the latter BAR's. </p> <p>The breach between Button and the BAR team came after he finished second in the German grand prix in July, when his manager, John Byfield, sent a fax to Richards advising him that the driver would be switching to Williams for the 2005 season. </p> <p>Byfield claimed that Honda's failure to give BAR the necessary assurances in the manner specified over the issue of continued engine-supply arrangements to the team gave Button a legitimate escape route. </p> <p>But it is believed that the reason he was originally annoyed enough to seek a way of leaving the team stemmed from a disagreement over points-related bonus payments of about $1.8m (\u00a31m) after a change in FIA rules from the start of 2003 awarded points for the first eight grand prix finishing positions rather than the top six as had been the case. </p> <p>Resolving this is a matter of urgency not only for Button but also for other leading drivers who are lining themselves up for whichever of these two plum drives falls vacant. </p> <p>David Coulthard, who had signed a two-year contract to join Jaguar just before Ford took the decision to close the team last month, is one such hopeful. \"I hope Brazil [the season finale in Sao Paulo] won't be my last grand prix,\" the Scot said in Japan last week, \"because I don't feel ready to retire. I've still got the speed and motivation.\" </p> <p>Anthony Davidson, BAR's third driver this season, hopes to profit should Button leave the team, and Nick Heidfeld is hoping that a possible vacancy at Williams as a test driver might translate into a race seat if Button's planned move fails to materialise. Antonio Pizzonia, currently on the Williams test team, is also keeping his fingers crossed. </p> <p>\"This is a big moment for Jenson,\" said Ian Phillips, the Jordan team's commercial director. \"If you want to win races and world championships in this business, then you need to go with people who know how to do it. And Williams know how to do it. Sure, BAR has been promising this year, but they've yet to win a race, let alone a championship, so you can see things from Jenson's point of view. </p> <p>\"I mean, Jordan and Renault have won races but they haven't managed to string things together to win a championship. Williams have.\" </p> <p>Niki Lauda, the three-times world champion, agrees that the adjudication is crucial for Button's career but thinks it is almost impossible to judge which team will be better in 2005. \"On the face of it Williams and BAR are very closely matched,\" he said, \"but until we see their new cars for next year it will be difficult to see which will be the best for Jenson. Either way, it is crucial at this stage of his career that he ends up in the right place.\" </p> <p>The most telling observation came from the former Toyota formula one driver Allan McNish. \"It is obviously important for Jenson to feel comfortable with the team he is driving for,\" he said. \"But for me there would have to be a very good argument indeed if I was to move from BAR.\"</p>",
  "<p>Malcolm Glazer yesterday launched a stock-market raid on Manchester United, ordering his stockbrokers to buy up shares at 285p in an aggressive late-afternoon operation. </p> <p>The American tycoon succeeded in raising his stake from 19.2% to 25.5% in a move that was the clearest possible indication that he is still determined to buy United and wants to launch a full bid. </p> <p>The raid was also seen as a show of strength aimed at encouraging the Irishmen JP McManus and John Magnier, owners of the key 28.9% stake, to return to the negotiating table. </p> <p>It was also designed to kill the chances of a counter-proposal from Keith Harris, the chairman of the broker Seymour Pierce, who has been working on a scheme to make United immune from takeover. At over 25%, Glazer's stake is now so large that it could be used as a powerful block to other proposals. </p> <p>\"This demonstrates the Glazers' commitment to the club,\" said one of the family's advisers. \"They are long-term investors and they wanted parity with McManus and Magnier.\" </p> <p>Supporters' groups reacted with dismay to the prospect that Glazer's plans, which are expected to include hefty levels of debt, are still alive. Oliver Houston, a spokesman for Shareholders United said: \"We'll continue to fight tooth and nail to protect our club from Glazer. This latest development is yet another wake-up call but the battle is not over yet. He does not seem to realise that alienating a customer base does not make good business sense. </p> <p>\"We do not want him here and we won't rest on our laurels even if it means boycotting merchandise. The supporters do not want to spend their money on items such as club shirts to ease Glazer's debts.\" </p> <p>The market raid was launched after the long-term shareholder UBS, a Swiss bank, offered to sell its 8m shares to the Glazer camp at 285p. The offer was accepted and Glazer's advisers then instructed Credit Suisse First Boston to offer the same price to other market sellers and a further 7.8m shares were bought. It is thought Glazer was aiming to reach 29%. </p> <p>\"They have always been buyers when stock has been available,\" said one City source. \"In this case, when the Irish were saying they were walking away, liquidity was created allowing them [the Glazers] to pick up shares.\" </p> <p>United supporters will also be alarmed that the reasons for the breakdown in talks between the Glazers and McManus and Mangier on Thursday are more complicated than first appeared. </p> <p>It is now clear that the central sticking point was the proposed structure of Glazer's purchase of the Irish shares. </p> <p>It is understood the American wanted Cubic Expression, the Irishmen's investment vehicle, to give an irrevocable undertaking that it would accept an offer of 300p a share that would have been put to all shareholders. If Cubic had wanted to accept that price, it would still have run the risk that Glazer's bid could fail for other reasons - such as interference from regulators or politicians. </p> <p>Cubic is thought to have told JP Morgan that the only acceptable form in which it would consider offers for its stake would be a straightforward purchase of its shares. Under Stock Exchange rules, such a deal would trigger a mandatory bid for United's entire share capital - but, crucially, Cubic would be protected if the bid failed for other reasons. </p> <p>There is no reason to believe the Irish would have accepted 300p had it been offered in an acceptable form - the talks never got that far. Equally, however, they have not formally ruled out selling to Glazer at the right price and under the right structure. \"They are business people,\" said one source. </p> <p>Glazer's advisers will now seek to re-open talks with the Irish, although one admitted that breaking the deadlock would be hard. \"We are now really back to where we started,\" he said. </p> <p>Glazer's share-buying spree came only hours after United issued a statement saying it had held talks with the Glazer family but that \"there is currently no definitive proposal for the board to consider.\" </p> <p>The directors gave a clear hint to fans that it would consider the level of debt in any Glazer bid before giving a recommendation. </p> <p>\"The board can assure shareholders in the company and fans of the club that, should any proposal be made in the future, the board will take into account all relevant considerations ... and any impact these considerations may have on the future operation of the football club,\" it said. </p> <p><strong>The battleground</strong></p> <p><strong>Questions and answers</strong></p> <p><strong>What has changed?</strong><br> Yesterday's dramatic events do not change the big picture: Manchester United is still a quoted Stock Exchange company run by an independent board of directors. Glazer's stake has risen to 25.5% but, while it remains under 29%, he is under no obligation to launch a full bid. If he were to do so, though, he would have to offer at least 285p a share, the price he paid yesterday.</p> <p><strong>Can Glazer get control without the Irish stake?</strong><br> Technically, yes; in practice, no. JP McManus and John Magnier's stake is 28.9% and Glazer's ambition is full ownership. To take the company properly private, he will need to get to 75% or, better, 90%.</p> <p><strong>Why didn't the Irish sell to the Glazer?</strong><br> The Irish broke off talks because of the way Glazer structured his offer. The Irish said they are long-term investors in United and have lived up to that promise. They are also businessmen - if somebody offers them a silly price, don't be surprised if they sell.</p> <p><strong>So what happens now?</strong><br> The ball is in Glazer's court. He could sit tight and wage a war of attrition. More likely, he will try again to coax the Irish into selling their shares.</p> <p><strong>Could anybody else bid?</strong><br> Unlikely - the price is now getting seriously high. But don't rule out anything.</p> <p><strong>How long could this go on?</strong><br> Impossible to guess.</p>",
  "<p>Last week I went to the annual huddle of the Alliance of Independent Press Councils of Europe (AIPCE) to speak about the still fairly rare form of self-regulation that we try to practise at the Guardian. I was invited by the hosts, the Cyprus Media Complaints Commission, and we met in the divided city of Nicosia. </p> <p>Unless you are involved in the self-regulation of the press you are unlikely to have heard of the AIPCE, a useful and, deliberately, fairly informal association of self-regulation bodies that began meeting about six years ago at the joint suggestion of the British Press Complaints Commission and its counterpart in the Netherlands. </p> <p>In the relatively short period that it has been in existence, it has become a major forum for exchanging ideas, sharing experience, and in particular, most recently, for the support and encouragement of the press councils that are emerging in eastern Europe - in the former Soviet Union, in former Yugoslavia, and in countries such as Bulgaria. Half of the independent press councils in the world have been formed since 1990, and a third since 2000. The growth among members of the European alliance reflects that pattern. </p> <p>The new European members have found among their colleagues in the older established bodies - such as the PCC in Britain - a ready response to requests for help and advice. The PCC has, in fact, provided consultative services since not long after its foundation in 1991. An assistant director, William Gore, coordinates its work overseas. He says: \"It is important for us to get involved when and where we are wanted, if our help is sought.\" The director of the PCC, Tim Toulmin, is keen on this work, like his predecessor, Guy Black. </p> <p>The PCC has had a direct involvement in, for example, the establishment of a press council in Bosnia-Herzogovina where it went, initially, at the invitation of a European commission agency there. The former acting chairman of the PCC, Professor Robert Pinker, having gone there as a consultant, became the first international chairman of the Bosnian press council, a post to which he expects a Bosnian to be elected in May next year. </p> <p>Prof Pinker told me, \"The Bosnian press council could not have started under more difficult circumstances. Now it is fair to call it one of the truly national bodies. We are in the process of extending the range of members to make it even more representative.\" </p> <p>The PCC has also been quick to put its experience, on request, at the disposal of projects initiated by others. I have personal experience of one of these, a programme to establish press and media councils in two pilot schemes in Russia, one in Nizhny Novgorod, to the east of Moscow, and the other in the south at Rostov-on-Don. I visited both places with PPC representatives when the project was just beginning. </p> <p>The guiding hand has been provided by the Programme in Comparative Media Law and Policy at Oxford University. It has worked with the Moscow Media Law and Policy Institute and local people over the past three years and - as the Russian delegates reported at the Cyprus conference - the scheme is now showing positive signs of success. I hope to report on that more fully later this year. </p> <p>The problems faced by the media in this and other areas represented at the conference are daunting. There is something chastening to see the dedication and courage being brought to the task of trying to develop and protect a press free from state interference and corruption.

  "<p>The recent launch of a download chart sanctioned by the major record labels was final confirmation that the music industry had woken up to the commercial potential of the digital age. </p> <p>Yet while the way consumers buy music has been dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st-century, the way record companies go about finding their stable of bands and artists remains as comfortingly traditional as ever. </p> <p>The responsibility for unearthing a hit-making band, signing them up and ensuring they produce the goods, rests with A&amp;R men (and they usually are men). It is upon these shoulders that rests the commercial and creative success of their employers. </p> <p>The traditional image of talent scouts scouring pubs and clubs to find The Next Big Thing still holds true, but there is a lot more to being in A&amp;R - the letters stand for artists and repertoire - than hanging out in dodgy boozers on a rainy Monday night in the hope of finding the new Strokes or White Stripes. </p> <p>\"There are two elements to being an A&amp;R person,\" says 31-year-old Nick Burgess, A&amp;R manager at Virgin Records and the man responsible for discovering Irish rockers The Thrills. </p> <p>\"First you get out there and hopefully happen upon a band you are passionate about, or at least think the public will be passionate about, and then you present them with the best case for signing with your own company, often in the face of very heavy competition. </p> <p>\"The second element is that once you've signed the band, you are able to listen to the music and understand the creative process. It's crucial to be able to understand how a song written in a guy's bedroom can go from that stage to being recorded, mixed, mastered and then put out as a record.\" </p> <p>The latter role carries a lot of responsibility, both for the band and the A&amp;R person, since a lot of money is often riding on the outcome. Mr Burgess went to Dublin to listen to the new material for The Thrills' new album, Let's Bottle Bohemia, way ahead of its release, in order to perform a kind of quality assessment. </p> <p>\"They played me pretty much the whole record and I made suggestions as to what track should be left off and be a b-side, or whether a verse needed to be tightened up. Some bands don't accept that. That's when the trust comes in. I know I've got a constructive relationship with the band.\" </p> <p>While he has to ensure the creative process is as good as it can be, he also has a responsibility to the band's paymasters, the record label. </p> <p>\"At the end of the day, my job is to deliver the best record I can,\" Mr Burgess adds. \"I have to go through all kinds of arguments with the band, the manager, and the producer, to get that. I'm a kind of quality control manager, and I'm as culpable as the band when the record isn't good enough.\" </p> <p>Such a potentially powerful role demands considerable interpersonal skills, since much of the job revolves around liaising between band and record company. </p> <p>\"One of the keys to A&amp;R is the relationship with your artist,\" says Max Lousada, head of A&amp;R at Atlantic UK. \"Trust is built by good communication and a track record.\" </p> <p>Mr Lousada, who in his time has signed The Darkness, Funeral For A Friend, Zero 7 and Goldie Lookin' Chain, says how he works with an act varies with each band. </p> <p>\"I give all my bands creative control and that means I have to be convinced that any ideas that we come up with are right for the band. No artist is a sheep, and they need to be treated on an individual basis. The challenge is to find a band or an artist who have their own individuality and a sense of themselves and work with them.\" </p> <p>Chris Briggs, veteran group A&amp;R executive at EMI, who over the years has signed bands as diverse as the Gang Of Four and ABC and more recently has steered Robbie Williams' recording career, firmly believes in a less is more philosophy. </p> <p>\"You find out who your artist is, figure out what he or she knows and what they don't know or want to learn and introduce them to people who can work with them. If somebody's really good at what they do there's not very much that needs fixing. You just try to introduce things that give it a bit more.\" </p> <p>It's also a sector of the industry that attracts people with a wide range of talents, says Mr Briggs. \"Lots of people who are A&amp;R do different things. Some people are talent scouts who couldn't put a CD into a CD player but have fantastic instincts at spotting talent really early.\" Others, he adds, like himself, are \"much better at helping with the recording process, in some abstract way.\" </p> <p>New technologies will have little impact on A&amp;R, believes Muff Winwood, brother of Steve, and, until he retired at the beginning of this year, the head of A&amp;R at Sony Music UK. \"You still have to make the decision as to whether you think the band is good and whether the music is right for the time or the near future. </p> <p>\"Where things have changed is that people have much greater access to bands now, thanks to the internet, email and an explosion of coverage on TV. The knock-on effect of that is that people can maybe tire of a group sooner than they might have done 20 or 30 years ago.\" </p> <p>With such decision-making goes responsibility and many describe working in an A&amp;R department of a record company as the frontline of the music industry, a position that requires considerable self-belief. </p> <p>\"You need that plus; the confidence that you might fuck up, but also the knowledge that you have to go with your gut feeling, together with the band's vision,\" says Mr Lousada. \"I'm investing in the development of a band and that's exciting, because I don't know where it's going to lead.\" </p> <p><strong>Case study</strong></p> <p><strong>Loving music isn't enough</strong></p> <p> Nick Burgess, A&amp;R manager at Virgin Records UK, had a crack at fame in the late 90s in a band called Glue Bound, but realised his interest in the strategic side of the business outweighed his ambition as a guitarist. </p> <p>\"I came down to London in 1998 and got a week's work experience at Gut Records. I was offered a three-month trial and two and a half years later I was head of A&amp;R there. Then in April 2002, Virgin Records boss Philippe Ascoli phoned me out of the blue and offered me a gig there. </p> <p>\"Getting out and about and meeting people is the best way to find out about a new band. Very rarely will anyone get signed by sending a demo in to a record company.\" </p> <p>A&amp;R, says Mr Burgess, is a skilled job. \"It gets a bad reputation, sometimes deservedly so, since some people are employed for the wrong reasons. Getting a job in A&amp;R is a lottery. It's usually about being in the right place, or knowing someone who can help you. </p> <p>\"There's a lot more to it than just standing by the bar of some pub and criticising a band then going off and getting legless. </p> <p>\"It's a people business; being in a band meant that I know what bands want. You have to get on with people and know what you're doing and have an understanding for music. Loving music isn't enough, really.\"</p>",
  "In 1975 Dame Rosemary Murray, who has died aged 91, became the first woman vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, a post she held until 1977. And exactly 50 years ago this month she founded New Hall, the first new college in Cambridge for more than 80 years, as a college for women. <p>She was its tutor-in-charge from 1954 to 1964 and its founder-president from 1964 to 1981. During her Cambridge career she combined determination in the battle for equal status and opportunity for female students, with a strong sense of public service.</p> <p>Murray was surprised to be chosen to head New Hall, but in April 1954 the college was incorporated as a limited company, and she set to, with Robin Hammond, to get buildings and furniture together for its first 16 undergraduates by October that year. No wealthy founder had come forward with an endowment but she went ahead regardless. The reward for an eventual benefactor would be to choose the college name; meanwhile, she insisted, New Hall was just a temporary expedient.</p> <p>The college began its life in Silver Street - where Darwin College stands today - while she campaigned for 10 years to fund permanent buildings in Huntingdon Road. Their dramatic architecture, listed Grade 2* in 1992, still astonishes, but in her time, and still, thanks to her legacy, her college remains an unstuffy place. It was thanks to her political acumen that New Hall reached full collegiate status by 1972, despite never receiving that endowment.</p> <p>Murray was highly regarded as a university politician, which was why, two years after becoming eligible, she was elected to be the first and, until the election of Alison Richard in 2002, the only woman vice-chancellor of Cambridge (or Oxford). With typical ingenuity she devised a female version of the cassock, the traditional garb of a vice-chancellor - and last year passed on the pattern to Professor Richard. The first vice-chancellor from a 20th century college, and the first to move into the central university offices, she was said to have created her office from a corridor, bringing in her own tools and installing the locks.</p> <p>As vice-chancellor, she faced a time of inflation, declining purchasing power, pay restraint and industrial and social unrest; major building projects were almost impossible. She supported four colleges, Wolfson, Darwin, Robinson and Homerton, each at a critical stage of development; she inaugurated the clinical med- audiovisual aids unit; founded the Cambridge Society; introduced student members on university committees (New Hall being the first college in which students served on council) and built the new music school and West Road concert hall with the support of the American Friends of Cambridge University.</p> <p>Murray was the eldest of six children. Her father was an admiral; her maternal grandfather was the Oxford academic Dr Spooner. She was educated at Downe House school, Newbury, and read chemistry - and took her DPhil - at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. She taught chemistry at London University's Royal Holloway College, from 1938 to 1941 and then at Sheffield University until 1942.</p> <p>Enlisting as a rating in the Women's Royal Navy Service she rose to become a chief officer. She was then a demonstrator in chemistry at Cambridge from 1947 until 1952 and a fellow of Girton College from 1946 to 1954.</p> <p>Until 1948, Cambridge women did not receive full degree status. The barrier was symbolically lifted when Queen Elizabeth received an honorary doctorate of law, but women's numbers were still limited to one fifth that of male students. Murray took an active part in the work of the Third Foundation for Women, an association created to improve women's opportunities. From this, her new college was born.</p> <p>With her strong sense of community, Murray spent 30 years as a JP and became the first woman deputy-lieutenant of Cambridgeshire, parading in her WRNS uniform.</p> <p>She was also a member of the Wages Council and the Armed Services Pay Review Body. Among other directorships, she was on the board of the Observer from 1981 until 1993. She received honorary degrees from British and American universities.</p> <p>In late retirement she helped children at her local middle school with reading practice. Asked by a friend what the children called her, she replied in surprise, \"Rosemary, of course!\"</p> <p>A notable plantswoman, she could turn her hand to anything, fostered by her father's early lessons in carpentry, and had a passion for small boats. She pressed fellows to join her as she weeded the gardens, and her carpentry and plumbing DIY skills were legendary.</p> <p>Almost Murray's last outing was to Chelsea Flower Show in June for the launch of the pale yellow rose that bears her name. Someone who worked with her wrote: \"She had the enviable quality of actually liking people.\" She took it for granted that women could and should work on equal terms with men, and never sought special treatment for herself or her college.</p> <p>To her, hard work was a pleasure, and no task too humble if it contributed to the general good. This message was the more persuasive because of her infectious delight in the world around her.</p> <p> <b>\u00b7 </b>Dame (Alice) Rosemary Murray, university teacher and administrator, born July 28 1913; died October 8 2004</p>",
  "A convicted rapist who forced his girlfriend and her two children on a 100mph car chase before shooting a grandfather in the face was found guilty of murder yesterday. <p>Richard Watson, 35, was armed with a sawn-off shotgun when he chased Amratlal Kanabar, 60, of Wigston, Leicester, and his friends from a Nottingham casino, intent on robbing them.</p> <p>Rebecca Shakespeare, 25, was cleared of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter at Nottingham crown court.</p> <p>She told the jury that she lied to police to protect Watson because she was terrified of him.</p> <p>The pair were found guilty of plotting to commit robbery and of possessing a firearm after DNA from each of them was discovered on a weapon found at her home in Top Valley, Nottingham.</p> <p>The court was told Watson, who had a history of violence against women and was on licence for rape, forced his girlfriend and her two daughters, aged five and three, into going with him to the Gala Casino.</p> <p>Driving her car, he followed four men as they drove away from the casino. He flashed the headlights to persuade them to pull over but when they refused, the 100mph chase began.</p> <p>Shakespeare said Watson forced her to wind down the passenger window before reaching across to shoot Mr Kanabar. He died in hospital.</p> <p>Mr Justice Evans adjourned the case for sentencing today.</p>",
  "A car bomb exploded near an Iraqi police patrol in southern Baghdad today, killing ten people and wounding four others, the US military said. <p>The military said a car packed with 135kg of explosives blew up at about 11am local time (0900 BST) as an Iraqi police patrol drove through the al-Dora neighbourhood. The blast killed a family of four travelling in a car nearby, four Iraqi labourers working in a palm grove, and two other bystanders, the military said. </p> <p>\"This is an act of terrorists,\" said Lt Col James Hutton, a spokesman for the 1st Cavalry Division. \"These attacks kill innocent Iraqi people trying to live their lives in peace.\" </p> <p>Associated Press television footage showed two destroyed police vehicles, a crater caused by the explosion, and a charred engine believed to be that of the exploded car. Earlier reports had suggested only one person died in the blast. </p> <p>Elsewhere in Iraq, a British security guard was shot dead in the northern city of Kirkuk, the foreign office said. The man has not yet been named, but he worked for ArmorGroup, a security firm based in London.</p> <p>The news came as US forces continued a wave of air and ground assaults on the rebel-held city of Falluja after local officials broke off peace talks and said US and Iraqi authorities were making impossible demands. </p> <p>Early this morning, air strikes were launched against sites that US military officials said were being used as planning centres for terrorist operations by senior associates of Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. </p> <p>Earlier this week, the interim Iraqi prime minister, Ayad Allawi, demanded that local officials hand over Zarqawi in order to prevent strikes on the city. However, officials in Falluja suspended peace talks yesterday, saying they could not be expected to locate and hand over a man who even well-armed US forces had been unable to find.</p> <p>Iraqi police and witnesses reported that US troops arrested the city's chief negotiator today, Khaled al-Jumaili, and its police chief, Sabar al-Janabi. Two other police officers were also detained. US military officials claim Falluja is the base of operations for Zarqawi's Tawhid and Jihad group, which claimed responsibility for the kidnap and murder of British engineer Ken Bigley. </p> <p>Overnight, warplanes and artillery pounded the city, which is 65km (40 miles) west of Baghdad, as two US marine battalions attacked rebel positions to \"restore security and stability\", First Lieutenant Lyle Gilbert, a spokesman for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, told CNN. </p> <p>Three people were killed and seven others injured during the night, according to Dr Rafi'a Hiyad of Falluja general hospital. Yesterday, hospital staff said at least five people had been killed and 16 wounded. </p> <p>Operations against Sunni insurgent areas have been stepped up in recent weeks prior to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins today. Last year, Ramadan was accompanied by a wave of violence. </p> <p>\"The operations were designed to target the large terrorist element operating in the area of Falluja,\" the US command said. \"This element has been planning to use the holy month of Ramadan for attacks.\"</p> <p>The US military claimed it had destroyed several key planning centres, a weapons storage facility, two safehouses, a terrorist meeting site and several illegal checkpoints used by Zarqawi's network. </p> <p>Tawhid and Jihad, which the US believes is based in the city, claimed responsibility for yesterday's twin suicide bombings inside Baghdad's heavily fortified green zone. At least six people, including four US security contractors, were killed in the attacks. </p> <p>Negotiations had been aimed at restoring government control to Falluja, which fell under the control of clerics and their armed followers after the end of a three-week US siege in April. </p> <p>\"Since we exhausted all peaceful solutions, the city is now ready to bear arms and defend its religion and honour and it is not afraid of Allawi's statements,\" Abu Asaad, spokesman for the mujahideen council of Falluja told al-Jazeera television.</p>",

  "<p>After seeing Microsoft's announcements earlier this week about its brand building efforts for digital media and home entertainment, I was interested in what this meant for the future of technology. We're all well aware of Microsoft's capability for taking over a market, and in terms of leisure spend - both time and money - there is probably nothing bigger than getting control of the living room.</p> <p>Imagine if one company can get into your living room, and help control your television, video, audio and computing systems. Imagine the direct power they would have; imagine the control they could exercise over the broad span of culture and leisure activities.</p> <p>In the PC market, Microsoft have managed to become massively successful by knocking out both the hardware manufacturers and the software providers out of the equation. In the home entertainment market, however, they are likely to have serious competition from those content producers (including broadcasters, music labels, etc) and hardware manufacturers (TV sets, VCRs, digital cameras etc) who might well be classed as MS \"allies\" at the moment, but aren't prepared to give up their slice of the home entertainment pie.</p> <p>So what will be the key battlegrounds in the war for control of the home?</p> <p><strong>Security:</strong> To say that security has never been MS's strong suit is an understatement: but if computing hooks up to home entertainment, take whatever problems afflict your home computer and then multiply them tenfold. Microsoft - and anyone else making a play for the home market - has to prove that they can protect you better than they do now. After all: imagine your kids are watching and then some porn spam manages to broadcast straight down your tube. That's not going to be a nice feeling.</p> <p><strong>Stability:</strong> When I stretch my PC too much, it gives me the blue screen of death. When I'm in full flow on my Mac, it can't handle the load. People accept this problem with computing, but they're not likely to be so forgiving. Imagine if your TV crashed and took two minutes to reboot. It's not something people are going to be happy with.</p> <p><strong>Trust:</strong> Unlike home computing, Microsoft isn't going into an infant market with home entertainment; there are already a large number of trusted providers in both content and hardware. Whoever takes control of the market will need to recognise that. For example, some people already have incredible brand loyalty to the likes of Sony. So what happens if Sony decide to take on Microsoft? A battle that's far bigger than anything Bill Gates has come across before, that's what.</p> <p>It's going to be a fascinating battle; watch this space.</p>",
  "<p>Most mobile phone owners will at some point have received a rogue text: an SMS message intended to dupe the recipient into calling an expensive premium rate number to claim prizes which often do not exist, or are not what they seem.</p> <p>Frequently, these messages promise some generic object of desire such as a free holiday, a cash reward or a new relationship. People calling the numbers provided (which usually begin with the digits 090) can be charged up to \u00a31.50 a minute, and are often to be left hanging on for some time before either giving up or \"winning\" a prize that is either virtually worthless or requires some sort of hidden outlay. </p> <p>Another common scam is repeatedly to send unwanted ringtones, charged at up to \u00a31.50 a time, and often sent when the owner has not knowingly subscribed to the service.</p> <p>People fall for text scams for a number of reasons. They instinctively feel their mobile number is private. They also know that, unlike email, it costs money to send a text message. This false sense of intimacy often leads people to believe they are the text's sole recipient, lulling them into a false sense of trust. </p> <p>In August 2004 ICSTIS, the independent watchdog responsible for policing companies operating premium-rate services, fined the Kuala Lumpur-based firm Vertical Media for operating a text scam encouraging people to call a national number to retrieve a voicemail message. Callers were informed they had won a \u00a35,000 prize and were instructed to call a premium-rate number in order to make a claim.</p> <p>The \"prize\" turned out to be holiday discount vouchers, which callers had to text yet another number to claim. The texts were often rejected, rendering the claim incomplete. This sort of ploy is fairly common, as is the type that offers flight vouchers containing a clause requiring travellers to pay for expensive accommodation on arrival.</p> <p>ICSTIS can take action against rogue companies, closing down scams by blocking 090 numbers. But as quickly as one 090 number is blocked, the scammers move to another. In the case of Vertical Media, ICSTIS levied a \u00a375,000 fine. But its overall powers are limited, and it remains to be seen whether Vertical Media will pay.</p> <p>Adrian Harris, the founder of <a href=\"http://grumbletext.co.uk\">Grumbletext</a>, a website set up to collate information and warn people about misleading and expensive text messages, says the fines are not a worthwhile deterrent.</p> <p>His view is backed up by Sir George Young MP who told the House of Commons in June that it appeared 70% of fines issued by ISCTIS, for text scams and rogue internet diallers - scammers who surreptitiously divert personal internet dial-ups to premium rate lines - went unpaid. Often the companies concerned are overseas or in liquidation.</p> <p>For its part, ICSTIC says the number of fines unpaid was nearer 60% in 2003. Spokeswoman Catherine Bell says: \"So far for 2004 we have collected 55% of the fines and are still collecting money. We are working very hard with the networks and service providers to insure these fines are collected and the sanctions imposed are upheld. We have implemented several measures, including employing a financial manager, to improve on last year's figures.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, frustrated by what Harris sees as a toothless and ineffective regulatory body, Grumbletext has taken matters in its own hands, displaying rogue texts forwarded by users, and warning others not to respond. But how do you get rid of these messages once they have started?</p> <p>Harris says: \"In theory, there is now a universal unsubscribe command: you text the word STOP back to the service which is charging you. However, when this doesn't work, Grumbletext has directed consumers to complain to ICSTIS, the premium rate regulator. But experience has now shown that this appears to be of little benefit to consumers.\"</p> <p>Grumbletext now advises aggrieved recipients to contact their mobile phone providers directly. Harris even suggests that mobile companies may be responsible in law for unsolicited texts. If no opt-in message for subscription services has been sent to the premium rate provider, unrequested text messages are illegal. And, as mobile companies receive a proportion of the money raised by these messages, they may be in part responsible.</p> <p>\"Even where the services such as ringtones have technically been subscribed to, there will be a number of arguments which consumers can use - along the lines of commercial abuse, unfair terms and conditions, and misrepresentation,\" says Harris.</p> <p>\"The operators are potentially at risk of being held liable, even though in many instances they themselves were not the promoters and operators of these services.\"</p> <p>ICSTIS deputy director Paul Whiteing points out the number of complaints is down on last year, after mobile operators started to take action against firms running scams from overseas. A new law introduced in December made sending unsolicited text messages illegal, while new data telephony privacy regulations mean people now have to opt-in to receiving charged-for messages.</p> <p>Whiteing says: \"Most companies send messages randomly or get numbers from list brokers. Children or older people are particularly vulnerable - kids don't realise these offers are a rip off as they don't understand how these things work.\"</p> <p>Mobile phone company O2 suggests that mobile uses register their telephone number with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS). It's illegal to make a direct marketing call or to send marketing SMS to any number after 28 days from the time it is registered with the TPS. You can register by calling 0845 070 0707 or at <a href=\"http://www.tps-online.org.uk\"> www.tps-online.org.uk</a>. </p> <p>But as scammers find ever more inventive ways to prey on the vulnerability and credulity of phone users, it probably pays to remember the old maxim: if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For more information visit <a href=\"http://www.grumbletext.co.uk\"> www.grumbletext.co.uk</a>.

  "<p>Three former NatWest bankers should be extradited to the US to face trial over Enron-related fraud charges, a judge ruled today.</p> <p>The three - Gary Mulgrew, Giles Darby and David Bermingham - have each been accused of seven counts of \"wire fraud\" by US authorities. They all worked for Greenwich Natwest, the bank's capital markets division, at the time of the alleged fraud four years ago.</p> <p>The Britons have been fighting extradition over allegations that they conspired with Enron executives, including the former finance chief, Andrew Fastow, to defraud NatWest by secretly investing in an off balance sheet deal. </p> <p>It is alleged they made \u00a31.5m each after cheaply selling an interest held by Greenwich NatWest in an Enron entity, and pocketing the difference. </p> <p>US authorities, who want the men to face trial in Houston, Texas, have based their case on evidence given to the UK's Financial Services Authority. The three each face up to 35 years in prison.</p> <p>None of the men - who all deny the allegations - has been charged in the UK. After the hearing, Mr Bermingham said they planned to appeal to the high court and had 14 days to do so. </p> <p>Should they fail to overturn the ruling, the final decision over extradition rests with the home secretary, David Blunkett. Mr Blunkett will be sent a recommendation from Judge Nicholas Evans, who issued today's ruling at Bow Street magistrates court.</p> <p>\"There is a good and proper basis for prosecuting them in the US,\" the judge said, adding that the process of extradition was necessary in a democratic society. He said he did not consider that it breached the three men's human rights.</p> <p>His order was made under new legislation - in force since January - designed to speed up the extradition of suspected terrorists. </p> <p>The former bankers argue they would have to pay their own legal costs of up to $2m (\u00a31.1m), and would probably not be granted bail. They have been told they face up to two years in a federal penitentiary before their case comes to court. During the Bow Street hearing, they argued they should face trial in the UK. Speaking outside the court, Mr Bermingham said: \"To do that would take one phone call to the Serious Fraud Office or the Crown Prosecution Service, and they could bring upon us the might of the UK legal system. We repeat that request to the US government ... bring the action here, where it belongs.\" </p> <p>Judge Evans had heard from a US federal criminal defence attorney, called on behalf of the former bankers, who said the men \"would not get a fair trial in Texas\". </p> <p>Douglas McNabb told the court they would not be able to get documents to prepare for trial if they were behind bars, and would be denied access to computers.</p> <p>He also described the US federal justice system as \"incredibly unfair\", pointing out that 97% of people pleaded guilty to federal offences, arguing: \"In most cases they would be mad not to after looking at the sentencing guidelines.\"</p>",
  "The Carlyle Group, a large investment firm linked to US and British politicians, has pulled out of a scheme to recover billions of dollars from Iraq, following the publication in the Guardian this week of documents detailing the secret proposals of a consortium with which it was involved. <p>Carlyle published a withdrawal letter yesterday sent to other members of its consortium. </p> <p>The consortium offered a confidential deal to use its political influence to collect a $27bn (\u00a315bn) debt owed by Iraq to Kuwait, despite US pleas for debt forgiveness from other countries. </p> <p>A Carlyle partner, former US secretary of state James Baker, has been accused of a conflict of interest, because he has been touring the world demanding debt relief on behalf of President Bush, while his firm had a private interest in doing a special deal with Kuwait. </p> <p>Carlyle's letter, signed by its general counsel Jeffrey R Ferguson and dated October 13, says: \"Carlyle does not want to participate in the consortium's work in any way, shape or form and will not invest any money raised by the consortium's efforts.\" </p> <p>The letter also claims that at the time Mr Baker was appointed the president's debt envoy that \"Mr Baker understood that Carlyle would have no involvement with the consortium\". </p> <p>Carlyle admits it was involved in the original scheme by a consortium of financiers and lobbyists, who lobbied Kuwait at a London meeting on July 16 2003. </p> <p>Documents from the consortium describe Carlyle's chairman, former US defence secretary Frank Carlucci, as the man who \"played a convening and guiding role on behalf of Carlyle\". </p> <p>They also specifically mention Mr Baker's name as one of the \"leading individuals associated with Carlyle\" who they claim will be free to play a \"decisive role\" once Mr Baker's retires from his \"temporary position\" as debt forgiveness envoy. </p> <p>The scheme had two parts. The first was to turn over Kuwait's $27bn war reparations debt to a foundation set up by the consortium, which would then use its political influence to ensure Iraq was made to pay up. </p> <p>The second part of the plan was to benefit Carlyle specifically, by handing over to them $1bn from Kuwait to manage in their investment funds. </p> <p>The documents suggest that Carlyle scaled back its stated involvement in the scheme while Mr Baker was in his official post, but Kuwait was informed by the consortium that this was only temporary. </p> <p>The cover letter to Kuwait with the detailed proposal confirming Carlyle's continuation as a participant was signed by another former secretary of state turned lobbyist, Madeleine Albright, by a Washington law firm, Coudert Bros, and by the consortium's leader, Shahameen Sheikh of the \"International Strategy Group\". </p> <p>In its second change of position in as many days, Carlyle claimed yesterday in its letter that \"Carlyle was never a member of the consortium\". The previous day, its spokesman claimed Carlyle \"withdrew\" from the consortium after Mr Baker became debt envoy last December. </p> <p>The day before that, its spokesman Chris Ullman told the Guardian, Carlyle had merely \"restricted\" its consortium role while Mr Baker was in office, but was still looking to receive a $1bn investment as part of the deal. </p> <p>Jamie Smith, spokeswoman for the Albright Group LLC, said the consortium had, as of yesterday, stopped pursuing business with Kuwait. \"The proposal is clearly dead,\" she said.</p>",
  "In asymmetrical warfare, like the conflict that is now pitting more than 200,000 foreign and Iraqi troops against 20,000 insurgents, it is an unfortunate fact that indiscriminate terrorism and hostage-taking are undoubtedly effective weapons. <p>President George Bush and the British prime minister, Tony Blair, have denounced the \"savagery\" and \"barbarity\" of such practices. The fact remains, argues Professor Anthony S Cordesman, a Republican historian who has written 20 books on war and terrorism, that car bombs, kidnappings and the desecration of enemy corpses are \"practices which have been used cyclically in all cases of asymmetrical warfare . . . for centuries, if not millennia\". </p> <p>Cordesman, who holds a chair on strategy at the prestigious Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, describes such bloodthirsty practices as \"useful atrocities\". \"Whatever you may think of them, they form part of the standard arsenal of war,\" he says. </p> <p>Thanks to the advent of satellite television and instantaneous media, such practices \"have simply become more attractive\", because they provide those who resort to them, and in particular small groups lacking clout or firepower, with a \"wide range of political and psychological tactics that go much further than their actual power\". </p> <p>Cordesman, who was once director of intelligence assessment in the office of the US defence secretary, said the American-led multinational forces in Iraq \"would be well-advised to realise\" that the mutilated body of a hostage or a prisoner \"is just as much a weapon as a grenade-launcher\". </p> <p>In Iraq the kidnapping of foreigners was not used as a weapon from the very start of the conflict. Hostage-taking began only six months ago, or exactly one year after the American and British invasion. At the end of March four armed American \"civil ians\" (in fact, mercenaries), who worked for one of the private security firms that are now proliferating in Iraq, were ambushed and killed by insurgents at the entrance to Falluja. </p> <p>Above all, the \"emirs\" of the anti-American uprising took on board a key element of psychological warfare that may have eluded them up to then: you don't need to kill enemy soldiers, who are anyway increasingly unassailable in their fortified strongholds, in order to wrong-foot them. All you have to do is raise the horror stakes: the first kidnapping of foreigners took place on April 9, during the siege of Falluja. </p> <p>That day, four American civilians who worked for KBR, a Halliburton construction subsidiary, were taken hostage and murdered along with two GIs, Keith Maupin and Elmer Krause. The following day a Danish businessman was kidnapped near Baghdad. He was found dead 48 hours later. On April 12 four Italians working for another private security firm were taken hostage. Three of them were released after payment of a ransom. The fourth, Fabrizio Quattrocchi, was decapitated. The scene was videotaped. </p> <p>Thanks to TV stations that broadcast all over the world, and to the internet, which cannot be censored, the Iraqi insurgents and foreign jihadists who had joined them took their cue from precedents in Asia, such as the filmed decapitation in Pakistan of Daniel Pearl in February 2002, which was the first of its kind in the post-9/11 period. They realised how great an impact they could have on world opinion, and therefore on all the governments in the coalition. </p> <p>Other victims were soon to follow: Nicholas Berg, an American engineer; Enzo Baldoni, an Italian journalist and pacifist; and Kim Sun-il, a South Korean interpreter, as well as Bulgarians, Lebanese, Turks, Britons, Pakistanis and Nepalese. </p> <p>In all, 36 of the total 150 hostages taken so far have been murdered by their kidnappers. At least an equivalent number are still being held. The festival of horror continues. </p> <p>Hostages' statements are recorded. Scenes of them having their throats slit or being decapitated are meticulously filmed. The resulting audio and video cassettes are sold under the counter in front of mosques and at every street market in Iraq. </p> <p>\"[The terrorists'] message is directed at several different audiences, and it works,\" notes Jonathan Mendilow, an Israeli-American academic who lectures on every aspect of terrorism at Rider University in New Jersey. First, by resorting to a method which continues to be used in Saudi Arabia - three drugs traffickers have just been beheaded there - they are faithful to a certain Islamic \"custom\". </p> <p>\"They bank on going back to the roots of the original Islam,\" says Diaa Rashwan, an Egyptian expert on terrorism at the Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo. \"They aim to assert their link with the past by using the theme 'We are fighting the same war as the Prophet and the earliest Muslims', when Islam was still in its infancy and its only weapon the sword.\" </p> <p>In these times of tension between the major religions such an image has a certain appeal. It impresses on young people and convinces their elders - particularly former soldiers - that the \"Islamic resistance movement\" is fearless, robust and determined. </p> <p>Finally, by calling to mind dark medieval images that transcend the act of murder, the terrorists strike terror into the enemy forces, their allies and their local henchmen. Several Iraqis who have collaborated with the occupying power have also been videotaped having their throats slit after confessing to their \"crimes\". </p> <p>Others have been released after paying their \"dues\" to the cause and promising, again in front of a camera, that they will stop collaborating, leave the country and encourage their fellow Iraqis not to cooperate with the US. </p> <p>The strategy of chaos, terror and hostage-taking began to pay off. It had at least two objectives. First, to ensure that no major reconstruction or national stabilisation was achieved in Iraq just as long as the country was under military occupation or governed by an interim regime chosen, promoted and protected by Washington. </p> <p>In that respect, the insurgents have been almost totally successful. Out of the $18.4bn allocated by the US Congress in 2003 for the reconstruction of Iraq, barely $1bn has been spent, and at least half that sum has gone towards equipping thesecurity forces. Why? Because there has been a wholesale breakdown of law and order. </p> <p>The reconstruction of Iraq, which in the minds of those who planned it was supposed to speed up the process of normalisation, has never really got off the ground. The insurgents have made sure of that. </p> <p>Their second objective was to isolate their main enemy, the US. Here again, the rebels have made headway. Unable to face the lack of security and terrified of being held for ransom, several tens of thousands of upper-middle-class Iraqis - lawyers, doctors, engineers, ie the very people the country needs if it is to be reconstructed - have fled to neighbouring countries. </p> <p>After several dozen of their lorry-drivers were kidnapped and, in some cases, murdered, many of the Turkish, Kuwaiti and Jordanian haulage companies that used to cover thousands of kilometres every day to bring supplies to the coalition's military bases have pulled out of Iraq. Several big Arab investors who were quick to muscle into Iraq in the hope of landing lucrative reconstruction contracts have been repatriating their assets. </p> <p>Faced with an almost totally chaotic situation, several of the US's military allies have jumped ship. The Spanish government decided this summer to bring its 1,430 troops home because it was convinced that the bomb attacks that killed almost 200 people in Madrid in March were connected with Spain's presence in Iraq. Honduras and the Dominican Republic followed suit. </p> <p>There remains the British contingent. It has become a hotly debated issue. \"Quit Iraq, and quit fast. It's that simple,\" columnist Simon Jenkins wrote in The Times on September 22. Ten days earlier, an editorial in The Financial Times advocated the same thing in more sober terms: \"It is time to think about pulling out.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday October 18 2004</strong></p> <p>In the article below we state that \"Clara Schumann's singing ability was lauded<br> at the time far in excess of her brother Robert's compositions\".<br> Clara Schumann (nee Wieck, 1819- 96) was actually a concert<br> pianist who married the composer Robert Schumann. </p> <p></p> <p> <br>When I talk to people about the theremin and how I use it in my stage show, there is usually a moment of surly incomprehension. I follow it up with: \"You know, the thing that goes wooooo-eeeee .\" Ah, now it's smiles and Tennent's Super all round. It can get frustrating. If you were a trumpet player introducing yourself at a party, and the word \"trumpet\" was met with blank looks, and you had to mime an air trumpet, and say: \"You know, the thing that goes tah tah parp parp,\" it would get quite tiresome.</p> <p>The theremin was invented by accident in 1919 by Leon Theremin, a Russian scientist, and so this makes it the world's first electronic instrument. He was working on radio surveillance equipment and pioneering an early form of television when, as you do of an evening, he happened to move his hands between two high-frequency oscillators. Normally when you do this, as I am sure you are aware, they produce a single note way beyond the realm of human hearing. However, in this case, the natural body capacitance of his hands luckily controlled the electrical field in the air between the antennae. It produced an ethereal, haunting sound, not unlike wooo-eeeeee .</p> <p>He immediately roused the suspicions of the KGB - or rather, the equivalent at the time - who regarded the device as a state secret and monitored his work very closely. Or, more likely, they thought he was a weirdo who might do something stupid, like try to magnetise Lenin.</p> <p>He continued perfecting his invention until 1927, when the KGB were closing in and he fled to America, where his career flourished and his creation was hailed as the greatest instrument of the future.</p> <p>Back then it would have been a truly strange sight. It consisted of a large wooden box on thick legs. A metal loop protruded horizontally from one side and a vertical aerial sprouted from the other. It resembled a child's drawing of what a robot might look like.</p> <p>The player would stand behind the box and move his left hand through the loop to control the volume, and his right hand back and forth towards the aerial to control the pitch. It was, and is, fiendishly difficult to play, which led to a bit of a drop-off in interest after an initial rash of theremins being sold to excited amateurs. Nonetheless, it gained huge media interest to the point that Leon Theremin became something of a celebrity on the New York social scene.</p> <p>It was here that he met Clara Rockmore, an accomplished violinist who was born in Lithuania in 1911. She had an extraordinary affinity with the theremin, playing it with a dexterity and depth of feeling that has not since been matched. A photo of her in 1930 shows a beautiful young woman, her arms raised aloft, a look of intense rapture on her face. As she said, to master the theremin \"every movement you make is a perfect synchronisation of sound and motion\". The sound of the early theremins was somewhere between a violin and a ghostly human voice, so for audiences at that time the combination of this and her charismatic presence must have been captivating.</p> <p>What may have been the key to her skill with the instrument is that she had \"perfect pitch\". This is the term given to those people who can pluck a given note out of the air and hum it without reference to a piano. As the very essence of theremin playing is quite literally plucking a note from thin air, this would seem to be a distinct advantage. Perfect pitch, or absolute pitch as it's sometimes called, occurs entirely at random in about one in every 10,000 of us, and I'm one of them. From as early as I can remember, I was able to pick out the pitch of things, not just instruments but washing machines, vacuum cleaners, dentists' drills. There will be people who have perfect pitch who have no musical ability or interest whatsoever and bumble through life wondering why they can hum the exact pitch of a Magimix. It's not just humans; songbirds and even wolves have perfect pitch. This is an idea I've had for a documentary: Getting a Wolf to Play the Theremin.</p> <p>Clara Rockmore was rightly hailed in her time as a true star. Just as Clara Schumann's singing ability was lauded at the time far in excess of her brother Robert's compositions, Rockmore gained more recognition for her playing of the instrument than Theremin himself ever did for inventing it. She regularly gave recitals through the 1930s and 1940s, receiving warm praise from music critics. At the time, it was seen as a new legitimate orchestral instrument and her repertoire was wide-ranging. She continued to perform with the theremin and was the subject of numerous films and documentaries until her death in 1998.</p> <p>For Leon Theremin, things didn't pan out quite so well. Although he patented his device in 1929 and licenced RCA to sell it, it wasn't the huge success he had hoped. Things went more pear-shaped in 1938, when he was kidnapped by the KGB at his New York apartment and spirited back to the USSR, where he was imprisoned for anti-Soviet activity. He spent many hard years in a labour camp, and eventually ended up in a one-bedroom flat in Moscow, where he died in 1993.</p> <p>His legacy, the theremin, lives on and the sound he brought to the world has been immortalised in cult film soundtracks like Spellbound and The Day the Earth Stood Still. Brian Wilson's own musical genius found a home for it on Good Vibrations. But it's not just an arcane musical oddity. More and more new bands and musicians are discovering the theremin as the technology has allowed for a greater user-friendliness. Beck, Portishead and most recently Goldfrapp have been entranced by its strangeness.</p> <p>I have been using theremins in my live shows for the last six years. It was a tiny handheld one at first, with just a pitch aerial. These days I have two Bob Moog's Etherwave theremins, which are terrific live instruments. Apart from the surprising variety of sounds, from deep growls to fine, high, singing vibratos, they require a degree of physicality to play. You can dance around them, play them with guitars, kazoos, cans of beer, whatever.</p> <p>It seems unfair that Leon Theremin, inventor, visionary and scientist didn't have the freedom to pursue the life of a respected academic that he might have had in the west. His ideas were too far ahead of his time perhaps - like Brian Wilson, he \"just wasn't made for these times\". It's not all doom though. In the latter part of his life, he gave lectures to informed and respectful audiences in Europe after his \"rediscovery\" in 1989. It must have come as a balm to the many years of isolation and hardship in Russia. A consolation for the sort of scene that might have played out at his Moscow apartment block. As he moves in, some of the tenants outside stop him and ask: \"Are you the new bloke?\" \"Yes I am Leon Theremin, inventor of the theremin.\" Nothing, just blank looks. \"You know, the thing that goes woooooo-eeeeee ?' Smiles and Stoli all round!</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Good Vibrations: The Story of the Theremin is on Radio 4 next Thursday. Bill Bailey plays the Apollo, London W1, from October 25 and releases his live DVD on November 22</p>",
  "<p> 'A couple of years ago we couldn't have given away pink T-shirts,\" admits Roger Wade, creative director at Boxfresh. \"Now it's our bestselling colour. It has gone from last choice to first.\" </p> <p>You see, there is a significant change in the air. Until recently, straight men just didn't do pink. But just as they embraced man-bags with pride and not a flutter of femininity, fashionable heterosexual men are adopting pink as their new favourite colour. Witness Jude Law wearing a pink shirt in the soon-to-be-released remake of Alfie, saying, \"If you ooze masculinity like some of us do, you have no reason to fear pink.\" Observe Lee Ryan from Blue thrashing about on the stage of T4's Pop Beach in a hot-pink T-shirt. Check out the dapper-duo Big Boi and Andre 3000 of OutKast forever sporting pale-pink Lacoste polo shirts, pink shirts and pastel cardigans, or Justin Timberlake in a pink shirt and matching stripy tie. </p> <p>According to Topman's design director, Gordon Richardson, these guys are the reason why our guys are finally giving in to season upon season of colourful menswear on the catwalk. \"As with most things, men just have to be reassured that it's OK,\" says Richardson. \"They need to see things out of the stores and on the street and television.\" But Richardson insists that men have always been partial to pink. \"They've always worn it, but not full on. There's been pink in their ties and hidden in stripes. Historically, look at matadors, they always wore pink and were so flamboyant. You can't get much more macho than a bullfighter.\" </p> <p>Yeah, but that's different. Continental European men have never been shy about mixing acidic orange with their slinky spandex. But according to Richardson, climate could be a reason why British men are one step behind their European brothers when it comes to walking on the wild side. \"Very soft colours don't look as good on pale skin,\" he says, referring to pastel pink. This could explain why the best-looking mixes out there seem to be fancy fuchsia and denim. Among the fashionable, Duffer-loving crowd who have embraced pink, a hot-pink polo shirt teamed with some threadbare vintage Evisus imported from the depths of Japan has become a signature look. </p> <p>Not everyone is new to the delights of the fairest shade of all. For (heterosexual) photographer David Titlow, wearing pink has never been a problem. \"I felt comfortable wearing pink from a very early age,\" says the former singer with 1980s band Blue Mercedes. \"It was a punk-rock thing for me, especially fluorescent pink. I had a see-through raincoat in Day-Glo pink that was torn from my back at a Boomtown Rats gig in 1978. I guess it's more acceptable now because all men are now so obsessed with everything from personal grooming to beard-trimming to handling balsamic vinegar and olive oil that wearing pink seems to be the least of our worries.\" </p> <p>Like most girls, I love pink - and to see it on a handsome man is heaven. So imagine my delight to see it popping up all over the spring 2005 menswear collections. Hugo Boss, Paul Smith, Dries van Noten, Alexander McQueen, Etro and Calvin Klein are all pushing pink. I imagine I would rather like Dylan Jones, editor of GQ, since he certainly likes a bit of pink. \"One of my favourite items of clothing is a pink Lands' End cash mere V-neck sweater,\" he tells me. \"I can't see anything wrong with wearing pink, frankly. To say pink is a gay colour is not only pejorative, it's just plain wrong. Men have worn pink socks since the 1950s, and pink trousers have been around since the 1960s. I probably wouldn't wear all these things at once, but you get my drift.\" </p> <p>Snooping around the Men's Health website, I see that not everyone is convinced that pink doesn't mean gay. Men are getting very het up over suggestions that they wear a pink polo shirt with a bright green tie. (For the record, that is a bad move.) \"Er, excuse me, no way should any man wear a pink shirt . . . no wonder you guys spend all your time weightlifting, it's because you're worried you'll get beaten up,\" said one disgruntled reader. In the colour's defence, one guy piped up with, \"It's a bit of material with a colour in it,\" but another slammed him right back down. \"Yeah, but a pretty gay colour!\" </p> <p>But such attitudes are way out of vogue. And according to Wade and Richardson, pink is just the tip of the iceberg. \"I think it's become an acceptable colour for guys to wear and they don't feel alienated wearing it,\" says Wade. \"But there has been a move towards brighter and pastel colours such as sky blue, emerald green, purple, and pink is a part of that story.\" </p> <p>Richardson agrees and says that at Topman, they have done more colour than ever before. \"In spring we introduced a softer palette of mint, pastel pink and lemon and for autumn, we've done deeper pinks. It's great for us as it makes a change from blue, black and grey.\" But like Jones, Richardson isn't promoting a full-on approach with the colour pink. \"What men shouldn't do is wear it head to toe,\" he says. \"And anyway, apple green is the new pink.\"</p>",
  "<p> I'm up to my left eyeball with the promotional materials of this interactive world. You know the ones I'm talking about. BMX XXX. Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball. Boy-centred, sexually aggressive, niche. What about the great stuff that's inside? The diversity of players? The possibilities that are, potentially, endless? I'm putting myself out on a limb here, but I think games ads are shooting the industry in the foot.</p> <p>Take, for example, the campaign for <a href=\"http://www.eidosinteractive.com/games/info.html?gmid=81\">Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix</a>. Perhaps someone felt there was something to hide because the advertisement ignored the dynamic action adventure between two powerful females and instead focussed on a non-existent lesbian relationship between the characters, and plastered that all over the London Underground.</p> <p>Need anything be said about <a href=\"http://www.xbox.com/en-us/doaebvolleyball/default.htm\">Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball</a>? A title, it has been claimed, which should appeal to a female audience for the \"character development\" possibilities? Unfortunately, the emphasis on \"realistic breast-bouncing action\" had the opposite effect on the potential consumers, and women stayed away in droves. This game has never entered my wish list, not even for the \"possibilities\".</p> <p>What about <a href=\"http://ps2.ign.com/articles/377/377283p1.html\">BMX XXX</a>, a game in which the female characters were only clothed for a downhill mountain bike racing because major retail distributors refused to carry it? And the ill-fated Lara Croft images, that had Tomb Raider 4 promoted by the digital bombshell wearing only a towel?</p> <p>Strangely, it seems very little attention has been paid to this issue. As far as I'm aware \u2013 and please correct me if I'm wrong because I really want to know more \u2013 only one study has explicitly explored the effect marketing has on girls' use of gaming tech. Gareth Schott recently presented his and Siobhan Thomas' research paper \"'For Men': Examining female reactions to Nintendo's marketing for GameBoy Advance SP\" at the <a href=\"http://www.nzgdc.org.nz/index.php\">New Zealand Game Developers Conference</a>, and suggested that the advertisements have a real impact on why women stay away from games. Once women engage with the games, they have as much fun as the men do.</p> <p>Check out some real ads for real game products and see if you think they're appealing to girls:</p> <p><a onclick=\"window.open('http://blogs.theguardian.com/games/archives/images/feareffect.html','popup','width=600,height=400,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\" href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/games/archives/images/feareffect.html\">Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix</a></p> <p><a onclick=\"window.open('http://blogs.theguardian.com/games/archives/images/bmxxxx.html','popup','width=150,height=194,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\" href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/games/archives/images/bmxxxx.html\">BMX XXX</a></p> <p><a onclick=\"window.open('http://blogs.theguardian.com/games/archives/images/NintendoGBASPForMen1.html','popup','width=800,height=640,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\" href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/games/archives/images/NintendoGBASPForMen1.html\">Gameboy Advance SP</a></p> <p><a onclick=\"window.open('http://blogs.theguardian.com/games/archives/images/doaceach1.html','popup','width=300,height=431,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\" href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/games/archives/images/doaceach1.html\">Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball</a></p> <p>Another point to ponder is where the promotional materials enter into public consciousness. Women are less likely to be aware of the breadth of computerized entertainment and are often solely exposed to titles that are owned by male relatives or colleagues. Only exceptional titles that are expected to have a wide appeal, like the 2004 European release of Sony's karaoke game <a href=\"http://www.singstargame.com/\">SingStar</a>, are placed in traditionally women's magazines or are advertised during \"women's\" television programming; the propensity of the marketing and PR departments is to publicize the release of games in male-valenced and specialist genres, thus directing the product towards the audience which is most likely to produce substantial revenue. That's OK if you want to continue the status quo. I've been led to believe (up the garden path or not) that this isn't the intention of the interactive entertainment industry.</p> <p>Admittedly, it is exceedingly difficult it is to get any games-related material into female lifestyle magazines, and congratulations to those who have been able to do it. However, surely there are ways to spin the product so it appears positive, empowering and worthwhile. Why can't there be more clever, genderless ads, like those for Playstation's \"<a href=\"http://xfersf02.ign.com/^570067585/movies/ps2movies.ign.com/docroot/media/news/video/thirdplace/wolfman.mpeg?position=front\">The Third Place</a>\" (an mpeg of <a href=\"http://www.onedotzero.com/track.php?id=27&amp;dvd=2\">Tim Hope</a>'s \"The Wolfman\" ad), <a href=\"http://www.kontraband.com/show/show.asp?ID=117\">Dreamcast</a>'s online service (apologies to the Germans) and Xbox's (<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,53016,00.html?tw=wn_story_related\">banned</a>) \"<a href=\"http://www.visit4info.com/details.cfm?adid=13859&amp;type=coolad&amp;startrow=1\">Life's too Short</a>\" ad?</p> <p>While there are many other issues to address when it comes to expanding the games market, a primary solution to the problem problem is to focus on the marketing.

  "Britain's former ambassador to Uzbekistan accused the Foreign Office today of making false allegations against him in an attempt to force him from his post. <p>The Foreign Office said that Craig Murray had now been withdrawn from his post for \"operational reasons\" following a series of public differences of opinion with his employers. </p> <p>Mr Murray has courted controversy since being appointed ambassador in Tashkent in 2002 by taking an unusually outspoken stance - for a diplomat - over claims that political and religious prisoners have been tortured by the Uzbek government. </p> <p>Earlier this week, details were revealed of a memo he sent to the Foreign Office, complaining that MI6 was using information passed on to it by the CIA but originally obtained in Uzbek torture cells. </p> <p>As well as being morally and legally wrong, the practice was unreliable because prisoners under torture could be expected to say whatever their tormentors wanted to hear, he warned. </p> <p>In his first comments following his sacking, Mr Murray told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he believed senior figures in the Foreign Office had wanted to eject him from office for some time. </p> <p>\"I would like to say that this time last year I was facing 18 disciplinary charges, including some quite extraordinary allegations.\" </p> <p>They included a claim that he had arranged visas in exchange for sex with young women, which was \"completely, absolutely untrue,\" he said. </p> <p>\"On 16 of the allegations there wasn't even any supporting evidence to bring them to a hearing, including that one. I don't believe that when the office laid the allegations the office themselves believed that they were true,\" Mr Murray added. </p> <p>\"I believe this was a ploy intended to force me into a resignation from my post a year ago.\" </p> <p>Asked who he believed to be responsible for that ploy, Mr Murray said: \"I think at senior levels in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office they found my position in Tashkent and the arguments I was advancing unacceptable, and they were looking for a reason to get rid of me. </p> <p>\"When I was presented with those allegations I was given one week to resign, and I don't think it would occur to people that I wouldn't resign. I know for certain that the foreign secretary was briefed about the disciplinary charges against me, about my possible removal from post at that time.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The problem of evidence obtained by torture being used in Britain is not confined to Uzbekistan or Guant\u00e1namo, according to a leading human rights group. </p> <p>The director of Fair Trials Abroad, Stephen Jakobi, said: \"Today there is great concern over the report that torture evidence obtained by Uzbekistan authorities is being used by UK intelligence authorities and may creep into the British justice system. The problem is in fact already much nearer to home than this.\"</p> <p>A group of prisoners known as the \"Egyptian three\" - Britons Reza Pankhurst , Maajid Nawaz and Ian Nisbet - were sentenced to three years in an Egyptian jail in March 2004 for what Mr Jakobi calls the \"non-existent crime\" of belonging to an illegal organisation.</p> <p>The organisation in question, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, has never been banned in Egypt or the United Kingdom, where the defendants joined, according to Fair Trials Abroad.</p> <p>Mr Jakobi said: \"The evidence against them was 'confessions' obtained by torture. We should make it clear that the FCO have always accepted that there is foundation in the torture complaints and continue to do what they can to make representations to the Egyptian authorities.</p> <p>\"The problem remains that it is not clear what they might be alleged to have said, under torture or otherwise, about innocent Britons who may or may not be members of this legal organisation - and what use intelligence and law enforcement authorities may be making of this information despite the official FCO attitude to this case.\"</p> <p>He said there was also concern that \"the virus of evidence\" obtained by torture being would spread throughout the EU by the proposed European evidence warrant.</p>",
  "Two more men were today arrested in connection with the drive-by shooting of 14-year-old Danielle Beccan in Nottingham. <p>The men, from Nottingham, were arrested in the city early this morning. Detectives were questioning them about the youngster's murder. </p> <p>The development came as officers continued to question a man arrested in London on Monday night. Four others detained with him were yesterday released without charge. </p> <p>Danielle was shot dead yards from her home in the St Ann's area of Nottingham on Saturday. She had been returning from the city's annual Goose Fair with a group of friends when she was hit by one of several shots fired from a passing gold-coloured car. </p> <p>Nottingham detectives said they were unable to explain why Danielle or her friends might have been targeted by gunmen, and fear she was the victim of a random attack. </p> <p>Families living close to the scene of the shooting claim the area is a haven for drug dealers and users, and two weeks ago began a petition calling for CCTV cameras to be installed. </p> <p>Danielle's mother, Paula Platt, yesterday spoke for the first time about how she had cradled her dying daughter after the apparently motiveless attack. </p> <p>Mrs Platt said her last words to Danielle were: \"I love you. Come back to us, I will be waiting for you.\" Her daughter's reply - and her last words before she lost consciousness - were: \"I love you too, mum.\"</p> <p>Mrs Platt, 32, said she had been left feeling \"numb\" by the death of her daughter. \"I am crying inside. My heart is in two, three, four pieces. It's in bits,\" she said. \"There are no words that can describe how I feel. If you take the worst you could feel and multiply it by a million, it would not even come close.\"</p>",
  "<p>If a back catalogue of heartbreak and misery are the credentials for a soul singer, Terry Callier is well qualified for the job. Born in the Chicago projects, Callier has had a lifetime of broken dreams. His 1965 debut, The New Folk Sound of Terry Callier, with its tinges of folk and jazz and state-of-the-nation lyrics, is one of the great 60s soul albums, but a series of bad breaks meant that it remained obscure until the early 1990s when Callier, by then working as a computer programmer at the University of Chicago, was discovered by a new generation. The setbacks began at the age of 17 when his mother told him that, rather than become a superstar on the legendary Chess label, he had to stay at home and revise for his exams.</p> <p>\"I started in doo-wop groups when I was about 12,\" says Callier, who seems to have used the experiences of his troubled life to build wisdom rather than bitterness. \"And what set the best ones apart was that they wrote their own material. Some of the poetry was fantastic: the Moroccos had a song called Bang Goes Your Heart and the Eldorados had Crazy Little Mama, and they're just beautiful I still listen to them today. They made me realise that you have to be original.\"</p> <p>Callier spent his lunch periods at high school singing in the bathrooms, principally because the marble walls created a nice echo. \"I remember like it was yesterday the time the guys in the group let me sing This Is the Night by the Cool Jets, after a year of being in the background. Some guy stopped me half way and said: 'Why are you trying to sound like somebody else? Just try and sound like you .' That was the most influential thing anyone ever told me.\"</p> <p>By the time he was 17, Callier joined Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters at Chess records after taking an audition. He went in the following Monday to make a recording and by Saturday his debut single was a hit. Leonard Chess asked Callier to join Etta James and Muddy Waters on a Chess tour of America, so he went home to pack his suitcase. That was when his mother stepped in. \"I didn't say anything to her apart from 'pass the mustard' for a week or two, but in retrospect she made the right decision. At that age, I would have done everything to excess.\" Three years later Callier was at college, where he was exposed to the folk music explosion that hit America in the early 60s. \"A guy in the dorm room had a guitar and he was always teaching me songs. So I went down to a coffee house in Chicago, and soon I was playing Wednesday through Sunday at that coffee house and having the time of my life. So I had to go to my mum again and say: 'Now I'm really not going back to school.' This time she said OK.\"</p> <p>Alongside Bob Dylan, Fred Neil and a local folk singer called Bob Gibson, Callier was discovering John Coltrane, who had just released his free jazz album A Love Supreme. \"He was playing at a little club called McKees, and I got there early to see Elvin Jones nailing his drum kit to the floor. Then the quartet rocks on stage, and I wasn't prepared for the intensity with which these guys threw themselves into the music - I had never seen men do that before in my life and it frightened me. It made me realise that everything in life was in this music: the beautiful and the ugly, the godly and ungodly. Not everybody wants to touch those places because there are things we have to forget in order to live with ourselves, and that music didn't let you have any secrets.\"</p> <p>Callier recorded his album, The New Folk Sound, under the influence of Coltrane, using two upright basses and two acoustic guitars to create a unique sound. The record would probably have been a hit but for the fact that its producer, Samuel Charters, took the tapes of The New Folk Sound on a voyage of self-discovery into the North American desert, where he lived with the Yaki Indians for the next three years. The album was finally released on Prestige in 1968, and Callier only knew about it after his brother saw it in a Chicago antiques store. \"I went in, bought the album, and took it home. Then I decided to make another go of it.\" Callier kept making records and touring until 1983, when he received a call from his 12-year-old daughter. She told him that she was coming to live with him in Chicago, so he gave up showbusiness for the job with the University of Chicago. \"I didn't touch a guitar from 1983 until 1988 because I was just too busy. Then in 1991 I got a call from a guy in London called Eddie Pillar, who ran a label called Acid Jazz. He told me that he had been playing my records in clubs and he wanted to re-release them and get me playing in England again. So for the next few years, I came over to do gigs in London in my vacation time from my day job.\"</p> <p>In 1998 Callier's album Timepeace won a United Nations award, which meant that his employers at the University of Chicago finally learned about his double life. After picking up the award in New York, he came into work to discover that he had four hours to clear his desk. His new album, Lookin' Out, marks the latest stage in what has happened in his life since then. \"After all that had happened over the years, I wasn't looking to be a musician again because I had got used to having that pay cheque every two weeks. I've been inspired by Billie Holiday and Miles Davis, and I think that Hank Williams was a genius, but those people were never going to do anything but make music and live that life. That's not me. If I hadn't lost my job, I wouldn't be here now.\"</p>",
  "<p>One in 10 councils has taken no action to prepare for drinks licensing reforms due to come into effect next February, according to research published today.</p> <p>Of the 234 local authorities across England and Wales surveyed by social and economic analysts QA Research, 10% have so far failed to consult with any other public services or the local community about changes to their licensing policy.</p> <p>Of those councils that have taken action, a quarter have yet to consult any of the other statutory organisations, such as the police or fire service, affected by the reforms. Fewer still have consulted other groups affected, including taxi drivers and young people.</p> <p>There is also widespread concern that social services departments have not been involved in reviewing licensing applications or revisions to existing ones.</p> <p>Under the Licensing Act 2003, local authorities will take over control of alcohol or entertainment licence applications from magistrates on February 7. </p> <p>Alistair Turnham, an economist at QA Research, said: \"Relatively few social services departments were consulted by councils for input on licensing applications. Social services should be involved as they need to ensure that children will be protected at premises selling alcohol.\"</p> <p>QA Research warned that this poor progress could lead to many councils facing legal challenges on the basis that their new licensing policies were not consulted upon and do not reflect the views of the local community.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said officials were not concerned about the progress being made by local authorities to prepare for their new role. </p> <p>She said councils are consulting other bodies currently, and that the new measures would reduce the time taken to issue licences by cutting bureaucracy.</p>",
  "<p>Student leaders today labelled the Office for Fair Access (Offa) \"toothless\", claiming it had been so watered down under pressure from universities that it was a \"shadow\" of what was once promised. </p> <p>The comments by the National Union of Students (NUS) follow this morning's announcement of the appointment of Sir Martin Harris, a former Russell Group university vice-chancellor, as the admissions watchdog's first director.</p> <p>In a week of intense national debate on university admissions practices, yesterday's speech by the new higher education minister, Kim Howells, was the strongest attempt yet to allay the fears of university bosses that they would not be prosecuted for missing their benchmarks for widening participation to university.</p> <p>The creation of Offa was inserted into the higher education bill at the eleventh hour in a bid to avert a backbench rebellion from Labour MPs who feared the new top-up fees would put poorer students off going to university. </p> <p>It has no remit over universities' admissions policies, but has the power to stop universities from charging top-up fees beyond the current \u00a31,200 a year and issue \u00a3500,000 penalties where universities are making no real efforts - through bursaries and outreach work - to meet their benchmarks, which they set in negotiation with Offa. </p> <p>But those penalties would not be automatic, Mr Howells promised yesterday, while this morning, as Sir Martin's appointment was announced, he said he hoped the penalties would never have to be used. Both Oxford and Cambridge are currently missing their benchmarks by around 20 percentage points.</p> <p>Hannah Essex, the vice-president of the NUS, told EducationGuardian.co.uk: \"We're struggling to see what Offa is going to be able to do. It's been so watered down since the original proposal. It's going to be toothless. It's not really going to do anything if it doesn't have any power over admissions. </p> <p>\"I did feel yesterday that the minister is doing everything he can to reassure the institutions and primarily the Russell Group [but] those reassurances are not necessarily in the best interest of access or students.\" </p> <p>She added: \"My understanding is that Offa has been totally watered down. There are MPs who voted with the government on the bill because Offa improved access, but Offa has proved to be a shadow of what was promised.\" </p> <p>Wes Streeting, the president of the Cambridge student union said: \"The marginal MPs that wavered over the bill thought they were getting something far more robust [than Offa]. </p> <p>\"MPs have been duped into buying into this Office for Fair Access. It's toothless, it won't do the job of ensuring admissions are fair.\" </p> <p>He added that he didn't believe the watchdog should be able to set quotas for admissions of state school pupils, but it should be able to criticise admissions practices.</p> <p>Lecturers in the new universities echoed her comments. The general secretary of the lecturers' union Natfhe, Paul Mackney, said: \"It is disturbing to hear the higher education minister, Kim Howells, this week declaring that there will not necessarily be any penalties for universities which fail to reach the targets they agree with Offa. </p> <p>\"While sanctions should arguably be a last resort this appears to contradict the original definition of Offa's role and powers. As the weeks have passed since legislation established Offa, we have seen the government soften its line on widening participation. The policy needs to be clarified if the new Offa director is to have any impact. \"</p>",
  "<p>The writer of next Monday night's episode of BBC1 spy drama Spooks, in which a fictional government scientist gets into hot water when he becomes involved with the security services, has admitted the character is deliberately modelled on the late David Kelly.</p> <p>Leftwing playwright Howard Brenton, who scripted Monday's instalment of Spooks, said he wanted to explore the theme of \"a very decent man who is put under enormous pressure\".</p> <p>The episode features a government scientist, Professor Fred Roberts, played by Ian McDiarmid, who is blackmailed by MI5 into becoming the bait to catch a terrorist cell.</p> <p>Sporting a grey beard, McDiarmid's Roberts bears an uncanny resemblance to Dr Kelly, who committed suicide in July last year after being outed as the source of BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan's story alleging that the government \"sexed up\" the September 2002 dossier on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>Like Dr Kelly, the fictional scientist is also married with three daughters and his life is destroyed by his decision to get involved with the security services.</p> <p><strong>'A decent man who is put unnder pressure'</strong></p> <p>\"We did want to have a theme of a very decent man who is put under enormous pressure and whose weakness is his own vanity. I thought that was interesting,\" Mr Brenton said of the Professor Roberts character in next Monday's episode.</p> <p>The first episode of the new series of Spooks, broadcast on Monday, also featured obvious parallels with Gilligan's allegation that the government pressurised the security services into providing intelligence for the dossier that would strengthen the case for going to war with Iraq.</p> <p>Monday's episode featured a fictional No 10 adviser pressurising Tim McInnerny's head of the joint intelligence committee to bring MI5 more closely under government control.</p> <p>\"What was on my mind was the dossier and how MI6 had appeared to have been put under enormous political pressure. It had occurred to me that in reality the JIC had become more and more powerful and I wanted to reflect that,\" said Mr Brenton, who also wrote the first episode of the new Spooks series and whose theatre credits include Pravda and The Romans in Britain.</p> <p>\"There is a culture at the moment within government of loose cannons who are not elected but who are increasingly influential and seem to despise ministers who sit around the cabinet table. They are shadowy, unelected voices, who spend their time whispering in the ear of the prime minister.\"</p> <p><strong>Storyline 'is not revenge for dossier row'</strong></p> <p>Publicly the BBC is insisting that the Spooks storylines are not revenge for last year's Iraq dossier row with government, which saw both the BBC director general Greg Dyke and chairman Gavyn Davies lose their jobs following publication of the Hutton report.</p> <p>However, BBC drama insiders privately insist the parallels in Spooks are a deliberate provocation.</p> <p>BBC sources admitted a key scene in the first episode of Spooks was altered at the last minute to allow Peter Firth's character, MI5 boss Harry Pearce, to accuse the government of wanting a neutered intelligence service that could deliver a \"whitewash\".</p> <p>\"You want to reduce us to some kind of firm of decorators only to be wheeled out when you want some kind of whitewash,\" Pearce tells McInnerny's JIC chief.</p> <p>\"Whitewash\" was one of the accusations that senior BBC figures have levelled at the government over the Iraq dossier affair since the publication of the Hutton report in January.</p> <p>Scripts for this third series of Spooks were commissioned about a year ago, towards the end of Mr Dyke's controversial tenure, when he was fighting the government over BBC claims that ministers had manipulated intelligence to bolster the case for the Iraq war.</p> <p>\"The storyline [for the first episode] was inspired by Hutton but we are not presenting anything as fact, and [while] the characters are drawn from real life figures, they are not based on any one person,\" said the executive producer, Jane Featherstone.</p> <p>\"It is up to drama to reflect real issues - we have done that. The whitewash line was added because it felt right and more current to a story which had been conceived long before.\"</p> <p>Ms Featherstone has also admitted parallels with the real-life mistreatment of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib and Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention centres in episode nine of Spooks, which will deals with the ethics of torturing suspects involved in possible terrorist atrocities. </p> <p>And in episode 10, the last of the current series, a group of Iraqis take a number of Britons hostage, a storyline with chilling echoes of the real-life abductions of westerners in the country.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Last night, as the row over benchmarks, targets and access to university gathered momentum, Michael Sterling, the chair of the Russell Group, issued a warning to whoever was appointed the new director of fair access: \"We've given notice that we're watching,\" he said. </p> <p>He hardly needed to be worried. In Sir Martin Harris, whose appointment as the head of the Office for Fair Access (Offa) was announced this morning, universities have a watchdog who at least understands the dilemmas of vice-chancellors. </p> <p>Sir Martin, aged 60, retired from Manchester University having secured this year's merger between Manchester and neighbouring Umist. A Cambridge graduate, he was vice-chancellor at Essex University and as a former president of the Committee of vice-chancellors and principals - Universities UK's predecessor - he knows the breadth of universities, as well as his own Russell Group heartland. He was knighted for his \"services to education\" in 2000.</p> <p>His appointment comes as university access, and admissions, retains its place in national debate. </p> <p>There has been considerable angst about university admissions and access over the last few weeks. New benchmarks set centrally for universities are the most challenging ever, and a change in the benchmarking method has left some universities struggling with what they call impossible targets.</p> <p>Attacks from Oxford University, first from the head of Trinity College Michael Beloff, who told the government to \"get their tanks off our lawns,\" and threatened that the university could be forced to go private within 15 years. </p> <p>This week, the university's chancellor, Chris Patten, echoed Beloff's calls, adding an attack on the government's \"appalling\" attempts to \"socially engineer\" university intake. </p> <p>Such statements from Britain's top universities had made the government unusually keen to allay their fears. Yesterday's promises from the new higher education minister, Kim Howells, that there would be no \"automatic\" penalties for missed targets and that there was \"no hidden agenda\" on admissions, were today followed by soothing sounds from the education secretary. </p> <p>Charles Clarke's statement today that he expects there to be a \"healthy relationship\" between institutions and Sir Martin adds to those attempts to calm the waters.</p> <p>In that context, the top universities may well be reassured by Sir Martin's appointment. He's \"one of them\" rather than the worst-case scenario which had been mooted: the appointment of someone outside the sector. Universities UK today welcomed his appointment. </p> <p>Sir Martin's his own personal background makes him further suited to the job. As the first in his family to go to university, he is deeply committed to widening participation, even to the point that he struggled, unlike many of his Russell Group colleagues, to reconcile his ideas with the concept of top-up fees.</p> <p>So what's in his inbox? A lot. By December most universities are expecting to announce their pricing plans for top-up fees. Before they can do that they have to secure their access agreements with Offa. Over 100 universities, the overwhelming majority of which will want to charge the highest amount of \u00a33,000, have to negotiate what they will do to widen participation with the director. </p> <p>It's no mean feat. But for the universities, at least they will be negotiating with a known quantity.</p>",
  "US forces today continued a wave of air and ground assaults on the rebel-held city of Falluja after local officials broke off peace talks and said US and Iraqi authorities were making impossible demands. <p>Early this morning, two air strikes were launched against sites that US military officials said were being used as planning centres for terrorist operations by senior associates of the Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. </p> <p>Earlier this week, the interim Iraqi prime minister, Ayad Allawi, demanded that local officials hand over Zarqawi in order to prevent strikes on the city. However, officials in Falluja suspended peace talks yesterday, saying they could not be expected to locate and hand over a man who even well-armed US forces had been unable to find.</p> <p>Iraqi police and witnesses reported that US troops today arrested the city's chief negotiator, Khaled al-Jumaili, and its police chief, Sabar al-Janabi. Two other police officers were also detained. US military officials claim Falluja is the base of operations for Zarqawi's Tawhid and Jihad group, which claimed responsibility for the kidnap and murder of the British engineer Ken Bigley. </p> <p>Overnight, warplanes and artillery hammered at the city, which is 65km (40 miles) west of Baghdad, as two US marine battalions attacked rebel positions to \"restore security and stability\", First Lieutenant Lyle Gilbert, a spokesman for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, told CNN. </p> <p>Three people were killed and seven others injured during the night, according to Dr Rafi'a Hiyad, of Falluja general hospital. Yesterday, hospital staff said at least five people had been killed and 16 wounded. </p> <p>Operations against Sunni insurgent areas have been stepped up in recent weeks prior to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins today. Last year, Ramadan was accompanied by a wave of violence. </p> <p>\"The operations were designed to target the large terrorist element operating in the area of Falluja,\" the US command said. \"This element has been planning to use the holy month of Ramadan for attacks.\"</p> <p>Beginning on Thursday afternoon, the operation started with air strikes and continued with ground assaults by US marines, soldiers and Iraqi forces. The US military claimed it had destroyed several key planning centres, a weapons storage facility, two safehouses, a terrorist meeting site and several illegal checkpoints used by Zarqawi's network. </p> <p>Yesterday, residents reported huge US bombardments by planes and armoured vehicles, describing what they said was the most intensive shelling since US forces began attacks on the city. </p> <p>One resident said US forces were using loudspeakers in the west of the city to urge fighters to lay down their arms \"because we are going to push into Falluja\". </p> <p>Tawhid and Jihad, which the US believes is based in the city, claimed responsibility for yesterday's twin suicide bombings inside Baghdad's heavily fortified green zone. At least six people, including four US security contractors, were killed in the attacks. </p> <p>Negotiations had been aimed at restoring government control to Falluja, which fell under the control of clerics and their armed followers after the end of a three-week US siege in April. The talks broke down yesterday after city representatives said handing over Zarqawi was an \"impossible condition\", Abu Asaad, spokesman for the mujahideen council of Falluja, said. </p> <p>\"Since we exhausted all peaceful solutions, the city is now ready to bear arms and defend its religion and honour and it is not afraid of Allawi's statements,\" Mr Asaad, speaking to the al-Jazeera television channel, said. </p> <p>However, he used the Arabic word for \"suspend\", implying that talks could resume later. \"Military operations didn't even stop when the negotiating delegation was in Baghdad,\" he said. \"Dozens are killed every day. Entire families have been eliminated.\" </p> <p>The government has made no comment about the breakdown of the Falluja talks. However, the national security adviser, Qassem Dawoud, said military operations against the city would continue until it had been \"cleansed of terrorists\". </p> <p>Mr Dawoud said he had been hopeful that the delegation would succeed in ridding the city of insurgents. </p> <p>\"I hope they can succeed and can take them away from Fallujah as soon as possible, or otherwise we're preparing ourselves to smash them ... by military means,\" he added.</p> <p>Elsewhere, a car bomb exploded today near a police station in south-west Baghdad, killing one person and injuring at least 11 others, according to the interior ministry and hospital officials. </p> <p>Interior ministry spokesman Colonel Adnan Abdul-Rahman said initial reports indicated that five policemen were among those injured in the explosion. The attack took place close to a police station, but the target may have been a patrol nearby, he added. \"There were patrols there; they could have been the target.\"</p>",
  "A condemned dog was today granted a last minute reprieve by a judge, more than three years after being ordered to be put down for biting a woman. <p>Dino, a seven-year-old German shepherd, was placed under a destruction order by magistrates in July 2001 after attacking a woman who attempted to intervene in a fight between him and her pet terrier. </p> <p>However, an unprecedented legal campaign - costing an estimated \u00a360,000 - by Dino's owner, Bryan Lamont, resulted in the reversal of the order today.</p> <p>Judge Patrick Eccles QC, sitting at Northampton crown court, ruled that Dino should be allowed to live, and praised Mr Lamont's tenacity. \"A dog will have his day, said the bard, and Mr Lamont's devotion has allowed Dino to have his day,\" the judge said. </p> <p>\"If a Scotsman with deep pockets and spirit takes on the judiciary to vindicate his dog, the contest is likely to be vigorous and prolonged.\" </p> <p>Dino was sentenced to death after biting the hand of Elizabeth Coull as she attempted to separate him from her own pet terrier, Ralph. </p> <p>The Lamonts, of Barn Owl Close, East Hunsbury, Northampton, said the incident was a one-off, arguing that Dino was not a dangerous dog. </p> <p>But in July 2001, Mr Lamont admitted allowing Dino to be out of control in Grangewood Park, Northants, causing an injury to another dog owner. Magistrates in Northampton fined him \u00a3100 and ordered him to pay \u00a32,552 in compensation to Mrs Coull. </p> <p>Mr Lamont and his wife, Carol, launched a string of failed appeals to overturn the destruction order, which was imposed under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act.</p> <p>Their pet was temporarily saved from death when they resorted to a body set up to help people who have been victims of miscarriages of justice. </p> <p>The couple's legal battle saw Dino's case pass from Northampton magistrates court to Northampton crown court, the high court, the House of Lords and the European court of human rights. </p> <p>After exhausting all avenues in the courts, the Lamonts and their lawyers had one chance left - the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which was set up in 1995 to review suspected and alleged miscarriages of criminal justice in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. </p> <p>It was the first time the CCRC had looked into the case of a family pet. In its ruling, it referred the case back to Northampton crown court. </p> <p>Speaking after today's verdict Mr Lamont said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the result.</p>",
  "<p>Two of the UK's royal medical colleges today confirmed that they have dropped their opposition to a proposed law that would allow doctors to help terminally ill patients to die.</p> <p>The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) and the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) have both adopted a neutral stance to the assisted dying for the terminally ill bill, which, if enacted, would give legal protection for doctors assisting patients with voluntary euthanasia.</p> <p>The private members bill, introduced by Lord Joffe, is currently before the House of Lords select committee. It proposes a lifting of the UK ban on assisted dying to \"enable a competent adult who is suffering unbearably as a result of a terminal illness to receive medical assistance to die at his/her own considered and persistent request\".</p> <p>The RCP said it no longer opposed the bill because of amendments introduced, including better safeguards. </p> <p>Professor Raymond Tallis, chairman of the RCP's committee on ethical issues in medicine, said revisions to the bill narrowed the number of patients it would affect.</p> <p>He said: \"The main reason we shifted our position was because the bill itself has changed quite significantly. There are more safeguards - the requirement of full palliative care has been really spelt out.\"</p> <p>The professor added that British law needed to take account of the experience of other countries, such as Holland and Belgium, which have changed their laws to permit assisted dying in different ways. </p> <p>But he said there were still issues to do with doctor training and patient diagnosis which needed to be cleared up. </p> <p>The RCGP said more clarity was still needed on the bill. Dr Ivan Cox, the college's spokesman on euthanasia, who gave evidence to the select committee, said: \"It is clear that something needs to be done to clear up some of the ethical confusion surrounding end of life issues.</p> <p>\"At this stage we still have major concerns over definitions such as diagnosis and terminality and ask who would carry out these assisted suicides. Significant training resources would have to be provided for doctors to implement such a policy correctly.\"</p> <p>The British Medical Association remains opposed to the private members bill. </p> <p>But the move by the two royal colleges was welcomed by the Voluntary Euthanasia Society. A spokesman said: \"It is momentous. It shows medical opinion is changing. Doctors are beginning to look at issues more carefully and consider them on their merits. I think a lot of doctors do support the proposals.\"</p>",
  "<p>A brilliant 155 by Virender Sehwag put India in a commanding position at the close of the second day of the second Test against Australia in Chennai - despite Shane Warne becoming the leading wicket-taker in Test cricket.</p> <p>Warne claimed his 533rd wicket during the morning session to move ahead of Sri Lankan rival Muttiah Muralitharan when he had Irfan Pathan caught at slip by Matthew Hayden for 14.</p> <p>Sehwag waged a lone battle on the second day as Warne led a fightback to reduce India to 291 for six in reply to the touring side's first innings of 235.

  "<p>PS2, Xbox, GameCube, PC, \u00a339.99 Electronic Arts Sports<br> *** </p> <p> Fifa Football 2004 was EA Sports' nadir.

  "The Democratic challenger, John Kerry, emerged yesterday from the third and final televised debate with enhanced credentials, as he and George Bush moved into the last phase of the campaign. <p>Polls taken shortly after Wednesday night's debate in Arizona between Mr Kerry and President Bush gave the challenger the spoils for the third successive time. But an ABC poll last night put overall ratings level at 48% each. </p> <p>The Bush camp sought to wrest back the initiative. In a campaign stop in Nevada yesterday, the president attacked the Democrats' interventionist promises, as Dick Cheney, the vice-president, rebuked Mr Kerry for mentioning his daughter Mary Cheney, a lesbian, during a debate discussion on gay rights. </p> <p>\"You saw a man who will do and say anything to get elected, and I am not just speaking as a father here, although I am a pretty angry father,\" said Mr Cheney yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Kerry mentioned Mr Cheney's daughter during the debate when asked whether being gay was a choice. </p> <p>\"We're all God's children,\" he said. \"And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, who she was born as.\" </p> <p>Lynne Cheney, the vice-president's wife, accused Mr Kerry of playing politics with her family and denounced his response as a \"cheap and tawdry political trick\". </p> <p>\"This is not a good man,\" she told a post-debate rally. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Mr Kerry came out of the televised showdown with the upper hand. A CNN poll of 500 voters immediately afterwards showed a 52% to 39% split in favour of Mr Kerry. A CBS poll gave the challenger a 39% to 25% advantage. </p> <p>\"This was the knockout punch,\" said Terry McAuliffe, a Kerry adviser. \"The swing voters are not going to move until after the four debates. I think now you are going to see a huge movement.\" </p> <p>But the Bush camp said it had always expected a tight race. \"The president was confident, Senator Kerry was dour and defensive,\" said Ken Mehlman, the Bush campaign manager. \"It's going to be hard for anyone to have a big lead in the polls.\" </p> <p>As expected, Mr Bush painted his opponent as a tax-and-spend liberal who was out of touch with the American people. </p> <p>On the eve of the first debate Mr Bush held an 11% lead but yesterday, with just 19 days until polling day on November 2, that lead had evaporated. </p> <p>The 90-minute final debate, in which the candidates answered questions from a moderator, followed a pattern: Mr Bush talked in terms of big ideals, Mr Kerry tried to nail the incumbent on his record. </p> <p>Mr Bush attempted to engage the audience with jokes which fell flat in the formal setting and steered clear of discussing specifics and his record. </p> <p>Mr Kerry tried to erase his reputation as a wordy policy wonk by looking at the camera to deliver firm, short answers, but old habits tripped him up at times, particularly during an extended answer on the outsourcing of US jobs overseas. </p> <p>As with every debate, a moment arrived when the two men were given an opportunity to show their human sides. </p> <p>Asked by the moderator, the CBS news presenter Bob Schieffer, what they had learned from the strong women in their families, Mr Bush, referring to criticisms of his performance in the first debate, said: \"To listen to them. To stand up straight and not scowl.\" </p> <p>The comments drew the first laughter of the evening. </p> <p>Mr Kerry responded to the same question by talking about his mother. But he also showed a self-deprecating side. \"I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up,\" he said to Mr Schieffer. </p> <p>\"And,\" he added, in reference to his marriage to the heiress to the Heinz fortune, \"some would say maybe me more so than others.\" </p> <p>A question about federal spending and deficits yielded one of the sharpest exchanges. </p> <p>\"You know, there's a mainstream in American politics, and you sit right on the far left bank,\" Mr Bush said, accusing his opponent of voting to exceed budget ceilings 277 times. </p> <p>\"Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country,\" Mr Kerry responded, referring to the TV mafia boss. \"This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.\" </p> <p>Domestic issues, ranging from healthcare to the debt burden to social security reform, dominated the evening. </p> <p>The answers to a question about abortion rights gave perhaps the clearest indication that the two candidates do offer different visions for the US. </p> <p>Asked whether he would like to overturn Roe v Wade, the supreme court decision that established the legal right to abortion, Mr Bush answered: \"I will not have a litmus test. I will pick judges who will interpret the constitution, but I'll have no litmus test.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry said\"the right of choice is a constitutional right. So I don't intend to see it undone _ Clearly the president wants to leave it in ambivalence or intends to undo it.\" </p> <p>In his most eloquent passage of the evening, Mr Bush said: \"Prayer and religion sustain me. </p> <p>\"I receive calmness in the storms of the presidency. But when I make decisions, I stand on principle, and the principles are derived from who I am.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry replied: \"Frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbour to do in this country and on this planet.\"</p>",
  "When I met Zaneb in Brighton during the Labour party conference she could only walk with the help of crutches. One of her legs had been amputated after she and the children with whom she was playing were caught in the bombing around Basra at the time of the invasion. Seventeen members of her extended family were killed that day, including her mother. <p>It is a characteristic of modern, aerial warfare that it leaves behind more casualties among civilians than among combatants; and in a developing country such as Iraq where half the population is under 14, many of them will be children. Any decision to go to war, in full knowledge of the casualties that will follow, therefore has to be born out of necessity and built on cast-iron certainty. The awful truth that is now clear is that the Iraq war was not necessary and was based, in the Joint Intelligence Committee's own words, on \"sporadic and patchy\" intelligence which has turned out to be wholly false. </p> <p>The formal admission this week that the 45-minute claim was bunkum comes 18 months too late to save Zaneb and her family, or to influence the vote on war in parliament. Whitehall knew long before that vote that much of the intelligence in the September dossier was unsound. They knew because Hans Blix and his inspectors had visited sites it identified and drawn a blank. They knew because SIS had already developed doubts about the credibility of the source of the 45-minute claim. Andrew Gilligan was only in error about timescale when he claimed Whitehall knew that intelligence in the September dossier was wrong. They did not know it at the time of its publication, but they did know when they asked parliament for authority for war. </p> <p>The political dilemma for Downing Street is that it desperately wants the nation to move on from the controversy over the origins of the war, but is also determined to avoid anyone taking the rap. Yet it is impossible to see how the government can achieve closure on the biggest blunder since Suez without first achieving a catharsis which attributes responsibility and apportions blame. </p> <p>At prime minister's questions, Tony Blair again pleaded the defence of good intentions - he acted in good faith but was misled by wrong information. This leaves a conundrum: why is he not more angry with those who misled him? John Smith, for example, would have been incandescent with an intelligence agency that had so badly misinformed him, and with a private office in Downing Street that apparently did not ask elementary questions, such as whether they were talking about battlefield or strategic weapon systems. Tony Blair is curiously indulgent to all those who led him into the most damaging episode of his premiership. We even read that all the key players in preparing the false prospectus for war are to be rewarded in a special honours list. A parade of the relevant officials down Whitehall in sackcloth and ashes would provide a more convincing demonstration that Downing Street is really sorry. </p> <p>There is another awkward question that has become more acute with each new revelation, and which will not go away until it is answered. What does the government now think was the legal basis for war? </p> <p>The initial opinion of the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, was that invasion would require a second UN resolution. This was an opinion that he only revisited when it became evident that there would be no second resolution. At this point Elizabeth Wilmshurst, the deputy legal adviser to the Foreign Office, resigned and subsequently protested that \"the conflict in Iraq was contrary to international law\". This week we learned that two other colleagues resigned along with her, which must have left a lot of empty desks in the legal department. </p> <p>The attorney general himself still appeared unsure of his ground, but his dilemma was eased by the suggestion from Downing Street that he outsourced the drafting of his opinion to a law professor with a record of support for war. As a result the nation went to war against the advice of Whitehall's experts in international law and on the strength of an opinion from a professor at the LSE. </p> <p>The government has resisted publishing the text that resulted, presumably because even it would reveal awkward reservations and legal quibbles, but a precis was produced as a parliamentary answer. What is striking is the centrality that disarmament plays in it as the justification for war. Thus Iraq is held to be in material breach of the ceasefire resolution because it had not fulfilled \"its obligations to disarm\". There is a logical, inescapable conclusion from this chain of reasoning. If Iraq had in reality fulfilled its disarmament obligation there was no legal authority for the invasion. </p> <p>Tony Blair appeared conscious of this problem when he answered questions this week. He does not now rely on the need to disarm Iraq, but on other breaches by Saddam of UN resolutions. But the only breach that could have justified a war would have been failure to disarm. To be sure, Saddam was in breach of his obligation to keep proper paperwork on the destruction of his chemical and biological weapons, but that hardly justifies an intensive bombing campaign and a ground invasion by a quarter of a million troops. Any international court would be certain to rule by its first coffee break that such a response was not legitimate when weighed against the twin tests of proportionality and necessity. We are left with the unsettling conclusion that the legal case for the war collapses among the rubble of false intelligence in the same way as the political justification. </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith is a decent, able lawyer. It may be that he was just as duped as parliament by the assurances from Downing Street that the evidence of the intelligence was much firmer than it has turned out to be. Maybe they also withheld from him the growing evidence from the UN inspections that our intelligence was simply wrong. If so, the attorney general owes it to himself, never mind the rest of us, to state what would have been his opinion on the legality of the war if he had been given the true facts. It may be prudent on his part to prepare a revised opinion, as now it can only be a matter of time before the legality of the war is challenged in the British or international courts. </p> <p>Does the legality of the war still matter over a year after the event? The only responsible answer must be yes. </p> <p>In the first place we are still struggling with the legacy of our decision to conquer Iraq and the incompetence of an occupation that has compounded the original misjudgment. Iraq may have been no threat to us at the time of the war, but we have certainly turned it into one as a base for international terrorism. Instead of delivering a modern Iraq as a model for the region, we have made Iraq a source of instability in a Middle East that looks much more precarious than two years ago. </p> <p>But it also matters because the fabric of orderly relations between nations, the strength of human rights law and cooperation against terrorism are built on respect for international law. We cannot demand that respect from other nations if we ourselves do not give it a higher priority than we appear to have done in reaching our decision to go to war in Iraq. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:r.cook@theguardian.com\">r.cook@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<b>Terrorist groups</b> <br> The assets of the terrorist group behind the kidnap and murder of British Iraq hostage Ken Bigley have been frozen, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced. <p>Mr Brown said he had \"today instructed the Bank of England to freeze with immediate effect the assets of JTJ, the terrorist group which publicly admitted involvement in the murders of Kenneth Bigley and five other hostages and has perpetrated a range of terrorist acts across Iraq\". </p> <p>The chancellor said: \"We are working with international partners to deny JTJ access to funds across the world. We must do all in our power to ensure there is no hiding place for terrorists and no hiding place for those who finance terrorism.\" </p> <p><b>Small businesses</b><br> A boost for small businesses, offering bigger loans to fund expansion plans, was announced by Mr Brown. For firms less than three-years-old with turnovers of \u00a35.6m or less, loans under the small business guarantee scheme will increase from a maximum of \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3250,000, he said. The loans will be administered by an independent company \"at arms length from government\". </p> <p><b>Royal security</b><br> The government is giving \"anxious attention\" to the possibility of making it a criminal offence to trespass on certain Royal sites, Home Office minister Lady Scotland said amid heightened concern about security after a Fathers4Justice protester scaled Buckingham Palace last month. She said: \"There may be a strong argument for introducing a specific offence of criminal offence, just in relation to the Queen's premises and perhaps certain other security sites.\" </p> <p><b>Gambling</b><br> A controversial bill to modernise gambling laws will be introduced ahead of the Queen's speech next month, it was confirmed. Legislation to extend rights and protections for people with disabilities will also be unveiled before November 23, the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, told MPs. The move comes under measures intended to make it easier to carry legislation over from one session to the next. </p> <p><b>Westminster security</b><br> The apparent leak of a parliamentary committee's decision to shake up security at Westminster was condemned by senior Tory Sir Patrick Cormack. His comments came after an article in the Times stated that the Joint Committee on Security agreed to appoint a new head of security for the Commons and Lords, a move which would see police and MI5 take over running parliament's security. </p> <p>Mr Hain said the Commons commission would be discussing the points raised. He added: \"I take in general terms the point that you make, that we cannot operate, especially in this very sensitive area of house security, without some trust and confidence among ourselves.\" </p> <p><b>MPs' expenses</b><br> Repeated pleas for media understanding and responsibility were made ahead of next week's publication of MPs' expenses. The list will be published at 3.30pm next Thursday on the parliament website, Mr Hain announced. It will provide a breakdown of expenses claimed for staffing, additional costs allowance or London supplement and travel. </p> <p>For the Liberal Democrats, Paul Tyler cautioned: \"We hope you are not being over-optimistic in assuming that the media will not indulge in misrepresentation and misunderstanding.\" Mr Hain said he hoped journalists would act responsibly, adding: \"In all the categories of expenses that will be available for inspection by our constituents they are all to do with our work here as MPs.\" </p> <p><b>GCSE results</b><br> The GCSE results of pupils at state schools which specialise in sport are improving twice as fast as the average, schools minister Stephen Twigg said. He told MPs 48.7% achieved five or more good passes last year, up from just 41% in 1997. For the Tories, Hugh Robertson said hard-pressed teachers would need extra incentives to return to coaching school teams. </p> <p><b>EU crime cooperation</b><br> Closer cooperation with EU nations on fighting crime and managing asylum will not undermine British sovereignty, Home Office minister Caroline Flint insisted. She attacked Tory claims that the proposals would mean the UK losing control of its borders as \"myths and distortions\". </p> <p>European commission proposals to give pan-EU police force Europol investigatory powers and create a joint public prosecutor would be resisted, she pledged. </p> <p><b>Medicinal cannabis</b><br> A call by Labour's Peter Bradley for cannabis to be made available immediately as a pain-relieving medicine for multiple sclerosis sufferers was rejected by Ms Flint. She insisted it would be \"premature\" to do so when a cannabis-based treatment was still being considered by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency watchdog. However she said she hoped a \"safe but speedy\" decision would be made on licensing of Sativex - testing of which has been hit by delays. </p> <p><b>Foreign Office travel costs</b><br> The cost to the taxpayer of chartering a plane for foreign secretary Jack Straw's recent trip to Sudan was \u00a3116,300, it emerged. The total cost for August's return trip via Sudan and Kenya was \u00a3168,000. Accompanying media contributed \u00a351,700 to the cost, Mr Straw told the shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram. </p> <p><b>Lib Dem peers</b><br> Lord McNally was returned unopposed as the next leader of the Liberal Democrat peers, succeeding Lady Williams. Lord McNally, a former adviser to Labour prime minister James Callaghan, defected from Labour to join the breakaway SDP founded by Shirley Williams and others in 1981. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>Backbench business in the Commons includes Lords amendments to the Christmas Day (trading) bill and the report stages of the crown employment (nationality) bill and the sex discrimination (clubs and other private associations) bill. The Lords is not sitting.</p>",
  "Millions of Americans are scratching their heads over how to vote on November 2 after the last of the three televised presidential debates left George Bush and John Kerry neck and neck over jobs, education, health care and taxes, with little mention of Iraq or 9/11. But the rest of the world, according to a poll we and several other newspapers publish today, has already made up its mind, backing the Democratic challenger by a margin of two to one. <p>Any sample, of course, is just a sample, but this survey of public opinion in 10 countries does include the US's two immediate neighbours, Canada and Mexico, as well as Israel and Russia, Washington's close allies in the \"war on terror\", and Britain, still its most loyal transatlantic friend, despite widespread criticism of Tony Blair. Unfortunately, Muslim countries are absent, though their inclusion would have made even gloomier reading for the White House. A recent Pew Research Centre poll, for example, showed just 7% of Pakistanis approve of Mr Bush, while 65% have a favourable opinion of Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>These findings - likely to achieve a high degree of exposure because they are media-driven - confirm previous polls in underlining the degree of global hostility to President Bush and the Iraq war. Some 74% of Germans, according to GlobeScan, want to see Mr Kerry win the election. A June poll conducted by the German Marshall Fund found that 76% of respondents in nine European countries disapproved of Mr Bush's handling of international affairs, up significantly from a survey in 2002. It also found that 80% of Europeans polled - compared with half of Americans - said Iraq was not worth the human and financial cost. In Europe, only Poles would rather see Mr Bush back in the Oval office. Elsewhere in \"new Europe\" there is a distinctly \"old European\" wish to see the Massachusetts senator win. Further afield, Israelis are the only people to back the incumbent and to see American democracy as a model for other countries. Similarly positive views in Russia appear to reflect the hardline US view on Chechen terrorism: the survey was carried out in the aftermath of the Beslan school massacre. </p> <p>Against this bleak background, the good news is that there is a clear distinction between anti-Americanism and criticism of US policies. No less than 68% of all those polled - with the French, Mr Kerry's most fervent backers, scoring a surprising above-average 72% - have a favourable view of Americans but are implacably opposed to the US government. Opinions of the US have worsened for 57% over the past three years. </p> <p>Strikingly, though, political differences may now be casting shadows in other areas. Young Britons, avid consumers of Big Macs, Starbucks and Friends, are now hostile to American culture on a scale traditionally associated with the French. Canada, Mexico and South Korea feel even more threatened. It is common ground that Iraq and the Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Abu Ghraib scandals have eroded the sympathy generated by the 2001 terrorist attacks. Encouragingly for whoever does win, 90% believe it is important to maintain good relations with the US. The danger is, perhaps, of expecting too much from a Kerry victory. </p> <p>Mr Bush may well wish to exploit this hostility, against a rival he has portrayed as caring too much for allies and not enough for America. Clearly, if the world had a vote, the result on November 2 would not be in doubt. The president is unlikely to be surprised that the Guardian, Asahi Shimbun, Le Monde or El Pais believe that Iraq is a \"deadly and highly questionable war\". That though, is the view of the Lone Star Iconoclast, published in his home town of Crawford, Texas. It matters a lot what others think about the US. But it is only Americans who can choose their own leader.</p>",

  "<p>A ruling by five law lords yesterday makes it harder for the courts to stop publication of confidential material where disclosure is held to be in the public interest. </p> <p>The judges, headed by Lord Nicholls, unanimously agreed to lift an injunction against the Liverpool Echo preventing it publishing information from leaked documents alleged to show illegal and improper activity by the Cream Group of nightclub promoters. </p> <p>The case is the first to go to the lords for a definitive ruling on a section inserted in the Human Rights Act 1998 after lobbying by newspapers and broadcasters.

Ms Banerjee, who received no payment for the information, claimed the documents showed illegal and improper activity by the Cream Group. </p> <p>In June 2002 the Echo published articles about alleged corruption involving one director of the Cream group and a council official. In July the high court imposed an injunction banning further publication. </p> <p>The Echo took the case to the court of appeal, which upheld the injunction by a two-one majority. Yesterday the law lords lifted the ban, ruling that Cream was more likely to fail than succeed at trial. </p> <p>The case hinged on how \"likely to succeed\" should be interpreted: whether it meant there was a reasonable prospect of success, or, alternatively, the action was more likely to succeed than not. </p> <p>Lord Nicholls said the approach should be that courts would be \"exceedingly slow\" to make interim restraint orders where the applicant had not satisfied the court he was more likely than not to succeed at trial. </p> <p>But there would be cases where it was necessary for the court to depart from this approach, and a lesser degree of likelihood would be enough. Such circumstances included where the adverse consequences of disclosure were particularly grave (for example, someone's life at risk), or where a short-lived injunction was needed to enable the court to hear and consider an application pending trial. </p> <p>The Echo's editor, Mark Dickinson, said: \"This is a tremendous victory for press freedom.\" </p> <p>\"We have argued from day one that our readers have a right to know the information we have been given about Cream, and the story should be told in the public interest ... </p> <p>\"I think this ruling will be welcomed by newspapers up and down the land ... </p> <p>\"After the court of appeal decision, there was a significant increase in the number of solicitors seeking temporary injunctions for spurious reasons. Happily, that trend will now be reversed.\"</p>",
  "Earl Russell, who has died aged 67, was great-grandson of Lord John Russell, the architect of the 1832 Great Reform Bill, and son of Bertrand Russell, the philosopher and savant. It is no wonder that Conrad Russell, steeped in a sense of history, became a brilliant 17th-century historian. <p>He entered the House of Lords as the fifth Earl Russell after the death of his half-brother in 1987. He had the quirky distinction of being one of that rump of elected hereditaries who survived the cull of 1999. </p> <p>To describe Conrad as an eccentric is inadequate, though there was plenty of that about him. Those observing him speaking in the chamber from the Lords' visitors gallery might easily have been transported back to 1850: the courtesy of his manner and his honed, elegant use of English being of a piece with his hawkish, distinguished stoop. Anyone seeing him coming or going from the House in a crumpled suit carrying supermarket bags bulging with papers would have been forgiven for not recognising the same man. </p> <p>He was an opponent to beware of in debate and was ever a champion of the underdog, be he or she an asylum seeker or a widow trapped in the social security maze. He never let the House forget its great and ancient history, and could be relied upon to introduce an apt precedent - usually from the civil war era - to illuminate his argument. </p> <p>For example, already ill, he dragged himself into the House on May 4 last spring to continue the good fight against what he saw as inhumane provisions of the asylum and immigration bill. His contribution that day was studded with quotes from the MP for Knaresborough in the 17th-century Long Parliament, from Sir Thomas Wentworth (\"God deliver us from this arbitrary government\") and, to balance the verbal feast, a quote from Goldfinger rebuking James Bond. </p> <p>Conrad's lifelong concern for and empathy with young people, whether in the seminar room or on the campaign stump, could be seen as a reaction to his own bizarre and unhappy upbringing. As he warned me, \"Watch out for family issues. My own marriage was the first in the family to last \"til death us do part' since 1864.\" And it is true, his marriage with Elizabeth, one of his former pupils, was integral to the contentment he did achieve in adult life. </p> <p>As the only child of Bertrand's third marriage to Patricia Spence, having only spasmodic contact with children of his own age and a largely unhappy schooling until he went to Eton, Conrad was caught up in the malign chemistry of his parents' relationship, which ended when he was 11 in a way that traumatised him for life. Every day thereafter, he insisted, he could not get going in the mornings until he had ritually girded himself against those ghosts. </p> <p>Prior to that the three of them had lived in the US for much of the second world war, in relatively straitened and isolated circumstances. In fact he got on well with his overpowering father who, at least to him, was not self-centred, yet not one to whom a son could go for practical advice. Conrad loved recalling Bertrand's summoning \"a footman\" from his sick bed, an age after that reality. </p> <p>At Eton, under Robert Birley, he felt quickly at home, an oddball among oddballs. A real high point of his life was becoming \"keeper of the wall\", which made him captain of games and one to whom, therefore, the real sporting toffs had to defer. He also contracted there his love of cricket which, with swimming, is described as his recreation in Who's Who. </p> <p>It was at Merton College Oxford, from which he graduated in 1958, that he really came into his own, socially as well as intellectually, stimulated by three exceptional men, Ralph Davis, Roger Highfield and John Roberts. By then he was a compulsive conversationalist and controversialist and took to the Union. Ideas, openly and generously debated, were his staple ever after, though small talk never a forte. One of his contemporaries remembers scrumming with him in the second row of Merton's second XV and being rebuked by the front row for talking too much, and of Conrad pacing his room into the small hours redelivering by rote great speeches of Sir Edward Cooke, John Pym and other of his political heroes. </p> <p>All this was a blessed relief from the years trapped between warring parents, and it was out of the misery of that time that he twice attempted suicide. Only at Oxford did he realise that people liked him which, he recollected, \"was quite a shock\". </p> <p>The 1970s and 1980s were dominated by his academic advancement and authorship of a series of esteemed books, mostly about Stuart England. Always suspicious of the doctrinaire and the \"grand sweep\" which rode over unaccommodating and often conflicting reality, Conrad retained a dogged regard for original sources, and a mind ever open to the facts. Of all his works he will probably be most remembered for The Fall Of British Monarchies 1637-1642 (1991) which, some think, permanently shifted the interpretation of that period. </p> <p>He was a committed, conscientious and inspiring teacher. From 1960 to 1974 he was a lecturer in history at London University's Bedford College, and a reader until 1979 when he became professor of history at Yale University where he was remembered inter alia for his \"English-exoticness\". From 1984 he was Astor professor of British history at University College London , and from 1990 to 2002, professor of British history at King's College London. En route he was Sir Henry Savile research professor at his own college in Oxford, delivered the Ford lectures at Oxford (1987-88), and wrote and lectured voluminously. </p> <p>The academic event which most gratified him was the publication in 2002 of a set of essays, Politics, Religion And Popularity, to celebrate his contribution to history. Besides being edited by professors from the universities of California and Princeton and by Dr Richard Cust from Birmingham University, the 12 other contributors reflect the academic cream of his period. The preface refers to his \"intellectual presence and his stature as a scholar\" and his enhancing approach to students and collaborators. </p> <p>In politics Conrad was, as Shirley Williams puts it, \"a liberal in every fibre of his being\". Although his affiliations veered between Liberal and Labour more than once, and although his only parliamentary contest was in 1966 for Labour, he finally returned to the party of his forefathers in 1974, and had been an unflagging activist for it ever since. </p> <p>It was typical of Conrad that last year, health already impaired, he threw himself into the by-election to elect the young Sarah Teather as member of parliament for Brent East. It is no less typical that he was as happy stuffing envelopes as drafting press releases. </p> <p>Conrad spawned affectionate anecdotes wherever he went, whether retailed by history students, aspiring politicos or, indeed, his peers. His integrity, humanity, acuity and shy warmth will dog his memory. </p> <p><b>Michael White</b> writes: When Conrad Russell turned up in the then-Liberal whips office after succeeding his halfbrother to the Russell earldom in 1987 the party could scarcely believe its luck. Political friends and opponents knew that this revisionist historian of the English civil war had also written books on liberalism and worked from a mixture of first principles and evidence-based analysis. But he was also a Russell, heir to more than 300 years at the centre of English political life.</p> <p>Mark Bonham-Carter, another Liberal dynast in the Lords, used to say that \"listening to Conrad you could be listening to Lord John Russell. You felt the Russells must always have sounded like that.\" </p> <p>Despite his brilliance and his passion for social policy, laced with insights into Elizabethan poor law, he was also guilty of clever peoples' severe lapses of judgment. As such, he backed the then-Taunton MP, Jackie Ballard's bid for the Liberal Democrat leadership in 1999 after Paddy Ashdown stepped down and Charles Kennedy was all but certain to win. </p> <p>An improbable spin doctor, Russell once drew for me a diagram showing how Ms Ballard would win on the seventh round. She didn't. </p> <p>Russell had a loud, infectious laugh, and some endearingly impractical habits which made women motherly, though they knew he was devoted to his late wife. </p> <p>He married Elizabeth Sanders in 1962, and she died in 2003. He leaves two sons, Nicholas (Viscount Amberley) and John. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell (Fifth Earl Russell), historian and politician, born April 15 1937; died October 14 2004</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> Not since we heard that Daily Mail lay preacher Paul Johnson had a disciplinarian friend named Gloria has a story moved us in the same way as news that Bill O'Reilly, barkingly rightwing face of Rupert Murdoch's Fox News, is being sued for sexual harassment by one of his producers. Bill, naturally, is suing right back for extortion, infliction of emotional distress (at least now he knows how his guests feel), and some contractual breach. Anyway, the daily talking points memo he sends out to viewers as yet neglects to address the one point everyone's talking about, but those keen to catch up should visit the smoking gun website for a romp through the court papers. From the detail contained in the deposition, we're assuming his erstwhile colleague taped some of his calls - because really, you'd have to have a great memory for where the gasps came, not to mention details like Bill getting so involved in some ablutions fantasy that he says felafel instead of loofah.

  "Chaos reigned as an estimated 10,000 people converged in London for the third European social forum with delays, frustration and problems at three venues. <p>Despite a welcome from Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London, who praised the forum's diversity, many visitors were bemused by a lack of organisation, which reflected badly on a capital bidding for the Olympic Games. </p> <p>The chaos began early when 6,000 of the mainly young people attending the three-day forum (ESF) had to queue for many hours in the rain to register and collect passes at the Conway Hall in central London. Because only 900 are allowed in at a time, the police were called to clear the premises. Fights ensued, and a man was arrested. </p> <p>\"Things got out of control. We were invaded by the Socialist Workers party,\" said Mary Fee, spokeswoman for the Solidarity village, an \"autonomous space\" at the hall hoping to set up an alternative currency for participants. </p> <p>As organisers announced that the Israeli whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu would address a meeting tomorrow, Mr Livingstone denied that the forum was being taken over by British leftist groups. </p> <p>\"The ESF is far too big and diverse to be swamped by any one viewpoint,\" he said. \"The global justice movement will be reflected in the different debates and speakers.\" </p> <p>The gathering gets into gear today and is expected to attract 1,000 groups, 350 of them British. The first two forums, in Florence and Paris, each attracted 50,000 participants. The Guardian is the forum's media partner. </p> <p>However, criticisms of logis-tics dominated the discussions which started last night at Southwark cathedral with the formal opening by Mr Livingstone, Che Guevara's daughter, Aleida, Gerry Adams, and others. </p> <p>Frustrations seethed over as more than 1,500 people were kept waiting in the rain and then refused entry to hear the opening speeches. </p> <p>And earlier hundreds who made their way to Alexandra Palace in north London, the venue for many of the 2,000 events, found only security guards and workmen. </p> <p>\"There is not one sign anywhere. The shuttle buses are not working. It seems there is no organisation,\" said Juan Blanco, a Spanish doctor. \"No one knows what is going on. Compared to Paris this stinks.\" </p> <p>But as some battled with transport, others were de-lighted by the vast choice. \"I have never seen such a programme,\" said Roberto, who arrived from Spain yesterday. </p> <p>\"This is like the Olympics of politics and culture, a cross between the Edinburgh Festival and the Paris Commune. There is too much for three days, but this is a good sign for social justice in Europe. The movement is vibrant.\" </p> <p>Back at Southwark, Mr Livingstone said: \"We expect 20- 30,000 delegates. In the last few days the media has woken up to the ESF. I know that because my press officers have been inundated with calls asking 'How much will it cost?' </p> <p>\"I tell you this, it will cost less than the G8 or last year's arms fair in London,\" he said to loud cheers. </p> <p>And he offered a warning, claiming that Saddam Hussein's decision to sell Iraqi oil in euros rather than dollars \"precipitated\" the US decision to topple him. </p> <p>\"Within my life time there will be a challenge against the dollar. China will emerge and say 'Why should we trade in dollars?' It will be the most dangerous time in world history.\" </p> <p>He told the crowds - as he introduced Ms Guevera - that in 2008 London would celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Cuban revolution. </p> <p>Ms Guevera received a standing ovation and said: \"Socialism is still a possibility and solidarity is of paramount importance.

  "When I arrive in Britain on Wednesday morning the headlines all announce the woeful state of British pensions. By evening, I discover that not many Britons are aware that tens of thousands of thinkers and activists from across Europe and beyond gather this week in London for the third European Social Forum (ESF). These two observations seem connected. Neo-liberalism, which officially began here with Mrs Thatcher, has not yet finished its dirty work. As Wednesday's headlines show, it is still bent on destroying hard-earned rights - sorry, \"privileges\". Many people seem to take this for granted and consider all resistance futile. <p>When the social forum concept was first launched in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2000 it was meant to provide a counterweight to that neo-liberal festival, the annual World Economic Forum in Davos. The idea was fruitful and duly multiplied, hiving off smaller replicas of itself in various cities, regions and continents. In the process, the Davos crowd has tended to be forgotten, sometimes even shrugged off as irrelevant by those who proclaim that \"another world is possible\". </p> <p>But Davos, the people who hobnob there, and the institutions they represent, have not gone away. Their ideology, money and rules still dominate the world, creating ever greater social inequalities, destroying democracy and leading us all towards planetary collapse. \"Globalisation\", a word invented to convey the false hope of an integrated, inclusive world, has in reality meant the opposite: the rejection and exclusion of hundreds of millions who contribute little or nothing to production and consumption and are thereby considered useless by 21st-century capitalism. </p> <p>ESF participants utterly oppose the Davos view of \"globalisation\". The challenge they face is deadly serious. It deserves the best strategic thinking they can muster in order to mobilise effectively against powerful adversaries, to alter the present balance of forces and ultimately, yes, to change the world. </p> <p>So far, social forums have fulfilled the goal of providing a space for discussion and confrontation of points of view; they have supplied the citizens' movement with cogent analysis and come up with a good many concrete proposals. Without the first ESF (Florence, November 2002) and the World Social Forum of Porto Alegre two months later, the spectacular, unprecedented and worldwide mass mobilisation against the Bush/Blair war in Iraq could never have happened. Although the mass movement didn't succeed in stopping the war (nothing could have done that), it did earn the New York Times accolade of \"the second superpower\". That's quite an achievement for a movement barely five years old, if one counts from Seattle in November 1999. </p> <p>We now need to apply the same passion and determination to battles which, unlike the one against the Iraq war, we can actually win. Each participant has his or her own list; mine would include international taxation and redistribution, cancellation of third world debt; getting rid of genetically manipulated organisms; and saving public services, health and education from the clutches of the World Trade Organisation. The list is long, but do-able. </p> <p>What we no longer need are ritual denunciations and constant reminders from the platform that we are in favour of some things (social justice, human rights, democracy, ecological responsibility...) and against others (war, poverty, racism, global warming...). Reiteration of these themes has become the primary function of over-abundant ESF plenary sessions. I cannot imagine any Davos Masters of the Universe quaking in their boots as a result of these ceremonial activities. </p> <p>The Porto Alegre World Social Forum in 2005 will take the welcome step of eliminating the plenary star-system altogether in order to concentrate exclusively on seminars and workshops. The role of a social forum should be to identify groups worldwide working on similar issues and place them in contact well before the event so that they can set their own agendas and, when they arrive, hit the ground running. This is the way to win. </p> <p>People from all over the world have been invited to London, but we should keep in mind that this is primarily the European Social Forum, and Europe just now has a lot on its plate. How many Europeans, including those attending the ESF, have ever heard of the Bolkestein directive, a noxious EU proposal which conveniently invents a whole raft of new legal concepts like \"the country of origin\"? A firm providing any service has only to set up its headquarters in one of the 25 EU countries - Slovenia, say - and, hey presto, Slovenia's social and labour legislation will apply to that company's activities throughout the EU. The \"receiving\" country will no longer have even the right to know what firms have set up shop on its territory - the responsibility for surveillance will be exclusively Slovenia's, and the said firms can also \"import\" labour from anywhere so long as they have a residence permit in, you guessed it, Slovenia. </p> <p>I am myself a convinced European but I cannot vote for the proposed constitution which would enshrine the competitive free market as the heart of Europe's identity, exclude all mention of solidarity and cooperation; make subservience to Nato mandatory and render all its provisions irreversible for decades. </p> <p>The EU trade commissioner has given wholehearted support to the WTO, including the services agreement (Gats) whose ultimate goal is to turn all human needs and activities into commodities. I fear ESF participants may learn little about such scandalous subjects - wilfully complicated by the authorities to make opposition more difficult - and most of them will leave London no more equipped to fight against them than when they arrived. </p> <p>We need therefore to take seriously the \"E\" in ESF, improve our alliances and determine ways to combine our forces. Whereas the South has undergone decades of \"structural adjustment\", better known as austerity and destruction of all social services, most Northerners are only starting to understand that neo-liberal policies apply to them as well. The assault against European citizens, against the welfare state, even against social cohesion, is well advanced. Everything gained by people's struggles over the past 100 years is once more up for grabs. The ESF does not have the luxury of time to be side-tracked. </p> <p>The neo-liberal ideal stresses individual responsibility, freedom for business and market solutions; it affirms that private is always better than public, that people \"get what they deserve\". We propose instead the rule of law to curb the insatiable appetites of transnational corporations and financial markets; social solidarity with the poor and weak wherever they may live; and participatory democracy as the means to defend and improve the \"welfare model\". </p> <p>At the ESF, as in every other social forum, we should cease ritual, repetitive complaining about the ills of the world and, rather, take the time to examine power coldly, determine its strategic weaknesses and decide, together, how to push our neo-liberal adversaries back until at last they fall over the edge of the political cliff. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Susan George is associate director of the Transnational Institute; her most recent book is Another World Is Possible If ... </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tni.org/george\">www.tni.org/george</a></p>",

  "Two years ago, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child called for the creation of independent institutions across the UK to monitor, promote and protect children's human rights. In a green paper, Every Child Matters, the government duly promised England's 11 million children a champion independent of government. (Children in other countries of the UK already had, or were soon to have, children's commissioners.) Children's rights campaigners were delighted. <p>But the cheers died down with the publication of the children bill in March this year. Children in England looked set to get the weakest commissioner in Europe, with no independent powers and an incredibly weak function, ie promoting awareness of children's views and interests. As the bill passed through the Lords, the commissioner's powers were improved considerably. But that is not the end of the story. </p> <p>This week the children bill began its detailed scrutiny in the Commons, and the government has reversed many of the positive changes. On Tuesday, the country's first ever children's minister, Margaret Hodge, managed to get five references to children's rights removed from the bill. </p> <p>Hodge says she doesn't want a children's commissioner who will police individual rights. But nobody is asking for that. The role of a commissioner is to expose shortcomings in the treatment of children when they occur, and to seek to protect their human rights. And there is much protecting to be done. </p> <p>Take juvenile justice. The Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2002 noted the UK's extremely low age of criminal responsibility and urged the government to increase it \"considerably\". The law allows children from the age of 10 to be tried in adult courts and to be imprisoned. Before Robert Thompson and Jon Venables could appear in court in 1993, a carpenter had to build a block on the witness stand so the two boys could see the courtroom. </p> <p>The European court of human rights in Strasbourg recently heard a case of an English 11-year-old tried in an adult crown court. A consultant clinical psychologist had advised the judge that the boy had a developmental age of between six and eight. Yet the judge continued with the proceedings, and an application to the court of appeal failed. The Strasbourg court ruled that his right to a fair trial had been breached. </p> <p> Two children have died in custody this year. Gareth Myatt, 15, died while being restrained in Hassockfield secure training centre, one of four privately run child prisons. When in opposition, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Blunkett voted against them. They preferred local authority secure children's homes, staffed by social workers. The other child was 14-year-old Adam Rickwood, the youngest person ever to die in custody. This takes the number of child deaths in custody since 1990 to 27. </p> <p>During the past year, 3,337 children assessed as too vulnerable for prison were, nevertheless, sent to young offender institutions. The Youth Justice Board aims to reduce the number of children in custody by 10% over the next three years. The international human rights standard is that children should only be imprisoned as a last resort, and for the shortest period possible. </p> <p>In this country, children can be locked up even if they have committed no crime. In June, 60 asylum-seeking children were held in immigration removal or \"reception\" centres. The government had an opportunity to end detention this year, as another asylum bill passed through parliament. But there was no softening of policy. Instead, a new offence has been introduced of entering the country without documents, carrying the same two-year prison sentence for children and adults. </p> <p>Then there is smacking. The government is allowing a free vote on fox hunting, but still refuses to allow its MPs to exercise their conscience on whether babies and children should have the same legal protection from being hit as adults. The first act of parliament protecting children from cruelty came 60 years after similar protective legislation for animals. So no change there. </p> <p>The convention on the rights of the child has the status of international law. But children cannot seek justice through the courts when their convention rights are breached. Apart from a trip to Geneva once every five years to account for its action on children's rights, a government can, if it chooses, ignore the rights of children. Which is why it is so important that children get a champion who has the political clout and independence to encourage, cajole and shame ministers into fulfilling their human rights obligations. Castrating the children's commissioner before he or she has even started is the ultimate snub. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Carolyne Willow is national coordinator of the Children's Rights Alliance for England </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:cwillow@crae.org.uk\">cwillow@crae.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Well away from television cameras, the media, and troublesome hunting supporters, John Prescott has spent the last three days on the campaign trail pushing his pet project. </p> <p>Microphone in one hand and leaflets in the other, he has hopped unannounced from cities to market towns with the message that England's most northerly region should chart its own destiny. </p> <p>Unscripted and sometimes off-message, he has mixed it with voters from Sunderland, to Consett and Hexham, occasionally throwing caution to the wind and railing against a Whitehall machine he clearly mistrusts. \"You've got an historic opportunity to take back control held by civil servants in London,\" he tells shoppers. \"The people in the north-east know more about their communities than anyone else, understand the problems and strengths of their area.\" </p> <p>But the slogan on Labour's white battle bus betrays a little nervousness in the run-up to the country's first regional devolution referendum, on which the deputy prime minister has staked considerable credibility: \"This is your chance - let's not waste it.\" </p> <p>In four days' time, 1.9 million electors will begin receiving voting papers for an all-postal referendum to determine whether the north-east should have an elected assembly, broadly similar to the Greater London authority. But Mr Prescott is still haggling with sceptical Cabinet colleagues over the powers it should have. </p> <p>More than anything, this is his grand project and a yes vote - counting takes place on November 4 - would crown a long political career in which he has often been a lone champion of English devolution. But three months ago he was forced to \"postpone\" plans for other referendums in the north-west and in Yorkshire after a rebellion by backbench Labour MPs. They feared a bruising devolution battle in marginal seats would undermine the party six months before a likely general election. </p> <p>Although Labour's old north-east heartland was seen as a safer bet, polls have shown that about a quarter of voters are undecided, with one survey in a local paper this week giving the nocampaign the edge. </p> <p>Mr Prescott will return to the stump next week in the knowledge that his project is resting on a knife-edge amid indications that the campaign is finally exciting the electorate. </p> <p>Referendum broadcasts began last night on regional television. The first, a four-minute offering from the North East Says No campaign (Nesno) - directed by an official from a rightwing London thinktank - unashamedly took its cue from negative US-style campaigning. Nesno has backing from the Tories and the UK Independence party. </p> <p>A series of images portrayed senior Labour MPs beside the headline \"Politicians have let us down\". It was followed with the exhortation \"Vote no to just more politicians\" and then \"Politicians talk, we pay\" - a reference to the costs of the proposed assembly. It will be able to place a levy on council taxpayers, initially around 5%. </p> <p>Although a north-east industrialist, John Elliott, chairs the nocampaign, it is led by James Frayne, campaign director of the New Frontiers Foundation, which describes itself as a \"free market think-tank which grew out of Business for Sterling\", the anti-euro campaign. </p> <p>Mr Elliott and Mr Frayne acknowledge that their opponents, the cross-party Yes for the North East campaign, have the slick publicity, and a string of local personalities. </p> <p>Featuring in the second broadcast tonight, they range from the ex-Olympic athlete Brendan Foster, to Sir John Hall, president of Newcastle United, Ray Mallon, the mayor of Middlesbrough and Steve Gibson, chairman of Middlesbrough FC. </p> <p>\"We have a very strong message and they've won the celebrity battle,\" Mr Frayne said. \"We are at war with a very well-funded establishment organisation, and they're playing with emotion - not facts.\" </p> <p>Ross Forbes, director of Yes for the North East, who lives near Newcastle and has worked in business and in the media, accuses his opponents of \"trading on fears\". He is not downhearted by the polls. \"It's perfectly winnable, but don't forget that this referendum is absolutely unprecedented. The cost of a no vote is very high. </p> <p>Across the region, debates have underlined a deep polarisation among electors. </p> <p>Sir John Hall, a key speaker, found it hard to contain his passion. \"There isn't anyone speaking up for this area, like Ken Livingstone in London,\" he thundered. \"The rest of the country is moving faster ahead than we are and we have to do something.\" </p> <p>Next week, on cue, Ken Livingstone is likely to join the call for a yes vote.</p>",
  "Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, yesterday dealt a blow to the government's anti-terrorist legislation by making it harder to prosecute under a law which makes membership of a proscribed terror organisation a criminal offence. <p>The law lords ruled that requiring defendants to prove that the organisation was not proscribed when they joined and that they had not taken part in its activities since it was proscribed - a reversal of the usual burden of proof - violated the presumption of innocence guaranteed by the European convention on human rights. </p> <p>By a three to two majority, the law lords in effect rewrote a provision in the 2000 Terrorism Act to remove the \"reverse burden of proof\". </p> <p>Lord Bingham, the senior law lord, who led the majority of three, said that while security considerations \"must always carry weight\", they did not absolve countries bound by the human rights convention \"from their duty to ensure that basic standards of fairness are observed\". </p> <p>Lawyers yesterday saw the ruling as a possible pointer to the outcome of the challenge now being considered by nine law lords to the lawfulness of Britain's opt-out from the convention allowing it to lock up foreign detainees suspected of terrorism indefinitely without trial. The judgment is expected within weeks. </p> <p>The nine-judge panel for that case was also headed by Lord Bingham, and included Lord Phillips, master of the rolls, who concurred with him yesterday. The third judge in the majority yesterday, Lord Steyn, stood down from the detainees' appeal because he had earlier expressed a view that the opt-out was unjustified. </p> <p>Lords Rodger and Carswell, who dissented yesterday, were also on the appeal panel. In their dissenting judgments yesterday, they pointed out that removing the reverse burden of proof would make it harder for successful prosecutions to be mounted. </p> <p>Yesterday's ruling was a defeat for the attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, who had asked the higher courts to clarify the burden of proof after a trial judge threw out a prosecution against a man named only as A, who was charged with being a member of Hamas IDQ, the military wing of the charitable organisation Hamas. </p> <p>The man had been heard to say \"I am Hamas\" more than once, but witnesses were uncertain whether he was joking. The trial judge said a jury could reasonably conclude that he was \"perhaps some latter-day Walter Mitty or Billy Liar\". </p> <p>The court of appeal ruled that the burden on the defendant to exonerate himself was a \"legal\" one, meaning that the burden was on him to prove his innocence once the prosecution had charged him. </p> <p>But the law lords held yesterday that the burden was only \"evidential\", meaning that once the defendant had raised an issue about his participation in the organisation's activities, the prosecution must prove that he had taken part. </p> <p>Lord Bingham said the membership provision could catch someone who was innocent of any blameworthy or properly criminal conduct, and if that person failed to offer proof of innocence, the court would have no choice but to convict him of an offence carrying a maximum 10-year prison sentence. </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said there had been very few prosecutions for the offence in question.</p>",
  "The law lords gave a green light yesterday to the use of evidence from phone taps in criminal trials, a move encouraged by David Blunkett, the home secretary, but of concern to the intelligence agencies. <p>In a unanimous opinion, five law lords said there was nothing in the European convention on human rights to stop such evidence being used in court provided the taps were properly authorised. </p> <p>More particularly they said that in law, there was no difference between private phone systems - notably, internal office extensions linked to a switchboard - and public systems such as BT networks. </p> <p>The law lords gave their opinion in response to a request by Lord Goldsmith, the attorney general. </p> <p>He sought their advice after a case involving allegations of police corruption collapsed following arguments about whether taps had been placed on an internal, private system or a public telephone system. </p> <p>This issue was one of the potential legal obstacles in the way of allowing the products of telephone taps to be used in criminal trials. </p> <p>The law prevents telephone tap evidence from being used in open court despite evidence from bugs in rooms, cars, or other premises, and video surveillance by the se curity and intelligence agencies, being allowed. </p> <p>\"The United Kingdom practice has been to exclude the product of warranted interception from the public domain and thus to preclude its use as evidence,\" the law lords said. </p> <p>\"But this has been a policy choice, not a requirement compelled by the [European human rights] convention.\" </p> <p>They said other European countries allowed such evidence to be produced in court, as did the US. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett told the Guardian last month that he wanted to lift the ban on using evidence from telephone taps which, he implied, would be used in terrorism cases in particular. </p> <p>\"I am much more won over to the idea of the use of [telephone] intercepts than I was 12 months ago and believe that it is feasible in certain circumstances,\" he said. </p> <p>MI5, the domestic security service, has been more relaxed about the use of such evidence in court than other agencies, including the police. </p> <p>Civil liberties groups and defence lawyers in general welcomed the move, one reason why all the security and intelligence agencies remain concerned about Mr Blunkett's plan. </p> <p>They said that it could lead to lengthy pre-trial arguments over disclosure and over whether, and how, transcripts of intercepted conversations had been edited.</p>",
  "He may have two legs rather than four, no bushy tail and prefer his chicken cooked, but no one in Britain has a better idea of what it is like to be a fox than Alun Michael. The rural affairs minister, who has shepherded the anti-hunting legislation through the Commons, has become the quarry of the angriest of foxhunters. <p>He has had to cancel meetings, change his social engagements and watch over his shoulder after one of the most vitriolic campaigns against a minister since the person in charge of ending free school milk became Thatcher - milk snatcher. Mr Michael is even featured on one pro-hunting website as Hitler. </p> <p>It may be raining heavily, but about 200 hunt supporters have turned out to picket a conference Mr Michael is attending in Maidstone in Kent. The sight of his car is greeted with the sound of hunting horns. There is a large police presence but the protest, this time, is mild and four pro-hunters are allowed into the hotel where Mr Michael is to address the conference of Ruralnet, a countryside regeneration charity. </p> <p>Sue Palmer, a farmer's wife covered with pro-hunting badges, tells him \"the fox will be wiped out if you ban hunting, it will be far crueller\". She says her farm relies on the hunt to control foxes and if the ban goes ahead, they will have to shoot the hounds, \"and we'll do it publicly\". </p> <p>Kerry, whose husband works for the local hunt and has a tied cottage, asks: \"How would your wife feel if she was about to be made homeless?\" She says her husband will be out of work at 50. Mr Michael responds that he has had, in the past, to talk to steel workers in his Cardiff constituency who have also been forced to retrain late in life. </p> <p>There is some cut-and-thrust between the two sides with Mrs Palmer saying it is a town versus country issue. The hunters leave saying \"you're not going to see us go away\". </p> <p><b>Warning</b><br> </p> <p>The first indication Mr Michael was going to be the pro-hunting lobby's main target came with the launch of the right to roam in mid-September. He was due to attend a celebratory rally in the Peak District but pulled out once it became clear there would be a demonstration against him. He said police had warned him there might be violence. The Countryside Alliance said he exaggerated the advice and quoted the local police as saying there had been no mention of violence, merely of protest. He disputes that. </p> <p>\"The police advice was very clear that my presence was going to lead to thousands of protesters turning up which would have hijacked and distorted the whole event and the police would have been hard put to guarantee the safety of the public,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Given that we had invited walkers, families, disabled youngsters to promote the inclusive nature of access it would have been to undo several years of very hard work and distort an event which was meant to celebrate nearly 100 years of campaigning. By absenting myself from that, I enabled the story to be the opening of the right to roam. There are difficulties to taking that decision because you get the distortion of 'oh, you are afraid to come' or you are somehow not welcome in the countryside, which is another of their pieces of sloganising.\" </p> <p>Later in September he cancelled plans to take part in the launch of a trust fund to promote Dorset's Jurassic coast, which included sailing around the coast, once it became clear that hunters would be present in large numbers. \"I thought it important to be there but not as important for me to enjoy a voyage along the coast in the Waverley, the paddle steamer which was intended to be the high point of the day,\" he says. </p> <p>\"The police were seriously concerned about policing an event on the seaside and on a vessel. The Countryside Alliance says in a cloyingly patronising way that 'it's a pity the minister for rural affairs isn't welcome in the countryside'. Well, I'm sorry, I found myself most welcome in the countryside. It is the minority of people who hunt who don't welcome me.\" </p> <p>Then, in Exeter, for the meeting of the National Parks Association, the hunters tracked Mr Michael down to a hotel and pelted him with eggs and paint as he left, holding up signs saying Judas. </p> <p>\"When you look at the faces and expressions of hatred on the people and listen to the expletives people are shouting, you have to be worried about what that mentality can lead to,\" he says. \"Those are people who have an absolute judgment about me and anyone who votes against hunting yet they've never met me, never had a dialogue.\" </p> <p>Mr Michael, a former journalist with the South Wales Echo and a youth worker in Cardiff's docklands, became an MP in 1987 but has never been a confrontational politician. From his days as a shadow home office minister through his time at the Wales Office, he has adopted a low-key approach to political life which makes his predicament more remarkable. </p> <p>Is he surprised at the level of vitriol? \"Deeply disappointed because I put an enormous amount of effort in trying to get people to listen to each other ... Some of the people who take their children along to these events don't understand the particularly awful example they are setting. There is such a focused belief that they are right ... that I believe they find it almost impossible to look outside their own mindset,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I have to say it's been equally difficult to persuade people who oppose hunting that a little room needs to be given to hunting people to accept change. We are starting to see seriously intimidating protests, an attempt to bully. I've even heard people say this is what we fought the second world war for. Well, actually it was rather more to defend a parliamentary democracy in which individual MPs ... cast their votes in the way which they think is right. </p> <p>\"There's no sort of attempt at persuasion or argument. It seems basically to be threats and intimidation or almost a feeling that spoiling our lives is reasonable retribution for the legislation which anyway is in the hands of parliament. The abuse convinces me that this issue has to be resolved.\" </p> <p>What effect has it had on his family? \"They're not happy with it, they're clearly upset by it, but they're very supportive,\" he says. </p> <p>He says Peter Hain, as leader of the House of Commons, and Lord Whitty, who handles the legislation in the Lords, had been subject to personal protests. </p> <p>He believes the row will blow over. \"Presumably the same decisions were taken at the time to ban bear baiting or cock fighting or dog fighting but I think, in retrospect, few people would seek to justify any of those activities.\" </p> <p>Does he sympathise with the view expressed in the Observer that foxhunting is a side issue, that far greater cruelty to animals is inflicted by factory farming? \"It's a different issue,\" he says. Foxhunting has become such a big battle it has to be settled. It is a choice by individual MPs, not something imposed by the government. </p> <p>He says that after long negotiations with the Countryside Alliance there had been a falling out, not least because of the tone taken by the alliance's website - which they justified by saying they feared that if they were too restrained the more belligerent groups would take over. </p> <p><b>Extreme</b><br> </p> <p>\"The language of the most moderate seems to be dictated by an attempt to appease the most extreme,\" he says. </p> <p>John Jackson, the alliance's chairman, has told Mr Michael that protests against him were \"entirely of your own creation. I have lost count of the times I have told you that, if you did not keep your promise to address the question of hunting on principle and evidence, the country would erupt in fury.\" </p> <p>Mr Jackson went on to say that Mr Michael's remarks about the legislation had been \"tyrannical and cruel\". Mr Michael says his postbag splits down the middle with 7,500 to 8,000 letters saying \"ban everything\" and the same number saying \"leave everything alone\". </p> <p>Will this be Tony Blair's poll tax? \"That's a very unfair comparison,\" he says. </p> <p>He says many people in the countryside oppose hunting but are reluctant to say so. \"There is a much quieter but significant number of country people, including farmers, who will be delighted to see an end to hunting, but because that view is not voiced very strongly in the circles that hunting people frequent - perhaps quite wisely on the part of those who hold those opinions - they are reinforced in the view that such opinions don't exist. So they have this mythology that somehow they speak for the countryside. </p> <p>\"I've frequently had people in the margins of meetings in the last couple years coming up to me and saying 'I'm a farmer, I think what you're doing is absolutely right. These [fox-hunters] are very single-minded people and I would not particularly say this in public, but they do damage to my land they don't really do anything to control the vermin, they're a very narrow and selfish group of people.' And I've certainly had messages from a lot of people concerned about the countryside thanking me.\" </p> <p><b>Election</b><br> </p> <p>The tempo of the campaign against him seems unlikely to slacken in the run-up to the general election, although the issue may be less important to the electorate than the pro-hunt lobby suggest. </p> <p>On October 4, the Daily Telegraph reported the results of a poll in which they asked people what would make them vote Conservative. A promise to continue to allow foxhunting came 13th on the list, below reducing the number of speed cameras and a promise to build more prisons. Only 6% said a reintroduction of hunting would make them more likely to vote Tory, compared with 49% who would be motivated by a clampdown on immigration. </p> <p>Another target of the campaign is Sir Gerald Kaufman, who wrote in this newspaper about his experience at the Labour party conference in Brighton where he said he had been attacked by people calling him a \"Jewish bigot\", including some who broke open his briefcase, tore his conference pass off him and jostled him until he was rescued by police. He described them as \"racist, larcenous scum\". </p> <p>The alliance's response, in the form of a letter from the chief executive, Simon Hart, was that Sir Gerald had brought the trouble on himself and had deliberately provoked the response. </p> <p>\"The Alliance,\" wrote Mr Hart, \"is determined that our protests will remain lawful and peaceful but, however much I would regret it, I cannot guarantee that angry people will not react to the sort of provocation Sir Gerald put them under.\" </p> <p>The alliance has condemned specific protests, such as breaking in to the House of Commons and the dumping of animal carcasses in Brighton during the Labour conference, but has promised the cam-paign will continue at full tilt. </p> <p>Mr Michael is learning, like the fox, that the best bet is to listen for the sound of the hunting horn, keep ahead of the pack and, when necessary, go to ground. Among the hobbies he lists in Who's Who is long-distance running. </p>",
  "Political anoraks who mourn the demise of Labour's control freakery will be pleased to hear that the spirit is alive and well in the Tory party. <p>Michael Howard is sending his MPs daily pager messages instructing them on the current \"line\". One moaned: \"We are finally discovering New Labour circa 1995.\" </p> <p>Pagers may seem passe in an era of mobile texting. The Howard camp believes them an excellent way to deliver a daily message from which MPs will deviate at their peril. </p> <p>Yesterday was bullet points on Tory plans to reform the health service. One loyal frontbencher said he thought paging an excellent idea: \"I think I received something on the NHS today. Of course, I was far too busy to read it.\" </p> <p>Having spent most of a decade bickering rather than changing policies, MPs got a taste of the disciplined approach at Wednesday night's backbench 1922 committee. Mr Howard, who is making a habit of laying down the law to troublemakers at these meetings, briefed from a four page \"bible\". </p> <p>\"It was like listening to a bad history lesson,\" moaned one MP. Mr Howard's five election pledges, which had been summed up in 10 words, were expanded to 40 words each. \"It all smacks of Maurice Saatchi,\" one MP said of the advertising guru who co-chairs the party. </p> <p>While there will be jibes about emulating New Labour control freakery of the 1990s (when Millbank issued stern electronic instructions not to stray \"off message\"), Mr Howard is more relaxed, because no serious Tory figure is questioning the leadership for the first time since the ERM disaster of 1992. Rather, what keeps him awake at night is an apparent failure to sell fresh policies; he hopes that arming MPs with facts will turn the tide as they canvass doorsteps. </p> <p>But the party knows it is vulnerable in one area - its inability to embrace the era of texting. \"Pagers are a good thing,\" one MP said defensively. \"They are silent and just buzz away. They are so much preferable to mobiles.\"</p>",
  "<p>A new cream or gel could block the transmission of HIV in heterosexual intercourse, according to new research today. The treatment is expensive, and so far has been tested only on monkeys.

  "<p>A leading man usually appeals to cinema audiences for one of two reasons: women want to sleep with him or men want to be like him. Occasionally an actor like Jack Nicholson will have cheerleaders in both teams, but the divide usually applies. </p> <p>Michael Caine, although radiating long-lashed, big-eyed sexuality in Alfie, is a classic instance of a man intended for men. The movie is framed as a morality tale - the audience is supposed to feel at the end that Alfie would have been happier with one woman and a couple of kids - but it seems likely that far more 60s women than men would have welcomed this message. Caine's performance represents a 60s male fantasy of character and behaviour: a fanny-magnet, as they used to say, with a big car and an even larger reservoir of charm and wisecracks. </p> <p>Alfie was hardly the first British study of male behaviour: the previous few years had seen Look Back in Anger (1959), Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960), A Kind of Loving (1962) and Billy Liar (1963). Even so, Caine's Alfie - a rare southern challenge to a largely northern character type - still astonishes for its nastiness and amorality. It's not clear if the writer Bill Naughton took Alfie's most shocking verbal tic - referring to women as \"it\" - from male speech of the time or if he invented it. But it must have been taken up by at least some of the men who went to see the film. </p> <p>Around the time he played Alfie, Caine was launching Harry Palmer, Len Deighton's working-class secret agent, in The Ipcress File (1965), Funeral in Berlin (1966) and Billion Dollar Brain (1967), before playing gangsters comically and then seriously in The Italian Job (1969) and Get Carter (1971). Watching these films again, Caine looks like the closest British cinema has ever had to a Jack Nicholson as a dangerous, sexual, amoral presence. Like Nicholson, he dared to give an uncensored depiction of masculinity. </p> <p>Nicholson's prominence in the 70s as cinema's man's man was typical of a shift to American role models, after Caine's dominance of the 60s. Subsequently, Michael Douglas twice animated - In Fatal Attraction (1987) and Disclosure (1994) - a new male fear about women: no longer (as in Alfie) pathetic creatures who used sex to trick you into marriage but demonic temptresses employing seduction to destroy your career and marriage. </p> <p>In turn-of-the-millennium movies, the division between actors women wanted to go to bed with and those men dreamed of taking to the pub has been complicated by a third camp of male stars who men imagine bedding. A majority of recently fashionable actors possess an ambiguous smoothness which, whatever their sexual appetites, is a feature of their appeal: Tom Cruise, Ewan McGregor, Leonardo Di Caprio and, in fact, the new Alfie, Jude Law. </p> <p>Because British cinema has never again matched the power it had in the 60s, the subsequent fictional equivalents of Alfie have come in other media: television and books. Alfred Elkins is clearly the grandfather of the \"lad\", the type of British male popularised in Simon Nye's TV series Men Behaving Badly and the novels of Nick Hornby and Tony Parsons. In fact, Parsons' returning hero, Harry Silver (in Man and Boy, and Man and Wife) can be seen as an Alfie who, in line with the feminisation of our times, may be a charming, philandering rogue but is nevertheless willing to bring up a kid alone and desperate to marry his subsequent girlfriends. But Harry - like Gary and Tony in Men Behaving Badly - feels to some extent like man as women would like him to be: deranged but tameable. </p> <p>Jude Law's modern Alfie equally represents discreet censorship of the male psyche. The original Alfie - astonishingly and still shockingly - stood for men as they really were or secretly dreamed of being.</p>",
  "<p>Don't let that title fool you. Nothing could be less English and clubbable than this horrifying new revenge thriller from Korea's new dark maestro Park Chan-wook, who gave us the stomach-churning Sympathy for Mr Vengeance and right about now is making the British and American offerings in this genre look pretty quaint. Oldboy has touches of Kafka, and echoes of British paranoia thrillers like The Ipcress File and The Prisoner. But it opens up a whole new sicko frontier of exotic horror, and more or less reduced my intestines to guacamole both times I watched it, not so much with its violence - although heaven knows there's a super-sized helping of that - but with a queasily ingenious imprisonment-torture impossible to contemplate without a prickling of cold sweat. </p> <p>It's a movie that you feel you're not so much watching on screen as having beamed directly into your skull from some malign, alien planet of horror. I've seen thrillers where I identified with the bad guys, with the victims or with the cops. This is the first time I've fervently identified with a small, live octopus - of which, more in a moment. </p> <p>Park's claustro-nightmare begins on a rainy night in Seoul in the late 1980s: a drunk and obnoxious guy called Oh Dae-su is forcibly detained in a police station waiting room for being drunk and disorderly. It is only when a long-suffering buddy turns up to vouch for him and pay off his bail that Dae-su is allowed out, but while his friend is calling his home from a pay-phone to explain what's happened, Dae-su is abducted and wakes up, locked in what appears to be a tatty hotel room. </p> <p>The terrible truth dawns on him, and us, only slowly as Dae-su alternately screams with rage at his captors and pathetically pleads for mercy. Someone hates him so much that killing or maiming isn't good enough. They have engaged an underground criminal contractor offering the satanically horrible niche service of imprisonment: Dae-su is going to be locked up - for 15 years. He is fed, clothed and drugged so that he cannot try to kill himself, and apart from the TV he has only one means of passing the time: trying to guess who he has offended. And at the end of all this time - which we see pass on a montage of TV images: the Berlin wall, the Hong Kong handover, Princess Diana's death, South Korea's World Cup run - he is deliberately released and encouraged to seek out his tormentor for an Old Testament showdown of retribution. </p> <p>Dae-su is played by Choi Min-sik, a heftily built presence last seen here playing an artist in Im Kwon-taek's period drama Drunk on Women and Poetry: the title of this could be Drunk on Hatred and Revenge. He has a massively ravaged and ruined face which in itself is fiercely expressive of unbearable, unassuageable emotion. His scarecrow features betoken an ecstatic embrace of madness: a belief that only in psychotic levels of hatred will he be able to summon up the necessary conviction for his survival and revenge. </p> <p>Once on the outside, Dae-su finds himself in a Japanese sushi bar, befriended by a beautiful young woman, and this meeting ushers in the movie's most extraordinary scene, which must have given the BBFC censors some sleepless nights. In a flourish of self-hatred and self-laceration that Titus Andronicus might have admired, Dae-su orders a live octopus, and gobbles it all down as the unfortunate beast writhes and slithers around his chin - just to show the world what he is capable of. Later, his coldly silent confrontation with the underling jailer is blood-freezingly bizarre. Dae-su holds up a hammer and a white dotted line appears on the screen joining his weapon and his victim's face: flat-pack assembly- instructions for a theatre of violence. He then takes on dozens of aggressors, and Park's camera tracks along the narrow corridor watching the pitched battle in profile, right-to-left, like a video-game graphic or a Bayeux Tapestry of urban warfare: another extraordinary coup du cin\u00e9ma . </p> <p>His opponent turns out to be a smooth-mannered sociopath called Lee played by Yu Ji-tae, who in his own way has a magnificent face: so perfectly handsome, but with a touch of minatory knowingness. He is pure Bond villain, with his extravagant penthouse lair and a disability that is straight out of Ian Fleming. Lee has had a heart-bypass operation and carries a tiny remote control device which he says will turn off his pacemaker: he could commit suicide and Dae-su would never know why his life has been destroyed. When the answer to this riddle comes, it is somehow sickeningly convincing that it lies not in the grown-up world of crime or business, but the teenage world of school. </p> <p>Oldboy certainly shows that it's Asia where the farthest reaches of extreme cinema are to be found, and the worst nightmare is that 15 years in prison, which leaves the numbed viewer wondering if that is an unspeakably long time - or perhaps an unspeakably short time in the nihilist wasteland Park conjures up. \"What happens after you've revenged yourself?\" wonders Dae-su. \"I bet the hidden pain will come back.\" This is cinema that holds an edge of cold steel against your throat.</p>",
  "<p>The grossly over-psychologised police film has made it east. Watching Infernal Affairs 2 recently, in the suitably gritty surrounds of the Prince Charles cinema, off Leicester Square, I realised to my horror that here were all the elements of the cop-flick-as-counselling-training-manual, transported to Hong Kong.</p> <p>There was the agonised hero, torn between the violent demands of his id and the superego straitjacket of police procedure. We had his discovery of his \"feminine\" side - signalled by the donning of a tan blouson jacket - and the homoerotic frisson between superior and inferior officers. There was even a bit of Oedipal action, in the form of the contest between the chubby crime boss Sam and his (apparent) protege over Sam's wife. Then we had the obligatory examination of the police career path: the rookie's progress, the uniforms and insignia, the disciplinary tribunal - the minutiae of police bureaucracy in all their glory.</p> <p>Infernal Affairs 2 lends international force to the pressing cinematic question: since when did police psychological make-up and employment structures repay such loving attention? This obsession reached its boiling point, if I may, with Heat, a fabulously overpraised Michael Mann film from the mid-1990s that was so laden with bathos it almost dripped from the screen. The Pacino and De Niro characters, cop and crim respectively, spend so much time on the metaphorical couch it is a wonder they get to shoot at anything. (They do get to in the end - each other, of course.)</p> <p>Heat may represent the police weepie at its wettest, but we heard its birth cries from Bad Lieutenant in 1992. The theme of the film was one with which we could all identify: the incipient mental collapse of a corrupt, Catholic, middle-aged, New York police officer. And the impassioned - or perhaps just loud - performance of Harvey Keitel, with its moans, genuflections and visions, established the sturm und drang that would become another hallmark of the rent-cop franchise.</p> <p>Repressed desire, we may infer, lies behind the Lieutenant's angst, and sex is never far beneath the surface of the law-enforcement mood piece. It burst through the screen again last year, in Jane Campion's In the Cut. Mark Ruffalo's homicide detective, in a potentially deadly clinch with Meg Ryan's writer, polished another important facet of the police psychological study: the cop as Lothario.</p> <p>These films drape reality with all the facility of a Dior frock flung over a bullock. They exemplify the glaring incongruities of the police psychodrama. Cops, even detectives, are not characteristically torn, Byronic creatures but, rather, conformist types possessed of what the great social theorist Theodor Adorno identified as an \"authoritarian personality\". The authoritarian is no maverick, nor an iconoclast, nor even a loner; he actively distrusts marginal types, delights in hierarchy and relishes rules.</p> <p>My purpose is less to observe that the police turn fascist at the drop of a historical hat or that - as we saw recently on the smaller screen - they attract individual fascists in embarrassingly high numbers. It is to point out that it seems unfair to freight our men and women in uniform with these psychological expectations when they must already be quite busy with paperwork.</p> <p>The second swerving departure from the reality principle concerns why we, the audience, are expected to be so fascinated with the details of police officers' lives - the job choices, the sexual element, the mid-life crises, the inadequate pay, and so on - when most of us only encounter the police when getting a speeding fine or, say, being manhandled back over the barrier while trying to escape being almost crushed to death by the surging crowd at the last Notting Hill carnival. Why not \"the life and loves of a parking inspector\"? You see them more often, and half of them probably have riskier lives - in Hackney, anyway.</p> <p>Yet the celluloid trend appears to be towards ever more scrutiny of the police life course. I would not be surprised if crime were soon dispensed with altogether in the most cutting-edge examples of the genre in favour of, perhaps, tender Bergmanesque depictions of intra-force romance, edgy promotion dramas or extended atmospheric treatments of police people in retirement.</p> <p>Except that criminals themselves are not being spared characterological frisking. A further tendency is the sensitive examination of what we might call the \"new psychopath\". The Sopranos TV series and the weak De Niro comedies Analyse This and Analyse That have already picked up on the implicit criminal psychotherapy (not what you might think) in many a crime film, but they do not appear to have put a stop to it.</p> <p>A rounded, thoughtful analysis of the struggles undergone by a heartlessly mass-murdering, insatiably avaricious, recidivist burglar was already there in Heat, but in Infernal Affairs 2, the complex crime supremo receives perhaps his most full-blooded exposure yet. With his thin, elegant frame, matching specs and tasteful suits, Francis Ng, playing the chief of the ruling Hong Kong criminal dynasty, looks like the kind of man any left-leaning government would love to have in charge of its arts-funding board rather than the child kidnapper and heroin importer he is apparently supposed to be.</p> <p>Complicated cops, and their gangster counterparts, were not always with us. The police personas of Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson, with their full-cream machismo, ruled the 1980s. There are also alternative officers on patrol, such as Marge Gunderson in the Coen brothers' Fargo. Yet my choice of character for rescuing the cop film would be the one who kicked the genre into existence beneath the setting sun of the western. Inspector Callahan may be no more realistic than Pacino's or Keitel's lieutenants, Ruffalo's detective or Anthony Wong's superintendent, but he is certainly less irritating.</p> <p>Go ahead, Hollywood, bring back Dirty Harry. Make my day.</p>",
  "<p>Jude Law is a very handsome man, in a David Beckham-before-the-fall kind of way, clean-cut and somehow innocent, good to look at while he's sleeping. He stars in the remake of the 1966 film Alfie. It is very fit and meet that he does. Lots of young men these days look like that. Gentle. </p> <p>In the new Alfie, Manhattan glitters and sparkles, snow falls in celebration upon the well-fed and housed and there is always a parking space. The girls are all beautiful and smiling, and a burka-clad woman will turn and give a nice-looking young man a wink. A chauffeur can afford to live in the Upper East Side and the woman next door, elderly and Polish, will turn to Alfie and say as he leaves in the morning with a girl, \"Good to see you're going out with an African- American woman, Alfie.\" Perhaps soon all our cities will be like this. Perhaps like our young men, our cities will be transfigured. If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. </p> <p>We have lost our appetite for gritty reality. We prefer the evidence of the screen to the evidence of our eyes. Only in the theatre does dire reality linger on, in murky plays by angry young persons. Those audiences dwindle - but we'll still turn out for Mary Poppins. </p> <p>If you are a woman under 40 you will take what you're shown on the screen for granted. Women have the upper hand, as will seem to you right and proper. Loving Alfie may cause his emotional victims a moment's petulance because Alfie has \"commitment issues\", but his women have good teeth, high self-esteem, jobs to go to, abortion clinics to run to, and they occupy the moral high ground. </p> <p>I hope the film does well. It can do nobody any possible harm. And Alfie learns better: a life-lesson. \"Find someone to love and live every day as though it's your last.\" Can't be bad: another nice, feelgood message. </p> <p>But I came out from the preview looking for a bus to jump under. It is a terrible thing to see your dreams come true. Sexual equality, as evidenced by this film, has been very bad for art. Morality, the struggle between good and bad, in the world and in our natures, has been subsumed into emotional and political correctness. The box office is hungry, and must be fed. It gets what it is thought to want, not what it needs. </p> <p>Bad for art but good for people. The original 1966 film was painful, excoriating, true. Alfie was a predator, women were his helpless victims: they couldn't earn enough to keep themselves; they lived by the goodwill of men. They scrubbed floors and cooked pies for male approval, without which they perished, and their reproaches were plentiful, justified, and on the whole mute. One look from poor Vivien Merchant, as the mother-of-three made pregnant by Alfie, towards Denholm Elliott's moralist abortionist, told us more about human nature than the whole remake. Just briefly, Merchant howls like an animal, then prudence shuts her up. </p> <p>\"What's it all about, Alfie?\" was the closing line of the original, and it gave you pause to think: what indeed? The line is left out of the remake - it's become a meaningless question. What it's about, which once was a paradox, is now all too clear: self-interest. Choice has replaced necessity. We are all nice people, and if love makes us unhappy then call it neurotic dependency. In the remake, Lonette (Alfie's best friend's girlfriend) has sex with Alfie not because she's hopelessly in love with him but because she gets drunk. She is not wretched; she is foolish. </p> <p>It was the original Alfie that started me, and many of my generation, on the road to feminism. We watched it and left the cinema trembling. We saw that the indignity, emotional pain and helplessness that went with being a woman in the 1960s was monstrous and couldn't, mustn't last. It fell to writer Bill Naughton to speak for us: very few women wrote for the screen in the 60s - the job was \"technical\" and therefore not for females, who couldn't understand cameras. But Naughton could not appreciate, as only a woman could, that there was a new, more pernicious twist to the timeless Don Juan archetype. Sure, there had always been men who kissed and left. But this was something worse. </p> <p>The pill had come along. Women, not men, were now \"responsible for contraception\", so men, relieved of the duty of care, and with no sanctions to restrain them, took advantage of this new arrangement and behaved disgracefully. Male respect for women diminished. Unmarried women who had sex were slags, and those who did not were frigid. How could you win? Those with any aspiration beyond admiring and serving a man were dismissed (and openly described) as ugly, unable to get a man, or in need of a good lay. Young men, outnumbered by young women, as they now are not, did the sexual picking and choosing. \"Sisterhood\" as a concept had not been invented: all women were assumed to be in constant competition for the attention of a man, and indeed were. The man was their meal ticket. \"Sexism\" as a word did not exist. As with \"racism\", also a newcomer to the language, as soon as it was there you could deal with it, fight it, change the world. Forty years on, things have settled down. Women have corrected the balance by attacking male self-esteem, making men, in their turn, over-anxious to be liked and in need of approval. </p> <p>The change in society brought about by female contraceptives and women's new capacity to earn - not to mention the arrival of the domestic technology that means a house can be cleaned in half an hour and food put on the table in two minutes - has been sudden and profound. Give us another 40 years and we may get it all right. </p> <p>Eroticism in the new world may have suffered somewhat on the way. The new Alfie has problems with \"sexual dysfunction\". The old Alfie wouldn't have even known the words, let alone the problem. The doctor our modern hero sees is a gay man - and Alfie's organ springs to life at his touch. Quite what point is being made here is hard to understand. Perhaps that anyone will do. </p> <p>The original, callous Alfie lives with a girl briefly, and leaves when their child becomes too much of a nuisance. New Alfie takes up temporarily with a single mother, proving he's a nice guy at heart by being fond of another man's child: far too strong for today's tender audience were he seen to abandon his own. The strength of the original Alfie's monologues to the camera is that he refers to women not as \"she\" but as \"it\". It shocked even then. Now it is unthinkable, obscene. </p> <p>In the meantime, in the remake, the sad, quiet girl who obsessively scrubbed and suffered in the 60s has been replaced with a manically cheerful girl who smokes (yuk), paints the walls a disagreeable shade of green without asking and gets dumped as a result. New Alfie has what is presumably an Aids scare, though the word is never mentioned. At least that fear never crossed the mind of the 60s girl. Sex was still holy, magic, sacramental, and linked in the mind with procreation, the creating of new life; that it might also be profoundly unsafe occurred to no one. In the original, Alfie develops TB, is obliged to think about mortality, and seduces his best friend's wife for consolation. The equivalent sin for the contemporary Alfie would be to have sex before the all-clear is given - but there's no way that can happen in a feelgood film of the new century. Not our Jude. </p> <p>Nor, of course, can Lonette have an abortion, nor can Alfie get to see the result and be shocked and changed. That would be too real, too graphic, and what is more, one fears, might upset the pro-life section of the audience. Susan Sarandon as the older woman can't be fair, fat and 40 but still sexy, as was blowsy Shelley Winters in the original. Sarandon may be 50 but she must also be presented as smart, feisty, elegant, good-looking and desirable to all. Mind you, the two-timing Sarandon delivers the put-down punchline \"because he's younger than you\", superbly: the desire to speak the truth and the need to be kind battle it out in her face. That truth at least remains. </p> <p>Sienna Miller, who plays Nikki \"the Christmas miracle\", (and is Law's real-life girlfriend) claims she couldn't watch the original all the way through because \"she was shocked by the cruelty of Alfie's character\". She is right. He was cruel. But the emotional cruelty was the point of the film. Alfie became aware of it and, with Alfie, a whole generation of men. They took on the burden of change, and succeeded. If New Alfie is seen as \"bad\", it's because of his failure to \"commit\". This is a social rather than an emotional crime. Surely men have some residual right not to love women if they don't want to? \"Fortunately,\" Miller goes on to say, \"in our version the people are developed\" - I fear she is not joking - \"and Alfie's emotions are more intense.\" True, Alfie hits a windscreen to demonstrate sorrow and frustration, but he doesn't look at you with the wary, predatory, cunning, winking charm of his dangerous forbear. He's much too nice: he's what all those suffering, scrubbing girls eventually made of Old Alfie. I hope they enjoy him. It was a hard task bringing him about.</p>"
