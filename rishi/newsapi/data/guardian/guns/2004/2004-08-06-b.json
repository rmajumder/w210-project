  "Moscow has issued a warning to Georgia that it will protect holidaying Russians from any aggression in Georgia's breakaway Black Sea resort region of Abkhazia, after weeks of escalating tension between the Kremlin and the US-backed president of the former Soviet republic, Mikhail Saakashvili. <p>The Georgian leadership has stated that Abkhazia is not a place for holidays, but a war zone. </p> <p>\"Doesn't this mean that Tbilisi wants to play with fire?\" a Russian foreign ministry press release that pledged to protect Russian citizens said, the Interfax news agency reported. </p> <p>Abkhazia, which has enjoyed de facto independence from Georgia since a war in the early 1990s, is trying to strengthen ties with Russia, amid pledges from Mr Saakashvili that he will bring both Abkhazia and South Ossetia, another breakaway region of Georgia, back under central control. </p> <p>Skirmishes in South Ossetia have been going on since late July. </p> <p>Earlier this week, a Russian delegation to the region complained of being fired on by Georgian troops. Georgia denied the charge and said that the gunfire came from the Ossetian side. </p> <p>Earlier this week, Mr Saakashvili infuriated Moscow by warning Russian tourists to stay away from Abkhazia, which is popular for its cheap Black Sea resorts, or risk their passenger boats being sunk for illegally crossing into Georgian waters. </p> <p>The Russian Duma, or lower house of parliament, issued a statement warning that the conflict was \"rapidly moving towards a large-scale military standoff in the Caucasus\", and saying that Georgia risked dragging Russia into it. </p> <p>Mr Saakashvili repeated his warning on Thursday in Washington after a meeting with the US secretary of state, Colin Powell. </p> <p>\"Abkhazia is no place for rest. It is a war zone, from where 300,000 Georgians have been expelled,\" he said, the Itar-Tass agency reported. However, Mr Saakashvili also said that Georgia would not allow \"hotheads in Russia\" to drag it into armed conflict. </p> <p>The Amerian state department has said it is maintaining contacts with both Russia and Georgia, and has called on them to settle the situation peacefully. Georgia is important as the site of a new oil pipeline to link the Caspian Sea deposits with Europe.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Which SPF do I need?</strong><br> \"Whatever your skin colour, use sun lotion with at least SPF15 and four stars. Most people apply protection too thinly, so at least 30 minutes before you go out, put on a layer that you can actually see, and reapply after sweating, swimming or washing.\" <br><strong>Catherine Harwood</strong>, <br>consultant dermatologist, Cancer Research UK </p> <p><strong>What do SPF and the stars on suncare bottles mean?</strong> <br>\"SPF measures UVB protection, and stars UVA protection. The star system isn't perfect; it is based on a ratio of UVB to UVA protection, so a five-star SPF4 gives hardly any UVA protection. And the problem with the SPF system is that it's based on time taken to burn, but sunlight that's not strong enough to burn will still damage DNA, which is what causes ageing and cancer.\" <br> <strong>Dr Mark Birch-Machin</strong>, <br> reader in dermatology, University of Newcastle </p> <p><strong>How do you know you're getting the SPF that's listed on the bottle?</strong> <br>\"You can't be sure. A recent Which? report showed that there is a huge variation in what's in suncare bottles. So, to be sure that you're properly protected, use a higher factor - ie, if you'd have gone for an SPF15, say, use SPF20 or even SPF25.\" <br> <strong>Dr Mark Birch-Machin</strong> </p> <p><strong>Which are better, physical or chemical sunscreens?</strong> <br>\"Chemical sunscreens absorb the energy in sunlight, soaking up the damage before it gets through the skin. Physical or mineral sunscreens are blockers, which means they bounce back sunlight. Personally, I use a combination.\" <br> <strong>Dr Mark Birch-Machin</strong> </p> <p><strong>Can I get away with using cheap sun lotions?</strong> <br>\"There may be no difference in protection between cheap and expensive sun lotions, so you could be paying merely for the name.\" <br> <strong>Dr Mark Birch-Machin</strong> </p> <p><strong>Can kids go in the sun at all?</strong> <br>\"Of course. Children can have fun in the sun if they're covered up. They should wear SPF-protective swimsuits, baggy cotton clothes, wraparound sunglasses and hats with brims. Use high-factor sprays on exposed bits, and change wet clothes, which lose their SPF protection. Babies under one should be kept in total shade.\" (Visit <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/sunsmart\">cancerresearchuk.org/sunsmart</a> for more information.) <br> <strong>Catherine Harwood</strong> </p> <p><strong>How bad for me are sunbeds?</strong> <br>\"As bad as sunbathing. Both emit UV rays, which increase the risk of skin cancer.

It's listed as a cosmetic ingredient under EU legislation, so is likely to be safe with normal dose and usage. It is an older chemical, and if it were truly toxic, this would have been picked up.\" <br> <strong>Adam Woolley</strong>, <br> toxicologist and fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists</p>",
  "<p>Quite a few people fantasise about mosaic tiling; that idea they had to inlay a lemon tree in the hall floor or recreate a design seen in Mexico. But do they ever get round to it? Of course not. The intention is there, but coordinating the purchase of tiles, glue and grout, while remembering to get the yogurt from Tesco, is too much. </p> <p>Visit a mosaic specialist (Mosaic Workshop in London, Fired Earth stores nationwide, or Scotland's Wild Tiles) and all this will change. At Mosaic Workshop, jars full of hot pink, tangerine and aqua glass make the place look like an old-fashioned sweet shop, and the works-in-progress lying around (some panels for Westminster Cathedral when I visited) are equally enticing. You'll leave with pocketfuls of glass, gold leaf and Mexican ceramics. </p> <p>Mosaic tiling is, however, messy and time-consuming, so it's a good idea to block off a weekend for a project the size of this table. A weekend is quite a commitment in this day and age, but unlike a night on the tiles, two days with tiles is rewarding, shame-free and fun - especially if you do it with friends. </p> <p><strong>You will need</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Tiles</strong><br>You can smash plates or buy tesserae (lingo for the little tiles) online, but mosaic virgins should head for Mosaic Workshop, 020-7263 2997 (<a href=\"http://www.mosaicworkshop.com\">mosaicworkshop.com</a>) or a branch of Fired Earth, 01295 812088 (<a href=\"http://www.firedearth.co.uk\">firedearth.co.uk</a>) to get a feel for different materials. </p> <p><strong>Rubber gloves</strong><br>Heavy-duty tile nippers (Homebase, \u00a311.99) Don't bother with \"nibblers\": the difference is like using plastic scissors instead of metal. </p> <p><strong>Goggles</strong><br>Tile grout (Granfix, from Mosaic Workshop, \u00a33 per 1.5kg bag) </p> <p><strong>Cement-based tile adhesive</strong><br>(Arduflex 5000, from Mosaic Workshop, \u00a33 per 1kg bag) </p> <p><strong>Notched adhesive spreader</strong><br>(\u00a31.89, Homebase) </p> <p><strong>Brown paper</strong> </p> <p><strong>Paintbrushes</strong> </p> <p><strong>Water-soluble PVA</strong><br>This will stick the tiles to your design, then peel off. </p> <p><strong>Dust mask</strong> </p> <p><strong>Method</strong><br> </p> <p>There are two approaches to mosaic making: direct (sticking the tile directly on to a surface) and indirect (sticking the tiles face down on paper first, then flipping on to an adhesive-coated surface). I'm showing the latter; it's better for intricate patterns and you'll end up with a truly flat surface - ideal for a drinks table. </p> <p><strong>1</strong> Cut a piece of brown paper to fit your surface and draw a pattern on the less shiny side. </p> <p><strong>2</strong> Plan the colours and pick the tiles; you can use glass, ceramic or mirror. Look at websites for ideas (<a href=\"http://www.mosaicworkshop.com\">mosaicworkshop.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wildtiles.co.uk\">wildtiles.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thejoyofshards.co.uk\">thejoyofshards.co.uk</a>). And go into a shop to handle tiles first. </p> <p><strong>3</strong> Mix PVA in a jar with an equal quantity of water - be careful not to use more glue than water, or the brown paper will never peel off your tiles. </p> <p><strong>4</strong> Using a paintbrush, dab a little of this mix on the posh side of the tiles and stick one row, face down, around the outer edge of your design. Remember, you're going to flip the whole thing over, so at this stage the backs should be uppermost. A 1-2mm gap between each tile looks good. Avoid going any closer as this makes grouting more tricky. </p> <p><strong>5</strong> Wearing goggles, cut tiles to fill patterned areas, then do the background last. To cut tiles, place the edge of the tile in the jaw of the nippers and gently squeeze the handles. You can angle nippers to cut diagonal lines or other shapes. </p> <p><strong>6</strong> Nail a thin copper lip around the perimeter of your table surface - buy it from a mosaic specialist and ask for a finishing clip to hide the join of the two ends. </p> <p><strong>7</strong> Wearing rubber gloves, mix the cement-based adhesive according to its instructions. Spread it on your surface with a notched spreader, ensuring uniform thickness. NB: Work through the next three steps quickly because the adhesive remains workable for only 40 minutes. </p> <p><strong>8</strong> Mix the grout to a smooth, thick consistency and rub between the tiles (yes, they're still on the brown paper) using hands or a grout spreader. Doing the grouting at this stage prevents your table adhesive coming through between the tiles when you press them in. </p> <p><strong>9</strong> Use a damp sponge to wipe away excess grout, cleaning the sponge between wipes so you're not just moving grout around. </p> <p><strong>10</strong> Get a friend to help gently lift your grouted mosaic and place it paper side up on to the adhesive, pressing firmly into place. </p> <p><strong>11</strong> Dampen the paper with a wet sponge and wait 15-20 minutes for the glue to dissolve before peeling it off. If it doesn't peel easily, dampen again and wait a bit longer. </p> <p><strong>12</strong> Wipe the surface clean with a damp sponge. </p> <p><strong>13</strong> When dry, re-grout to fill any gaps. </p> <p>Now it's time to book in for a manicure.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Economics of Innocent Fraud: Truth for Our Time</strong><br>by JK Galbraith<br>78pp, Allen Lane, \u00a310</p> <p>It is some time since we have heard from JK Galbraith, which is not entirely surprising. At 95 he may be excused some gaps in what has, for 75 years, been a regular flow of stimulating political and economic writing.</p> <p>The general assumption, I think, was that he had finally retired from the fray. The Economics of Innocent Fraud shows that is far from the case. He has re-emerged with a pungent, if short, essay on economics, corporate politics and the terminology of public discourse.</p> <p>Galbraith has long argued that major corporations, whether in the US or elsewhere, are run by their management, largely for their own benefit, and without effective public control or oversight. The collapse of Enron, and the related and unrelated stories of corporate fraud, unbridled greed and negligent auditing, have given much support to the Galbraithian thesis. As a result, although the words themselves do not appear, there is a strong \"I told you so\" theme running through the book. We may take it that Galbraith was not among those who sympathised with the plight of \"Kenny boy\" Lay, photographed in handcuffs on the way to the Houston courtroom. And I doubt whether Galbraith will be contributing to the Denis Kozlowski legal support fund. Indeed, he is an unashamed fan of Elliott Spitzer, New York attorney-general and the scourge of Wall Street.</p> <p>But his ambitions in this rather curious essay are more lofty: this is not just an exercise in well-deserved gloating. It is a broader critique of the way we talk and write about economic and business life. At least I think it is, since it has to be said that not all the points he makes are wholly clear. The editors have allowed a somewhat staccato style of writing. Sentences without verbs. And sometimes sentences without apparent meaning: \"Let no one try to sell without consumer management, control\" is not easy to parse.</p> <p>But there is a powerful thesis, if at times it struggles to emerge. He argues that much conventional discourse about political, economic and corporate life is based on what he mischievously characterises as \"innocent fraud\". Much of this fraud is, in a sense, semantic. We describe phenomena in misleading ways. Perhaps the most misleading term, according to Galbraith, is the phrase \"the market system\". In his view, this is a meaningless construct, coined primarily to avoid use of the term \"capitalism\", widely seen as a weak brand in the political market.</p> <p>He complains, too, and with some justification, about the blurring of the line between the public and private sectors. If he were writing about the UK, I am sure he would express deep anxiety about the private finance initiative, and about the now fashionable notion of the social market. In the US context his prime target is the relationship between the Pentagon and the defence industry. He argues that both the US Treasury and the Department of Defence have been under \"corporate control\" for some years, and notes the increasingly confused roles of the US army and private security firms in combat zones, particularly Iraq.</p> <p>And the businesses concerned are, in Galbraith's view, simple manifestations of the interests of their top management. He rejects the notion that stockholders or investors own corporations. He pays no attention whatsoever to what some see as a significant consequence of the Enron debacle: the growing power and influence of institutional investor groupings, which have been flexing their muscles on both sides of the Atlantic. None of this, in his analysis, has altered the fundamentals of corporate power. The technocracy remains in the ascendant.</p> <p>That, he thinks, goes some way to explaining the explosion in senior executive pay. Furthermore, he attacks the notion that CEOs are worthy of the extravagant sums they are paid, by virtue of their entrepreneurial skills and willingness to take wealth-creating risks. He argues that in most large corporations the essential skill required to reach the top is the ability to work effectively within a complex and stifling bureaucracy.</p> <p>He sees management education itself as part of a conspiracy to delude the public into believing in the myth of corporate entrepreneurship: \"The vital role of bureaucracy, even though almost never so designated, and success therein is unmentioned. In common discourse, bureaucracy and bureaucratic achievement exist in government, not in the corporate world.\" Were CEOs to be correctly portrayed as super-bureaucrats, their \"compensation\" packages might be materially reduced.</p> <p>Many public servants in this country will find this argument strikes a chord. How different are the skills required to succeed in, say, Shell, from those needed in the Treasury? (Apart, of course, from the need in the former case to cultivate a blind eye.)</p> <p>Were this the principal thrust of The Economics of Innocent Fraud, one would have little difficulty in commending it to any student of public policy and corporate regulation on either side of the Atlantic. But Galbraith indulges himself further than this, and has the Federal Reserve in his sights, too.</p> <p>It is not so much that he wishes to criticise particular decisions made by the Fed in the last few years. Though he sneers, rather, at chairman Alan Greenspan, he does not take issue with the decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee under his chairmanship - contestable though those may have been in the past year, at least. Galbraith is above such banal issues. His off-centre view is that, since it was founded in 1913, the Fed \"has had a record against inflation and notably against recession of deep and unrelieved inconsequence\".</p> <p>He argues that the favourable reputation the Fed currently enjoys is entirely false, and that the impact of central bank actions is minimal: \"Only in innocence does it control general consumer and business spending.\" The FOMC may be filled with men and women of good intention, so he would not wish to deny them \"their largely innocent enjoyment of what in economic effect is a well-established fraud. Perhaps we should let their ineffective role be accepted and forgiven.\"</p> <p>If his point is that central banks should see their role as leaning into or away from the prevailing economic winds, there may be some in Washington, or Threadneedle Street, who would have some sympathy with the argument. But that, I think, is a long way from saying their actions are wholly ineffective. Small interest-rate changes are magnified many-fold in their impact on bond and sometimes equity markets. So to characterise the Monetary Policy Committee's role as entirely fraudulent economic policy-making is hardly a serious analytical point. But then, just as he is generously inclined to give the FOMC members the benefit of the doubt as to their personal motives, perhaps we should reciprocate.</p> <p>Galbraith has been an agent provocateur all his life. No point in stopping now. After all, as Yeats asked, why should not old men be mad?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sir Howard Davies is director of the London School of Economics</p>",
  "<p>Rumours that Barclays is discussing a \u00a345bn takeover by the huge American financial firm Citigroup led to a 10% jump in the British bank's share price at one point yesterday amid exceptionally heavy trading volume. </p> <p>Neither bank would comment on the speculation and shares in Barclays finally settled at 500p - an increase of 18.75p, or 3.9%, on the day. </p> <p>During the first four hours of trading more than 100m shares changed hands - about four times the normal volume in the stock. </p> <p>Talk of a possible takeover bid for Barclays dominated a stock market where traders are already fixated by the prospect of a multi-party battle for control of Abbey National. A recommended offer has been tabled by Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano but the Halifax and Bank of Scotland group, HBOS, has indicated it might make a bid for the bank. </p> <p>Fevered discussion about Barclays' future came a day after the bank reported record interim results, with profits being largely fired by its investment banking and fund management operations rather than its core retail banking business. </p> <p>The rumours about Barclays first emerged on Wednesday, when City dealing rooms began to buzz with talk of a bid pitched at about 700p a share from Citigroup. </p> <p>The refusal of Barclays and Citigroup to comment yesterday was in sharp contrast to Abbey's reaction a fortnight ago, when it was forced by a rise in its share price to confirm it was in takeover talks. </p> <p>Banking specialists noted that the speculation was having a revitalising effect on the entire sector. Donald Tosh, an analyst at Glasgow-based broker Speirs &amp; Jeffrey, said: \"The banking sector as a whole is good value. The rumours may or may not be true, but at least they are having the effect of crystallising value.\" </p> <p>Nick Lord, a banking analyst at Deutsche Bank, also believes the sector is underrated. \"We've got a 540p target for Barclays. All banks look pretty cheap - Lloyds TSB, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland. But Barclays is not cheap relative to its peers.\" </p> <p>Anxiety about the banks' ability to keep churning out record profits, particularly at a time when interest rates are rising, is being blamed for the low valuations. </p> <p>John Varley, the long-serving Barclays executive who becomes chief executive next month, also commented on the share price at the company's interim results. </p> <p>\"At our current share price levels we are buyers of our shares, not sellers,\" Mr Varley said. Dealers later pointed out that, true to Mr Varley's words, Barclays had been buying its shares in the market on Thursday; it would be in breach of City codes it if were buying while being locked in takeover talks. </p> <p>Others ruled out a bid for Barclays because they believe Mr Varley will want to make his mark and has not yet officially assumed his new role, although he did outline a plan to diversify Barclays' profits and increase the proportion earned overseas from 20%. </p> <p>Others said that Matt Barrett, his predecessor as chief executive who is moving up to the chairman's seat, was more keen to complete a big deal after being thwarted by the competition authorities in Canada when he tried to negotiate a big merger there. </p> <p>Separately, HSBC continued its expansion into China by taking a near-20% stake in the local Bank of Communications. China does not permit larger stakes to be taken in local banks but has agreed to open up its markets by 2007 as part of its membership of the World Trade Organisation. As a result many international banks are looking for a presence in the country. </p> <p>Bank of Communications is expected to float on the Hong Kong stock market next year.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of repossession victims still being chased for debts many years after losing their homes could now get mortgage lenders off their backs - thanks to a landmark legal decision. </p> <p>A Court of Appeal verdict in favour of a Norfolk couple and against the West Bromwich Building Society will stop lenders pursuing many former homeowners, forced to leave their properties up to 15 or more years ago when they fell into mortgage arrears. </p> <p>The judgment will cost lenders millions, forcing them to refund money paid in the past following debt demands. </p> <p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s many homebuyers borrowed to the hilt, fearful of being priced out of the then soaring property market. But as house prices peaked, borrowers were squeezed between fast rising interest rates and growing dole queues. Repossessions hit an all-time high. </p> <p>Most repossessed properties, whether the borrowers handed in keys or were hit by a court order, were worth less than the outstanding debt. This negative equity worsened from late 1989 onwards as the big house price slump knocked more than 50% off some property values. </p> <p>But many home losers picked themselves up, dusted themselves down, and eventually bought another home. </p> <p>They thought their home loan debt misery was in the past. But lenders claimed they had 12 years in which they could begin action to chase former homeowners. By that time, many who had had arrears were now back in positive equity thanks to house price gains. They could afford to pay, lenders reasoned. </p> <p>They were tracked down. and asked for huge sums - in one case over \u00a3350,000 - to cover past arrears, interest, repossession and sale costs, insurance and negative equity. </p> <p>Last week the Court of Appeal decided lenders had chosen the wrong starting date for the 12 year \"limitation\" period. It found for the Wilkinsons, a Norfolk couple, and against the West Bromwich. </p> <p>Lenders had always counted the 12 years from the day the property was sold - even if this was long after the repossession. But the new ruling says the 12-year clock starts ticking from the date the borrower first fell into arrears. \"The gap between the two can be many years,\" says solicitor Stephen Murrell of Staple Inn Partnership in London's Chancery Lane, who helped research the case. \"The way is now open for legal help for thousands of borrowers who are, or who are liable to be, pursued for arrears outstanding when their homes were repossessed. The judgment has a general application. Banks and building societies will either have to drop debt chasing or return money they have already taken.\" </p> <p>In October 1988, Mark and Lynne Wilkinson borrowed \u00a334,895 from West Bromwich Building Society to buy a house in Norfolk, paying \u00a3484 a month. In January 1989, the couple hit hard times and fell into arrears. </p> <p>In late July 1989, the West Bromwich repossessed. By now the Wilkinsons' debt had jumped to \u00a343,648. </p> <p>In November 1990, the West Bromwich sold the house for \u00a334,000. It then claimed the Wilkinsons owed more than \u00a357,000 - leaving \u00a323,921 after the sale proceeds. The society also claimed 8% annual interest. </p> <p>The Wilkinsons, who had no money, found a new home. They put their debt nightmare to the back of their minds. Their peace was shattered in November 2002 - 12 years less two days after their former home was sold - when the West Bromwich tracked them down and demanded the \u00a323,921, plus interest and costs. The couple approached the Diss and District Citizens Advice for help. </p> <p>Then they went to court, arguing the 12 years should start from the date of the ar rears, not from the house sale date. \"They lost in the county court. There were at least 15 other similar cases which were found in favour of the banks,\" says barrister Nigel Meares, a property and land law expert. </p> <p>\"But they were given the right to appeal so there must have been some doubts,\" says Meares, who acted for the Wilkinsons on a no-win, no-fee basis. </p> <p>\"We had to accept the period to recover a mortgage debt was 12 years - last year's Bristol &amp; West vs Bartlett case decided that. So it all revolved around when those 12 years kicked off - in legal parlance 'when the right to receive money' started,\" he says. </p> <p>Meares cited the 1833 limitation act, an 1882 appeal court case, a 1894 case, a 1980 law, and several other legal precedents. </p> <p>And all three appeal judges agreed with him. \"More than 12 years had expired for the date of arrears. The society could not recover the shortfall,\" the court said. </p> <p>Lenders have yet to decide how to react to the decision. The Council of Mortgage Lenders said: \"We are still considering the ruling. We will be discussing it further with the West Bromwich Building Society and with the rest of our members before deciding whether or not we think it has any wider implications for the industry.\" </p> <p>\"We do not believe it is right to make any comment,\" said West Bromwich.</p>",
  "<p>Forget fruit picking, working in a bar or even being a lifeguard. Britain's most sought after temp job is working as a film extra. According to Jobcentre Plus, which advertises a million short-term summer jobs, nothing attracts applicants more than appearing as an extra in the next Hollywood blockbuster. </p> <p>Earlier this year, Jobcentres advertised for the next Batman movie, filming at Hatfield in Hertfordshire, and were inundated with hopefuls. </p> <p>But can a job as an extra be taken seriously? What's the money like, and can it lead to anything more serious in the film industry? </p> <p>Firstly, forget the word \"extra\". They are known in the industry as \"supporting artists\" or \"SAs\" and their job is to perform the non-speaking roles that make scenes in films and TV programmes look authentic: drinkers in a bar, passers-by in a street or soldiers in a battle scene. </p> <p>Although it can be fun and varied, it is not as glamorous as some imagine: a whole day can be spent filming one short scene over and over again, requiring a great degree of patience. </p> <p>Hours are also spent sitting around while costumes and sets are prepared, or other scenes are shot, and a good alarm clock is vital, too, as the most common start time is 7am. </p> <p>Being an SA is not an automatic stepping stone to a fully-fledged acting career. Only occasionally are SAs given roles with dialogue. </p> <p>While there are plenty of minor actors working as background artists for the extra income, many worry that getting spotted doing it may damage their reputation in the industry. </p> <p>The best way to find background work is by joining a specialist casting agency. These provide SAs for TV productions, films and commercials. </p> <p>However, places are limited and agencies usually recruit just once a year. You need to be available at short notice, have a flexible schedule, and access to early morning transport. </p> <p>People of all ages, backgrounds, and physical appearances are needed, and you don't have to be good-looking. Many casting agents prefer applicants to have some SA or performing experience, but this isn't always necessary. </p> <p>A professional approach is important, says Martin Brown of Equity, the union to which many SAs belong. </p> <p>\"This isn't something that people can do on their holidays, at weekends or when they have time off from their main job. No film or TV producer is going to risk the enormous costs involved of having amateurs on set ... it is for professionals who want to make it their living.\" </p> <p>Stage actress Veronica Humphis was one of hundreds of zombie extras in last year's hit movie, Shaun of the Dead. She works part-time as a supporting artist for the extra money, and feels it is providing useful experience. </p> <p>\"Getting used to being around cameras and technical people means you wouldn't be so fazed if you landed an acting role. </p> <p>\"Being sociable is important. There are a lot of people you don't know, and it makes it much easier if you can talk to people,\" says Veronica. \"You don't need to be a good actor or be attractive to get work - but you need to have a certain look they want.\" </p> <p>But it can be very difficult to make a living out of being a supporting artist, according to SA Glen Leitch, because work can be sporadic. \"You might have three of four days one week and be very busy, but at other times only get one day's work in a fortnight. Most extras also have other jobs or careers, as well.\" </p> <p>And Glen is not his real name - the extras we spoke to didn't want their names to appear in print as it might compromise their ability to find work. </p> <p>Typical basic pay for a nine or 10-hour day is about \u00a380, or \u00a355-60 after agency commission and national insurance are deducted, and you are, of course, liable for income tax. </p> <p>The money increases if you are required to perform a \"special action\" - for example juggling or horse-riding, or if you are particularly featured in a scene. </p> <p>Overtime boosts wages, but if you are asked to work longer, you are supposed to do it. That means for any day you are booked, you have to keep the evening free in case overtime is required. </p> <p>A common grumble amongst experienced SAs is that the rate of pay has decreased in real terms over the years. </p> <p>\"Twenty years ago we would get \u00a353 cash-in-hand for a basic day,\" says Ruth Dunbar. \"On top of that, the bonuses for being featured are smaller than they used to be.\" </p> <p>Casting agents take about 15% on whatever work they get you. No agent should charge an upfront joining fee, as in April the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003 made this illegal. </p> <p>But some take a fee out of the first day's work - and this is legal. </p> <p>It means that unless you get subsequent jobs from that agency, you have worked for next to nothing. </p> <p>\"There are a hell of a lot of people who only get one or two days a year,\" says Paul Kirby, chairman of the Film Artists Association. \"It would be better to spread the cost over 10 days work. That way you would ensure that the artiste would not go below the minimum wage.\" </p> <p>Each casting agency usually has a book listing its SAs, which it sends to producers. Industry directories and websites such as Contacts, Kays (<a href=\"http://www.kays.co.uk\">kays.co.uk</a>) and The Knowledge (<a href=\"http://www.theknowledgeonline.com\">theknowledgeonline.com</a>) list casting agents. </p> <p>However, inclusion in a directory does not guarantee the quality of the agency. In recent years, undercutting by producers and agents has led to SAs sometimes ending up working for less than the going rate. </p> <p>To counter this, some of the more reputable agencies recently formed the National Association of Supporting Artistes Agents (<a href=\"http://www.nasaa.org.uk\">nasaa.org.uk</a>). It has a strict code of conduct for members and aims to raise standards across the industry so that SAs get a better deal. </p> <p>Stuart Thomell found out the hard way that you have to be wary of disrep utable casting agencies. Stuart answered an ad but was shocked when they asked for a \u00a390 joining-fee. </p> <p>A month later the agency called and asked Stuart to work half-a-day on a commercial, for \u00a350, and he said OK. </p> <p>But the job turned out to be a nightmare. \"On the shoot there were 400 of us crammed together in a small space, and we had to jump up and down to a music track. </p> <p>\"It was a hot summer's day, but we weren't even given water for three or four hours. Between filming we were told to stay in a holding room with too few seats, so we had to sit on the floor. </p> <p>\"We also had to buy our own lunch. After lunch, we were told we wouldn't get paid unless we stayed until the evening, even though it was meant to be just a half-day's work. </p> <p>\"A lot of people left when they realised they had been misled about the hours and the fee. I stayed to the end - a total of 14 hours. </p> <p>\"However, I never heard from the agency again and didn't receive any payment.\" </p> <p><strong>Swapping the blackboard for a clapperboard</strong></p> <p>One man who has made a successful career as a \"support artist\", having appeared in more than 50 films and TV programmes, is Phil Duffield. </p> <p>The 54-year-old former teacher, who splits his time between London, Basildon and South Wales, first learned about being an extra following a chance meeting at an evening class. A man he was sitting next to told him about his extra work and suggested he apply. </p> <p>\"At the start it was difficult finding work. All the agencies I approached weren't taking on new people at the time, but I eventually spotted an ad in the Stage newspaper appealing for unpaid extras. I replied and got the part,\" he says. </p> <p>His first job led him to a new agency that had just started taking on clients and after signing up he was launched straight into the big time. </p> <p>\"My first paid job was in the James Bond film The World Is Not Enough - a boat chase went straight through my fruit and veg stall. The only downside was the fact that the scene ended up on the cutting room floor and wasn't in the final film.\" </p> <p>Since then Mr Duffield has gone on to appear in the background in a host of films, commercials and TV series including Midsomer Murders and Bad Girls. </p> <p>\"It can in no way be described as a normal job. One minute you're working with a big Hollywood name, the next you're doing something incredibly mundane. And you never know what you'll be asked to do next. On some jobs you spend all day sitting around, only for your scene to be dropped at the last minute, while on others it'll all be over very quickly. On some sets you get fed, on others you need to take sandwiches - the first thing you need to pack is a good book.\" </p> <p>He is now signed on to six agencies, but the amount of work he gets varies enormously. </p> <p>\"It really depends on the state of the industry at that time. At the moment it's very quiet and I'm only getting one day a week. In the past I've worked four or five days a week - it really depends on how busy everyone is.\" </p> <p>He also says that pay varies considerably depending on where the shoot is and what it's for. His rates are typically between \u00a375 and \u00a3125 a day, but he says it averages out at around \u00a3100 a day - from which he has to pay tax (extras are generally self-employed) and the agency's 15% commission. </p> <p>\"We're no longer called extras - most people doing this work describe themselves as 'support artists'. </p> <p>\"I haven't applied for my Equity card but I think that I'm now entitled to, as I have had several speaking parts. I should stress that while it's fun at times, there is also a lot of hanging around - and you certainly couldn't rely on it as your main source of income.\"</p> <p><strong>First steps if you are looking for a walk-on part</strong></p> <p>Jobs &amp; Money asked student Selina Thompson to see whether she could find work as a film extra. Here's how she got on:</p> <p>With no acting credentials or wannabe friends to point me in the right direction, I found the internet a good place to start. There are hundreds of sites all claiming to be able help you. I found <a href=\"http://www.hiddenextra.com\">hiddenextra.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk\">thestage.co.uk</a> the best for giving me a clear breakdown of what to expect. The Hidden Extra claims to be the UK Film Extra's guide to getting into the Industry and here you will find a contact list for the top 10 casting agencies. </p> <p>It turned out that a CV and covering letter was needed before there was any chance of being offered a face-to-face registration interview. </p> <p>I also found that, typically, agencies fill up their books four to six months in advance. The FBI Agency, which has offices in Manchester, Leeds, Leicester and London, advised me to call back in March 2005 when it is starting the next round of recruitment. </p> <p>At Casting Collective I was told: \"We spend six weeks interviewing more than 2,000 people for registration. We take photos and go through your covering letter and if we think you're suitable then you will be called for future projects.\" </p> <p>I learned that standard rates for background artists (no-dialogue) working a nine-hour day start from \u00a364.10 if you're working on an ITV production and \u00a386 as a walk-on with an unscripted line. The BBC pays higher rates - \u00a391 as a walk on - but there's no guarantee who you will be working for. Flexibility is paramount in this job. </p> <p>Wages can be increased if you're hired for night work (which increases by \u00a310 a shift) and overtime is paid at time and a half if you work up to 12 hours. However, this is often a negotiable fee on independent productions. </p> <p>My advice from searching for work as an extra is to start now if you are interested in vacation work next summer. </p> <p>Physical appearance is not a problem (none of the agencies I spoke to asked for a description), so basically all it requires is plenty of agency research - ask what previous work their extras have done - and an interesting mug shot. </p>",
  "<p>Predictions of Big Brother's demise seem, rather like some of the characters in the latest series, to have been greatly exaggerated. </p> <p>After a critically panned fourth series and a rash of pale imitations, the casting of a brassy Portuguese transsexual, a Somalian former asylum seeker and a pretty-boy English rich kid has saved the show from a slow death. </p> <p>As the winner was paraded in front of a baying crowd last night, the show's producers were congratulating themselves for reviving the once-trailblazing programme, which seemed to be heading for the television history books after the somnolent fourth series. </p> <p>While ratings have not matched the highs of the third series, featuring Jade Goody and won by Kate Lawler, they are up on the low point of last year to a peak of 7.7 million before last night. Crucially, there has been much more media comment, with opinions conveniently polarised between those who believe the show to be powerfully entertaining and others who lament it as unedifyingly crass. </p> <p>While revenue from voting is down, possibly attributable to a form of voter fatigue that would be familiar to the political class, there are still plenty of financial winners: not least the showbusiness agent John Noel, who has signed up many of the contes tants to big-money tabloid deals. </p> <p>The show has undeniably given the critics plenty to get their teeth into: sex, lewd behaviour and a stand-up fight after a confrontation engineered by the producers - a situation that caused mid-series jitters at Channel 4, before order was restored. </p> <p>Big Brother naysayers have included the Labour grandee Roy Hattersley and the former Panorama reporter Tom Mangold, both of whom weighed in against the series in strong terms this week. </p> <p>Mangold, writing in the Evening Standard in London, said: \"BB has morphed into Channel 4's Frankenstein - a commercially successful juggernaut which has to become more and more outrageous in order to sustain its viewing figures. What began as a harmless little social experiment has become a monster out of control.\" </p> <p>Hattersley broadened the argument into a lament for British television in general in yesterday's Daily Mail: \"The broadcasters only have themselves to blame. They have fed the viewing public the cheap diet for so long that a new generation of viewers have come to believe that television should have nothing to do with mental activity.\" </p> <p>Peter Bazalgette, the chairman of Endemol, the production company that makes Big Brother, was scornful of the pair yesterday. </p> <p>\"It's no coincidence that most of the critics of Big Brother are old men. Older people cannot stomach younger people's lack of problem with nudity, sex and so-called bad language, and the reactions to Big Brother are obvious manifestations of that.\" </p> <p>He said the latest series had confounded and confused the critics: \"It's been enormous fun, there's been a huge amount of laughter. </p> <p>\"Think about the moments - Ahmed, the devout Muslim, apparently struggling to handle the authority of a woman, demanding that sergeant Michelle give him her jacket. And Nadia, who must have had the most unusual motive ever for taking part in Big Brother - she didn't mind that the rest of the country knew that she was a transsexual, she wanted to see if she could be accepted by an enclosed group of people on her own terms.\" </p> <p>Boyd Hilton, the TV editor of Heat magazine, said the series had overcome the problems of last year. </p> <p>\"When it started people were sounding the death knell for reality TV in general and BB in particular, saying that it had become tired and predictable and that it would die a death. The housemates have been fascinating - they started out looking like a bunch of freaks but we've got to know them as multi-faceted, real human beings. </p> <p>\"The real challenge now for Channel 4 and Endemol is keeping the show this exciting year in year out, but I think the most imaginative and clever producers in TV are working on these shows and am fully confident we'll be watching the 10th anniversary Big Brother in five years' time.\" </p> <p><strong>The highlights</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebellion</strong><br> </p> <p>Lesbian anarchist Kitten tried to be the most controversial character, but was kicked out on Day 8 for breaking the rules 34 times. Producers gave her three official warnings after she painted slogans on walls and climbed on to the roof. </p> <p><strong>Secret bedsit</strong><br> </p> <p>Big Brother fuelled tension by \"evicting\" two of the contestants - Michelle and Emma - and confining them to a bedsit, where they could eavesdrop on everything the other housemates were saying about them. </p> <p><strong>Fight night</strong><br> </p> <p>The notorious alcohol-fuelled riot on Day 20 after Emma and Michelle reappeared in the house. Security guards had to separate the warring housemates after they threatened to kill each other. Live TV coverage had to be cut for an hour -the first time in the show's history that this had happened. Emma left the house as a result of the row. </p> <p><strong>Ahmania</strong><br> </p> <p>Ahmed, a 44-year-old former asylum seeker, was the most complex character. Prone to unpredictable behaviour and angry outbursts - smashing plates on the floor and beheading Maureen, the giant papier-mch\u00e9 statue built by the housemates. Big Brother's boot-camp task disturbed him because it reminded him of living under a dictatorship in Somalia. </p> <p><strong>Revenge</strong><br> </p> <p>Stuart's treasured cowboy hat was burned in response to the housemate staging a 10-hour silent sit-in in retaliation for being denied extra food rations after they failed their weekly task. After Stuart was given a tiny replacement hat Michelle stole the Diary Room camera, buried it in straw and threatened to set it alight. </p> <p><strong>Victor: lyrical poet</strong><br> </p> <p>\"I'm Slick V-I-C, da ghetto VIP. Mess around wid me I leave you RIP. Shizzle my nizzle, you get me? </p> <p>\"Erm, one more thing, can we have two loaves of bread, one white, one brown, and some milk, please Big Brother?\" </p> <p><strong>Naked ambition</strong><br> </p> <p>Shell ran naked around the garden mowing the lawn and stripped to a pinny while preparing a BBQ. Other episodes of nakedness included a mud-wrestling competition and Jason letting Daniel lick chocolate spread from his bare bottom. </p> <p><strong>Stu and Michelle</strong><br> </p> <p>Michelle created a makeshift love nest under a table to prepare her seduction of Stuart. He was at first reluctant to join her, but after lots of persuasion they became the first couple to have sex in the Big Brother house. </p> <p><strong>Wedding bust up</strong><br> </p> <p>The public turned on Victor after his furious row with Shell, when their mock wedding left her in floods of tears and threatening to quit the show. </p> <p>He told her in his speech: \"I asked you to marry me, even though there were rumours you've been around the block more times than a tramp's dog.\" </p> <p>He later called her a \"coward\" and a \"fake\", adding: \"She's a freeloader, She's ghosting through to week 10 by kissing arse.\" </p> <p><strong>Bunny boiler</strong><br> </p> <p>Michelle earned the tag \"bunny boiler\" within days of the couple getting together. She made Stuart pose for pretend wedding pictures, banned him from going on holiday without her, and threatened to beat up his Team Handsome mates if they give his number to another girl.</p>",
  "<p>There are a number of rules to the 'interviewing game'. What makes it different to other games is that most of these commandments aren't written down anywhere. But the best piece of wisdom I can give you is \"Think like a fish\"- the sage advice handed to a colleague of mine by his grandad, along with his first rod and reel. If you want to catch a fish, you need to think like a fish, study the currents, shade and wind. And ask yourself, if you were a fish, where would you swim?</p> <p><strong>1. Test the water</strong></p> <p>Find out as much as you can (legally) about the organisation you've applied to join and the people who will be interviewing you. What's happening in the organisation at present? Check its website, look in newspapers and relevant trade magazines, talk to people who've worked for or with the organisation.</p> <p>As for the interview panel members - what can you find out about them? Which department do they work in? What interests do they have? You'll get a much better feel for the conditions in the 'water' this way. There's no guarantee that because someone on the panel works in IT that they'll ask you questions about the company's website. But if it were you, it'd be at the front of your mind, wouldn't it?</p> <p><strong>2. Swim with the fishes</strong></p> <p>See the interview from the fish's perspective. The paperwork the interviewers will have in front of them consists principally of the ad for the job and your application form. You need to know both these documents inside-out. Look again at your application form. What stands out? What are your strengths, weaknesses? Is there anything on the form that looks slightly odd? For instance, have you had an unusual job at some time? If you've been orange picking in the Andes for three months one summer, can you explain why?</p> <p><strong>3. Baiting and luring</strong></p> <p>Give the job ad another thorough examination, and any other information about the role that you've been sent. What are the criteria or skills that the interview panel is looking for? Sit down and write at least one example of how and when you've met each skill or competence required. It's so much more impressive to answer a question fully. For example, say they ask: \"So tell me about your communication skills?\" A good reply? \"Well, I believe I'm an effective communicator. An example of this was when I worked in a call centre for eight weeks in the summer and I had to deal with a number of difficult situations. For instance, once...\"</p> <p>Spend a great deal of time thinking of evidence you can bring to the panel that will show you meet the criteria. It will do wonders for your confidence. Interview panels don't want to take chances. They want to make risk-free judgements. They want solid performers, and the more evidence you bring to the table, the safer the panel will feel. They want people with ideas, of course - but more importantly, they want people with a record of turning those ideas into action.</p> <p><strong>4. Take me to the river</strong></p> <p>Do a 'reccy' of the interview location before hand. You don't want to be worrying about parking spaces, train problems or where the office is on the day of your interview.</p> <p>Do a dry run. Arrive for the interview on time. On time doesn't meet ten minutes late, nor does it mean 45 minutes early. If you're too early either the overworked secretary will feel obliged to amuse you for three-quarters of an hour or you'll have to sit in a lonely room imagining the worst and desperately wanting to go to the toilet. You will be stressed and feel that you need to go to the toilet. So go. Then when they call your name and you think you need to go again, you can reassure yourself that it's just nerves.</p> <p><strong>5. Go with the flow</strong></p> <p>At the interview, be yourself. Don't turn into Mr or Ms Serious Interview Person (unless that's who you really are). You've got the interview because of who you are - don't try to be someone different now.</p> <p><strong>6. Reel 'em in</strong></p> <p>As the interview approaches its climax - be careful. You have two options.</p> <p>If at the start you were so nervous that you talked of your experience at Microsoft but couldn't remember who Bill Gates was, explain that now along with any other factual inaccuracies - but nothing else. Alternatively a simple \"Thank you very much\" and \"Goodbye\" will suffice.</p> <p>The panel is already thinking about the next candidate, so walk out, close the door - and stop thinking like a fish.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:byron@byronkalies.co.uk\"> byron@byronkalies.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>On the face of it, film location scout would appear to be one of the more agreeable careers. It certainly seems to have the edge over, say, crime scene cleaner or Virgin Trains customer relations officer. The director outlines the sort of place he has in mind for the locations alluded to in the script and the scout hotfoots it off to find them. It's essentially salaried travel. What's not to like?</p> <p>Happily for those of us who aren't scouts, it's not all five-star hotels and beaches. For every Bond film shot in exotic destinations, there's a Mike Leigh movie that's not. For every Talented Mr Ripley, there's a Get Carter.</p> <p>\"You can't pick the locations you scout, you go with the script,\" says Lori Balton, who has worked recently on Seabiscuit and Catch Me If You Can. \"One day, it's a high-end mansion, the next, an alley in downtown Los Angeles, stepping over used condoms, needles and dead rats.\"</p> <p>And, better still, directors are notoriously awkward buggers. Simon Temple, one of the scouts on the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, says: \"You might spend days and days finding a location that you think meets the requirements and the director might just not like the look of it and tell you to find another one. There's always something that isn't quite right.\"</p> <p>Balton agrees. \"Michael Mann, for example, is notoriously exacting. Working for him on Heat is the reason I know almost every corner of Los Angeles. You could search for weeks and finally he would concede, 'This is good - now find me something better'.\" </p> <p>But the real problems don't begin until a site that meets with the director's approval has finally been settled upon. Then the location scout becomes the location manager. The location manager secures permission to film from all the relevant parties - police, councils, landowners, businesses. He sorts out access, parking and sometimes accommodation for the cast and crew. He must combine a genius for organisation with saintly diplomacy, devilish powers of persuasion and rat-like cunning. He has to be able to pacify the man from the National Trust when a brutish technician grinds chewing gum into the antique parquet floor. He has to be able to sell local residents the idea that having a 150-strong film crew camped out in their front gardens over the next seven days for a spot of night filming will be a delightful experience. He has to convince landowners that a couple of bottles of plonk are adequate payment for allowing their estate to be used by a production that will make hundreds of millions of pounds.</p> <p>\"A lot of people think it's just a case of finding a beach with a palm tree on it,\" says Terry Blyther, veteran of many movies including Gladiator and The Mummy. \"It's no problem locating the beach but then you've got to find out who owns it. Somebody different might own the palm tree. You have to bring your equipment in on ships so you end up working with the navy. Where are you going to source your food from? All of a sudden the director wants to blow up bits of the beach, then you're dealing with environmentalists about the rare turtles that live there. It would be lovely to just turn up and film but it's not like that.\" \"And if the weather fucks up, everyone tends to look at you as if that's your fault,\" adds Temple.</p> <p>Urban locations come with their own problems. The 33-foot Winnebago trailer that most stars regard as standard can be difficult to park in certain areas of London. And traffic is another issue. Veteran location managers become dewy-eyed over the memory of days when a donation to a policeman's favourite charity, given to the rozzer himself for safekeeping, could ensure that London was sealed off for hours. No longer.</p> <p>\"The capital is a very difficult place to film,\" says Nick Daubeny, location manager on a list of pictures as long as your arm. Harry Potter, scourge of the Dark Lord, Voldemort, very nearly came a cropper at the hands of a traffic cop from south London. \"We wanted to use Lambeth Bridge for part of the knight bus sequence in Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban,\" says Daubeny. \"We had a meeting with Westminster police, Lambeth police and Transport For London and everything was going well until some policeman from Merton turned up and said it was illegal to close the bridge. The meeting ended in disarray and it took a lot of work before we were granted permission to shut it for four minutes while we shot the sequence.\"</p> <p>David Broder, currently working on the big-screen version of Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy, says: \"On Enigma, it took six months of negotiation to close Trafalgar Square and turn it into a 1940s set. Six months of planning for a few hours shooting one bank holiday Monday morning.\" Which translated into 15 seconds of footage at the start of the movie and 90 at the end.</p> <p>But no amount of planning can account for eventualities like being linked with the antichrist. \"While I was working on Interview With The Vampire, the Church of England saw an interview with Anne Rice and decided that the film was blasphemous and anti-Christian,\" Daubeny says.</p> <p>\"Churches were told not to help us in any way. I managed to find one called St Paul's in Deptford where the vicar didn't know we were persona non grata. We filmed there but it was very nerve-racking because we never knew if he was going to get a call telling him to kick us out.\"</p> <p>\"I worked on High Crimes starring Morgan Freeman,\" says Hollywood-based Scott Trimble. \"There's a scene near the start where Ashley Judd and Jim Caviezel are walking through San Francisco's Union Square. There are a lot of ritzy stores there and it took three months of negotiations to ensure that we had access to their balconies for our cameras, that their lights were going to be left on, and so on.</p> <p>\"On the night we were finally due to shoot, Ashley Judd was sick and couldn't work. We had to cancel everything, pack up and start renegotiating.\"</p> <p>Film folk like to bellyache about their work - the long hours, the boredom, the sheer hard physical labour - but they're not fooling anyone. We all know location management is a damn sight more fulfilling than our hamster-wheel jobs. \"A few weeks ago I was kayaking up a Russian river, looking for a place for the kimono maker's studio for Memoirs Of A Geisha,\" says Lori Balton. \"That was heaven.\"</p> <p>\"My most satisfying work was for Onegin where we had to shoot Russia in the UK,\" reveals Daubeny. \"I found some silver birch woods off the A3 and a house called Northington Grange in Hampshire. When the Russian producer came over he said they had as much essence of Russia as anything you could find in Russia itself.\"</p> <p>Blyther says: \"A highlight of my career was finding a location which had never been filmed before - Bourne Woods in Surrey, used for the opening battle in Gladiator. Best bit of the film I reckon.\" </p> <p> <strong>Location, Location, Location</strong></p> <p>Tony Reeves, author of The Worldwide Guide To Movie Locations (Titan Books), compiled this list of the most overused locations in the UK. The same ones crop up again and again and again. Here's a selection.</p> <p> <strong>King's Cross Gasometeres, London </strong></p> <p>\"The gasometers actually disappeared recently but just behind King's Cross Station there was a wonderful area of cobbled streets and 19th century industrial buildings,\" says Reeves.

  "<p>When the curtain rose on Verdi's A Masked Ball at London's Coliseum in February 2000, the audience saw 14 men sitting on lavatories in transparent cubicles with their trousers round their ankles. It was an iconic moment in the history of the English National Opera, raising cries of \"vandalism\" in the tabloid press. The defection of a leading tenor from the cast and tales of onstage nudity and homosexual rape fuelled the media fury.</p> <p>Fast-forward to June this year, when seven performances of Mozart's Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail at the Komische Oper in Berlin took the art-as-pornography issue to an even higher level. What is usually a charming, ironic opera about Christian women held in a Turkish harem was transformed into a hyper-realistic Berlin brothel scenario with fetishism, masturbation, urinating (singer on singer) and nipple-slicing. Subscribers and sponsors were outraged. Critics in the broadsheets hailed a masterpiece.</p> <p>The director of these alleged farragoes is a mild-mannered, serious and fiercely intelligent 40-year-old Catalan from Barcelona called Calixto Bieito, who has made an extraordinary reputation for himself in Britain in the past seven years as \"the Quentin Tarantino of opera\", and Europe's \"most over-the-top director\".</p> <p>Modern opera has always had its bad boys, of course, but Bieito comes with the additional, unselfconscious agenda of the post-Franco performing arts in Spain, which is one of vehement sexual candour and political anarchy 10 or 15 years after the rest of us.</p> <p>We see this explosive cultural impact in the explicit, blasphemous and increasingly tender movies of Pedro Almod\u00f3var and the sometimes overwhelming theatrical productions of Catalan head-banging companies such as Els Joglars who, in 1978, three years after the death of Franco, were accused of insulting the army and sent to prison; and Fura del Baus, who once appeared at the ICA in London smashing up cars. Last year Fura pushed the envelope even further at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith by simulating, and apparently stimulating, sexual intercourse on stage in XXX (which returns to the Edinburgh fringe this week).</p> <p>Bieito relates in many ways to this sort of theatrical activity but is far more engaged in overhauling and renovating the traditional repertoire. His vivid productions have electrified audiences and challenged the critics. He is both proud Catalan and committed European. For the past four years he has run Barcelona's oldest theatre, the beautiful Teatre Romea in the heart of the Gothic barrio just off the Ramblas and, since his British debut with a stunning zarzuela (Spanish lyrical opera) at the Edinburgh Festival in 1997, has become increasingly embedded in our own theatrical activity in London, Leeds and Newcastle, as well as in Edinburgh.</p> <p>Although he has had film offers, his schedule has not allowed him to pursue them. Like so many great theatre directors - Richard Jones, Peter Brook, Giorgio Strehler and Patrice Ch\u00e9reau - he brings a true cineaste's eye for pace, visual fluency and \"choice of shot\" to his stage compositions. Brian McMaster, director of the Edinburgh Festival, believes it is \"incredibly important that his work is seen here\".</p> <p>One of the striking qualities in that first Edinburgh zarzuela, La Verbena de la paloma, was its grittiness. Another was its lighting. It felt real and looked gorgeous. We saw it in Edinburgh because McMaster, holidaying in Barcelona two years earlier, was driven into the Teatro Tivoli by the rain and was instantly enchanted. \"This was not the usual frilly froth you might expect in a zarzuela but a story of young people for whom love triumphs over money and material values in a poor barrio in Madrid. He is undoubtedly one of the most interesting theatre makers of our time. His theatre is so alive. And he is an entrancing human being.\"</p> <p>Bieito is of average height and stocky build, slightly stooping, mercurial in mood, his shaven head always leading him round corners, real and imagined. He speaks five languages, was educated by the Jesuits and grew up in a musical household - his mother was an amateur singer, his brother teaches in the Barcelona conservatoire. He exists in a state of perpetual motion and usually wears black.</p> <p>He was born in a small town in northern Spain, Mirande de Ebro, and moved with his family to Barcelona when he was 14. While his musical mother pestered him constantly about piano practice, his father, a railway engineer - \"he was nothing to do with art, he was a very tolerant man, working class, very pure\" - simply shared with him his love of great voices and the zarzuela tradition. His uncle and several cousins, as well as his brother, were all musicians.</p> <p>\"Every Sunday a band played in my little town and at school I was in a Vivaldi performance playing the snow in The Four Seasons. At college, the Jesuits were very severe. But a Catholic background has many good and many bad things.\" (He breaks off into a wild cackle of laughter.) \"You learn a lot about black humour with the Jesuits. By the time I was 12 I didn't believe in God. I couldn't understand why you had to go to the priest to declare your sins. And I couldn't believe because I saw the sexuality with the Jesuits. Some of the priests, they... how do you say... (he strokes his own arm)... caress.\"</p> <p>At university he studied history of art and philology and remembers the impact of seeing the soprano Montserrat Caballe in a concert version of Tannh\u00e4user at the Liceu in Barcelona, the great opera house - literally round the corner from his own Romea headquarters - where he will direct Alban Berg's Woyzeck next year. Deciding to direct plays, his student reputation led him straight to directing Shakespeare and Goldoni at Barcelona's summer festival in the late 1980s.</p> <p>Supported by a Spanish government bursary, Bieito then travelled throughout Europe and met and worked with some of the great names in world theatre: Peter Brook in Paris, Ingmar Bergman in Stockholm, the reclusive Polish guru Jerzy Grotowski, Giorgio Strehler in Milan. Strehler's Piccolo Theatre was important to Bieito: \"I did a workshop there with the actors, and for the first time I felt I could do something special. Strehler was a big director, but it's not my style; it's the director as a matador, shouting at actors... no, I'm not a democrat as a director necessarily, but it's different. We are a team. I have the ideas, but we are working together. I am paid for my ideas and I say what we do...\"</p> <p>He forged his own style, he reckons, while working on a wide variety of plays in Barcelona in the early 1990s, including Shakespeare's King John, Moli\u00e8re's Amphitryon and Shaw's Mrs Warren's Profession. If style in acting, as John Gielgud said, is knowing the type of play you are in, style in directing is surely about working through the entrails of the play or opera in question and releasing the inner life with both understanding and a recognisable signature. All the great directors do this, and Bieito is on his way to join them, while the row rages on about interpretation versus gratuitous sensationalism.</p> <p>He is now in his fourth season at the Romea, having worked in all the theatres in Barcelona, and the National Theatre in Madrid, before laying down new roots near his old roots. \"When I was offered the Romea four or five years ago I decided to stay here. It is good here for me and my family. My son is going to the British school with all the European children. He is already speaking in Catalan, English and Spanish. I think the future with culture is to make a strong identity but also to be open to other cultures, and to speak other languages. The concept of Europe is very important because Europe is not so big. We should have strong identities but also strong links.\"</p> <p>On the eve of May Day in Barcelona this year, he was poised between rehearsals of King Lear with his own actors, and a flight to Berlin to begin work on the Mozart production. He was simultaneously planning a new production of Celestina by Fernando de Rojas for the Edinburgh Festival and was due in a few days' time at the Ruhr Festival to oversee his touring production of The Threepenny Opera. On this particular Friday night, his partner, the petite and fiery actress Roser Cami, was ill at home in the suburbs north of the city with their three-year-old son, and he needed to see them for a few hours.</p> <p>First, though, he showed me round the auditorium which was extensively renovated in 1991. There are 600 seats, two horse-shoe circles with handsome wrought iron and a wooden-panelled interior that yields the most perfect acoustics. The front-of-house area is warm and welcoming, with a bar that provides delicious tapas, beers and coffee in a relaxed atmosphere. Members of the audience talk to each other constantly during the play.</p> <p>In the uncluttered whiteness of his office at the Teatre Romea, he explained that theatre \"can create a new spirit and hold a mirror up to nature, as Shakespeare says. It has to say something about society now, about the facts, and about emotions and solutions to what is going on.\" It is Bieito's unshakeable creed that every old play and opera should be performed as a new play and opera and that the true criterion is not how it stands up to past interpretations, or to its reputation, but how it speaks to us today.</p> <p>He leaned forward over his desk and glared: \"I am a modern man because I am living now and I like to be close to the mentality of the people, to what is going on in the street, in fashion, in music, in all aspects of culture...\"</p> <p>In March this year he attended the first night in Leeds of a co-production between his own theatre, the West Yorkshire Playhouse, and Northern Stage (in Newcastle) of George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia. He moved quickly and easily around the throng, greeting old friends, darting looks in all directions. Josep Galindo, his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and assistant, was responsible for the production, which matched five British actors with five Catalans in a brilliant adaptation of Orwell's mesmerising account of the Spanish civil war through direct address, film footage, and a series of stage \"atmospheres\" conjured in an art gallery accumulation of bottles, boots, books, clothes and even oranges. \"Josep will be a fantastic director,\" he enthuses. \"This was his first solo production: I can leave him now for the next generation!\" </p> <p>A few weeks later, Bieito was in the UK again, at Stratford-upon-Avon, to take part in the Royal Shakespeare Company's open day over the bard's birthday weekend. In the light, airy rehearsal room at the top of the Swan Theatre, he talks about his outrageously cut-up production of Macbeth that visited the Barbican Theatre in London two years ago and in which the Guardian's Michael Billington detected the cinematic influences of Francis Ford Coppola, Federico Fellini and Almod\u00f3var.</p> <p>\"Macbeth,\" Bieito tells an audience of about 200 eager Shakespeareans, \"has to be a new piece by a new writer. We changed the text all the time. The fifth act is my favourite. It is like the last days in the bunker. We gave Lady Macduff five children. Macbeth did not die at the end. He stays with all his ghosts. Death, we know, is for heroes. Always with Shakespeare you can do whatever you want. All you must do is surprise the audience. The text is not the limit. This is theatre. There is no limit.\"</p> <p>This is the sort of declaration that leaves critics feeling superfluous. If theatre is just about creating something immediate, unimaginable and exciting, a critic is left shooting into an undefended goal. Because, if the answer to the question, \"Does an interpretative artist have any literal responsibility or obligation to the work of a dead creative artist?\" is \"No, not in the theatre; stay home in the library with the text and the CDs if you don't like dirt, daring and imperfection,\" then a critic flounders helplessly, trapped inside his own puny sense of indignation.</p> <p>Opera critic Hugh Canning takes issue with this, and with Bieito's shock tactics. \"He's teeming with good ideas, half of which need to be thrown away. I liked his Masked Ball for its great visceral energy, though he missed all the humour in the piece, as most modern directors do. But his Cos\u00ec fan tutte for Welsh National Opera was not remotely funny, and by making the two girls 'slags' from the outset, he made a nonsense of the Mozartian comedy which requires them to pretend to be out of character when they switch lovers.</p> <p>\"In order to get noticed as an opera director these days, especially in Germany, where there are 50 houses competing for critical attention, you have to create some kind of scandal,\"adds Canning. \"I don't mean this to sound like an anti-Bieito reaction of some old fuddy-duddy. It's not. It's all about finding the correct register for each opera. Cos\u00ed is a subtle piece, dealing in shades of emotion, not 'Wham, Bam, Thank You Ma'am', which is what we got in Cardiff.\"</p> <p>A Don Giovanni for ENO, with the Don portrayed as a gun-toting, lecherous, hallucinating junkie, was similarly disliked by the critics. It was bloody, brutal and sexy, certainly. But there was plenty, paradoxically, to please the open-hearted viewer, including, in this case, Martin Hoyle of Time Out, who commented on \"the brilliant touch of the Don singing his serenade down a mobile phone, fading into emotional emptiness that erupts into rage as he sweeps the bottles and glasses off the bar: already in hell?\"</p> <p>What some people find gratuitous in Bieito's work others can find revelatory and intriguing. Nothing he does is without dramatic point or purpose. A Masked Ball was true to Verdi in suggesting a political analogy with Spain in the 1970s in the same way Verdi used the original Swedish setting to mask his own commitment to Italian liberation from the Habsburgs.</p> <p>Those chaps on toilet seats were underground political plotters. The music and the scenography then lifted us up into the parliament. The New Statesman denounced the doorless cubicles as a cheap steal from Eisenstein's Strike and the gun in the toilet as ditto from The Godfather. Bieito himself claims to invoke the surreal tradition of an artist such as Picabia or a film-maker like Luis Bu\u00f1uel who, in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, shows a family eating their meal while seated on the lavatory. \"My heroes are Bu\u00f1uel, obviously,\" he told Opera magazine two years ago, \"but also Fellini, whose work is like an endless dream, Kurosawa, Antonioni, Coppola, Scorsese, Spielberg and, latterly, Baz Luhrman. I loved his Moulin Rouge for its fast editing and bravura technique.\"</p> <p>After his Edinburgh success in 1997, he jumped at McMaster's invitation to return to Edinburgh the following year and directed a new version of Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca's Life Is A Dream, a Spanish golden-age classic about an imprisoned prince whose father has been swayed by bad omens. The British cast, led by Scottish actor George Anton (who played Bieito's Hamlet at the 2003 festival) set about John Clifford's new text with delightful gusto on a black cinder track of a set with a huge, tilting mirror.</p> <p>Anton relished \"the freedom\" of their work together: \"He has a better imagination than a child. He keeps talking through rehearsals; he's like a boxing coach more than anything. He's very clever when he needs to be, but he's such a humble person - he's got no ego. He's like a kid in a toy shop and now that he's got even more success, it's refreshing to see that he hasn't changed.\"</p> <p>The critical reception of Life Is A Dream was almost universally positive and a key moment in Bieito's career: \"This was the first time I did the play, and I understood it so much better because of the British actors. They were uninhibited by its reputation and they were so good, and so fast, and they tried to seduce the audience with the play. We did it all in two hours. This was fantastic for me because it was like a new piece. And afterwards I did it in Spain. It was very controversial, won all the awards, and a whole new young audience came to see it.\"</p> <p>This year he returns to Edinburgh with two shows, Verdi's Il Trovatore and a brand new version of Celestina (again, his translator is Clifford). Verdi's opera is about murder, abduction and torture, and almost inevitably the festival brochure carries a health warning to the effect that \"some people may be upset by scenes of a graphic nature\". McMaster saw the first night in Hanover and counts it as one of the most exciting performances he has ever seen. \"It's very violent, in some ways alienating - people were running for the exits after only 10 minutes - but Calixto has this gift of making the whole thing so tremendously alive. And the cast all adore him. I've never seen backstage loyalty and euphoria like it. It's quite phenomenal.\"</p> <p>And as Celestina deals in seduction, treachery, lust and the callous manipulation of two doomed lovers - the whole unruly 21-act play is like Shakespeare laced with the darker passages of John Webster - no one will be expecting a pleasant diversion after dinner. Clifford says he and Bieito are not so much modernising the script as respecting the strangeness, and pre-modernity of De Rojas: \"The modern novel would not exist without this play. The language is rich and beautiful. And having the old procuress as the heroine [a role to be taken by Kathryn Hunter, last year's Richard III at the Globe in London] is of course utterly revolutionary.\"</p> <p>Celestina, like Don Quixote and Don Juan, is one of the larger-than-life reprehensible mythical characters whom not even Franco could keep quiet. For Bieito - who read the original play with the Jesuits and wrote about it for one of his university theses - to be directing it for the first time in English is a big deal indeed. The production will almost certainly fetch up in Barcelona at the Teatre Romea, where the repertoire is geared to Bieito's ambition of creating a truly international theatre.</p> <p>The current Romea season has included plays by Shakespeare, Arthur Miller, Henrik Ibsen, Fernando Arrabal, Thomas Bernhard and David Hare. And it is an almost totally commercially run operation: about 5% of the overall budget comes from the public purse. Bieito is employed by the board to run a popular theatre with an adventurous policy. And his collaborations with theatres in Leeds, Newcastle, Paris and Edinburgh are as much to do with commercial realities as idealistic impulses. There is also a Romea Foundation for young writers, with an award for Best Play every two years. Bieito's next scheduled Romea production after King Lear - never before seen in Barcelona - is a contemporary drama by a Moroccan writer, Ahmed Ghazali, to be performed in a polylingual brew of Catalan, French, English and Arabic.</p> <p>Bieito staged a David Hare mini-festival in his theatre last year as part of his ongoing engagement with foreign repertoire. As well as a full production of Skylight (in which Cami played the teacher whose son tries to instigate a reconciliation with his father), there were readings of other Hare pieces, and a performance by the playwright of his own monodrama about visiting Israel, Via Dolorosa.</p> <p>Hare was bowled over by the experience: \"By chance it was the 200th performance of Via Dolorosa. It was done with Catalan surtitles to more or less the most cultured and intelligent audience I've ever played to anywhere. You got the feeling of a theatre which was at the very centre of a particular culture, and firing on all guns. The whole festival was a huge success - there were press conferences, parties, God knows what - and a general atmosphere of seriousness towards theatre which you find only in the very best places. A wholly good experience - and at the centre a disarmingly modest, decent and honourable man.</p> <p>\"We talked a bit about his reputation as an enfant terrible. He says it's only in England that people behave as though the 20th century never happened... My impression is that he wants his theatre to be political, and he is simply frustrated by the absence of a political approach at all on the contemporary Spanish stage. To meet, anyway, and to work with, he's as nice as they come. And when he says he's going to do something, he does it. A rare quality.\"</p> <p>In May this year, Bieito flew to Newcastle to attend the last performance of Homage to Catalonia. The Playhouse was closing for a 15-month period of rebuilding - and in the afternoon, Sting, local-lad-made-good, unfurled a banner proclaiming \"A new home for international theatre in Newcastle\". Alan Lyddiard, the artistic director, is embarking on a five-year plan of collaboration with Bieito that might well involve Bieito directing another co-production, this time with the Royal Shakespeare Company, in 2007.</p> <p>Bieito went up onto the stage, says Lyddiard, and gave an impromptu speech. He was visibly moved when he spoke about their work together, something reflected in the transcript as he summarised his commitment: \"We believe in a theatre where countries' identities are very strong but where the theatre is open, completely open to Europe, to an exchange of cultures... this is a very strong idea in Catalonia, I think that Teatre Romea is the only theatre doing that and I think Northern Stage is a rare example in Britain... I think this is the point of the iceberg. It is fantastic, I must say I am full of emotion.\"</p> <p>When King Lear opened in Barcelona last month, with an actor Bieito describes as \"the Michael Gambon of Spain\" in the leading role, the director was mischievously concerned that his local audience would think he was up to his old tricks again by killing off so many characters in the cast. \"They will not know the play and they will say I killed everyone!\" More dark cackles.</p> <p>But he need not have worried. King Lear is a violent, disturbing play to start with, and the critics have hailed a modern dress, contemporary production imaginatively true to a great work of art. Desecration is so often the flipside of celebration, and it seems likely that Bieito's long-haul campaign of working combustibly through both processes will, in the end, win through to full recognition.</p> <p> <strong>Born: </strong> November 2, 1963, Miranda de Ebro.<br><strong>Education:</strong> 1980-85<strong> </strong> University of Barcelona (Spanish Philology and History of Art); the Drama School of Tarragona; Theatre Institute of Barcelona.<br><strong>Family:</strong> Roser Cami, one son, Adria, born 2001.<br><strong>Some productions:</strong> 1989 The Lovers by Goldoni at Mercat de les Flors, Barcelona; '96 La verbena de la Paloma at Tivoli, Barcelona; '97 Company by Sondheim at Teatre Lliure, Barcelona; '98 Life is a Dream at Edinburgh Festival; 2000 Cosi fan tutte at Welsh National Opera; '02 Macbeth at Teatro Romea, Barcelona; '03 The Threepenny Opera at Bobigny, Paris; Il Trovatore at Staatsoper Hanover.<br><strong> Some prizes: </strong> 2000 Premio Ercillo for Life is a Dream, Irish Times best director award for Barbaric Comedies; '03 Glasgow Herald outstanding artist award for Hamlet at the Edinburgh Festival.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Celestina will preview at Birmingham Rep on August 11-12 (0121 236 4455).

  "<p>Love, by Toni Morrison (Vintage, \u00a36.99) </p> <p> Fans of the Pulitzer and Nobel prize-winning Toni Morrison should be delighted with her latest novel, with its strong characters, intricate, moving story and a plot that gradually unravels with pleasing symmetry. At the centre is Bill Cosey, charming bon vivant and proprietor of Cosey's Hotel and Resort, \"the best-known vacation spot for coloured folk on the East Coast\". Around him are the five Cosey women - cook, lover, daughter-in-law, granddaughter and second wife - all vying for the old man's favour. His death at 81 causes an unseemly squabble over his will, establishing some of the women as fierce enemies and prompting this elegiac disquisition on the nature of love. Morrison writes eloquently about the heady first rush of lust and the soothing acquiescence of loyalty, but spoils it with her treatment of the relationship between an old man and his 11-year-old bride. That Morrison looks on this old goat with fond indulgence mars an otherwise admirable book. <strong>ES</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The Rules of Engagement, by Anita Brookner (Penguin, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p> Two friends - same name, shared Belgravia childhood. It's the 1960s, and while Betsy goes off to Paris to find love and adventure, Elizabeth stays in London for the safety of marriage to an older man. Anita Brookner's 22nd novel shuns the obvious route, following not the drama of the woman given over to her emotions, but the pathos of the one who keeps hers firmly under control. Elizabeth admires the brave women of Victorian literature and calls Betsy a Little Dorrit. For herself, she accepts the sobriety and dullness of her marriage as a \"necessary virtue\" but admits she is \"a disgrace to my generation... born a little too early to appreciate the fact that I was free to please myself\". It is almost unbearably sad to watch this \"polite relic, all fires put out\" languishing in her flat day after day, waiting for each afternoon to end. Elizabeth's waste of a life would be tragic were it not so complacent. An elegant, if enervating, novel. <strong> ES</strong> </p> <p> <strong> The American Boy, by Andrew Taylor (Harper Perennial, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p> When Thomas Shield takes a job as master at a Stoke Newington boys' school in the autumn of 1819, he is just a young man with little money, few connections and a lot of frustrated sexual energy. Within weeks, he is embroiled in the affairs of the Frant family: tutor to the son, informant to the father, in love with the mother. But when a bludgeoned body is found on a building site, Shield turns amateur sleuth. Was Frant senior really killed, or did he stage his death? Who is the tall stranger with the transatlantic brogue? And where does Frant junior's schoolfriend, Edgar Allan Poe, fit in? Andrew Taylor's latest crime novel is full of period colour and unexpected twists. At times, the plot (which involves a British banking firm and its illegal arms trade in America) gets a little too convoluted, and Taylor's habit of ending each short chapter on a cliffhanger a little too melodramatic. But that should not deter aficionados of the genre. <strong> ES</strong> </p> <p> <strong> A Sweet Obscurity, by Patrick Gale (Harper Perennial, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p> Patrick Gale writes that Cornwall \"is all very well if you're content to grow broccoli or write novels\". He ought to know, given that he lives on a 200-acre Cornish holding from which he plots his wistful celebrations of West Country life. A Sweet Obscurity is an unashamedly sentimental romance which incorporates an academic treasure-hunt to give it a bit of intellectual heft. Eliza is a depressed scholar of early music, whose retreat to Cornwall causes her to stumble across a lost madrigal. The owner of the madrigal happens to be a lonely farmer who trundles up and down in his tractor listening to Woman's Hour. Gale hits a few high notes, drawing out the contrast between the seclusions of agricultural life and the twittery companionship of the hey-nonny crowd. But he does so at such excessive length that the narrative begins to feel over-boiled and soggy. I wonder what his broccoli's like? <strong>AH</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Girl in a Garden, by Lesley Chamberlain (Atlantic, \u00a37.99)</strong> </p> <p> \"Time happens slowly for children,\" Chamberlain states in her opening sentence. \"Everything passes in slow and painful detail.\" So here are the painfully slow and detailed observations of suburban life in the summer of 1961, as recounted by 11-year-old Linka, a scabby-kneed tomboy who frequently takes her clothes off for romps in the wood. Chamberlain is good at evoking the wonderment of 60s technology: the TV set that looked like \"the very thick glasses of a boy at school\" or the record player which her mother crouched over \"like a gorgeous bird laying an egg\" - though, like these ancient valve-powered items, her narrative seems to take an inordinately long time to warm up. It eventually settles into an eloquent, if ephemeral, evocation of budding adolescence - rather too budding in parts, such as when Linka notices her nipples, \"rounded, hard and opaline, as if nature had spun around both the corona and the berry a translucent cocoon\". A trip to the lingerie department for you, young lady. <strong> AH</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Crossing the Lines, by Melvyn Bragg (Sceptre, \u00a36.99)</strong> </p> <p> The third of Bragg's semi-autobiographical series features Joe, a diligent teenager whose mind opens opportunities beyond his beloved Cumbria. He wonders about God and girls, tries to train his hair into a DA and reads everything he can. Leisure is beer and skiffle, and covert enjoyment of Beethoven on the Third Programme. His relationship with jet-haired Rachel develops from strong kissing to adoration, and conversations with his parents are compact with loving resentments. Like the characters in Alan Bennett's The History Boys, Joe stumbles between the liberation of free thought and swanking through exams. He wins a scholarship to Oxford and tries to mould himself into a proper Oxford man - tolerating sherry, a pipe and a suit of clerical grey. Bragg makes every nuance of cash and cringe of accent count. Even so, it's a great slab of a novel, and at this rate it'll be another five books before Joe reaches The South Bank Show. DJ</p>",
  "Nottinghamshire police have found a shotgun hidden in the home of Chanel Taylor, whose father is on the run after being named as the suspect for her murder. <p>Experts are expected to say soon whether gun is the one used to shoot Mrs Taylor, 23, in the head seven weeks after her wedding. </p> <p>Detectives said it was found during a room by room search of Mrs Taylor's rented terrace house in Huthwaite village, near Mansfield. An earlier search had failed to find it. </p> <p>Local people had been warned that Mrs Taylor's father Terry Rodgers, 55, might be in hiding with a shotgun he is known to have owned illegally. </p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Paul Cottee, who is leading the murder inquiry, said the house had been sealed since Lee Taylor, 22, found his wife's body at lunchtime on Friday last week. </p> <p>He said: \"Every inch of every room has subject to a thorough forensic examination: the house is a crime scene and rooms must be searched consecutively. This is done to ensure we can gather as much forensic evidence as possible so that nothing is missed. </p> <p>\"As the shotgun was not found in a visible position, scenes of crime officers were not alerted to its presence until its precise location was examined yesterday.\" </p> <p>The police published 500 wanted posters with a picture of Mr Rodgers, the former owner of a security business, warning people not to approach him. </p> <p>He had recently moved in with his daughter and son-in-law, leaving the caravan where he had lived after the breakdown his marriage and the sale of his company. </p> <p>Friends said that he had tried to kill himself after these events with a cocktail of pills and drink, but was found by Mrs Taylor at an embankment near her home. </p> <p>Detectives are checking 50 unconfirmed sightings of Mr Rodgers, who is believed to be on the run to the east of the M1 between Mansfield and Hucknall. </p> <p>In the same area the police are seeking a former miner, Robert Boyer, who is wanted for questioning about the killing of Keith Frogson, 62, in the village of Annesley Woodhouse, possibly related to a bitter quarrel over the 1984-5 coal strike.

  "A UN prosecutor and human rights groups called for international action yesterday after an Indonesian appeal court quashed the four outstanding convictions of members of the country's security forces prosecuted for their alleged involvement in violence in East Timor in 1999. <p>An international commission of experts appointed by the UN should assess the judicial processes in Jakarta and East Timor to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice, the human rights groups said. </p> <p>It is estimated about 1,500 people were killed, 250,000 forcibly moved into Indonesian West Timor and almost all the territory's infrastructure destroyed during a UN-organised referendum in which the East Timorese voted to end Indonesia's 24-year occupation. </p> <p>The court's decision, made last month but confirmed yesterday, means of the 18 people indicted for crimes against humanity, only two, both East Timorese civilians, have had their convictions upheld. </p> <p>Indonesian prosecutors could appeal to the supreme court but they are not expected to do so. </p> <p>The serious crimes unit in East Timor, funded and staffed by the UN, has indicted 373 people. About 280 of these are at large in Indonesia including General Wiranto, the military chief at the time. </p> <p>More than 50 members of the militias Jakarta created to disrupt the referendum and several East Timorese members of the Indonesian security forces have been convicted and jailed in East Timor. </p> <p>Nicholas Koumjian, a UN-appointed prosecutor for serious crimes in East Timor, said Indonesia had failed to demonstrate its commitment to uphold human rights and the rule of law. </p> <p>\"The international community should now act to make sure impunity is not allowed to continue,\" he told the Guardian. </p> <p>\"It should take a look at what happened and judge the process both in East Timor and Indonesia.\" </p> <p>Amnesty International and Tapol, a campaign group for victims of alleged Indonesian oppression, said the UN should provide \"meaningful justice for the victims\". </p> <p>Amnesty told the Guardian: \"The trials and appeals in Indonesia have been flawed from the very start. The UN must ensure that its commitment to bring the perpetrators of human rights abuses to justice is fulfiled. Amnesty calls on the UN secretary general to set up an international commission of experts.\" </p> <p>Paul Barber of Tapol called the decision a \"travesty\". </p> <p>\"The UN, which has ultimate responsibility for justice must now evaluate the steps taken and consider alternative judicial mechanisms, including the establishment of an international tribunal for East Timor,\" he said. </p> <p>Diplomats say an international commission, which is thought to have the support of Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, is unlikely to be established, if at all, before Indonesia swears in its first directly elected president in late October. </p> <p>East Timor's government is opposed to an international tribunal. In the interests of good neighbourly relations, it prefers to focus on reconciliation. </p> <p>The four officers who have had their convictions overturned include the regional military commander at the time, Major General Adam Damiri. He has since played an important role in Jakarta's 15-month offensive against separatists in Aceh, northern Sumatra. Another officer, Colonel Noer Muis, is teaching an ethics course at the army's staff college. </p> <p>Colonel Yani Basuki, a military spokesman, said the armed forces had not interfered in the judgment. \"We respect the rule of law and let the judicial process take its course,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Of course we think this was the correct verdict.\" </p> <p>The judges also halved the 10-year sentence given to a militia leader Eurico Guterres. He and the former civilian governor, Abilio Soares, are the two East Timorese whose convictions were upheld. </p> <p><b>The price of freedom</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Violence erupted in 1999, with Indonesian troops and militias blamed for deaths of approximately 1,500 civilians, forcing 250,000 people into Indonesian West Timor and destroying much of the region's infrastructure after East Timorese voted for independence </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Eighteen people indicted by Indonesia's tribunal into the violence.

  "It could almost make a Spielberg movie. Plucky Danny DeVito joins forces with Dustin Hoffman to defend their beachfront homes against the encroaching mob. When their efforts are thwarted by the state, they turn to suave Pierce Brosnan to be their saviour. The film ends with the Bond actor skipping through the waves, hand in hand with Goldie Hawn. <p>It sounds too unlikely to be true, but elements of this drama are being played out on a Malibu beach. And unlike fiction, all the stars are playing themselves. </p> <p>Broad Beach in Malibu is an exclusive strip of beach 30 miles up the coast from Los Angeles. A line of large, luxurious houses faces the sea, separated from the water by 20 metres of sand. </p> <p>Tables and deckchairs are arranged expectantly in front of the houses, maids dust windowsills and gardeners rake leaves. Architectural features abound. </p> <p>The view from the road at the back of the houses is rather different. From Broad Beach Road the homes of the stars block even the tiniest glimpse of the beach. Each property butts up against the others, forming a barrier that deters all but the most determined of visitors. Two public footpaths, difficult to spot for the uninitiated, lead down to the sea. </p> <p>Frank Sinatra had a home on the mile-long strip of sand that forms Broad Beach, as did Walter Matthau. Now it is home to Steven Spielberg, DeVito, Hoffman, Brosnan, Hawn, Robert Redford and others. </p> <p>Not that they actually live there. In most cases the homes are holiday homes. When a fire threatened in 1993 and the area was evacuated, only a quarter of the houses were inhabited. </p> <p>Now the desire of the stars and their wealthy neighbours to protect their privacy is clashing with the desire of the public to enjoy the beach, and the remit of California's Coastal Commission to protect coastal resources, including public access to beaches. </p> <p>The result is an unseemly public spat. The homeowners' association has posted signs warning that the beach is private property, and employs security guards who patrol on bright ATVs to ensure that nobody strays on to the sand. </p> <p>Should they find a miscreant sunbather - or worse still, a surfer - the offender is politely warned to move on, or face the full force of the California penal code. </p> <p>But the Coastal Commission, prompted by what it says is an unprecedented level of complaints from the public, argues that the homeowners are in breach of the law, and has told them to remove the signs and instruct the guards not to move people on. It has also published a document on its website detailing with aerial photographs which areas of the beach are public and which are private property. </p> <p>\"The beach should not be private, the beach should belong to everybody,\" says the coastal commissioner, Sara Wan. </p> <p>She drew attention to the situation at Broad Beach last year when she visited armed with legal documents proving she had the right to sit on the sand. When the security guards tried to move her on she refused to budge. </p> <p>\"For a number of years I had been receiving calls from members of the public complaining,\" she says. \"This situation is not unique to Broad Beach, but the homeowners have these signs and guards which makes it more confrontational. </p> <p>\"The signs are confusing and misleading. They're using the signs to intimidate people into never using the beach. And the use of guards to keep the public off areas is not legitimate.\" </p> <p>The signs are certainly confusing. Posted every 30 metres along the beach at the high-tide mark they proclaim: \"Private property. Do not trespass. Private property begins 30 feet toward the ocean from this sign.\" (The figure varies for each sign.) </p> <p>This leads to the inescapable conclusion that the public part of the beach starts at least nine metres into the sea, making sunbathing problematic at best. But California law states that the public area starts at the high-tide line. </p> <p>The situation is further complicated by the fact that many of the homeowners have granted public access to an area stretching nearly eight metres inland of the high-tide mark, in exchange for receiving planning permission to develop their homes. </p> <p>The result is that the guards assume the public should be in the water, while the Coastal Commission says visitors can walk on any part of the wet sand, and even the dry sand where it has been ceded by the homeowner. The public, for its part, simply remains confused. </p> <p>\"The guards aren't so bad. They haven't bothered us that much,\" says Scott Kinloch, sitting with his family on dry sand two metres behind a sign warning him to keep off it. \"I guess they want their privacy but this is a beach. That's Robert Redford's house there,\" he adds, pointing to a house six metres behind him. Brent Ranck, who visits the beach regularly to fish while his sons go surfing, sympathises with the homeowners. \"At weekends it can get pretty crowded here, people up in the dunes, but the rest of the time it's like this - beautiful, clean.\" </p> <p>Marshall Grossman, a lawyer, Broad Beach resident and former coastal commissioner who is heading the efforts of the homeowners' association, says the guards perform a civic service. \"We believe that this patrol is essential to the health, safety and security of the residents, and we intend to keep it,\" he told the LA Times. He also voiced fears that, due to the absence of facilities at the beach, the public would knock on residents' doors asking to use their toilets. </p> <p>\"I get frequently hassled by the security guards,\" says Steve Hoye, who runs the pressure group Access for All. </p> <p>\"I was there in 1993 and this property owner came out with a martini in his hand and said, 'I don't mind if you use the beach but could you move 50 feet away so I can't see you from my picture window.' I told him where to go.\" </p> <p>For Mr Hoye, the celebrities are not the problem. \"I've been swimming in the sea alongside those guys - DeVito, Spielberg - and they're fine. They don't hassle anyone and no one hassles them. The problem really is a couple of heavy-duty fat blowhards who don't like people from central LA coming to their backyard.\" </p> <p>He adds: \"We're looking for a compromise. They're going to court and they're going to lose. It's a question of how much they want to spend to stall the process.\" </p> <p>Two years ago the DreamWorks boss David Geffen lost a court case he brought against the commission. It had attempted to make him comply with an earlier agreement to allow public access to the beach outside his Malibu mansion. He may have lost the case but the beach remains inaccessible. </p> <p>The commission has sent letters to eight Broad Beach homeowners instructing them to remove the signs and cease the patrols. \"At this point it involves a failure to obtain the necessary coastal permits,\" says Steve Hudson at the commission's local office. \"They have to cease what they are doing there or obtain a permit.\" </p> <p>But one line of defence for the homeowners' association is that it, and the signs, predate the 1972 coastal act. </p> <p>While that claim has still to be tested in court, the association has its place in the history of the struggle to protect the privacy afforded by wealth. The entire 27-mile Malibu coastline, was privately owned from the late 1880s until 1938 by Frederick and May Rindge, who employed armed guards on horseback to keep the public out. </p> <p>The Rindges allowed the celebrity hoi polloi on to their beaches when financial pressures forced them to rent land. Hollywood figures including Barbara Stanwyck, Gloria Swanson and Ronald Colman arrived. A decade later they were allowed to buy their properties. The first layer of Malibu's exclusivity had peeled away.</p>",
  "The United States is poised to extradite the two senior al-Qaida figures whose detention in Pakistan sparked terror alerts in London and New York, it emerged yesterday. <p>American intelligence agencies have coordinated closely with their counterparts in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, throughout the operations which led to the arrest of Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani and Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan. Both the national security agency (NSA), which provided sophisticated tracking devices, and the CIA helped to pinpoint their locations. </p> <p>\"The government is considering [handing] over Ghailani and Naeem [Khan] to the US authorities,\" an intelligence official in Islamabad said yesterday. No decision has yet been taken. </p> <p>There is a $25m bounty on the head of Mr Ghailani, who is wanted in connection with the lorry bomb attacks on US embassies in east Africa in 1998. US agents were present when he was taken to the provincial capital of Lahore. </p> <p>Several other leading al-Qaida commanders have been extradited to the US from Pakistan in the past two years, including Khalid Shaikh Muhammad, the alleged mastermind behind the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Centre. </p> <p>But any decision about handing over the latest suspects could be delayed. Pakistan's interior minister, Faisal Saleh Hayat, said yesterday: \"We can not extradite these terrorists until the completion of investigation by our security agencies, as they had plans to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan. </p> <p>\"We are committed to eliminate their network. The recent arrests are definitely going to create serious dents within the terrorist network.\" </p> <p>Mr Khan, a 25-year-old al-Qaida computer expert, was encouraged to take part in a sting operation against his former colleagues after his capture, it was confirmed yesterday. While he was in custody he emailed his contacts in the organisation. </p> <p>\"Initially he was trying to dodge the investigators, but after some time started cooperating,\" said a government official. \"He was asked to continue his job by sending email messages to trace the links and codes of al-Qaida operatives abroad and in Pakistan.\" </p> <p>Investigators believe that Mr Khan had been trying to hack into both the FBI's website and a British government site. </p> <p>His arrest helped to trigger the round-up of 12 al-Qaida suspects in Britain. One of those being questioned by police in London features in the US congressional report into the September 11 attacks, American sources said. </p> <p>The man, known as Abu Musa al-Hindi, who has been described as one of al-Qaida's most significant operatives, appears under the name Issa al-Britani in the 567-page document published last month. Both names are thought to be pseudonyms. </p> <p>In early 1999, the report says, Khalid Shaikh Muhammad \"sent al-Qaida operative Issa al-Britani to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to learn about the jihad in south-east Asia from Hambali [an Indonesian who is now in US custody, accused of being al-Qaida's leading figure in south-east Asia].\" </p> <p>It continues: \"Thereafter ... at Bin Laden's direction in early 2001, he sent Britani to the United States to case potential economic and 'Jewish' targets in New York city.\" </p> <p>The American embassy yesterday declined to comment on suggestions that the US might seek Hindi's extradition. </p> <p>David Blunkett, the home secretary, said yesterday that British authorities remained in a \"state of heightened readiness\" due to the ongoing terrorist threat to the UK. </p> <p>He insisted the government would issue a warning if it was the best way to protect people from a \"specific and credible threat\", but said it would not release details that might cause panic or jeopardise inquiries.\"There is a difference between alerting the public to a specific threat and alarming people unnecessarily.\" </p> <p>He stressed that the battle against international terrorism should not be viewed in any way as anti-Islamic. He said the vast majority of Muslims were peaceful and law-abiding and many UK Muslim leaders repeatedly condemned all forms of terrorism. </p> <p>UK security sources denied reports that they were looking for another five al-Qaida suspects who had evaded capture when police seized 12 alleged terrorists on Tuesday. \"We found those we were looking for,\" said a source.</p>",

  "Security forces in Saudi Arabia have arrested one of the kingdom's most wanted al-Qaida suspects, the official Saudi news agency said yesterday. <p>Faris al-Zahrani, a cleric who wrote for Voice of Jihad, a website linked to al-Qaida, was captured in the southern town of Abha on Thursday night. </p> <p>He was 12th on a list of the kingdom's 26 most-wanted suspects, issued by the Saudi authorities in December, but he recently moved up as others were killed or caught. </p> <p>As a result of a tip-off, police had been watching Mr Zahrani's movements since he arrived in Abha on Wednesday, the Jeddah-based Arab News said, citing a security source. </p> <p>He was carrying a hand grenade at the time of his arrest, but did not use it, the newspaper said. </p> <p>Mr Zahrani, 27, has a master's degree in Islamic law from the Imam Muhammad bin Saud Islamic University in Abha and is regarded as one of the militants' most prominent theorists, though the interior ministry describes him as \"one of the heads of strife\". </p> <p>For several weeks he had used the internet to taunt the authorities over the failure of their efforts to capture him. </p> <p>\"I would like to reassure the people who love me,\" he wrote on Voice of Jihad. </p> <p>\"I am careful in my movements and contacts, and I take all necessary precautions.\" </p> <p>When the authorities earlier this year announced a one-month amnesty for militants who gave themselves up, he said he had not even considered their offer. </p> <p>\"I never contemplated surrendering to any tyrant,\" he wrote in a message that was widely distributed on the internet. </p> <p>By the time the amnesty expired last month only a handful of militants had surrendered. One indication of Mr Zahrani's importance was the posting of support messages on the internet yesterday after news of his arrest. </p> <p>\"May God strengthen Faris al-Zahrani's heart. Make him calm and support him,\" one contributor wrote under the pen name Ishraqet Amal [dawn of hope]. </p> <p>\"As he championed righteousness and waged holy war for your sake, God, support him and don't let the infidels get to him [ie psychologically].\" </p> <p>Another contributor wrote: \"I pray to God that this news is false.\" </p> <p>Announcing the arrest yesterday, an official quoted by the Saudi news agency said: \"The interior ministry wishes to emphasise to all people that the security forces are determined to pursue the terrorists, get them out of their holes and apply God's law to them.\" </p> <p>The Saudi authorities launched a nationwide hunt for terror suspects and detained hundreds of people after a coordinated series of suicide bombings in May 2003 </p> <p>The kingdom suffered major attacks last November and in April and May this year, including the kidnapping and killing of westerners. </p> <p>After Mr Zahrani's arrest, only 11 of the 26 most wanted suspects are believed to remain at large, including Saleh Muhammad al-Aoofi, a former prison guard whom many regard as the leader of al-Qaida in Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>He is believed to have been promoted to the position after security forces killed Abdulaziz al-Moqrin, the mastermind of the kidnapping and beheading of an American engineer, Paul Johnson.</p>",
  "The parents of a British backpacker who went missing in Australia after getting into an argument at a concert have appealed for information as to his whereabouts. <p>Donal and Denise Kennedy, from Northampton, travelled to Sydney to aid the police inquiry into the disappearance of their son Sean, 22. </p> <p>He was last seen outside the Metro theatre in Sydney eight days ago after an argument with other concert-goers. </p> <p>New South Wales Police said they had \"grave concerns\" for the welfare of the former Liverpool University student. </p> <p>Mrs Kennedy told reporters at a press conference: \"Sean is the kind of son any parent would be proud of. He's considerate and very funny - he has a great sense of humour. </p> <p>\"He's a gentle giant who wouldn't want to hurt anyone, he's such a likeable person. </p> <p>\"Our lives have been turned upside down.

  "The Italian actor and cabaret performer Laura Betti, who has died aged 70, was the driving force behind the Pasolini Foundation, which she set up in Rome after the death of the poet and film director Pier Paolo Pasolini in 1975. The foundation has now found a home in Bologna, where both of them were born, and where Pasolini studied at university. <p>A barrister's daughter, Laura acted with several theatre companies, including that of Luchino Visconti, with his 1955 production of Arthur Miller's The Crucible. She was a singer in the late 1950s, and among her first important cinema cameos was a role in Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960), as one of the authentic Roman personalities/ freaks in the beach villa orgy sequence. Exchanging insults with Marcello Mastroianni's journalist, was a role she would enjoy playing always. </p> <p>In the early 1960s, Laura helped launch literary cabaret in Milan and Rome. In addition to her own droll songs, she performed sketches and lyrics by the likes of Alberto Moravia and Pasolini, whom she met in 1963. They hit it off immediately, and he became a regular guest at her home near the Spanish Steps. </p> <p>The first Pasolini film in which Laura appeared was La Ricotta, his controversial 40-minute episode in RoGoPaG (1963). Thanks chiefly to Laura's foundation, it is now available as a minor classic in its own right, whereas the episodes by Jean-Luc Godard and the others are forgotten. </p> <p>La Ricotta featured Orson Welles as an American director shooting a film about the passion of Christ in Rome. Laura was the temperamen tal star playing the Madonna, who was seen in the tableau vivant inspired by Pontormo's painting of the Deposition. Laura played herself - with a cross-section of Hollywood-on-the-Tiber caf\u00e9 society - in the press party sequence under the crosses, when the sub-proletarian Roman extra playing one of the thieves died from indigestion. </p> <p>Laura returned to the theatre in 1968, in a revival of Giordano Bruno's heretical Candlemaker, and then appeared, under Pasolini's direction in a Turin art gallery, in his verse drama Orgia. Even if his ideas on \"theatre that is not theatre\" were confused, the play was well in advance of its times. For the 10th anniversary of his death, Laura reprised the role of the woman in a tormented sado-masochistic relationship, and was more convincing under the direc tion of an experienced theatrical professional. </p> <p>She appeared in two more Pasolini episodes of omnibus films. In The Earth Seen From The Moon (1967), with Toto, Silvana Mangano and Ninetto Davoli, she played the cameo of a tourist; in What Are The Clouds? (1968), an inspired comic puppet play, she was Desdemona. </p> <p>In 1968, she had a more substantial Pasolini film role, as the maid in Theorem, for which she won the best actress award at the 1968 Venice festival. As the only peasant member of an otherwise bourgeois household, she alone finds redemption among those seduced by Terence Stamp's mysterious visitor, and at fade-out is seen flying from the rooftop while mother, father, son and daughter are left to rot. </p> <p>In 1970, Laura performed Samuel Beckett's Not I for the Rome Municipal Theatre. Having done the translation of the playlet into Italian for the director Franco Enriquez, I was asked to help her memorise the monologue. It was a gruelling but rewarding experience, though I had to give up trying to convince her that Beckett did not want a realistic rendering of the words he had put into the \"mouth\". In the end, she gave an electrifying performance, even if it was not what the author had intended. </p> <p>Her next Pasolini role was in his film The Canterbury Tales (1972), shot in England, in which she was the Wife of Bath. When Pasolini's chum Ninetto broke the director's heart by telling him he had decided to get married, Laura found herself obliged to play the role of a consolatory sister. </p> <p>In the early 1970s, she appeared in films by Marco Bellocchio, Mauro Bolognini, Miklos Jancso and the Taviani Brothers. She was also in Bernardo Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris (1972), 1900 (1976) and La Luna (1979). She continued to be Pasolini's hostess and cook, while jealous of his relationship with Maria Callas. </p> <p>Pasolini also convinced Laura to write a Rabelaisian novel about the sexual follies of 1960s swinging Rome, which she called, at his suggestion, Teta Veleta - only to find out later that the words were the name he had invented, at the age of three, to explain his first sexual fantasies, inspired by his mother's breasts and the knees of a boy his own age. </p> <p>After Pasolini's murder, Laura led the defence of his memory. She probably realised that the truth of what happened may indeed have been as the boy Pelosi described it, but she preferred the idea of a rightwing conspiracy, or anyway of an improvised queer-bashing attack. </p> <p>It has been suggested that Pasolini might have organised his own murder as a martyrdom, prompted by depression not only in his private life but also with the way Italian society was developing. But Laura refused to accept this: \"He loved life too much,\" she maintained. </p> <p>Indeed, she sacrificed her own career to protecting his memory, travelling throughout Italy, and around the world, for the cause. It is thanks to her aggressively passionate dedication that Pasolini's restored films and interviews have been made available for international viewing and his writings archived. In 2001, she made a 90-minute documentary, Pier Paolo Pasolini: The Reason For A Dream, emphasising what she considered to be his optimistic vision of the future. When health permitted, she continued to appear in films and on the stage. </p> <p>In 1971, Pasolini wrote an affectionate obituary notice about her in Italian Vogue - imagining her death in 2001. It ended: \"This is, in fact, the obituary notice of a heroine. It should be added that she was a witty person and an excellent cook.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Laura Betti (Laura Trombetti), actor, born May 1 1934; died July 31 2004</p>",
  "<b>Sex changes on the up in Iran</b> <br> <p>The <b>New York Times</b> (August 2) brought the remarkable news from Iran of a growing acceptance of sex-change surgery. \"After decades of repression, Iran's Islamic government is recognising people with sexual-identity disorders and allowing them to have sex-change operations and obtain new birth certificates,\" reported Nazila Fathi. </p> <p>After the 1979 Islamic revolution, the religious government \"classed transsexuals and transvestites with gays and lesbians, who were condemned by Islam and faced the punishment of lashing under Iran's penal code\". But today, the Muslim clerics who control the judiciary are more understanding. </p> <p>Obstacles remain, however: surgical procedures are expensive, the protracted application process demands medical proof of gender-identity disorder; and socially, it is far from being broadly accepted. \"In a society where men enjoy a higher status than women, the stigma against any man who wants to be a woman is especially strong,\" noted Fathi. \"'They compliment a girl who behaves and dresses like a man as a strong person, but they look down at us and despise us,' said Assal, who was disowned by her father for having surgery to become a woman.\" </p> <p><b>Bentley, Rolls and the bling</b><br> </p> <p>Black artists are dominating the US charts as never before, observed Andy Wilman in <b>Top Gear</b> magazine (September). Their choice of vehicle, however, is very British, and very traditional. Beyonc\u00e9, Nelly, P Diddy, Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Ludacris, Mary J Blige, Dr Dre, Missy Elliot and Busta Rhymes are just some of the musicians that have a Bentley and/or a Rolls-Royce in their garage. \"The head-on train crash between ghetto fabulous and the pedlars of walnut and Wilton over in England has resulted in stratospheric kudos for two of the world's stuffiest brands,\" said Wilman, as \"the patronage of hip-hop is pretty much a dream endorsement.\" Indeed, \"Jay-Z can hardly write a verse without the word Bentley cropping up.\" </p> <p>But where does the appetite for these cars come from? Dawton Thomas, editor of Rides magazine, pointed to the influences of Sean Combs (aka Puff Daddy, aka P Diddy). It was partly \"the whole Rat Pack influence\", but their choice of car was to reflect a business approach: \"Puff and Jay-Z, with the Bentley and Rolls, are showing they don't have the mentality of young men, but the mentality of businessmen. They own the record company, they have the clothing lines ... A Bentley says you're in control.\" </p> <p><b>Hear the one about Jesus?</b><br> </p> <p>The <b>New Yorker</b> (August 9-16) introduced its readers to Brad Stine, \"stand-up for the Lord\". This 44-year-old Evangelical Christian comedian began his career as a comic, sword-swallower and \"nose flosser\" in mainstream venues, where he struggled to make waves or money. But he found his true calling - after prayer - and traded the club for the chapel. \"Last year turned out to be one of Stine's busiest ever,\" wrote Adam Green. \"He played dozens of church dates, at $5,000 [\u00a32,750] a show ... He recorded his first DVD ... He went on an 18-city tour.\" He also won TV spots and he could be on stage at the Republican party convention later this month. </p> <p>What is the show like? \"His style is frantic, aggressive and caustic ... Stine's act is built around his rants, which often have the flavour of sermons. He rails against atheists, liberals, Darwinists, pro-choicers, animal-rights activists, moral relativists ... with a vitriol that seems to tap into his audience's own resentments ... His frequent use of the word 'stinking' make you realise how often he would say 'fucking' if he didn't work clean.\" </p> <p>Most of his jokes are directed at \"liberals and unbelievers, but Christians took flak, too. He did an impression of a Protestant whining, 'Satan made me lose my job' ('No - your incompetence made you lose your job!') and made fun of churches that organise Harry Potter book burnings ('Here's a good rule of thumb: If Hitler tried it - maybe go the other way.')\"</p>",
  "<p>Solicitors representing the woman at the centre of the FA sex scandal warned newspapers today that papers related to Faria Alam had gone missing and they would seek to injunct any paper that threatened to reveal the confidential information.</p> <p>But within an hour the solicitors admitted that the papers had been recovered and they had just taken an \"extra precautionary measure\" by issuing a warning to newspapers.</p> <p>\"The papers have been safely retrieved, there is no story,\" said her solicitor, Steven Barker, of criminal law firm Barker Gillette.</p> <p>Ms Alam yesterday resigned from the Football Association and has sold her story to two Sunday newspapers - the News of the World and the Mail on Sunday - in a deal worth around \u00a3400,000. She has agreed to tell her story on TV with a \u00a3100,000 deal with ITV's Tonight with Trevor McDonald.</p> <p>The warning initially fuelled immediate speculation that the law firm had been burgled or been the victim of a late night raid along the lines of those once conducted by Benjamin Pell - known as Benji the Binman - who plied a trade by retrieving highly confidential information from bin bags from high-profile law and accountancy firms and selling it on to newspapers.</p> <p>The legal warning issued this afternoon said that the papers had been stolen from the firm and the theft reported to the police.</p> <p>It said Ms Alam's solicitors would seek injunctive relief to prevent the publication of the whole or part of any of these documents should any newspaper seek to use the content of the documents.</p> <p>Mr Barker is a high-powered partner in a firm specialising in serious and business fraud, excise duty and VAT evasion.

  "The home secretary, David Blunkett, moved to reassure the British public today after unconfirmed reports that five al-Qaida militants were on the run in the UK. <p>Mr Blunkett said the country was \"maintaining a state of heightened readiness\", although he made no specific comment on reports that members of a \"terror cell\" escaped capture during police raids earlier this week</p> <p>He also defended the government's tactics on publicising the terror threat. Ministers had struck the right balance between keeping the public informed while causing no unnecessary alarm, he insisted. </p> <p>\"We are maintaining a state of heightened readiness and taking every feasible precautionary measure to protect British citizens, both here and abroad, consistent with the level of threat,\" Mr Blunkett said. </p> <p>\"Advice would be issued immediately if the public needed to take specific action which could make them safer,\" he added. </p> <p>\"There is also a difference between alerting the public to a specific threat and alarming people unnecessarily by passing on information indiscriminately. I think we have got the balance right.\" </p> <p>Regarding this week's arrests, Mr Blunkett said: \"I am being kept fully informed of police operations. As these are ongoing I cannot comment further on them at this stage. </p> <p>\"What matters is that the relevant authorities are vigorously pursuing their investigations in order to protect the public.\" </p> <p>In response to Tory calls for the government to be more open about the current situation, he said some sensitive details could jeopardise investigations and possibly prejudice trials if they were revealed. </p> <p>Moving to reassure the Muslim community about this week's arrests, Mr Blunkett said: \"We do not see the Muslim community as a threat. The vast majority of Muslim people are peaceful and law-abiding. </p> <p>\"The powers within the Terrorism Act are aimed at preventing terrorism, whatever its source. They are not aimed at a particular race, religion, or any other group.\" </p> <p>The five men reported to have evaded capture on Tuesday, all of Pakistani origin, were linked to an alleged terrorist plot to attack Heathrow airport, according to the Times newspaper. The home office has denied there is any new plot to target the airport.</p> <p>They were said to be under the command of an alleged senior British al-Qaida agent, who was reportedly among the 12 men arrested by police during the raids in London and three counties. </p> <p>Police have been granted an extension to custody time limits, which allows them to hold the men, aged between 19 and 32, until Sunday evening. </p> <p>Abu Eisa al-Hindi was said to have been involved in the Heathrow plot, details of which were discovered on the computer of an al-Qaida suspect recently arrested in Pakistan. </p> <p>It was also reported today that al-Hindi directed the surveillance of landmark buildings in the US that are now on heightened terror alert. He may even have travelled to sites to gather the information, unnamed senior US officials told the New York Times. </p> <p>A court also heard today that a British man facing extradition to the United States on terrorism charges was found in possession of strategic plans for a US navy battle group in the Gulf. </p> <p>Babar Ahmad, 30, of south London, also had email links to one of the men suspected of planning the Moscow theatre bombing, and operated a series of pro-Jihad websites, it was alleged. </p> <p>Ahmad, arrested yesterday on a warrant issued on behalf of US authorities, appeared before Bow Street magistrates court in London and was remanded in custody.</p>",
  "<p>When DJ Sean Rowley was looking for a way of breaking up the \"cutting-edge music\" format of his Radio London show, the Joy of Music, he began throwing in records from his childhood. Not the Rolling Stones or the Beatles, but long-forgotten 1970s relics such as Captain and Tennille or Sherbert's Howzat, which addresses infidelity using cricket metaphors, and the Starland Vocal Band's softly rocking Afternoon Delight, which innocently eulogises intercourse with the words \"Sky rockets in flight\". </p> <p>Rowley expected complaints, not because of the unusual metaphors but because these are not the sort of records you would ever find on 100 greatest - or even 1,000 greatest - singles lists. Nor are they ever played on the radio or reissued on CD. But instead, people called the show in droves. And when Rowley asked listeners to suggest similar records that they liked \"in spite of themselves\", he got the biggest response in the station's history. </p> <p>Rowley has now compiled an album, Guilty Pleasures, featuring these lost gems. His definition of a Guilty Pleasure goes like this: \"You've gone round to someone's house, and you're flicking through their record collection. There are all the usual suspects: the Clash, Marvin Gaye, Revolver, Astral Weeks ... </p> <p>\"And then you see a Barbra Streisand album. And you go, 'Hang on, what are you doing with this?' At which point the owner of the record places it on the deck and says, 'Have you listened to this recently?' And you're dumbfounded as to how great that record is.\" </p> <p>And this is the point. Guilty Pleasures are not bad records. Some are amazing records. But they are uncool records, made by people with moustaches, demi-waves, terrifying trousers and - in some cases - kipper ties. These are pop's lepers, rarely meriting a mention in rock histories. It's no coincidence that almost all of Rowley's choices date from 1975-77. These are the tunes that punk effectively swept away. </p> <p>When punk hit, people suddenly stopped buying the stirring, romantic melodies of people like Lancastrian Peter Skellern, who recorded with the Grimethorpe colliery band and had hair like Arthur Scargill. Or Pilot, who were very big in 1974-76 but disappeared soon afterwards. </p> <p>\"We wrote nice, charming songs,\" sniggers Pilot's David Paton, from his Spanish hideaway. \"And then along came God Save the Queen.\" Of course, people such as Queen and the Rolling Stones, who were \"drinking champagne with royalty\", were punk's real enemies. Nevertheless, 1977 put anyone resembling the old guard into the firing line. </p> <p>High-voiced brotherly duo Alessi were flying high in the charts with the jazzy Oh Lori when they encountered the Sex Pistols at Capital Radio. \"God Save the Queen was number two and we were three,\" remembers Bobby Alessi, his 1970s-style locks defiantly glistening. \"We were wearing little white cap-sleeved T-shirts. They looked like they'd just been to battle. We went up to say, 'Guys, we'd like to congratulate you on your success.' Sid Vicious took one look and said, 'Fuck off!'\" </p> <p>In some cases, the vitriol was deserved. Actor Brian Protheroe, a one-hit wonder with Pinball, remembers appearing on one mid-70s Top of the Pops amid some \"terrible, abject stuff\". Stuff like Love Me, Love My Dog, by Peter Shelley, who \"bounced around the studio to a film of a golden retriever\". </p> <p>Overnight, careers were ruined. Andrew Gold had two massive, brooding hits and was set to be the Chris Martin of his day. A few months after reading an interview in which one of the Clash said, \"I really want to punch Andrew Gold in the face,\" he was being asked whether he was still in the music business. When Alessi toured the UK in 1979, fans congratulated them for \"surviving\". </p> <p>Punk didn't topple the Stones, but in its attempt to create a Year Zero, as Rowley explains, \"punk destroyed the innocence. Mostly, these were very, very innocent records; you were gonna have a problem if you were wearing these records as your badges.\" </p> <p>Some of the banished artists went on to further success, but were forced to take their songwriting talents and moustaches behind the scenes to work with the likes of Paul McCartney and Elton John. Alessi do advertisements, and are even thinking of a new album. But what's more curious is that punks such as the Damned's Dave Vanian and Captain Sensible now confess to rather liking these records. </p> <p>\"I've always loved Gallagher and Lyle,\" chuckles Mark Perry, founder of punk Bible Sniffin' Glue, \"and that Ace song, How Long. I'd never have said that at the time!\" </p> <p>When Rowley began exhuming Guilty Pleasures, he was surprised at how many other \"cool\" pop people hid Guilty pasts. Terry Hall, who arrived at Radio London with bags full of the blighters, confessed to having spent his Specials' career amassing pre-punk singles from motorway service stations and battling with Jerry Dammers to play them on the tour bus (the band split in 1981 citing \"extreme musical differences\"). When Rowley played the Guilty Pleasures promo backstage at Glastonbury, Norman Cook leaped in the air. </p> <p>\"He could not believe that he was hearing these records,\" says the DJ, \"and, like everyone else, he knew every single word.\" </p> <p>For anyone over 30, these songs are like hidden time bombs, drilled into the consciousness in the days when a single's shelf life wasn't weeks but months. Rowley admits to nostalgia: \"When I hear Starland Vocal Band I'm back on a beach with my mum and dad. The sun is shining, the Radio 1 Roadshow is playing in the background.\" </p> <p>And yet these records have enduring appeal. Apart from echoes from groups such as the Scissor Sisters, Perry laments the loss of \"a naive but crafted pop sensibility that actually wasn't that different from punk\". Rowley misses the doe-eyed charm of things like Ace's How Long, which isn't about an affair but a rival band's attempts to steal their bassist. \"If you look at the clip from Top of the Pops, you can actually see the singer eyeballing the bass player, mouthing, 'How long has this been going on?'\" he chortles. </p> <p>Most of these records have a storytelling aspect that only the Streets and Eminem successfully tackle today. Carole Bayer Seger's 1977 You're Moving Out (which Perry admits to picking up in Oxfam years later for 10p) relates chucking out a lover with his \"rubber ducks and dirty looks\". Weirdest of all is Helen Reddy's Angie Baby, a tale of a murderous woman who keeps a dead \"lover\" in her flat. It is just as disturbing as Eminem's Stan. </p> <p>Which brings up the question of whether there are uncool records today that in years to come will be unearthed as Guilty Pleasures. Rowley thinks there are. \"I bought a copy of Ronan Keating's Rollercoaster recently, and I swear it was like buying porn,\" he says. \"I sandwiched it between Big Star's Greatest Hits and the latest Joyzipper album.\" </p> <p>Today's kids don't have it as hard as those who queued up to buy records by 40-year-olds in tank tops. Bands are styled - taught names to drop and things to say. However, no number of makeovers can disguise the fundamental awkwardness of Starsailor, or the fact that the over-13s must play those Rachel Stevens singles behind closed doors. </p> <p>So really, lifestyle decisions haven't changed from the days when a 12-year-old Rowley stood with his pocket money in Woolworths considering \"Bowie, Roxy, the Faces ... all these amazing, credible bands.\" </p> <p>Instead, he bought Could It Be Forever by David Cassidy. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Guilty Pleasures is released by Sony on August 23.</p>",
  "<p>Voters could be given a unique pin number to combat electoral fraud if postal ballots replace voting at traditional polling booths, an influential committee of MPs recommended today.</p> <p>It is one of the measures the government will now consider as it reviews the future of all-postal voting in the wake of June's pilots in the European and local elections, and a forthcoming report from the independent Electoral Commission.</p> <p>Today's recommendations, from the select committee shadowing the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister - which has responsibility for organising elections - are part of an ongoing debate about the merits of the system, which saw turnouts rise but was also subject to numerous allegations of electoral fraud and technical glitches.</p> <p>The committee recommends ending the practice of registering entire households on the electoral roll, and instead suggests giving individual voters a unique pin number.</p> <p>The number would have to be entered onto a postal ballot paper by the voter and returned with a signature.</p> <p>Responding to the select committee, the local government minister, Nick Raynsford, said he would consult in the autumn on plans to switch to an individual voter registration system.</p> <p>Mr Raynsford said he welcomed the report's endorsement of all-postal voting, but cautioned against the problems encountered since its publication following the June elections. </p> <p>The government also refused to rule out further pilots of postal ballots in elections before deciding whether to return to the traditional polling booth. </p> <p>Mr Raynsford warned: \"It is worth noting that further pilots would assist us in understanding better the effect of repeated all-postal elections is [having] on voting behaviour and whether the increases in voter turnout are sustained.</p> <p>\"Before making a decision on the mainstream use of all-postal voting for local elections, as recommended by the Electoral Commission, we will also need to engage in a public consultation to gather wider views on what would be an important change to our democratic system.\" </p> <p>The government response also conceded that changing the voting system \"can never be a panacea for declining voter turnout\". </p> <p>It added: \"Elections have to be engaged by the issues debated at election time, and between elections, if they are to decide they want to cast their vote at all.\" </p> <p>The Electoral Commission also welcomed the report, which backed a number of its own recommendations to the government. </p> <p>These include new measures to prevent fraud and rigorous monitoring of the Royal Mail's performance in delivering papers. </p> <p>The government has declared itself so concerned by the problems encountered in some of the regional pilots that postponed two of the three all-postal referendums on regional assemblies, which were scheduled to take place this November. </p> <p>It announced its decision to put on hold the referendums for Yorkshire and the Humber and the north-west due to concerns that the trials had been flawed in these regions.</p> <p>The debate has taken a convoluted path, with the select committee first evaluating voting systems in May, ahead of the local and European elections. The government and the Electoral Commission then gave their feedback to that report, and today's second report from the committee is a response to those views. </p> <p>A further report from the Electoral Commission due later this month.</p> <p> Caroline Spelman, for the Conservatives, welcomed the proposals but said no further all-postal votes should go ahead until they were in place. </p> <p>\"We welcome that the government is looking to move ahead with individual electoral registration - as shown in Northern Ireland, it would significantly reduce the scope for electoral fraud. </p> <p>\"Yet, given such legislation cannot be introduced in time for the regional assembly referendum in November, the government should cancel the use of all-postal voting and restore the tried and trusted ballot box.\" </p> <p>John Elliott, the chairman of anti-regional assembly campaign North East Says No, said the region should not have to use a system which still had problems. </p> <p>\"We welcome any measure that increases turnout and participation,\" he said. \"However, there must be full confidence in the voting system. </p> <p>\"With the problems experienced in the local and European elections, it seems impossible to share the government's confidence in all postal voting. </p> <p>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister later made it clear that the consultation would be on the whole issue of all-postal ballots - including possible moves to individual voter registration. </p> <p>But a spokeswoman said that the idea of issuing pin numbers was a recommendation of the committee and not something being actively considered by ministers at this time.</p>",
  "<p>LAW OF THE JUNGLE</p> <p>Milan Mandaric should know a thing or two about the law of the jungle. At the age of 26 he was running the biggest business in Yugoslavia - handling mass-produced car spares - when he was branded a \"capitalist\" by the communist authorities and nearly flung behind bars. Now the Fiver doesn't like to call people names, but the Portsmouth chairman's complaint today that Arsenal were jeopardising his attempts to sign Michael Carrick was the rankest piece of hypocrisy since Great Uncle Philanderer Fiver accused George Best of having an eye for the ladies. Especially when Pompey then went and stole Aliou Cisse from under Palace's nose.</p> <p>\"I am unhappy with the situation. We have worked hard,\" moaned free-marketeer-when-it-suits-him Mandaric, as Arsene Wenger confirmed his interest. \"[Carrick] has always been a player that I loved,\" he cooed. \"If we sign him, it could happen even if Patrick [Vieira] stays - but nothing has been done on that front.\" And it might not, with Real Madrid saying that talks have broken down. So what does Mandaric make of it all? \"We are still expecting Michael to come down,\" he said, doing his best Leslie Crowther impression. \"We expect West Ham to honour the agreement we have with them.\" </p> <p>Stirring stuff. And almost believable. But not quite! Because not long after putting away his violin, Mandaric emerged with a machine-gun to blow away Crystal Palace's hopes of signing Aliou Cisse on loan from Birmingham. Yesterday Palace had looked all set to bring the man who captained Senegal in the 2002 World Cup to Selhurst Park, only for Mandaric to rediscover his capitalist bent in the nick of time and poach Cisse for \u00a3300,000. Except this time he let Portsmouth chief executive Peter Storrie do the talking. \"Aliou is a tenacious ball-winning player with a very competitive spirit. He is a winner and has been sought after by a few Premier League clubs.\" Mandaric was too busy tinkering with his ethics to comment.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>FREE SPORTS SPECIALS WITH THE GUARDIAN!</strong></p> <p>Get your 84-page guide to the Olympics tomorrow and The Season, your 84-page guide to the whole football year, this Monday.

  "This time last week, John Kerry was pictured in a salute on the front of US newspapers, telling the nation that he was \"reporting for duty\". <p>Today, his political opponents are hoping to take the shine off his military record with allegations that he won his five medals by lies and subterfuge.</p> <p>An advertisement broadcast last night in the swing states of Wisconsin, Ohio and West Virginia - where a few votes could make all the difference - featured veterans such as Larry Thurlow telling voters: \"When the chips were down, you could not count on John Kerry.\" </p> <p>Mr Thurlow was in Vietnam at the same time as the presidential candidate, but he was not one of the men who had served on his Mekong delta swiftboat. Mr Kerry describes them as his \"band of brothers\", and they portray him as a courageous fighter and hero.</p> <p>Mr Kerry's supporters, who have made much of his service in contrast to that of George Bush - who was excused Vietnam duty to serve in the Texas National Air Guard - are alleging dirty tricks.</p> <p>The advert is part of a coordinated campaign. A week on Sunday, a book called Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry, will be published, co-authored by former swiftboat commander John O'Neill.</p> <p>It alleges that the wounds Mr Kerry won his three purple heart medals for were not worthy of the awards and, in at least two cases, had been self-inflicted in order to get him off the battlefield. </p> <p>It argues that for him to run for president with such a record while faulting his opponent's would \"represent unbelievable hypocrisy and the truly bottom rung of human conduct\".</p> <p>The Republican senator John McCain, a Vietnam veteran, spoke out after the advert's screening to \"deplore\" the tactics. When he ran against Mr Bush for the Republican nomination in 2000, he had to fight off allegations that being a captive (he was held in solitary confinement for three years) was not as heroic as actively attacking the enemy. Yesterday, he called on the White House to condemn the \"dishonest and dishonourable\" commercial.</p> <p>Mr Bush's spokesman, Scott McCellan, did not denounce the advert but the money that paid for it - so-called \"soft money\", which is collected by independent political funds known as 527s. These are not counted as the Bush or Kerry campaigns so long as they do not actively call on voters to elect either man. Criticising a candidate's record is, however, fair game.</p> <p>Therefore, neither of the parties behind the advert are part of the Republican party or the Bush campaign. Swift Boat Veterans for Truth is a 527, and Regnery Press is a commercial (although politically committed) publishing company. However, a look at the people who connect the enterprises reveals them to be part of a rich partisan tapestry.</p> <p>Mr O'Neill is the link between them. As well as being the book's co-author, he is a member of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth steering committee. The group was set up with the help of Merrie Spaeth, the widow of Tex Lezar, who was Republican candidate for lieutenant governor of Texas in the same year that Mr Bush ran for governor. He was a partner of Mr O'Neill's at their Houston law firm.</p> <p>Regnery, meanwhile, proclaims itself to be the leading conservative publisher in the US. Acquired by Republican donor Thomas Philips in 1993, it is a subsidiary of Eagle Publishing, which is using its flagship Human Events magazine to promote Unfit for Command and build up its subscription base and mailing lists. </p> <p>Regnery publishes on any number of topics (from threats to marriage to a defence of assault rifles), but scored a number of hits in the Clinton years with titles such as the conservative columnist Ann Coulter's High Crimes and Misdemeanors: the case against Bill Clinton.</p> <p>The most notorious - Gary Aldrich's Unlimited Access: an FBI agent inside the Clinton White House - depicted the executive mansion as a den of debauchery, drug-taking and gay sex. One section claimed the president was smuggled out under a rug for trysts with a female celebrity in a nearby hotel. Mr Aldrich admitted in the book that many of his allegations were, at best, second-hand.</p> <p>On top of this, the O'Neill/Regnery axis has links going back to Richard Nixon. Also a swift boat commander in Vietnam, Mr O'Neill was hired by presidential aide Charles Colson in 1971 to discredit the recently returned Mr Kerry's campaign against the war. Mr Kerry reputedly beat him in a nationally televised debate on the Dick Cavett Show.</p> <p>Sidney Blumenthal, a Guardian columnist and former adviser to Mr Clinton, said he saw nothing new in Mr O'Neill's book and the campaign mounted by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. \"It reeks of partisan dirty tricks, and the facts simply don't hold up at all. The intent is simply to dirty Kerry,\" he said. \"They have been trying to do this for a long time. Regardless of whether it is false, they will put it out to see if it will hurt.\"</p> <p>The truth of the allegations is disputed by the Kerry campaign, and contradicts the most authoritative account of his time in Vietnam, Douglas Brinkley's Tour of Duty. The author is director of the Eisenhower Centre for American Studies at New Orleans university, which specialises in military history.</p> <p>But the truth does not matter - to confuse the issue of Mr Kerry's military service, which he has made such a strong part of his campaign, is enough to occupy the candidate, distract him and muddy his record.</p> <p>It is not the first time dirty tricks have surfaced in the 2004 campaign. The Drudge Report (which has served as a conduit for the allegations over Mr Kerry's Vietnam service, including allegations that he slaughtered livestock and burned down a village with a Zippo lighter) ran reports in February that the Massachusetts senator had an affair with an intern. There was no truth in it.</p> <p>Later, a photograph emerged of Mr Kerry at a rally with Jane Fonda, the actress who visited Hanoi during the war and, to some, will forever be known as Hanoi Jane. It was proven to be a fake.</p> <p>\"In all this campaign, attacking Kerry on his Vietnam heroism has always backfired,\" Mr Blumenthal commented. </p> <p>\"It is particularly ironic and dangerous, given the fact that Bush is withholding national service records that that show he did not show up for duty in the Alabama national guard, and that he has still not come clean about why he was suspended from flying in the Texas air national guard after refusing to take a physical.\"</p> <p>Of course, Democrats are not the only victims of dirty tricks. The emergence of documents detailing Mr Bush's arrest for drink-driving a few days before the last presidential election was blamed in some quarters for the closeness of the result and his failure to win the popular vote.</p> <p>Around the time of the Kerry intern allegations, the Republican national committee chairman, Ed Gillespie, expressed outrage that the musician Moby, a Kerry supporter, had told the New York Daily News it would be possible to spread anti-Bush gossip on the internet to bring down his support among, for example, anti-abortionists.</p> <p>He then turned it into a pre-emptive rebuttal, opening up the interesting question of whether allegations of dirty tricks constituted a form of dirty campaigning.</p> <p>\"We know now that, some time this fall, Kerry campaign operatives intend to go into pro-life chatrooms on the internet to spread a scurrilous story that President Bush drove a former girlfriend to an abortion clinic and paid for her abortion,\" Mr Gillespie told the Washington Times.</p> <p>Dirty campaigning is nothing new in US politics: in 1800, Thomas Jefferson was accused of favouring the teaching of \"murder, robbery, rape, adultery and incest\". </p> <p>One of Mr Nixon's operatives, Donald Segretti, was imprisoned for illegal campaign material, including faked letters alleging that a senator had fathered an illegitimate child with a 17-year-old. </p> <p>The 2004 race for the White House is close, and we should not be surprised to see more dirty campaigning between now and November.</p>",
  "<p>A leading private hospital, the London Clinic, receives an estimated \u00a34m in tax breaks because it is a registered charity but spends less than a tenth of that sum on charitable activity, research has uncovered.</p> <p>The figures are revealed in a forthcoming report produced by a research and training charity, the Directory of Social Change (DSC), which examines the charitable status of major independent hospitals. The study looked in detail at the London Clinic and the Nuffield Hospitals Group, the country's third largest independent healthcare company.</p> <p>More than a third of Britain's private healthcare sector is made up of charities, which receive millions of pounds in tax breaks each year. </p> <p>But their status is under threat from new charities legislation, now being scrutinised by a parliamentary committee, which ministers have promised will force charities that charge high fees to prove they offer a \"public benefit\".</p> <p>The charities minister, Fiona Mactaggart, has pledged that the public benefit test will apply to private schools and hospitals with charitable status. </p> <p>Although she expected many schools to pass the test, she has warned that the future charitable status of private healthcare providers such as Nuffield and the London Clinic were \"the biggest question\".</p> <p>The 199-bed London Clinic, the second-largest hospital in the UK in financial terms, has a turnover of more than \u00a360m. In 2002-03, it retained a \u00a36.9m surplus - substantially higher than the estimated tax concession. </p> <p>The DSC report estimates that the hospital gains more than \u00a34m a year in tax concessions because of its charitable status, but its annual report showed that just \u00a3354,000 - 9% of the tax break - was set aside in \"charitable discounts\".</p> <p>The clinic charges a daily room rate of between \u00a3450 and \u00a31,200, \"at the most expensive range of care available\" in Greater London, the DSC research noted. But it is not clear from the clinic's annual report whether or not the \"charitable discounts\" are used to subsidise treatment for those who cannot afford the commercial prices.</p> <p>Although the recipients of the \"charitable discount\" for 2002-03 were not detailed, the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow Fund received 67% of the money in 2000, and 38% in 1999. The DSC report concludes: \"The amount given in free or discounted care is therefore likely to be slight.\"</p> <p>The clinic used to run a free-treatment Diamond Jubilee Fund for a limited number of patients each year, but this closed in 2003. The DSC report says: \"Even if this fund had continued ... the sums given for free treatment of patients seem relatively insignificant and unlikely to have met a sufficient level of public benefit\" to pass the proposed public benefit test.</p> <p>The report adds: \"There is little or no reference in their annual report to promoting their work to a wider section of the public.\"</p> <p>DSC also examined Nuffield Hospitals Group, which last year had a \u00a3410m turnover. It notes that the group is attempting to cut charges to \"affordable levels\" - around \u00a3290 to \u00a3349 a day, broadly in line with private sector competitors BMI Healthcare and Bupa. </p> <p>But, the report said, considering the tax breaks secured by Nuffield \"it is surprising to see that these advantages are not reflected more in prices or in additional charitable services offered\".</p> <p>Report author Emma Jepson, a DSC researcher, said the hospitals were \"not really making provision for charitable care or public benefit\". They were meeting the charitable purpose of \"relief of the sick\" under Britain's 400-year-old charity law, she said. \"But when the new law comes in, they are not meeting provision of public benefit.\"</p> <p>The Nuffield Hospitals chief executive, David Mobbs, said the organisation was not for profit, had no shareholders and reinvested its surpluses in its hospitals and providing patient care. </p> <p>\"Nuffield Hospitals delivers its charitable services through the provision of acute healthcare services, not only for those who have the ability to pay themselves but also through private medical insurers and by assisting the NHS in reducing waiting lists,\" he said.</p> <p>No one from the London Clinic was available for comment.</p>",
  "It might be that one of the worst blows ever delivered to our fragile system of international law and order happened a few months ago when, on June 2, five members of a M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) team were murdered in northern Afghanistan. <p>The Taliban has claimed responsibility for those deaths. Yet, given the media's fascination with all that happens in Iraq and its focus on the US presidential elections, this event received far too little attention, as does the steady collapse of law and order in Afghanistan itself.</p> <p>These assassinations, and the subsequent withdrawal of MSF from Afghanistan, could have a far-reaching effect.</p> <p>To understand why, it is necessary to understand MSF's importance in world affairs. This extraordinary organization was founded by a group of French doctors in 1971 to provide emergency medical assistance during wartime and in crisis areas. </p> <p>Currently, it has around 2,500 volunteers (including doctors, nurses and technical support), joined by roughly 15,000 local staff across the globe. MSF, active in 80 countries, goes into places where angels fear to tread. </p> <p>Being one of the first non-governmental organisations to go into troubled zones - such as western Sudan - MSF draws international attention to burgeoning crises. It will also go into countries after the fighting is over to pick up the pieces, so to speak. </p> <p>MSF is usually welcomed by all sides in a dispute or a famine because its intentions are so transparent - to bring medical services, food supplies and sanitation. Its charter proudly states that its volunteers \"are aware of the risk and dangers of the mission they undertake, and have no right to compensation for themselves or their beneficiaries other than what M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res is able to afford them.\" </p> <p>While MSF strives to avoid taking sides, it is not bound to political neutrality in word and deed, like the international committee of the Red Cross. For example, in 1999 - the same year that MSF was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize - the group's chairman openly appealed to the then Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, to stop the bombing of civilians in Chechnya. </p> <p>Before announcing its decision - after much agonising - to withdraw its 80 foreign volunteers from Afghanistan and dismiss its 1,400 local staff, MSF had worked in the country for 24 years. The group had become famous decades earlier by bringing medicine to stricken Afghan communities by packhorse and mules.</p> <p>It is hard to read about this withdrawal without shedding a tear. And, as I write this piece, the word comes in that MSF is scaling down its work in neighboring Pakistan because of worries over imitation attacks. </p> <p>So two poor and populous countries in great need of the MSF's unselfish work are now made to suffer from calculated extremist attacks. And other relief organizations are also considering pulling out of Afghanistan. Overall, 30 relief workers were killed in the country during the first six months of this year. Why can't this be headline news?</p> <p>That, alas, is not the worst of it. The MSF deaths, and the organisation's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, point to two big questions about international peace and security in the 21st century. </p> <p>The first is whether any international relief group (devoted to human rights, women's issues, the environment, childcare) that has its headquarters in New York, Paris, Geneva or Vienna can avoid the suspicion that it is just another form of western intrusion in a troubled land - and thus be denounced and attacked by malcontents. </p> <p>Are not German religious and relief workers in distraught Kosovo part of a NATO plot? Is not the news that Tony Blair has asked the British chiefs of staff to prepare plans to send a military contingent to Darfur to stop the dreadful genocide just another demonstration of the west's continuing imperialistic ambitions? </p> <p>To many of us, these seem totally absurd suspicions. Yet, when one learns of MSF's complaints that the US military had badly mixed its role in Afghanistan with those of the civilian aid groups - by distributing relief to communities that would offer intelligence and also by sometimes wearing civilian clothes - one cannot be completely surprised at the local response, even if it was carried out by extremists. </p> <p>This leads to the most disturbing question of all: can the UN, the great and small powers that are central members of it, and the agencies that report to and support it, maintain the current assumption that a distinction can be made between its \"hard\" work (peace enforcement, chapter seven operations, eliminating rogue states) and its \"soft\" work (rebuilding economies and helping the distressed, wounded, displaced and other victims of conflict and disaster)? </p> <p>In most past peacekeeping operations, that was a reasonable assumption. Local antagonists would be very willing, as in Mogadishu in 1993, to damage the UN's (or the delegated US's) armed forces. But neutral, philanthropic and church-based organisations on the ground were rarely assaulted. That is no longer the case. </p> <p>Why? The answer is perfectly plain. For some years now, scholars in what is called the \"security community\" (ie those who think about war and peace) have been discussing the problem of asymmetrical warfare.</p> <p>The logic chain goes like this: The US is in such a dominant position in terms of traditional military power (right now, it may well be spending one-half of the world's total defence expenditure) that its various foes are not going to attack it in a battle of Midway manner, big fleet against big fleet. </p> <p>No, they will attack the US in a sneaky, underhand way, as in 9/11. They will attack the nation's weak points, not its strengths. This is why there are large cement blocks outside the New York Stock Exchange and checks on trucks going up and down the coasts, and why people take off their shoes at airports. </p> <p>This is why the US is demanding that its new embassy in Berlin should be in an area totally open on all sides (never mind the historic district that will be obliterated).</p> <p>But abroad, generally, and in the Middle East, in particular, where both the present US administration and its Democratic contenders maintain that the country has vital interests, the asymmetrical attacks are coming to us in a much subtler way, as the deaths of the five MSF volunteers prove. </p> <p>Our enemies, while still doing daily battle for Falluja, keep conjuring up new ways to hurt us. Why not also blow up a gas line? Why not kill Turkish truck drivers? Why not destroy men lining up outside an Iraqi police station in the hope of recruitment? </p> <p>Above all, why not hit the \"soft\" parts of the international system? Why not bomb the UN headquarters in Baghdad and kill lots of outstanding people, including that remarkable ambassador for peace, Sergio Vieira de Mello? And, after you have committed such a terrible crime, why not, indeed, kill an MSF team? </p> <p>What could the next boundary of atrocity be? How far can this madness go? A nursing home in Chicago?</p> <p>There are no answers to such questions that, for me, carry any surety. And I am left, sadly, with John Donne's immortal poem about troubled times, the title of which is the headline of this humble piece. \"No man is an island, entire of itself,\" Donne wrote. All of us, not just in Asia and the Middle East, are going to feel the pressures described above. </p> <p>Not even the US can escape Donne's words these days.

  "The European commission has rejected claims by the British government that translation delays are -costing the lives of some of the world's poorest people by delaying them access to drugs. <p>A commission spokesman described as \"ridiculous\" allegations that victims of HIV/Aids and other potentially fatal ailments in developing countries were being denied treatment because of bureaucratic delays in Brussels. </p> <p>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, the trade and industry secretary Pa tricia Hewitt, and the development secretary, Hilary Benn, wrote to the commission last week to ask why it had not yet finalised draft -legislation needed before the UK can change its own laws to help developing countries import drugs. </p> <p>The EU trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, replied, rebutting the UK gov-ernment's criticisms. His letter confirms there is a delay in drafting key legislation that would give the world's poorest countries the right to import cheap, generic drugs by circumventing World Trade Organisation rules on patent protection. But he argues that while \"the problem of trans-lation is a real difficulty\" after enlargement, when the number of official languages increased to 20, \"it is not an issue in this case\". </p> <p>Mr Lamy insists that developing countries which wish to import generic drugs can do so without -risking litigation. </p> <p>A commission spokesman said that, while the EU law was not ready, developing countries could import generic drugs thanks to a waiver agreed by all the members of the WTO. </p> <p>Following complaints from developing countries and HIV/Aids char-ities, WTO members agreed in 2003 to allow the poorest nations to ignore patent protection rules on drugs produced by western pharmaceutical firms and import cheaper copies from generics manufacturers. </p> <p>In a clear expression of annoyance at the three ministers' statement, Mr Lamy writes: \"I hope that you will agree that comments made in the press . . . are emotive and unhelpful.\" </p> <p>In response a Treasury spokesman said: \"We are pleased that Mr Lamy accepts the importance of this issue and the need for urgent action. Given his assurances that translation is not causing the delay, we look forward to the implementation of this vital legislation at the earliest opportunity.\"</p>",
  "The debate over animal experimentation appears to be moving rapidly towards a state of mutual incomprehension and deadlock. The British home secretary is debating whether to allow the American animal rights activist Dr Jerry Vlasak into Britain after it was reported that he had said that killing five to 15 vivisectors could save millions of non-human lives. (He has subsequently denied that he was encouraging anyone to act in this way.) Animal activists have damaged trucks and other equipment used by construction companies working on Oxford University's new animal laboratory. Even the Guardian, in an editorial, likened British animal activists to al-Qaida terrorists. <p>The outcome of this process is unlikely to be positive for either side. For those who favour experiments on animals, it will mean keeping a low profile and meeting increased security costs. For the overwhelmingly non-violent animal movement, consisting of many millions of people around the world, there is a risk of serious damage from being identified with the handful of activists who are prepared to go beyond peaceful protest. </p> <p>This situation has arisen, in part, because the animal research community holds an ethical view that the animal movement rejects. That view is, in essence, that animals are things for us to use, as long as we spare them unnecessary pain. The animal activists, on the other hand, reject the assumption that animals are inferior beings, and that their interests should always be subordinate to our own. They see this as \"speciesism\" - a prejudice against beings that are not members of our own species, and similar in many respects to racist or sexist prejudices against beings who are not members of a dominant race or sex. </p> <p>Ironically, in this situation, it is the defenders of scientific research who are most likely to cling to an ethic that clearly has an unscientific basis. If we believe the account of creation given in Genesis, including its divine grant of dominion over all animals, then it makes sense to think that we are justified in using animals for our own purposes, as scientists wish to do. But if, on the other hand, we think Darwin was right, and we are all here because of an unplanned process of evolution, there is no reason to assume that human interests should always take precedence over the interests of non-human animals. As Jeremy Bentham wrote almost 200 years ago: \"The question is not 'Can they reason?', nor, 'Can they talk?', but 'Can they suffer?'\" </p> <p>It may be possible to carry out some experiments on animals that do not cause them to suffer. And it may even be that, consistently with Bentham's principles, one can imagine situations in which, without treating the interests of animals as less weighty than those of humans, the benefits of an experiment on an animal would outweigh the costs to the animal. But the entire institution of animal research, as it exists in Britain today, is based on a different foundation: that animals count for less, and those that we are not especially fond of count for less still. Otherwise why would Oxford University have said, in defending its proposed laboratory, that \"98% of the animals involved would be rodents?\" Does the university believe that the interests of rats do not count? </p> <p>Those who oppose treating animals as if they were mere tools for research therefore have a strong ethical argument. But when a few people use violence and intimidation to achieve the desired goal, they undermine the animal movement's ethical basis. In a democratic society change should come about through education and persuasion, not intimidation. </p> <p>Those who advocate violence may claim, with some justice, that the democratic process has been tried, and has failed. Despite decades of widespread popular support for reform, little has changed. Even the recent Guardian editorial that began with the incendiary comparison between al-Qaida and animal rights extremists observed that more should be invested in finding alternatives - and it pointed out that a House of Lords committee stacked with scientists made the same recommendation two years ago. Yet in comparison to the funds that go into research using animals, the amount spent on developing alternatives is still very small. The extremist tactics we are now seeing may well be the result of the frustration caused by the failure of the democratic process to lead even to measures on which virtually everyone agrees. </p> <p>Nevertheless I cannot support the use of violence in the cause of animal liberation. It sets a dangerous precedent - or, one might say, it follows dangerous precedents. In the United States, \"pro-life\" extremists have fire-bombed abortion clinics and murdered doctors who terminate pregnancies. I consider these defenders of the sanctity of human life from conception to be misguided; but no doubt they are just as sincere in their convictions as defenders of animals. It is difficult to find democratic principles that would allow one group to use intimidation and violence, and deny the same methods to the other. </p> <p>Non-violent responses to the frustrations of the democratic process do less damage to the fabric of civil society. Gandhi and Martin Luther King have shown that civil disobedience can be an effective means of demonstrating one's sincerity and commitment to a just cause, while at the same time eschewing violence. Those who break the law openly, and are prepared to pay the price for doing so, are more likely to gain the respect and support of the public than those who strike secretly in the dark, and use fear, rather than persuasion, to change behaviour. </p> <p>Is there a way out of the present deadlock? Some opponents of experiments on animals will be satisfied with nothing less than the immediate and total abolition of all animal research. In a society that continues to eat meat, however, that is an unrealistic goal. If people think that their enjoyment of the taste of animal flesh is sufficient reason to confine millions of animals in horrific factory farms, transport them to slaughterhouses and then kill them, why would they reject the use of relatively smaller numbers of animals in experiments designed to find cures for major diseases? </p> <p>The mainstream animal movement has repeatedly condemned the use of violence against sentient beings, human or non-human. My own statements against it now stretch back nearly 20 years. But every large movement attracts extremists who are impatient at the slow pace of change. There is little more that the non-violent majority of the animal movement can do. The next step is really up to the government and the research community. If animal activists could see that serious efforts were being made to find new ways of doing research without animals, the violent fringe of the movement would become even more isolated than it now is. </p> <p> Peter Singer is professor of bioethics at Princeton University.

  "Carmen bin Ladin and her daughters, Wafah, Najia and Noor, are the only Bin Ladins in the western world to be listed in the telephone book. They live in Switzerland, where Carmen grew up and where she fled to 20 years ago from her marriage to Osama's older brother, Yeslam bin Ladin. I am to meet her at a hotel on Lake Geneva today, because she wants to talk about what life was like inside the Bin Laden clan (she differentiates between her immediate family and the wider Bin Ladens by altering the spelling of the name - her only concession to obscurity). For nine years she lived at the heart of the world's most notorious family and the only way to exorcise this, she believes, is to spill the beans. The Bin Ladens would like her to shut up; but she will not even go ex-directory. <p>Unsurprisingly the lives of Bin Ladin and her children have been enormously difficult since September 11. We sit on the hotel terrace. Bin Ladin twitches and jitters, chain smoking, and apologising for her English. Her father was Swiss, her mother Iranian and she grew up speaking French in Geneva. When people walk by, she lowers her voice. </p> <p>Bin Ladin's book, The Veiled Kingdom , is one she would rather not have written, given the hostility it will in all likelihood generate from an already hostile family. But she wanted to explain to her daughters why she fled their father's house and, to the world, why she continues to carry his name. She also, I gather, hopes that the book will do something to alleviate the loneliness of her position; she is at once exiled from the society of her husband and from polite society in the West, where the name Bin Ladin doesn't open many doors. \"For 14 years I fought alone. And nobody believed me. I fought the Bin Laden clan in private.\" This is a plea for her struggle to be recognised. </p> <p>Carmen Dufour met Yeslam Bin Laden in 1973, when he rented a floor of her mother's house in Geneva for the summer. She was already accustomed to luxury; her mother's family, the Sheibanys, were Persian aristocrats. But Yeslam came from a background of quite staggering wealth. He was 24, a little older than her, the 10th son of Sheikh Mohamed bin Laden, one of the wealthiest men in Saudi Arabia. After they married, they moved to Los Angeles to study at the University of Southern California and then, in 1976, Yeslam asked her to return to Jeddah with him, so he could work in the family firm: multi-billion dollar construction company, the Bin Laden Corporation. She reluctantly agreed. \"I loved my husband,\" she says. \"That's it.\" </p> <p>The life that awaited her in Saudi Arabia was one that her husband tried to prepare her for, but which still came as a shock. They moved to Kilometre Seven, a district of Jeddah where most of Bin Laden Sr's 22 wives, 25 sons and 29 daughters lived. Bin Ladin made her first mistake minutes after stepping off the plane, where one of Yeslam's brothers had come to meet her. \"Hi, Ibrahim!\" she called and wondered why he frowned so, before remembering that women were not permitted to speak to men in public. She would make the same mistake, some time later and to more violent effect, with another of Yeslam's brothers: Osama. </p> <p>In the meantime Bin Ladin had some fitting in to do. She writes in the book that adapting to Saudi life was like undergoing an anaesthetic. \"Only the men could come and go as they pleased. We women were confined to the house . . . even to go into the garden we had to notify the male employees to vacate the premises.\" She couldn't go anywhere without a chaperone. \"We took no exercise. Walking anywhere was unthinkable. Hotels, sports arenas, theatres, swimming pools, restaurants, if they existed at all, were only for men.\" And yet, she says, she had high hopes for the future both of the country and of her marriage; Yeslam was one of the more liberal of the brothers, a fact he had demonstrated while they were engaged by \"allowing\" her to smoke in front of his brothers. Breaking with custom, he asked her opinion before making decisions and groused to her about the inefficient workings of the family business. </p> <p>The life she led was subtly superior to that of her sisters-in-law: she didn't wear a veil when travelling by car; she held tennis parties at the house; she smuggled in banned books from trips to Switzerland (the Bin Laden name ensured that her luggage was never searched); and she was permitted by her husband to instruct the carpet-fitters on what she wanted for their front room. (They threw a fit at being spoken to by a woman and went straight to Yeslam, who backed his wife.) She won a major feminist victory by crossing the road unaccompanied. Things were looking up. </p> <p>And then she met Osama. He was a student at the King Abdel Aziz University in Jeddah. When she opened the door to him one day, he freaked out. Her face was uncovered. Osama started flapping his hands and wouldn't come in until she had made herself scarce. She only met him a couple of times after that. While his zealousness was extreme, he did not seem remarkable to her, either within the family or the wider Saudi culture. \"He was very religious, but he was not the only one being that religious. He had other brothers who were that religious. Some of the other brothers seemed more westernised, like my husband, but deep down their beliefs were closer to Saudi Arabia than the western world. Deep down this was their way of seeing.\" </p> <p>Contrary to her expectations, the country never did liberalise and it wasn't until Bin Ladin had her second child that she began to exhaust her husband's liberal streak. He resented the way she was bringing them up. He told her the children were not permitted to celebrate their birthdays as this was a Christian affectation. He made no attempt to assuage his wife's concerns about what would happen were he to die: in Saudi culture, the widow is bequeathed to her husband's surviving male relatives. They lived in palatial splendour (she cattily remarks in the book that the Bin Ladens have no taste in interior decor, all gold taps and terrible paintings) and it wasn't unusual for Yeslam to give her $50,000 to go out shopping with. But he started to exclude her from his decisions and, after a fall-out with his brothers, he struck out alone and made another fortune - she puts it at $300m - when he set up Saudi Arabia's first brokerage firm. The deranged double life they led wore her out; one weekend she and the girls would be water-skiing in France, the next encased in black cloth, virtual prisoners in their own home. </p> <p>\"There was always a part of me that kept worrying about the future of the girls. I sometimes wonder whether I'd have been so observant if I had had two boys. You see? My main responsibility went to the future of my daughters.\" </p> <p>As the marriage disintegrated, she started to think about getting out. \"I didn't know any other foreigner who was married to a Saudi who was able to keep her children and bring them up.\" Luckily Bin Ladin had kept her Swiss passport and in 1985, on a trip to Geneva, she informed her husband that she had no intention of returning to Saudi. They lived together in Switzerland for a while and had a third daughter, but the marriage was effectively over and in 1994 Carmen started divorce proceedings. They are still going on. For a while she kept in touch with some of her sisters-in-law in Saudi, but they have been silent since September 11. </p> <p>When news of the attacks reached her, Bin Ladin says she thought immediately of her brother-in-law. She hadn't spoken about him with her husband since 1994, when Yeslam told her that Osama was in Sudan. But she had followed his activities in the press, his connection to the first bombing of the World Trade Centre and that of the US embassy in Tanzania. \"And when the second plane hit, I knew that their name would be involved.\" </p> <p>All of which makes it so strange that she should choose to hang on to the name. \"I discussed it with the girls and we realised very deeply . . . we came to the conclusion that unfortunately the name is too well known; that people would just say, 'Oh, in reality she is a Bin Laden, she changed her name.' Like people still talk about Hitler's nephew changing his name. There is no escape. The best thing is to face it and to explain that we are westerners carrying the name. We fought to gain our freedom; the truth always comes out.\" </p> <p>After the attacks, the phone more or less stopped ringing. All four of them lost friends. They couldn't get bookings in hotels or restaur-ants. Some months before the attacks, her eldest daughter, Wafah, had returned to Switzerland from the US where she'd studied law at Columbia University. She decided not to go back. They have visited the US once since then, informing the US embassy in advance so as not to cause panic at immigration when their name was read on their passports. </p> <p>Wafah is 26 and finding it hard to get work, as is her 24-year-old sister (the youngest is still at school). \"It is understandable,\" says Bin Ladin, \"that an employer may worry whether his clients will be offended that he has hired a Bin Laden. The situation is very complicated and I don't know when it is going to clear up. These three girls are trapped. It's a fact they carry a name, it's a fact they have values that don't correspond to that name.\" </p> <p>They have been totally rejected by the Bin Laden clan. \"When they come to Europe they don't even call. Since 9/11 not even their father has called to see how they are coping with this situation.\" And she is unconvinced that they have cut off all ties with Osama. \"They have never condemned Osama. They have condemned the terrorist act. But they have never admitted any involvement of their brother in those acts. He has sons in Saudi Arabia who work at the organisation. When my mothers-in-law used to speak of him, especially after he had gone to Afghanistan, it was with pure admiration. They respect his faith.\" </p> <p>The life Bin Ladin lives in Geneva is not a happy one, but where, she asks, can she go? She feels as if she has been fighting for a very long time. She is tired now, but she hopes her resources will outstrip those of her husband and his family. \"You cannot change, you cannot hide, you have to face it. Our only way out is to explain. We stand and this is how we are.\" She puts her hands over eyes. She is shaking.</p>",
  "Ken Loach is a prolific film director who is prepared to put in a lot of time and effort when it comes to practising his craft. But the rest he finds more difficult, to judge from his flat voice and weary expression when we met late on a hot summer afternoon after he had spent the whole day being interviewed about his new film, Ae Fond Kiss (just released in France). <p>\"Promoting a film requires as much energy as making one, so I have to be careful not to use it all up, particularly as I always like to move straight on to the next movie,\" he explained. \"And then making a film is a pragmatic pro-cess.

It's something I'm wary of talking about, as I wouldn't want to think up rational justifications for my instincts.\" </p> <p>From the start of his career, Loach's instincts have been to demand a better world.

It's also a good way of sparking debate.\" </p> <p>Loach was born in the Midlands in 1936, the year that Popular Front governments came to power in both France and Spain. He read law at Oxford. His already keen political awareness led him to work in the theatre and move in leftwing activist circles. The television producer Tony Garnett got him to make films for the BBC, and his low-budget \"Wednesday Play\" docudramas caused a sensation with their screenplays based on a clinical observation of real life. </p> <p>One of the films in that series, Cathy Come Home (1966), described how a couple crippled by debts are evicted from their home. It provoked controversy at national level. Loach later said of his team on the film: \"We were social democrats when we made that film and would-be Marxists when we finished it. We realised the inability of social democrats to do anything constructive.\" </p> <p> Cathy Come Home directly contributed to political change. It played a key role in the setting up of Shelter, a movement that aimed to provide a roof for homeless families, and influenced a political debate that resulted in a change in the law in 1977. </p> <p>After an experience like that, it would have been understandable if the young Loach had come to believe he could improve society. Yet he insists: \"I never said to myself that my films could change things. With Cathy Come Home, something exceptional happened that was impossible to predict or reproduce. After that I simply went on doing my job. A movie isn't a political movement, a party or even an article. It's just a film. At best it can add its voice to public outrage.\" </p> <p>Margaret Thatcher's years as prime minister (1979-90) were a bad time for Loach: he had difficulty in getting his films distributed or shown on television. But since the beginning of the 90s he has been making movie after movie and can rely on a bedrock of \"faithful spectators\". \"I'm aware that without the support of European filmgoers I'd have ceased to come up with funding for my movies a long time ago.\" </p> <p>It is \"instinct\" again that, in his view, explains his special relationship with the public. When he turns his attention away from the fate of the B-ritish working class to focus on disillusioned revolutionaries ( Carla's Song , 1996) or the Spanish Civil War ( Land and Freedom , 1995), audiences continue to be interested - probably because \"those films simply talk about real people\". </p> <p>Loach's working methods leave room for the unexpected, for \"intrusions of reality\". \"To my mind the worst thing of all is the storyboard,\" he says with a shudder. \"I find it cramps my style to determine in advance what's going to take place before the camera. Anything that sets in stone is bad. What counts is exploration.\" </p> <p>While Loach was shooting My Name Is Joe (1998) - \"A film about an alcoholic who doesn't drink\", he says with a grin - he realised that he had not fully explored one of the characters: \"There was a lad in the football team who interested me. He became Liam in Sweet Sixteen [2002].\" </p> <p>After that grim chronicle about a solitary teenager, Ae Fond Kiss comes across as a more light-hearted movie. It is a very complicated love story between a Muslim Scot of Pakistani origin and a Catholic Irishwoman. \"Paul Laverty, who works with me, writes very precise screenplays. Subsequently there has to be some room for manoeuvre for the actors, so they can reveal themselves and the characters they play. In Ae Fond Kiss the actors took over the movie. They gave it a degree of optimism, and I was delighted: they weren't just marionettes.\" </p> <p>Very few filmmakers have such a modest notion of their own role as Loach. In fact it was only when he started talking to me about politics, not the cinema, that he forgot how tired he was after all those hours of promoting the movie and holding forth on \"communities that don't know each other well enough\". </p> <p>He described how he joined the club of politically committed filmmakers, such as the Italian Nanni Moretti: \"I was asked if I'd like to be on a leftwing list for the European elections [in June]. I couldn't refuse. We got almost 5% in London, which isn't bad. But an anti-European, xenophobic section of the right also did very well at those elections. Those people would like to make the Channel wider if they could. That's not really surprising when you look at the Sun or the Daily Mail, which are filled day after day with racist remarks and innuendo about how Europe is too bureaucratic to be honest.\" </p> <p>Loach likes Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 , which won the top Cannes award this year: \"It was a political prize, whatever Tarantino's claims to the contrary, and that could prove very useful.\" In 2002, in his contribution to the collective movie, 11\"09'01 , Loach gave his own view of September 11. He has not returned to the subject since, but deals indirectly with its repercussions as they affect the Muslim male lead in Ae Fond Kiss . </p> <p>\"Laverty was struck by the upsurge in racist violence in the United States just after September 11, and in particular by the death of a young Sikh in Arizona. The way our western societies look at Muslims is problematic.\" </p> <p>Loach shares Moore's view of President George Bush, but Ae Fond Kiss does not focus on his British ally, Tony Blair, whose policies fill Loach with indignation: \"Britain is in an extraordinary situation: a supposedly centre-left party has been implementing a hardline neoliberal policy involving privatisations. Blair supports America's policy and a war based on lies. And who are the Labour party's main allies? [The Italian prime minister Silvio] Berlusconi and Bush. That has left a vacuum on the left, which is tragic.\" </p> <p>Loach became convinced of one thing when canvassing at the European elections: \"The left has to do some hard thinking if it is to take advantage of the present hostility towards the Labour party.\" Meanwhile Loach is off to shoot a new film in Rome: \"It is, after all, my job.\" </p> <p> Ae Fond Kiss will be released in Britain on September 3</p>",

  "<p>Professor Southall:</p> <p>In November 1999 Sally Clark was convicted of the murder of her two children, Christopher and Harry Clark.&#xa0; On or about 27 April 2000 you watched the \"Dispatches\" programme about the Sally Clark case that was broadcast on Channel 4 television that night.&#xa0; As a result of information gleaned during your watching of the programme, on the next day you contacted the Child Protection Unit of the Staffordshire Police to voice concerns about how the abuse to Christopher and Harry Clark had in fact occurred. Following this contact, on 2 June 2000 you met </p> <p>Detective Inspector Gardner of the Cheshire Constabulary, the senior investigating officer into the deaths of Christopher and Harry Clark, and in effect told him that, as a result of watching the programme, you considered that Stephen Clark, Sally Clark's husband, had deliberately suffocated his son Christopher Clark at a hotel prior to his eventual death.&#xa0; Stephen Clark was thus implicated in the deaths of both Christopher and Harry Clark.&#xa0; Based on this opinion, you raised concern about Stephen Clark's access to, and the safety of, the Clarks' third child, Child A.</p> <p>At time of meeting Detective Inspector Gardner, you were not connected with the case.&#xa0; You made it clear that you were acting in your capacity as a consultant paediatrician with considerable experience of life threatening child abuse and that you were suspended from your duties by your employers, the North Staffordshire Hospital NHS Trust (\"the Trust\"). You knew that it was an agreed term of the Trust's enquiries that led to your suspension that you would not undertake any new outside child protection work without the prior permission of the Acting Medical Director of the Trust.&#xa0; Despite this, you had not sought permission of the Acting Medical Director prior to contacting the Child Protection Unit of the Staffordshire Police and meeting with Detective Inspector Gardner. You relied on the contents of the \"Dispatches\" television programme as the principal factual source for your concerns. You had a theory about the case that you presented as fact as underpinned by your own research.&#xa0; The Committee found your actions in contacting the child protection unit of the Staffordshire Police to be precipitate and by not seeking the permission of the Acting Medical Director of the Trust before meeting D I Gardner to be precipitate and irresponsible.</p> <p>On 30 August 2000 you produced a report on the Clark family at the request of Forshaws, Solicitors.&#xa0; At the time that you produced your report you did not have any access to the case papers, including any medical records, laboratory investigations, post-mortem records, medical reports or x-rays.&#xa0; You had not interviewed either Stephen or Sally Clark.&#xa0; Your report concluded that it was extremely likely if not certain that Mr Clark had suffocated Christopher in the hotel room.&#xa0; You remained convinced that the third child of the Clark family, Child A, was unsafe in the hands of Mr Clark.&#xa0; Your report implied that Mr Clark was responsible for the deaths of his two eldest children Christopher and Harry.&#xa0; This was based on a theory that you had about the case that you presented as fact, as underpinned by your own research.&#xa0; Your report declared that its contents were true and may be used in a court of law whereas it contained matters the truth of which you could not have known or did not know. Your report contained no caveat to the effect that its conclusions were based upon the very limited information about the case known to you.</p> <p>When given the opportunity to place such a caveat in your report you declined, by faxed email dated 11 September 2000, stating that even without all the evidence being made available to you it was likely beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Clark was responsible for the deaths of his two other children. The Committee have found your actions as described above to be individually and collectively inappropriate, irresponsible, misleading and an abuse of your professional position.</p> <p>The Committee are extremely concerned by the facts of this case. The Committee have heard that a formal complaint was made against you in January 1999.&#xa0; The Trust placed a limitation on your work preventing you from undertaking any category 2 work (work that is commissioned by an external agency) pending the outcome of their investigations. You agreed to the Trust's request. Due to the seriousness of their concerns in November 1999 the Trust suspended you for the duration of their inquiry and you were therefore prevented from undertaking any child protection work.&#xa0; </p> <p>The Committee have heard that you had been following the Clark case with interest as a proportion of your clinical and research work involved the sudden and unexpected deaths of infants and on 27 April 2000 you watched the Channel 4 Dispatches programme which featured an interview with Steven Clark. As a result of viewing the programme, you formed the definite view that Mr Clark had murdered both Christopher and Harry and that accordingly not only had the wrong person been convicted but that the life of the remaining child (child A) was in danger by virtue of the fact that he was being cared for by Mr Clark. You were so convinced of your opinion that you contacted the local child protection team, and subsequently met with Detective Inspector Gardiner, the police officer in charge of the case.&#xa0; The matter was reported to Social Services and subsequently there was a meeting between yourself, Social Services and the Guardian of child A. This in turn led to Social Services convening a Child Protection Planning meeting. The result of this meeting was that you were asked to produce a report and the matter was investigated further. You did produce such a report, dated 30 August 2000, in which you concluded that Steven Clark was responsible for the deaths of both Christopher and Harry and that the Clark's third child was unsafe in his care. </p> <p>The Committee are extremely concerned that you came to this view without ever meeting or interviewing Mr or Mrs Clark, without seeing any of the medical reports, post mortem reports and without knowledge of the discussions between the experts or witnesses involved with the Sally Clark case.&#xa0; You did not put yourself in a position to give a meaningful explanation. Your view was a theory, which was however not presented as a theory but as a near certainty.&#xa0; Your hypothesis, based on your research, was that the nosebleed that Christopher suffered in the hotel room whilst alone with Mr Clark was a result of an assault.&#xa0; Your view is that a bilateral nose bleed in an infant in the absence an identifiable disease or accident, was virtually always the consequence of life threatening child abuse, usually an attempted smothering.&#xa0; We heard from Professor David, the GMC expert witness that in order to come to such a firm view, one must explore all the potential causal explanations for the nose bleed and detail this process in the findings. In your evidence you stated you did not do this, as it was known to all the recipients of the report that you did not have access to any other documentation.&#xa0; However you have accepted that it would have been good practice to have detailed the diagnostic process in your report.&#xa0; </p> <p>The Committee have been directed to the guidance entitled 'Expert Witnesses in Children Act Cases' produced by Mr Justice Wall, which you have acknowledged as good guidance.&#xa0; However, it appears that you did not follow this guidance in the circumstances of this case.&#xa0; Paragraph 5.4 states that 'You should be very cautious when advising a judge that in your opinion a particular event occurred.&#xa0; You should do this only if you feel you have all the relevant information.' You accepted the fact that you should have made it clear in your report that you did not have access to any documents and that the views expressed were based solely on watching the Dispatches programme. The guidance further states at paragraph 10.5 'What the court is anxious to prevent is any unrecorded informal discussions between particular experts which are either influential in, or determinative of, their views and to which the parties to the proceedings do not have access.' You further conceded the fact that you should have disclosed the involvement of Professor Roy Meadow and Professor Green who you stated helped confirm your theory on the case. Your reason for this omission was out of concern for them as they had given evidence at the trial of Sally Clark.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; </p> <p>As a potential Expert Witness, you had a duty to list in your report the limitations of either the method you used to come to your conclusion or the results. The Committee were concerned by the fact that when given the opportunity to add a caveat to your report to state that your views were based solely on your viewing of the TV programme and not on any other evidence, you refused to do so. In fact your opinion was put in more concrete terms by using the words 'beyond all reasonable doubt'.&#xa0; </p> <p>The Committee accept that as a Consultant Paediatrician you had a duty to report any concerns that you may have regarding child safety with other professionals, but as you were prevented from undertaking any new child protection work due to the suspension imposed on you, you should have contacted Dr Chipping, Medical Director as the terms of your suspension required, prior to taking any action. </p> <p>The Committee also accept that the nature of child protection is such that sometimes concerns are raised which prove to be unfounded.&#xa0; However, despite this, there is a duty of care to raise such concerns in order to ensure the protection of children.</p> <p>Taking into account the facts found proved against you including inappropriate and irresponsible behaviour and an abuse of your professional position, the Committee consider your conduct amounts to a serious departure from the standards expected from a registered medical practitioner. The GMC's guidance Good Medical Practice (July 1998) states that 'Good clinical care must include an adequate assessment of the patient's condition, based on the history, and clinical signs and if necessary an appropriate examination'.&#xa0; In providing care you must 'recognise and work within the limits of your professional competence', 'be competent when making diagnoses and when giving or arranging treatment.' You did not adhere to this guidance when you involved yourself in this case.&#xa0; You must also 'respond constructively to assessments and appraisals of your professional competence and performance'.&#xa0; GMP further states under the heading 'If things go wrong' that 'If a patient under your care has suffered serious harm, you should act immediately to put things right.&#xa0; When appropriate you should offer an apology'. GMP further states that 'Registered medical practitioners have the authority to sign a variety of documents, on the assumption that they will only sign statements they believe to be true.&#xa0; This means that you must take reasonable steps to verify any statement before you sign a document'.&#xa0; The Committee do not believe that you did take reasonable steps before you signed the report on the Clark case.&#xa0; Your failure to adhere to these principles resulted in substantial stress to Mr Clark and his family at a time when they were most vulnerable and could have resulted in Child A being taken back into care unnecessarily and Mr Clark's prosecution as a result of your false allegation.&#xa0; The committee are concerned that at no time during these proceedings have you seen fit to withdraw these allegations or to offer any apology.</p> <p>Taking all these matters into account, the Committee find you guilty of serious professional misconduct.</p> <p>In considering whether to take action in relation to your registration, the Committee have considered the issue of proportionality and have balanced the interests of the public against your own. The Committee have given careful consideration to the submissions made on your behalf and on behalf of the GMC and Mr Clark.&#xa0; It has also considered carefully the GMC's Indicative Sanctions Document.&#xa0; The Committee have been extremely impressed by the vast number of and the quality of testimonials that have been put before them.&#xa0; It is clear from the testimonials that you are held in the highest esteem by your professional colleagues both in the United Kingdom and internationally. They all testify to your outstanding clinical skills and unparalleled commitment to the welfare of children all over the world.&#xa0; In particular we have noted the comments of Professor Sir Alan Craft, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) who states that there has been no doubt that you have been an academic leader and that you have undertaken extremely important ground breaking research which 'has greatly influenced the way that babies and children have been managed all over the world.'&#xa0;&#xa0; The testimonials dealt with not only your research work, but also your work in paediatrics and child protection. There are many references to your unstinting involvement in the care of seriously ill children both within your own Trust and wider afield. Your colleagues have testified of your willingness to help them when faced with difficult cases no matter the personal cost to yourself.&#xa0; The Committee have also heard and have been impressed by the fact that you set up Child Advocacy International, a charitable organization which helps and promotes the welfare of sick children in less privileged parts of the world.&#xa0; The Committee notes that prior to this hearing you have more than 30 years of unblemished medical practice.</p> <p>The Committee have taken into account the evidence of Dr Chipping, Medical Director who appeared before the Committee to give an oral testimony on your behalf. Dr Chipping stated that since your return to work in October 2001, you have only worked in the area of general paediatrics and that you no longer involve yourself in paediatric intensive care or indeed in child protection work.</p> <p>The Committee nevertheless concluded that the findings against you reflect a serious breach of the principles of Good Medical Practice and the standards of conduct, which the public are entitled to expect from registered medical practitioners and the Committee therefore feel obliged to take action in the public interest. In reaching this conclusion the Committee have borne in mind the Privy Council judgement in the case of Dr Gupta (Privy Council Appeal No. 44 of 2001) which states that:</p> <p>\"The reputation of the profession is more important than the fortunes of any individual member. Membership of a profession brings many benefits, but that is part of the price.\"</p> <p>In considering what action to take against your registration, the Committee recognise that taking no action and concluding this case with a reprimand would be wholly inappropriate.&#xa0; </p> <p>In the circumstances, the Committee have concluded that in your own and the public interest it must take action regarding your registration.&#xa0; Based on the findings on facts in this case and your apparent lack of insight the Committee have decided that it would be inappropriate for you to continue with child protection work for the foreseeable future.

Shops will also be banned from selling fireworks louder than 120 decibels. </p> <p>Exceptions have been made for special occasions, with revellers celebrating the new year, Diwali and the Chinese new year given until 1am to let off fireworks; November 5 bonfire displays, however, must be over by midnight. </p> <p>Gerry Sutcliffe, the consumer minister, said: \"Fireworks can be fun but can also cause misery for communities, especially for vulnerable people, such as the elderly, and animals. </p> <p>\"Introducing a curfew and a noise limit balances the law to ensure that people can still enjoy fireworks while cracking down on their antisocial use.\" </p> <p>Shops wanting to sell fireworks all year round will need to apply for a licence from their local council; other suppliers, such as newsagents, will be able to sell them only during limit periods. </p> <p>The number of people in the UK injured by fireworks in 2003 was up slightly on the previous year, with 1,136 people treated in hospital casualty departments compared with 1,017 in 2002. </p> <p>But the injury statistics from the department of trade and industry also revealed that the majority of accidents were minor, with only 5% of people needing to stay in hospital overnight. </p> <p>The DTI welcomed the new legislation as a good step forward in cutting down on the \"nuisance\" use of fireworks but added that the illegal trade in fireworks to underage youngsters was an area that still needed to be monitored. </p> <p>The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals sad the measures did not go far enough.</p> <p>In a submission to the government, the RSPCA called for a lower, 95-decibel limit and for official firework display organisers to be forced to notify local pet owners.</p> <p>Steve Cheetham, the RSPCA's chief veterinary officer, said: \"This legislation does nothing to alleviate the suffering of animals, and the government has missed a great opportunity to do something about it. </p> <p>\"Its failure to sufficiently reduce the noise level of fireworks means thousands of animals will continue to suffer. </p> <p>\"We have received a huge amount of support for our campaign for quieter fireworks and there will be many disappointed pet owners up and down the country.\"</p>",
  "The cold war was a time of hot diplomacy. Because in Europe the great contest of the second half of the last century was deadlocked on the battlefield, it was fought largely at superpower summit meetings and lower-level arms control talks. The subject matter was technical and, barring an occasional breakthrough, progress was slow. But the issues were huge, and for that reason politicians and the press followed the negotiations closely. <p>Now the stage is reversed. A plethora of hot wars over the last decade has turned people cold on diplomacy. The Churchillian adage that jaw-jaw is better than war-war is forgotten in favour of the faulty notion that applying superior military power is the best way to handle stubborn political conflicts. </p> <p>One reason is television, which increasingly sets the agenda for newspapers as well as governments. If there is no image there is no message, so political negotiations are condemned as inherently dull, if not irrelevant, compared to the visual drama of war. The other is the cult of impatience, caused by the new craze for humanitarian intervention and the excessive injection of morality into international disputes. If a conflict is projected as a struggle against evil-doers, then there is not a moment to lose. Delay itself becomes a form of moral appeasement and wickedness. When military action is crowned with rapid results and the bad guys' defeat, as in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, the illusion is created that a solution has been reached. </p> <p>The current media-driven push for military intervention in Sudan's western province of Darfur has all the hallmarks of the run-up to the west's last three wars. The fact that none has yet produced stability or justice is overlooked. </p> <p>The narrative in Darfur, which has been told repeatedly in recent weeks, is not new. Douglas Johnson's authoritative study, The Root Causes of Sudan's Civil Wars, describes how war has been going on in Darfur at a low level among different groups of herdsmen and farmers for two decades. Successive Arab-led governments in Khartoum took sides, using Janjaweed militias, designated in 1989 as popular defence forces, who targeted villagers, killed and displaced civilians, and burned crops while the divide between \"Arabs\" and \"Blacks\" was deliberately sharpened. </p> <p>What has changed is the emergence of two ambitious rebel movements with political agendas, their decision to launch surprise attacks on government garrisons, and Khartoum's over-reaction with the use of air power and helicopter gunships. The government also gave a green light to the Janjaweed for widespread raids on villages that support the rebels. </p> <p>In spite of this disastrous escalation, a peace process has begun. Not many conflicts of this intensity have a channel for negotiations as well as international observers to try to keep them on track. Getting talks started while fighting is under way is usually a major hurdle. </p> <p>In having a peace track Darfur is lucky, though one would not know it from most media commentaries, with their impatience for sanctions or military action. Virtually every report of last week's UN security council resolution, which gave Sudan 30 days to show progress in disarming the Janjaweed, avoided mention of a paragraph which made demands on the rebels too. It criticised their leaders' boycott of the latest peace talks. It urged them to stop their ceasefire violations and drop all preconditions for attending the next round of talks under African Union sponsorship. </p> <p>Darfur is also lucky in that the gap between the parties is not as wide as in many conflicts. Neither rebel movement is calling for independence. This is not Kosovo or Chechnya. A model for the autonomy they want for their western region exists in the deal reached this year between Khartoum and the southern rebels. To expand that agreement to take in Darfur or forge one on the southern formula of decentralisation and wealth-sharing ought not to be too hard. </p> <p>Diplomats and experts on Sudan say the rebel movements are not clear who to designate as leaders, or how representative the current spokespeople are. Some hesitate to attend talks for fear of being exposed or denounced. Another problem is that the rebels may think they can get their way, in the present climate of anti-Khartoum moralising, without compromise or long-term thinking. </p> <p>In any hostile intervention a key test is regional backing. On Kosovo, though there was no UN mandate for war, European governments took the initiative for military action. There was no comparable backing for the US-led wars on Afghanistan and Iraq from most of those countries' neighbours. Similarly in Darfur, the African Union has no interest in military interference against Khartoum's wishes, especially now that the government has agreed to an African ceasefire monitoring force. </p> <p>So, instead of talk of western military intervention, pressure needs to be put on the rebels to pick genuine representatives and get to the negotiating table. The Sudanese government is also divided - between hardliners who hope for military victory if the talks fail and those willing to listen to the African Union. Khartoum bears primary responsibility for the excessive use of force. But division among the rebels is the major obstacle to restoring the peace process. </p> <p>Like Sudan until the Darfur eruption, Sri Lanka was one of the world's few good-news stories of 2002-03. There too, after a long civil war between the Singhalese majority and Tamil Tiger rebels, international mediation produced a ceasefire and peace talks. </p> <p>Now they are under threat. The culprits are not western television or impatient humanitarian interventionists. A small island with no oil or strategic value, Sri Lanka was largely ignored in war and peace. Even a death toll of 64,000 over 18 years made little impact abroad. Its problems are internal. On the Singhalese side the peace talks, mediated by Norway, were treated as a political football. President Chandrika Kumaratunga claimed the government had made too many concessions, and got her party back in power by appealing to nationalists. </p> <p>On the Tigers' side, a split between the northern and eastern leaderships has become a campaign of assassinations, which has raised anxieties about their willingness to accept democracy. Meanwhile, the army made links with the eastern rebels. The Tigers' northern leaders accuse it of not backing a return to peace talks which have been suspended for 18 months. </p> <p>In strong terms for mediators, the Norwegians denounce both sides' \"incredible complacency\". \"What we're seeing now is a frozen war that is starting to melt at the edges\", as their envoy Vidar Helgesen puts it. The island's slip back to war shows how difficult it is - even with no Darfur-style foreign clamour - to get a political settlement without calm and effective leadership, preparation of public opinion and transparency. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Jonathan Steele, the Guardian's senior foreign correspondent, will be talking on Iraq at an open forum at the American Sociological Association's annual conference at the Hilton Hotel, San Francisco, on Saturday August 14 at 2.15pm</p>",
  "Saudi Arabia has captured one of its most wanted militants, officials announced today. <p>Faris al-Zahrani, an anti-western cleric who was number 12 on the list of Saudi Arabia's 26 most wanted, was arrested without any resistance as he sat in a caf\u00e9 in the kingdom's mountainous Abha province, close to the Yemen border.</p> <p>Mr Zahrani - one of three clerics on the list - was said to have played a leading role in al-Qaida's network in the country after its leader, Abdul Aziz al-Muqrin, was killed by security forces in June.</p> <p>\"Security forces were able on Thursday evening to capture one of the heads of strife, and an advocate of bombings,\" interior ministry officials last night told the state-run al-Arabiya television station. They described Mr Zahrani as \"a preacher of denouncing people as infidels\".</p> <p>Officials said Mr Zahrani and his accomplice, who was not named for security reasons, were detained \"swiftly and efficiently,\" and had not been able to use the weapons they were carrying. </p> <p>Saudi security forces have stepped up anti-terror operations after a marked increase in attacks in the kingdom followed a series of suicide attacks in May last year. Attacks have, for the first time, also deliberately targeted western workers and foreign assets. </p> <p>The Saudi crackdown also saw the introduction of a month-long amnesty which spared militants who gave themselves up the death penalty.</p> <p>The capture of Mr Zahrani, described as a recruiter for al-Qaida, is a boost for the kingdom, which has now detained or killed all but 11 on its most wanted list. Just four weeks ago, he boasted about how he was evading police.</p> <p>In an article he published in Voice of Jihad, a website sympathetic to al-Qaida, he said: \"I would like to reassure the people who love me. I am careful in my movements and contacts, and I take all necessary precautions.\" </p> <p>In the article, he rejected the limited amnesty that King Fahd had offered militants in June. Six terror suspects took advantage of the amnesty - which ended in late July - the most prominent of them being Khaled al-Harby, a confidant of Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Among those still at large are Saleh Mohammed al-Aoofi, a former prison guard believed to have been promoted after the killing of al-Muqrin. </p> <p>In today's Saudi press agency report, an official said: \"The interior ministry wishes to emphasise to all people that the security forces are determined to pursue the terrorists, get them out of their holes, and apply God's law to them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Strike action that could have blacked out the Olympic opening ceremony and the return of Match of the Day next weekend has been cancelled, after broadcasting union Bectu claimed the BBC had threatened legal action. </p> <p>Bectu unveiled plans last month for strike action on Friday August 13 - the day the Olympic opening ceremony will be broadcast on BBC1 - and Saturday 14, when Match of the Day is due to return after a three year break.</p> <p>But now Bectu has been forced to cancel the proposed industrial action after the BBC threatened to take the union to court, claiming the strike would be in breach of industrial relations law.</p> <p>However, the BBC insisted it had never threatened Bectu with legal action, although a spokeswoman admitted the corporation had been \"consulting with its lawyers\" about the BBC Techonology sell off.</p> <p>Bectu called for the walkout after members in BBC commercial subsidiary BBC Technology - which is being sold off to Siemens - voted in favour of strike action after failing to receive satisfactory guarantees over the maintenance of pension rights and terms of employment.</p> <p>However following the strike vote, the BBC and Siemens last week tabled an improved offer on terms and conditions.</p> <p>BBC lawyers said Bectu had to re-ballot its members on this new offer before going ahead with any strike action - and the corporation threatened to take the union to court if it did not cancel next week's planned industrial action.</p> <p>\"Bectu's own legal advisers recommended that, although members had not yet finished voting on whether or not they were willing to accept the offer, the BBC's threat was serious and the union should therefore drop any plans for a strike beginning on August 13. Even if members have voted to reject the offer by the time the consultative ballot closes on August 12, there will be no strike on the following day,\" the union said.</p> <p>\"However, industrial action could still take place in BBC Technology. Bectu officials are currently drawing up a list of other issues, detailing provisions or benefits currently available to BBC Technology staff, which the union believes should be continued if the Siemens privatisation goes ahead,\" Bectu added.</p> <p>\"The list is planned to be submitted to the BBC at the end of this week - if the corporation refuses to meet the demands, then a further industrial action ballot could be held.\"</p> <p>A BBC spokeswoman said the Siemens deal was on track to be completed in the autumn.</p> <p>\"The BBC has not, at any time, threatened Bectu with legal action. Obviously the BBC has been consulting with its lawyers through this process as it is a major commercial deal and the BBC would want to protect its interests during this period,\" she added.</p> <p>\"Following ongoing negotiations with Bectu, Siemens has now offered significant commitments, guarantees and protections, which we believe address the issues the union has raised,\" the spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Bectu also called off strike action planned for last week after taking legal advice that it could be in breach of trade union legislation.</p> <p>The BBC has proposed that the formal transfer of BBC Technology and its 1,400 employees to Siemens should take place on September 1. </p> <p>However, it seems likely that this handover date will be missed, as the BBC Technology sell-off needs to be approved by culture secretary Tessa Jowell, who will not be looking at the sale until she returns from holiday on September 6. </p> <p>Electronics giant Siemens won out against eight other initial bidders to secure the BBC Technology deal earlier this month. It means that Siemens will provide all of the BBC's IT support and network needs for at least the next decade, in a deal worth \u00a32bn over that period. </p> <p>The corporation's management insists the BBC Technology sale is necessary to cut costs, but Bectu opposes the sell-off, claiming it is short sighted.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>Oil prices today hit yet another 21-year high despite the stated willingness of Opec to boost production.</p> <p>In an already unsettled market, prices rose on news of a fire at a refinery in the US, with the price of a barrel of crude in New York pushing up 32 cents to $44.73 (\u00a324.54) after yesterday's record closing price of $44.41.</p> <p>In London, the cost of a barrel of Brent crude hit $41.35, the highest level since trading started in 1988. The AA has warned motorists to expect petrol to remain above 80p a litre for the \"foreseeable future\" as a result of recent increases in the price of crude. </p> <p>Although the fire, which closed a unit of BP's plant in Texas, was quickly extinguished, analysts said it was enough to send oil prices rocketing, at least in the short-term. </p> <p>\"There is not a great deal of spare capacity so when things like this happen it reminds people of the fragile state of the whole edifice at the moment. It creates a bit of nervousness and pushes the price higher,\" said Richard Slape, oil analyst at stockbroker Seymour Pierce.</p> <p>Oil prices have risen more than 30% this year as strong demand, especially in the US and China, leaves little tolerance for any supply disruption. Consumption is accelerating at the fastest pace in more than 20 years. Fears of terrorist attacks, disruptions to Iraqi exports, and the standoff at Russia's largest oil producer, Yukos, have all contributed to market jitters, while speculation has also played a part in higher prices.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of speculation. Hedge funds are still buying, expecting prices to go even higher,\" Victor Shum, an analyst with Texas-based energy consultants Pervin &amp; Gertz in Singapore, told the Associated Press.</p> <p>The president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) today changed tack after comments earlier this week that the cartel could not immediately boost production. </p> <p>\"We are ready to add another 1.5m barrels a day but will discuss it first during the next meeting in Vienna [in Spetember],\" Purnomo Yusgiantoro - who is also the Indonesian oil minister - told reporters in Jakarta. </p> <p>Mr Purnomo's reassurances, however, left analysts unimpressed. </p> <p>\"Capacity is tight, even though Opec says they can raise production by up to 1.5m barrels a day. But that, too, is not immediate,\" Mr Shum said.</p> <p>Opec, which controls half of the world's crude exports, is pumping at its highest levels since 1979 as it tries to keep prices from shooting up. Opec's current output is 30m barrels a day and only Saudi Arabia, the world's top exporter, has any significant spare capacity to increase supply. </p> <p>Opec lifted its official output limits by 500,000 barrels a day to 26m at the beginning of August. The limits exclude Iraq, which is struggling to rebuild its oil industry after the war and a spate of sabotage attacks on key pipelines earlier this year.</p> <p>Analysts worry that security and terror concerns in Opec member countries Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Nigeria could impede the cartel's plans.</p>",
  "Ken Sprague, who has died of a stroke aged 77, once said that his aim was \"to build a picture road to socialism, to the Golden City or, as Blake called it, Jerusalem\". A painter, sculptor, muralist, banner-maker and sometime television presenter, he was, for half a century, a regular, if dissenting, cartoonist for the Daily Worker, its successor, the Morning Star, and for papers like Tribune and Peace News. <p>As a posterman, his work included material for Martin Luther King Jr and the Greenham Common women - and against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslavakia and Edward Heath's industrial relations bill. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he designed scenery for the Unity Theatre, and was involved in the Centre 42 trade union arts project. </p> <p>Ken's linocuts for the radical collective Cinema Action's Kill The Bill film (1971) began an involvement in filmmaking. I made a film about him in 1972, which led to Jeff Perks's 1976 BBC Omnibus documentary The Posterman. This led to a series of Channel 4 films, devised with Perks and presented by Ken, called Everyone A Special Kind Of Artist (1986). There was also a BBC South-West series, The Moving Line, with Joan Bakewell. In later life, he taught and practised as a psychodrama specialist. </p> <p>Ken was born in Bournemouth, the son of a train driver and a mother who worked in a cardboard box factory. His own first work of art, in 1937, was a linocut made from linoleum torn from the kitchen floor in response to the Spanish civil war. </p> <p>He was educated at Alma Road elementary school and Porchester Road secondary modern school, where the perceptive headmaster recommended he apply to art college. Ken duly won a scholarship to Bournemouth Municipal College and, from the age of 13, studied graphics - in those days, students of his background were hardly considered for fine arts courses. </p> <p>In 1944, aged 17, he volunteered for the Royal Marines, and the same day joined the Communist party. After basic military training, he was transferred to Vickers-Supermarine as a technical artist, work that took him to wartime Yugoslavia. </p> <p>After the war, and a summer stint in a circus, Ken completed his design and illustration course. The Communist party, he told me, was his university, but after the Bournemouth Daily Echo had labelled him a college revolutionary, local job prospects dwindled. He briefly worked for a volunteer labour battalion in Yugoslavia, was employed by the Boy Scouts and then, from 1950 to 1954, worked in a Carlisle mining company design office - doubling as a cartoonist for the local Conservative and Liberal newspapers. </p> <p>Then came a move to London as the Daily Worker's publicity manager, which also had him working as a journalist and cartoonist. Devastated by the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary, in 1959 Ken left to set up, with Ray Barnard, the publicity company Mountain &amp; Molehill. Yet he continued producing cartoons for the Worker, and later the Morning Star, into the 21st century. </p> <p>M&amp;M - later the Working Arts - was responsible for some of the most innovative trade union campaigns of the 1960s and 1970s. Ken told union leaders they had to use publicity to win hearts and minds, and to see it as an integral part of union work. And it was Ken and Barnard who initiated the sensational 1961 visit to Britain of the first man in space, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. M&amp;M also worked for the Indian high commission - which led to a meeting with Jawaharlarl Nehru. </p> <p>In the late 1960s, Ken began editing the Transport and General Workers' Union's the Record, transforming it into a lively newspaper, illustrated with his own cartoons. As a poster and printmaker, he worked with a number of leading progressive organ-isations and individuals, including Pete Seeger. </p> <p>In 1971, he moved with his wife Sheila, a talented potter, to Holwell, a farmhouse in Devon, and converted it into an artistic centre. Sheila died of cancer in 1973, but with his second wife, Marcia, Ken set up the Holwell International Centre For Psychodrama and Sociodrama, which continued until 1998. There Ken combined his artistic talents with pedagogic expertise, using them in this new field, in which he became a leading practitioner. </p> <p>It is his posters and prints that will remain his true epitaph. His innovative and prolific creativity, his recalcitrant questioning, determination and belief in others' potential was a beacon for everyone who met him. His images unsettle, provoke, discomfort but also amuse. </p> <p>Ken was concerned about how politics impacted on the ordinary person. In essence, the leitmotif of his work was about power and the abuse of power, as well as the resilience of ordinary people. He depicted the world as changeable. His work is imbued with unfashionable optimism, depicting a world where ethics and values still have relevance - the antithesis of postmodern fragmentation and its disdain of value systems. </p> <p>Every morning, he drew a political cartoon to assuage his anger and frustration at the state of the world. Only a few weeks before he died, he was excitedly telling me about plans for an artistic project in Cuba and a book he was determined to publish of anti-war drawings. </p> <p>He left the Communist party after the acrimonious split in 1988, insisting that \"the party left me, I didn't leave the party\". He won several prestigious awards, including poster of the year award from the National Council of Industrial Design on two occasions. </p> <p>He is survived by Marcia, from whom he recently separated, and his five children. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ken Sprague, artist, born January 1 1927; died July 25 2004</p>",
  "Nearly 1,900 drunken troublemakers have been handed on-the-spot fines as a result of the first half of the government's two-month summer crackdown on binge drinking, the Home Office said yesterday. <p>Police have also carried out sting operations against 646 off licences, bars and clubs for selling alcohol to underage teenagers, and have confiscated alcohol from more than 4,000 adults and juveniles in \"designated areas\". </p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, said the figures showed that the coordinated police blitz was delivering results in tackling underage and binge drinking. </p> <p>Home Office figures show police visited 14,150 licensed premises during the first four weeks of the campaign and 5% of them were found to have committed an offence, including selling alcohol to under-18s. The stings, which used teenagers of 13 and 14 to attempt to buy alcoholic drinks, found 51% of the pubs that were targeted and 29% of the off licenses were prepared to sell drink to children. </p> <p>The 1,869 fixed penalty notices issued by police during the blitz included 794 for harassment, 786 for being drunk and disorderly, and 289 for other offences. </p> <p>The British Beer and Pub Association's spokesman, Mark Hastings, said: \"We fully support the Home Office enforcement campaign. However, the overwhelming evidence is that the vast majority of the 60,000 pubs in the UK are law-abiding businesses.\" Alan Travis</p>",
  "The \"breadth and depth of discontent\" over the mandatory life sentence for murder means the law needs its first big overhaul in more than 50 years, the government's law reform advisers say today. <p>The Law Commission say 21 judges canvassed during their consultation exercise believe a mandatory life sentence in every case is \"indefensible and should cease\".</p> <p>Judge Alan Wilkie, a member of the Law Commission, said he would urge David Blunkett, the home secretary, to allow the first big review of the law on murder since the royal commission on capital punishment sat between 1949 and 1953.</p> <p>The snapshot review of the current defences to murder also rejects scrapping the defence of provocation.</p> <p>This move had been championed by Harriet Harman, the solicitor general, and she had been hoping for the commission's endorsement so the changes could be included in the domestic violence bill now going through parliament.</p> <p>The Law Commission also rejects the idea of a \"Tony Martin defence\" to allow a defendant to claim they acted in self-defence, despite using excessive force.</p> <p>The suggestion arose after the case of the Norfolk farmer who shot and killed Fred Barras, a 16-year-old burglar, in August 1999.</p> <p>But the government's law reform advisers do say it is time to reform the mandatory life sentence for murder.</p> <p>\"The present law on murder in England and Wales is a mess,\" the 111-page report says.</p> <p>\"A logical system would identify the most serious forms of killing and call them murder, but it might also attempt to identify other forms and grade them for sentencing.\"</p> <p>A commission spokeswoman said: \"The information we have had from those we have consulted indicates widespread dissatisfaction with the law from judges downwards, who feel their work is being made more difficult by the current law.\"</p> <p>The report says it is wrong to put all types of murder, from serial to mercy killings, into one category.</p> <p>The law dealing with provocation was now \"effectively ignored and scarcely anyone has a good word to say for it\", the report adds, saying most people responded to questions about the law on provocation by saying there was a pressing need for a complete overhaul of the law on murder.</p> <p>\"The notion that all murders _ represent instances of a uniquely heinous offence for which a single uniquely severe penalty is justified does not reflect the views of a cross-section of the public when asked to reflect on particular cases,\" the report says.</p> <p>Lady Scotland, a Home Office minister, said the government would not rush into any immediate changes to the law on provocation.</p> <p>\"As their report has demonstrated this is a highly complex area of law,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We would be foolish to rush into quick changes before looking at the analysis and recommendations in the final report very carefully.\"</p>",
  "A judge yesterday told Britain's youngest armed robber, aged 12, who attempted to steal sweets and cigarettes bearing a sawn-off shotgun, that he could be facing a custodial sentence. <p>The schoolboy, who turned 13 last week but cannot be named because of his age, burst into a greengrocers in West Bromwich in May wearing a scarf around his face, a hood over his head and aiming a double-barrelled shotgun at the shopkeeper.</p> <p>He threw a plastic bag towards the owner, Jasbir Singh Guliani, demanding it be filled with money and cigarettes, Wolverhampton crown court was told. Twenty minutes of CCTV footage revealed the boy threatening Mr Guliani who kept him talking while his son phoned the police.

  "One word comes to mind at news that more British men are shelling out for designer clothes: Burton. <p>And here are a few more: Austin Reed, Moss Bros and Ciro Citterio. Doubtless some quote-coining, zeitgeist-surfing commentator will claim that this report proves the existence of that mythical creature, the \"metrosexual\", pausing briefly to jaw on about \"the Jude Law effect\" and so forth, but the truth is a bit more prosaic: when it comes to men's clothes, the high street is simply rubbish. </p> <p>Shiny suits, clunky shoes, ugly denim - the litany is tediously familiar. Whereas women's high street clothing has improved dramatically in the past five years, men linger in the polyester doldrums. </p> <p>But that doesn't explain men's sudden willingness to spend more on clothes and look beyond the confines of Austin Reed's front window. </p> <p>Some have suggested the influence of well-groomed male celebrities. Perhaps, although I have yet to meet a man who has been inspired to go shopping because he saw Tom Hanks, say, wearing a nice suit at the Oscars. </p> <p>Moreover, fashion companies tend to use the big money for A-list female celebrities. The men are a bit further down the celebrity alphabet, paid for with what little is left. Miu Miu's autumn/winter campaign features Maggie Gyllenhaal and, ahem, Jamie Bell. </p> <p>Even designers, it seems, think men are less susceptible to the power of celebrity than women. Instead, women (the non-celebrity versions) are probably better motivators. Now that more women are looking smarter, and are much more clued-up about fashion thanks to greater media coverage, designer diffusion labels and the high-street designer copies, men are smartening up in kind. But whereas women can go to Topshop for their Marc Jacobs-inspired outfit, men actually have to go to Marc Jacobs. </p> <p>But things are improving. Both Topman and New Look are beginning to focus on menswear, and designer diffusion (ie cheaper) labels are both increasing and improving, notably Marc by Marc Jacobs. But the situation is still very much in women's favour.

  "<p>Sitting in fringe theatres on sticky summer nights can be pretty purgatorial. But this American double-bill about New York's seedy sub-culture justifies the discomfort as it teaches us a vital lesson: we no longer expect drama to offer neat resolutions. </p> <p>Mike Batistick's Ponies (2003) is set in a Manhattan betting shop and throws together a bumptious Croat, an idealistic Nigerian and an evasive Venezuelan. Batistick confirms Tony Kushner's vision of America as a failed melting pot in that he shows the Zagreb-born Drazen vividly and realistically abusing his fellow immigrants. But the play unravels once Drazen starts to use the US's post 9/11 paranoia as a means of evading charges of stealing the Nigerian's cab. You hear what Batistick is saying but you feel plot has taken over from character. This is a pity since Simon Holmes gives a fine performance as the bustling Croatian chancer. </p> <p>Brett C Leonard's 10-year-old Scotch and Water takes us into an even more archetypal American setting: the bar room. We watch, intrigued, as a group of New Yorkers bicker under the bleary eye of the proprietress, a former dancer. And, far from being fazed when a guy bursts in a with a gun, they recognise him as a fellow loser and welcome him to their club. </p> <p>All this will be familiar to students of The Iceman Cometh. But Leonard captures well the slow descent from morning brightness, with fierce debates over sporting trivia such as the line-up for the 1927 Yankees, into afternoon torpor. Mike Sarne is very convincing as a maudlin, brown-suited boozer and Laura Brook, as the owner, touchingly suggests the pathos of fading beauty. </p> <p>Simon de Deney's production is atmospherically desolate. Instead of ending the play with the hitman's absorption into the group, however, there's a gratuitous plot-twist. It may be the influence of the movies or the result of excess workshopping but, as with Ponies, it mars an otherwise effective puncturing of the American Dream. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until August 29.

  "<p>The scalpels and test tubes are ready. So, too, are the doctors, forensic scientists, DNA experts and anthropologists. Historians, poets, actors, professors of literature and many ordinary Spaniards, meanwhile, await with bated breath. But, 60 years after Spain's most controversial corpse was dumped in a makeshift grave alongside a one-legged teacher and two anarchist bullfighters, a row has broken out over whether to dig up and - once and for all - identify the remains of the poet and playwright Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. </p> <p>Spain's greatest 20th-century playwright - the author of Blood Wedding, The House of Bernarda Alba and Yerma - lies, or is assumed to lie, in a shallow grave at the bottom of a mountain slope in the small town of Alfacar, overlooking his native city of Granada. \"They say he clung to this olive tree as he died,\" explains Juan Caballero, socialist mayor of Alfacar, in the small park that the town has set up around the spot. \"They shot people here every morning at dawn for two months.\" </p> <p>Lorca was brought here on August 18 or 19, 1936, a month after the rightwing military rebellion that marked the opening of the Spanish civil war. His assassins were members of one of future dictator General Franco's death squads, \" la escuadra negra \" or \"black squadron\", who were systematically wiping out suspected leftwingers. The poet was just one of hundreds, if not thousands, dragged from their homes or prison cells and taken to the hills and ravines at the foot of the Sierra de Alfacar to be summarily, and anonymously, executed. Unlike the 2,102 people shot against the walls of Granada's cemetery, no record was kept of those brought here. </p> <p>Lorca had refused to join a political party but publicly supported leftwing causes. His La Barraca student company, which took theatre to far-flung villages and town squares, was inspired by \"Jewish Marxism\", according to his ultra-right Falangist enemies. He had signed manifestos denouncing rightwing dictators in Portugal, Germany and Latin America. Politics, however, may not have been the only reason for his murder. \"I shot him twice in the arse because he was a maric\u00f3n (homosexual),\" one of his killers, a thug called Juan Luis Trescastro, reportedly boasted. </p> <p>The son of a wealthy Granada family - but the brother-in-law of the city's socialist mayor, who was also shot - Lorca thought he would be safe in his home city. But going to a place that he had once described as having \"the worst bourgeoisie in Spain\" was a terrible mistake. Granada soon fell to the rebels. Lorca sought refuge with the Rosales family, who were prominent rightwing intellectuals, but they were not powerful enough to protect him from a local strongman, Ram\u00f3n Ru\u00edz Alonso, or the civil governor, Jos\u00e9 Vald\u00e9s, who were jointly responsible for his arrest and execution. </p> <p>Lorca's violent death, at just 38, made him one of the most famous victims of a civil war that divided the world and, 60 years later, still has the power to divide Spaniards. The attempts to dig him up, opposed by his own nieces and nephews, have helped bring some of those divisions to the fore once more. </p> <p>\"The ghosts of the civil war still float about. There are still hatreds and rancour. Some things have been passed from grandfather, to father, to son. It has not gone into history,\" admits Caballero. </p> <p>The mayor of Alfacar should know. For he is now at the centre of the row over whether the poet's body should be dug up. On the one hand, those already campaigning for a comprehensive exhumation of some 30,000 Franco victims scattered in similar graves around Spain see Lorca's case as a chance to set a precedent. If Lorca can be dug up, they will ask, why not the rest? They are backed by leftwing intellectuals who see, in Lorca, a symbol for the butchery, cultural and human, carried out in the name of Franco's doctrine of \"national Catholicism\". </p> <p>On the other hand, however, lie the poets' six nieces and nephews, members of a wealthy family, some dedicated to heading publicly funded Lorca foundations, who are still seen in Granada as influential. They are backed by conservative intellectuals whose rallying cry is: \"Let Garc\u00eda Lorca rest in peace.\" </p> <p>Ian Gibson, the Dublin-born writer whose detective work finally located Lorca's grave more than 30 years ago, disagrees. He has said that digging up the grave would provide final proof that this is, indeed, where the poet lies, and also show whether Lorca was beaten - or shot in the arse - before his death. </p> <p>The reasons given by the nieces and nephews include worries that exhumation will, deliberately or otherwise, inflame old political hatreds. They have also claimed, more bizarrely, that this may be a real-estate scam designed to build expensive summer homes on the grave site. Unfortunately, they now refuse to discuss the matter. \"They do not wish to say any more,\" said a spokeswoman at the Madrid-based Fundaci\u00f3n Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. </p> <p>In a rare public comment, niece Laura Garc\u00eda Lorca explained to El Pa\u00eds newspaper that digging up the grave would be too \"violent\". \"The things we might learn about Federico from an exhumation are relatively small; little more than the exact spot of the bodies,\" she added. \"I can't see us changing our minds.\" </p> <p>And that might be the end of it, except that Lorca is not alone. In fact, nobody has formally asked for him to be dug up and identified. The request for the grave to be found and the bodies in it identified has come, instead, from the families of the one-legged teacher, Di\u00f3scoro Galindo, and one of the anarchist barandilleros - the secondary figures of the bullfight, whose job is to rush out and sticks darts in the bull's back - buried alongside him. </p> <p>Francisco Galad\u00ed, the 56-year-grandson of one of those barandilleros, does not like going up the hill from his home in Granada to the grave at Alfacar. \"When I go there I feel as though I am treading on my grandfather's grave. I don't like it. It doesn't feel right,\" he explains. </p> <p>\"My grandfather, Francisco, was active against the fascists, and when they rebelled he was one of the first they went looking for. Our family were treated as apestados - pestilential - for years. My father never got a good job, and we had to go to schools run by priests and fascists. I lived under Franco's repression for 40 years. After 70 years, now it is time,\" he says. </p> <p>The Galad\u00ed family has left the work of their cause to a local \"historical memory\" group that is lobbying for all the victims of Franco's death squads to be disinterred. Francisco is indignant that Spain has been paying for the repatriation of the bodies of Blue Division members, the Spanish volunteers who fought for Hitler in Russia, while nothing is done for Franco's victims. </p> <p>\"Gibson said that while there was a single mass grave left, the civil war was not over, and I agree with that,\" he says. \"If one side (of the civil war) can bury their dead with dignity then it is time the other side was able to as well. The family of Garc\u00eda Lorca has to be respected, just as they respect us. But my father did not want his father to be left abandoned.\" </p> <p>At Granada University, a team of experts with experience of identifying people from mass graves around the world is ready to do the job of digging up Lorca's grave. </p> <p>\"The emotion you feel is always the same. You think about how they suffered, about what they felt. It really effects you deeply, the infinite capacity of people to do damage to others,\" explains Professor Miguel Botella, who has worked on mass graves in Chile, Mexico, Bolivia and Venezuela. </p> <p>The Granada University team agrees that, if the Lorca family is opposed, it would be wrong to identify the poet's body, though that does not mean the others should not be disinterred from the site. </p> <p>\"We have been burying people for thousands and thousands of years. It is one of our marks of culture. Only in extreme circumstances are people left without proper burial. This should be looked at from the point of view of human dignity. Politics should be left aside,\" says DNA expert Professor Jos\u00e9 Antonio Lorente, who has already worked on identifying victims from other civil war mass graves. </p> <p>\"We will probably give permission,\" says Caballero, who obviously expects a legal challenge from the Garc\u00eda Lorca family. \"But a judge will end up deciding what must be done.\" </p> <p>Lorca's whereabouts has long been an international cause celebre. HG Wells began the search when, as president of literary club, Pen, he wrote to the authorities in Granada demanding to know what had happened to his \"distinguished colleague\". He was told that nobody knew. The Franco regime continued to deny the full truth - that he was deliberately murdered on official instructions - right up until the 1970s. </p> <p>In the end, some lines from Lorca's Poet in New York eerily predict what has been happening in the 70 years since his premature, violent death. \"They combed the cafes, graveyards and churches for me/pried open casks and cabinets,/destroyed three skeletons ... \" Perhaps, just perhaps, the search will soon be over.</p>",
  "Detectives investigating the murder of a young bride who was found shot dead in her home discovered a shotgun at her house last night, police said today. <p>The body of hairdresser Chanel Taylor, 23, was found by her new husband Lee a week ago in the house they shared in Huthwaite, Nottinghamshire. </p> <p>Her father, Terry Rodgers, who was also living with the couple, disappeared following the shooting and police were today issuing \"wanted\" posters in a desperate bid to trace him.</p> <p>Police said they could not reveal at this stage whether the shotgun found hidden in the house was the murder weapon. </p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Paul Cottee said: \"Following the discovery of Chanel's body on Friday July 30, the house was sealed and an initial firearms search was conducted but came back negative. </p> <p>\"From that point onwards, every inch of every room is subject to a thorough forensic examination. </p> <p>\"The house is a crime scene and rooms must be searched consecutively. </p> <p>\"This is done to ensure we can gather as much forensic evidence as possible so that nothing is missed. </p> <p>\"As the shotgun was not found in a visible position, scenes of crime officers were not alerted to its presence until its precise location was examined yesterday. </p> <p>\"It cannot be confirmed if this was the weapon used to kill Chanel Taylor.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain's leading internet travel company, <a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a>, suffered a mauling at the hands of the City yesterday as its shares plummeted 18%. </p> <p>The online portal, viewed as a barometer of internet businesses, revealed that its pre-tax losses had ballooned by 39% to \u00a316.9m in the three months to June as it absorbed the cost of a series of acquisitions. Lastminute announced that it intended to slash 350 jobs, amounting to 15% of its workforce, and planned to close 10 of its 25 offices in an attempt to get its costs under control. </p> <p>The downbeat news - and Lastminute's shares falling to 107p - sent shockwaves through the market. Nerves were frayed further when the stockbroking firm Cazenove dumped 18m shares on the market, amounting to 5.5% of the company's equity, at a deeply discounted price of 95p. The placing was on behalf of one of the company's largest shareholders, rumoured to be the American fund manager Fidelity International. </p> <p>Lastminute has had a turbulent year. Its high profile co-founder, Martha Lane Fox, quit her full-time role in November and was subsequently seriously injured in a car accident in Morocco. </p> <p>The company's chief executive, Brent Hoberman, yesterday brushed off the share price fall as a short-term panic prompted by one big seller. \"The share price was zero when I started here,\" said Mr Hoberman, who co-founded the company with Miss Lane Fox. \"Every day I run this business, I get more excited about its potential.\" </p> <p>Lastminute's database of registered subscribers has grown by 28% to 9.6m over the last year, of whom 40% are aged between 25 and 34. </p> <p>It made \u00a3268m of sales, with the lion's share coming from entertainment, hotels and restaurants. </p> <p>The company has been on a lengthy shopping spree. It snapped up the car rentals firm Holiday Autos for \u00a340m in March 2003, then paid \u00a355m in shares for a rival business, Online Travel Corporation, in March this year. Last month it bought its German competitor Lastminute.de for \u00a331m. </p> <p>The purchases have pushed down the group's gross profit margin by 2.3% to 17.2% over the last year. They also contributed to large accounting adjustments which disguised a \u00a3200,000 rise in underlying three-month earnings to \u00a34.3m. </p> <p>Mr Hoberman said: \"If you look at the market position Lastminute.com has, we're number one in all the main European markets. Strategically, we're extremely well positioned and we'll see that flow through to the bottom line in the months and years to come.\" However, analysts complained that its earnings were well below expectations. Robin Chhabra of stockbroker Evolution Beeson Gregory said he had anticipated a figure closer to \u00a39m. </p> <p>He added that the company was coming under sustained attack from US-owned travel site Expedia: \"Expedia are spending millions building their market share in the UK. That's putting pressure on Lastminute to maintain its position.\" </p> <p>In a research note, the stockbroking firm Bridgewell described Lastminute's performance as \"weak\" and said it was suffering from \"poor overall consumer demand for travel\". </p> <p>The slump in Lastminute's shares wiped \u00a363m off the company's market value, leaving it languishing at \u00a3360m. The stock is less than a third of the price when Lastminute floated in early 2000 at 380p, in a placing which was widely criticised as hyped and over-priced.</p>",
  "Liberal Democrats at Newcastle city council have been thwarted in their plans to cut councillors' allowances by \u00a3100,000. <p>The ruling group's manifesto commitment to reduce the \u00a3900,000 bill for the metropolitan authority's 78 councillors was scuppered after the local independent remuneration panel vetoed the plan.</p> <p>The radical proposal was put to the panel less than two months after the Liberal Democrats won a landslide victory in the June local election, wresting power after 30 years of Labour control. </p> <p>Newcastle city council's new administration is now a Lib Dem stronghold, with 48 councillors in its ranks to Labour's 30.</p> <p>Under the allowances proposals, councillors would regain their \u00a37,648 basic allowance but special-responsibility allowances for those who take on extra duties would be drastically reduced.</p> <p>The leader would see his allowance drop by more than \u00a313,000, from \u00a328,899 down to \u00a315,296, while special allowances collectively worth \u00a340,000 for the council's 17 vice-chairs of committees would be dropped altogether. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats also proposed axing the post of deputy leader, saving a further \u00a38,851. </p> <p>According to council leader Peter Arnold, the allowances bill was reviewed in an attempt to assuage the public that councillors are not in local politics out of self-interest or for financial advantage.</p> <p>\"It will go down very well with members of the public,\" he said. \"The popular conception of all politicians is that they are in it for what they can get out of the system. If councillors are seen to be cutting the money they receive, it will be a massive move in the right direction.\" </p> <p>But presented with the changes, the independent remuneration panel - which sets councillors' allowances independently of the council chamber -ruled out their implementation.</p> <p>The council in turn has the right to reject or amend the panel's findings. Mr Arnold said the Lib Dem group would go back to the drawing board, after the review panel pointed out scope for other potential savings.</p> <p>Mr Arnold said. \"The independent review panel basically said that they were not prepared to go along with the cuts on special responsibility, but that there were other areas of the system we could look at.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's debatable when I actually became an adult. According to various criteria it probably wasn't until I left home at the rather late age of 22 and bought my own home at the rather early age of 22 - coincidentally, also the year I finally got really friendly with a man. Or it could be when I went into full-time employment - which I would argue was aged seven (Italian parents will insist offspring join the family business) but the tax office would say was when I was 18. Financial independence - another supposed marker for adulthood - has been gained and lost at varying times between the ages of 14, when such things were judged on the ability to fund a chocolate run to the newsagent's, and now, aged 38. </p> <p>Two recent studies, here and in the US, have shown we now become adults much later in life. Adulthood being judged not on the budding of breasts (which these days applies to both sexes) or the ability to vote, but on when one moves away from home, is financially independent, starts a family. In the first half of the 20th century, the University of Pennsylvania found, most men were able to support a family by the time they were 20. These days it's five years later, with parenthood often - and rather sensibly - being put off until they are 30-plus. </p> <p>In the British study, conducted by the Economic and Social Research Council, people born in 1958 and 1970 were compared. Two-thirds of the women born in 1958 had become mothers by the time they were 30, compared with only half the women born in 1970. Not only are we not starting families young but we're not leaving home either. One in six men born in 1970 - twice the number compared with those born in 1958 - have either never left home or have flown back there. </p> <p>This surprises me not at all. We've got it all the wrong way around. We want children to grow up really fast, and as adults we want to be the children we never were. What happened to individual stages to be savoured for what they were? Perhaps technology is to blame. We are so used to fast forwarding to our favourite bit of music or film, and then being able to go back to the beginning, we think we can do this in life, too. </p> <p>It starts horrifyingly young. \"Have you been playing your baby music?\" I was repeatedly asked when pregnant. The answer was always no. Let her enjoy the relative peace and quiet, for those 40 weeks I wanted her to be able to be \"just\" a foetus. Then there are the parents who rush their babies into starting solids unnecessarily - and dangerously - early. Established on such a diet, there is baby yoga to attend, various supposedly brain-stimulating videos to watch, unfamilial languages to be learned. Put those babies to work! </p> <p>So it goes, unremittingly, on: homework, something awful called \"structured play\", after-school activities, until these children \"grow up\" and realise that they don't want to, just yet. For whose benefit is all this rushing? Is it any wonder that when we are supposed to magically turn into adults we think: hang on a minute, I just wannahavvalittlefun? And what better way to have fun - and spite those parents who tried to turn you into mini-adults too early - than to base yourself in the family home, with little responsibility and a laundry service. </p> <p>I say \"we\", but I was fantastically lucky. My parents always let me enjoy each and every stage of my life. I had a clearly defined childhood and adolescence - during which I played and had fun. I barely used my brain for anything remotely serious until I was 18. Because I've spent half my life playing, my memories of playtime are many, and still as fresh as a snowflake. I remember that play was great with a grown up, but sometimes you just wanted them to be there, in the background, while you did your own thing. Hence I don't need to be told how to play with my daughter now, as countless articles have done this week on the back of National Play Day last Wednesday; no more than I need to be told how to mix the perfect Martini - which is what I spent a timely proportion of my 20s learning. Neither do I need feel the need to hijack her playtime for myself - I fully experienced that stage in my own life. </p> <p>The Children's Play Council says a great many parents don't know how to play anymore with their own offspring. They're too competitive, don't let their children take risks, or use their imagination. Adults \"lead\" play too much, they turn it into something structured and organised and, actually, not much fun at all. But is it any wonder? If these adults, as children, were being rushed into the next \"phase\" of life and up, up into adulthood by their parents, what do they remember of playing? </p> <p>Aristotle wrote that \"Men become builders by building and lyre-players by playing the lyre\". And become adults only by fully being a child, first. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:grilse2004-comment@yahoo.co.uk\">Grilse2004-comment@yahoo.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>Shareholders in BSkyB fear the satellite firm's plans to return cash to investors could see the stake held by News Corporation rise above 35% without the media group launching a full takeover bid. </p> <p>Several investors in Sky, which announced its intention to return cash to shareholders this week, said yesterday they would be watching the firm's plans closely to ensure fair play. </p> <p>William Claxton-Smith, the head of corporate governance at Insight Investments, which owns about 1% of Sky, said: \"We want any return of capital to be structured in a way that doesn't lead to the Murdoch stake creeping up.\" </p> <p>Another shareholder, who refused to be named, said: \"We will be watching this very carefully, watching to see the buyback is not conducted in such a way that it leads to a creeping increase in News Corp stock.\" </p> <p>Sky is planning to ask permission to buy back 5% of its shares at its November annual meeting. On Wednesday, it also announced that it was looking at further payouts to shareholders such as a special dividend or further buybacks. </p> <p>Insight is one shareholder that favours special dividends rather than buybacks in firms with large shareholders. </p> <p>Under Takeover Panel rules, any shareholder with more than 30% and less than 50% of a company has to launch a full takeover if it wants to raise its stake. Rule nine of the Takeover Code is designed to stop large shareholders inching above 50% without paying a premium for control. </p> <p>One way around this rule would be to win approval from more than half the non-News Corp shareholders. This so-called \"whitewash\" rule would allow News Corp, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch - who is also chairman of BSkyB - to raise its stake by simply holding on to its shares in a buyback, but only if he had other shareholders' permission. </p> <p>Insiders at News Corp dismissed any suggestion of a creeping takeover yesterday. BSkyB, which announced its plans to buy back up to 5% of its shares a year, has not yet worked out the full details of such a move. </p> <p>After falling 19% on Wednesday, shares in BSkyB rose 3% to 502.5p yesterday. </p> <p>The strategy of increased investment outlined by chief executive James Murdoch found some support from analysts and investors yesterday. However, several said they felt there was a lack of trust in the management which would only be regained once it had delivered on its promises. </p> <p>In a note to investors, Mike Hilton, an analyst at UBS, said the shares \"look oversold\" but that \"near-term sentiment is likely to remain poor\". </p> <p>The reaction of News Corp was typically robust. Murdoch senior has always made it clear to disgruntled minority shareholders that they can sell out if they do not agree with the board's strategy. That message did not change yesterday. </p> <p>\"News Corp is supportive of it. It is the only sensible course to take, subscriber growth is key to the health of the whole platform. Whether the market likes it in the short term or not, it's the only healthy strategy to take at this point,\" said a News Corp source. </p> <p>News Corp insiders added that it was \"pretty clear\" James Murdoch had inherited a business model that was beginning to plateau by the time his predecessor, Tony Ball, resigned in September last year. Wednesday's subscriber figure of 81,000 net additions was a shock but signs of slowing growth were becoming apparent as Mr Ball entered the final year of his tenure. </p> <p>Under its previous chief executive, BSkyB concentrated on signing up premium customers, but that rich vein is well tapped and the group will now try to lure neglected medium-tier customers. </p> <p>Analysts said Mr Murdoch's predecessor should not be blamed for the setback.

  "<p>Britain's biggest motor insurer says it is taking action to protect the public from the menace of uninsured drivers, announcing it will no longer penalise motorists involved in accidents with people driving without cover. </p> <p>Direct Line said it was the first company to make this \"revolutionary\" change. </p> <p>The move comes ahead of the imminent publication of a government-commissioned report into the problem, which is to recommend ways of protecting law-abiding motorists and cracking down on offenders. </p> <p>It is estimated that one in 20 people drives without insurance, and accidents involving motorists without cover cost more than \u00a3500m a year.

  "<p>David and Victoria Beckham's long-term public relations guru and personal confidante, Caroline McAteer, has finally been ousted from her position as the \"Voice of the Beckhams\".</p> <p>A year after the Spice Girls svengali Simon Fuller took over David Beckham's PR with his company, 19 Management, the woman showbusiness reporters refer to as \"the rottweiler\" has lost her grip on the publicity machine behind Britain's hottest celebrity couple.</p> <p>The split comes after a drawn-out off-pitch battle to control the Beckham's media image.</p> <p>Ms McAteer, who spent more than five years as the Beckhams' mouthpiece and friend, remains in touch with the families of both David and Victoria, but she no longer plays a part in the multimillion pound business that the Beckhams have built up.</p> <p>\"Caroline doesn't have a role on [the Beckhams] as a business at all,\" said a spokeswoman for 19 Management.</p> <p>All of the Beckhams' PR is now split three ways between 19 Management, football PR specialist Simon Oliveira, and Julian Henry of Henry's House PR.</p> <p>Victoria's personal and music business publicity is handled at 19, as is any PR for the Beckhams as a couple - such as their moving house to Madrid or stories about their children, Brooklyn and Romeo.</p> <p>Mr Oliveira handles everything David Beckham does - from football to sponsorship deals. Beckham generated more than \u00a39m in advertising and sponsorship fees last year, on top of his earnings at former club Manchester United.</p> <p>Mr Oliveira is employed by Beckham's London-based company, Footwork Productions Ltd, but splits his time between 19 Management's London office and Madrid.</p> <p>Mr Henry acts as an advisor to both 19 Management and Mr Oliveira, with a strategic overview of all of the Beckhams' PR business. </p> <p>And although Ms McAteer has close links with Mr Henry - he is a shareholder in her business, CM Publicity, which operates from the offices of Henry's House - she is no longer involved in the decisions being made about the Beckhams' business.</p> <p>A year ago, Ms McAteer was at the centre of a bitter power struggle between two of Britain's biggest showbusiness agencies over who should represent the celebrity couple.</p> <p>At the time the Beckhams were represented by Ms McAteer, who worked at The Outside Organisation, which also counts Naomi Campbell and Paul McCartney among its star-studded clients.</p> <p>But the Beckhams defected to 19 Management, cashing in on the relationship Victoria had enjoyed with the music PR expert since her days as \"Posh Spice\".</p> <p>As a result Ms McAteer left The Outside Organisation and set up her own company, with herself, Mr Fuller and Mr Henry as shareholders. She continued to handle some of the Beckhams' work at CM Publicity..</p> <p>Then in a surprise move in October, Beckham ditched SFX, the sports marketing company that had masterminded his transition into a global brand name and had arranged his deal to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid.</p> <p>And after some months without a dedicated football PR advisor, Mr Oliveira - a former employee at PR agencies Ketchum and Lynn Franks' Life - was appointed to handle the star's career just before this summer's Euro 2004 football championship in Portugal.</p> <p>The appointment came just after paparazzi shots of the star in his underpants added insult to injury after Rebecca Loos had revealed details of her affair with the footballer in the tabloid press.</p> <p>The affair shattered the hard-won \"family man\" image that Beckham had meticulously built up and ignited thousands of column inches in the world's media speculating about the state of the couple's marriage.</p> <p>At the time of Mr Oliveira's appointment, 19 Management said Ms McAteer would continue to play a part in the overall \"Beckham strategy\". </p> <p>But just weeks later, that position has changed and - Ms McAteer is left to focus on her one major client, the Arsenal's Swedish footballer, Frederik Ljungberg.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>Geoff Thompson's position as FA chairman was last night undermined as the Football Association announced that he would be \"supported\" in his inquiry into the management failures of the governing body by Roger Burden and David Richards, the chairmen of the FA's national and professional game boards respectively. </p> <p>The board's admission of \"deficiencies surrounding management procedures\" demonstrates at least a willingness to acknowledge the obvious, but the failure to attribute blame or responsibility for the shambles of the past three weeks will confirm the view that there is no real appetite for reform in Soho Square. </p> <p>The promotion of two powerful figures to babysit the chairman, meanwhile, is as close to a vote of no confidence as the board could effect without actually proposing a motion to remove the first paid incumbent of the post. </p> <p>Despite the deep-seated dissatisfaction at Thompson's disastrous handling of the fallout from the affairs conducted by Sven-Goran Eriksson and Mark Palios with Faria Alam, who resigned from the FA yesterday, the board concluded that it would do the FA further damage to try to unseat him. </p> <p>Under FA rules the chairman can only be removed by a meeting of the full council of 92 members and, with the next meeting scheduled for October, the 12-member panel reasoned that the organisation should be spared eight weeks of rows and speculation over his chances of survival. </p> <p>Richards' role will provide the professional game with a further foothold in the administration of the governing body. As the chairman of the Premier League he is a hugely powerful figure and his elevation is a sign that, with the FA having demonstrated it is barely fit to organise a friendly in recent weeks, the professional game is set to assume greater control. In its statement the board made it clear that the Premier League and the Football League would have input into the inquiry. It also announced that it was beginning the search for a new chief executive. </p> <p>Even before yesterday's meeting, pressure was building in the game for the creation of a slimmed-down management board under an executive chairman, with Sir Trevor Brooking considered an ideal \"unity candidate\". </p> <p>Richards' elevation is not necessarily good news for Eriksson. He is known to oppose the Swede's \u00a34m-a-year salary, and should England's qualifying World Cup games against Austria and Poland next month deliver fewer than four points the Swede might be under renewed pressure. </p> <p>The Swede and his advisers will also have noted the qualified nature of the board's decision. The statement said he had been cleared only after legal advice had been taken, indicating the report compiled by the solicitor Peter Norbury did not deliver a categorical not guilty verdict. If Eriksson was concerned he did not show it when contacted by his agent Athole Still after the board's verdict. </p> <p>\"I called Sven after hearing the news and he was going out for dinner with Tord Grip,\" said Still. \"He just said 'Good', with a nice chuckle. He is obviously very pleased and relieved. He is looking forward to carrying on with his job.\" </p> <p>Norbury addressed the meeting for two hours before leaving by a back door to avoid the media scrum outside the Leonard Hotel in central London. Norbury took the board through his report, which includes testimony from Alam, Eriksson and the FA executive director David Davies. </p> <p>The key passages centred on the conversation between Davies and Eriksson on July 19 in which the coach was asked about allegations that an affair took place. Eriksson is thought to have said, \"This is nonsense,\" a phrase sufficiently vague to ensure that at least part of the meeting was dominated by semantics. </p> <p>Davies was not mentioned in last night's statement, raising questions about his future. Yesterday he was said to be relaxed about his prospects and was expecting to be at Soho Square this morning. </p> <p>Speaking before last night's decisions, Roger Draper, the chief executive of Sport England, who has great experience of reforming governing bodies, said the game was ripe for reform. \"I always tell governing bodies that if they can't explain how their sport is run in 30 seconds then it is too complicated. </p> <p>\"The key thing for any sport is to make sure they are all pulling in the same direction. The fact we have so many bodies indicates that people are not always doing that.\" </p> <p> <strong> The findings</strong> </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong>In the case of Sven-Goran Eriksson the board decided on the basis of the report and on legal advice that there is no case for him to answer. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>In the case of Faria Alam, an employee without executive status within the FA, the board have decided it is not appropriate to make any public statement with regard to her role in this inquiry. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>The FA announce they have accepted Colin Gibson's resignation. The FA wish to thank him for his services during his time as director of communications.</p>",
  "<p>Sven-Goran Eriksson was last night cleared of any wrongdoing in the crisis gripping the Football Association and will continue, for the time being at least, as England coach. </p> <p>After almost seven hours of talks at a central London hotel the FA board, led by chairman Geoff Thompson, decided that Mr Eriksson had no case to answer after an inquiry into how the organisation came to erroneously deny that the Swede had an affair with secretary Faria Alam. </p> <p>Mr Eriksson was said by an associate to be \"very pleased and relieved\" to have been cleared. Ms Alam last night resigned, but the blow of losing her \u00a330,000 a year job was softened by the announcement of a \u00a3500,000 deal to sell her story. </p> <p>The resignation of Colin Gibson, the FA's communications director who was exposed as having offered details of Eriksson's private life to the News of the World in exchange for her affair with Mark Palios, the chief executive, being kept secret, was also accepted. Mr Palios resigned on Sunday. </p> <p>The FA's statement stopped short of offering the coach a vote of confidence, an indication of opposition among board members to Mr Eriksson remaining in his post. </p> <p>Having taken legal advice however, the board, a majority of whom are dissatisfied with the coach's performance, was left with no choice but to clear him. \"Throughout the inquiry the board has been determined to address the facts,\" the FA said. \"At all times we have been mindful of the need to follow standard procedures and employment law. In the case of Sven-Goran Eriksson the board decided that on the basis of the report and on legal advice that there is no case to answer. </p> <p>\"This entire episode has been regrettable for the reputation of football in this country but the board remain determined to restore the highest standards.\" </p> <p>The FA also announced a review of its management structure in the wake of the events of the last three weeks. Mr Thompson has survived despite his disastrous handling of the affair, which saw him clear Mr Palios five days before he accepted his resignation. But his influence will be severely curtailed by the appointment of two board members, David Richards, chairman of the Premier League, and Roger Burden, of the Gloucestershire FA, to \"assist\" him. </p> <p>Mr Eriksson may now be certain of selecting the team for England's next game, a friendly against Ukraine at St James' Park on August 18, but the weekend promises to see further embarrassing revelations. </p> <p>Publicist Max Clifford announced yesterday that Ms Alam has sold her story to two Sunday tabloids and ITV: \"She just feels that she couldn't possibly go back to her job. She is obviously not happy about how she has been treated.\"</p>",
  "The security alerts in the US and the UK have also reverberated in South Africa because Pakistani police have raised the possibility that al-Qaida supporters were planning terrorist attacks in Pretoria and Johannesburg. <p>Two South Africans of Asian descent were arrested during the 12-hour gun battle with Pakistani police in the eastern city of Gujrat that led to the capture of Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian wanted for the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. </p> <p>Gujrat's police chief, Raja Munawar Hussainl, alleged yesterday that the two South Africans - Zoubair Ismail, 20, an Islamic student, and Feroze Ganchi, 30, a doctor - were \"plotting attacks in their home country\". </p> <p>\"Authorities found several maps of South African cities among the items seized in the raid,\" he claimed. </p> <p>He told the Associated Press in Pakistan that the two were part of an al-Qaida cell. \"They were very well-trained terrorists because of the way they fought during the gun battle and the way they engaged us for 12 hours,\" he claimed. </p> <p>From maps and blueprints found with the two men, the Pakistani police say they believe there were several targets for attack in South Africa, including the US embassy, the Sheraton hotel and the government Union Buildings in Pretoria, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the V&amp;A waterfront shopping centre in Cape Town and the Cunard liner the QE2, which stops at Cape Town and Durban. </p> <p>As well as the two South Africans arrested in Pakistan, two other South Africans have been arrested in the United States and Mexico in recent weeks, allegedly for travelling on false passports. </p> <p>South African officials have tried to calm public fears, discounting the claims of the Pakistani authorities and assuring the public they are on top of all security threats. A government spokesman, Joel Netshitenzhe, said the reports had little \"credible evidence\". </p> <p>South African officials said they were trying to see the two to make sure they were being being held according to the Geneva conventions. </p> <p>Family members of the two men said they had travelled to Pakistan to go on a hiking trip, and dismissed the reports of them being involved in a terror plot as \"ridiculous\".

  "The employers' chief negotiator in the fire dispute, Christina Jebb, claimed she was sacked last night after she accused her colleagues of not wanting to strike a deal to settle the long-running dispute. <p>The threat of a new FBU strike next month has already forced the Ministry of Defence to draft in a hard-pressed military to drive fire engines. </p> <p>Christina Jebb, chair of the National Fire Employers and a Liberal Democrat member of Staffordshire county council, claimed that the government had a wider agenda to either nationalise or regionalise fire authorities, so that local councils lose control. </p> <p>She said she had been sacked for telling the truth, including a BBC World at One interview at which she had revealed she had voted to accept a provisional deal at a Local Government Association meeting on Monday. She insisted that they did not want a settlement: \"It is totally irresponsible because there was a deal ready to be agreed on the table,\" she told BBC News 24. </p> <p>Ms Jebb claimed the meeting had been packed by political figures inside the LGA. She claimed many of them were not up to speed with the negotiations. </p> <p>The LGA denied her claims, saying she had failed to reflect the views of the employers' representatives and had \"stood down\". She had lost the confidence of her colleagues, including those from all four political parties. </p> <p>The FBU said the LGA's handling of the issue was creating a growing revolt from fire authorities. More than 20 authorities in England - more than enough to force a meeting - have called for a crisis meeting of the LGA's fire forum, which is made up of the chairs of fire authorities and chief fire officers, in the aftermath of Monday's talks. </p> <p>The FBU claimed: \"Nine out of the 13 councillors who voted against the deal were unknown to many of the fire service negotiators. Several of them had been drafted in from London, most of them Labour. The LGA is reaping the whirlwind of the decision to block the deal and the methods used. There is clearly a growing backlash.\" </p> <p>The chaos makes it more likely that members of the FBU will next week vote to support a strike in a ballot. The employers insisted the only remaining issue between them and union leaders was the status of bank holidays. </p> <p>Firefighters would have received a 3.5% pay rise outstanding since last November and a second 4.2% rise, which was due to be enforced on July 1 dependent on changes to modernise the service. </p> <p>The LGA remains adamant that the final part of stage two of the pay deal agreed for fire fighters - a 3.5% pay rise backdated to November 2003 - will be signed off as soon as the FBU agree that public holidays should be treated as normal working days. </p> <p>\"Firefighters receive double-time pay and a day off in lieu for every public holiday worked and the LGA's position states that it is reasonable to therefore expect firefighters to work normally on such days.\" </p> <p>The government confirmed that the armed forces will begin training in preparation for industrial action by firefighters, which could start as early as September 7.</p>",
  "It seems from the comments of Manchester's chief constable Mike Todd (Analysis, August 5) that one clear objective of the terrorist legislation, or how it is being used, is deterrence. He justifies the number of arrests - despite them not leading to convictions for terrorist offences - as necessary to show that people will be stopped and to deter the would-be terrorist. <p>The police are content to arrest many people, even if it only results in a minute number of convictions. This belief leads to lazy policing, as the police will not check or verify their intelligence information, and in some cases they will arrest without specific intelligence, but mere association. </p> <p>People being arrested and released without charge does not add to any deterrence.

  "Fierce clashes between supporters of the militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and US and Iraqi forces in the key city of Najaf yesterday have threatened to trigger a renewed uprising across southern Iraq. <p>The fragile peace that has held in the holy city since June was shattered by deadly fighting that began late on Wednesday and continued well into yesterday evening. </p> <p>It was the heaviest seen in Najaf since Mr Sadr instigated an armed uprising among his supporters in April and May. </p> <p>At least two people were reported killed and eight wounded in yesterday's battle. A further person was also killed and four wounded when a mortar round hit a hospital. </p> <p>Mr Sadr's loyalists claimed to have shot down two US helicopters during the clashes, killing the pilots on board. But US military officials said that only one helicopter had been brought down, and that the pilots had only been injured. They said one American soldier was killed and five were wounded when insurgents attacked a US convoy with a rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire on the outskirts of the city. </p> <p>Later, Mr Sadr's camp called for the truce to be restored. The cleric \"announced that we are committed to the truce and that [US] forces must honour the truce,\" Sheikh Mahmoud al-Sudani told the Associated Press, adding that if not, the violence would continue. </p> <p>There were conflicting accounts of what sparked the violence, as each side blamed the other for violating a June ceasefire. But it followed days of mounting tension during which Mr Sadr's supporters had seized 18 Iraqi police officers in response to the arrest of several of the cleric's senior aides. </p> <p>The US military said fighting began late on Wednesday when a police station was attacked by \"a significant number of aggressors\". The statement said the attackers used heavy machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and small arms in an assault on the police station around 3am. </p> <p>Iraqi national guardsmen quickly reinforced Iraqi police, and the two units successfully defended the station from the attackers. Upon the arrival of the marines, the militia fighters withdrew into the city's exclusion zone, the military said. But aides to Mr Sadr countered that Iraqi police and US forces had fired first. </p> <p>\"The situation right now is really unstable. The forces of the US marines, along with the new Iraqi army are trying to break into the old city,\" Sheikh Ahmed al-Shaybani, a spokesman for Mr Sadr, told the Guardian last night by telephone from Najaf. \"They tried since midnight yesterday till now, using all kinds of weapons like F-16 jet fighters and Apache helicopters.\" </p> <p>The crackle of gunfire could be heard in the background as he spoke. \"We hold the governor of Najaf [the US-appointed Adnan al-Zurfi] responsible for the violation because he called in the Americans and he wants to enter the old city and eliminate the Al Mahdi army.\" </p> <p>Under the June peace deal, US troops said they would not enter parts of Najaf close to the shrine of the Imam Ali, one of the holiest sites in the Shia faith. </p> <p>Many Iraqi Shia were outraged when the golden-domed shrine was twice damaged during fighting between US forces and Mr Sadr's fighters in May. Since then the Mahdi guerrillas have controlled access to the sacred site, which in more peaceful times attracts millions of foreign pilgrims. </p> <p>Yesterday in Najaf, loudspeakers at the shrine called on \"all elements\" of the Mahdi army in Iraq to mobilise for \"jihad against the infidel American forces\". </p> <p>There were reports of new clashes between American troops and Mr Sadr's supporters in the Sadr City district of Baghdad, one of the militant cleric's main power bases. </p> <p>Sheikh Shaybani said the Mahdi forces had taken \"complete control of Najaf\", as well as the governor's buildings in Kut, Amara, Basra, and Diwaniya. </p> <p>His claims could not be verified, but a Guardian reporter in Basra said the building there appeared peaceful and there were no signs of an occupation. </p> <p>The prospect of a renewed uprising among Mr Sadr's supporters will add to the pressure on Iraq's interim government to show it can deliver what many Iraqis say is their top priority - security. </p> <p>It is already struggling to cope with the almost routine bombings and kidnappings that occur largely in Sunni Arab areas. </p> <p>Yesterday saw another Iraqi police station targeted by a suicide bomber. Six people died and more than 24 were wounded in the town of Mahawil, south of Baghdad, when insurgents detonated a car bomb and sprayed gunfire at the police station. </p> <p>Sabah Kadhim, an interior ministry spokesman, said two senior police officers were also shot dead in the town of Musayyib, near Mahawil. </p>",
  "British troops shot dead two men loyal to the rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr yesterday in a 15-minute gun battle in the southern city of Basra. <p>The incident came amid rising tension between UK forces and the cleric's militias. </p> <p>Yesterday's confrontation took place in a northern suburb. \"Coalition forces were attacked with small arms fire and returned fire, killing two enemy fighters,\" a British military spokeswoman said. There were no British casualties. </p> <p>Following the incident, Mr Sadr's clerics in Basra told their followers to prepare for a violent campaign of protest. </p> <p>At least 200 armed men gathered at the cleric's main office in Basra. One cleric, Sheikh Assad al-Basri, told the Associated Press that the group had \"prepared 1,000 fighters in Basra to confront the British forces who failed to respond to our demands\". </p> <p>The incident came three days after the British arrested four of Mr Sadr's followers. The group had apparently expected the men to be freed yesterday, but they were still being held for questioning. </p> <p>Mr Sadr has shown his ability in the past to muster large numbers of fighters across the province quickly. In April his gunmen seized control of the governorate on the canal bank in central Basra and fought against British soldiers. Last night, there was a heavy police presence in Basra but, despite earlier fighting, much of the city appeared calm. </p> <p>In a separate incident, British soldier Private Christopher Gordon Rayment died in an accident in Amara yesterday.</p>",
  "A significant contributing factor to Tuesday's flash floods in London is the concreting over of front gardens for car parking.

  "Labour and the Tories are fighting over the law and order baton in the race for government. But both parties are committed to a regime that arguably causes more crime than any other single policy. In the 2004 comprehensive spending review last month, Gordon Brown earmarked just under \u00a315bn to run the Home Office in 2007-08, up more than \u00a34bn on 2002-03 but a billion less than the \u00a316bn that the government estimates to be the annual cost of drug-related crime. Could it be that some of this expenditure is actually creating this crime? Is there a policy elephant that has hidden itself where no one can see it? <p>Transform estimates that drug prohibition has cost between \u00a3100bn and \u00a3200bn over the past 20 years. The government estimates that it currently costs \u00a320bn a year. </p> <p>In 1961 the UK signed up to the UN convention on drugs, joining over 150 member states in pledging to criminalise the production, supply and use of a selection of psychoactive substances. This was the definitive moment when global drug prohibition came into being. Ten years later the then home secretary, Jim Callaghan, introduced the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Then there were fewer than 5,000 problematic drug users in the UK. There are now an estimated 280,000, mostly using heroin and/or cocaine. </p> <p>Unfortunately the chancellor does not control the price of opium- or coca-based products. That is left to the unregulated illegal market. As a result of the risk attached to the trade, profit margins exceed that of any other commodity on the planet - 2000% to 3000% between production and use is not unheard of, a gift horse for organised criminals. The knock-on effect of the price hike at street level is to make a daily habit far too much for most people to afford. An average heroin habit starts at \u00a350 a day; a crack binge can run into hundreds. Problematic users on ordinary incomes often resort to crime to support their habit. </p> <p>There are 8 million heavy drinkers in the UK of whom 2 million are very heavy drinkers. The crime costs associated with the misuse of alcohol are \u00a37.3bn a year - most of it violent crime. There is little property crime associated with alcohol use and none committed by the UK's 12 million tobacco users. Our million prescription tranquilliser addicts are not begging on street corners or breaking into houses. A far smaller population of heroin and crack users commit far more crimes, purely because their daily habit is prohibitively expensive. </p> <p>As part of its welcome review of British sex laws the government estimated that 95% of street prostitution is related to crack and heroin use. Most of the women plying their trade by the road do so to get a rock of crack, and will repeat the cycle for 36 hours or so until they crash out, using heroin until the cycle begins again. </p> <p>Lest you think that legal regulation would be a panacea, imagine 12 million heroin addicts instead of tobacco users, a world where crack was aggressively marketed to young people using techniques perfected by the likes of British American Tobacco and alcopops retailers. Haven't we got enough legal drugs on the market to tempt our children? </p> <p>So, let's all pretend that young people are prey to evil pushers, rather than self-determining individuals who, like adults, make some lousy decisions. And if they screw up, let's make sure that, on top of everything else, they have the long arm of the law to deal with. </p> <p>Problematic use is clearly linked to social deprivation and only tackling its root causes will significantly reduce the numbers of new problem users. It is no coincidence that Britain has some of the highest levels of problematic use in Europe and one of the widest gaps between rich and poor. </p> <p>Prohibition is a major cause of theft, is responsible for violent turf wars, contributes to urban degeneration and makes criminals of millions of otherwise law-abiding people. </p> <p>The UK locks up more people than any other western European nation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that somewhere between 30% and 80% of the prison population are property offenders funding a heroin or crack habit. Prohibition also contributes significantly to the destabilisation of most of Latin America, Afghanistan and the Caribbean. </p> <p>So let's treat our way out of this mess: \u00a3573m is earmarked for treatment of our quarter of a million illegal drug users (compared with \u00a3100m for alcohol treatment). This treatment spending is delivered primarily through the criminal justice system: the Criminal Justice Intervention Programme is the newest flagship scheme to reduce offending among problematic users. </p> <p>The effect of prohibition is to force up the price of illegal drugs, causing problematic users to steal and be identified through the courts. They are then - and only then - provided with treatment programmes of highly variable quality. This means that most of our money is spent enforcing the law, the public bears the brunt of the crime costs and the policy appears to be \"tough on crime\". The government is effectively running a harm maximisation policy, implementing a crime reduction policy masquerading as treatment. </p> <p>The reaction to all this from journalists, parliamentarians, NGOs and academics is surprisingly muted. In 2002 the Observer polled a cross-section of adults on a range of drug policy issues: 45% believed that levels of street crime and burglary would be reduced if hard drugs were decriminalised.</p> <p>If nearly half the adult population understands that prohibition creates property crime, why don't policy makers, the press, criminologists and NGOs involved in crime reduction and penal reform? </p> <p>Prohibition will continue so long as its potential critics remain silent. And home secretaries of all political hues will continue to trumpet reductions in crime, while pursuing the policy that doubles it. Next time the crime figures are announced in the news, look carefully - there may be an elephant in the room. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Danny Kushlick is director of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tdpf.org.uk\">www.tdpf.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Having flirted for too long with the notion of handy as opposed to quality all-rounders for the one-day side, the England selectors will take a step in the right direction today when they announce a 14-man squad for the three-match series against India and the Champions Trophy which follows it. </p> <p>Key to their thinking is the return to full fitness of Andy Flintoff, for which, in the face of much criticism during the disappointing NatWest series, they remain grateful. There is resonance here of the 60s group the Dave Clark Five: Bits and Pieces one minute, Glad All Over the next. </p> <p>Flintoff rivals South Africa's Jacques Kallis as the world's leading all-rounder, and his inability to bowl during the one-day triangular tournament this summer, the result of inflammation caused by a bone spur on his left ankle, unbalanced the side as he played as a specialist batsman. </p> <p>In this he was extremely successful, scoring back-to-back centuries - the first he has made at this level - thereby turning an inconvenience into an essential part of his learning curve. However, his pace bowling, just short of a length and lending more control than can be delivered by any of his team-mates, was sorely missed. England were dumped out of their own competition by New Zealand and West Indies. </p> <p>Now Flintoff's return to bowling form - he sent down some tentative overs during the first Test and upped the workload in last week's win at Edgbaston - will allow England to balance the side better, without the need to find fill-in bowlers. The attack may even revert to something near that which is so successful in Test cricket. </p> <p>There should also be an opportunity, now that he has recovered from injury and is backfiring, for Simon Jones to be introduced with an eye on the 2007 World Cup, and he may be included alongside Steve Harmison, James Anderson and, probably for the last time - how often must we say that? - Darren Gough. </p> <p>The continuing presence of Essex's Yorkshireman, though, admirable as he remains, has to be counterproductive even in the short term, when England players need to gain all the experience they can against the best. There is no finer place to start than in a series against Sachin Tendulkar and company, followed by a mini-World Cup. Matthew Hoggard, once regarded as an excellent white-ball bowler, ought to be given the chance in Gough's stead. </p> <p>On the batting front the likeliest new face is the Warwickshire right-hander Ian Bell, 22, who, having been slow coming to the boil, is bubbling merrily this season. Batting is his forte but it will not have escaped attention that he bowls medium pace in much the same way as Mark Butcher, say, but with more scope for development. It all means no place for Rikki Clarke, Anthony McGrath or Ian Blackwell. </p> <p>On Sunday the selectors also name their squad for the third Test against West Indies at Old Trafford beginning on Thursday. With the run of success reaching heroic proportions there is not much chance of change, although Simon Jones will be hoping for a place in the final XI instead of Anderson. Perhaps, too, with the continuing indisposition of Butcher, Bell will be introduced as part of the induction process. Gareth Batty may also be added as insurance against an old-fashioned Trafford turner. </p> <p> <strong> England</strong> (possible squad for NatWest Challenge and Champions Trophy): Vaughan, Trescothick, Strauss, Key, Flintoff, Collingwood, G Jones, Giles, S Jones, Harmison, Anderson, Batty, Bell, Hoggard. </p> <p><strong> India</strong> (for NatWest Challenge and Champions Trophy): Sehwag, Tendulkar, Ganguly (capt), Dravid, Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Kaif, Agarkar, Karthik (wk), Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Balaji, Nehra, Pathan.</p>",
  "Should you have been eavesdropping on a group of British men five years ago you might have overheard an analysis of a football game, a discussion of how much they drank the night before, and then more of the football talk. <p>Cast an ear towards their conversation today and they are more likely to be discussing the merits of Paul Smith, Helmet Lang, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Armani. </p> <p>Yes, research shows that British men are becoming so style-conscious that they have overtaken women in purchases of designer clothes in the past year. </p> <p>And while women are likely to scour the high street for cheaper versions of designer outfits, men will not compromise on quality. </p> <p>In a phone survey, 49% of the men questioned said they had bought designer wear in the past year, compared with 44% of women, according to the market research analysts Mintel. </p> <p>Its consumer analyst, Jenny Catlin, said the results dispelled the myth that British men had no fashion sense and confirmed the rise of the metrosexual-thinking male, who will wear jewellery and may consider watching Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. </p> <p>\"It's definitely true men are becoming more effeminate ... and the gap is narrowing ... there is a general move away from that negative stereotype of men not caring about the way they look and smell,\" she said. </p> <p>And in an area considered the woman's domain - an obsession with breathtakingly expensive shoes - men are just as taken, the report says, more men having bought designer shoes than women in the past year. </p> <p>Fashion designers think it is because high-profile brands are moving into casual wear. </p> <p>The British menswear designer Neil Barrett said: \"There is a knock-down effect from seeing actors and pop groups to sports stars everywhere in men's magazines. </p> <p>\"And there are more men's magazines in Britain than anywhere in the world: the fashions show up in your face all the time, whatever your interest is: sport, music film. </p> <p>'\"British men are a lot more aware about these things now than they were.\" </p> <p>Men's designer wear has grown by 24% in five years and is worth about \u00a3613m compared with \u00a3493m in 1999. </p> <p>Women's designer wear has increased by 14% in the same period and is worth \u00a3862m. </p> <p>The British designer John Richmond said: \"Women have been telling men they look like shit for so long that they finally decided to do something about it, and now women are probably pissed.\" </p> <p>Ms Catlin believes it is due to celebrities making it acceptable for men to take care of the way they look and be interested in stylish clothing. </p> <p>\"We have such a massive interest in celebrities - with celebrity magazines sales completely blowing fashion magazines out of the water,\" she said. \"There's that aspirational feeling which comes with wearing designer clothes, a certain elitism and a cachet they want to achieve. </p> <p>\"Men are aware of that and they are now discussing it.\" </p> <p>But while they are happy to linger in designer clothing outlets men are still unhappy being seen buying personal grooming items. </p> <p>Some have said that being caught in the moisturiser aisle is so excruciatingly uncomfortable that they often leave without buying any and instead use their partners' products. British men fall short of most European men in the amount they spend on grooming. </p> <p>The market analyst Datamonitor says the French male spends \u00a368 a year on personal products, a German man average \u00a350, and the Dutchman about \u00a347, but the British man only \u00a345. </p> <p>Spanish men come last, spending \u00a330 a year on moisturiser, body washes and haircare.</p> <p><b> Ten things to wear this season </b></p> <p><b>1</b> The menswear mantra for the season is \"retro\" which means either 1950s preppiness or 1920s Brideshead. Let's deal with the former first. </p> <p><b> 2</b> Bert and Ernie's striped shirts are a mainstay of this season's preppy look. Sesame Street chic - you heard it here first. </p> <p><b> 3</b> The best shirts are done by Comme des Gar\u00e7ons in their Shirt range, a collaboration with Fred Perry </p> <p><b> 4</b> V-neck cashmere jumpers, like the ones Darren wears on the 1950s sitcom Bewitched, are also recommended </p> <p><b> 5</b> Flat caps are not, so stop this Guy Ritchie/Will Young nonsense and ignore anyone who tells you otherwise </p> <p><b> 6</b> And give your jeans a break.

  "It was the sort of \"I could do that\" moment almost every aspiring writer has experienced. \"In 1994, while vacationing in Tahiti, I found an old copy of Sydney Sheldon's Doomsday Conspiracy on the beach. I read the first page ... and then the next ... and then the next. Several hours later, I finished the book and thought, 'Hey, I can do that.'\" <p>The difference between most aspiring writers and the young man who came across Sydney Sheldon on a tropical beach is that he did do that. The novel he went home to write was Digital Fortress, a techno-conspiracy thriller published to mild acclaim and moderate commercial success in 1996. </p> <p>But it was with the publication of his fourth novel, The Da Vinci Code, that Dan Brown became a publishing phenomenon: the book has sold more hardback copies than a work by any other novelist, including JK Rowling. </p> <p>\"We always acknowledged that we had something exceptional, but I don't think any of us knew how extraordinary it was,\" said Stephen Rubin, president of his publisher, Doubleday. </p> <p>The Da Vinci Code went to number one on the New York Times bestseller list in the first week of its publication in March last year and has not dropped below four. It is currently at the top of the British bestseller lists. More than 15m copies are in print, including an ebook and a special illustrated edition. It is available in 42 languages. </p> <p>At one point all four of Brown's novels were in the NYT bestseller list. The Da Vinci Code has spawned a small publishing industry of its own, producing books in its wake or attempting to stop it in its tracks. At least a dozen rebuttals have been published. </p> <p>The film of the book, to be made by the Oscar-winning director Ron Howard, is due out next year. </p> <p>Part of the success is doubtless down to the marketing strategy. Doubleday sent out 10,000 advance copies to reviewers and booksellers - an unprecedented figure for a little-known writer - which resulted in orders for 230,000 copies. The plan was given a boost when the New York Times jumped the gun and ran a rave review on its front page the day before publication. </p> <p>The fuss is all about a relatively straightforward conspiracy thriller with a veneer of learning, written at breakneck speed, a sort of Umberto Eco-lite. The plot of the 450-page novel can be neatly summarised in 44 words, which Brown himself helpfully does on his website. \"A renowned Harvard symbologist is summoned to the Louvre Museum to examine a series of cryptic symbols relating to Da Vinci's artwork. In decrypting the code, he uncovers the key to one of the greatest mysteries of all time ... and he becomes a hunted man.\" </p> <p>Although Brown must be well on the way to being a very rich man, the success, say friends and colleagues, has not gone to his head. </p> <p>His work takes place near Exeter, in southern New Hampshire, where Brown lives with his wife Blythe in a waterfront home. Brown, 38, was born in Exeter, the son of a maths teacher and a musician. He graduated from the local high school, where his father taught maths, and Amherst College. </p> <p>He moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as a composer, pianist and singer. But his brand of middle-of-the-road pop failed to sell, and he moved on to study art history in Seville, a period which sowed the seed of The Da Vinci Code. </p> <p>In 1993 he returned to New Hampshire and a teaching job at his old school. But his time in Los Angeles, and the misfits he encountered there, inspired him and his wife to write a book, 187 Men to Avoid: A Guide for the Romantically Frustrated Woman. </p> <p>Then in the spring of 1995 the secret service arrived at the school. In an interview published three years later, Brown said the agents \"detained one of our students, claiming he was a threat to national security. As it turned out, the kid had been on the internet the night before ... and had made the comment that he was so mad at the current political situation he was ready to kill President Clinton.\" </p> <p>Brown's interest was aroused and he started to research the National Security Agency, the US eavesdropping equivalent to GCHQ. The result was his first novel, Digital Fortress, steeped in technobabble and conspiracy and laced with a warning about the erosion of privacy. But for Brown, at least before he was famous, the loss of privacy was not altogether a bad thing if it meant a safer country. \"We now have weapons of mass destruction,\" he said in 1998, \"so maybe there is this argument that each one of us needs to be watched by somebody.\" </p> <p>That entanglement with the real world set a pattern repeated in all his books: each reveals some carefully researched and controversial fact about the world around us. His next book, billed as a sequel to The Da Vinci Code, is set in Washington and tackles the Freemasons. </p> <p>His penchant for mixing fact and fiction is laid out at the very start of The Da Vinci Code. It opens with a single page statement titled \"Fact\", which includes the unlikely assertion: \"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\" </p> <p>Whatever its usefulness, it signals that Brown is telling us a story he believes to be true. The Da Vinci Code revolves around a conspiracy to pervert the course of Christianity, and lays much of the blame on the ultra-traditional Catholic group Opus Dei. </p> <p>Brown is relaxed about the controversy and revels in the discussion. \"Controversy and dialogue are healthy for religion as a whole,\" he says on his website. \"Religion has only one true enemy - apathy - and passionate debate is a superb antidote.\" </p> <p>He takes cover from the flak by adopting the \"but I was only asking\" defence. \"We are all trying to decipher life's big mysteries\", he writes, \"and we're each following our own paths of enlightenment. I consider myself a student of many religions. The more I learn, the more questions I have. For me, the spiritual quest will be a life-long work in progress.\" </p> <p>He brings almost the same dedication to his writing. \"He wakes very early in the morning and travels to his office and is working by 4am,\" Mr Rubin said. \"I wouldn't describe him as especially driven. If you met him you wouldn't think he was very driven. He's very focused.\" </p> <p>His agent, Heide Lange, concurs. \"He works every day in a writing loft: there's no phone, no email; he's definitely cocooned. He knows what's going on in the world and he could definitely hold his own in a dinner party conversation, but he spends most of the time in the world of his own books.\" </p> <p>The Da Vinci Code includes a character called Jonas Faukman, the hero's book editor, a barely disguised reference to Brown's long-term editor Jason Kaufman. The hero is Robert Langdon, surely not too far away from John Langdon, the author of Wordplay: Ambigrams and Reflections on the Art of Ambigrams, listed on Brown's website as one of his 10 favourite books. </p> <p>Another notable entry, alongside Shakespeare, Steinbeck and The Elements of Style (\"because who can possibly remember all the rules of grammar and punctuation?\") is Jeffrey Archer's Kane and Abel. \"I was amazed how well Archer handled the long time spans without ever losing the narrative pulse.\" </p> <p>An earlier request from an interviewer for Brown to list his favourite writers brought the disarmingly honest response: \"Ugh! I know I am supposed to list all the great writers who have inspired me. I'm ashamed to say that I am so busy writing I have almost no time to read anything other than non-fiction and research books. On vacations I grab some mainstream thriller off the bestseller rack. Not glamorous, I know, but the truth.\") </p> <p>To Lange, the hero bears more than a passing resemblance to the author. \"I think he embodies Robert Langdon,\" she says. \"He is as smart as the character he has created. He is very engaging and playful. He is mentally invigorating.\"</p> <p><b>Life in short</b><br></p> <p><b> Born </b> 39 years ago in New Hampshire, son of a mathematician father and a musician mother, on a street where the author John Irving used to live </p> <p><b> Education </b> Graduate of Amherst College and Phillips Exeter academy, where he and his father both taught </p> <p><b> Family </b> Lives in Exeter, New Hampshire, with wife Blythe, an art historian and painter who collaborates on his research </p> <p><b> Career </b> After college moved to California to pursue a career as songwriter, pianist, and singer.

  "<p>Barefoot, and with a slightly distracted air, Brian Cox opens his front door to London's hottest day of the year. His hair is dyed rust-brown - an adjustment for Woody Allen's top-secret project, I take it, which he's filming in London at the moment. He wafts me inside. Cox's house, like its owner, is surprisingly small but full of character. A fresh script lies open on the back of a chair. There's a toddler's climbing frame in the garden, and a meditation room down the hall.</p> <p>Cox is 58, but his current schedule would exhaust three teenagers. He's just finished a movie with the Farrelly brothers; last weekend, his film The Bourne Supremacy made a $53m splash at the US box office; his Agamemnon is still battling Brad Pitt's Achilles on screens around the world; he has a two-year-old son, who is currently with his wife in their new home in LA; and another baby is expected in October, by which time the Coxes hope to have moved house. He also works as a drama teacher and theatre actor. And last night he was up until 3am trying to get his computer to work.</p> <p>\"Do you want to get something to eat?\" he asks me, friendly but a little weary. Yes, I say. I was prepared for this. Cox had said in advance that we should go down the pub, so I resolved to line my stomach. \"Matthew!\" he shouts up to an invisible computer-mender somewhere in his souk-cum-rabbit warren of a house. \"I'll be about 45 minutes!\"</p> <p>Cox's celebrity might be the strangest in Hollywood. Not because he doesn't deserve it, but because of how he made his name: with a small role as Dr Hannibal Lecktor in Michael Mann's Manhunter (1986). The movie grossed only $8.6m in the US, but became a retrospective classic five years later when Anthony Hopkins's Dr Lecter unleashed a new bogeyman on the world. How many other screen actors made their name playing a character synonymous with someone else?</p> <p>At the bar, I order first, and ask for a pint. Now it's Cox's turn. \"Can I have a mineral water, please,\" he says, \"with a little apple juice in the bottom?\" He may now have made his mark on Hollywood - but Hollywood, clearly, has also left its mark on him.</p> <p>I ask him why casting agents love him so much. \"They didn't always; and they may not do again. You can't believe all this stuff. You can't go around saying, 'I am Sir Thing. I have now arrived at a status in my life where I am very special and should be treated specially.' That's all horseshit. It's all dust within seconds.\"</p> <p>Cox knows how quickly things can go wrong. He was born in Dundee in 1946 into a poor Irish immigrant family. When his father, a weaver, died of cancer when he was nine, his mother suffered a breakdown from which she never fully recovered. He was thereafter raised by his aunt and sister while his mother languished in an institution, undergoing the horrors of 1950s psychiatric treatment.</p> <p>Cox always wanted to be a movie star, so he left home at 15 to get cracking. He trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts, and found plenty of work in theatre and television, but it was only in the 1990s that his occasional character parts began to coalesce into a film career. \"People always said everything would come later to me, and it was true,\" he says.</p> <p>Has he seen an effect on his fanbase? \"It's got bigger, especially in the past year because of X-Men 2 and Troy. They've only recently begun to put a name to my face, but now they know there's a person behind all those different people. When we went to the premiere of The Bourne Supremacy, I came out and there must have been more than 100 people, which was scary. I was signing and signing and signing, but I couldn't get out, so in the end I just had to say stop.\" He sounds quite weary of the adulation. \"But it's fine, as long as you're gracious. They're funny people, but they're nice people. I don't have stalkers.\"</p> <p>At a time that he describes as the most satisfying of his career, Cox has also started to overcome an old hang-up. \"I've begun to view my own work again. I've finally accepted the fact that I'm getting old - or older - so I can look at myself.\" Why couldn't he look at himself before?</p> <p>\"Remember when you see the Elephant Man, and you're going, oh but his nose ... and his ear ... and his arm ...\" His voice teeters somewhere between pity and horror. \"That's how I feel about myself. I do feel that I'm the Elephant Man when I watch myself on screen. I crawled out of Rob Roy on all fours - and I was wearing a kilt at the time. Funnily enough, I don't mind my own voice, it's just seeing all these bits that stick out, like noses, or big lobes on my ears ... or chins. I come across as a sort of creature; I never seem like a human being. A lot of it's vanity. I much prefer to bathe in my own view of myself, which is not necessarily the physical reality.\"</p> <p>Cox's physical reality is notably short and fairly plump. He is no matinee idol, but no gargoyle either. The word \"craggy\" has followed him everywhere for the past 15 years. And yet, as we talk, he radiates confidence - the kind that takes time to build up.</p> <p>What quickly becomes clear is that all his views fit somewhere into a leftish continuum (he describes himself as a socialist), in which hard work and professionalism are the great heroic virtues. The quantity of his output, coupled with the range of roles he has taken on, testify to this. While specialising in villains (although he dislikes this simplification - \"you have to develop a point of view\"), Cox was equally memorable as Ed Norton's sympathetic father in 25th Hour and as the comic Dr Guggenheim in Rushmore.</p> <p>Cox is in the zone now, emphasising every point with a flourish of his hand, acting out snatches of dialogue where necessary. I ask how the Woody Allen movie is going. \"It's going very fast,\" he says. \"It should be finished quite soon. I'm only doing it really to work with Woody. I love his films.\"</p> <p>And what is Allen like to work with? \"I think he intimidates everybody because he trusts you to do your job; he doesn't give you vast notes. I think he knows what he wants, but he doesn't declare that. Woody will say,\" (at this point he switches on a very passable impression) \"'You know, it would be nice if I could recognise some of my own words, but that's OK.' He's like Clint Eastwood; you're wrapping by one o'clock in the afternoon.\"</p> <p>I ask what his part is like. \"I play the father of the family, who's a kind of upper-class character, which is a bit of a stretch for me.\" And are you bad? \"No, I'm not bad, actually. I'm magnanimous.\" He ponders this for a moment, grumbling something about how we'll probably still find some way to see this role as another bad guy. \"He does buy his son-in-law; I suppose that's the one thing he does do.\" Buy his son-in-law? \"Well I'm not allowed to go into it, but it's an interesting story.\" Having a topic of conversation banned must be a particular strain for someone as garrulous as Cox. \"This film has the same themes as his others, but it's done through a different filter - an English family. It's a moral tale, that much I will say. It's more in the Crimes and Misdemeanors area of his work.\"</p> <p>It is Allen's unshowy approach to showbusiness that Cox has found a love for in the US. \"The thing I like about America is that it's very professional,\" he says. \"I can't say I don't like certain aspects of English life, because I do, but I've always felt like an observer, or a visitor. I think Tony Hopkins has the same thing that I have, only in his case it's more chronic, and I think more painful. I'm not pained by it; I'm more amused by it.\"</p> <p>Back at his house, Cox's computer is nearly fixed. He looks so settled here that it's hard to believe he plans to leave. \"The truth of the matter is I'm not leaving,\" he says, \"I'm just buying a house. I'll be as much here as ever. And I like doing the theatre here, much more than in America.\"</p> <p>Working, bringing up small children and travelling - it must be exhausting? \"It's only exhausting if you're exhausted. It's infinitely more exhausting for my wife than it is for me. And I'm very good at catnapping - I've been like that since I was a wee boy.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Bourne Supremacy is released next Friday</p>",
  "The case of a Saudi diplomat suspected of indecently assaulting a young girl in London has led to calls for the centuries-old conventions of diplomatic immunity to be scrapped or significantly altered. <p>The case in question is a dramatic one: a 41-year-old man may have assaulted an 11-year-old girl but the police have no power to investigate. </p> <p>The Saudi embassy has promised a thorough investigation and a trial for the man in Saudi Arabia if the claims have foundation. This must be little comfort to her parents, as the system puts him out of reach of British justice. </p> <p>The Foreign Office said that in 2002, 21 diplomats out of a community of 20,000 were accused of what it considers serious offences, those which would carry a penalty of 12 months or more in prison. In only two or three of these cases was immunity waived. </p> <p>It is serious offences that have former home office minister Barbara Roche and human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson calling for change.</p> <p>But diplomats have been quick to criticise Ms Roche's stance. The present law on immunity dates from the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/law/ilc/texts/diplomat.htm\">1961 Vienna Convention</a> and has near global support. </p> <p>The idea that all 177 signatory countries would agree to change a system that by and large serves their needs is fantasy, says Malcolm Forster, the joint head of public international law at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. </p> <p>Moreover, it is precisely against serious charges that diplomatic immunity is necessary, diplomats say. An unfriendly regime looking to harass a diplomat is unlikely to accuse him of double parking. </p> <p>Oliver Miles was the ambassador to Libya when WPC Yvonne Fletcher was shot dead by a gunman from within the Libyan embassy in London in April 1984. </p> <p>What appeared in Britain to be the worst excess of diplomatic immunity - that a murderer should be allowed freely to return home and escape prosecution - looked like the best defence of immunity from Mr Miles's vantage point in Tripoli.</p> <p>Had the suspects inside the London embassy been subjected to trial, he and his staff in Libya would have had charges concocted against them and been put on trial, he says. </p> <p>After the shooting, UK authorities entered the Libyan embassy, searched it, and found a gun. That was an illegal intrusion on a sovereign diplomatic building, Mr Miles felt, and it had immediate repercussions for his staff. </p> <p>\"The Libyans promptly moved into our premises and found a gun,\" he says. \"My firm belief is that the Libyans planted that gun.\"</p> <p>The FO considers immunity \"fundamental\", allowing British diplomats to operate independent of local pressures and without fear of harassment in sometimes difficult circumstances. </p> <p>Mr Miles points out that it is not just states with immature or very different legal systems that create problems. When he was serving as an ambassador to the UN in New York in the 1980s, he says IRA supporters were outside the office every day, screaming obscenities at the British staff. The local police took little or no action, he says. </p> <p>He feels that, without immunity, the IRA would have been able to accuse British diplomats of false crimes that would nonetheless have ended up in front of a judge in New York. </p> <p>The most serious action a receiving state can take is to declare a diplomat persona non grata and expel him or her from the country. But if an incident is serious, an embassy may pre-empt such a dramatic move. </p> <p>In 2001, Libya's cultural attach\u00e9 to Britain attacked an anti-Gadafy demonstrator with a metal shelf outside a lecture at London's School of Oriental and African Studies. </p> <p>The Libyan ambassador, aware that the attack could damage delicate relations with Britain and raise fears that the Libyan president was launching a new terror campaign against opponents in exile, immediately expelled the attach\u00e9 without waiting for the Foreign Office to request it. </p> <p>\"Diplomatic immunity does not mean the diplomat is unassailable,\" Mr Forster explains. \"The immunity is the state's, not the diplomat's. The state can waive it against the diplomat's will, and this happens quite a lot when a serious crime has been committed.\"</p> <p>There is also an avenue of redress for victims, he says, although a potentially unsatisfactory one: bring an action against the diplomat in his home country. Immunity only applies in the receiving country, not at home. </p> <p>This is most likely to be effective if a diplomat is expelled swiftly while evidence and witnesses are still fresh. </p> <p>With the recent thaw in relations with Libya, Scotland Yard has begun working on the case of WPC Fletcher alongside Libyan investigators, although after 20 years detectives are not hopeful of a resolution.</p> <p>Even the 21 serious offences diplomats in Britain were accused of in 2002 covered a wide range, from shoplifting to fraud to domestic violence. Quite a few related to drink driving. And often a diplomatic leaves the country before the Foreign Office has a chance to become involved.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police said that even in the case of the Saudi diplomat, the public should not think that diplomatic immunity is necessarily the end of the road. </p> <p>\"We have been successful in bringing cases in the past,\" a spokesman says. \"The Saudi diplomat is sort of 'on bail' while the Foreign Office talk with the Saudi embassy.\" </p> <p>In 2002, the Foreign Office succeeded in convincing the Colombian embassy to waive immunity for one of its diplomats, Jairo Soto-Mendoza. He stood trial for the murder of a 23-year-old man, and was cleared at the Old Bailey.</p>"
