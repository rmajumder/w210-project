  "<p>Malcolm Glazer's attempt to buy Manchester United yesterday failed as the Irish investors J P McManus and John Magnier pulled out of talks on selling their key 28.9% stake. They are understood to have told the American tycoon that they are long-term investors and have no interest in selling to him at the proposed 300p a share. </p> <p>Despite the Glazer camp's description of the situation as \"fluid\", it is clear the Irishmen have already told the take-over panel, the City's watchdog and mergers and acquisitions, that there is no basis on which to continue talks. </p> <p>Neither side would comment officially, but a Stock Exchange statement today confirming Glazer's withdrawal appeared last night to be inevitable. The American's advisors have always made clear that a full take over offer would be impossible without first securing the Irish stake. </p> <p>JP Morgan, the investment bank working for Glazer, was thought to be making an eleventh hour attempt to rescue the talks, but this appeared to have virtually no chance of success. One source close to the talks said the negotiations had never proceeded beyond the outlined proposal delivered by J P Morgan to the Irish last Friday. </p> <p>The Irishmen's refusal to sell delighted supporters groups last night. </p> <p>Sean Bones of Shareholders United said: \"It is good news. We didn't want Malcolm Glazer at the club and we have made that clear.\" </p> <p>Jules Spencer, chairman of the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association, said: \"If it does turn out that Glazer has pulled out, we will be delighted but we will not take our eye off the ball until he officially declares that he is not going to make a bid.\" </p> <p>For Glazer, the failure of the talks will represent a minor humiliation after a week of apparent optimism in his camp that the Irish would sell. The American, owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, secured full financing for his planned bid and deployed a major investment bank and public relations firm to work for him. The City had assumed he had a clear indication of the price at which McManus and Magnier would be prepared to sell, but this appears not to have been the case. </p> <p>The Irishmen started buying United shares four years ago and their average purchase price is thought to have been 180p a share. At 300p a share - valuing United at \u00a3786m -they would have stood to make a profit of \u00a390m. </p> <p>Glazer is understood originally to have set a deadline at the end of this week to secure the crucial Irish stake. The timetable was designed partly to allow him to announce a full take over offer well before United's next home game against Arsenal a week on Sunday. He had planned to woo United's deeply sceptical fans with an increase in the transfer funds available to the manager Sir Alex Ferguson. </p> <p>He will now face the problem of what to do with his 19.2% stake in United, built up over the last 18 months. Other potential bidders may be deterred on two counts - the apparent unwillingness of McManus and Magnier to sell and the intense hostility on the part of many United fans to a take-over by a single individual. </p> <p>United's share price fell 3.8 per cent to 264p yesterday as rumours circulated of the collapsing talks. However, the decline had been steeper earlier in the day and the shares rallied when an expected statement from the club itself did not materialise. That statement is now likely to come today. </p> <p> Keith Harris, the chief executive of broking firm Seymour Pierce, is thought still to be working on a proposal to restructure United's ownership in a way that would be acceptable to fans. Details are vague, but it is clear that this is not a straightforward take-over proposal. </p> <p>United's annual report and accounts published yesterday and showed that chief executive David Gill received \u00a3909,000, mainly comprising a salary of \u00a3435,000, a cash bonus of \u00a3270,000 and bonus shares worth \u00a3185,000. </p> <p>It represented a significant increase on the \u00a3701,000 earned in the previous year by his predecessor Peter Kenyon, who resigned to join Chelsea.</p>",
  "<p>Bradford and Leeds are Super League neighbours, but the clubs that will contest the first all-Yorkshire grand final are worlds apart. Nowhere is that contrast more obvious than at half-back. </p> <p>Leeds have Danny McGuire, the shooting star of British rugby league, who has scored a record 37 tries in his first full season and whose dancing feet produce a buzz of expectation around Headingley every time he touches the ball. Bradford have Paul Deacon. </p> <p>It is not that Deacon is boring, exactly. But in almost 200 appearances since making his Bulls debut in 1998, he has still to reach a half-century of tries, and he does not pretend to be a player who sets pulses racing. \"That's just me,\" he said. \"I'd hate to be a glamour boy.\" </p> <p>The 25-year-old Wiganer, who was never wanted by his home-town club and started his career with lowly Oldham, has therefore found the perfect home at Odsal, where Bradford's style of play, for the most part built around their forwards and now augmented by the power of monstrous backs such as Lesley Vainikolo, has always suited the bleakness of the setting. </p> <p>It is hard to see Deacon fitting as comfortably into the comparatively palatial surroundings of Headingley, where McGuire and Leeds have spent this season playing champagne rugby in front of Super League's biggest corporate audience. </p> <p>\"We're the working men's club, aren't we?\" Deacon agreed with a grin. \"I love it at Bradford. It's that type of club where you walk in the office, have a laugh with the staff, and when we play the game we play it tough and hard.\" </p> <p>Yet tomorrow he will be playing in his fifth grand final in six years and when the Bradford coach Brian Noble announces his first Great Britain squad on Monday for the Gillette Tri-Nations series against Australia and New Zealand, the presence of his Bulls scrum-half will be taken for granted. With the injury doubt surrounding Sean Long, Deacon will almost certainly be Britain's starting No7 for the tournament. </p> <p>He may not be flashy, but he is efficient, consistent, a sound defender, and his kicking can be devastating: his steepling bombs produced the two tries that helped to propel Bradford to Old Trafford with a 26-12 win at Leeds two weeks ago, and he is such an accurate goalkicker that there was no question of Iestyn Harris taking over when he joined the Bulls from Cardiff in mid-season. </p> <p>\"He doesn't say a lot and he doesn't get much credit,\" says Harris of his new half-back partner. \"But in the crunch games Deacs always seems to be the one that puts in the right kick. He's a good bloke to have around.\" </p> <p>Deacon's big break came in 2001, when Henry Paul left Bradford for rugby union. Before then, he admits, his Bulls career had been full of frustrations, with Paul and his younger brother Robbie the regular starting half-backs, leaving him on the bench, and his first two grand final appearances were as a substitute, and in each he was not introduced until well into the second half. </p> <p>\"Henry leaving gave me the chance of cementing my spot at half-back,\" he reflects. \"Coming off the bench was very frustrating, because I've always wanted to be in the thick of it. When Henry went, a lot of responsibility was put on my shoulders. That's what I've always wanted.\" </p> <p>He was man of the match in his first grand final as Bradford's starting scrum-half in 2002 - without doing anything spectacular, obviously - but the award meant little as a late Long drop-goal snatched a dramatic and controversial 19-18 win for St Helens. </p> <p>The experience at Old Trafford last year was much more satisfying, as he kicked six goals from as many attempts and added an important drop-goal in the Bulls' 25-18 victory over Wigan. </p> <p>But for much of this season Bradford's prospects of reaching another grand final to defend their title had seemed remote. A defeat at Hull in early August left them fifth in the table, and three weeks later they were drubbed 40-12 at Leeds. </p> <p>\"We learned a lot when Leeds battered us at Headingley,\" Deacon admits. Apparently Noble was so upset he went straight to Odsal after the match and studied the video into the small hours. \"We did a lot of soul-searching among ourselves as players, and we've just improved every week since. Everyone's playing at the top of their game at the moment.\" </p> <p>Not that anyone watching Deacon would notice much difference. \"I'm probably not known for my running and I'm not that type of player,\" he conceded. \"I've not got the speed or elusiveness of players like Sean Long. I have been working on taking the line on, but you've got to do it at the right times. There's no point me just carting it up like a prop forward - that wouldn't do much for the team. I try to organise the team, tell them where to go.\" </p> <p>\"He's an unfussy, straightforward, honest lad,\" said an approving Chris Caisley, who as befits a Bradford chairman - even one whose legal practice is in the middle of Leeds - relishes those qualities more than most. \"He's straight, a good citizen, never a moment's trouble. He epitomises everything that's good about what we try to do.\" </p> <p><strong>Glamour boy... </strong></p> <p><strong>Danny McGuire</strong><br> Leeds Rhinos<br> Age: 21<br> Amateur club: East Leeds<br> Debut: 2001<br> Career appearances: 73 (including subs)<br> Career tries: 61<br> Strike rate: 83.5%<br> Career goals: 1 drop goal<br></p> <p><strong>2004</strong><br> Appearances: 29 (including subs)<br> Tries: 38<br> Goals: 0<br></p> <p> <strong>...v likely lad</strong></p> <p><strong>Paul Deacon</strong><br> Bradford Bulls<br> Age: 25<br> Amateur club: Hindley Juniors<br> Debut: 1998<br> Career appearances: 217 (incl subs)<br> Career tries: 50<br> Strike rate: 23.0%<br> Career goals: 583 (incl 15 drop goals)</p> <p><strong>2004</strong> Appearances: 28 Tries: 8 Goals: 124 (incl 2 drop goals)</p>",
  "<p>Fears that Jonny Wilkinson had aggravated the shoulder injury that kept him on the sidelines for the first eight months of the year were allayed yesterday by Rob Andrew, his head coach at Newcastle. </p> <p>Wilkinson did not do any contact work with England this week after taking a knock at Wasps last Sunday, but he has been named in the Newcastle side for Sunday's Premiership match against Saracens at Kingston Park. </p> <p>\"Jonny suffered deep bruising on his bicep and it has nothing to do with the injury he had before,\" Andrew said. \"He picked it up in Connacht in his comeback game, and though the problem is not serious, it's very painful if you get whacked again on the same spot.\" </p> <p>The decision of the acting England head coach Andy Robinson to invest the captaincy of the national side in Wilkinson did not receive universal acclaim given the fly-half's form in the past six weeks, but Andrew said the 25-year-old had made an impressive comeback. </p> <p>\"I think he has gone really well,\" said Andrew. \"He's getting back into the physicality of the Premiership and he has probably stuttered a bit in recent weeks because the team collectively has: we have conceded 11 tries in our last two matches and we need a steely defensive performance on Sunday. Jonny is fine physically. He has not done any contact training with us this week, but he is fit to play this weekend.\" </p> <p>Robinson's appointment as England's head coach could be confirmed inside 24 hours after his 2-hour presentation to a Rugby Football Union panel at Twickenham yesterday. </p> <p>Although only four members of the supposed five-man selection board were present - the former Bath and England centre Simon Halliday was unable to attend because of a business commitment - RFU sources indicated the 40-year-old Robinson would learn swiftly if he were to be chosen as Sir Clive Woodward's long-term successor. </p> <p>After a 12-year old boy was taken to hospital following a half-time pitch invasion last weekend, the capacity for Llanelli's Welsh Premiership match against Cross Keys tomorrow has been cut from 10,800 to 4,649. The reduction may be reversed for the Heineken Cup visit of Toulouse next Friday if the Scarlets implement more effective crowd control.</p>",
  "<p><strong> When a brutal regime were jolly good chaps</strong><br> </p> <p> Zimbabwe continues to haunt English cricket. The imminent one-day series rushes at it like an angry rhino and this weekend a delegation from Lord's visits Harare, desperately hoping a new security check might offer a get-out clause. A diversion to the whole sorry saga has been watching the poacher-turned-gamekeeper Peter Hain defend his government's non-intervention stance. Hain, of course, was heroic leader of the Ban the Boks campaign in 1969 that stopped in its tracks the upcoming tour here by South Africa's cricketers. </p> <p>Truth is, that was kyboshed with finality by government intervention when the Home Secretary James Callaghan simply called in Lord's eminence Gubby Allen and told him he couldn't guarantee security so - \"no more fannying my good fellow\" - the invitation to South Africa had to be withdrawn and the tour abandoned. If that wasn't \"government intervention\", what was? </p> <p>By coincidence, 40 years ago this very week MCC's England touring team of 1964 arrived in Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia) to begin its tour of South Africa. No remote bother then that England's finest were on a four-month trip to a state far more systematically barbaric and racist than Robert Mugabe's little tinpot demesne today. I remember how all the players were overwhelmingly eager for that tour - England's star bat Ted Dexter even hurried out there to join the team a week late after fighting (and losing) for the Conservative party the general election on October 15 in the seat of Cardiff south-east against that same James Callaghan. The tour began with a 10-wicket win against Matabeleland at Bulawayo on October 21 (MJK Smith 60, P Parfitt 55, F Titmus 7-58) after which there was a (still) famous and hospitable all-night welcoming party for the team. Whites only, of course - for it was still 19 months before Basil D'Oliveira was to be selected for England. </p> <p><strong> Clarke misses bus on an epic last lap</strong><br> </p> <p>Forty years on ... That 1964 general election coincided exactly with the Olympic Games in Tokyo. I was working for ITV then and the first Olympic race I ever saw remains, still, the most unforgettable - the fulminating 10,000 metres when, from the bell, three careering athletes hared, hacked and barged their way through the tail-end traffic in an unimaginably fevered last lap. The Australian favourite Ron Clarke, the Tunisian Mohamed Gammoudi, and the US outsider Billy Mills ... shoulder to shoulder, jabbing elbow to viciously jabbing elbow ... </p> <p>\"Crazy, like a dash for the train through a rush-hour crowd,\" said an inconsolable Clarke at the tape. Shades of Radcliffe. The gallant goodie Clarke was to run four Olympic races in that week - two at 5,000m (ninth in the final), the 10,000m (third) and the marathon (ninth). </p> <p>The joyously unbelievable surge by Mills to win that 10,000m remains vivid to this day. \"Like being hit by a rabbit-punch at the end of a gruelling 15-rounder,\" said Clarke. None of us had heard of Mills. \"Name, please? Who you, sir?\" demanded the Japanese line-judge at the end. </p> <p>The engaging Mills was part Sioux and, sort of, a real live Sergeant Bilko because he was the motor-pool sergeant at a Marine base in California. And in no time, of course, Hollywood's razzmatazz men made the biopic Billy: Running Brave (1983). It was not remotely as dramatic as the real thing.</p> <p><strong> Worcester's new battle</strong><br> </p> <p> Local derbies are meant to be suffused with time-honoured contention and settlement of scores and sores that date far back into the mists. Not rugby's newest un-neighbourly barney - cauliflower ears all round - which begins tomorrow when Gloucester travel the half-hour up the M5 to play Worcester in the Premiership. </p> <p>For more than a century, Gloucester have been among the most renowned clubs in world rugby and less than a decade ago, before Worcester's elevating run of promotions from the game's obscure pastoral backwaters, none could have imagined the clubs of the two cathedral cities ever getting to grips for a properly competitive happening. </p> <p>For such a substantial and booming city, Worcester needs some matching success at sport. Its soccer team has always been pallidly anonymous (now languishing incongruously in the Nationwide Conference North); and its county cricketers have had a miserably grey summer down by the riverside. Its rugby has a long, severe winter in prospect just to disprove the so far cruelly infallible Premiership law that what comes up must instantly go down. A win tomorrow would gladden romantics, although the seasoned toughs of Gloucester won't be neighbourly, that's for sure. </p> <p><strong> There'll always be an England if not a Jones</strong><br> </p> <p>Has there ever been a Welsh soccer side without a Jones or a Davies in it, asked the Radio 5 man on Saturday? Or a Williams or Evans, come to that? By my reckoning, the last was 30 years ago next month - November 20 v Luxembourg at Swansea (won 5-0): Sprake; Thomas, England, Roberts, Phillips, James, Mahoney, Yorath, Reece, Griffiths, Toshack. </p> <p>I saw that rout, and also the next match against Hungary and the famous 2-1 win in Budapest, when Everton's Welsh speaker Dai Davies played a blinder to begin his long tenure between the sticks. Wales's present goalkeeper is the 54th Jones to play soccer for Wales. There have been 41 Davieses, 25 Williamses, and 19 Evanses. </p> <p>For rugby the surname score is: Jones 72, Davies 59, Williams 49, Evans 46, not counting two nice hooraying <em>coups de grace</em> - namely one Jones-Davies (capped 1930) and one Williams-Jones (1989).</p>",
  "The path to St Peter's Anglican church in Yoxall runs through a traditional graveyard with mown grass, yew trees, headstones ancient and modern. It's very English, the kind of place where Thomas Gray could have written his elegy. <p>But then you see a notice on yellow paper pinned to a board in the church. It tells of an imminent service for which there can be few precedents: \"All people from the community are invited as we pray for the return of sanctity and peace to this place.\"</p> <p>Tomorrow the churchyard and burial ground of this Staffordshire village will be rededicated as the rector, the Rev Jenny Lister, seeks to cleanse it of a horror that has appalled people of all faiths and none.</p> <p>Sometime last week, someone came to St Peter's at dead of night and dug up the coffin of 82-year-old Gladys Hammond, who died in 1997. Then this week Staffordshire police revealed that most of her remains had been stolen in the raid.</p> <p>One line of inquiry is whether animal rights extremists were to blame. Mrs Hammond is the mother-in-law of Chris Hall, who, with his brother John and father David, owns Darley Oaks Farm, just up the A515 in Newchurch. They breed guinea pigs for medical research, a trade that has led to five years of protests and a terror campaign aimed at anyone who has social or business contacts with the Halls.</p> <p>\"Everyone has been very supportive and we are very grateful for the messages we have received,\" said Chris Hall this week. \"It is a barbarous, atrocious act and we are just trying to come to terms with it.\"</p> <p>Yesterday Staffordshire police were questioning two men, aged 41 and 34, whom they arrested in early morning raids at homes in Coventry and Wolverhampton. Searches and forensic science tests were being carried out at the two addresses.</p> <p>Inside St Peter's church, a small table with a white tablecloth has been placed in the chancel. A single candle burns to reinforce the message on a prayer card: \"Circle me, Lord. Keep light near and darkness afar.\"</p> <p>In a new condolence book next to a colour photograph of the burial ground, someone has written: \"May we find it in our hearts to forgive them for the terrible thing they have done.\"</p> <p>Outside, autumn sun shines on a wildflower garden as the path moves from the old churchyard to the newer burial ground. And there is Mrs Hammond's grave, covered with new turf, flowers and more sad messages: \"May Gladys and all the faithful departed rest in peace.\"</p> <p>A Yoxall man, who has few doubts about who is to blame for the sacrilege, pauses nearby. \"As I walk past here, it's difficult not to burst into tears, it really is,\" he says.</p> <p>\"The whole village is aghast, even people who did not know the family. And somewhere there are people who are proud of what they have done.\" </p> <p>Like almost everyone in this story, the man prefers not to be named. \"People are frightened of coming in the [activists'] sights. You are a sitting duck against an anonymous army. When you drive past the protesters at the farm, the little old ladies who have sincerely held views stand at the front. Those with the brick ends are somewhere at the back.\"</p> <p>The road to the farm, a huddle of brick buildings and nondescript sheds, is quiet during the week, with shouting and blowing of whistles by protesters limited to between noon and 3pm on Sundays.</p> <p>Janet Tomlinson, from nearby Burton-on-Trent, has been a regular since the protests began five years ago.</p> <p>\"As soon as we got to the farm last Sunday, the police told us to go away or we would be arrested. You could see the hate in the eyes of the police officers. It was like the Nazis talking to the Jews.\"</p> <p>Ms Tomlinson is receiving treatment for breast cancer. \"Some people might accuse me of hypocrisy but I have to take it because there is no alternative. You cannot take any medicine in this country that has not been tested on an animal.\"</p> <p>She had nothing to do with the attack on Mrs Hammond's grave and does not know anyone who would have anything to do with it. \"I think it's awful. But I don't think it was done by animal rights [activists] and I think it's wrong of the media to suggest it is us.\"</p> <p>She will not attend tomorrow's service. \"I couldn't go anywhere near the Halls and feel right. I'd feel a hypocrite if I went. But I do feel sorry for the poor woman who has been dug up.\"</p> <p>The Halls live in Newborough, three miles from their farm. There, everyone has learned to watch their step, keep themselves to themselves, check identities.</p> <p>\"We had months of maroons - like lifeboat shells - being let off every weekend,\" said one man who has no connection with the Hall family. \"Twenty-five or 50 of them - every two minutes at two in the morning. They tried that for 18 months or two years. That didn't work and it has just escalated from there.</p> <p>\"We had a Christmas carol concert in the church and then a get-together outside the pub. [The protesters] all came down in their vans and marched through the people singing carols. The police chased after them but it ruined the night.</p> <p>\"There is always that fear at the back of your mind. Some of the older people have been here for up to 40 years and are very involved with village life. They put functions on in our hall but now are in fear of doing anything like that because they are friends of the Halls.\"</p>",
  "<p>Every time Kate Swann, chief executive of WH Smith, opens her mouth, it must be excruciatingly embarrassing for her predecessor, Richard Handover. </p> <p>At every public outing since becoming head prefect at back-to-school specialist WHS, she has given Handover a thorough hand-bagging. </p> <p>At the half-year her theme was the badly-run business she had inherited, which had no basic retail discipline, empty shelves and dreadful products. </p> <p>Yesterday it was Handover's idea of a sales promotion - especially the buy-one-book-and-get-another-half-price (Bobagahp) he was masterminding this time last year. It sounds a tad like the Bobagahp campaign Swann has also run - except that Handover's extended to every book in the store. </p> <p>\"It applied to the whole range, even the Highway Code,\" she said scathingly. \"Why promote the Highway Code? No one buys the Highway Code unless they need one, even if it is half price\". </p> <p>She has a point. </p> <p>It isn't unusual for bosses facing a serious uphill climb out of the deep sticky stuff to be less than fully appreciative of their predecessor's efforts - think Justin King, Stuart Rose, Ken Morrison (and that just the retail sector of recent months) - but the difference at WHS is that Doneover is still there - hiding in the chairman's office. </p> <p>His entire strategy of cutting margins to drive volume is in tatters, and Swann is now focusing on rebuilding margins. </p> <p>After yesterday's kitchen sinking - the \u00a3200m write-off - she is almost bound to make some progress, at least in the short term. More embarrassment for Turnedover thus looms. When he was elevated to the top suite, after Christmas, he was not expected to be in residence long enough to even get the seat warm. Yet here we are, approaching this Christmas, and he's still there - though frankly, without the aid of a heat-seeking device, you would never know it. </p> <p>There are suggestions of some action soon - but what can possibly be taking so long? </p> <p><strong>Crowd trouble</strong><br> It was worth having a ticket yesterday to watch Abbey National shareholders vote on the \u00a39bn takeover by Banco Santander Central Hispano. There was the chairman, Terry Burns, fighting in vain to control angry private shareholders; there was the ringleader among rebel investors, calling a motion to adjourn the meeting; we had genuine crowd trouble as investors started to row among themselves; and there was even the equivalent of a pitch invasion as one investor mounted the stage and confronted Burns in person. </p> <p>This was the reality of shareholder democracy: 900 Abbey investors who braved the wind and the rain to travel to Wembley, and watch their protestations swept aside by institutional proxy votes. </p> <p>They made their point, though. </p> <p><strong>One-day wonder</strong><br> London's Alternative Investment Market sometimes seems to rival the infamously wild Vancouver exchange as a place to make or lose fortunes in double-quick time. </p> <p>Take China Wonder, which joined the junior London market at the start of the month, heralding itself as \"a landmark flotation, being the first domestic Chinese company to seek admission to Aim\". On October 1, 500,000 new shares in Wonder were sold at 24p apiece; with existing holders sitting on 10m shares, this \"leading Chinese manufacturer and distributor of specialist packaging machinery to the Chinese pharmaceutical market\" floated with a market capitalisation of \u00a32.52m. </p> <p>After a flurry of interest over the past fortnight, shares in this company suddenly accelerated by 45p to 115p yesterday. This was in the absence of any apparent price-moving news. So this firm, based in Liaoning province, north-east China, with sales last year of \u00a31.4m and pre-tax profits of \u00a3254,000, now has a market value of \u00a312m and a price/earnings multiple of 50. </p> <p>Wonder employs 110 staff and makes four types of packaging machines: five types of bubble-cap packer, four bag-capping machines, one film-heating shrinkage packer, and two labellers. </p> <p>Everyone knows that China, with an internal market of 1.4bn, presents a fabulous growth story in all sorts of areas. But bubble-wrap packaging? A cynic would suggest there's a subliminal message here. </p> <p>Luckily, a former fund manager called Mark Chapman is executive deputy chairman. Chapman is an affable, hard-working type who is perhaps best known in London as the man who tried to rescue an inappropriately named venture called Powerhouse Resources. </p> <p>Powerhouse was previously known as Com-Tek Resources and was run by an exotic financier called Malcolm Stone, who was promising to build and run a string of power stations across China in the early 1990s. When those plans were questioned in these pages, Stone threatened to sue - but the matter did not come to any thing since the financier was soon arrested and jailed. </p> <p>Chapman tried to make sense of the wreckage and did actually manage to complete one power plant before leaving Powerhouse in 1999. </p> <p>Let's hope his hard experience delivers dividends this time around.</p>",
  "<p>Sean \"Puffy\" Combs has made many outlandish claims over the years, but none quite as implausible as the title of his 2002 compilation: We Invented the Remix. Arriving roughly 20 years too late, he might as well have alleged that he had invented helicopters or toast. Given Combs's usual reliance on phoned-in guest raps and crashingly obvious samples, a more apt title might have been We Devalued the Remix, but that doesn't really have the same ring to it. </p> <p>Depeche Mode didn't invent the remix either, but they can take some credit for nurturing it. The Basildon synth giants' new album, Remixes 81-04, collects 37 diverse revamps: Underworld nail Barrel of a Gun to a steely techno undercarriage; Alison Goldfrapp adds her own vocals to Halo, blurring the line between remix and cover version; German DJ Timo Maas and Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda both tackle the oft-remixed Enjoy the Silence. As an illustration of the remix's potential, Remixes 81-04 is at the opposite end of the creative spectrum to those identikit house versions of pop hits that apparently exist solely to be played in upscale urban gyms. </p> <p>The remix is music's mutant gene. A remixer can simply beef up a track's dancefloor capability, or they can completely recontextualise it; retain the song's key elements, or create a whole new track in all but name; eclipse the original, or make you beg for its safe return. And a remix can be the most avant-garde art project, or it can be the tackiest cash-in; a virtual collaboration with the artist, or an act of vandalism; alchemy, or travesty. </p> <p>Remixing originated in 1960s Jamaica, when sound system producers such as Lee Perry and King Tubby stripped reggae songs down to their instrumental skeletons and called them dub versions. \"It's weird because it's separate from everything else,\" says Bill Brewster, dance-music historian and co-author of Last Night a DJ Saved My Life. \"Early disco remixers wouldn't have been aware of what was going on in the reggae scene. Things happened independently.\" </p> <p>For the disco scene, remixing was simply to make tracks more danceable. In 1974, a former model called Tom Moulton produced the first commercially successful disco remix when he doubled the length of BT Express's Do It 'Till You're Satisfied. The band loathed it until it became a massive crossover hit, at which point they brazenly claimed that it was their idea all along. </p> <p>As the 12-inch single took off in the late 1970s, disco mixes often proved more popular than radio versions. Soon, mainstream acts cottoned on: the Rolling Stones' 1978 hit Miss You came with an eight-minute \"extended dance mix\". Remixers such as Moulton, Walter Gibbons and Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian became big names in their own right, while some forward-thinking bands, including Depeche Mode, began taking a scalpel to their own work. </p> <p>\"It was just an experiment,\" says Depeche Mode's songwriter, Martin Gore. \"It wasn't like today, when people put out multiple CDs to get higher chart positions. It was a way to take songs in a different direction.\" </p> <p>During the 1980s, remixes became a generic means of padding out 12-inches, whether or not the song demanded it. For every band like Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who saw remixes as a forum for ambitious experimentation, there were countless others who regarded them as a box to be ticked: put a bit of echo on the vocals, drop a percussion breakdown in the middle and Bob's your underwhelming uncle. </p> <p>Usually, remixers left the original song fundamentally intact, but that changed with the arrival of DJ Andrew Weatherall. Commissioned to remix faltering indie band Primal Scream's I'm Losing More Than I'll Ever Have in 1990, he delivered an instrumental club track so dissimilar that it even had a different name: Loaded. Instantly revitalising Primal Scream's career, it established the cult of the remixer. Fans would buy anything with Weatherall's name on, regardless of the original song's quality, safe in the knowledge that he could make a silk's purse out of any sow's ear. </p> <p>Following Weatherall, the whole notion of authorship became muddied. The writing credits may name the original composers, but when the whole song has been rebuilt, is it really theirs anymore? Most record buyers who took Armand Van Helden's reinvention of Tori Amos's Professional Widow to number one had never bought an Amos record before and never would again. It was basically a Van Helden track. \"Effectively, it's reproduction rather than remixing,\" says Brewster. </p> <p>The most extreme practitioner of the slash-and-burn approach was Richard James, aka the Aphex Twin, who gave his collection of radical overhauls the title 26 Mixes for Cash. Legend has it that one day a courier arrived to collect a Lemonheads remix that James had forgotten about, so he just snatched a random instrumental off the shelf. Not that the record company were gullible enough to actually release it. </p> <p>\"You get to the point where you think, what is a remix?,\" says Gore. \"For me, there has to be some reference to the original somewhere. There's one that we vetoed where there wasn't one sound or one word from the original song. It was at a different tempo, in a different key - it was basically a different song.\" His reaction echoes Gloria Gaynor's nonplussed response, two decades earlier, to Tom Moulton's remix of Never Can Say Goodbye. \"I don't sing much,\" she glumly observed. </p> <p>A sympathetic remix can transform careers. House versions of Everything But the Girl's Missing and Moloko's Sing It Back, by Todd Terry and Boris Dlugosch respectively, inspired the bands to make club records themselves. In other cases, it's the remixer who benefits most. Ewan Pearson has made more impact with reworks of Goldfrapp, the Chemical Brothers and, most recently, Depeche Mode's Enjoy the Silence, than with his own material. </p> <p>\"It's the best job in the world,\" he says. \"It's like being given a Lego set for Christmas. You get sent the parts for a great record, you're left on your own to do what you like and, provided you meet the brief in some way, everybody's happy.\" </p> <p>Tom Rowlands of the Chemical Brothers, whose early remixes helped make their name, agrees: \"It was a brilliant time. One week we'd do Method Man, another week we'd do Primal Scream. The pressure's not on. You get an idea from someone else and use it as a starting point. It isn't a long, protracted thing like making an album.\" </p> <p>Some prolific remixers, notably Austria's Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister, have licensed back their work and successfully released it under their own name, but there's always the risk of overkill. \"Most people on the remix treadmill find it's very hard to keep reinventing themselves when they're doing them every week and the money is so seductive,\" says Brewster. \"It helps you financially in the short term but drains your creative energy in the long term. It can destroy people's careers.\" </p> <p>This almost happened to Trevor Jackson, who has a new remix collection under his Playgroup alias. During the 1990s, he traded as Underdog, and recorded 80 remixes, including ones for U2 and Massive Attack. Lucrative and educational at first, the job eventually lost its appeal. \"In retrospect, it stopped me making my own music,\" he says. \"Every time I did a mix I was proud of, I felt like I was giving away a piece of myself. I did it for love of the music, and I began to hate being part of the marketing game.\" </p> <p>Pearson faced a similar quandary when his stock suddenly skyrocketed last year. \"I got asked to remix about 70 records and I did four. Sometimes it's just useful marketing to have your name on a record, and that's flattering - but weird. I try my hardest to make a living while maintaining some kind of integrity.\" </p> <p>Rowlands has a simple rule of thumb. \"You have to like the records but you can't like them too much. We got asked to remix New Order and, even though it was a great honour, we thought, what's the point?\" </p> <p>Acts commissioning remixes have to be equally shrewd. Some, including Depeche Mode, U2 and Manic Street Preachers, have consistently released high-quality mixes, but others treat them as lazy, often misguided, marketing tools. Although record label remix budgets have shrunk since the mid-90s dance boom, there is still much more dross than gold. </p> <p>These days, many of the most exciting remixes are never officially released: they appear on the internet as unlicensed bootlegs. Easily available software has democratised the remix, giving every bedroom producer the opportunity to create a dialogue with their favourite records. According to one Depeche Mode remix site, there are no fewer than 345 versions of their 2001 single, I Feel Loved, and the number of unofficial remixes of Eminem or Missy Elliott runs into the thousands. In remix culture, an original song isn't necessarily the definitive version: it's just one of myriad alternatives. But sometimes, the most tantalising possibilities go unrealised. </p> <p>\"Last summer, at the height of the franticness, I was offered a remix of a new indie band that I passed on,\" says a rueful Ewan Pearson. \"Found the CD the other day. It was Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out. Bugger.\" </p> <p><strong>Top 10 remixes</strong></p> <p><strong> Donna Summer - I Feel Love (Patrick Cowley mega mix, 1982)</strong> </p> <p>San Francisco DJ Cowley, who died of AIDS later that year, stretched Summer's Hi-NRG anthem over a dizzying 20 minutes. </p> <p><strong> New Order - Bizarre Love Triangle (Shep Pettibone Extended Dance mix, 1986)</strong> </p> <p>The go-to guy of the 1980s remix scene (Madonna, Pet Shop Boys, Run-DMC) gave New Order one of their biggest US hits. </p> <p><strong> Eric B &amp; Rakim - Paid in Full (Coldcut's Seven Minutes of Madness mix, 1988)</strong> </p> <p>A benchmark remix, incorporating both Israeli singer Ofra Haza and 1950s British radio star Geoffrey Sumner. Only Eric B was unimpressed, deeming it \"girly disco music\". </p> <p><strong> My Bloody Valentine - Soon (Andrew Weatherall mix, 1990)</strong> </p> <p>One of Weatherall's earliest and best remixes wrapped My Bloody Valentine's psychedelic slur around a monolithic hip-hop beat. </p> <p><strong> Mory Kant\u00e9 - Yeke Yeke (Hardfloor mix, 1994)</strong> </p> <p>West African pop meets D\u00fcsseldorf acid house. Oddly enough, Nigella Lawson chose it as a Desert Island Disc. </p> <p><strong> Depeche Mode - Useless (The Kruder + Dorfmeister Session, 1997)</strong> </p> <p>One of Martin Gore's favourite Depeche Mode remixes, this nine-minute head-nodder became a chillout favourite. </p> <p><strong> Cornershop - Brimful of Asha (Norman Cook Full Length remix, 1998)</strong> </p> <p>Under its own steam, Brimful of Asha reached number 60. After the Fatboy Slim treatment it topped the charts, briefly making Cornershop Britain's grumpiest pop stars. </p> <p><strong> Blur - Tender (Cornelius remix, 1999)</strong> </p> <p>Adding a spine-shivering guitar part and a flurry of drum'n'bass, Japanese eccentric Cornelius made the gospel-rock album version sound plodding. </p> <p><strong> Tori Amos - Professional Widow (Armand's Star Trunk Funkin' mix, 1996)</strong> </p> <p>Van Helden foregrounded his own monstrous bassline, while reducing Amos's contribution to snippets of breathy innuendo (\"It's gotta be big!\"). </p> <p><strong> Azzido da Bass - Dooms Night (Timo Maas remix, 2000)</strong> </p> <p>Maas's eardrum-scouring reinvention was so effective that eventually the remix got remixed while the original was forgotten. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Remixes 81-04 by Depeche Mode is released by Mute on October 25.

  "Anna Politkovskaya was born into Soviet high society; the kind of privileged, metropolitan elite that knew abroad better than it knew the factories of the Urals, and whose children were guaranteed comfortable jobs in the rambling bureaucracies of Moscow. <p>Half a life later, in her 40s and a mother of two children, Politkovskaya found herself alone at night in the Chechen hills, fleeing through the darkness. She was running from the Russian security service, the FSB, which wanted to arrest her, but out there in the highlands of a lawless region steeped in bloodshed, she could have fallen victim to anyone or anything; Chechen bandits, Russian or Chechen government death squads, a broken neck. It was Europe, in 2002. </p> <p>\"I walked the whole night,\" she says. \"I wanted to stay alive! It was terrifying. I reached the [Chechen] village of Stary Atagi at dawn. I stayed there for a day and a night, keeping my head down ...\" She talks about it for a while, then seems to check herself, feeling perhaps that telling a stranger about one of the numerous occasions in her career as a journalist that she faced a threat of imprisonment or serious harm is irrelevant to the serious business of reporting. \"These are just details,\" she says, finally. </p> <p>In the bland setting of a publisher's London flat, you can see in Politkovskaya, one of the bravest of Russia's many brave journalists, the different ages of her life, and her looking serious in each of them: the bookish student of the 1970s, the earnest, curious young Soviet reporter, the journalist who embraced the freedoms of perestroika in the late 1980s, the veteran of Russia's recent conflicts who returns time and again to Chechnya to enrage the Kremlin leadership as it seeks to make of Vladimir Putin an infallible khan. </p> <p>Her seriousness is not just her frown, her severe glasses and full head of grey hair. It's the tension, anger and impatience in her whole body, making clear that her sense of the continual injustice being perpetrated in her homeland never leaves her, that she can't shut it out in a way almost all British journalists, even the campaigning, radical kind, can. </p> <p>It's a surprise, then, to see her start to laugh and make fun of the Guardian's photographer when he gets her to pose for him. \"Photographers always do that,\" she says, in her hesitant English. \"They get people to do things they don't normally do.\" The photographer gets quite annoyed and you realise that Politkovskaya is still young (she's 46). And still hopeful. The author picture on the back of her new book, Putin's Russia, is so self-consciously tragic, and its subject matter so bleak, that I ask her whether she thinks it might take generations for her country to become truly free. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't ever want to say it would take generations,\" she says. \"I want to be able to live the life of a human being, where every individual is respected, in my lifetime.\" </p> <p>Politkovskaya was born in New York, where her Soviet Ukrainian parents were UN diplomats, in 1958, five years after the death of Stalin. She was sent back home to be educated and after school entered one of the most prestigious university departments in the USSR, the journalism faculty of Moscow State University. Among its other advantages, her parents' diplomatic status enabled them to smuggle banned books into the country for her, and she was able to write her dissertation about a normally forbidden poet, the emigre Marina Tsvetayeva. </p> <p>After graduation, Politkovskaya worked for the daily Izvestiya, then moved to the in-house paper of the state airline monopoly Aeroflot. \"Every journalist got a free ticket all year round; you could go on any plane and fly wherever you wanted. Thanks to this I saw the whole of our huge country. I was a girl from a diplomatic family, a reader, a bit of a swot; I didn't know life at all.\" </p> <p>With the coming of perestroika, Politkovskaya switched to the independent press which began to emerge and flourish: first Obshchaya Gazeta, then Novaya Gazeta (New Newspaper). None of the terrible things that have happened in Russia since the coming to power of the reformer Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 have persuaded Politkovskaya that it would have been better to preserve the USSR. </p> <p>\"From an economic point of view, life became very difficult,\" she says, \"but politically it wasn't shocking at all. It was simple happiness, that you could read and think and write whatever you wanted. It was a joy. You need to endure a great deal in the way of economic hardship for the sake of freedom.\" </p> <p>Hardly had the new countries of the former Soviet Union begun to stand on their feet, however, than a series of internal wars broke out. The most savage of them, continuing to this day, involves various attempts by Russian government troops to regain control over the small region of Chechnya. Politkovskaya became one of the most dogged reporters of that conflict. </p> <p>Russians speak of two Chechen wars: the first, under Yeltsin, from 1994 to 1996, ended with a peace deal and troop withdrawal under pressure from the media and public. When Putin invaded for a second time, in 1999, he took steps to ensure that the media would not embarrass him with reports about the reality of Russia's brutality in Chechnya. If, as Politkovskaya believes, stopping the first Chechen war was the Russian media's greatest achievement in the relatively free Yeltsin years, the second Chechen war has been its greatest disaster. Once an independent voice among many, Novaya Gazeta is now among the few Russian media outlets which have not yet been intimidated into toeing the Kremlin line. </p> <p>The second Chechen war began by costing Politkovskaya her marriage. She returned home to Moscow one day in 1999, fresh from reporting on a long-range Russian rocket attack in Grozny which had hit a market and a maternity hospital, killing scores of people, including women and children, to hear her husband tell her: \"I can't take this any more.\" Recently, it almost cost her her life, when, on her way to Beslan in the early hours of the school hostage crisis, she was slipped poison in a cup of tea. In between, she has experienced countless death threats from Russian troops, Chechen fighters and the other, more shadowy armed groups operating in the margins of the war. The kidnappings, extrajudicial killings, disappearances, rapes and tortures she has reported on in Chechnya have left her convinced that Putin's policies are engendering the terrorists they are supposed to eliminate. </p> <p>\"To this day there's torture in any FSB branch in Chechnya, like the so-called 'telephone', where they pass an electric current through a person's body. I've seen hundreds of people who've been through this torture. Some have been tortured in such an intricate way that it's hard for me to believe that it was done by people who went to the same sort of schools that I did, who read the same textbooks.\" </p> <p>Politkovskaya has no regrets about the times she has stepped outside the role of reporter in recent Chechen terrorist attacks - as a negotiator in the Moscow theatre siege, and as a would-be negotiator at Beslan, before she was poisoned. \"Yes, I went beyond my journalistic role,\" she says. \"But it would be quite wrong to say that doing so was a bad move from a journalistic point of view. By setting aside my role as journalist I learned so much that I would never have found out being just a plain journalist, who stands in the crowd along with everyone else.\" </p> <p>She has harsh words for what she sees as the west's kid-glove treatment of Putin and Russia. \"Most of the time they forget the word Chechnya. They only remember it when there's a terrorist act. And then it's, 'Oh!' And they start their full coverage up again. But virtually nobody reports on what is really going on in that zone, in Chechnya, and the growth of terrorism. The truth is that the methods employed in Putin's anti-terrorist operation are generating a wave of terrorism the like of which we have never experienced.\" </p> <p>The Bush-Blair \"war on terror\" has been of enormous help to Putin, Politkovskaya says. Many people in Russia gained perverse comfort from the pictures of US abuses in Abu Ghraib prison. \"I've heard it many times. In Russia you hear people talking about it with pride: that, 'We treated the blacks like this before the Americans did, and we were right, because they are international terrorists.' </p> <p>\"Putin's begun to try to prove on the world stage that he's also fighting international terrorists, that he's just a part of this fashionable war. And he's been successful. He was Blair's best friend for a while. When, after Beslan, he began to state that we were seeing virtually the hand of Bin Laden, it was appalling. What's Bin Laden got to do with it? The Russian government created these beasts, brought them up, and they came to Beslan and behaved like beasts.\" </p> <p>The only way for the west to regain moral authority, Politkovskaya argues, would be for it to treat Putin as it treats Alexander Lukashenko, the autocratic, bullying president of Russia's neighbour Belarus - not sanctions, but a more personal, tailored form of ostracism. \"It's impossible to talk on the one hand about the monstrous scale of victims in Chechnya and the spawning of terrorism and then lay out the red carpet, embrace Putin and tell him: 'We're with you, you're the best.' That shouldn't be happening. I understand, our country's a big market, it's very attractive. I understand it very well. But we're not second-class people, we're people like you, and we want to live.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Putin's Russia by Anna Politkovskaya is published by Harvill.

  "Many may not agree with the views expressed by Bob Geldof in his documentaries on marriage and fatherhood aired this week, said Peter Paterson in the <b>Daily Mail</b>, \"but anyone concerned about the rotting corpse that much of today's TV has become should have welcomed his commitment and passion\". There was no welcome, however, from Anne McElvoy. \"Geldof has become Prince Charles, without the pomade and even crosser about modernity,\" she said in the London <b>Evening Standard</b>. \"They have the same droning self-righteousness about what is wrong with society and how it would be all right if only we would see sense, drop the fanciful notions of social progress and listen to their recipe for a better life.\" <p>Geldof's films were \"profoundly influenced\" by his personal experience, said Yasmin Alibhai-Brown in the <b>Independent</b>. Given the \"sad feud\" between him and his late ex-wife, Paula Yates, how could they be otherwise? Yet his \"fundamentalist commandments\" about why marriages fail were troubling. \"Mothers can be drunks and abusers,\" conceded Alibhai-Brown. \"But it is still overwhelmingly men who create terror and violence within relationships.\" </p> <p>The <b>Scotsman</b>'s Jenny Hjul felt that Geldof was ranting when he \"described the removal of children from their fathers as 'state-sponsored kidnapping'\". However, she hoped \"his conclusion that men are just as good at bringing up the kids as women will resonate throughout the land and the handful of fathers at the school gates with be joined soon by a throng of others ... Then, when men and women truly do have equality in the home, there will be no more need for laws which protect the interests of children by giving them to the mothers.\" </p> <p>But it was the inequality created by the law that Geldof was arguing against, countered Amanda Platell in the Mail. \"The inescapable truth is that law has not reflected one of the most fundamental changes in the past 50 years - the way in which men's roles have changes and adapted,\" she said. \"Modern dads do not only have the desire to raise their offspring, but the ability to do so. Yet the law decrees that when a couple divorce, in the majority of cases the children stay with the mother ... How is it fair or equal?\"</p>",
  "<p>Eliot Spitzer, the battling New York attorney general who took on Wall Street, yesterday turned his sights on the insurance industry, accusing it of widespread corruption.</p> <p>The allegations were made in a lawsuit filed against the largest insurance broker in the United States, Marsh &amp; McLennan. The suit also names some of the biggest insurers, including Chubb, American International Group, ACE, Hartford Financial Services and Munich Re, and Mr Spitzer said separate civil or criminal actions could be pursued against each of them.</p> <p>The suit alleges that Marsh &amp; McLennan steered unsuspecting clients to insurers with whom it had lucrative payoff agreements. He also said the broker solicited rigged bids for insurance contracts to make it look as though it had sought the best offer. The result is a distorted market and higher insurance costs, the suit claims.</p> <p>\"This investigation is broad and deep and it is disappointing,\" Mr Spitzer said - disappointing because of what it \"once again reveals about the craven disregard for ethics and the law in some of our largest corporations\".</p> <p>Two unnamed insurance executives from AIG and one from ACE have pleaded guilty to criminal charges in connection with the scheme, the attorney general said.</p> <p>Mr Spitzer has cast himself as a crusader aiming to clean up corporate America. He wrung $1.4bn from the biggest banks on Wall Street to settle allegations that the banks' research departments were issuing conflicted advice to in vestors. He has also extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the mutual fund industry in an ongoing investigation into corrupt practices that favour big clients over ordinary investors.</p> <p>More recently he has turned to the drugs industry and exposed GlaxoSmithKline's suppression of negative data about its anti-depressant, Seroxat.</p> <p>The complaint against Marsh alleges that the firm has \"at least since the late 1990s\" received special payments from insurance companies above and beyond normal sales commissions. The payments, known as \"contingent commissions\", were characterised as compensation for \"market services\" but were in fact rewards for the business that Marsh steered their way, Mr Spitzer said. Marsh collected $800m in contingent commissions in 2003 alone, more than half its $1.5bn profit.</p> <p>Mr Spitzer said the allegations went to the heart of the way the insurance industry does business. \"The insurance industry needs to take a long, hard look at itself,\" he said. \"If the practices identified in our suit are as widespread as they appear to be, then the industry's fundamental business model needs major corrective action and reform.\"</p> <p>Shares across the industry were mauled on Wall Street. Marsh shares fell more than 17% on the announcement, tumbling $7.83 to $38.30. AIG was 11% lower in mid-day trade and ACE dropped more than 8%. Marsh, AIG and ACE had no immediate comment. Hartford denied any wrongdoing and said it was cooperating with the investigation.</p>",
  "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the new European commission president, was warned yesterday that MEPs would vote out his entire commission unless he backed down over his choice of Rocco Buttiglione as the EU's new civil liberties chief. <p>Martin Schulz, the leader of the European parliament's Socialist group, said he could muster a majority among the 732 MEPs for the move, which would provoke a constitutional crisis in the EU. </p> <p>Mr Buttiglione, an Italian Catholic and opponent of gay rights, was rejected by the European parliament when he was presented to a commission that had to ratify his appointment. He had said during the hearing that he considered homosexuality a sin, and that marriage was intended \"to allow women to have children and to have [the] protection of a male\". </p> <p>Under pressure from his backbenchers and spurred by the unprecedented public repudiation of Mr Buttiglione by G\u00f6ran Persson, the Swedish prime minister, Mr Schulz said: \"If [Mr Barroso] repeatedly shows me and the parliament the cold shoulder and there's no change in the justice portfolio, I would recommend that my group reject him.\" </p> <p>He demanded that Mr Barroso explain himself before parliament. </p> <p>The Socialist leader, whose group numbers 200 MEPs, believes he can count on the support of 88 liberals and 175 Greens, Communists and independent eurosceptics if Mr Barroso refuses to meet the parliament halfway by stripping Mr Buttiglione of his portfolio and offering him another post. </p> <p>The crisis put more pressure on the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, but in Italy Mr Buttiglione was receiving support from some who saw him as a potential martyr to \"political correctness\". </p> <p>In a front-page article for the Corriere della Sera, the commentator Ernesto Galli Della Loggia said he could not decide whether the reaction in Brussels was more \"ridiculous or chilling\". </p> <p>The Vatican view is that being gay is not sinful, but that homosexual acts are immoral and unnatural. </p> <p>Vittorio Messori, who wrote a best-selling book with Pope John Paul, said Catholics had joined \"smokers and hunters\" as the new pariahs. In an article for the daily Il Messaggero, he added: \"Thank God anti-semitism has passed, but it has been replaced in western culture by anti-Catholicism.\" </p> <p>As the row continued, Mr Berlusconi learned that he was coming under further pressure from the EU's court of justice. The advocate-general, Juliane Kokott, said Italy's judges should ignore a law that led to the dropping of false-accounting charges against Mr Berlusconi two years ago. The trial that gave rise to the charges is still being heard. </p> <p>In one of the first acts to be passed by parliament after Mr Berlusconi took power with an outright majority three years ago, the government pushed through a change in the law making it effectively impossible for anyone to be convicted and jailed for false accounting. </p> <p>The law has been repeatedly criticised as a licence for swindlers, particularly since the Parmalat scandal. </p> <p>Ms Kokott said that the law failed to meet the EU's requirement for legislation that was \"effective, proportionate and dissuasive\". She added: \"Where a more lenient criminal law adopted after the event is incompatible with the requirements of Community law, the national courts are obliged to give priority to the application on Community law\". </p> <p>The judges hearing Mr Berlusconi's case are unlikely to act until there is a full ruling from the European court of justice, which is expected within six months. The ECJ is not obliged to follow the advocate-general's advice, but usually does.</p>",
  "<p>If a back catalogue of heartbreak and misery are the credentials for a soul singer, Terry Callier is well qualified for the job. Born in the Chicago projects, Callier has had a lifetime of broken dreams. </p> <p>His 1965 debut, The New Folk Sound of Terry Callier, with its tinges of folk and jazz and state-of-the-nation lyrics, is one of the great 60s soul albums, but a series of bad breaks meant that it remained obscure until the early 1990s when Callier, by then working as a computer programmer at the University of Chicago, was discovered by a new generation. The setbacks began at the age of 17 when his mother told him that, rather than become a superstar on the legendary Chess label, he had to stay at home and revise for his exams.</p> <p>\"I started in doo-wop groups when I was about 12,\" says Callier, who seems to have used the experiences of his troubled life to build wisdom rather than bitterness. \"And what set the best ones apart was that they wrote their own material. Some of the poetry was fantastic: the Moroccos had a song called Bang Goes Your Heart and the Eldorados had Crazy Little Mama, and they're just beautiful; I still listen to them today. They made me realise that you have to be original.\"</p> <p>Callier spent his lunch periods at high school singing in the bathrooms, principally because the marble walls created a nice echo. \"I remember like it was yesterday the time the guys in the group let me sing This Is the Night by the Cool Jets, after a year of being in the background. Some guy stopped me half way and said: 'Why are you trying to sound like somebody else? Just try and sound like you .' That was the most influential thing anyone ever told me.\"</p> <p>By the time he was 17, Callier joined Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters at Chess records after taking an audition. He went in the following Monday to make a recording and by Saturday his debut single was a hit. Leonard Chess asked Callier to join Etta James and Muddy Waters on a Chess tour of America, so he went home to pack his suitcase. That was when his mother stepped in. \"I didn't say anything to her apart from 'pass the mustard' for a week or two, but in retrospect she made the right decision. At that age, I would have done everything to excess.\" Three years later Callier was at college, where he was exposed to the folk music explosion that hit America in the early 60s. \"A guy in the dorm room had a guitar and he was always teaching me songs. So I went down to a coffee house in Chicago, and soon I was playing Wednesday through Sunday at that coffee house and having the time of my life. So I had to go to my mum again and say: 'Now I'm really not going back to school.' This time she said OK.\"</p> <p>Alongside Bob Dylan, Fred Neil and a local folk singer called Bob Gibson, Callier was discovering John Coltrane, who had just released his free jazz album A Love Supreme. \"He was playing at a little club called McKees, and I got there early to see Elvin Jones nailing his drum kit to the floor. Then the quartet rocks on stage, and I wasn't prepared for the intensity with which these guys threw themselves into the music - I had never seen men do that before in my life and it frightened me. It made me realise that everything in life was in this music: the beautiful and the ugly, the godly and ungodly. Not everybody wants to touch those places because there are things we have to forget in order to live with ourselves, and that music didn't let you have any secrets.\"</p> <p>Callier recorded his album, The New Folk Sound, under the influence of Coltrane, using two upright basses and two acoustic guitars to create a unique sound. The record would probably have been a hit but for the fact that its producer, Samuel Charters, took the tapes of The New Folk Sound on a voyage of self-discovery into the North American desert, where he lived with the Yaki Indians for the next three years. The album was finally released on Prestige in 1968, and Callier only knew about it after his brother saw it in a Chicago antiques store. \"I went in, bought the album, and took it home. Then I decided to make another go of it.\" Callier kept making records and touring until 1983, when he received a call from his 12-year-old daughter. She told him that she was coming to live with him in Chicago, so he gave up showbusiness for the job with the University of Chicago. \"I didn't touch a guitar from 1983 until 1988 because I was just too busy. Then in 1991 I got a call from a guy in London called Eddie Pillar, who ran a label called Acid Jazz. He told me that he had been playing my records in clubs and he wanted to re-release them and get me playing in England again. So for the next few years, I came over to do gigs in London in my vacation time from my day job.\"</p> <p>In 1998 Callier's album Timepeace won a United Nations award, which meant that his employers at the University of Chicago finally learned about his double life. After picking up the award in New York, he came into work to discover that he had four hours to clear his desk. His new album, Lookin' Out, marks the latest stage in what has happened in his life since then. \"After all that had happened over the years, I wasn't looking to be a musician again because I had got used to having that pay cheque every two weeks. I've been inspired by Billie Holiday and Miles Davis, and I think that Hank Williams was a genius, but those people were never going to do anything but make music and live that life. That's not me. If I hadn't lost my job, I wouldn't be here now.\"</p>",
  "Even now, the White House - or at least one room, the Lincoln bedroom - is being redecorated for President Bush's second term. The famous long bed will remain; so will the original Emancipation Proclamation in its glass case. But, dominating the room, above the bed, will be placed a large carved crown from which will flow, ceiling to floor, royal purple satin drapes. The crown has been sent to be gilded with gold in anticipation of Bush's triumphant return from his campaign. <p>Bush began the TV debates with John Kerry ahead in the polls. After grimacing his way through the first debate, he corrected himself by maintaining strict control of facial muscles in his second. Then after he channelled his boiling emotions into hot-headed belligerence, he recast himself for the third debate with fixed grins however grim the subject. It was his best performance, and the best he could do ... and not good enough. </p> <p>The final debate focused on Bush's weak point, the home front, where he lagged on every issue. On the debate's eve, polls revealed that the voters want a change in direction, a new president, but remained tentative about Kerry. On that soft ice, despite the dead heat, the incumbent could prevail by asserting his mastery. </p> <p>Bush's story is only of the \"war president\". As he tells it, September 11 leads him in a straight line to invade Iraq, and \"freedom is on the march\". True or not, it is a simple story that many can follow. But his narrative of the \"homeland president\" is a melange of avoidances and denials. Chronology is crucified, cause and effect stood on their heads. Under his aegis, nearly one million jobs have been lost, the worst record since the Great Depression; he has squandered the largest surplus and created the largest deficit; more than 4.5 million have lost their health insurance and more than 45 million are uncovered; and so it goes on. </p> <p>But in Bush's telling, for example, his regressive tax, source of much of the deficit, passed before September 11, was enacted afterward. He mentioned as little as possible his Medicare prescription drug bill, despised by most of the elderly, who will pay more - a bill approved only because the Medicare actuary was threatened with dismissal should he tell Congress the true cost. (The twisting of information and intimidation on the Medicare bill are similar to the distortions and coercion in the rush to the Iraq war.) </p> <p>Bush attempted to change the subject to his fictional version of his education bill, \"Leave No Child Behind\", evidence of \"compassionate conservatism\". Asked by the moderator whether he favoured an increase in the minimum wage, he hailed his achievement on education, but never responded to Kerry's factual addition that Bush had failed to secure the $28bn needed to implement the measure. Nor did Bush acknowledge that many states have filed suits in federal courts against \"Leave No Child Behind\" due to the absence of funding, or that the original sponsor of the bill was Senator Edward Kennedy. Instead, he used Kennedy as a straw man. \"There's a mainstream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank,\" the president charged. \"As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.\" </p> <p>Kerry's performance, consistent with previous ones, disclosed his knowledge of policy and toughness - and refuted the negative image projected by the Bush campaign of him as flip-flopper. He too raised the icon of Kennedy - this time John F Kennedy - to establish his credentials on Bush's supposed high ground, the cardinal virtues of faith. </p> <p>After Bush skirted the question of whether he would appoint supreme court justices who would uphold Roe v Wade, the decision legalising abortion, Kerry defended women's right to choose as a \"constitutional right\", defended gay rights, and passionately defended the minimum wage. And then he said: \"I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. Throughout my life this has made a difference to me. And as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, 'I'm not running to be a Catholic president. I'm running to be a president who happens to be Catholic.' My faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There's a great passage of the Bible that says, 'What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead.'\" </p> <p>Haunted by his father's defeat, Bush's presidency has been a case study in reaction formation. He marched to Baghdad, ensured he had no enemy to his right, and cut taxes regardless of the deficit. In the last debate, he sputtered about \"a liberal senator from Massachusetts\", repeating attack lines from his father's old campaign and coming full circle in pursuit of the gilded crown. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@ yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@ yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "Canada's hockey arenas have never had a reputation as forums of political unrest. So when Montreal fans began systematically booing the US national anthem last year before the teams took to the ice, there was clearly more to it than just a few troublemakers voicing their discontent. <p>Our feelings towards the US, and not just towards the powers that be in Washington, had officially changed. The general hostility towards the Bush administration's warrior politics had taken on a downright anti-American look.</p> <p>Admittedly, this was Quebec, a rebel, nationalist, francophone province. Commentators expressed a feeling of shame at this politicisation of a purely athletic contest. Nothing of the like had ever happened in Toronto or Vancouver.</p> <p>But the poll we are publishing today tells us that throughout Canada, our opinion of the US and its president is sinking. This is especially true in Quebec, where 76% of respondents said their opinion of the US had worsened over the past two or three years, but even in Canada 64% said the same.</p> <p>This does not mean quite the same thing here as it would in Madrid or Berlin. At first sight, indeed, no country is as American as Canada except - possibly - for the United States.</p> <p>We drive the same cars, live in the same homes, wear the same clothes, see the same movies, commute from the same suburbs, shop at the same Wal-Marts and, if we are Anglo-Canadians, watch the same television and read the same magazines. We felt close to the trauma on September 11 2001. New York is just next door. Thousands of Canadians know people who died that day.</p> <p>Everything would seem to contrive to bring the two countries together, including our common border, the longest in the world: 90% of Canada's population lives within a three-hour drive of our neighbour to the south. Both countries are each other's main economic partner.</p> <p>Yet history has made us profoundly different from one another: one out of four Canadians, and four out of five Quebecers, are francophone; and the Queen of England is still our head of state.</p> <p>Our socio-political culture, too, sets us apart. It is most unlikely that any Canadian prime minister in the last 35 years would ever have been elected in the United States - except possibly in Vermont or Minnesota, two Northern States that have, over the years, produced such un-American things as maple syrup and hockey players.</p> <p>Jean Chr\u00e9tien, who was prime minister from 1993 to 2003, was in favour of gay marriage, opposed to the death penalty, a staunch defender of a universal free healthcare system entirely controlled by the state, and a proponent of rigorous weapon control - basically, far too leftwing to ever make it as a US Democrat.</p> <p>So it comes as no surprise that many more Canadians have a favourable opinion of John Kerry (55%) than of George Bush (29%) - even more so in unionised, social democratic Quebec, where 71% favour Kerry while only 11% favour Bush.</p> <p>Much more significant is the fact that the US reputation as a prime example of democracy has weakened considerably: 59% of Quebecers no longer view the US as a model, and 36% of respondents in the rest of Canada agree with them. More than two-thirds (70%) of those questioned in Quebec believe that the US does not contribute to world peace, as do 47% of Canadians in general. The vast majority of Canadians (85%) also think that the USA exerts too much influence in international affairs.</p> <p>That much said, despite occasional spurts of vaguely anti-American nationalism, Canadians are well aware of what they owe to their southern neighbours: their prosperity and the defence of their continent. All Canadians consider it important or very important to maintain good relations with the US: 89% of Quebecers believe so, as do 95% of respondents in Canada as a whole.</p> <p>It wasn't an easy matter for Canada to oppose the war in Iraq, and it may well prove very difficult to oppose the latest anti-missile shield project. In a country whose army relies on second-hand submarines that catch fire at sea and on helicopters with a history of killing those soldiers who still dare to fly in them, we aren't in much of a position to throw our weight around on the military scene.</p> <p>Canadians like to think of themselves as a fiercely independent people. They reserve their right to boo if they so please - and to be Americans in their own way, if and when it suits or pleases them.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Yves Boisvert is a columnist with La Presse in Montr\u00e9al</p>",
  "The Japanese view of the United States is complicated by the history between the two countries and what many see as the two faces of America. <p>Since the end of the second world war, the Japanese have admired the United States as a champion of democracy and freedom. But there is another view of the United States as a bully with aggressive policies that puzzle, even anger, Japanese people.</p> <p>In general, as the latest public opinion poll shows, most Japanese hold a favourable impression of the United States. Close to 90% of the respondents said the Japan-US relationship was important, while 74% said they \"liked\" or \"somewhat liked\" the United States. This concurred with a an Asahi Shimbun poll in April 2002 where a high number of respondents said they either felt \"a great deal of\" or \"some\" closeness to the United States.</p> <p>For many Japanese, the United States, seen as the apostle of democracy after the second world war, is still a favorable and amicable nation that provides numerous opportunities, even for baseball players like Ichiro Suzuki and Hideki Matsui.</p> <p>But for some, the United States is also the nation that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the economic superpower that has demanded increased imports from the United States by using the veiled threat of sanctions.</p> <p>Specific US policies, particularly ones perceived as overly aggressive, bring about a more complex appraisal among Japanese. Only 16% in the latest poll said \"the Iraq war was right\". More than four times as many respondents - 71% - said \"the war was wrong\".</p> <p>The Iraq war was also a factor in why many Japanese dislike the US president, George W Bush. The support levels were 30% for Bush and 51% for Senator John Kerry.</p> <p>While the poll results showed that the average Japanese likes the United States, public opinion is divided over whether Washington's actions are actually contributing to peace and the war against terrorism. While Japanese may accept Mr Bush's criticisms of terrorism, they cannot support a war in which many civilians have been killed.</p> <p>Recent history shows that when the United States is magnanimous and heading towards harmony, the Japanese attitude toward the United States is also stable. President John F Kennedy was held in high esteem by many Japanese because he was a symbol of a united America.</p> <p>But after September 11 2001, terrorist attacks and the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the United States became more divided. Americans continue to bicker over such issues as how to engage Islam, how to cooperate with the United Nations and how far to listen to the arguments of allies opposed to the Iraq war, like France and Germany.</p> <p>The antagonism within the US has cast a shadow over Japanese attitudes towards the country - and has influenced opinions on Japan's own leadership. The prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, has faced strong criticism for his unwavering support for the US.</p> <p>Koizumi has used his close ties with Bush as a pillar for his administration, but only 33% of the respondents viewed that stance favorably, compared with 53% who disapproved. Close to 60% of the respondents also opposed Japan's dispatch of the self-defence forces to Iraq. Respondents showed they are dissatisfied with Koizumi simply tagging along with Bush.</p> <p>Yet, Koizumi appears to have ignored the complexity of Japanese public opinion. He has continued to back Bush without adequately explaining his stance to the Japanese public. That is a major reason why many Japanese are dissatisfied with their prime minister. Distrust of the United States and policies concerning Iraq has even spread to Japanese policymakers.</p> <p>\"Pro-American Iraqis and terrorists only represent a handful of the Iraqi population,\" said a Japanese diplomat. \"The remaining large majority are simply law-abiding citizens. The United States seems to have determined that by wiping out terrorists the Iraqi public will fall in line, but its actions are actually pushing those citizens towards an anti-American position.</p> <p>\"The United States should realise the limits of a policy relying only on force.\"</p> <p>The US presidential election is entering its final month. The Republican and Democratic parties have made the election a choice between Bush and a continuation of the Iraq policy or Kerry and a major shift.</p> <p>The poll also showed that support in Japan for the ruling Liberal Democratic party and for the opposition Minshuto (Democratic party of Japan) was finely balanced. But it is still unclear if these parties can create a true two-party system in which policies are at the forefront and not over shadowed by defections, mismatched alliances and power struggles among individual politicians and party factions.</p> <p>One thing that Japan can learn from the United States is the dynamism of its politics.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Hiroshi Hoshi is senior staff writer for the Asahi Shimbun newspaper</p>",
  "Danielle Beccan's mother spoke yesterday of how she cradled her dying daughter in her arms and told her she loved her.

Police think she was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p> <p>Four of five men questioned in connection with the murder have been released without charge; magistrates have allowed detectives to question the fifth for a further 36 hours. </p> <p>Mrs Platt, 32, told the Nottingham Evening Post how, alerted by her daughter's friends, she ran to where she lay, metres from their home. </p> <p>\"I knelt beside her. She was closing her eyes. She said she felt like she was dying. I said, 'Just stay awake, stay awake'.\" </p> <p>She died a short time later in hospital, after one last, brief exchange with her mother. \"I said, 'I love you',\" recounted Mrs Platt. \"She said, 'I love you too, mum.'

  "At least two of Spain's celebrity chefs were reported yesterday to have paid tens of thousands of euros in extortion money to the Basque separatist group Eta. <p>The reports, carried by Spanish news agencies and newspaper websites, said Juan Mar\u00eda Arzak and Pedro Subijana had complied with demands by an Eta extortion racket known as the revolutionary tax. </p> <p>Two other well-known chefs, Karlos Argui\u00f1ano and Mart\u00edn Berasategui, were also reported to have been approached by the group, which has killed more than 800 people over 30 years. </p> <p>It was not clear yesterday whether Mr Argui\u00f1ano or Mr Berasategui had paid. </p> <p>The four chefs, all Basques, have eight Michelin stars and two daily television shows between them. </p> <p>Mr Arzak and Mr Berasategui each have a three-star restaurant in a Basque town - the former in San Sebastian and the latter in Lasarte. </p> <p>An alleged Eta member arrested in the series of raids that also caught the group's leader, Mikel Albizu, last week has reportedly admitted acting as an intermediary in the payments. </p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Luis Beotegui claimed he had been asked by Mr Arzak to negotiate a reduction in the \u20ac72,000 (\u00a350,000) payments that he and Mr Subijana had been told to make, according to the Europa Press news agency. </p> <p>Mr Beotegui, who is related to Mr Arzak by marriage, allegedly told police that Mr Arzak and Mr Subijana had paid half the money in a single payment, providing the rest in instalments over six years. </p> <p>The payments were reportedly given to Mr Beotegui, who said he also posted Eta extortion demands to Mr Argui\u00f1ano and Mr Berasategui but did not collect money from them. </p> <p>El Mundo newspaper's website reported yesterday that a judge was investigating whether any of the chefs had broken the law. </p> <p>Staff at their restaurants said yesterday that neither Mr Arzak nor Mr Subijana were available for comment. </p> <p>Asked by El Mundo about the reports, Mr Berasategui said: \"All I like doing is cooking and working.\" </p> <p>Mr Argui\u00f1ano \"does not know anything about this matter, nor has he anything to say about it\", according to his production company.</p>",
  "The Kremlin is increasing its stranglehold over political debate in Russia by getting pro-presidential deputies to introduce laws making it harder for smaller political parties to register. It also plans to increase the role of key officials of the president, Vladimir Putin, in party politics. <p>Pro-Kremlin MPs yesterday proposed a bill that would change the rules for registering political parties. </p> <p>According to the bill, a party can only be registered if it has at least 50,000 members nationwide. </p> <p>Previously, a party needed more than 100 members in half of Russia's 89 regions, but it will now need 250 members in every region - and more than 500 in half of them. </p> <p>The bill was proposed by three parties which dominate the Duma: the pro-Putin United Russia party, the equally loyal Liberal Democratic party and the nationalist Rodina party. Together they command at least 296 of the 450 seats in parliament - more than enough to pass the law. </p> <p>Parties who do not satisfy the new rules will be denied registration and have to exist as \"social organisations\". This would impact primarily upon the smaller parties, such as Yabloko. </p> <p>Its politics is popular among the 20% of the population considered liberal, but it failed to gain enough votes to win any MPs during December's elections. </p> <p>Political analysts said the new rules allowed the Kremlin to decide which parties could exist. </p> <p>Masha Lipman, from the Carnegie Moscow Centre, said the number of parties in parliament would \"now be up to the Kremlin minders\". </p> <p>\"If they decide they want just two parties, and that one of those is liberal, then they can have a liberal party,\" she said. </p> <p>Rodina, one of the proponents of the bill, was created by the Kremlin just months before the last parliamentary elections and has just less than 40,000 members. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said yesterday the party would not be affected by the bill as it anticipated having 4 million members by the end of 2005. </p> <p>It was the fifth major change announced since the Beslan school siege last month, in which 344 people died. </p> <p>Mr Putin has introduced plans to personally appoint regional governors, to ensure MPs are appointed to parliament only according to the proportion of votes their party gets, and for the Kremlin to appoint judges. </p> <p>Ms Lipman said: \"Once you have opted for this system rather than one with checks and balances, there's nowhere you can stop.\" </p> <p>On Wednesday, the Duma rushed through a bill that permits senior members of the government to hold leading roles in a political party. At present, senior officials have to relinquish their party posts in order to serve in the government. </p> <p>The move comes amid widespread speculation that the Kremlin is trying to find a way to let Mr Putin remain as leader after his second term expires in 2008 without having to amend the constitution to allow presidents to serve a third term. </p> <p>One popular theory being discussed is that the Kremlin could create a parliamentary republic in which Mr Putin becomes leader of United Russia, and prime minister, and a loyal figurehead is appointed to the weakened post of president.</p>",
  "I have been with my partner for four years. I'm 40 and have a teenage daughter; he is 45 and has two young boys. We do not live together, mainly because he is afraid of losing his independence. Though he says he adores me, he is still married. We met when he had separated from his wife and I assumed he would soon divorce. When I raise the issue, he says it is between him and his wife to decide when to divorce and that there are financial implications (they own a house together). I feel it is my concern and I worry there are underlying causes for his reluctance to dissolve the marriage.

The initial phase of testing will ascertain if firewalls, anti-virus software and disk encryption systems fulfil the manufacturers' promises before the Claims Test Mark is awarded. This will help government departments and local authorities make informed decisions based on a product's security, integrity and ease of use. There will be no mandatory requirement to buy tested products, and the results of the programme will also be made available to the private sector.

  "The US presidential contest is set to be the first billion dollar election in political history. <p>According to the latest official figures, George Bush and John Kerry together have raised more than $500m, double the previous record set by Mr Bush and Al Gore in 2000. </p> <p>Allies and surrogates operating through a loophole in the campaign finance laws have amassed a further $330m and are still rapidly sucking in cash, most of which will be thrown into the Bush-Kerry duel in the form of attack advertisements. </p> <p>Add in the $150m in federal funds provided to the candidates, and the considerable funds spent on the presidential contest by the Republican and Democratic party machines, and it is clear that a once unthinkable financial benchmark - the equivalent of more than \u00a3558m - has fallen by the wayside. </p> <p>\"It's fairly safe to say now that the billion dollar mark is going to be passed,\" said Derek Willis, an expert on money in politics at the Centre for Public Integrity, a Washington watchdog group. \"The combined total for the two of them is more than I ever thought two candidates would raise.\" </p> <p>Not only is this the most cash-drenched presidential battle ever, it is also one of the most closely contested, in money terms as well as electoral support. </p> <p>Republican candidates normally outspend Democrats by large margins. This year, President Bush has raised more money than any candidate before him, but Senator Kerry has stayed in contention. The Democratic challenger has collected more than $236m, against the president's $264m. </p> <p>Furthermore, this time Mr Kerry has well-financed allies, liberal support groups whose expenditure does not show up in the official figures and who are easily outspending their conservative counterparts. </p> <p>\"Last time Bush had twice the money Gore had. This time they're close enough that money isn't going to make any real difference,\" said Larry Noble, the head of an independent monitoring organisation, the Centre for Responsive Politics. </p> <p>The Democrats have the president partly to thank for their unusually full pockets. Fury at the Bush administration among wealthy liberals including the billionaire financier George Soros, the insurance magnate Peter Lewis, and leading Hollywood moguls such as Stephen Bing (best known for being the father of Elizabeth Hurley's son) has opened some fat wallets. </p> <p>As one Democratic fundraiser put it: \"This is a nasty and even campaign, so people are coming out and spending more money. The Howard Dean campaign [in the Democratic primaries] galvanised the angry people, and there is one thing that angry people will do. Angry people will write cheques.\" </p> <p>This year's flood of political contributions is the perverse consequence of a legislative attempt two years ago to curb the influence of corporate money on American politics. </p> <p>The McCain-Feingold law, promoted by two senators from either side of the political divide, outlawed \"soft money\" - big money contributions to the parties which escaped federal limits as long as the adverts they funded were about \"issues\" rather than candidates. In practice, it was clear what side a soft money ad was on. To compensate, the law doubled the legal limit on \"hard money\" individual contributions to the campaigns to $2,000. </p> <p>Consequently, both campaigns have raised far more hard money, but the flow of soft money has not been staunched. Instead of going to the parties, it has gone to political groups known as \"527\" committees after a clause in the campaign finance rules which allows \"independent' organisations to raise unlimited funds with few restrictions, as long as they do not formally coordinate their activities with the parties. </p> <p>Democrats were the first to see the huge potential of the loophole, and leading liberal figures set up an array of anti-Bush 527 groups. For example, Harold Ickes, a former aide to Bill Clinton and a veteran Democratic strategist, helps run the Media Fund, which has run a series of scathing anti-Bush advertisements. Jim Jordan, Mr Kerry's former campaign manager, has become the chief spokesman for America Coming Together (Act), which sponsors ads and mobilises liberal voters. </p> <p>The Republicans argued that it was absurd for Mr Jordan, who had only months before had been running the Democratic challenge, to claim he had no knowledge what the Kerry campaign was doing. </p> <p>\"He'd have to have a lobotomy to avoid violating the law,\" Ed Gillespie, the Republican chairman, complained. </p> <p>Since it became clear that the federal election commission was not going to ban 527s, the Republicans have been scrambling to catch up. </p> <p>Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a virulently anti-Kerry group, has produced blistering adverts questioning his war record. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Tom Synhorst, a longstanding business associate of Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, set up a pro-Bush 527 called Progress for America. Within four months it has raised more than $32m, almost as much as Mr Ickes' Media Fund achieved in twice the period. </p> <p>It has been helped by $5m cheques from Republican backers including Roland Arnall, the head of Ameriquest Capital, an investment fund, and Alexander Spanos, the owner of an American football team, the San Diego Chargers. </p> <p>The 527 groups are likely to be the most significant institutional legacy of this election. They are likely to become powerbrokers, complicating the political scene and ensuring that, whatever the rules, big money has its say.</p>",

  "<p>The US has Houston as its oil capital and the UK has Aberdeen. Wherever you go in the town, there are signs of the oil industry that has driven the economy of this town for over 30 years. Trucks drive through the city centre transporting lengths of chain as a thick as a child's arm and piles of steel hawsers: both used in the heavy industrial business of extracting oil from below the seabed. </p> <p>Although the Texans are proud of displaying their wealth with shiny skyscrapers and swaths of swanky suburbs, signs of prosperity are harder to find in Aberdeen. The streets are lined with branches of the Co-op rather than designer names. It may be the fact that Britain's oil reserves are in decline that has resulted in Aberdeen's parsimony. But those involved in the region's oil industry are resolutely upbeat. </p> <p>About 30bn barrels of oil have been pumped from Britain's oil reserves, says Mike Tholen of the UK Offshore Operators' Association. But there remains a further 30bn - so only 50% of the reserves have been exploited. </p> <p>It may seem counter-intuitive, but it is the maturing of the oilfields that is driving the growth of Aberdeen. While the oil majors are not always interested in squeezing the last drop of oil from their fields, there are many smaller operators that specialise in extracting oil from mature fields. </p> <p>\"There are many more players on the market today than there were ten years ago,\" said Jim Atack, managing director of Petrofac - an oil service company. The new players are either US companies who are transferring their expertise of managing mature fields in the Gulf of Mexico to the North Sea or British independent companies . </p> <p>The development of service companies like Petrofac has made it possible for the smaller operators to develop the mature oilfields - known as brownfields, said Mr Atack. \"The smaller operators do not have the necessary manpower to develop the sites alone which is where we service contractors come in.\" </p> <p>Pumping oil is not as easy as simply sinking a well. Crude oil is usually found in a large flat layer of porous rock. Although it is easy to remove the oil around the drill site, extracting more oil from the remainder of the reserve can be tricky. </p> <p>To overcome this problem, oil companies will use other technological tricks, such as horizontal drilling and injecting water or gas to drive more oil out of the rocks. But these techniques are costly. </p> <p>Alex Kemp, professor of petroleum economics at the University of Aberdeen, thinks conventional wisdom on the future of the North Sea is too gloomy. \"Current forecasts underestimate future possible production.\" </p> <p>The main difference between Professor Kemp's estimate and others, is the amount of incremental oil that could be produced - in other words the exploitation of the brownfield sites. </p> <p>With the price of oil having rocketed by 73% since the beginning of this year to over $50 a barrel, this could be seen as a significant incentive for extracting the black stuff. \"Oil companies are used to the price being highly volatile so are very cautious about what price they use to decide where to invest,\" said Mr Atack. </p> <p>The oil community is thought to be using a price of only $20-$25 a barrel to assess where to allocate capital in developing new wells. \"There is a feeling that the supply and demand curve has changed forever and higher oil prices are here to stay,\" said Mr Atack. </p> <p>Higher prices will certainly encourage further development of brownfield sites, since it means that companies' margins will remain healthy despite the higher extraction costs. </p> <p>But a key to the success of the smaller companies is whether they can access the infrastructure of the North Sea. After all, there is little point in extracting gas or oil if there is no way of getting it back on shore. And the oil majors control the infrastructure. \"In the past, negotiations between the smaller oil company and the oil major about access to the pipeline have caused projects to be delayed,\" said Professor Kemp. It is hoped that a new code of practice will put an end to that. </p> <p>In the future, the owner of the asset and the user will negotiate in good faith for six months. If they cannot reach an agreement after that, then the Department of Trade and Industry will be able to intervene and could approve an appropriate tariff. </p> <p>Another initiative which has been welcomed by smaller oil companies is a new licence that gives companies access to parts of the sea floor but at a lower price and for a shorter period of time than traditional licences. The companies will then have a chance to prospect the site and decide whether to develop it. </p> <p>Mr Atack is cheerful about the longer term future of Aberdeen. \"I think the higher oil price and developments in technology will encourage an increasing number of players into the market,\" he said. Developments in subsea technology will make a material difference to oil companies. Connecting oil wells on the seabed and even partially processing the oil will make life easier. </p> <p>Remote monitoring of offshore platforms and the increasing sophistication of the service industry as it matures will also contribute to future growth. </p> <p>The message from Aberdeen is clear - our overall oil reserves may be in permanent decline but there is still plenty of money to be made and no need yet for despondency.</p>",
  "Parliament has a problem. Once seen as the forum for national debate it is now seen as out of touch. This perception is reinforced by the tightening of security following the September 11 attacks, the Fathers4Justice demonstration in the public gallery and the pro-hunt invasion of the chamber. <p>It has become more difficult for members of the public to come into parliament. Twenty-five years ago you could walk in without a pass and the serjeant at arms' staff were there to direct you to where you wanted to go rather than to check you for security purposes. This first began to change in response to the IRA - and it has sharply increased with the threat of al-Qaida. </p> <p>Now it's not only more difficult to get inside the building, but parliament looks more remote behind large concrete barriers and with the visible presence of armed police. Once inside parliament if they go into the chamber public visitors must sit behind a glass screen and they are checked on their way into and out of meetings or committee sittings. This is all, clearly, necessary. But we need to take account of the effect that it will create in the public's mind and try and redress it.</p> <p>On top of that, the government's large majority and a relatively ineffective opposition means that some see parliament as a rubber stamp for Tony Blair. This reinforces the sense of distance between the public and parliament. Parliament is seen as \"there for the government\", not \"there for me\".</p> <p>In some respects this is more perception than reality. Almost without exception, MPs now work much harder in their constituency than used to be seen as necessary. It used to be the case that while those with small majorities worked hard in their constituencies - those with large majorities would sometimes not even \"visit\" for long periods of time. Now, even those with large majorities go out of their way to see as many of their constituents as possible as often as possible - actively seeking them out rather than just waiting till they are asked for help.</p> <p>And the select committee system - created in 1979 - provides, irrespective of the size of a government's majority, a robust system of accountability. </p> <p>There's also the longstanding but growing problem of young people in particular feeling out of touch with parliament. This despite the fact that there are a number of very young MPs, who won their seats while still in their 20s. For example Claire Ward, the Labour MP for Watford who was elected in 1997 at the age of 25 and is PPS to John Hutton at the Department of Health, Labour's David Lammy MP, who was 27 when he won his seat in 2001 and Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather, who won in Brent East last year at 29. But that is not how it is seen - so we must address the perception.</p> <p>I suggest that we consider the following measures in addition to the proposals in the Select Committee on Modernisation of the House of Commons report, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmmodern/368/368.pdf\">\"Connecting Parliament with the People\"</a> (pdf)</p> <p> <b>1. Writing to your MP or a minister should be Freepost</b><br> Ministers can write to anyone without paying - so can members of parliament. Yet if anyone wants to write to us they have to pay. This is wrong. We need to hear from our constituents and the public at large, and they should not have to pay. This would not only be a good practical measure - it would symbolise the acknowledgement among parliamentarians that we need to be constantly in touch with the public and we want to hear from them. On the basis of the cost of this measure where it operates in New Zealand, I estimate this would cost \u00a3456,471 per annum. There is also a parliamentary freepost scheme in Canada.</p> <p><b>2. Parliament should be an 0800 freephone number.</b><br> The public know that organisations that want you to be in contact with them have a freephone number. If you are prepared to take the trouble to call your MP you should not have to pay for the \"privilege\" - rather, parliament should be prepared to pay because it wants to hear from the public.</p> <p><b>3. All MPs should make written annual reports to their constituents</b><br> Many do this already. Most MPs tend to reply to individuals who write in about with their views or problems. At election time we put out literature including an election address which all candidates can send Freepost. But these are only once every four years and they inevitably focus on the party's plans for national government rather than exclusively on the candidates' plans for their work as constituency MP. An annual report would be an annual opportunity for the MP to state clearly to their constituents what they have done in the past year and what they plan to do. That is what all other accountable organisations do. People's confidence in parliament is increased if they know what their MP has done, know what they plan to do and have the chance to give feedback on those plans.</p> <p><b>4. Select Committee meetings - when taking evidence in public - should be held outside the palace of Westminster</b><br> The best venue would usually be a local authority town hall. Mostly select committees meet in the House of Commons when they are taking evidence. These sessions are public. But the public area can seat no more than on average 20 in most of the committee rooms. When there is a controversial or particularly interesting hearing, there will be even fewer places for the public once the press and departmental advisers are seated. </p> <p>From time to time select committees have sat outside Westminster. Usually this is where they need to go to a particular part of the country to take evidence - rather than to create the opportunity for the public to see their work. </p> <p>When the international development select committee, under chairman Tony Baldry MP, took evidence from a panel of Sierra Leoneans living in London, for their report on Migration and Development (2003-4: HC 79-1) they held the hearing in Southwark town hall in Peckham. Before the select committee formal hearing began, the six members of the committee attended an informal reception at the town hall and mingled and had discussions with many of the 200 attendees who then filled the council chamber and public gallery to hear the formal evidence session.</p> <p>In the audience's response to particular comments of the six Sierra Leoneans giving evidence, (ie loud applause) the select committee were able to tell which comments had particular resonance with the wider Sierra Leonean diaspora and were backed by particularly strong feeling. All of the 200 attendees were able to see a session of a parliamentary committee at work. This would not have been possible if the session had been held at Westminster. <b>5. All MPs should be expected to teach citizenship classes in their local secondary schools</b><br> The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority can assist by developing teaching materials for the hour long class and follow-up which can be undertaken with the class by the teachers at the school. I have taught hour-long citizenship classes in three of my local secondary schools (Waverley Upper School, Sacred Heart School and Walworth School) which involved a brief talk about the responsibilities of an MP, broke them down into groups to do work on political issues (e.g. draw up a manifesto and then present it to the others in the class) and have the opportunity to ask a wide range of questions. This not only will help young people understand the work of parliament but also help MPs understand the needs and concerns of young people.</p> <p>Obviously these proposals are not the be-all or end-all all of what needs to be done to reconnect parliament to the British people. Politicians need to continue listening to the concerns and ideas of their constituents. I'm determined to continue the debate about this important issue and would be grateful for all comments and suggestions.

  "<p><strong>VOTES GETS VOGTS OF CONFIDENCE</strong></p> <p>The Fiver still remembers the exact moment it thought Berti Vogts might be a half-decent manager. It was 4.49pm, November 8 2003, and Scotland had just beaten Holland 1-0 in the first leg of their Euro 2004 playoff. (Needless to say we were so legless that, were she still alive, Princess Diana would probably have visited us in hospital.) Since then, sadly, Scotland's dreams have flopped faster than Fran Healy's Hoxton fin/career, culminating in last night's 1-1 draw in Moldova - a team ranked 113th in the world - and predictable calls for Berti to get the chop.</p> <p>\"Guatemala and Zambia are ranked higher than us now,\" fumed Gordon McQueen, his face turning a purpler shade of Sir Alex. \"We have not qualified for a major championships and yet he says 'judge me on major championships'!\" Meanwhile an \"utterly embarrassed\" Ally McCoist sobbed: \"Where was the spirit? Where was the passion? Why have we just been fortunate to get away with a point from Moldova? If there are answers to these questions, then Vogts doesn't have them and he must go - now.\"</p> <p>However SFA chief executive David Taylor has stuck two fingers up at all the critics, claiming: \"We're not in the market to be looking for a manager.\" And even though the Scottish FA will hold a meeting to discuss Vogts' future next week, Taylor is holding firm. \"It is a difficult job being Scotland manager at this moment,\" he gruffed, adding: \"Had we won last night we would have been back amongst the pack. It shows how narrow the line can be between success and failure.\" And how huge the line is between reality and fiction at the SFA, some might say.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>WILL BRUCE PLAY HIS CARDS RIGHT?</strong></p> <p>Free GBP10 bet for first time users on Saturday's Birmingham v Man Utd match:</p> <p><a href=\"www.bluesq.com/fiver\">www.bluesq.com/fiver</a> </p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"This team has no football.

  "One of two men arrested in connection with the theft of a woman's remains from a graveyard is a prominent animal rights protester, it emerged today. <p>The Coventry Animal Alliance said that John Curtin, 41, was arrested by Staffordshire Police this morning at his home in the Hillfields area of Coventry. </p> <p>A second man, aged 34, was taken into custody in Wolverhampton at about 6.30am, as part of the inquiry into the desecration of the grave in Yoxall of Gladys Hammond, who died aged 82.</p> <p>Officers have suggested that animal rights extremists may be responsible for digging up the remains. Mrs Hammond's son-in-law helps to run a farm breeding guinea pigs for medical research and her family has been repeatedly targeted by animal rights activists.</p> <p>The damage to Mrs Hammond's burial plot was discovered last week at St Peter's Church in the Staffordshire town. The area was cordoned off for a forensic investigation and police later announced that most of her remains had been removed. </p> <p>It is thought that at least two people were involved in digging up the grave, under cover of darkness between last Wednesday night and Thursday morning. </p> <p>Alliance member Nancy Phipps, whose daughter Jill was crushed to death under a lorry during a protest against live animal exports at Coventry airport in 1995, confirmed that Mr Curtin, a former surveyor, was arrested early today. But she accused officers of conducting a \"fishing expedition\". </p> <p>Mrs Phipps, who is in her 60s, told the Press Association: \"John's door was knocked down this morning despite the fact he has had nothing to do with the Newchurch protest. The police are just on a fishing trip. It's pretty obvious they have not got a clue who is doing these things. </p> <p>\"John is well known in the movement and he's a campaigner and a good speaker, but I can assure you he won't be charged because he's not involved. </p> <p>\"He has converted to Buddhism and he's a gentle person. He's a close friend of all my family and he has not got anything to do with what happened.\"</p> <p>Mrs Hammond, who died in 1997, was the mother-in-law of Chris Hall, one of two brothers who run Darley Oaks farm in Newchurch, Staffordshire. </p> <p>The Hall family have been subjected to a long-running campaign by animal rights activists, suffering hate mail, malicious phone calls, hoax bombs, a paedophile smear campaign and arson attacks. </p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Nicholas Baker, describing the incident as \"a quite despicable act\", said on Tuesday he was keeping an open mind about whether the desecration was the work of animal rights protesters. </p> <p>A police spokesman said: \"In a pre-planned operation between Staffordshire Police and West Midlands Police this morning, officers have arrested two men. Warrants were executed in Wolverhampton and Coventry, resulting in the arrest of a 41-year-old man in Coventry and a 34-year-old man in Wolverhampton. The men were taken to police stations in Staffordshire, where they will be interviewed. Officers are currently conducting searches and forensic tests at the addresses.\"</p>",
  "Israel is set on a collision course with the EU and could turn into a pariah state, on a par with South Africa during the apartheid years, if the conflict with the Palestinians is not resolved, Israel's foreign ministry has warned. <p>In a confidential 10-year forecast obtained by the Associated Press, the ministry's Centre for Political Research said the EU is pushing to become a major global player in the next decade, and that as a result the US, Israel's main ally, could lose international influence. If the 25-member EU overcomes internal divisions and speaks in one voice, its global influence would grow considerably, and be more in line with its powerful economy, analysts wrote. Europe is Israel's major trading partner.</p> <p>Up to now, Europe has divided on major foreign policy issues, such as the war in Iraq. A more united and influential Europe would likely demand greater Israeli compliance with international conventions and could try to limit Israel's freedom of action in its conflict with the Palestinians, the document said. Israel might also have to pay a price for growing competition between the EU and the US. Israel-EU relations have long been shaky, and Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom has repeatedly warned that Israel has to work to strengthen ties with Europe. However, Israel also accuses the Europeans of pro-Palestinian bias, and complains of a growing wave of anti-Semitism in parts of Europe. </p> <p>EU officials in Brussels said that while the EU and Israel have sound relations in the areas of trade and scientific research, they have very definite differences of opinion over the Palestinians. </p> <p>\"Regarding the Middle East peace process and our relations with Israel and the Palestinians, there is no doubt that the role of the EU has increased,\" said Christina Gallach, a spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana. </p> <p>The EU says Israel's planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005 must be followed by major troop withdrawals in the West Bank, and pave the way for Palestinian statehood. \"None of this is exactly what the Israelis want to hear, but we have to say it,\" Ms Gallach said. </p> <p>She added that the Israeli government wants to broaden the relationship with Europe without giving the EU a bigger role in resolving the Middle East conflict. </p> <p>The EU's ambassador to Israel, Giancarlo Chevallard wrote on the legation's website that when it comes to the conflict, Israel \"tends to keep Europe at arms length and prefers to place all its eggs in the American basket.\"</p> <p>According to the Foreign Ministry document, which was written in August, Israel could become increasingly isolated in the coming years if Europe becomes more influential. </p> <p>\"In extreme circumstances, this could put Israel on a collision course with the European Union. Such a collision course holds the risk of Israel losing international legitimacy and could lead to its isolation, in the manner of South Africa,\" according to the document. </p> <p>Even if the EU fails to become a major international player, Israel will still become increasingly isolated if it fails to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians, according to the document. The best possible outcome - that the Middle East conflict moves toward solution - would still not put Israel and the European Union on good terms, the document said. \"In almost every scenario, there is the potential for friction in Israel-EU relations,\" the analysts wrote. </p> <p>Ron Prosor, the director of Israel's Foreign Ministry, said Israel is investing a great deal in improving ties with the EU, especially in economic areas. </p> <p>\"The situation is not easy, but there is an investment here, especially in Europe, that is important to us all,\" Prosor told Israel's Army Radio. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he will limit the number of Muslim worshippers to 50,000 at Islam's third holiest shrine, the Haram as-Sharaf or the Temple of the Mount as it is known to Jews, because of safety concerns.</p> <p>Israeli police and archaeologists have said a corner of the sacred hilltop should be roped off to prevent it from collapsing during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts tomorrow and draws large crowds to pray at the shrine. </p> <p>Authorities have said an eastern retaining wall of the compound was weakened by an earthquake in February and it is shifting.</p> <p>However, Muslim officials are refusing to meet Israel's demands, which include roping off part of the site and have quoted engineers from Jordan and Egypt as saying the shrine is safe. The chief Muslim cleric of Jerusalem, Ikrema Sabri, has accused Israel of exaggerating the danger in order to gain greater control of the site.</p> <p>Israel captured the site in the 1967 war and retains overall control of the site while Muslims run it. The site is plagued by controversy and it has been claimed the second intifada was started when Sharon, then opposition leader, visited it in 2000. In other developments today, Israeli tanks and bulldozers pulled back from the Gaza Strip town of Beit Lahiya today, after tearing up roads, flattening strawberry greenhouses and knocking down walls of dozens of houses in what residents said was the most devastating raid in four years of fighting.</p> <p>The two-day foray into Beit Lahiya was part of a major Israeli military offensive in the northern Gaza Strip, now in its third week. As part of the latest fighting, five Palestinian militants and an elderly civilian were killed in three separate missile strikes, starting yesterday evening. </p> <p>Israel says the campaign is aimed at halting Palestinian rocket fire on Israeli towns. Palestinians say much of the destruction is wanton. </p> <p>Since the September 29 start of the campaign, triggered by a deadly Palestinian rocket attack on an Israeli town, 105 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli army fire, including dozens of militants and 18 children and teens under the age of 16. </p> <p>Despite the heavy army presence in northern Gaza, Palestinian militants have continued to fire rockets and mortars at Israeli border areas and Jewish settlements in Gaza. Israeli military commentators wrote today that while an offensive might appease Israeli public opinion, it would not stop rocket fire. </p> <p>Sharon told parliament's defence and foreign affairs committee in a closed-door meeting that the offensive would continue as long as Israelis were being harmed, Israel Radio said.</p>",
  "<p>The Press Association's Northern Ireland staff were today forced to find emergency accommodation after their Belfast offices were destroyed in what the fire brigade said was the biggest fire to hit the city in years.</p> <p>The four-storey listed building, which also houses branches of Waterstones and Abbey, caught fire in the early hours of this morning. Police have launched an investigation into the causes and do not believe there was anyone in the building when the fire started.</p> <p>PA staff were today working out the office of the Belfast Telegraph until more permanent accommodation could be found.</p> <p>\"Our first priority will be to sort out some sort of temporary emergency accommodation.

  "The Women's Institute's 220,000 members were mobilised today to save Britain's streets from clutter in a joint campaign with the government's heritage agency for better public spaces. <p>WI volunteers will be hitting the streets with clipboards to carry out audits of unnecessary signs, obtrusive road markings and useless street furniture.</p> <p>These \"clutter audits\" will be delivered to local authorities all over the country in the next few weeks. They are part English Heritage's Save our Streets action plan to change the chaotic appearance of Britain's roads, high streets and squares.</p> <p>Launching the plan, Barbara Gill, chairwoman of the National Federation of Women's Institutes, said: \"Our members will be carrying out street audits and letting councils know that local people want their streets back.\"</p> <p>She added: \"We want streets designed to encourage walking and cycling, which are barrier free, accessible to everyone and pleasant places to be.\"</p> <p>Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, added: \"Our historic streets are being trashed by thoughtlessness and cheap design. Some of the worst culprits are local authorities which should be setting an example of enlightened stewardship.\"</p> <p>He explained that more than 20 different agencies are able to install equipment and signs in the streets without any control or coordination. </p> <p>The best-selling travel writer Bill Bryson is also backing the plan. He said: \"We are setting out to restore dignity and character to England's historic streets, largely by removing the blight of unnecessary signs, poles, bollards, barriers, hotchpotch paving schemes and obtrusive road markings under which they are fast disappearing.\"</p> <p>As part of the campaign, English Heritage today launched a CD-rom to highlight what it calls the \"crisis of clutter\". It also set up a dedicated Save Our Streets website, which includes a guide on how to carry out a \"clutter audit\". </p> <p>In addition, it has pledged to work with the Department of Transport to develop streetscape manuals for every region. And it also be running workshops for highway engineers and urban planners aimed at securing \"decluttered\" streets.</p>",
  "<p> It's only the first hand of my Guardian poker challenge and already I have a tight decision to make. I'm holding the three of clubs and the four of diamonds, normally a junk hand to be discarded without a second thought. But the flop - the three community cards - is potentially a monster: it's four, four, five, all of different suits. I'm sitting on a three-of-a-kind, potentially a big hand. Online has given me $360 (\u00a3200) of stake money and we could be off to a flyer. </p> <p>The player to my right bets $8 into the $8 pot. It smells like a bluff: I don't believe he's got the other four. I call, planning to move in for the kill on the next round of betting. Then comes the counter-punch: a player to my left raises to $32, an aggressive move at these stakes. Suddenly my big hand looks a big problem. </p> <p>What to do? The first player instantly folds, confirming my suspicion he had nothing. But the raiser clearly has something. Should I call? Or re-raise, say to $64, and see if he blinks? </p> <p>Except this game of no-limit Texas hold'em is being played in cyberspace, albeit with real money deposited by credit card. If my opponent blinks, he could be blinking in front of a laptop in Lyon. Maybe he's dancing around his kitchen in Kansas because his pair of fives has made him a full house. If so, my set of fours is virtually dead. Nor do I like my chances if he has an ace or another high card with the four I'm now convinced he's got. </p> <p>\"You have 10 seconds to respond,\" flashes the message from the virtual dealer at pokerineurope, a site run by British bookmaker Victor Chandler. Online poker is played at speed and 30 seconds of thinking time is generally the maximum. I opt for discretion and fold. </p> <p>Maybe I was bluffed, but I don't want to jeopardise my Guardian bankroll that easily. Be patient, I tell myself, and better opportunities will come. </p> <p>In this, I like to think I am playing in the conservative manner of Lee-Anne Smyth, a 25-year-old mathematics graduate from Belfast who has created a sensation in the world of online poker by claiming to be averaging \u00a34,500 a week at Ladbrokes' poker site. That's \u00a3200,000 a year, even with six weeks' holiday. </p> <p>Reactions to her claim have ranged from \"good on ya\" to hostile disbelief. I think her story is just about believable. Poker on the internet is populated by wildly over-aggressive and rash players. You would be hard-pressed to guess that the point of Texas hold'em, the dominant and most subtle form of poker, is to be sufficiently skilful to minimise the element of chance. </p> <p>Smyth's style seems perfectly designed to exploit the excesses. She has been described as \"a rock\" - an ultra-tight player who will usually only raise when she has a strong hand or \"the nuts\", the best possible hand. It requires patience and I am told Smyth often reads a book to help her through her nine-hour stints . </p> <p>My patience is rewarded just two hands later. I am dealt a pair of queens and raise to $20. One player calls and this time the flop really is a thing of beauty - four, seven, queen, two of them spades. I have a three-of-a-kind again and this time it is the best possible hand at this moment. </p> <p>I bet $25 and am stunned to find my opponent bets his entire stack of $70. I make the easiest call in the world and the cards are turned over. He is chasing a spade flush and the odds dictate he will win this situation a little less than one time in three. Happily, this is not one of them. I collect the $175 pot and the Guardian is showing a $90 profit after four minutes of play. </p> <p>These are the joys of poker, a game that has been transformed by the internet. Exact figures are hard to establish but the website operators calculate that about \u00a320m a day is wagered in Britain alone, hardly a country with a strong poker tradition. It is reaching unexpected places. Charities dealing with gambling addiction talk of bored housewives logging on for their mid-afternoon fix of hold'em. Students are thought to be a prime source of new players, too. </p> <p>Nobody would applaud such social trends, but it is hard to see how they will be reversed. The internet poker revolution is spreading back into mainstream media, with Sky covering tournaments with large prizes and celebrity participants. This relationship was demonstrated last year when an American player called Chris Moneymaker - a genuine surname - won the big one at the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, scooping a prize of $2.5m. He had qualified via a $40 internet tournament. </p> <p>My introduction to the game was via Channel 4's Late Night Poker series a few years ago. Under-the-table cameras, enabling the viewer to see the hidden cards, provided a stunning demonstration of the card-reading skills of top players. I had to give it a go, and the internet was the obvious place. There is only one bricks and mortar card room left in London's casinos but at Ladbrokes' poker website, you will find at least 3,000 players logged in at any time of the day or night. </p> <p>Pokeroom, another site that promotes itself heavily in Britain, says it is Sweden's 19th most profitable company and, again, the claim is credible. Poker sites take a rake from each real-money pot - typically 1% to 2% - and it adds up. Ladbrokes' site, for example, has dealt 100m hands in less than three years. </p> <p>After the early success for the Guardian poker fund, the cards run cold. Mostly, I am dealt junk - and when I do get decent cards, the other players fold into my raises. After an hour's play, $90 profit has been whittled back to $50 and patience requires real effort. </p> <p>Another half hour passes before I get some action. I am dealt ace-king of the same suit, a favourite hand because it is easy to play: raise and, if an ace or king hits, bet big; if not, slow down. </p> <p>Two players call my $10 bet and the flop brings the king of diamonds plus the jack and five of clubs. I bet $30 and a player - an 18-29-year-old male in Glasgow, according to the factfile that is available if I click on his name - re-raises me another $40. </p> <p>I call, worried he has a pair of jacks. The turn brings another five and he bets $60. I call again and now there is $289 in the pot. The last card is the 10 of hearts and I am relieved to see my opponent from Glasgow check, his first sign of weakness. I check behind him and the cards are exposed: my ace-king beats his king-queen and the fund is now $159 to the good. Dollars being the currency of the internet, I set a mental target of $180 for a clear \u00a3100 profit. </p> <p>There is no fear that the money will fail to arrive from Gibraltar, the low-tax haven of Victor Chandler's computer servers. I have been playing online for two years or so and my winnings have always arrived promptly and accurately via a deposit back to my credit card. </p> <p>Nor am I concerned by the recent scare stories about robots, armed with sophisticated computer programmes, fleecing the innocent. I don't believe it would be possible in a full-handed game of no-limit poker, involving nine players, dealt two cards each at random. Poker is not like chess or backgammon, where all the pieces and counters are exposed. </p> <p>The bigger worry is two or more players colluding via telephone. I have seen a few suspicious situations, and the only sensible response is to move tables and ask the website operator to investigate. The sites are making so much money they have an incentive to ensure the game is clean. </p> <p>The final push to reach $180 takes an age and is preceded by another slow slip back down the ladder. On the crucial hand, I am lucky enough to find an opponent \"on tilt\" - betting wildly after a series of losses. Poor old \"lalaa\" has blown about $500 in the past 15 minutes and now he or she is trying to bluff me out of a $300 pot when my queen-jack of clubs has made a full house. </p> <p>It has taken almost two-and-a-half hours to make a profit of $190, even with that blistering start. I have mostly been playing two tables simultaneously, which means I have played about 250 hands but my profit has been generated largely from just three of those hands. If that sounds like a grind, you'd be right. Online poker can be dull and an hour or two is usually enough for me. </p> <p>If, on the other hand, you want to give it a whirl, do the sensible things. Play on a site run by a reputable operator and start at the \"play money\" tables for beginners. Before you even think of risking real money, read some books on poker strategy and odds. If they make no sense, don't do it. Smyth and her like are waiting for you. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send comments to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@guardian.co.uk\">online.feedback@guardian.co.uk</a>.

  "A small group of protesters demonstrated outside the high court today, on the eve of their appeal against a ruling that police acted lawfully in turning their bus away from an anti-war rally. <p>In March last year, about 120 activists were travelling in three coaches to the RAF Fairford airbase in Gloucestershire to protest against the US-led war in Iraq when police stopped the group and searched them.</p> <p>Officers found numerous items including masks, spray paint, two pairs of scissors, five shields and a smoke bomb and determined that the protesters posed \"a real risk of a breach of the peace\". The buses were sent back to London under a heavy police escort.</p> <p>The high court ruled in February that while Gloucestershire police had acted unlawfully and breached their human rights by detaining them, the officials were legally allowed to turn them away from the demonstration.</p> <p>Jane Laporte, from Fairford Coach Action, a group of around 80 passengers on the bus pursuing the case, said the police were chipping away a protestors' rights.</p> <p>\"The police do this often on demos where they will use a grey area of the law to try and stop us from doing certain things.

  "<p>\"I confess that I've never watched a presidential debate in an atmosphere so reminiscent of a pro wrestling crowd.\" So writes John Hinderaker of the pro-Bush <a href=\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/\">Powerline </a>blog. He was at the Minneapolis Hilton last night, along with the people behind <a href=\"http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/\">Captain's Quarters</a> and <a href=\"http://www.shotinthedark.info/\">Shot in the Dark </a>and others in the \"patriotic\" camp.</p> <p>If you ever wondered what a party of bloggers sat round a table in a hotel ballroom looked like now is your chance to <a href=\"http://powerlineblog.com/archives/008179.php\">check out the photographs</a>.</p> <p>In terms of style and presentation, the last debate was closer than the previous two. Mr Bush had ditched his sometimes petulant air for warmth and charm, and, in some of the answers at least, Hinderaker felt he had something to cheer for. \"For me, the defining moment came near the end, when moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS asked the candidates an open-ended question about religion. Bush's answer was perfect: straightforward, inclusive, heartfelt.\"</p> <p>But he still hesitates to put it in the win column for the president. \"On the whole I thought that Kerry did somewhat better than Bush on the ordinary domestic policy issues. He was almost always on the attack and was better able to back up his arguments with (often misleading) data. On the other hand, Bush did better than Kerry on the 'social' or 'values' issues.\"</p> <p>The same analysis is shared by Andrew Sullivan's <a href=\"http://www.andrewsullivan.com/\">Daily Dish</a>, a blog moving away from the president with some reservations. Even so, his \"<a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_10_10_dish_archive.html#109772584733900818\">big surprise</a>\" is that Mr Kerry won the exchanges on fiscal discipline, guns and immigration. \"I sat slack-jawed as I watched Kerry clearly seem tougher on illegal immigrants than Bush! This is Bush's big weakness with his base.\"</p> <p>Those at the pro-Kerry <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/\">Daily Kos</a> are delighted by the instant or near-instant polls that cast the encounter as a tie or a clear win for the senator (set out on <a href=\"http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/index.php\">Donkey Rising</a>). The site even wonders if Mr Bush is repeating the <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/10/14/05153/514\">mistakes Al Gore made in 2000</a> by turning up to each debate with a different persona. First he was \"Haughty George\", then \"Furious George\" and finally \"Class Clown George\", cracking jokes as he went. \"Who's the flip flopper? Who was rock-steady all three debates?\" asks Kos.</p>",
  "<p>As a child, Shen Wei studied calligraphy - which may explain why the dancers in his Rite of Spring make patterns as if the world depended on it. The work is performed on an abstract floor painting and, watched from above, Shen wields his own choreography like a paintbrush. He drips, spatters and spools the movement around the stage - sometimes stilling his brush to elegant doodles, sometimes stabbing it in savage blots and angry lines.</p> <p>The dancers themselves are white faced, almost anonymous in their dark clothes but although Shen has deliberately sidestepped the narrative in Stravinsky's score, they look anything but blank. With their arms pressed to their sides, their faces timidly averted or blindly panicked, they seem to dance in a world too big for comprehension. Even when the choreography breaks into violent falls or swerving leaps the dancers look driven by forces beyond their choosing.</p> <p>This sense of collective need is underlined by the unstoppable fluency of Shen's phrase making. Even the choreography's fiercest moments it doesn't falter in elegant pattern making, nor yield to the crushing down beat of Stravinsky's score. The 10 dancers skitter over the music's broiling energy as if they were dancing on the thin crust of a volcano, and only their urgently spun steps could hold the explosion in check.</p> <p>It's an extraordinary piece of visual poetry - but what makes it pall is the fact that Stravinsky is all about cataclysm and in Shen's choreography the big moment is always deferred. Paradoxically it's in the infinitely slow, suspended Folding that you get the more satisfying dynamic.</p> <p>Set to a mix of Buddhist chant and John Tavener this creates a different world of ritual. The dancers in their conical skullcaps, look like members of an arcane religious order, dedicated to a life of exquisite movement meditation. As they reach their apotheosis Shen and his fabulous dancers elevate body sculpture to an extreme level of beauty - so beautiful it's almost enough to fill the evening's long empty spaces.</p>",
  "<p>After a strangely subdued first Test, the mayhem expected from this series arrived as Australia felt the heat on a scorching first day in Chennai.</p> <p>After Australia, who won the toss, blazed to 136 for 0 and then 189 for 2, Anil Kumble absolutely shredded them. Starting with the wicket of Damien Martyn from the last ball before tea, he took seven wickets on the spin and effected the run-out that ended the innings.</p> <p>It was absolute pandemonium: Australia collapsed to 235 all out, and though India lost Yuvraj Singh - caught behing slashing at Shane Warne, who thus equals Muttiah Muralitharan as the leading wicket-taker in Test history on 532 - to end on 28 for 1, there is no doubt who is in control after the first day.</p> <p>The day had started so well for Australia, with Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden plundering yet another century opening partnership.</p> <p>But, as is usually the case when Australia play in India, the introduction of the home spinners changed the mood. The stand had reached 136 when Hayden, having already struck two sixes in his 58, was caught by VVS Laxman just inside the long-on boundary attempting to launch Harbhajan Singh over the ropes.</p> <p>Justin Langer (71) went two balls later, snicking Harbhajan to Rahul Dravid at slip, but the ice-cool Simon Katich and Damien Martyn had quietly restored Australia's authority as tea approached. Then, the turning point. Martyn, who made 26, gloved the last ball of the session to short leg, and Kumble was away.</p> <p>Darren Lehmann, essaying an ugly, crooked cut shot, was caught behind without scoring; Michael Clarke was pinned lbw on the back foot by a topspinner, and Adam Gilchrist, lunging forward dangerously on a pitch offering copious bounce for the spinners, walked after bat-padding to short leg.</p> <p>Australia, under excruciating pressure for the first time in the series, found their Indian demons resurfacing, and the tail was blown away in a flash: Warne slapped a return catch, Jason Gillespie was snaffled at short leg, and Michael Kasprowicz also walked - even though David Shepherd had already given him not out and called 'over' - after inside-edging Kumble onto his pad.</p> <p>The denouement of Australia's innings - the ridiculous run-out of Glenn McGrath - reflected the blind panic that had set in. For them, it was all depressingly familiar: none of the bottom seven had reached double figures, and the almighty collapse - ten wickets for 99, seven wickets for 44 - was proof that when the Indian kitchen is at its hottest, their batsmen simply do not have the answers.</p> <p>They know it, all of India knows it, and when the post-mortem of this series is conducted, there is every chance that this will be recognised as the day the momentum changed irrevocably.</p>",

  "Wyndham Lewis may have been one of the most abrasive and caustic figures in British literary and artistic history. But a new exhibition at Somerset House in central London shows the softer side of the avant gardist: the one that got sentimental about a four-leg friend. <p>This hero of British modernism, a literary critic of peculiar viciousness, was capable of melting into a softhearted pulp when it came to his Sealyham, Mr Tut. Lewis depicts it rolling on its back, presenting its stomach for a bit of affectionate tickling. </p> <p>Lewis was notoriously unsparing of others' literary output, launching scathing attacks on former friends such as James Joyce and Ezra Pound.</p> <p>It seems surprising, then, that in 1944, he should have written of his dog that \"this small creature, which stood for all that was benevolent in the universe\" had soothed Lewis and particularly his wife during their sojourn in Canada during the second world war. </p> <p>\"Like the spirit of a simpler and saner time, this fragment of primitive life confided his destiny to her, and went through all the black days beside us,\" he wrote. </p> <p>The exhibition, which opens today, shows that Lewis continued to produce drawings even when he was unable or unwilling to paint in oils, for instance in the 1930s when afflicted with a bout of venereal disease. </p> <p>Among them are works with an unexpected biblical theme and even domestic subjects, such as a wartime drawing of a loaded tea tray. </p> <p>His wife, Froanna, who at the start of their relationship was kept much in the background, also gets a look-in with some affectionate 1930s portrayals. </p> <p>His satirical wit is in evidence. Figures at a Beach House from 1919-20 shows a C\u00e9zanne-like bathing scene. However, a second glance confirms that one male figure is staring intently at another's crotch. </p> <p>Born in 1882, Lewis studied at the Slade and later founded Britain's first truly avant garde artistic movement, the vorticists. He died in 1957.</p>",
  "<p>A lot, some of it salutary. In the 1920s, German scientists correctly picked up on x-rays as a possible source of genetic damage. In the same decade they also launched a huge campaign against tobacco, condemning it as a \"plague\" and \"lung masturbation\", according to Robert N Proctor, the historian, in his book The Nazi War on Cancer. The catch is that these scientists were eugenicists and were worried about the corruption of German germplasm. Smoking, for instance, was \"unGerman\" and a vice propagated by Jews. </p> <p>A decade later, Nazi scientists identified the dangers of organochlorine pesticides such as DDT before anyone else, and launched campaigns to discourage alcoholism. German scientists of the period made the link between asbestos and lung cancer and developed the first high-powered electron microscope. They also pro moted breast self-examination to detect tumours at an early stage. Nazi leaders backed all these campaigns. Hitler was a vegetarian. Heinrich Himmler lectured the Waffen-SS on the importance of vitamins, minerals, whole foods and fibre in their diet. </p> <p>The question arises because the American Medical Association yesterday announced a series of lectures on Nazi medicine at medical schools around the US. The lectures have been organised in association with the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and the collaboration coincides with an American exhibition called Deadly Medicine: Creating the Master Race. </p> <p>Alan Wells, of the American Medical Association, says: \"During the 1930s, the German medical establishment was admired as a world leader in innovative public health and medical research. The question we want to examine is: 'How could science be co-opted in such a way that doctors as healers evolved into killers and medical research became torture?'\" </p> <p>Adolf Hitler spoke of Germany as a body and himself as the doctor who wanted to make the nation healthy by eliminating the diseased parts. This programme of national health began with sterilisation and ended, of course, with six million deaths in the concentration camps. These events left their mark on all medicine. </p> <p>\"We can never forget this history because it continues to affect medical ethics today,\" Wells says. </p> <p>\"For example, one reason doctors today are so concerned about racial and ethnic health disparities is because our codes of ethics demand that we treat every person equally, without regard to race or ethnic background. This ethical obligation is a direct outgrowth of the horrors of Nazi medicine.\"</p>",
  "<p>Because at the moment, the only space agency with a reliable handle on the growing mountain of orbiting space debris - everything from astronauts' dropped tools to splintered rocket casings - is Nasa. </p> <p>But European nations hope to do some counting for themselves, which is why a recent meeting of the European Space Agency in Madrid heard a preliminary estimate of more than 2,500 pieces of space rubbish measuring between 20cm and 25cm across. To stay in orbit, such lumps of polymer and metal must be travelling at 17,500mph or more. So a direct hit from one would be calamitous for a space station, satellite or space tourist. </p> <p>What's up won't come down unless it slows sufficiently to burn up in the atmosphere. Otherwise, it could get some extra kick to shove it into higher orbits, further from the main space traffic routes. </p> <p>In the 47 years since the launch of Sputnik 1, near Earth orbit has become crowded. Occasionally big objects smash into even larger ones and create more space buckshot. Europe has big investments in space, and every reason to protect them. </p> <p>\"Future space systems such as Galileo (Europe's answer to GPS) will be relied upon for safety critical applications such as aircraft navigation,\" says Richard Crowther, of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, and a professor of astronautics at Southampton university. \"Europe needs an independent and comprehensive space surveillance capability to en sure the integrity of such systems in a deteriorating space environment.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, near Earth orbit remains a shooting gallery. The UK got the International Telecommunications Union to agree to dispose safely of telecoms satellites just before the end of their lives by kicking them into a different orbit. Unfortunately, there are reports that operators are ignoring the recommendation because the longer they keep their machines on station, the more profit they make. </p> <p>\"In years to come, we can expect to see the fixed satellite dishes on the sides of people's houses replaced by moveable antennae which have to track satellites that can no longer operate safely in the geostationary ring,\" Crowther says.</p>",
  "Detectives investigating the theft of a woman's remains from a graveyard arrested two men today. <p>Staffordshire police said the suspects were detained at addresses in Wolverhampton and Coventry at around 6.30am, as part of the inquiry into the desecration of the grave in Yoxall of Gladys Hammond, who died aged 82. </p> <p>Officers have suggested that animal rights extremists may be responsible for digging up the remains. Mrs Hammond's son-in-law helps to run a farm breeding guinea pigs for medical research and her family has been repeatedly targeted by animal rights activists.</p> <p>A police spokesman said: \"In a pre-planned operation between Staffordshire police and West Midlands police this morning, officers have arrested two men. Warrants were executed in Wolverhampton and Coventry, resulting in the arrest of a 41-year-old man in Coventry and a 34-year-old man in Wolverhampton. </p> <p>\"The men were taken to police stations in Staffordshire, where they will be interviewed. Officers are currently conducting searches and forensic tests at the addresses.\" </p> <p>The damage to Mrs Hammond's burial plot was discovered last week at St Peter's Church in the Staffordshire town. The area was cordoned off for a forensic investigation and police later announced that most of her remains had been removed.</p> <p>It is thought that at least two people were involved in digging up the grave, some time between last Wednesday night and Thursday morning. </p> <p>Mrs Hammond, who died in 1997, was the mother-in-law of Chris Hall, one of two brothers who run Darley Oaks farm in Newchurch, Staffordshire. </p> <p>The Hall family have been subjected to a long-running campaign by animal rights activists, suffering hate mail, malicious phone calls, hoax bombs, a paedophile smear campaign and arson attacks. </p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Nicholas Baker, describing the incident as \"a quite despicable act\", said on Tuesday he was keeping an open mind about whether the desecration was the work of animal rights protesters.</p> <p>The Conservative MP for Lichfield, Michael Fabricant, blamed the attack on local animal rights extremists. But Sarah Dixon, spokeswoman for the Save the Newchurch Guinea Pigs campaign, said the group had no part in the desecration.</p>",
  "Rwanda, Kosovo, Darfur? Does international law stand in the way of military intervention to stop humanitarian crises occurring or to bring them swiftly to an end? <p>The UN charter prohibits a state from using force in another country without the latter's consent. There are, however, two well-established exceptions: if force is used in self-defence, and if force is authorised by a security council resolution under chapter VII of the charter. </p> <p>The security council may authorise military action only if the measure is necessary \"to maintain or restore international peace and security\". At first sight, a humanitarian crisis within a state's borders would not qualify. But on occasions the council has determined that there was a threat to the peace even if the situation was internal. In 1968, chapter VII was applied against the Ian Smith regime in what was then Southern Rhodesia. More recently, the council has adopted chapter VII resolutions for Somalia (1992), Haiti (1994), Rwanda (1994) and eastern Zaire (1996) and has determined that widespread human rights abuses can amount to a threat to international peace (former Yugoslavia 1993, Rwanda 1994 and East Timor 1999). </p> <p>But what if the security council, for whatever reason, does not adopt a resolution authorising military action, in the face of actual or impending disaster? May a state or a group of states lawfully use force within an unwilling state? The views of lawyers are divided. There is a tension between the rules in the charter, built on a world order that depends on the sovereignty of states, and the rights and needs of individuals. In the west, many believe that there is a legal right to use force in the most extreme cases of humanitarian need - or at least that the law is developing in that direction. It would be harder to find such a view among developing countries. Others consider that though an intervention would not be legal, it would be \"legitimate\". All these views were expressed after Nato countries intervened in Kosovo in 1999. </p> <p>The British government's view was stated by Baroness Symons in a written answer in November 1998: \"Cases have ... arisen (as in northern Iraq in 1991) when ... a limited use of force was justifiable in support of purposes laid down by the security council, but without the council's express authorisation, when that was the only means to avert an immediate ... humanitarian catastrophe. Such cases would ... be exceptional and would depend on an objective assessment of the factual circumstances at the time and on the terms of relevant decisions of the security council bearing on the situation in question.\" </p> <p>This has the merit of underlining that force may be used only in exceptional circumstances; but it doesn't set out its arguments for departing from the UN charter. </p> <p>The genocide convention is sometimes thought to give authority for states to intervene in other countries. It requires states to prevent and punish genocide. But that does not give the legal right to intervene militarily - states must call on the UN \"to take appropriate action\". </p> <p>Regarding the Iraq conflict in 2003, it would not have been possible to claim that the intervention would have stopped imminent massacres, nor that force was the last reasonable option. </p> <p>In the aftermath of Kosovo, a commission was set up to consider the whole question of humanitarian intervention. The Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty reported in 2001, and recommended the use of the term \"responsibility to protect\". This was intended to refocus the debate from the rights of states, to the interests of the victims, while recognising that the primary duty to protect rests on the state concerned. </p> <p>The commission set out six criteria for military intervention for human protection purposes, building on the \"just war\" tradition. There must be just cause (a large-scale loss of life or large-scale atrocities such as ethnic cleansing). There must be the right intention (the primary purpose of the intervention must be to halt or avert human suffering). Force must be used only as the last resort. The means used must be proportionate (the minimum necessary). There must be reasonable prospects of success; force cannot be justified if it makes the situation worse. </p> <p>The sixth criterion was that there must be \"lawful authority\". On the difficult question of whether force may lawfully be used in the absence of a security council resolution, the commission concluded, after extensive consultation round the world, that \"as a matter of political reality, it would be impossible to find consensus ... around any set of proposals for military intervention which acknowledged the validity of any intervention not authorised by the security council or general assembly\". But the commission warned that failure of the council to act when it ought to would pose a serious problem of credibility for the UN. </p> <p> Within the UN, attempts have been made to negotiate a set of guidelines similar to those set out in the commission's report, but those efforts have failed so far. However, the African Union has as one of its principles its right to intervene in one of its member states where there are serious war crimes, genocide or crimes against humanity. </p> <p>What should be the law? A doctrine of humanitarian intervention which leaves to individual states the judgment on the seriousness of human rights breaches is open to abuse. States might camouflage a political agenda behind arguments of humanitarian necessity. The concept of sovereignty is often presented as the obstacle to protection of human rights, but it may be the only protection that a state has against abuse of power by a stronger state. Collective intervention is more likely to be disinterested than single-country intervention. </p> <p>This is a difficult area of law and of international relations. We must hope for wise recommendations from the UN high-level panel on threats, challenges and change set up by Kofi Annan in 2003, which is due to report in December. </p> <p> <b>\u00b7 </b>Elizabeth Wilmshurst was deputy legal advisor to the Foreign Office until her resignation in 2003 over the Iraq war, and is now head of the international law programme at Chatham House.

  "<p>New services to replace GP out-of-hours cover will be regularly audited to ensure the care for patients does not go downhill, the government today promised.</p> <p>Concerns have been raised that the transfer of responsibility for care during the evenings and weekends from GPs to primary care trusts in England will result in patients being denied a chance to see a doctor. </p> <p>But guidelines published today by the Department of Health promise that patients will continue to be guaranteed access to home visits by GPs. </p> <p>Some PCTs have already taken over control of out-of-hours services, with many GPs choosing to opt out of providing cover outside of normal hours under their new contracts. </p> <p>Instead, out-of-hours services are provided by, for example, private sector contractors, ambulance trusts or the primary care trusts themselves. </p> <p>In some areas, patients will be referred to a nurse practitioner who can give advice on their condition over the phone and decide whether they need to see a doctor immediately. </p> <p>Some critics have claimed that the changes already seen in out-of-hours care have led to more patients going to hospital casualty departments. </p> <p>From the end of the year, all PCTs will take over the responsibility of organising out-of-hours services. </p> <p>Health minister John Hutton has published new national quality requirements which set out the national minimum levels of service for GP out-of-hours care. </p> <p>The requirements state that patients will be treated by the clinician best-equipped to meet their needs \"in the most appropriate location\". </p> <p>They also say that \"if there is a clinical need\" patients will be guaranteed a GP consultation, including a home visit. </p> <p>The DoH said services would be regularly audited to \"ensure that patients are receiving quality care\". </p> <p>The national quality requirements will come into force from January 1, replacing current national standards in operation since November 2002. </p> <p>Mr Hutton said: \"Patients are entitled to expect the NHS to provide high quality, accessible and comprehensive primary care services during the evenings and at weekends. </p> <p>\"I am determined that this will continue to be the case once the responsibility for organising out-of-hours services transfers from GPs to PCTs later this year. </p> <p>Dr Tina Ambury, vice-chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said the guidance published by the government should be welcomed.</p> <p>\"The changes to out-of-hours services provide an opportunity for GPs to work with other health professionals to deliver a co-ordinated approach that means patients will get the care that they need from a person who has the skills best placed to meet those needs. </p> <p>\"The onus is now on PCTs to make sure they have GPs in place by December to work in the new out-of-hours teams.\"</p>",
  "<p>The euphoria I felt following my release from prison eight weeks ago after 20 years inside did not last long - and neither did I want it to.

I had anticipated such a reaction - the spontaneous adrenalin rushes that I had been unable to control as my hour of liberation loomed closer had given me plenty of warning of what to expect. That was why I decided to take that first week out off work. I thought that would be enough time to adjust to my new status. </p> <p>I'd planned a week of thinking, reading, walking: relaxing activities that I hoped would allow me to get used to the idea that my days of living the life of a captive really were over at last. What I discovered was that compared to a week in jail, a week on the outside can be a very, very short time. </p> <p>I had been so looking forward to those seven undisturbed days, free from unwanted intrusions and the demands of others. I wanted them to be long, slow days. Seven wet Sundays in a row would have been bliss. In an effort to make them last, I stayed up late and got up early. But it made no difference. Before I knew it the holiday was over and I was back in the office, sitting at my desk, prioritising my to-do list, the preceding week a blur. </p> <p>In fact, in the end I found that I was relieved that the week was over. The stride of so much unstructured time in unfamiliar territory had caught me unawares. Work gave me back the familiar and now included the added bonus of going home when the working day was over, but worryingly, the weeks passed and the pace showed no sign of slowing. It was as if I was a marathon runner who knew he had crossed the finish line but couldn't stop running. </p> <p>If I'm honest, I know that part of me hasn't wanted to stop running. In prison I never had pastimes. Passing the time was the least of my priorities. Turning my life around was so big a task that I became fearful of allowing even an unacknowledged hour to get by me. So I decided I would only ever have \"use-times\". </p> <p>My life was consumed by the determination to become someone who could function well on the outside. Self-discipline was everything; control and focus were my tools. For years I had a note of the words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow stuck up on my cell wall: \"The heights by great men reached and kept, were not obtained by sudden flight. But they, while their companions slept, were toiling upward in the night.\" </p> <p>Not that greatness was ever in my sights. I only wanted to be able. I read about a man who had once achieved greatness, only to end up in a prison cell. Some years after his release he achieved greatness again. This time round he kept a plaque on his desk upon which a quote once paraphrased by the 1920s US president Calvin Coolidge declared: \"Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence, talent will not, education will not. Persistence and determination are omnipotent.\" I copied that out too and stuck it up alongside Longfellow. </p> <p>I guess that once I got to this stage, I was hoping for a happy ending. I think I expected that, with all this control and focus, life outside would just fall into place. I was convinced that the skills I had developed inside were transferrable - and certainly, most have been. That was why I was relatively unfazed by my periods of temporary release from the resettlement prison in which I spent the last couple of years. It was how my employer was persuaded that I would be capable of managing such a responsible job. But something has definitely been missing. </p> <p>Prison officers used to tell me that life outside was hard. For many people it is, undoubtedly. But I cannot say that I am finding it hard, only odd. Although occasionally it is so odd that sometimes it feels as if I'm disintegrating inside. I never wanted it to be easy, just even-paced and manageable. That's what I had prepared for. That was the point. Part of my confusion, I think, is that I can still barely believe that those 20 years are really over.</p>",
  "In a bid to give the rest of the world a say in the US election, the Guardian is urging non-Americans to write to voters in Clark County, Ohio, one of the most marginal areas in a key swing state. To receive the name and address of a Clark County voter, visit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/clarkcounty\">www.theguardian.com/clarkcounty</a>. For the next two weeks we will be publishing letters to Clark County from prominent Britons in G2. <p>I love America and the Americans. I once nearly applied for US citizenship. Normally I would be reluctant to offer an opinion on elections in another country, but having attended the Democratic convention in Boston, and followed the Republicans in New York, I am emboldened to offer some of my American friends a little advice. </p> <p>Perhaps in Britain we do not yet fully understand the impact on the collective psychology of the US of 9/11. But what is essential to keep in mind is that the values of the rule of law, market economies, democratic institutions, and defence and security cooperation are the glue that binds us together. Your British friends are concerned that the rule of law has been abandoned in Guant\u00e1namo, that you seem willing to protect steelworkers and farmers from market forces, and your willingness to adopt a right of pre-emption in security makes us nervous that the multilateralism that sustained America and Europe for so long is, if not being abandoned, at least being severely modified. </p> <p>We admire your patriotism, which is in sharp contrast to the occasionally cynical attitude of the British; but we fear that that powerful force for unity may stray close to arrogance as a result of your military and economic power. </p> <p>Many Britons were sceptical about the decision to invade Iraq, and even those of us who understand the US system fall into the trap of thinking that the White House always speaks for the whole political system. But we know that there are many who shared our doubts on Iraq, and who are subject to the same anxiety about the consequences facing our two nations. </p> <p>It would be presumptuous of us to suggest how you should vote in the elections, but when you do so, please bear in mind that your vote will have overwhelming consequences; not just for yourselves, but for the world, and in particular those who have been your closest allies. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Menzies Campbell is the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC has told senior executives that a full scale sell-off of its commercial arm, valued at up to \u00a31bn, is now firmly off the agenda after hiring bankers to discuss the possibility with major media companies in recent months. </p> <p>The corporation's chief operating officer, John Smith, who is overseeing a wholesale review of the BBC's commercial operations, told a meeting of 400 managers that Worldwide was \"not for sale at the moment\". </p> <p>He said the review was likely to recommend that the BBC hold on to assets that \"had a strategic attachment\" to the broadcaster. These are likely to include the BBC America cable channel and other overseas ventures. </p> <p>But at the BBC management summit yesterday, bosses were told that the other radical plan - to move a significant amount of staff out of London - was still on the cards.</p> <p>Peter Salmon, the head of sports who is leading the reveiw of BBC in the regions, told management that up to 1,700 were going to be moved to Manchester, but exactly what parts of the BBC will move remains to be decided.</p> <p>He promised a decision by early December at the latest with widespread speculation that BBC childrens and BBC3 will be the ones to move north.</p> <p>Mr Smith also said the BBC was open to finding joint venture partners for its resources and broadcasting divisions, which control its studios and outside broadcast divisions. </p> <p>The ITV chief executive, Charles Allen, has already raised the prospect of sharing the cost of joint venture studios in Scotland and the regions with the BBC.</p> <p>The private sector got excited about the prospect of buying parts of BBC Worldwide which publishes everything from Top Gear magazine to The Office DVDs.</p> <p>Its appetite was further whetted when Mr Smith contacted 25 major media groups including Time Warner, Emap, Walt Disney, Telewest, the Discovery channel, ITV and Channel 4, as well as investment banks such as CIBC, Rothschild, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley, to discuss the options for the business. </p> <p>Former BBC Worldwide chief Rupert Gavin stepped down in July after six years at the helm of the unit, which sells the corporation's programmes abroad as well as producing a range of spin-off DVDs, videos, books and magazines. It also holds the BBC's 50% stake in UKTV, its pay-TV joint venture with Telewest. </p> <p>Mr Smith's comments are in line with the thinking of the director general, Mark Thompson, who had already hinted that a full sell-off of Worldwide was unlikely. </p> <p>\"I never either suggested or hinted a wholesale sale is a likely outcome... my test is what will deliver most value in the long term,\" Mr Thompson told the Guardian last month. </p> <p>In particular, he appeared to suggest that the corporation's joint ventures with commercial concerns, Flextech and Discovery, would not be for sale. </p> <p>He called them \"very farsighted, very positive steps... they point the way to the future... Large strategic partnerships of that kind, I can certainly see us wanting to develop those and other ones.\" </p> <p>At the \"Leading the Way\" management conference, top managers were given an update on all the internal reviews currently being conducted at the behest of the governors as part of the charter review process. </p> <p>The review of the commercial operations is due to be completed next month.

  "<b>Iraq</b> <br> The prime minister denied misrepresenting the intelligence on which Britain went to war with Iraq and refused to apologise for the conflict. <p>The Tory leader, Michael Howard, accused Mr Blair of having \"not accurately\" reported the intelligence to MPs and demanded: \"Will you now say sorry for that?\" </p> <p>Mr Blair responded: \"I take full responsibility and apologise for any information given in good faith that has subsequently turned out to be wrong.\" But he added: \"What I do not in any way accept is that there was any deception of anyone. I will not apologise for removing Saddam Hussein. I will not apologise for the conflict. I believe it was right then, is right now and essential for the wider security of that region and the world\". </p> <p>The prime minister urged Mr Howard to stop \"playing politics\" with the issue and trying to capitalise on anti-war sentiment. </p> <p><b>Pensions</b><br> Mr Blair defended the government's record on pensions and pledged to do more after the final recommendations of Adair Turner's pensions commission are published next year. </p> <p>Mr Howard accused the government of losing control of pensions, telling Mr Blair: \"It is time to stop talking and start taking action.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair said the government's means-tested pension credit was a necessary measure to tackle existing pensioner poverty and the best way of helping the worst off pensioners. \"We have, and we make no apology for this, been trying to focus on the poorest pensioners first.\" </p> <p>Later opening a debate, shadow work and pensions secretary David Willetts said the government was \"paralysed\" by endless argument between the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and Mr Blair and had failed to reform pensions or welfare. Pensions were in crisis while ministers argued behind the scenes over whether to scrap means-testing. </p> <p>The work and pensions secretary, Alan Johnson, confirmed pension credit was not intended as an \"indefinite\" solution. He said he was moving towards a \"very positive\" stance on the Liberal Democrat idea of a non means-tested citizens' pension. Mr Johnson rejected the notion that a higher state pension was the solution. \"It's a delusion, mainly because we've got 50% of women who do not even have the national insurance contributions even to get to the level of the basic state pension.\" </p> <p><b>Foundation hospitals</b><br> Foundation hospitals should be scrapped in Britain following failure of the Spanish policy they were based on, Labour's Kelvin Hopkins said. He told Mr Blair the Fundacion Hospital Alcorcon near Madrid had proved a \"disastrous failure\" and was being returned to state control by the socialist government. Mr Blair said he had not seen reports from Spain but was convinced giving hospitals greater freedom was the right way forward for Britain. </p> <p><b>Middle East</b><br> The Middle East will have to wait until after the US presidential election next month before progress can be made in the peace process, Mr Blair said. Liberal Democrat Tom Brake asked: \"Do you believe that the Palestinian and Israeli people can wait until after November and the US presidential elections for the peace process to be revived?\" Mr Blair said: \"The reality is that it is only after the presidential election that the president of the US will be able to focus on it.\" </p> <p><b>Living wills</b> Patients who are unable to communicate could be \"starved or dehydrated to death\" under plans to introduce living wills, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith warned. He called on Mr Blair to give Labour MPs a free vote on the mental capacity bill. Mr Blair pledged to \"look carefully\" into the issue but insisted health ministers told him the bill \"doesn't have the effect you are indicating\". </p> <p><b>Aid workers' deaths</b><br> A British aid worker and his African colleague killed by a landmine in the Sudan were hailed for their \"selfless\" work. Save the Children programme manager Rafe Bullick, from Edinburgh, died when his vehicle drove over the mine in Darfur. Sudanese water engineer Nourredine Issa Tayeb, 41, also died. The international development secretary, Hilary Benn, expressed \"the condolences of the whole house\" to their families. Alan Duncan, for the Tories, added: \"They were unfailingly selfless in the help they were giving to others.\" </p> <p><b>Westminster security</b><br> Work on a new control room and additional CCTV is underway in the Whitehall and Westminster area to boost security outside parliament, the home secretary, David Blunkett, said. </p> <p><b>Anti-social neighbours</b><br> People who have suffered at the hands of anti-social neighbours should be able to vet new tenants, Labour's Stephen McCabe urged. He said \"constant and deliberate\" poor behaviour by some tenants made life \"intolerable\". His tenant obligations and vetting arrangements bill would mean tenants have to sign up to a code setting out their responsibilities. It gained its first reading but stands no chance of becoming law. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br>The chancellor, Gordon Brown, and his ministers face the Commons at question time. MPs debate a European report on the justice and home affairs work programme, Lords amendments to the horserace betting and Olympic lottery bill and school sport. The Lords debates the civil contingencies bill's committee stage and disease control in agriculture and horticulture.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: The final TV debate of the US election, John Prescott's controversial housing plans and a Northern Irish goldrush</p> <p> <b>A SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS</b></p> <p>Two men, one word: sorry. They are both at the top of their chosen professions but there the comparisons between Tony Blair and David Beckham end, as do the parallels between their apologies. Beckham, who provoked outrage when he said he got booked deliberately in Saturday's game against Wales, said: \"I now know that I was wrong\". Mr Blair, speaking on Iraq war intelligence in a stormy Commons, said he took \"full responsibility, and indeed apologise for any information given in good faith that has subsequently turned out to be wrong. What I do not accept is that there was any deception of anyone\".</p> <p>For some people that is not really enough. Step forward, predictably enough, the Independent, which blazes \"A sorry affair\" across its front page. \"Mr Blair and his ministers have treated this torrent of bad news [the Iraq Survey Group report saying Iraq had no WMD, the withdrawing of the 45-minute claim, the murder of Kenneth Bigley] as though it is all rather a pity but nothing disastrous. But how much more wrong can any piece of intelligence be. And how much more wrong can a politician's judgement be if deems such intelligence a reasonable basis for war?\"</p> <p>Simon Hoggart, the Guardian's parliamentary sketch writer, is frankly unsurprised by latest prime ministerial pronouncement. \"Did Tony Blair apologise for the Iraq war? Of course not. Are you mad? ... This is the Tony Blair school of etiquette, in which you say you are \"sorry\" while making it clear a) that you are not to blame, b) that it wasn't your fault, and c) even if it was, you would do the same thing all over again.\"</p> <p>The Mirror widens out its coverage beyond the purely rhetorical and reports in its fourth paragraph that the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, did use what Downing Street insiders refer to as the \"s-word\" to say sorry for misleading the public and Peter Mandelson, another close Blair ally, \"even twisted the knife by criticising the failure to obtain a second UN resolution explicitly backing military action\". The Guardian's leader compares Mr Blair to the king of Swaziland \"accompanied by a retinue of hired praise singers expressing what it would be undignified for the monarch to express himself\".</p> <p>The Sun, for its part, concentrates on the other apology. \"After a girly sarong, painted pink nails, [the Rebecca Loos allegations], THAT penalty, wedding thrones, the latest tattoo, Diego Simeone, the mohicans, the self tans, Posh's knickers ...

The Telegraph's front page pictures a mass grave near the village of Hatra, in northern Iraq, where 300 bodies have been found. Investigators for the special tribunal that will try Saddam and other senior regime figures for genocide and crimes against humanity uncovered one grave containing the bodies of pregnant women and children holding toys. In another trench, men had been herded together and mown down by machine gun. The skeletons are believed to be victims of the 1987 al-Anfal campaign against the Kurds.</p> <p>Other graves found in Iraq, predominately in the south, were excavated by relatives to give the dead decent burials soon after the US-led invasion, but that frequently meant forensic evidence that could be used in the trials was disturbed or damaged. The Guardian adds that the Hatra grave site, near the ancient city of Nineva, is thought to hold the bodies of several thousand people.</p> <p>Exhumation began in Hatra six weeks ago but the Mail raises questions about the timing of the announcement. It quotes an anti-war Labour MP, Bob Wareing, who suggests that it could have given George Bush the benefit of the doubt in his debate against John Kerry. He told the paper that neither Mr Blair nor Mr Bush showed any interest in Iraq in the late 1980s, and that the only present cabinet minister who signed early day motions condemning Saddam's human rights abuses was Alistair Darling. The Sun's report quotes the prime minister \"silencing\" his critics in parliament when he described the mass graves.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1326869,00.html\">Hundreds found in Iraq mass graves</a><br>* <a href=\" http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/14/wirq14.xml\"> Telegraph: Full horror of Saddam unfolds</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004472963,00.html\">Sun: 'Mass killing justifies war'</a></p> <p><b>KERRY v BUSH III</b></p> <p>The third and final US presidential debate finished around 3.30am and so was too late for the British papers, but there is no let up in the coverage of the race. The Guardian reports that one of the Democrats' perennial stars, Bill Clinton, will re-enter the fray and record radio adverts from home as he recovers from his heart surgery. The Independent looks at one of the party's rising stars, Barack Obama, who is so far ahead in his race for an Illinois senate seat - 45% clear of his opponent - that he is moving himself and his dollars into the national battle to campaign for Mr Kerry. The paper says that Obama, almost certain to become the fifth African-American in US history to take up a seat in the senate, could now mobilise black voters to turn out in force for Kerry.</p> <p>Polls put the race at a statistical tie, so voter turnout could become an important factor in the result. Bronwen Maddox, the Times foreign editor, looks at it both ways. A President Kerry could draw a line under Iraq and ask for help to fix the problem but she suggests that Europeans could benefit from a \"quieter and more circumscribed\" second Bush administration \"as long as they don't spoil it by letting their dislike of Bush get in the way\".</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1326828,00.html\">Clinton joins fray as endgame nears</a><br>* <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=571905\">Independent: Rise in black turnout could hurt Bush</a><br>* <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1308721,00.html\"> Times: Europe can win from Bush victory</a></p> <p><b>PRECOTT'S HOUSING PLANS</b></p> <p>The Guardian carries an exclusive report that John Prescott's plans to build 500,000 homes in the east of England will cause a water crisis, threaten landscapes, damage historic towns and destroy wildlife.

The Sun reports that Sven Goran Eriksson hailed him as \"captain fantastic\" but hurriedly added he would not be demoting Beckham anytime soon.

  "The photo above shows Afghan men waiting in line to vote. John Tammes, the reader and US army major who took it, was kind enough to email it to me and give me permission to use it. <p>Mr Tammes writes: \"These men are waiting to vote in Dasht-e Robat (Parwan province). They were very good natured about waiting and they seemed to be proud of what they were doing.\"</p> <p>So they should have been: despite threats of death and destruction from the remnants of the Taliban and al-Qaida as well as many media commentators, they had turned out to vote. The election may not have been perfect - the UN apparently needs a better ink supplier - but international monitors pronounced it fair.</p> <p>As a result, it is getting rather little attention in the western media - because if Afghanistan is obviously not the \"quagmire\" people have been calling it for three years, Bush must have been doing something right. That raises the troubling possibility that he might know what he is doing elsewhere, a notion that must not be entertained - if at all - until after the US elections.</p> <p>The Afghan elections are not the only ones that matter for Bush this week. Australia's John Howard, along with Tony Blair one of Bush's strongest supporters, won what Australia's The Age called a <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/09/1097261864643.html\">\"thumping victory\"</a> over an opponent who had pledged to withdraw from the Iraq coalition, as Spain has. </p> <p>Howard's victory was big, and now antiwar forces have been reduced to claiming that the election had nothing to do with Iraq really. (Just compare these New York Times treatments: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/08/international/asia/08australia.html\">\"War plays a role in elections in Australia\"</a> (pre-election) and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/international/asia/10australia.html?oref=login\">take</a> (post), relegating Iraq to the background. </p> <p>The election was really about the economy, you see. In part no doubt it was - but what would it have been about had Howard lost? I think I know.</p> <p>Like the Afghan elections, the benefit for Bush is largely negative but still very real: had those elections gone badly, there would have been renewed \"quagmire\" talk and claims that the Bush administration was incompetent; had Howard lost many of those now spinning the poll as an economic test would be holding it up as evidence of Bush's unpopularity, the disastrousness of the Iraq war and so on. </p> <p>Instead, the US press is doing its considerable best to ignore these developments or to explain them away. </p> <p>Reporting from Kabul on the <a href=\"http://techcentralstation.com/101204C.html\">\"prevailing attitude\"</a>, Scott Norvell quotes a regrettably typical comment from an American reporter in this part of the world. \"At least it's news,\" the journalist said of the Afghan election scuffle over the weekend. \"Otherwise this is just a success story.\" God forbid.</p> <p>But that is what it was: a success, no matter how hard the international media tried to spin it. There were no car bombs raining body parts all over the polling stations; there were no last-minute assassinations; there were no drive-by shootings. </p> <p>The best they could come up with for \"news\" was grumbling from hopelessly trailing opposition candidates about washable ink and threats of a boycott. The media's disappointment was palpable. </p> <p>I hope for more such disappointments in the future, for while Bush is the winner in these events, he is not the only one.</p> <p>Mr Tammes emailed me last week after the opening day of an Afghan girls' school. He wrote: \"What better way to get ready for the historic presidential election here than to ... open a girls' school. </p> <p>\"The people here are interested in the election, and all have told us how wonderfully different it is to be involved in choosing a leader. </p> <p>\"However, security concerns regarding the election and such will not get in the way of their fierce determination to provide a better life for their kids - not by one day. School repair or construction is the number one request for assistance we get.

  "<p>Vodafone picked a successor to long-time finance chief Ken Hydon yesterday and restructured its board in an effort to give chief executive Arun Sarin more operational control of the mobile phone company. </p> <p>But the elevation of chief operating officer Julian Horn-Smith to the new post of deputy chief executive raised speculation about the future for Mr Sarin, who took up his post in July last year. </p> <p>Mr Horn-Smith has been with the company since it started in the early 80s and was part of the team led by Sir Christopher Gent who transformed Vodafone into the world's largest mobile phone operator. </p> <p>A spokesman for Vodafone said yesterday Mr Horn-Smith would perform \"an ambassadorial role\" when he takes up his post at the start of next year. He will oversee the company's partly owned ventures in France, China and the US as well as affiliated partner networks. </p> <p>Mr Sarin will have greater day-to-day control of the Vodafone's wholly owned businesses, especially in the UK, Germany and Japan. </p> <p>Vodafone hopes making regional operations report directly to Mr Sarin will speed up decision-making as the company moves from being the acquisitions machine created by Sir Christopher to a more rounded business. </p> <p>There were mixed reactions to Vodafone's choice of Andy Halford, finance chief of Vodafone's US joint venture Verizon Wireless, to replace Mr Hydon when he retires next July. </p> <p>Mr Halford joined Vodafone in 1999 as finance director in the UK and went to Verizon Wireless two years ago. Analysts said, while he seemed impressive at the group's recent analysts' day in the City, they had expected the third largest quoted company in the UK to hire from another FTSE 100 company. </p> <p>It also emerged yesterday that T-Mobile is in discussions with Stelios Haji-Ioannou about providing his Easy empire with the network needed to set up its own mobile phone company. </p> <p>The easyJet founder announced easyMobile in August but has still not managed to find a network partner. Vodafone and O2, which provides the network for Tesco Mobile, have both ruled themselves out while Orange, which is still considering getting involved, is arguing with him over his use of the colour orange in his marketing. </p> <p>T-Mobile provides the network for Virgin Mobile and signing up the Greek entrepreneur would create a direct competitor to Sir Richard Branson's recently floated mobile arm.</p>",
  "<p>Conrad Black has launched a third libel suit against directors of newspaper publisher Hollinger International Inc, this time over allegations he engaged in a \"pattern of racketeering\". </p> <p>The lawsuit, filed in Canada in June, seeks C$110m (\u00a348m) in damages, Black said in a statement yesterday. Two earlier libel claims made public by Black have sought combined damages of \u00a3860m. </p> <p>The libel suit names Hollinger's interim chief executive Gordon Paris, and directors James Thompson, Richard Burt, Graham Savage and Raymond Seitz. </p> <p>It also names former US securities and exchange commission chairman Richard Breeden, who advised a special Hollinger International committee investigating the company's operations during Black's tenure. </p> <p>Black claims the men brought him \"hatred, ridicule and contempt\" after accusing him of racketeering. </p> <p>The claim stems from a lawsuit the Chicago-based newspaper publisher launched against Black and others seeking \u00a3700m in damages. </p> <p>That lawsuit was amended in May to include charges under a federal racketeering law originally designed to fight organised crime. </p> <p>Black scored a legal victory on Friday when US district court Judge Blanche Manning dismissed the racketeering lawsuit. </p> <p>Hollinger International, which until recently owned the Daily Telegraph, said it was considering appealing against the ruling. A spokesman dismissed the latest libel suit. </p> <p>\"All these libel actions are entirely frivolous attempts to create publicity. Judge Manning's decision on a procedural question has no bearing whatsoever on the truthfulness or accuracy of the underlying allegations,\" he said. </p> <p>Hollinger International fired Black as chairman this year after it discovered what it said were unauthorised payments to him and others.</p>",
  "John Kerry said last night that George Bush bears responsibility for a misguided war in Iraq, lost jobs at home and a rising number of Americans without health care. <p>The incumbent cast his rival in campaign debate as a lifelong liberal bent on raising taxes and government spending.</p> <p>\"There's a mainstream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank,\" President George Bush said in the final debate of a close and contentious campaign for the White House. \"Your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.\"</p> <p>But the Democratic challenger said many of the nation's ills can be laid at Bush's feet.</p> <p>He \"regrettably rushed us into war\" in Iraq, Mr Kerry said, and is the first White House occupant in seven decades to preside over a net loss of jobs.</p> <p>As for health care, the Democratic senator said, \"five million Americans have lost\" coverage under Bush's watch. \"The president has turned his back on the wellness of America, and there is no system and it's starting to fall apart,\" Mr Kerry said.</p> <p>Kerry and the president also debated abortion, gay rights, immigration and more in a 90-minute debate that underscored their deep differences.</p> <p>This debate was similar in format to the first - the two rivals standing behind identical lecterns set precisely 10 feet (3 metres) apart. </p> <p>The night's first question was whether America could ever be as safe as it was in a pre-terrorist world, and Kerry swiftly turned his answer into an attack on Bush.</p> <p>The president \"regrettably rushed us into war,\" he said, and added that the president had \"pushed alliances away and as a result America is not bearing this enormous burden where safe is not as safe as we ought to be.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush spoke dismissively of his rival.</p> <p>\"My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance, comparing it to prostitution, illegal gambling,\" he said. \"I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.\"</p> <p>Taxes was a particular flash point between the two men.</p> <p>Questioned by moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS, Mr Kerry said he would follow through on his plan to roll back tax cuts for Americans who earn more than $200,000 (\u00a3111,000) a year while preserving the reductions that have gone to lower and middle income wage earners. Under Bush, he said, the tax burden of the wealthy has gone down and that of the middle class has gone up. But Bush said Kerry would never stick to his promise, and his election would mean higher taxes for all.</p> <p>The two men disagreed over abortion, Mr Kerry saying the choice should be \"between a woman, God and her doctor,\" and the president saying he wants to promote a \"culture of life.\"</p> <p>Asked directly whether he supports overturning the 1973 supreme curt ruling that gave women the right to abortion, Mr Bush sidestepped. \"What you're asking me is will I have a litmus test for my judges, and the answer is no,\" the president said.</p> <p>The president dodged a bit, too, when the issue of a minimum wage increase came up. Kerry said emphatically he favours one, and said that Republicans in control of Congress had repeatedly blocked Democratic attempts to pass legislation.</p> <p>Bush and Kerry agreed on one point, stating that marriage should be preserved for heterosexual couples. But they gave different answers when asked about whether homosexuality was a choice.</p> <p>\"I don't know,\" said the president. Mr Kerry referred to vice-president Dick Cheney's gay daughter, and said it was not a choice. \"We're all God's children,\" he said.</p> <p>Asked about the catholic bishops who have advised parishioners it would be a sin to vote for a candidate who supports abortion rights, Kerry evoked the name of John F Kennedy, another Massachusetts senator and the first catholic elected president.</p> <p>He quoted Kennedy's famous 1960 campaign statement in which he said he wasn't running to become a Catholic president, but the first president who happens to be a catholic.</p>",
  "Detainees held at Belmarsh high security prison without charge or trial have become seriously clinically depressed and are suffering from anxiety, with a number becoming psychotic as a result of their indefinite detention, a report by some of the country's top psychiatrists concludes. <p>Some of the men have suicidal thoughts and many have self-harmed, ranging from cutting their bodies to attempts at hanging, according to doctors.</p> <p>Eleven men are detained under anti-terrorism legislation because the home secretary, David Blunkett, believes that they are a risk to national security. One is held at Broadmoor high security psychiatric hospital because his mental health deteriorated whilst at Belmarsh. Another, identified as G, is under house arrest because he is too sick to remain at the prison.</p> <p>The report concludes that the men's mental state has declined because of the \"sense of helplessness and hopelessness which is an integral aspect of indefinite detention\".</p> <p>It says: \"There is a strong consensus that indefinite detention is linked to deterioration in mental health and that fluctuations in mental state are related to the prison regime and to the vagaries of the appeal system.\"</p> <p>Three of the men's wives are also suffering from depression as a result of their husbands' detention. One is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after witnessing her husband's arrest and another is said to have a \"phobic anxiety state\".</p> <p>The report says: \"Concern with regard to their wives' mental state is exacerbating the mental health problems of many detainees.\" Some of the detainees suffered mental health problems before their detention but this has been seriously exacerbated, the specialists conclude. The report has been compiled by psychiatrists including Professor Ian Robbins at St George's hospital in London and Dr James McKeith of the South London and Maudsley NHS trust.</p> <p>Last May, the Guardian visited one of the detainees, Mahmoud Abu Rideh, at Broadmoor. The hospital said that he was not sufficiently ill to be detained there, but to send him back to Belmarsh would lead to a further deterioration, resulting in him being in a Catch-22 mental health limbo.</p> <p>Last April, the first detainee to be released without charge from Belmarsh, M, told the Guardian that a number of his fellow inmates had become \"mad, exactly mad\". G was released on bail on the orders of the special immigration appeals commission (Siac) - and to the fury of the home secretary - because he had become mentally deranged in prison.</p> <p>Last month the home secretary released another detainee after almost three years without charge. He was among the first alleged terrorists to be detained under the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act 2001. The Algerian national, identified only as D, was said by Siac to have a \"long history of involvement in terrorist support activity\".</p> <p>Last night a prison service spokeswoman said: \"All people held at Belmarsh have access to 24-hour healthcare on the basis of clinical need.\"</p>",
  "His face has the grey, pasty pallor associated with long-term incarceration. His eyes are dull and glazed and his breath comes in rasps. <p>This is Manfred Zachel, a 68-year-old man of German origin, who this week began his eighth year on remand in Brixton prison in south London. </p> <p>Mr Zachel, who is fighting his extradition to South Africa, where he is wanted on fraud and sexual charges, is the longest-serving prisoner being held without trial in the UK. </p> <p>During his time in Brixton he has had dozens of cellmates, some of them heavy drug users, and says he has been robbed three times. He says he was also attacked when allegations of sexual offences were made in front of other prisoners. </p> <p>Mr Zachel's health has declined and he now uses a wheelchair. He has dizzy spells and fits. A consultant from Guy's Hospital in London who has examined him has said his health would deteriorate further if had to take a long-haul flight; but the Home Office continues to insist he should be removed. </p> <p>It is unusual for a prisoner to spend such a long time in a jail like Brixton, which is designed to hold prisoners for a short period before their trial or as they await allocation to another prison after sentence. </p> <p>Human rights campaigners have criticised Mr Zachel's continued imprisonment; if he had been convicted in South Africa he would probably already be free. </p> <p>Sabine Zanker, a lawyer for Fair Trials Abroad, said Mr Zachel's condition was worsening by the day. \"I very much doubt he is in a fit state to be imprisoned, let alone stand trial, instruct a lawyer or survive a long-haul flight.\" </p> <p>Mr Zachel asked to see the Guardian last year. At first the Home Office refused but reversed its decision after the newspaper began judicial review proceedings. </p> <p>During an interview in the Victorian prison's medical centre, Mr Zachel said he would rather stay in Brixton than be returned to South Africa, where he believes his life would be in danger and he would not receive a fair trial. He claims trumped-up charges were brought against him because he refused to take part in a money-laundering scam involving powerful, shady figures. </p> <p>He said: \"Even if my life was not in danger from my enemies, I would die from mistreatment in prison there.\" </p> <p>Speaking with the help of a German interpreter, Mr Zachel tells an extraordinary story. He says he was born in Germany in 1936. After his mother, Marie, was killed by the SS in 1939 he went to live with an aunt in Holland. </p> <p>As a boy, Mr Zachel says he carried messages for the Dutch resistance movement, claims which are supported by two former resistance fighters, 80-year-old Wim Loysen and Thijs Spronk, 90, whom the Guardian tracked down. </p> <p>As a young adult, Mr Zachel turned to crime. Between 1954 and 1990 he served a total of nine years in prison in Germany and Belgium for offences including fraud, deception and receiving stolen goods. </p> <p>But he claims he learned his lesson and built up legitimate financial businesses. In 1994 he set up home in Torquay. </p> <p>Mr Zachel alleges that in 1995 while he was on an extended business trip to South Africa he was approached by a senior financial figure who, Mr Zachel claims, tried to persuade him to take part in a money-laundering scam. </p> <p>He refused and was arrested on September 19 1996 at gunpoint and accused of mortgage fraud and sexually abusing a 13-year-old boy who was staying at his rented home. </p> <p>Mr Zachel strongly denies both allegations. He says he was helping educate the boy with the consent of his parents. The Guardian spoke to Mr Zachel's alleged victim, who has moved to Germany. He said he \"willingly and resolutely denied\" that anything improper had occurred and added: \"Manfred always treated me as I guess he would treat his own son.\" </p> <p>Lawyers who have examined the allegation of mortgage fraud do not believe it would stand up in court. </p> <p>In January 1997 Mr Zachel suffered a heart attack and was taken from Newlock prison to Wilgers hospital in Pretoria. There he was seen by two friends, both former military officers, who raised concerns. Pieter Willem de Jager, a former colonel in the South African Defence Force, made a statement to Mr Zachel's lawyers in which he said it looked as if he had been drugged. </p> <p>Ronald Laubscher, who had been a senior medical officer in the defence force, examined Mr Zachel and in an affidavit claimed his friend had not suffered an ordinary heart attack. Both de Jager and Laubscher have claimed Mr Zachel's life would be in danger if he was forced to return to South Africa. </p> <p>Mr Zachel spent several weeks in intensive care before being taken to a secure clinic in Pretoria. On June 28 1997 Mr Zachel was reported missing from the clinic. At first, his disappearance was treated as an abduction - the clinic is surrounded by high walls and Mr Zachel could not walk unaided at the time - but later it was investigated as a jailbreak. </p> <p>He claims he woke up tied to a plank and was tortured by having electrodes placed on his head. He claims his captors interrogated him about financial matters, apparently believing he had valuable information about the banking world. Several days later he says he was found in a park. Friends hid him and he travelled back to his home in Torquay, where he was arrested on October 12 1997. </p> <p>Mr Zachel claims \"forces\" in South Africa would not allow him to receive a fair trial. \"If they return me to South Africa, I will kill myself before they kill me,\" he said. </p> <p>In July 2000 the then home secretary, Jack Straw, decided Mr Zachel should be returned to South Africa on the grounds that a prima facie case had been established against him and he would get a fair trial. </p> <p>His case has already been subject to one judicial review but Mr Zachel is awaiting a second. His grounds include the fact that though he has served seven years in prison, this would not count towards any sentence he receives in South Africa. </p> <p>His solicitor, Mike Schwarz, said: \"It is a travesty he has been in custody this length of time and the Home Office is still adamant he should be removed. Mr Zachel should be released on both legal and humanitarian grounds.\" </p> <p>Julian Knight, a South African lawyer specialising in public interest law, called the case against Mr Zachel \"capricious\" but said even if he was convicted he would serve a maximum of five years. </p> <p>Ludwig Linden, a spokesman for the German embassy, said: \"I have to set aside my emotions. We are monitoring Mr Zachel's position closely.\" </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said yesterday: \"Extradition cases heard under the Extradition Act 1989 did not contain any time limits on appeals which could be brought by the subject. </p> <p>Therefore if a subject chooses to appeal against extradition on a number of occasions, this process can take time to be properly considered. </p> <p>It is precisely for this reason that we have introduced the Extradition Act 2003, which will deliver swifter justice by removing the unnecessary delays and duplication that afflicted procedures under the earlier act.\"</p>",
  "Let's be honest. If we are not on TV, rapping, running for Britain, or reading the news, most country people don't see a black face like mine from one week to the next (Villages bristle at accusation of rural prejudice, October 9). On the other hand, London gives me the creeps - a lot of black faces, but when the people cleaning the train, emptying bins and mopping up spills in Paddington are always black, I'm saddened, not refreshed. <p>When I reach my hotel, who makes the beds, cleans the loos and wipes the tables? When I get to my meeting, who guards the entrance, staffs reception and restocks the vending machines? And in the meeting (I work in the media), what colour are the delegates I sit next to? White almost every time. In London, there are jobs for whites - and when they've gone, a rainbow of races and faces can then chase after the leftovers. </p> <p>Without contacts, better-than-average qualifications and a lot of bottle, working-class and professional black people know instinctively they're no better off in town or countryside. The countryside is white because racism runs rife right through our society. To call it passive apartheid is a cop-out. <br><b>Joanna Traynor</b> <br>Plymouth</p> <p>The deputy minister for women, Jacqui Smith, misses the point when she dismisses the Commission for Racial Equality's rejection of a single equality body (Legislation soon for new rights body, October 12). The CRE is speaking not for itself, but for Britain's black and minority ethnic communities. And there is no representative black and minority ethnic organisation that supports these proposals. It will mean in practice a downgrading of the CRE's current powers in key areas, including law enforcement, support for casework, applications for injunctions and the power to launch inquiries into named organisations. </p> <p>Jacqui Smith gives the game away when she describes the new body as a \"modern, light-touch regulator\". What about working for the elimination of racial discrimination, promoting equal opportunity and uncovering and proving unlawful racial discrimination? These issues are as vital as ever. <br><b>Diane Abbott MP</b> <br>Lab, Hackney North <br><b>Keith Vaz MP</b> <br>Lab, Leicester East </p>",
  "Parliament is becoming a democratic Fort Knox from which the public feel excluded, a minister warns today. <p>As part of an effort to reconnect politicians with the electorate, Harriet Harman, the solicitor general, argues that MPs are becoming cut off from their constituents by new security measures at Westminster and by the growing professionalisation of politics. </p> <p>Proposing a series of small and easily implemented solutions, she suggests that MPs and their constituents should be allowed to correspond with one another free of charge at the expense of the taxpayer - a proposal that yesterday won the backing of the serjeant at arms. </p> <p>But in a sign that parliament's isolation may be about to grow not contract, the home secretary, David Blunkett, announced yesterday that he was formally consulting with Transport for London over plans to close Parliament Square, in the centre of the capital, to traffic. The most likely outcome is closure of the road alongside Big Ben and the road immediately alongside parliament. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett is acting on security advice suggesting that Big Ben is vulnerable to terrorist attack. </p> <p>Ms Harman, a long-time advocate of modernisation in of the Commons, including family-friendly sitting hours, points out in a briefing paper that \"25 years ago you could walk in with no pass, the sergeant at arms' staff were present to direct you to where you wanted to go rather than to check you for security purposes. Now it is not only more difficult to get in as a member of the public, but parliament looks more remote with the visible presence of armed police and with large concrete barriers\". </p> <p>She adds: \"Even when the public get into parliament when they go into the chamber they sit behind a glass screen. We need to take account of the effect that it will create in the public's mind and try and redress it.\" She has also said that the government's large majority and the relatively ineffective opposition meant that some people saw parliament as a rubber stamp for Tony Blair. This reinforced the sense of distance between the public and parliament. Parliament was seen as being \"there for the government\", not \"there for me\". </p> <p>She argues that all constituents should be given a free phone number for contacting their elected representatives and proposes that all MPs should be expected to teach hour-long citizenship classes in local secondary schools. </p> <p>\"We need to hear from our constituents and the public at large, and they should not have to pay,\" Mrs Harman said. </p> <p>On the basis of similar schemes overseas, she calculates that the cost of a free-post address for parliament might amount to \u00a3456,500 a year in total. </p> <p>MPs should also be expected to send an annual report to their constituents, she said. </p> <p>Ms Harman has discussed her ideas with the office of leader of the house, Peter Hain. The office broadly supports her proposals; Mr Hain has already won agreement for a new, visitor-friendly entrance which would not leave the public queuing outside to see MPs in action. </p> <p>Mr Hain is also looking at the idea of an explanatory visitor centre near parliament. Ms Harman is also proposing that all select committees, as a matter of course, hold evidence sessions in the communities affected by their inquiries. </p> <p>Mr Hain's modernisation committee is one of many select committees that has held sessions outside the Commons. </p> <p>Following the committee's recommendations, a number of smaller changes are being made, including the deletion of any reference to \"strangers in parliament\", a term traditionally used to refer to anyone who is not an MP. </p> <p>During the financial year of 2003-2004, 136,156 people visited the galleries of the house and 105,529 took part in tours organised by MPs.</p>",
  "<p>Iain Duncan Smith yesterday made a rare Commons intervention when he warned Tony Blair that some frail patients still risk being \"starved or dehydrated to death\" despite legislation to protect mentally incapable patients from \"creeping euthanasia\". </p> <p>The former Conservative leader demanded that Labour MPs get a free vote on the remaining stages of the mental capacity bill, which got a little-reported second reading on Monday night. </p> <p>He told Mr Blair: \"I don't know what your view on this is but it surely cannot be right in this day and age that the most vulnerable people can be starved or dehydrated to death simply because they cannot speak for themselves.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair promised to look into it. </p> <p>During Monday's debate a number of MPs from all parties took issue with the constitutional affairs minister David Lammy over his assurances that acutely ill people in hospital who may have ANH (artificial nutrition and hydration) withdrawn from them will be better protected. </p> <p>Mr Lammy stressed that the \"best interests\" of the individual were at the heart of the long-promised but complex reform. There would also be scope to appoint someone to look after one's future interests and a new court of protection. </p> <p>But MPs have been badgered by activists who fear that the medical professions are being allowed to move towards a euthanasia policy - \"by the back door\", said Mr Duncan Smith - of the kind that is lawful in the Netherlands and elsewhere. </p> <p>Mr Duncan Smith joined the 326-62 vote minority on Monday after studying the bill and hearing Claire Curtis-Thomas, the Labour MP for Crosby, describe how her mother had changed her mind about being allowed to die after suffering a stroke. She lived happily for five more years. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Alan Johnson, the work and pensions secretary, yesterday sprung a surprise when he said he was moving positively towards a Liberal Democrat proposal for a new non-means tested state pension called the citizens pension. </p> <p>The move startled the shadow welfare secretary, David Willetts, who said Mr Johnson's remarks were very significant. He warned that the Lib Dem proposal would mean the end of the contributory principle. </p> <p>Mr Johnson had been challenged in a Commons debate over whether he backed the citizens pension idea based on residence, not contributions. </p> <p>He replied he was moving towards a \"very positive\" stance on the idea and confirmed that the current means tested pension credit was not intended as an \"indefinite\" solution.<br><strong>Patrick Wintour</strong></p>",
  "Tony Blair yesterday offered a crowded House of Commons his most direct apology yet for deficiencies in the intelligence dossiers he presented to MPs to help justify the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. <p>But he again denied misrepresenting the much-discredited intelligence he had received from M16, and refused to apologise for the war itself in the face of renewed allegations that the remaining justification - regime change - is illegal in international law. </p> <p>A war to enforce UN resolutions was not illegal, the prime minister insisted after Michael Howard suggested that he had \"not accurately\" reported the intelligence assessment to MPs. </p> <p>\"Will you now say sorry for that?\" asked the Conservative leader, who had been careful to say in advance: \"I supported the war, it was the right thing to do.\" For the umpteenth time since the post-war occupation began to go sour, Mr Blair avoided the word \"sorry\". Instead, he said: \"I take full responsibility and apologise for any information given in good faith that has subsequently turned out to be wrong. That is entirely proper. I have already done so.\" </p> <p>His aides insisted later that he had added nothing to what he has frequently said. But his unqualified use of the present tense in front of the Commons itself - rather than at his party conference - may appease even some Labour critics, who believe the controversy is finally running out of steam. </p> <p>Even so, he got no favours from ally Peter Mandelson, who used a speech last night in Hungary to argue that a second UN resolution and greater UN involvement would have been a better solution to Iraq. </p> <p>In any case, Mr Blair went straight back on to the offensive on what he still regards as the substantive issues. \"What I do not in any way accept is that there was any deception of anyone. I will not apologise for removing Saddam Hussein. I will not apologise for the conflict. I believe it was right then, is right now and essential for the wider security of that region and world.\" </p> <p>Labour loyalists cheered him throughout the bitter exchanges with Mr Howard and Charles Kennedy a week after the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) confirmed the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, but not the ambition to seek them. </p> <p>Other Labour MPs joined critics in trying to corner Mr Blair for aspects of his pre-war statements, including the final collapse of the claim that WMD could be launched within 45 minutes - an issue not raised in the pre-war debate on March 18 2003, Mr Blair reminded the house. </p> <p>The exchanges prompted Mr Kennedy to say Mr Blair had made a crucial admission that \"we always made it clear that the only way of enforcing the UN resolutions was regime change\", though the context of the remark suggests he meant it only if Saddam Hussein refused to comply with UN disarmament resolutions. </p> <p>\"Tony Blair must clarify the position. Did he sign up to regime change in April 2002 at his meeting with President Bush in Texas? If he did, why was this policy - which is not acceptable in international law - kept secret from the British people?\" </p> <p>Mr Blair's answer was: \"We went to war because we took the view that we had to enforce the UN resolutions, that we could not continue, not post-September 11, with a situation where a country was in breach of UN obligations ... that was the reason given at the time.\" Mr Blair's irritation with the same line of questioning was evident in his jibe that Mr Howard was seeking to exploit anti-war feeling for political gain. </p> <p>The Tory leader had had four different positions on the war this year, \"three too many\" for an aspiring prime minister, he said.</p>",
  "The case of a woman who lost her baby after a commuter on a packed train pushed into her has led to an MP seeking to launch a \"considerate commuters\" campaign. <p>Janice Norman was six months pregnant with her first child when she was jostled and pushed in the stomach by a commuter trying to move through the carriage. She went to hospital for a check-up and was told she was fine. </p> <p>But a month later she had to have an emergency caesarean and her baby died five days later. A post mortem suggested the baby's growth might have been affected by the accident. </p> <p>Ms Norman, 34, of Carshalton, Surrey, told London's Evening Standard she had argued with the man after he barged into her. </p> <p>She had often had to stand and would be ignored by other passengers. </p> <p>Tom Brake, Liberal Democrat MP for Carshalton and Wallington, yesterday tabled an early day motion in the Commons to highlight the problem of vulnerable commuters. </p> <p>He accepted it would be difficult to legislate for commuters to show consideration for fellow passengers, but said train companies could be required to provide more seating specifically for vulnerable people. </p> <p>\"The focus should be on commuters being considerate. But the long-term solution is to have a transport system that's not vastly overcrowded.\" </p> <p>Tommy's, a baby charity, said its research suggested pregnant women were rarely offered seats on public transport. \"The issue is not a lack of chivalry but a lack of realisation,\" said a spokesperson. </p> <p>Lucilla Poston, professor of maternal and foetal health at King's College Hospital in London, said that while babies were resilient, a blow to the lower abdomen of a pregnant woman could be dangerous and women ought to take care. </p> <p>\"We suggest pregnant women should see if they can come in outside rush hour because the heat and crowding on a packed train can multiply problems,\" she said.</p>",
  "The number of deaths from infections picked up in hospital, including the so-called superbug MRSA, is four times higher than the government's official figure, campaigners claimed yesterday. <p>The MRSA support group said that the government's tally of 5,000 deaths a year comes from statistics compiled in 1994. Their analysis of statistics from official bodies suggests that the real number of annual deaths is closer to 20,000. </p> <p>Half of those 20,000 deaths would be from the methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteria, or MRSA, Tony Field of the group said. The government's 1994 break-down gave 800 out of 5,000 deaths as from MRSA. </p> <p>Mr Field said the true tally of deaths from hospital-acquired infections could be higher than 20,000 a year. </p> <p>\"The situation is far worse even than this figure because doctors are not obliged to mention MRSA on a death certificate as a secondary cause of death. There's a lot of unreporting,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Field, 64, gave up his job as a financial adviser after being left on crutches by a hospital infection. </p> <p>\"It's quite outrageous,\" he said. \"We call it the unnecessary infection because if the hospitals were clean and proper hygiene was undertaken the problem would be reduced enormously. </p> <p>\"The government is in a state of denial over the whole matter and they ought to wake up and face the truth before they can get matters right.\" </p> <p>The Department of Health said it did not have a clear idea of the death rate, but added that the people who die from hospital acquired infections are already very sick, which is why their immune systems cannot fight the bacteria. </p> <p>\"It is difficult to establish whether MRSA is the cause of death as patients are often seriously ill with other conditions,\" said a spokeswoman, denying that the government was complacent. </p> <p>\"We are taking steps to make sure we have better information about the extent of health care associated infections. </p> <p>\"The Chief Medical Officer's report Winning Ways called for an audit of deaths from healthcare associated infections, which will be introduced from 2006, and therefore better data should be available in the future.\" </p> <p>The government published plans earlier this year to improve the cleanliness and safety of hospitals, she said. </p> <p>\"These plans set out common sense measures that will help minimise the spread of MRSA, like staff washing their hands properly and matrons being given more power to improve cleanliness and infection control in their wards.\" </p> <p>Paul Burstow, the Liberal Democrats' health spokesman, said nobody knew the scale of the problem, but attacked the government's handling of it. </p> <p>\"When it comes to fighting MRSA, this government is working in the dark. </p> <p>\"It neither has any idea of the true level of MRSA, nor has it actively sought to find out. </p> <p>\"Labour has a poor record on tackling hospital infections. A succession of announcements, stunts and gimmicks has failed to reverse the rising tide of infections. Ministers are guilty of talking tough about this problem, but wilfully failing to take the necessary steps to wipe it out.\"</p>",
  "The NHS yesterday appointed a manager from the motor industry to be its first ever \"equality tsar\", spearheading efforts to rid the health service of racial discrimination and gender bias. <p>Sir Nigel Crisp, the chief executive, said he had recruited Surinder Sharma, diversity director of Ford Europe, to the \u00a395,000-a-year full-time position as NHS director for equality and human rights. </p> <p>Mr Sharma will be expected to act as a human rights champion throughout the NHS and social care system, tackling problems of prejudice that have beset the service for many years. </p> <p>In February, an inquiry into the death of David \"Rocky\" Bennett described institutional racism in the NHS as a \"festering abscess\" damaging the reputation of the service. It called for an ethnicity tsar to lead a programme of reform. </p> <p>Further concern was raised by the health inspectorate after a survey of 370,000 patients showed above-average dissatisfaction with the NHS among people from the Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. </p> <p>Mr Sharma, a qualified lawyer, has worked in the diversity field for 25 years, including periods at the BBC and Littlewoods Retail. He chairs the legal committee of the Equal Opportunities Commission. </p> <p>Sir Nigel, who launched a 10-point equality action plan for the NHS in March, has asked Mr Sharma to investigate why black people are six times more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act and first-generation immigrants from south Asia are 50% more likely to die from a heart attack. </p> <p>Sir Nigel Crisp said: \"The NHS workforce must reflect the community it serves. </p> <p>\"Equality and diversity need to be explicitly acknowledged ... Our success in this will be judged not on what we say but on what we do, and I have full confidence that Surinder will put in place processes that will make a real difference.\" </p> <p>The health secretary, John Reid, said: \"We have two aims with this appointment: first, to make sure that appropriate services are available to anyone in the population, regardless of their background; second, to ensure we can draw on the talents, skills and passion of all parts of the community.\"</p>",
  "John Prescott's plans to cram an extra half a million homes into the east of England will cause a water crisis, threaten landscapes, damage historic towns and destroy wildlife, according to an independent consultant's report commissioned to look at the proposals. <p>The Guardian has seen detailed lists of the suggested housing developments in each district of six counties in the region. The proposals are due to be agreed on Friday at a committee of the east of England's regional assembly. </p> <p>Areas which will take the brunt of the housing include a \"growth corridor\" from Peterborough through Cambridge, Stevenage and Harlow, part of the expansion of Milton Keynes and the Thames Gateway development where it spills over into Essex. </p> <p>The detailed lists were drawn up at the insistence of Mr Prescott's office before an independent consultant's report required by EU law to look at the possible impact of the changes. </p> <p>The report was finished a few days ago and concludes that the government plan \"is likely to have serious negative impacts on water resources, biodiversity, tranquillity, air quality, recreational access and congestion. The larger the volume of development the harder it will be to avoid increased flood risk, erosion of the quality and distinctiveness of settlements and the built environment, and landscape.\" </p> <p>The deputy prime minister's housing drive is intended to slow the price rises across the country. It is also designed to provide cheap homes for key workers such as health workers and teachers, particularly in the south-east, where many are dissuaded from applying for jobs because of the overheated housing market. </p> <p>The proposals seen by the Guardian cover the most intensive cramming of the green belt proposed by Mr Prescott - around half the extra houses needed to meet demand in the overheated south-east. </p> <p>Altogether the plans are for 478,000 homes to be built at the rate of 23,900 a year until 2021. The largest share falls on the fringes of London in Hertfordshire and Essex, the two counties most unhappy with the proposals. </p> <p>The leader of Hertfordshire county council, Robert Ellis, said the demands being made on the county were impossible because of lack of roads and railways to cope with the extra people who will live in another 79,500 houses. He feared that some of the busiest motorways in the country could become gridlocked. </p> <p>\"This is already the most densely populated county in England, with 1 million people, crammed in 29 settlements surrounded by green belt. The M25, M1, A1 and M11, all key trunk roads which cross the county, are already full to capacity.\" </p> <p>He said that the region's railways were full, with no investment planned. </p> <p>\"All this is supposed to be sustainable. There is nothing sustainable about it.\" </p> <p>The consultants, Levett-Therivel, note that the whole of eastern England is already under stress and say a sensible approach would have been to compare benefits of developing in the area with other parts of the country, particularly in the north. </p> <p>\"We suspect that growth would be far less environmentally damaging in many other parts of the UK, especially the north of England, because there is generally much greater environmental and infrastructure headroom.\" </p> <p>A committee of the assembly is expected to pass the plan on Friday to be ratified by the full assembly on November 5. Eventually it will go to a public inquiry. </p> <p>Mr Ellis said: \"We believe that once it gets through the committee on Friday it will be too late to go back on it. Mr Prescott has railroaded this through the new regional assembly process. There seems to be no opportunity to look at any constructive alternative and after Friday we will have no say in the matter.\" </p> <p>The government blueprint predicts that the provision of affordable homes will lead to economic growth in the area and generate 379,100 jobs. However, many of the jobs are associated with the expansion of Luton and Stansted airports, and more than 10,000 houses proposed for Stevenage would be built on the Luton flight path. </p> <p>Sean Traverse-Healy, deputy director of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: \"It seems idiotic to develop the south-east when other regions need renewal. The papers make it perfectly clear that further development in what they call the London arc is unsustainable. This is the driest part of the country. We just cannot keep pumping more and more water.\" </p> <p>Transport campaigners were equally concerned. Steve Hounsham, of Transport 2000, said: \"This plan was supposed to be about sustainable settlements which encouraged more walking, cycling, and public transport and stopped car dependency. Instead what we have is adding estates in green fields on the edge of existing settlements so forcing people to use a car to commute to work and the shops.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Prescott's office said it would be wrong to comment before the decision on Friday but the government was not forcing growth on anyone. There was a demand for growth in the south-east, not in the north, and the government was aiming to satisfy that. </p> <p>\"Our general view is that new homes will not be built without supporting roads, hospitals and schools, and the new communities will be sustainable.\"</p>",
  "<p>A former detective and an ex-local government employee were jailed yesterday for a \"despicable\" plot to try to con a local authority out of almost \u00a3100,000 earmarked for deprived children. </p> <p>Kurtis Nwadikwa-Jonathan, 38, a former detective constable with Newham CID in east London, admitted helping Uche Wogu, also 38, a former finance director at Hackney council, in the scam. </p> <p>The officer submitted bogus applications to set up two after-school clubs for underprivileged children in Hackney, one of London's poorest boroughs. Wogu, who suggested the plan, had a big say in getting such grants approved. </p> <p>The pair, both from Nigeria, intended to spend just enough of the \u00a394,960 they hoped to net to provide \"orange squash and a biscuit\" for the children, and to cream off the rest of the money for themselves. </p> <p>Wogu, of Enfield, north London, who admitted two counts of misconduct in public office, was sentenced to two years, while Nwadikwa-Jonathan, of Slade Green, Kent, who pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting, got 18 months. </p> <p>Judge Derek Inman, at Middlesex Guildhall crown court in London, told the pair: \"From any point of view, these were despicable, mean and shabby activities, and you both, with your education, and background in finance and the police, must have fully realised that. You were both motivated by what can only be described as financial greed.\" </p> <p>Wogu helped Nwadikwa-Jonathan submit applications to the Learning Trust for a Sure Start out of school grant for two clubs, which would each cater for 60 children aged five to 11. If approved, the council would give more than \u00a3900 for each child. </p> <p>Nwadikwa-Jonathan used false names and addresses to try to keep secret his close friendship with Wogu. He even forged a tenancy agreement from a local hall, which had in fact refused to house the clubs. </p> <p>In taped conversations, Wogu was heard to say: \"I hope to behave as a rich man this year.\"</p>",
  "A small group of smokers are shielding themselves from the rain in Smoker's Alley, a covered walkway which reeks of stale tobacco between the city's register office and an upmarket Chinese restaurant. A pile of cigarette butts has been swept into a corner along with the autumn leaves. <p>In Manchester, the fag break, that institution of British office life, is about to become a thing of the past for more than 26,000 employees. </p> <p>The city council is banning smoking in all its buildings, including the splendid neo-Gothic town hall. Council workers will be similarly banned from smoking in all the entrances to its buildings. There will be no smoking facilities provided anywhere, inside or outside, and staff will not be not allowed time off work to go and have a cigarette. Anyone contravening these rules will face disciplinary action and, ultimately, the sack. </p> <p>Smokers are finding themselves increasingly marginalised in a move which will delight the anti-smoking lobby, but will horrify smokers. </p> <p>\"This is probably the most important public health decision Manchester has made for generations,\" said Pat Karney, the head of the pressure group Smoke-Free Greater Manchester. \"It's on par with the clean air acts of the last century. </p> <p>\"It means that the next generation of Mancunians will grow up in a city protected from toxic second-hand smoke.\" </p> <p>It is the first step in making the conurbation's workplaces smoke-free. A report on tobacco control was agreed by the council's executive yesterday, proposing that visitors and councillors are also banned from smoking. </p> <p>\"Staff will not be able to excuse themselves for smoking breaks during work time,\" says the report. \"Failure to abide by the tobacco control policy could result in the initiation of disciplinary action on the individual, in accordance with Manchester city council procedures. Non-employees who breach the policy will be asked to leave the premises. Smokers, employees and non-employees may be fined for littering the streets when inappropriately disposing of cigarette ends.\" </p> <p>Around the corner from the town hall, in Smoker's Alley, this proposal is greeted with contempt. </p> <p>\"I have long since given up taking notice of what the council say,\" said Danny Warke, 43, who has smoked for 30 years. \"I think it is ridiculous. At the end of the day, we are out in the fresh air smoking. What about all the cars chucking out fumes? I am sure they will get the trade unions on to it; it is about freedom of choice and we are not doing anyone any harm. I know the cigarette butts can look unsightly but they should provide more ashtrays.\" </p> <p>Karen Timon, who was enjoying a cigarette with two other smokers, said her boyfriend works at the council and they were \"not at all happy about this\". </p> <p>She said: \"I think it is right for companies to have designated areas for smokers but it is wrong that we won't be able to have breaks. </p> <p>\"Whether you smoke or not, has nothing to do with your employer. It is a personal choice and its like them asking have you had sex, or have you had a drink. It has gone too far towards the nannying state.\" </p> <p>In the report, Manchester is portrayed as a city with a history of being forward-thinking and unafraid of taking risks. \"The smoke-free city is an idea whose time has come: Manchester should be in the vanguard of this change,\" it says. </p> <p>It follows the model of Dublin, which has had smoke-free workplaces (including pubs, clubs and restaurants) for six months. </p> <p>Rates of smoking in Greater Manchester are among the highest in England. The most reliable data from the Health Survey for England indicates the smoking rate was 38.5%, compared with 28.8% across England as a whole. </p> <p>In a recent Mori poll in the region, 77% of respondents said they were bothered by smoke in public places; 74% favoured smoke-free enclosed public spaces and 90% agreed that people who work indoors have the right to work in a smoke-free environment. Only a quarter favoured completely smoke-free pubs and bars, with a further 39% wanting them mainly smoke-free with separate smoking areas. </p> <p>Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, said: \"We take the health of our residents and visitors very seriously. We are not proposing to ban smoking, but to take a lead in doing something about the number of deaths and amount of illness caused every year by smoking and breathing second-hand smoke. </p> <p>\"We need to get a message over: reduce smoking and live longer.\" </p> <p>The anti-smoking organisation, ASH, said it strongly supported employers who want to go fully smoke-free. \"We applaud Manchester council's efforts to encourage and support staff that want to quit,\" said Ian Willmore, its spokesman. </p> <p>\"That will greatly improve the health of the council's workforce, reduce sickness absence and improve the standard and efficiency of its services to the public.\" ASH says it has been estimated that exposure to other people's smoke in the workplace causes 700 premature deaths across the UK every year - three times the number killed in industrial accidents. </p> <p>Second-hand smoke at work also causes many thousands of episodes of illness and is the second most common trigger of asthma attacks. Research in Canada suggests employees who smoke cost their employers an average about \u00a31,500 a year through absence and lost productivity. </p> <p>\"Although many offices and other workplaces are now smoke-free, more than 2 million people still work in places where smoking is allowed throughout, and another 10 million work in places where smoking is allowed somewhere on the premises,\" Mr Willmore said. </p> <p>\"As far as smoking breaks are concerned, that has to be a matter for each employer to discuss with their own workforce and trade unions. There isn't any obvious reason why smokers should get longer work breaks than non-smokers.\" </p> <p>But Simon Clark, spokesman for Forest, the smoker's lobby group, described cigarette breaks as \"punctuation marks for smokers through the day\". </p> <p>\"This is another demonstration of the anti-smoking hysteria that is happening in parts of the country. When you remember that about a quarter of the population are smokers, to refuse to allow them to smoke at any point during the day is very heavy-handed.\"</p> <p><b>For and against the fag break</b></p> <p><b> Stephen Merchant, co-writer of The Office</b> </p> <p>\"I'm anti-smoking in that I don't smoke and it bothers me. I'd quite happily see smoking banned in restaurants but people huddled in the doorways of offices in the rain is a quintessential part of British life. You can't take that away. It is all people have got to keep them going. </p> <p>If you work in a call centre - and I used to work in one - the fag break is the highlight of your day.\" </p> <p><b>Felix Dennis, media mogul and poet currently touring Britain</b></p> <p>\"At Dennis Publishing, our policy is pretty simple. If only one person in the office doesn't want smoking then we don't do it, but we provide roof terraces where people can walk out, catch some sun, sit on comfortable chairs and take a cigarette break. </p> <p>\"What we need here is a massive smoke-in. We need 2,000 people smoking outside Manchester city council buildings.\" </p> <p><b>Ronald Harwood, playwright, screenwriter</b></p> <p>\"That's disgusting. Banning smoking is a fascist impulse. The first government ever to try to ban smoking was the government of Adolf Hitler. Manchester city council are fascists. It is dreadful and intolerable. </p> <p>\"People should always have smoking areas or smoking rooms in offices. </p> <p>\"I feel the evidence about passive smoking is about as good as the evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. It has all been twisted.\" </p> <p><b> John Britton, professor of epidemiology, Nottingham city hospital</b> </p> <p>\"There are lots of reasons to ban smoking from offices. If you make a workplace smoke-free it is very good for your employees' health. It encourages a lot of your employees to stop smoking. That is more true if your smoking policy is complete. </p> <p>\"If you replace a partial smoking ban with a complete ban, like Manchester city council's, about one in 14 smokers will quit.\"</p>",
  "A drive to recruit more women, ethnic minority and solicitor judges to make the judiciary more closely represent the general population was launched yesterday by the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, and the lord chief justice, Lord Woolf. <p>The move is an attempt to change the overwhelmingly white, middle-aged, male profile of the judiciary, which has changed little since Labour took office in 1997. </p> <p>Recent months have seen the appointment of the first woman law lord, Brenda Hale, and the first black high court judge, Linda Dobbs. Ms Justice Dobbs is the first ethnic minority judge ever to reach the high court bench and women still account for only 8% of judges in the high court and above. </p> <p>Proposals by Lord Falconer could mean a clear career ladder for judges, who could be appointed earlier than at present to a low rung on the ladder, so gaining time to work their way up. </p> <p>The period of time a lawyer must have been qualified to be eligible for a judicial post, which is now set at seven to 10 years, could be reduced under the plans. </p> <p>Posts could also be opened to those who have not been practising lawyers, such as university law teachers. </p> <p>Rules requiring candidates to spend years sitting first as part-time judges while practising law - which solicitors find hard to comply with - could be altered to allow for intensive periods of part-time sitting. </p> <p>To remove candidates' fears of taking an irrevocable step by accepting a judicial post, judges in more junior posts could be allowed to return to work as lawyers and even advertise themselves as \"former judges\". </p> <p>The proposals would radically alter the existing set-up, whereby judicial appointments are made for life. </p> <p>Lord Falconer said: \"The quality of our judicial system is second to none but it is not representative of the society it serves. We are determined that over time there should be significant change. It really matters in terms of the judicial system and in terms of our society.\" </p> <p>Lord Woolf, the senior judge in England and Wales, said: \"It's essential that we dispel stereotypes and get the message out that we want people from all backgrounds to put themselves forward for judicial office. </p> <p>\"Only by doing that can we achieve a judiciary that is more reflective of society.\" </p> <p>They said that the proposal to allow judges to return to working as lawyers was likely to apply only to posts that were below the level of a circuit judge. </p> <p>Lord Woolf said it was unlikely to be readily accepted that a high court judge could go back into practice, but at the lower levels of the judiciary there \"could be room for a different approach\". </p> <p>Lord Falconer said it would be \"inconceivable\" for a circuit or high court judge to be allowed to return to practice as a barrister or solicitor. </p> <p>The 135-page consultation paper, Increasing Diversity in the Judiciary, said: \"There is anecdotal evidence that individuals with a wide range of skills and expertise can be deterred from applying for full-time appointments because it represents a final career choice, and they may not wish to close the door on other career choices. </p> <p>\"If the preclusion policy were to be removed, it would give individuals the freedom to consider judicial appointment earlier in their legal career, knowing that they still had choices available to them about whether to return to practice or continue on the bench. </p> <p>\"It is important to note that allowing judges to return to practice might have an adverse impact on the stability of the judiciary as a whole if large numbers of judges decided to make such a change.\"</p>",
  "<p>The recent award of the 2004 Nobel prize for medicine to Americans Richard Axel and Linda Buck for their work on the genes involved in smell has broken a near decade-long drought in Nobel science awards to women. The last female science laureate was German developmental biologist, Christiane Nusslein-Volhard in 1995. And since the prize's inception in 1901, just 11 women have won science Nobels, a mere 3% of the total awarded. Frankly I am astonished that it is as many as that. </p> <p>Those women overcame extraordinary obstacles. Rita Levi-Montalcini's career was a decade behind that of her peers. Her father's belief that a professional career would interfere with her duties as wife and mother had prevented her enrolling at university. Gerty Cori did not become a professor until the year she won her prize for her work on sugar metabolism. Gertrude Elion, who discovered some of the world's most effective medicines, could not get a lab job because they were not open to women. So she had to work as a volunteer secretary. </p> <p>Physicist Maria Goeppert Mayer also had to work unpaid. She too could not get a job - because wives were not allowed to be employed by universities if their husbands were on staff (as hers was). This edict remained in force until 1972. Given that 70% of American women physicists were married to scientists, it effectively excluded the majority from scientific discovery. </p> <p>It is still the case that women follow their husband's careers. If they are in partnership with a male scientist, it is automatically assumed that he is the brains and the woman is merely the muse who washes the test tubes. Rosalind Yalow, who won her prize for her invention of radioimmunoassays for hormones, had to re-establish her credentials afresh when her research partner (a man) died. </p> <p>It is 40 years since Britain was last able to celebrate a woman Nobel science laureate. But she got scant praise for it. The Daily Mail greeted the news of Dorothy Hodgkin's chemistry win in 1964 with the headline \"Oxford housewife wins Nobel prize\". </p> <p> A nd then there are those women who were egregiously denied the prize. Physicist Lise Meitner worked with Otto Hahn for 30 years and developed the first theoretical explanation of the fission process. But, exiled from her native Germany and separated from her former collaborator, the Nobel committee failed to understand her part in this. </p> <p>Rosalind Franklin, who played a key role in the discovery of the structure of DNA, died of cancer in 1958 but the Nobel prize was awarded to Crick, Watson and Wilkins in 1962. Her name was praised from the Nobel platform, but not by the three winners. Had she lived, it remains unlikely that she, rather than Wilkins, would have been on that plane to Stockholm. </p> <p>Chien Shiung Wu was a physicist who disproved the law of conservation of parity. She devised the experiment confirming the theory of Drs Lee and Yang, but they were the ones to get the physics Nobel. And Jocelyn Bell Burnell, the Cambridge astronomer who discovered pulsars, did not get a prize, although her supervisor, Anthony Hewish, received one in 1974 for recognising the meaning of his assistant's work. Her age at the time (25) should not have been a barrier. The youngest male winner, physicist William Bragg, was also 25 when awarded his prize in 1915. </p> <p>Alas, the Nobel committee reflects life. Even though women are 50% of the population, they do not have half the senior positions in science. According to DTI figures, just 9% of professors, wholly funded by their institution, in science, engineering and technology are women, with a shaming 3% in physics. At least physics has the excuse that fewer women enter physics as undergraduates. That's not the case with biological sciences where female intake on some undergraduate courses tops 60%. </p> <p>But until something is done to overcome the barriers, Britain will continue to waste the brain power of most women it educates in the sciences, 75% of whom leave the subject. The UK Resource Centre for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology, run by a consortium led by Bradford College and Sheffield Hallam University, has recently been launched, with substantial funding from the government and the EU. Its aim is to increase the number of women who succeed in science. It is not a moment too soon. Never mind Nobels, just keeping women interested would be a start.</p>",
  "<p>Students will be able to spend their loans and grants on fees at private universities from 2006, the government has said, in a move described by one private university head as the introduction of a \"voucher\" system.</p> <p>Kim Howells, the new higher and further education minister, has written to private university vice-chancellors advising them that their students will be eligible for the same level of support from the government from 2006 when top-up fees are introduced. </p> <p>Terence Kealey, the vice-chancellor of the private Buckingham University, said that the decision marked a new phase of \"generous\" support of private institutions, backed personally by Tony Blair, which could lead to the Russell Group of elite universities \"opting out\" of the state system. </p> <p>Top universities which believe they could justify charging higher rates could establish a new ivy league of private institutions with fees to match, he claimed. </p> <p>Harvard's current undergraduate tuition fee is $27,448 (\u00a315,371) a year. Last week Michael Beloff, the president of Trinity College, Oxford, predicted that the university would go private within 15 years. </p> <p>Universities currently receive student and research funding from the government via the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce). </p> <p>However, if universities felt that they could make more money, by charging higher fees for example, they could privatise, thus forfeiting that money as well as the government rules that go with it, including those which will cap fees at \u00a33,000 from 2006.</p> <p>Buckingham University offers degrees on a two-year basis at the cost of \u00a310,000 and promises 1:10 lecturer-student ratios, but receives no government money for teaching. </p> <p>Private universities can also apply for government research funding via the research councils, though not for funding provided by Hefce.</p> <p>Mr Kealey told EducationGuardian.co.uk: \"Tony Blair has effectively introduced vouchers, what he's done is give subsidies to people going to universities such as Buckingham, allowing the money to follow the student, and it doesn't come with the ties you would get in a directly funded institution. The students have to top-up and that's about as close to a voucher as you can get. </p> <p>He went on: \"I think what Tony Blair has done is create an opportunity for the leading British universities to press for an ivy league if that's what they want. It can be achieved without legislation. We've moving closer and closer to America.\"</p> <p>A series of letters, seen by EducationGuardian.co.uk, confirms the move. One to Buckingham University from Mr Howells, dated September 16, confirms that funding for students in the private and state sector would be \"aligned\" so they could receive the same money and use it in either institution. </p> <p>A second letter, written by the prime minister in February - shortly after the higher education bill's bumpy passage through the Commons - tells Mr Kealey: \"We believe that the independent higher education sector plays an important role in increasing the choice available to students.\"</p> <p>\"Greater independence is a central theme of our HE strategy,\" he added. </p> <p>Geoffrey Alderman, senior vice-president of American InterContinental University in London, which is a private outpost of an American university offering British degrees for \u00a312,000 a year, said: \"British students studying at private institutions for British degrees were always eligible for a certain amount of money. This extends it. </p> <p>\"We're educating British students at no or very little [cost] to the British taxpayer. If these students were not following British degrees here they would presumably going to taxpayer-funded institution. Surely it is right that if we teach a British student to a British standard they should get some support?\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Education and Skills denied that there was any \"hidden agenda\" in the new legislation. </p> <p>\"This is a very transparent policy which is about equality and fairness across all institutions that offer designated higher education courses,\" he said. </p> <p>\"From September 2006 new students starting any designated higher education course at any higher education institution (whether it is funded by Hefce or not) will be given the same deal.</p> <p>\"They will all be able to get a student loan for their fees of up to \u00a33,000 and they will all be eligible for the maintenance grant of up to \u00a32,700. Students on designated courses at private institutes, including Buckingham, have always had access to student support and some help with their tuition fees. \"</p> <p>He added: \"What we are doing is making sure that support is equitable in the light of the variable fee changes in the publicly funded part of the sector.\"</p>",

  "For two nights this week Bob Geldof and Fathers 4 Justice took over our TV screens, spreading their message that bitter exes and unfair courts are preventing caring fathers from seeing their children. Both Geldof and the high-profile campaigning group are adamant that when a relationship breaks down, children are better off if parenting is shared equally. <p>This is at best naive, at worst dangerous. Few would deny that the majority of fathers should play an important role in their child's upbringing, or that it is best for a child to have regular contact with both parents following separation. Reflecting this consensus, the courts refuse to grant a contact order in only 0.8% of cases. With so few fathers refused contact, perhaps we should ask Fathers 4 Justice to explain why they are among this minority? </p> <p>Often the reason for denying contact is domestic violence, an entrenched social problem which affects one in four women during their lifetime and kills two women each week. Domestic violence represents almost a quarter of all recorded violent crime and carries the highest risk for repeat victimisation. Yet, though grim, these statistics do nothing to convey the impact on both women and children of witnessing or experiencing domestic violence. </p> <p>I have met children who shake with fear at the thought of coming face to face with their father. I see mothers who wait on tenterhooks to see if their children are returned after contact, and children terrified that they will inadvertently reveal their mother's whereabouts to their father. </p> <p>In 90% of domestic violence incidents there are children in the same or next room. Both they and their mothers are at risk of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. </p> <p> When a relationship ends and we know domestic violence has occurred, it is our moral duty to protect the children and help them overcome the trauma they have experienced. It is also in our interests: it is no coincidence that many young male offenders grew up in violent homes. </p> <p>It is not good for a child who has witnessed or experienced abuse to be forced into contact with the perpetrator. Children are regularly placed at risk and 23 died between 1994 and 2003 as a result of unsafe contact arrangements with abusive fathers. One woman who came to Refuge took her three-year-old son to the park to meet his father. There were people around. He threatened them with a baseball bat, forced them into his car, and took them to his flat where he beat her. </p> <p>Less extreme, but still damaging to the child, are the many instances where the contact meeting is used as a means of perpetuating control over the family. Seven-year-old Natasha watched her father keep her mother tied up all day, beat her and then shoot her in the stomach. She was adamant she never wanted to see him again but was forced into contact by the court. During contact he would whisper that he would find her and her mother and kill them. </p> <p>Children should not only be safe, they have the right to feel safe from the threat of harm. Michelle, aged 8, was afraid to close her eyes because she could see her father coming to get her \"like in a video\". She knew she did not want to see him. </p> <p>We must listen and take into account children's views when deciding their future. In New Zealand there is a rebuttable presumption of no-contact in cases where domestic violence has occurred. Surely this is the way forward rather than a presumption of shared parenting. A violent father is not a good role model. </p> <p>Geldof suggested that women were quick to claim domestic violence in relationship, and that these claims were difficult to prove. For a variety of reasons, not least shame and the fear of not being believed, most women suffer in silence for long periods. Women are abused an average of 35 times before seeking police support. Given the difficulties of speaking out, abused women do not need to hear that they will be doubted. They need to know that society will say to the perpetrator, \"Stop, or there will be consequences. You will be arrested, charged, prosecuted and convicted. No court will grant you unsupervised contact with your children unless you can prove you are not a danger to them or their mother.\" </p> <p>There is no doubt we should be talking about the impact on children when a relationship breaks down. We should be doing everything to ensure all children have support to overcome that trauma and yes, for most, that will mean shared parenting or at least regular contact with both parents. However, we must not forget the significant numbers of children who depend on us for their protection and emotional wellbeing. We will fail them if we allow a few aggrieved fathers to determine the outcome of that debate. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sandra Horley is chief executive of Refuge </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.refuge.org.uk\">www.refuge.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A doctor who said he could not help having affairs with his patients was struck off the medical register at his own request yesterday morning. \"I have a fundamentally flawed personality which makes me permanently unfit to be in a position of trust as a GP,\" John Razzak wrote to the General Medical Council. \"I have had affairs with patients over which I seem to have no control.\" </p> <p>The formal end to 46-year-old Dr Razzak's career in medicine came just five days after Staffordshire GP Keith Bevan was thrown out of the medical profession for a 14-month affair with a farmer's wife, whom he seduced in his surgery while her husband was sitting in the waiting room. \"She was avid for sex and her husband was happy to watch the telly,\" Bevan, 57, told the GMC hearing which concluded that his behaviour \"undermines the confidence which the public is entitled to place in members of the medical profession and constitutes a gross abuse of your position.\" </p> <p>In July, the GMC ejected Iain MacLeod, a 66-year-old GP who rode around Moffat in Dumfriesshire in a Jaguar with the number plate TSM 1T, which stood for \"The Sexiest Man In Town\". He was struck off over a 22-year affair with a woman he had been treating for depression which, it was said \"contributed to the distress she has suffered over a significant part of her life\". In February, Dr Anthony Leeper, 48, who admitted an 11-month sexual relationship with a patient, escaped with a two-year supervision order. </p> <p>These are just a few of the doctors who have recently got caught. Typically they are middle-aged and male. Research in the US has shown that one-in-10 family doctors has had a sexual relationship with a patient. Having sex with a patient is completely off-limits. Every doctor, certainly in the UK, knows it is a career-ending offence. </p> <p>Yet, medical students who were asked about whether they would have relationships with their patients, for a study published in the Journal of Medical Ethics this month, were equivocal. If they were a GP on a remote Scottish island and were asked, by a patient they had just about finished treating for a skin condition, to come to dinner, in a way that suggested her interest was more than conversation, what would they do? Nearly half (40%) said they couldn't see the harm. </p> <p>Many of us might feel sympathetic. What's a doctor to do on a windswept rock where there might be more sheep than potential partners? But no. John Goldie, an Easterhouse GP and senior tutor at the University of Glasgow, who devised the study, is uncompromising. \"There is a power imbalance in the relationship, it is not a relationship of equals and it can never be,\" he says. It is doubtful, he says, that any patient can ever truly give consent to a sexual relationship with her doctor. </p> <p>This isn't about the sexy registrar with the white coat, gentle hands and impeccable bedside manner. It's not about Carry On Doctor frolics or seductive soap opera GPs. Fiction has frequently woven sex into the life-and-death tapestry of medicine, but the reality features men and women who go to their doctor because of physical and often emotional vulnerability. What they find, from their doctor, is sympathy, care and concern. It can be devastating. </p> <p>Sigmund Freud noted that many of his female patients fell in love with him. He called it transference. What was happening, he said, was that they were casting him as somebody in their past life, projecting on to him the feelings of love and desire that they had experienced for other men. </p> <p>\"If you help a patient who is having problems, they are so grateful they sort of fall in love with you,\" says Claire Rayner, president of the Patients Association. \"They are not, but they think they are. They transfer all their emotions to the person who has helped them. </p> <p>\"Doctors are attractive figures. They have all this knowledge and they care about you and you get the feeling they care more about you than they do. Getting a crush on them is easy. I did it. It has happened to me that I have been looked after really well and thought: 'Oh you are lovely.' \" </p> <p>It happens most with psychiatrists, gynaecologists and GPs - those doctors who spend most time with patients and are likely to talk over problems beyond the physical. But this is not a one-way street. The doctors most likely to have a sexual relationship with a patient are male, middle-aged and may have problems of their own. </p> <p>The damage that can be done is clear from the GMC cases, which will only have got that far because they are the most serious. The woman with whom MacLeod had an affair over two decades was being treated for depression. Dr Leeper's affair was with a patient who came to him with anxiety and emotional problems. The woman Bevan seduced had marital problems and wanted him to prescribe Viagra for her husband, a farmer whose livelihood had been badly hit by foot and mouth disease. </p> <p>In every case, the woman was vulnerable and looking for help. There can be no equal relationship if it is born in the surgery or consulting room, says Dr Goldie. He says there is no way out - asking the patient to switch to another doctor is also unacceptable. \"It's a bit of a grey area,\" he acknowledges, but because the woman was once a patient, transference can have occurred and the power imbalance exists. \"There is no evidence that it disappears,\" he says. </p> <p>In an age when sexuality and sexual expression rule and when marriages last for ever briefer periods, it may be seen as a hair-shirted hard road for the doctor on the remote Scottish island, if not the rest of the profession. But Dr Goldie takes no prisoners: \"With professionalism comes boundaries,\" he said. He says there is a need for much more education and discussion among doctors to help them deal with the doctor/patient relationship, including asking students their attitudes at the start of their training and, if necessary, attempting to change them. Because, at the end of the day, this is not about sex between a man and a woman, but potential - even if unknowing - exploitation of vulnerability. And as Hippocrates said, the first duty of a doctor is to do no harm.</p>",
  "<p>\"J Sainsbury plc, once the great and the good of the stock market, is racking up profit warnings faster than its shelves are restocked,\" noted the <strong> Scotsman</strong>'s Martin Flanagan after Britain's third-largest supermarket group revealed its third downgrade of estimated profits since March on Monday. </p> <p>In a statement, the ailing retailer said that its underlying pre-tax profits for the six months to October would be between \u00a3125m and \u00a3135m - 20% below City forecasts - compared with \u00a3366m in the same period last year. \"Sainsbury's has got itself into a terrible mess, and things will get worse before the year end,\" judged Neil Collins in the <strong> Daily Telegraph</strong>. </p> <p>But the saga did not end there. \"There was a whiff of New Labour around ... events at Sainsbury's with its denials of selective briefings and the spin which redefined a profit warning as a clarification statement,\" said Stephen Kahn in the <strong> Daily Express</strong>. </p> <p>Monday's statement was issued a week before Justin King, the retailer's new chief executive, was due to deliver his business review. He was obliged to announce the warning early, agreed the business pages, because of a Financial Services Authority investigation into the way it had briefed analysts at Merrill Lynch about its potential profitability last Friday. </p> <p>There was no doubt that Sainsbury's talked to the investment bank, said the <strong> Daily Mail</strong>'s Alex Brummer. \"This appears at first sight to be a selective briefing. The information made available to Merrills and its clients was not there for the vast majority of investors.\" And it now appears the investment bank, which is also Tesco's broker, \"may have had a Watergate moment because tapes of the conversations between the broker and the company have gone Awol\", he added. </p> <p>This and Monday's profit warning raised two questions for Jeremy Warner in the <strong> Independent</strong>. Just how much worse can things get at Sainsbury's before they get better? And is it ever acceptable for companies to massage market expectations of their results? \"It is against the listings rules as well as being a potential breach of the law on market abuse for companies selectively to brief analysts or investors on market-sensitive issues,\" said Warner. \"Companies are also obliged to put out a profit warning if it becomes apparent that performance is falling well short of consensus expectations.\" </p> <p>The retailer's credibility was on the line, said the Breaking Views column in the <strong> Wall Street Journal Europe</strong>. This mattered because \"the more the market believes in Mr King, the more time it will be prepared to give him to turn Sainsbury's around.\" </p> <p>Reviving its fortunes would be tough, especially since the \"turnaround strategy\" of Sir Peter Davis, Mr King's predecessor, has proved to be an \"expensive failure\", noted Martin Dickson in the <strong> Financial Times</strong>'s Lombard column. \"Some \u00a33bn was invested in a new distribution system that cannot get the right merchandise on the shelves at the right time, while its pricing has also lost it market share,\" he said. Sainsbury's \"is widely regarded as stuck in the unenviable middle ground - squeezed between upmarket niche operators like Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer, and the dominant value chains - Tesco, Asda and Morrisons\". </p> <p>In the Telegraph, Collins felt next Monday's review was the last chance for Mr King \"to throw in everything including Jamie's kitchen sink, and he would be foolish indeed if he fails to do so. Another profit warning might flush out a bidder.\" </p> <p>Although the controlling family of Sainsbury's owns 38% of the stocks, and can protect the group from a takeover, share price is still \"a major fact in the family's thinking\", said Breaking Views. \"Should observers show they don't believe in the recovery, that could influence the family's view, and this could leave the door open to a predator.\" </p> <p>Hopes of a takeover had helped cushion Sainsbury's share price; it fell by only 2p to 250p by the end of Tuesday. But the <strong> Times</strong>'s Patience Wheatcroft warned that unless something positive emerged on Monday, the price will continue to fall, for \"the prospect of a bid ... now seems even more slender, given the size of the problems.\"</p>",
  "The shots are not quite as loud as you might expect them to be, but still they are too close for comfort. The bullets fly past the head of a shocked Territorial Army soldier and embed themselves in the wall, just inches from where he is standing. A sharp voice shouts: \"Contact to our left, three or four rounds.\" Seconds later, there is a small burst of fire. <p>They call it a contact and what it means is that somebody, somewhere, shot at British troops. It happens every single day in Iraq. Today they think it might be a warning that they have stayed in this area for too long, but in truth they really don't know. It is one of the first forays British sol diers have made into the town of Amara, north of Basra, for quite a while and the locals aren't happy. On the wall of a nearby community centre, a scrawl in red paint reads: \"Dawn No No USA Brtish [sic]\". </p> <p>This group of 12 Territorial Army soldiers from 52 Lowland Regiment Y Company have been escorting a man from the Ministry of Defence to another British-built community centre. The civil servant - known as a political adviser, or \"polad\" for short - has flown up from Basra to check that British government funds are being properly spent. Colour Sergeant Keith Irving from Hawick in the Scottish Borders is in charge of this expedition, and is standing on a street outside the community centre, watching for possible trouble, his SA80 rifle at the ready. He is surrounded by dozens of cheeky-faced children shouting, \"Mister, mister, Saddam donkey,\" while showing him the soles of their feet. But as the convoy pulls off later, the children's faces turn resentful and they start throwing stones. </p> <p>It's just another day for the Territorial Army soldiers serving in Iraq - people who, most of the time, live daily lives every bit as ordinary and banal as yours or mine, but who find themselves, in times of war, called upon to do an extraordinary second job in a very dangerous place. The mobilisation of reservists for the war in Iraq was the biggest since the Suez Crisis, and it continues to grow through the postwar phase. There are 1,210 Territorial Army soldiers serving on Op Telic 4, as the current operation in Iraq is known, making up 14% of the 8,069-strong British force. Roughly 10% of the TA contingent are female, many of them nurses. </p> <p>As the British army has come to rely ever more heavily on part-time soldiers, the contrast between the jobs they do at home and what they do in \"theatre\", as the military call the Iraqi conflict zone, has become more striking than ever. There is the Calor Gas tanker driver who is currently gathering intelligence; the joiner who runs a job creation scheme for Iraqi people; the marketing officer for the National Archive at Kew who now spends his days trying to liaise with public service officials; as well as the mechanics, plumbers and City analysts doing guard duty. Then there are those on a busman's holiday of sorts: the two electricity specialists working on the Basra power grid; the doctors and nurses working in the military field hospital; the chefs now preparing meals for thousands of soldiers stationed in the desert. </p> <p>The soldiers from 52nd Lowland Regiment have spent most of their time in Iraq on force protection, interspersed with what they consider the more boring job - guard duty. They are coming to the end of their six-month stint in Amara and their morale is still pretty high. At home, they belong to various TA units, training in their different bases in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Ayr and other towns across Scotland during the week, coming together as a brigade at periodic short residential camps. While they may have met each other's wives and families at dances and other TA events, they don't like to talk about home too much. </p> <p>Irving, the broad-accented Scotsman, is typical of the TA soldiers here in that he believes that he is just as professional as any regular in the field. He served in the regulars for five years, then signed up with the TA 10 years after leaving the forces. \"Having seen it from both sides of the fence, I think commitment-wise the TA guy is the better soldier,\" he says. We are standing outside a British-funded blacksmith's shop. Inside, the owner is telling the MoD man that he is now employing five members of his family because of the funds he received to kit out his workshop. The MoD man is happy, even though this marks just a small success in terms of the British attempt to help rebuild the country. </p> <p>Outside on the street there is a perception that the tension is mounting. The road is busy with cars and bicycles and people, all of them staring: most don't look particularly friendly. It's not the numbers on the street you need to worry about, says Irving, it's when the crowd suddenly disappears that you know something might go wrong. I ask him if he ever gets scared. He shrugs his shoulders and quips: \"Wit's for ye will no go by ye,\" a fatalistic Scottish expression which means whatever happens happens. In his other life, Irving delivers medical oxygen across the Borders of Scotland. </p> <p> *** </p> <p>Another day, another scene. It is just past 7am and a watery sun is burning a hazy white light across the flat landscape that British soldiers have taken to calling the \"Gifa\". Territorial army fusilier Michael Greville explains that it means the \"great Iraqi fuck all\". </p> <p>Greville is 26, and usually works as a credit analyst for Cazenove, a city investment bank. It's an office-bound job and most days he finds himself by a computer. In Iraq, when he is not soldiering, he goes back to his accommodation to study his notes for the chartered financial analyst exam which he hopes to take next year: \"When I am really bored, which is pretty much 12 hours a day when we are not working, I go back to my room and study.\" Being here means he is missing out on his city bonuses, but Greville is enjoying the tour anyway. </p> <p>This morning some of Four Platoon from Messines Company, the London Regiment, are on their way north, escorting three vehicles from the British divisional headquarters at Basra airbase to the Dutch army camp near the town of Samawa, south of the flashpoint city of Najaf. Like 52 Lowland, they provide armed escort and covering fire should the convoy of regular troops meet any insurgency on the road. </p> <p>They may work alongside the regulars, but ultimately all the TA soldiers in Iraq are under the command of the British Forces General Officer Commanding Major General Rollo, who is a regular soldier. Those serving with Messines Company are led by a TA Major Conrad Giles whilst those attached to a regular regiment such as the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment take orders from a regular commanding officer. The TA frequently provides protection for regular soldiers who are not fighting on the frontline but who have to move around southern Iraq. In such situations the regular soldier must obey the TA unit's senior ranking soldier. </p> <p>In this instance it is Colour Sergeant Rob Denman, and he is calling out orders through the radio to the two guys in each of the vehicles whose heads are sticking out through a hole in the roof to provide covering fire. They are known as \"top cover\" and find themselves in one of the most exposed situations of all the military - a number of the recent deaths and injuries in Iraq amongst British troops were of soldiers doing top cover. </p> <p>Up top, one soldier faces the front and another the back, one with an SA80, one with a Minimi light machine gun, both looking for a possible threat. They cautiously keep their eyes open for snipers, mortar teams, rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) and the particularly lethal improvised explosive devices, IEDs, that can be left on the side of the road and detonated some distance away by remote control. If the convoy stops or slows for too long, they must dismount and try to move the trafficon while at the same time watching out for potential assaults. The rebels in the south have yet to use the suicide car bombs seen in Baghdad, but the soldiers are anxious that they soon could. </p> <p>\"Just so you are aware, there's one pax [person] standing up on that flatbed coming towards us,\" says Denman. \"As we move up the MSR [main supply route] make sure the vehicles are tight. I don't want no civvies in between us.\" The previous night, another Messines Company force protection team was the target of an RPG, which shot through the gap between two of their vehicles. They need to stay close. </p> <p>Nicknamed the Colourman because of his rank, Denman is 37 and works as a principal officer at Wandsworth prison. An hour and a half outside of Basra, he spots a cloud of black smoke up ahead. He tells the boys to approach slowly. They soon realise it's a traffic accident involving a Dutch military vehicle and a local car. </p> <p>Three Iraqis have died in the accident (the casualties were quickly removed by locals), but the Dutch soldiers have been standing by the side of the road for a while apparently doing nothing to police the situation. \"Maybe they are in shock,\" says Denman. He jumps down from his wagon and orders his soldiers to enact the drill they have trained for to deal with this situation. Denman starts to set up a vehicle checkpoint and control the traffic; the rest of the guys are sent to guard the peripheral area. An hour and a half later, the Dutch \"quick reaction force\" arrives and he can stand his men down. \"It's not very quick, the quick reaction force, is it?\" someone pipes up. \"Yesh, we have just come from Camp Shpliffy,\" cracks another. The Dutch, whose camp is called Smitty, are the butt of a lot of British jokes. </p> <p>Denman calls his boys \"the PlayStation generation\" because \"all they can use is their thumbs\", but really, he admits, \"I think they are the mutts' nuts because they bring all their outside experience to the job - and today they showed that the TA can do the same job as the regular army.\" </p> <p>In the team - as well as the prison officer, the nurse, and the City boy - are: Lance Corporal Ander Broadman, 30, who procures engineering works for Network Rail and missed out on a vital promotion by being in Iraq; private Ed Elliott, nicknamed Billy (as in Billy Elliott), who works for JP Morgan Fleming in the city and \"likes this sort of stuff, it's a break from delays on the Northern Line and fixing the photocopier\"; Private Tom Kelly, nicknamed Forceps because of the shape of his skull, who drives a HGV lorry for the Post Office; Dean \"Deano\" Moore, a shaven-headed joker of a joiner from Belfast; and Private Tim \"Watesy\" Wates, a recently-redundant recruitment consultant who joined the TA \"to shoot stuff. Not people, but to shoot off weapons, the feel, the sound, the power, there's a huge adrenalin rush: it's boys' toys\". </p> <p>Pace, who could have been a medic in the TA but preferred to join the infantry, says: \"It's like training for a football match and wanting to play. I didn't want to train and just use blanks in a forest somewhere. We do use live rounds when we are training sometimes in the UK but there's a different apprehension about it.\" Wates pipes in: \"That's what gives it the edge, you know there are people out there wanting to kill you.\" </p> <p> *** </p> <p>Britain has a long history of reserve forces, with Volunteer and Yeomanry units being formed during the Napoleonic wars. The TA was established in 1907. First known as the Territorial Force, it encouraged Britons to join in \"homeland defence\": the word territorial signified that those who served with the force were under no obligation to serve overseas. By 1921 it had changed its name to the Territorial Army. In the first world war, a number TA units volunteered to go to war and did not come back for four years, bringing back 71 Victoria Crosses for bravery. </p> <p>With the abolition of national service and the advent of the cold war, it seemed the TA's role was assured, but with the fall of the iron curtain, the security of the homeland was deemed to be under rather less of a threat. The Conservatives cut TA numbers by 15,000 between 1991 and 1994, then the present government scythed the numbers further from 54,000 to 41,000 as part of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review. The then defence secretary George Robertson said: \"The TA should no longer be a force of last resort, held against a major conventional threat to the UK and Nato allies. More units will be placed at significantly higher states of readiness. And we will now be prepared to call them up - in formed units if needs be - in situations that fall short of a direct threat to the UK such as the Gulf war.\" This would, he added, give them a \"more heavyweight role\". The 40,000-strong TA now forms 25% of the British army, and can be called on to provide the army with entire formed units, or to supply individual specialists as required in IT, logistics, medicine, communications and other areas. </p> <p>Almost all of them, while essentially volunteers, have been compulsorily mobilised (the MoD calls it \"intelligent mobilisation\", insisting that it accommodates people who can prove it would be impossible for them to go for professional or personal reasons). The Reserve Forces Act 1996 obliges all employers to keep a TA soldier's job open but some have returned from Iraq to find this isn't the case. At least 17 are believed to be taking their former employers to tribunals after losing their jobs upon their return. </p> <p>Compared to the training undergone by regular soldiers, the territorials' induction can seem light. Soldiers attend training on three evenings each month, and commit themselves to one Sunday a month, and six weekends and two full weeks camp a year, which they must take out of their annual work leave. For these hours they are paid the same as a regular soldier of equivalent rank, ranging from \u00a329.10 a day for a private to \u00a3102.51 for a major. Each year they are awarded a tax-free bounty of between \u00a3350 and \u00a31,380 depending on length of service and on passing an annual battlefield weapons and fitness test. While they are mobilised, their salaries from their employers are suspended. The theory goes that a TA soldier on active service will be no worse off than he or she would be at home but sometimes this doesn't work out: a City trader can't expect to get his or her bonuses, but will get their mortgage and other \"reasonable\" outgoings covered. </p> <p>Inevitably, the \"Terries\" take a ribbing from both civilians and the regular army for \"playing\" at being soldiers, a dads' army of weekend warriors. The comedian Jack Dee recently described members of the TA as \"part-time soldier, full-time banging on about it\", while the best-known fictional TA member, Gareth from the Office, never lets his own service go forgotten: \"A lot of people think that the Territorial Army are not real soldiers. We are. We are well trained, highly disciplined fighting machines ready for war. We're just not available during the week.\" </p> <p>\"Until the TA changes their courses to six weeks like the regular army we will never be seen as the same as them,\" says one soldier from 52nd Lowland. \"But it takes them six weeks to do a course that takes us two weeks because they are not as brainy as us. That's why when regular guys leave the army the best job they can get is as a security adviser. But TA guys are different.\" In addition, the concept of rank can work rather differently with the territorials. Often, highly qualified civilians prefer to remain privates in what they see as a break from responsibility. Better educated, white-collar professionals often find themselves taking orders from someone who comes from a blue-collar background. </p> <p>Certainly there can be a marked difference in culture between regular and territorial units. Last year, I was embedded with a squadron of regular soldiers during the invasion of Iraq. Spending time with the TA in a similar situation, it seemed to me that the diversity and breadth of experience that these men and women had gained in their normal daily lives gave them more interesting things to talk about than their regular counterparts - and a rather different view of their involvement in the conflict. Most had signed up for the TA out of a sense of patriotism and duty, but they are far from army machines; as one, who had copies of The Spanish Civil War and The Rise and Fall of the British Empire by his bed, told me: \"I am a historian and I suppose I am in love with the romanticism of it all.\" Another did not believe the war was justified but enjoyed the adventure of it. </p> <p>Denman has been in the TA for 14 years - \"promoted and demoted a couple of times\" - and got his call-up papers for Iraq in January 2004. It was a blow to his wife Sandy and his two children, Amy, 11, and James, 7, but he has worked every other weekend as a prison officer so he is used to missing key family moments. He has gone on exercise to Estonia, Germany, Cyprus and Romania, but Iraq is his first proper tour of duty. With a few qualms, he says, he would be happy to come back for another. \"It's given me an outlet physically, getting out and not being surrounded by walls, a feeling of not being hemmed in. </p> <p>Like other soldiers, Denman has his own opinion about the war, but out here considers it irrelevant. \"I look at it the same way I do in the prison service: I am paid by society to carry out a task. I am paid to be a prison officer and to lawfully detain people and out here I am paid to be a soldier and follow the orders of my commanding officer and carry out foreign policy.\" </p> <p>His worst day in Iraq, he says, was when he went to the field hospital at Shaiba Logistics Base and saw a 22-year-old private from his company being fed through a straw. He had received a shrapnel wound in his throat when an IED exploded under his vehicle. \"Because I am a platoon sergeant I feel really, really responsible,\" says Denman. \"In a way you are a father figure; I feel responsible for my blokes. When you have been through all the training and the camaraderie and you see someone you don't want to see hurt hurt it makes you angry.\" </p> <p> *** </p> <p>This kind of attack has become more frequent in the British-controlled south since August, when Moqtada al-Sadr declared a holy war on British troops. It is now very rare to see British soldiers on the ground in their soft berets, a style of dress that was much trumpeted by the MoD in the days immediately after the war. The British claim they still have 90% of public consent, but it doesn't seem like that on the ground. </p> <p>The battle group further north in Amara, for instance, has been under the most sustained attack of any British unit since the Korean war, with 881 mortar rounds being fired at them since April. It is estimated that the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment has fired 30,000 rounds of ammunition, more than was used by all troops in the invasion phase last year. In August, the former family home of the governor of Maysan province used by the British as the headquarters of their civil and military cooperation unit (known as \"Cimic House\") came under siege; during one 10-day period, 428 mortars were fired at it. The 100 or so soldiers there - a high percentage of them TA - had to sit and battle it out. </p> <p>Hanging out in the humid, malodorous tent that is their home in Abu Naji camp, five miles outside Amara city centre, some of Colour Sergeant Irving's \"jocks\" (as the infantry privates in the 52 Lowland are known) recall the three-week battle of Cimic House. One soldier filmed the engagement: the camera tracks red tracer fire as it thrashes across the sky towards the building and then back out in returning fire. The subtitles count the 595 mortars, 10% of which landed within the perimeter: 57 RPG attacks, five 107mm rocket attacks and 86 small arms engagements. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't say it was horrific,\" says Fusilier Derek Currie. \"It was mad. A mortar knocked our sanger [an elevated guard post on the edge of camp] and deafened me for 8 hours.\" Currie is 21 and from Glasgow. In his normal life he works with children in after-school care: \"I do training, I do workshops with new employers, I organise sports days.\" Private David McCauley, 29, works in a call centre for the Manpower employment agency. \"It's not scary at the time but you sit down after and go, oh God, that was a bit hairy.\" </p> <p>But a boy with chipmunk teeth pipes up that it's \"brilliant\". Private Craig Hardie is 24 and a mechanic from Kelso, and he loves all this. He joined the TA 18 months ago, around the time of the fall of Saddam Hussein. Having trained in battlefield first aid he is the team medic, and the boys have stuck the label \"witch doctor\" above his campbed. This kind of engagement, he says, is \"what we join the TA for\". </p> <p>But however much it may seem to some like a great game, these boys, unlike many of the territorials in Iraq, have killed people. They know it should bother them, but at the time, when the killing was done, it just didn't. \"They shoot first: it's them or us,\" says McCauley. \"I would rather go home and see my two kids. If you slot someone, they are usually quite a distance away, so surprisingly, when you see them fall over, it doesn't really affect you that much since they were firing at us first.\" </p> <p>They say they are not worrying now about post-traumatic stress, or the many other psychological scars they may carry back to nine-to-five civilian lives. \"Most of us here will be OK because we talk to each other about it,\" says McCauley. \"I have been [nearby] when a mortar has hit a civilian's house and the first thing I have heard is a woman screaming, a sound you would never want to hear. I might not forget that.\" </p> <p>Later, a regular soldier tells me a story about being at Cimic House. \"I was on top of the Pink Palace with Keith [Irving] and we were crouched behind a really low parapet. I was shitting myself. I was on my belt buckle [lying down]. And Keith's up there with his rifle mounted over the parapet, bullets whizzing past him on either side and he's looking at me going: 'When your time's up you time's up.'\" He adds admiringly: \"And he's in the TA.\" Irving is not much of a stickler for ranks and titles. He and his sergeant Gordon Wylie, a plumber affectionately known as \"Wee Speccy\", believe that it is good for morale for the men to talk to each other like friends. </p> <p>That night, at 1am, a loud bang, followed by a dull thud, shudders the ground on the eastern perimeter. Ten 107mm rockets - \"a beast of a munition\", says Irving - have landed and detonated. They are met by outgoing rounds from a Warrior tank. Just another contact, but this time the assault is much more sustained and it comes as a shock to TA Corporal Lisa Lovell, who is in the Royal Military Police. Sitting up in bed, a worried look on her face, she tells me that this is the most scared she has felt on her tour. She is a solicitor from Newcastle and thinks this fear may be because her time here is coming to an end. The soldiers believe that this is statistically the time when something bad might happen to them because they are apt to let their guard down. </p> <p> *** </p> <p> Last month, the British moved out of Cimic House and handed it back to the Iraqis. Much of the work they were doing is now carried out from a cabin they call Cimic Hut that sits at the gates of Abu Naji; trips out of base are now very limited. On a table inside the hut sits a thick green file with the words \"Compensation Claims\" written on its spine. Sergeant William Cooper is looking at a photograph of a hole made in a wall by an RPG. A local woman, Jinan Salman Mohammed, hands over a photocopy of her identity card and a form which says, in English: \"My house was bombed during the events between Al-Sadr militias and British forces by shelling by British army.\" In a box she details the damage and how much she reckons it will cost to build again. \"Air conditioning, $400, bricks $250, sink and paint and glasses and basin with valves and mixer, $140, cement and sand, $300. Total: $1,340 US.\" </p> <p>Cooper says it seems a pretty fair assessment - \"sometimes, for damage to buildings they are trying for $10,000\" - but says it is not clear who is to blame. \"A lot of them bring these claims but they are not really sure who fired. We are trying to tell them that if we do fire any rockets or missiles it is all regulated and documented and we will know if it was us.\" In the past week they have had 30 claims for rocket damage. </p> <p>Sitting beside him, Lance Corporal Dougie Telford, a swimming pool lifeguard from Motherwell, is looking at a set of photographs showing damage to a car and getting angry. \"I saw this photograph yesterday with another claimant. Fuck off. I want other pictures, I want a court report.\" The young man's claim for damages astounds him. \"An air conditioning unit for $6,372. You can build a house for $2,500 and you are trying to claim $6,372.\" The boy laughs when he hears the interpreter's translation. They add the claim to the pile. </p> <p>Later, Telford holds up an x-ray and says: \"This is a compensation claim. The person says they have been hit by shrapnel.\" In the middle of the negative is a distinctive foreign body lodged in the gut. \"Look, it's a bloody safety pin.\" </p> <p>Today, a frustrated crowd of 350 men have been hanging around since dawn. This assembly has been going on for a few days now, since the rumour spread that they were hiring people at the camp and recruiting for the new Iraqi police force. It's not true, but still the desperate turn up; an enterprising man hunkers down on his knees beside the crate of cola he has hauled for miles to sell to them. Lack of jobs is probably the most serious issue in Amara. \"The pot is starting to boil again and it is all about unemployment,\" predicts one intelligence officer. </p> <p>Several soldiers tell me they are enjoying their time in Iraq, but many members of the TA detest their assignments. One senior regular officer admits that the TA very often get the less exciting jobs, particularly the monotonous guard duty, day in day out. This is because his men - the \"real soldiers\" he slips, before quickly correcting himself with \"regular soldiers\" - are career soldiers who have to think about promotion and the jobs they have to do in order to secure it. </p> <p>Nor are the conditions in which they are serving in any way hospitable. Abu Naji is the worst of the British camps in terms of living conditions: there isn't much to do here apart from be a soldier. There are no TV lounges or bars like the other camps, and no air conditioning in the junior ranks' cookhouse. In the height of summer the fetid 60 degree air is thick with flies. </p> <p>Corporal Malcolm \"Beachy\" Grieve is a 43-year-old slaughterman whose daily life involves cutting through animal carcasses in an abattoir in Selkirk in the Scottish Borders. He was mobilised in February and is extremely unhappy in Abu Naji. He joined the TA 14 years ago, he says, \"to be part of a team and get the extra coin, it was good money at the time\"- and until Iraq he loved it. This is his first deployment and, apart from the TA annual two-week camp, the first time he has been away from his family. His wife Theresa was \"very upset and didn't want me to gang [go]\". A small man with a large paunch and decorously tattooed arms, he has been assigned to stores and so instead of soldiering he is gofering: \"I go for coffee, I go for salmon, I go for corned beef.\" </p> <p>Sitting in the Portakabin-type accommodation that he shares with Telford and Cooper, he says he was originally brought out as a driver of what are called \"white fleet\" vehicles, unarmed 4X4s. But the situation in the Amara area has since escalated, and the white fleet never go out any more. Hence the gofering. </p> <p>\"For the first three months we were battered from pillar to post - guards, convoys, whatever they could fit us into - which was a bit of a disappointment because I would rather have gone back to my own company. Really, I thought they had nothing for us to do. If anybody said to me, 'What do you think of the tour?' I would say it's been the biggest waste of nine months of my life, because I have never done anything constructive to help the Iraqis.\" </p> <p>Beachy's other big complaint, aside from boredom, is money. He is missing out on his bonuses and funds at home are tight. \"Naturally, working in a slaughterhouse, there's no need for the wife to buy butcher meat and that. With four bairns that's quite a lot of money. Every job has got its perks but the army doesn't appreciate that.\" He asked to get back home in October so that he could be back at work in time to earn some money for Christmas. TA soldiers are allowed 40 days leave upon their return but many, like Beachy, can't afford to take it. </p> <p>Then there's what he sees as the lack of support for his wife. \"I'm lucky because I have a big family around about my wife but there has been no information or support for her. I think the army should help them, the wives have not got a clue. What does the wife do if she's got depression or that?\" </p>",
  "The Israeli army yesterday suspended an officer who is accused of firing up to 20 bullets into a 13-year-old Palestinian as she lay on the ground after having been shot from an army outpost. <p>Another schoolgirl died yesterday after being shot while sitting at her school desk. </p> <p>The deaths were in the southern Gaza Strip, some miles away from an ongoing army operation which have seen more than 100 Palestinians killed, including many civilians. </p> <p>The Israeli army suspended the platoon commander when several soldiers threatened to refuse to serve under him if he was not removed. The soldiers told Israeli media that the officer ignored warnings that a person approaching an army outpost last week was a schoolgirl. </p> <p>After she was shot, he approached Imam al Hamas, 13, as she lay on the ground and fired two bullets at her body before emptying the contents of his rifle magazine into her, the soldiers said. </p> <p>Colonel Eyal Eisenberg, an army commander in Gaza, told Israel Army Radio that he had suspended the platoon commander pending an investigation. Col Eisenberg said this would be conducted quickly and that there would be no whitewash. </p> <p>The second schoolgirl, Ghadeer Mokheimer, 10, died of injuries sustained on Tuesday at her UN-run school in Khan Yunis. </p> <p>It was the second time in recent weeks that a schoolgirl had been killed at her desk by Israeli gunfire, said Peter Hansen, head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA. </p> <p>\"That two young children have been shot and killed, sitting at their desks in UNRWA schools in the last month is horrific ... schools should be havens of peace,\" he said. </p> <p>The Israeli army said the incident followed the firing of homemade mortars at a Jewish settlement. </p> <p>Elsewhere in Gaza, the army continued its operation to stop the firing of Qassam rockets into Israel. Militants fired two which fell near the town of Sderot without causing any damage. </p> <p>Tanks moved deeper into the town of Beit Lahiya and three militants were killed and seven Palestinians were wounded in the fighting, including four children between the ages of 5 and 16. </p> <p>Early this morning, a Hamas militant was killed in an Israeli missile strike in the Jabaliya refugee camp. Israel also said it had arrested a West Bank leader, Imad al-Kawasme, that it suspects of masterminding suicide bombings in Beerscheba in August that killed 16. </p>",
  "<p> <strong> Pro Evolution Soccer 4</strong><br> PS2, \u00a339.99 Konami<br> **** </p> <p> One perk of this job is getting to play games before release. Friends are not impressed when this involves the latest F1 sim, but tell them the new Pro Evolution Soccer has arrived and they're banging down the door. You can't blame them: Pro Evo has consistently been the only football game that matters. </p> <p>It is the only one that feels like football and the only one you can play for a year and still find new ways to score. Unfortunately, a lack of official team licences and a combination of amateurish presentation and arcane menus has meant the game has always been outsold by the glossy Fifa series. This time around, things have improved. There are more official licences and the menus are slightly more navigable. But it's still not good enough and desperately needs an overhaul. </p> <p>Luckily, the action on the pitch is as good as ever. Pro Evo is still the best footy game around, basically because it lets you play any way you want. The cruel and random nature of football is replicated, with deflections, last-minute winners and ground-out away wins all possible. Intelligent artificial intelligence means team-mates make clever runs into space as well as tracking back. </p> <p>Xbox owners will want to wait for their version - due in November - as it will be online for the first time. Pro Evo 4 is still top of the league but Fifa, and particularly its online implementation, is closing in. Complacency is not an option for Pro Evo 5. <br> <strong> Greg Howson</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Donkey Konga </strong><br> GameCube, \u00a339.99 (includes bongos) Nintendo/Namco <br> **** </p> <p> Although the Dancing Stage dance mat is the most well-known of the rhythm-action peripherals on the market in the UK, a host have been released here, such as Sega's Samba De Amigo, Konami's BeatMania and Guitar Freaks. Nintendo now brings us a Pal edition of its latest crazy rhythm-action game, Donkey Konga, which comes with bongo drums. </p> <p>While it takes imagination to pretend the peripheral that came with Guitar Freaks was a guitar, at least the bongos look real. Consequently, it's a lot of fun playing along to the music and you don't look as silly. </p> <p>Tunes include Queen's Don't Stop Me Now and the Hungarian Dance No 5 in G Minor! There are more conventional numbers such as Oye Como Va and mixes of classic Nintendo game themes. This eclectic mix belies the fact that the game seems aimed more at the family than the average gamer. </p> <p>Yet Donkey Konga has challenges: there are three difficulty levels, plus jam modes where you have to recall the right drum beats for each song. You can also plug in up to four bongo sets. Donkey Konga is pure fun, good party entertainment and the bongos will also come in handy for playing DK: Jungle Beats next year. <br> <strong> Rhianna Pratchett</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Tony Hawk's Underground 2</strong> <br> PS2, Xbox, GameCube, PC, \u00a339.99 Neversoft/Activision <br> **** </p> <p> Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is the videogame franchise that will not die. By rights, its sixth incarnation should be so tired it makes you cringe. The fact that it doesn't pays tribute to Neversoft's canny powers of reinvention, and the franchise's enduring gameplay. </p> <p>The plot dictates that Tony Hawk and Jackass's Bam Margera captain underground skateboarding teams that earn points for puerile stunts such as pelting pedestrians with rotten tomatoes. The new levels and goals are excellent, with plenty of variation and more destructible environments. You can also unlock secret characters with bizarre vehicles capable of enormous jumps. </p> <p>Another innovation is a slow-motion \"focus control\", which proves handy when attempting to land complex combos. You can also scan your face into the game using Sony's Eye Toy, and play human opposition online. Best of all, there is a Classic Mode, which lets you play the new levels (and some old ones) in the style of the original games. <br> <strong> Steve Boxer</strong> </p>",

  "<p>It is a story with components that would have most conspiracy theorists running for the nearest tinfoil hat shop: a radical media organisation, the FBI and an apparently anonymous foreign government. </p> <p>Last week, Rackspace, a hosting company with headquarters in Texas, handed two of its London-based web servers to the FBI after a subpoena for their contents was issued by a US district court. The servers contained material belonging to the Independent Media Centre - better known as <a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org\">Indymedia</a> - a conglomeration of global radical anti-globalisation sites produced by ordinary citizens. Indymedia claims it was not informed of the decision to seize its content, nor has it been told the reasons, despite the fact that 20 sites and more than 1m pieces of content were affected. </p> <p>The FBI has said it was acting on behalf of a foreign government, though for the American subpoena to have power in the UK, it would need approval from either the British courts or the home secretary. Such agreements would usually be made over investigations into terrorism, though nobody involved has been able to confirm this. </p> <p>Rackspace said it is complying with a court order \"which establishes procedures for countries to assist each other in investigations such as international terrorism, kidnapping and money laundering\". Clearly, such serious allegations against any media organisation - even one produced by amateurs - could be devastating. </p> <p>\"The site crashed last Thursday at 4pm,\" says one Indymedia UK volunteer who asked to remain anonymous. \"Since then, the only official communication we've had was from Rackspace, but they would only say they couldn't tell us what was going on. No one at the FBI has talked to us about this, and we have not been told anything.\" </p> <p>With the situation shrouded in a legal fog, the often-controversial grassroots news organisation has struggled to operate its sites across countries including the UK, France, Belgium, Serbia, Portugal, Italy and parts of South America. </p> <p>\"This seizure has grave implications for free speech and privacy,\" says Kurt Opsahl, staff attorney of Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights campaign group working with Indymedia to uncover the root of the FBI action. </p> <p>It is not the first time Indymedia has come to blows with law enforcement. During the G8 summit in Genoa three years ago, buildings used by Indymedia journalists were among those raided by Italian police. Computers were destroyed and equipment seized in an action that international press watchdog Reporters Sans Frontieres described as unprecedented and incredibly violent. </p> <p>Founded as an anti-globalisation news source covering the protests against the World Trade Organisation summit held in Seattle in 1999, Indymedia quickly turned into an international network of citizen journalists. It provides a voice of underground political opinion around the world, though its open door policy has seen the occasional publication of unsavoury and offensive content, including anti-semitism and incitement to violence - though representatives are quick to disown these. </p> <p>The latest raid is more than just emblematic of the conflict between one radical anti-government organisation and the establishment. It highlights the potential for conflict between law enforcement agencies and citizen publishers and sends a warning to anyone involved in web publishing operations. </p> <p>\"Certainly on face value it looks like an attempt to gag an independent media organisation,\" says Barry Hugill, a spokesman for civil liberties organisation Liberty. \"It is just possible that there is a legitimate reason for this action, but we certainly need more clarification.\" </p> <p>At a time when mainstream media is being opened up to the masses, such crackdowns deal a blow to citizen journalism. Threats to the freedom of web publishers could damage the amateur investigators and webloggers who are the lifeblood of independent online journalism. The lack of information given about these seizures raises the potential threat that anyone could see their content removed without warning or explanation. It shows how fragile internet publishing can be - even in the hands of major media organisations. </p> <p>\"It is easy to go after the provider or the hosting company to close down a website,\" says Yaman Akdeniz, the director of <a href=\"http://www.cyber-rights.org\">Cyber Rights and Civil Liberties</a> and a lecturer at the University of Leeds cyberlaw research unit. \"Unfortunately, arbitrary censorship exists. There are less risky places to publish information and there are more risky places.

  "<p>When it comes to Julie Andrews, you either get it or you don't. Notice of my interview with her prompts two responses: disinterest bordering on hostility from my straight, male friends, and hysteria from everyone else. People scream and hop about and, throwing their eyes to the back of their heads, collapse to the floor. In a small, sad voice my best friend says: \"Give Julie our love.\" </p> <p>\"Aaaah,\" says Andrews, in a suite in the Dorchester Hotel. \"That's so nice. Tell them I'm very grateful.\" She smiles, displaying perfect Julie teeth. </p> <p>Affection for Andrews has grown in the 40-odd years since The Sound of Music was made, to the extent that she is one of the few Brits to rival the status of America's biggest stars. With impeccable manners, she always attributes this to luck and to the fact that, because she is lodged in people's childhood memories, she is almost impossible to eradicate. It has also to do with a kind of sincerity: some stars survive by changing with the times, Andrews has thrived by resisting them. </p> <p>Her new film, The Princess Diaries 2, attempts to bring Andrews into line with more modern entertainment values. It is the sequel to the 2001 hit based on Meg Cabot's fairy tale about a grungy American teen who inherits the crown to Genovia, a European state of which Andrews is head. The first film had a rough, joyful energy about it which is missing from the second, a thoroughly market-tested product. Six-year-old girls will love it. </p> <p>\"You know what, it's got some nice subtle messages,\" says Andrews crisply. \"A lot of films seem to go to the lowest common denominator. And this one is talking about responsibility and growing up and assuming your destiny and your life and all of that. It's not a bad message. And being decent; being decent to people.\" She is very emphatic about decency. </p> <p>The power of Andrews' early roles makes watching her in anything else unsettling, particularly now, given her failure to age in line with the rest of the population. She is 69, but could be 20 years younger. The director, Garry Marshall, tries to address this by making veiled references to Andrews' career history (\"I've done a bit of flying in my time,\" says her character at one stage, nodding to Mary Poppins.) It is Disney's little joke and one, I sense, that Andrews does not entirely approve of. \"It was just a nudge,\" she says, smiling gamely but with underlying waspishness. Her image is often mistakenly identified as \"sweet\", but there is a steeliness to her which goes beyond the usual fortifications of the famous. </p> <p>It is Andrews' voice that has defined her. It never came easily. She always had to warm it up and was envious of those who could burst effortlessly into song. \"As my mother said, I never sprang out of bed with a glad shout! My voice needed oiling and then it took off.\" Since a disastrous throat operation eight years ago, Andrews has been unable to sing. But she speaks with the same precise delivery she brought to her songs. Her words are like beads of mercury: they don't run together. When she refers to Tony Walton, for example, her first husband and father of her grown-up daughter Emma, she pronounces \"ex-spouse\" with a pause in the middle to distinguish the two \"S\" sounds. It has taken her 40 years of living in the States to cave in and pronounce \"laugh\" (as in, \"to laugh like a brook as it trips and falls / over stones on its way (on its way)\") - with the short, American \"a\". Since she comes from Walton-on-Thames, it is always assumed that she has had elocution. But Andrews' diction is the result of her singing lessons, on the foundations of which her whole manner is built. </p> <p>\"I had a teacher who stressed for me the importance of diction in terms of ... I want to be very careful about how I say this ... in terms of supporting one's voice when one is singing. In other words, if you hold on to your words, your voice will pull through for you when you're singing. So be true to your vowels.\" Be true to your vowels! Andrews gives an example: \"Supposing you have to sing [from the Messiah] \"Behold thy king cometh unto thee.\" If you do a strong \"thee\", it will help you with the \"-hold\", which is a much higher note. And it's the note before the note that matters, then you unpeel a song backwards.\" She puts equal emphasis on a song's lyrics as on the melody and it limits what numbers she can sing. \"I tried singing a lovely song called Feelings - do you remember an old song called Feelings?\" She croaks a few bars. \"It has a lot of Oh-oh-ohs in it, and it just completely escaped me. I couldn't get my head around the message of the song. It didn't work at all.\" </p> <p>It was her stepfather, Ted Andrews, who got her into singing, one of the few things she has to be grateful to him for. When her mother remarried, she was forced for reasons of respectability to change her name. Her real name is Julia Wells. She used to imagine as a child that, if she grew up to be a novelist, she would combine her middle name with her real surname to sign herself Elizabeth Wells. Was her real dad annoyed about the name change? </p> <p>\"I suspect he was. He was such a honeybun. He was a really decent, honest ... a ... a nature- loving man. He gave me the grounding. My mother gave me all the sort of chari...\" She stops short of saying \"charisma\", as if curbing an unseemly spurt of ego. \"Flair, or whatever,\" she mutters, \"and I don't hold a candle to her, she was wonderful. But my dad was the sane one, really. He treated the kids as beloved equals. He was a teacher and a good one.\" </p> <p>Ted Andrews, by contrast, was a song and dance man and an alcoholic. The family was dysfunctional, she says, to the extent that in her 20s she had a lot of therapy to remedy the fallout from it. \"They gave me as normal a childhood as possible but it certainly wasn't ... I didn't know what normal was in those days. I was working from a very early age. So, I probably missed out on some of those things ... God knows every family has its problems.\" </p> <p>I ask if her step-dad was violent. \"Yeah,\" she says, \"there were times when he was.\" There is a long pause. She sighs. \"He was kind of a very sad man. I have to say I have great compassion for him, because he had a tough life himself, although at the time it didn't make much difference to me. You can imagine, I had this lovely dad, I didn't like my stepdad, and I wasn't going to accept him. And I mean, he tried. But his demons got in the way. So.\" Another pause. \"Yeah. He wanted life to be better.\" </p> <p>What were his drinking patterns like? \"He'd go sometimes for two years if we were lucky, and be completely sober, and then fall right off the wagon again. In those days there wasn't as much help. With absolutely no self-pity, I think I sort of was the glue that held the family together.\" </p> <p>It was an upbringing that made her, if not intolerant of alcohol, then at least very aware of it, something which helped her withstand the pressures of early stardom. It also, I suspect, made her tough. When Andrews was 19, she won the lead role of Polly in a Broadway production of The Boyfriend and flew unchaperoned to New York. Emotionally, she says, she was much younger than her years. The contrast of Manhattan with Walton-on-Thames might easily have derailed her. But Andrews simply knuckled down and, true to the image that would later define her, got on with it. \"The work was hard, I was learning my craft and floundering to stay ... Let's see if I can put it correctly and succinctly,\" she says, sounding suddenly very Poppins-ish. \"A lot of my life happened in great, wonderful bursts of good fortune, and then I would race to be worthy of it.\" </p> <p>There must, surely, have been temptations along the way. \"Well,\" she says, \"I can't drink too much without getting absolutely silly. And drugs have, mercifully, never worked, so I think I'm far more frightened of being out of control.\" What drugs did she try? \"I didn't! Really, I didn't! I don't know why.\" She giggles. </p> <p>After The Boyfriend, Andrews had another successful run in the stage production of My Fair Lady, but it was Mary Poppins, for which she won an Oscar, that made her name. A year later in 1965, she starred in The Sound of Music and her fortune was sealed. Since then, of course, the film has had a life of its own. I ask why she thinks she is a gay icon. </p> <p>\"I don't know. I'm sort of aware that I am. But I'm that odd mixture of, on the one hand, being a gay icon and, on the other hand, having grandmas and parents being grateful I'm around to be a babysitter for their kids. And I've never been able to figure out what makes a gay icon, because there are many different kinds. I don't think I have the image that say, Judy Garland has, or Bette Davis.\" </p> <p>I suggest that these women encouraged their camp status by taking sidelong looks at the world. \"I bet they weren't,\" says Andrews, as if the very suggestion of irony is insulting. \"But I don't know whether longevity has something to do with it. I honest to God don't know. It's very flattering, in a way.\" </p> <p>As well as Emma, Andrews has two daughters with her second husband Blake Edwards, director of the Pink Panther films. The couple adopted Amy and Joanna from Vietnam; they are now 29 and 30.\"We didn't even think about what we were laying on them at the time,\" she says. \"We only knew what we hoped to do for them. Anyway, they survived. But they are [ready to visit the far east] now and they want to do it and I've said that we'll go.\" </p> <p>Andrews' singing career is over, but the success of The Princess Diaries has revived her acting career, and she has other projects on the boil. With her daughter, Emma, she has written several books for children which are published as the Julie Andrews Collection, an imprint of HarperCollins. The collection will be available in Britain for the first time next year. And she is busy with her seven grandchildren who are scattered, for the most part, near her home in Los Angeles. </p> <p>There are two questions that remain unanswered. One: was Christopher Plummer, as is widely assumed, playing Captain von Trapp for laughs? </p> <p>\"I don't think so. We see quite a bit of each other, and\" - she whispers - \"I think he's quite pleased that he did the film.\" (He made a terrible fuss about it at the time). </p> <p>And Dick van Dyke: Did she notice during filming how terrible his accent was? </p> <p>\"Um. Yeah. And he did too. He's darling about it. Absolutely sweet. And he says, 'Ugh, I'm so terrible, but I tried.' It is what it is and one wouldn't change it for anything. Fond memories.\" </p> <p>Does she think Mary Poppins and Bert ever got it together? Andrews gives a filthy laugh. \"I hope so. She wouldn't admit it, but I do hope so.\"</p>",
  "<p>Stuart Elliott scored an injury-time equaliser to keep Northern Ireland's slender hopes of securing a play-off place alive last night, just as it seemed that they would be left with an insurmountable task to qualify from Group Six. </p> <p>Lawrie Sanchez's side lifted themselves off the bottom of Group Six to maintain a slight chance of securing World Cup qualification. David Healy's stunning 25-yard volley levelled for the first time before Colin Murdock briefly headed Northern Ireland in front. </p> <p>Sanchez's side were given the perfect confidence-booster before their trip to Old Trafford when the substitute and Hull City striker Elliott turned in from close range after James Quinn had sent Keith Gillespie's left-wing cross back into the six-yard box. Christian Mayrleb had restored Austria to level terms before Markus Schopp claimed his second, but Northern Ireland hit back in the fourth minute of injury-time. </p> <p>Northern Ireland did at least have the Preston North End forward Healy back to boost their confidence after he had served a one-match ban for being sent off for his goal celebration against Wales last month. The Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll was also back in the starting line-up for the first time since August in place of Birmingham City's Maik Taylor. </p> <p>Carroll hardly got the start he and his team-mates would have wanted and was picking the ball out of his own net on 14 minutes. Austria unlocked the Irish defence with some incisive passing when Mayrleb sent Ivica Vastic free to cross low into the area for their captain, the Brescia striker Schopp, to convert. </p> <p>However, Northern Ireland had begun promisingly. Murdock headed straight at the Austria keeper Alex Manninger from six yards on five minutes and Healy curled a 25-yard free-kick just wide of the post two minutes later. Healy, however, eventually found the target and hauled Northern Ireland back when, after latching on to Jeff Whitley's flick, he struck a sublime first-time volley which sailed over the former Arsenal goalkeeper. </p> <p>Northern Ireland began the second half as they had the first, putting their visitors on the back foot, and the pressure paid of on 60 minutes when Murdock headed in Damien Johnson's corner to put the hosts ahead. </p> <p>A minute later and Austria were level after Mayrleb squeezed a shot past Carroll. Worse was to come as Murdock failed to clear a 72nd- minute cross, allowing Mayrleb to set up Schopp, whose emphatic finish briefly restored Austria's control.</p>",
  "<p>There are footballers who respond to a foul night in the way that other men bask in the sun. As the winter wind scoured the pitch and the mercury cowered in the thermometer, it was victory as usual for England but not in the customary manner. Sven-Goran Eriksson's team, protecting Michael Owen's goal, could only be as neat as unpredictable conditions and frozen feet permitted. </p> <p>This, particularly in a second half where Azerbaijan pushed gamely downfield, put the emphasis on men who would detest football if it ever became a summer sport. Nicky Butt, for instance, was instrumental in ensuring that Carlos Alberto's side scarcely had a chance in the game. Azeri moves cracked like thin ice. </p> <p>With a second win on foreign soil to follow the defeat of Poland, England have developed their control of Group Six by moving on to 10 points. In addition to having talents denied to the other contenders, Eriksson has a broader squad. They could play in a variety of ways and were well equipped to tough it out in Baku. </p> <p>If the margin was slender, this was a much firmer display than those given when, say, England scrambled to 2-1 wins over Slovakia and Macedonia en route to Euro 2004. Jermaine Jenas fitted in as if he had been designed for the responsibilities on the right of the minimalist three-man midfield. </p> <p>This, however, was not only his first start with England but also his debut in international competition. For 71 minutes, he showed athleticism and was prudent on the ball. It seems likely that Jenas found it easier to embrace a downbeat night such as this than the suspended David Beckham would have done. </p> <p>With Frank Lampard as intent as ever on imposing himself, Eriksson's trust in a reduced midfield was vindicated even though Azerbaijan had believed they could put a numerical advantage in that area to good use. If the Swede felt a twinge of disappointment it will have arisen from the shortage of chances despite the abundance of forwards. </p> <p>The Tofik Bakhramov Stadium may well get a plaque as the place where the normally brazen Wayne Rooney first appeared subdued. There would be no difficulty in picking out an incident here or there that highlighted his technique, but there was hardly any exuberance. </p> <p>Just before the interval, a pass back to the goalkeeper saw Azerbaijan concede a free-kick to the left of the goalmouth. On this occasion Rooney could do no more than slam it into a pack of players. When he did hit a 30-yard shot from another set piece, with nine minutes remaining, Jahangir Hasanzade dived to push it away comfortably. </p> <p>These were not failings by Rooney, merely instances of ordinary experience in an already spectacular career. It will be healthy for the Manchester United signing to encounter them and useful, too, for England to realise that they will not always be treated as Rooney's retinue. </p> <p>Owen, of course, can claim the evening as his own. It is premature to declare that he has come back to his best, but his worth was not to be questioned here or against Wales last Saturday. That should be considered a starting point for a man who now goes back to prove himself in Madrid. </p> <p>In the 22nd minute, England moved the ball well from Gary Neville on the right to his fellow full-back Ashley Cole on the other flank. The cross was deep and put Owen at an advantage as he rose to meet it with a header which found the net after clipping the body of Hasanzade. </p> <p>Earlier the goalkeeper had leapt to his right to push wide an attempt by Lampard which had deflected off Owen. It was like a parody of the incident that ended, after long and sober consideration, with the Chelsea midfielder being credited with the opening goal against Wales. </p> <p>Owen, though, was to give everyone something else to focus on. With Rooney staying fairly deep and Jermain Defoe, after a sprightly start, dropping from sight, there was a reminder that the Real Madrid man is England's senior striker. He now has 28 goals from 65 international appearances. </p> <p>Azerbaijan, by contrast, posed little threat at all even if Anatoly Ponomaryov had an appealingly old-fashioned 70s aspect as a long-haired mid fielder who likes to go on rangy runs. He did not get far enough with them, usually checked before he could slice open the back four. </p> <p>Rio Ferdinand attended well to any stirrings by the mediocre forwards and Paul Robinson had only one significant contribution to make. The goalkeeper was decisive, blocking with his feet, when Samir Aliyev challenged for a loose ball at a 51st-minute free-kick. </p> <p>England took a second consecutive clean sheet, doing so with little difficulty, even if Sol Campbell was far from his best. He has served Eriksson so well that the sort of lapse here that led to a booking for Nicky Butt will not be held against him. </p> <p>All the same, Campbell himself realises that, with John Terry and Ledley King around, he will have to be at his best to retain his status in the years ahead. If that makes him pensive, Eriksson can reflect contentedly that England may be bound for a higher level in world football.</p>",
  "<p>On a strange night in Cardiff, one that began with Mark Hughes quoting Bobby Kennedy about the dreams we harbour, Wales finished by experiencing the football equivalent of a nightmare. </p> <p>For 72 minutes the last match of Hughes's five-year spell in charge of Wales had the appearance of a bright new beginning for his country's football. Wales had been one up for 17 minutes and had dominated the game with a performance that was the opposite of their display against England at Old Trafford. </p> <p>A Wales victory, which would have been their first in competitive games since March of last year, looked far from a dream. Robert Earnshaw had given them a 55th-minute lead with a beautifully taken poacher's goal and he and Craig Bellamy had led from the front with a relentless show of running. </p> <p>Poland had offered little except stout defence, but Earnshaw's effort provoked them into attack and their response was devastating. </p> <p>In the space of 13 minutes Poland scored three times and stood the match on its head. They were three true goals and Wales are all but out of the World Cup. Hughes's successor cannot even dream of getting them to Germany. John Hartson did nab a second in injury-time, but such was the home team's pain by then that it was not even a consolation. </p> <p>\"It's a difficult defeat to take because for a long period we were in the ascendancy,\" said a downbeat Hughes afterwards. \"Once we scored I thought we'd be able to see the game out, but the goal meant they started playing. Before that I thought they'd just come to kill the game, spoil it. But then they scored three great goals.\" </p> <p>Of his five years in charge he said: \"At times you don't get what you deserve; football's hard. Sometimes we have just come up short, but the depth in Welsh football will always be a factor. People have to be realistic.\" </p> <p>Hughes mentioned having to use square pegs in round holes and last night was a case in point, Ryan Giggs crying off with a virus. That let in the right-footed Jason Koumas on the left of midfield. </p> <p>Hughes had also made a big decision in dropping Hartson to the bench. But with Earnshaw and Bellamy harrying from the start, Wales had early momentum. Where they had been lacklustre at Old Trafford, now they were vivid. </p> <p>Despite not winning a corner against England, Wales had one here in seven minutes. Many more were to follow as they flowed forward. </p> <p>Earnshaw had the first chance a minute later, and Gary Speed and Mark Delaney both went close before Bel lamy forced Jerzy Dudek into his first serious action, the goalkeeper tipping Bellamy's 31st-minute shot on to a post. </p> <p>Simon Davies was the next to test Dudek, with a 25-yard volley, and though half-time came and went without a breakthrough, and Wales's energy levels were somewhat depleted, all their activity paid off 10 minutes after the interval. </p> <p>Robbie Savage initiated the goal, taking a quick free-kick after Bellamy had been upended. Tomasz Rzasa got a toe to Savage's pass but Earnshaw persevered, took control and beat Dudek with the outside of his right foot. </p> <p>The stadium erupted but the feeling was that they needed another. How right that was. When James Collins lost the substitute Tomasz Frankowski, Paul Jones was anxious. Frankowski took one touch before firing his shot past the helpless goalkeeper. </p> <p>Winded, Wales staggered. Nine minutes later Maciej Zurawski pulled away from Delaney and, as he entered the area, planted a cleanly struck shot high past Jones. </p> <p>The situation was suddenly miserable for Wales. It got worse when Jacek Krzynowek cut in on his left foot and walloped a third past Jones. </p> <p>Hartson's header after that was irrelevant. Wales have two points, no manager and no hope of reaching the World Cup. </p>",
  "<p>In acquiring the services of David Collier, a qualified glider pilot who counts Donald Trump among his acquaintances and once held the post of senior vice-president at American Airlines, the England and Wales Cricket Board can claim that its new chief executive is a genuine high flyer. </p> <p>It is in the distinctly unglamorous world of English and Welsh cricket, however, that Collier wants to be judged. The 49-year-old formally accepted the post yesterday morning at Lord's and promptly set out an agenda which promises quiet reform of the game's domestic structures, gives priority to the England team and youth cricket and contains little that will startle the shire horses. </p> <p>The closest he came to a controversial measure as he outlined plans for a strategic review of the entire game was the suggestion that the payments that sustain the 18 first-class counties could in future be performance-related. </p> <p>The counties' reliance on such hand-outs has long offended many in the wider administration of British sport, not least because there is little to stop them spending the money as they wish, regardless of the impact on the game at other levels. Collier, who yesterday emphasised the importance of a successful England team and a thriving youth game, appears ready to address that. </p> <p>\"Performance-related payments have been discussed and there will be a section of the funding that will be tied to delivering certain targets,\" he said. \"I think that is good for the counties as much as it is good for us. We have to define to the counties the key elements they have to deliver, but it will be [about] how many England players they deliver, how strong their academy system is, with rewards for those that deliver success, and their youth set-up and links with grass roots locally.\" </p> <p>Collier, a keen cricketer himself who has represented the MCC and clubs in Essex and Shropshire, said the counties had a sustainable future but stressed they would have to prove their worth off the field as well as on it. He made plain that the England team needed to be winning for cricket to grow, and in order to be doing so on a regular basis young players needed to be attracted. In both these areas, he said, the counties, minor and major, had a role. </p> <p>\"They are a fantastic marketing arm for the game, but it is absolutely critical that through all 38 county centres young people can get to a centre of excellence. That's the only way in which we can deliver quality raw material to Duncan Fletcher and the England team to work with.\" </p> <p>Collier's CV is eyecatching for a British sports administrator, primarily because of his decision in 1986 to leave the game and seek business experience in the United States. </p> <p>After a spell at the computer company Sema he moved to a division of American Airlines, where he was at one stage in charge of ticketing for 40% of US air traffic. It was at this stage that he attended a leading business school, where Trump and the former General Electric chief executive Jack Welch were passing through. </p> <p>These are impressive names to drop on a wet Wednesday at Lord's, and prompted the question of why Collier left the US for a return to English cricket. \"I have a passion for the game; it's the game I love and I always intended to spend 10 years away. That's what I did,\" he said. </p> <p>Collier's marketing background was apparent in his pledge to deliver \"delight\" to the ECB's main sponsors, his assertion that \"the customer is king\" and in his \"can-do\" attitude. He is also intent on pushing for a more streamlined structure at the ECB, an organisation dominated by committees and in which the unwieldy 17-member management board of which he was a member holds ultimate decision-making power. </p> <p>\"I believe we can further simplify the structure of the ECB,\" he said, \"and it is important that we do that to convince the government and other stakeholders that cricket is modernised, effective and in a position to take the game forward.\" </p> <p>On the subject of Zimbabwe, he backed the board's decision to go ahead with five one-day internationals in November and December and said he had faith in the ability of the acting chief executive, Hugh Morris, to handle the tour. </p> <p>He also said he was relaxed about the prospect of having to restore England's reputation within the International Cricket Council. \"I used to negotiate new air routes and I met prime ministers and government officials in the process,\" he said. \"I am not daunted.\"</p>"
