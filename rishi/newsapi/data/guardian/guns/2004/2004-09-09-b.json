  "As usual, the \"liberal\" response to the bestial murders in Beslan is to seek to excuse them.

  "<p>Lying on a patch of rocky earth, in Chiba, just north of Tokyo, is a large machine about the size of a dinner table; it could be a small tank if it wasn't for the six legs aligned, insect-like along two sides of its rectangular body. Slowly, the machine rises up onto its feet and walks forward like a giant, silver beetle. </p> <p>This is not a creature from the latest Godzilla movie but a robot being developed by a group at Chiba University. If all goes according to plan, their test ground could soon be exchanged for the deserts of Afghanistan and Comet III could be working to help solve one of the country's biggest problems. </p> <p>Afghanistan is plagued by land mines. There are estimated to be up to 10m scattered across the country, mainly laid by Soviet forces and their allies between 1979 and 1992. According to an Oxfam report, they kill 150-300 people each month. </p> <p>Currently, mine-clearing is a dangerous business. It's also slow. Typically, workers crawl along the ground, probing it repeatedly as they inch forward. One person can check no more than about 50 square metres a day. </p> <p>There have been some novel attempts to take humans out of the equation, including a plant that changes colour when it detects a mine's chemicals in the soil. Many believe that nothing can beat a physical investigation; it's just that things would be safer if humans were not involved. </p> <p>Enter the robots. Japan leads the world in the production of robots, with more than half of all the world's industrialised robots as well as advanced entertainment robots such as Sony's Aibo dog and Honda's humanoid, Asimo. </p> <p>The team at Chiba University is led by Kenzo Nonami. \"There are almost 70 countries in the world with a land mine problem,\" he says. There are estimated to be more than 100m land mines strewn across the world. In most cases, the exact location of the mines is unknown. As a result about 800 people per month are killed and 1,000 more maimed due to accidentally triggering a hidden mine. In addition the minefields cause economic damage, hampering construction and tourism. </p> <p>Nonami's solution is an intelligent robot with excellent vision, and a dual propulsion system; caterpillar tracks for fast movement and six insect legs for more delicate manoeuvres in the minefield. Comet III will roll up to a minefield, raise itself up onto its six legs and then carefully walk around, searching for mines using stereo vision, metal detectors and a ground piercing radar system. </p> <p>The robot's stereo vision is particularly impressive: using that alone it is able to walk to any given point without outside control, recognizing the three-dimensional shapes of obstacles and plotting an appropriate route. </p> <p>At the moment, the robot takes more than 20 seconds to calculate each step, making it a very slow walker. \"We keep asking the manufacturers to make faster processor chips,\" says Nonami. The current pace of chip design is so fast that, within a few years processors will be sufficient to enable the robot to make very fast, almost human speed decisions when walking. Nevertheless, the robot already manages to cover 1,800 square metres an hour. </p> <p>The robot's systems need a lot of power and Comet III uses a 900cc petrol engine, which seems a little 20th century for such a futuristic robot. \"We would really like to power it from a fuel cell or solar power\" admits Nonami. Unfortunately, neither of these power sources can provide the amount of energy that the robot needs. \"We have even thought about a system like animals where the robot powers itself by consuming organic matter and converting it into energy\" he says. Such a robot would use muscle-like actuators, which would contract and expand, much like animal muscles. Such a system is, however, even further in the future than solar or fuel cells. At the moment, Comet III has cost about 100m yen (\u00a3530,000). If the design proves successful, and orders come in from around the world for 100 or more of the machines then the cost of each unit will drop to around the same as an average family car. The model that is likely to be produced when that day comes is not Comet III. </p> <p>The research group is already working on two new robots. The first is a collaboration with Fuji Heavy Industries, a caterpillar-tracked robot that is due to go to Afghanistan next summer. Employing many of the same technologies as Comet III but housed in a more robust vehicle and lacking Comet III's walking ability, it will be a proving ground for much of the group's technology. It will use a highly advance robotic arm to detect and uncover mines. The arm includes a small, jackhammer-like device to break open the soil (which in Afghanistan can be baked rock-hard), a pressurised air hose to remove loose soil and debris and a precision robotic hand which can pick up larger debris such as rocks, thus uncovering suspect mines. </p> <p>Next will come Comet IV: similar in design to Comet III but with much longer legs enabling it to take steps of over a metre in height. If all goes according to plan, and next year's trials in Afghanistan are successful, Comet IV or its successors could soon be crossing minefields all over the world.</p>",
  "The South African government is denying thousands of Zimbabwean refugees their right to political asylum, says a report published today by Refugees International. <p>\"Genuine refugees are prevented from getting asylum,\" said Andrea Lari, a researcher for the organisation. \"In many cases, Zimbabweans cannot even get into the appropriate office to apply for asylum. These people are being denied their rights.\" </p> <p>Mr Lari said up to 50,000 Zimbabweans were eligible for asylum. \"Of the 5,000 applications filed by Zimbabweans to date, fewer than 20 have actually received political asylum in South Africa,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Even more troubling is the fact that few Zimbabweans are able even to apply for political asylum.\" </p> <p>More than 2 million Zimbabweans are currently sheltering in South Africa - about 15% of their country's population of 13 million. </p> <p>Although Zimbabweans have sought work in South Africa for decades, the numbers have swollen greatly in recent years since the economic collapse presided over by President Robert Mugabe. </p> <p>Most of those in South Africa are economic migrants, without claims to refugee status. But thousands have fled because they are victims of state violence and torture and they fear more persecution. </p> <p>South Africa is obliged by law to grant political asylum to those who have a reasonable fear of such violence. </p> <p>But Refugees International says South African officials are preventing Zimbabweans from gaining their rightful status. </p> <p>Several Zimbabwean refugees told the Guardian that they were often chased away from refugee reception centres by guards with whips. \"The guards say, 'We don't want to see you Zimbabweans here. Go away!' They whip us and beat us until we run away,\" said one man, who said he had been tortured in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>Refugees International is also critical of the office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) for \"failing to advocate for Zimbabweans' right to protection\". It adds: \"UNHCR staff in South Africa downplay the political crisis in Zimbabwe and show a marked tendency to dismiss the legitimacy of Zimbabweans' overall case for asylum, making a minimal effort to provide direct protection.\" </p> <p>A regional UNHCR official said: \"We know there is work to be done to make sure all Zimbabweans can access the refugee procedure. That is true for people of other nationalities seeking asylum here, too.\" </p> <p>A senior South African immigration official admitted there were problems in the way the government dealt with the flood of Zimbabwean refugees. But steps were being taken to improve the situation. \"We agreed with the UNHCR to catch up with the backlog of cases of Zimbabweans seeking asylum,\" said Barry Gilder, director general of South Africa's department of home affairs. </p> <p>\"We are taking steps to counter corruption, and we have just agreed to set up new refugee reception centres, including one in Musina, near the border with Zimbabwe.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Do we overstate the importance of blogging or is it crossing into the mainstream?</strong> It's becoming more mainstream and an addition to the media conversation. There are too many blogs for anyone to follow them all, but I think any medium that encourages people to become participants as opposed to consumers is a good thing. </p> <p><strong> With traditional media increasingly owned by fewer people, how do we ensure the net stays as free as possible?</strong> That's going to take citizens being more active and insisting to political people, and to the corpora tions that control much of the technology, that openness is a precondition. It's something they must have. </p> <p><strong> Do you enjoy the instant feedback that the net affords? </strong> That's part of what makes this all so interesting.

This is \"remixing\". People are remixing the book like crazy and that's fun to watch. </p> <p><strong> Does blogging allow you to amend things more easily? </strong> One advantage of online media is that if you make a mistake, you can correct it quickly before there's damage and that's important. One has to own up to mistakes, though. </p> <p><strong> Is the online community unforgiving? </strong> I think unforgiving is not the right word, as it's actually quite a forgiving community provided you acknowledge your errors and fix them. That tends to enhance people's credibility. </p> <p><strong> Do you see Creative Commons making more of an inroad? </strong> I hope so. It's a shame the Creative Commons (<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org\">http://creativecommons.org</a>) organisation needs to exist, because the fact that it does is proof that copyright laws are a mess. I'm very glad they are around, as being able to publish under that license is a useful thing, for the publisher and for whoever wants to use the book in a different way.

  "<p>When it was suggested in advance of last night's match that England might like to let Poland score first, Sven-Goran Eriksson smiled and said, \"I don't think so.\" But, when his players scored in the first half and then allowed their opponents to equalise soon after the interval, the ghosts of past humiliations suddenly rose up. This time, however, England proved equal to the task of restoring their lead and then of hanging on for what felt, in the end, like a relatively comfortable victory. </p> <p>Four points from their first two qualifying matches for the 2006 World Cup represents a satisfactory return on the excursion to Vienna and Chorzow. Only in the 10 minutes between Maciej Zurawski's equaliser and the own-goal that put England back in control did Eriksson's men look in any danger. But some of the lessons of last Saturday night's disreputable draw appeared to have been absorbed and they finished the match with an air of composure and authority.</p> <p>The way Jermain Defoe took his goal after 35 minutes confirmed the consistent impression that he is ready and able to score at any level and against any opposition. Controlling David Beckham's short pass with characteristic neatness, swivelling away from his marker and hitting a precise shot from 12 yards out, he gave Eriksson a glimpse of a better future.</p> <p>He may also have tested Michael Owen's unselfishness to the limit. Eriksson's decision to opt for an Owen-Defoe partnership last night raised the doubt that they might simply duplicate each other's efforts. And, given Owen's current lack of form, last night's match looked like an audition for the single place available when Wayne Rooney returns to the squad, perhaps in time for the matches against Wales and Azerbaijan next month.</p> <p>If so, Defoe stated his case with conviction. Covering an enormous amount of ground, always available for a pass from midfield, a constant pest to his burly markers, the 21-year-old Tottenham striker showed the zest and speed that Owen, still only 24 himself, mislaid some time ago.</p> <p>Eriksson's decision to drop two of his players from Saturday's starting line-up indicated a willingness to accept the evidence of his own eyes. Omitting Alan Smith will have given the manager few qualms. Manchester United's new striker showed his strength and eagerness in Vienna but precious little subtlety. Defoe looked neater and brighter in his short time on the pitch and hit the post from an opportunity created by Owen.</p> <p>In that respect Defoe's first-half strike last night vindicated Eriksson's judgment and there were signs that he and Owen might form some sort of partnership, if hardly an ideal one. There was certainly enough evidence to make Sir Alex Ferguson ask himself why, after admiring Defoe for so long, he opted to take Smith to Old Trafford instead.</p> <p>The second change to Saturday's starting line-up may have given Eriksson a few more sleepless hours. Barely an hour after the draw against Austria he had stated: \"David James will play on Wednesday.\" No hesitation, no equivocation. But when the team trotted out on to the pitch at the Slaski Stadium, Paul Robinson was wearing the goalkeeper's jersey and James was taking his place on the bench.</p> <p>Clearly the manager's assurance on Saturday had been an instinctive expression of moral support for a player who, he knew, was about to receive a hammering in the next morning's papers. Eriksson wanted to say nothing that would add fuel to the bonfire. At some time within the succeeding four days, however, he made a decision that may spell the end of the 34-year-old James's international career.</p> <p>Robinson started last night's match reasonably well, given a first serious touch of the ball by Sebastian Mila's weak toe-poke from 20 yards after four minutes. With his defence working hard to smother Poland's quick counter-attacks, he had little to do for the next 20 minutes. Then Kamil Kosowski's left-wing cross swung over his head and he could only watch as Grzegorz Rasiak drove Ashley Cole's weak clearance back into the goalmouth for John Terry to block.</p> <p>In first-half stoppage time the goalkeeper needed two bites to gather a high ball under pressure from Mila but there was nothing he could do about Zurawski's equaliser. That apart, he was given a relatively easy night. What Eriksson would really like, however, is to see Chris Kirkland fit and in form in the Liverpool goal.</p> <p>As for the captain, at least he kept his nose clean. Beckham held his position on the right side of midfield throughout the match, thus helping to maintain the team's shape, and controlled his temper when England lost the lead. Otherwise his passing and crossing lacked accuracy and he contributed only in a passive sense to a team performance good enough to have eased, if not erased, some of the recent concerns about the immediate future.</p> <p>But last night's best news was that the arrival of Defoe, together with the confirmation of Ledley King's arrival as a senior international, the presence of the exciting Shaun Wright-Phillips on the bench, and the prospect of Rooney's return, takes Eriksson beyond a total dependency on the Beckham generation.

Some 259 shareholders signed a petition to prompt the meeting and will demand to know why Everton's financial decline has continued in recent seasons. </p> <p>The Merseyside club are some \u00a340m in debt, albeit with much of that securitised, and the manager David Moyes was given scant transfer funds to spend in the summer, leaving Everton with the smallest squad in the Premiership. The shareholders are similarly intent on discovering the board's plans for a new stadium now that a proposed move to the King's Dock has collapsed, and to question why the club still does not boast a youth academy. </p> <p>Those present are unlikely to discover the background to Wayne Rooney's controversial sale to Manchester United - the shareholders are permitted to ask only questions submitted on the original petition, which was completed before the teenager's departure. However, they are unlikely to be appeased by confirmation that Kenwright is to recruit Keith Wyness, formerly with Aberdeen, as his new chief executive. </p> <p>Queens Park Rangers' manager Ian Holloway yesterday welcomed the arrival of the former World Cup winner Dunga to Loftus Road and vowed to prove to the Brazilian, who is heading a consortium seeking to secure a 29.9% stake in the club, that he is the man to take QPR forward. </p> <p>\"If I have got to move heaven and earth to prove to these people that I am the geezer to do it, then I will,\" said Holloway. \"The regime at the minute is the right way for this to go and I'm not scared of that. If that means personal sacrifice and I'm not here any more, providing it means that the club moves forward, Ian Holloway gives that his blessing. But I'm telling you that I'm not going without a fight and my players know that.\" </p> <p>The former Brazil captain is one of four investors from the Monaco based company Barnaby Holdings, who have already purchased 10% of the club's shares and are seeking to increase that stake by a further 19.9% before the end of September. </p> <p>\"I can offer knowledge of football but I have no intention of being here on a daily basis or trying to be a manager,\" said Dunga.</p>",
  "<p>Tim Henman shrugged off an early setback to reach the semi-finals of the US Open for the first time, completing a 6-1 7-5 5-7 6-2 defeat of Dominik Hrbaty. </p> <p> The British fifth seed came tantalisingly close to victory on Wednesday night, cruising to a two-set lead when rain returned to halt his smooth progress. </p> <p>Henman held serve at 4-5 in the third when play resumed on Thursday but two games later a netted approach shot gave Hrbaty the set and a glimmer of hope. However the 30-year-old Henman, who had never gone beyond the fourth round at Flushing Meadows before this year, quickly regained control, breaking the Slovakian twice to set up a meeting with Roger Federer on Saturday at 5pm.</p>",
  "<p>Following on from the news that Pro Evolution Soccer will be enabled for Xbox Live play comes the announcement of the <a href=\"http://www.fifainteractiveworldcup.com/en/home.php\">FIFA Interactive World Cup</a>.

The winning player will be presented with their trophy by FIFA president Sepp Blatter at the same time as the Player of the Year award is dished out. Yes, get very good at FIFA 2005 and you could be standing on stage with Henry/Ronaldhino/Beattie or whoever wins.

  "<p>Kim Howells moves back to the department where he was briefly a junior minister between 1997 and 1998 - although then it was the Department of Education and Employment, a title the former research officer for the south Wales miners probably found more congenial. </p> <p>Mr Howells has been minister of state at the Department of Transport since last year and before that minister for tourism and broadcasting (2001 to 2003) and junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry (1998 to 2001). He has always been noted for his tendency to speak out in colourful language - most recently on the evils of rap music and the dreadfulness of modern Turner prize art or \"conceptual bullshit\", as he put it. He labelled the rappers So Solid Crew \"idiots glorifying gun culture and violence\".</p> <p>In contrast to his predecessor, Alan Johnson, who did not go to university, the blunt spoken Welshman is not only a graduate, but a postgraduate and a lecturer, although both men come from similar working class backgrounds and shared an early taste for radical left wing politics. </p> <p>Born in Pontypridd, he was educated at Mountain Ash grammar school and went to Hornsey College of Art, where a 1960s sit-in that caught the headlines was organised in his flat. Mr Howells later commented: \"I was very keen on storming buildings; really saw myself as a Red Guard when I went in and told the principal he had to leave his office.\" He gave up painting as \"bourgeois individualism\", although he has started it again as a hobby after 20 years. </p> <p>This is not the sort of record that will endear him to vice-chancellors (although some of them were doing undignified things in the 1960s too). It may not endear him to the National Union of Students either - they know that with his boss, the education secretary, Charles Clarke, a youthful dose of student politics has only inoculated him and left him capable of pushing through an unpopular policy like top-up fees.</p> <p>Now 57, Mr Howells worked briefly as a steelworker and a miner and was a research officer for the south Wales miners from 1982 to 1989 during the torrid years of the catastrophic National Union of Mineworkers strike. Loyal to the union, although he opposed Arthur Scargill's tactics, he even defended two strikers who killed a taxi driver taking a working miner. He broke with Mr Scargill - Mr Howells' conclusion from the strike was \"its failure changed everything and taught a lot of people there's no bloody shortcut to political power and no future outside parliamentary politics\" - and became one of Neil Kinnock's inner circle after being elected for Pontypridd. He had, in the meantime, acquired a PhD from Warwick University.</p> <p>The former rugby player still loves mountaineering - although he remains among the foothills of the Labour government in a post that has lost much of its high profile since the passing of the higher education bill and the introduction of variable tuition fees. Implementing the new policies will attract a good deal less attention than squeezing the measure through the Commons with knife-edge majorities, as Mr Johnson had to do.</p> <p>Mr Howells is married (second) with two sons and a stepdaughter.</p>",
  "The lengthy referendum campaign for the EU constitution began in earnest today, as the government published a white paper setting out the case for approving the new treaty. <p>With a referendum likely to be at least a year away, the prime minister has written the foreword to the document insisting that this is \"clearly not a treaty which reduces our powers as a nation\".</p> <p>The no campaign has already got under way, backed by both the Conservatives and the UK Independence party (Ukip), with polls suggesting that the government has a mountain to climb before a yes vote can be guaranteed.</p> <p>Mr Blair hailed the controversial treaty as good for both Britain and Europe, and said he had \"no hesitation\" in recommending acceptance in the poll, expected after the next general election. </p> <p>\"I have no hesitation in commending it to the country as a success and as a major step forward in creating the kind of Europe that the British people want: a flexible Europe in which Britain remains a strong and influential power; a wider, peaceful and free Europe to which we can be proud to belong; and an effective Europe which benefits all our lives,\" he wrote. </p> <p>Publication of the white paper came ahead of a set-piece debate in the House of Commons later today in which the Conservatives will restate their opposition to the constitution. </p> <p>Mr Blair said that the enlargement of Europe to include 10 new members from eastern Europe and the Mediterranean earlier this year made it a \"sensible moment\" to redraft the complicated set of treaties and agreements governing the union's operations as a single, understandable and up-to-date document.</p> <p>He added: \"The treaty ... makes it plain that the EU is not and will not be a federal superstate. Rather, it establishes clearly where the EU can and cannot act and confirms that the EU is a union of nation states, which has only the powers given to it by these states.\" </p> <p>Suggestions that the constitution would mean Britain losing its seat on the UN security council, forfeiting control of its oil or its army or being forced to join the euro were \"myths\", said the PM.</p> <p>Britain would retain its veto on \"the most important decisions\", including issues of tax, social security, foreign and defence policy and the UK's annual rebate, as well as its opt-out on measures affecting asylum and immigration. </p> <p>In today's white paper, Mr Straw wrote that Britain had achieved \"all its key negotiating objectives\" in the inter-governmental conference which produced the treaty text. Meanwhile the Conservatives yesterday launched a new offensive against the treaty, saying they were determined to secure a majority No vote in the referendum. </p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, today said: \"I had hoped that with this white paper, we would see the start of an honest and open debate, instead this document is simply an extended piece of New Labour spin, full of claims that do not stack up. </p> <p>\"Tony Blair won't even admit that he used to be against an EU constitution in the first place. The fact is that the constitution will take huge powers away from Britain and give them to Brussels. It forms the basis of a federal European state. </p> <p>\"If we want to keep our own employment laws, our own asylum policy, and our own criminal justice system, we should throw this constitution out.\" </p> <p>Echoing the Ukip position, he said the treaty was \"a gateway to a country called Europe\". Yesterday, at a Westminster press conference, he added that his party might challenge its publication with the Electoral Commission, which has drawn up rules on how the referendum campaign should be fought, if it believed those guidelines had been breached. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Vote No campaign said: \"Straw is losing his grip on reality if he thinks that people will vote yes to this constitution. </p> <p>\"Of the last 32 opinion polls done on the constitution, only one has shown people in favour - and that was carried out by the European commission. </p> <p>\"A majority of voters are against the constitution in every region, every age group, every social group and among the supporters of every political party.\"</p>",
  "<p>Unwilling to countenance queuing or stopping at red lights, Italians are an improbably patient lot when it comes to getting their national sport up and running. Here we are, deep in September and still they've yet to kick a ball in anger. However, the A-Teams are finally ready to get it on this coming weekend, and you don't have to be BA Baracus to know that means some top action in store. </p> <p>First up: who's favourite for the title? Let's see now; Milan set a new points record last season, winning the scudetto by 11 points from second-placed Roma, and 23 from neighbours Inter. Milan have kept all of last years' starters and added smilin' Jaap Stam to their squad, which means their back line now reads Cafu, Stam, Alessandro Nesta and Paolo Maldini, and their front line remains Andriy Shevchenko, Kak\u00e0 and Jon-Dahl Tomasson (or Filippo Inzaghi or Hernan Crespo). Ouch. With Andrea Pirlo, Clarence Seedorf and Rino Gattuso cavorting around betwixt the two, it really is hard to see Silvio Berlusconi's outfit getting beat much this season.</p> <p>That said, Juventus are looking like a million dollars compared to last time around. This summer the formerly tight old lady stunned us all by reaching under her skirt and producing a large pot of spending money with which to greet new manager Fabio Capello. </p> <p>Capello, who just last year declared \"I'll never join Juve\", has so far won league titles at every single club he's managed. Thanks to Juve's three big signings, he's in with a good shot this time too: Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro has joined at centre-back, Brazil's midfield general Emerson in, yes, the midfield, and Sweden's scoring demon Zlatan Ibrahimovic up front. Question marks still surround both the backline and - stop me if you've think you've heard this one before - the form of Alex Del Piero, but all in all the Turin giants look set to walk tall once more. Keep an eye too on their 19-year-old Uruguayan wingman Olivera. </p> <p>Inter have had, for them, a quiet summer, signing just nine new players. They've also brought in another new manager, Roberto Mancini. After his success at Lazio, it's tempting to believe the dashing young Roberto will be the one to finally lift Inter's curse, and certainly their side looks impressive, with a forward line led by Adriano, one of the best goalscorers in the world, and featuring Christian Vieri, Alvaro Recoba and Obafemi Martins.</p> <p>Their midfield is much improved too - Edgar Davids adding some backbone alongside the enigmatic Juan Sebastian Veron, with Ze Maria and Dejan Stankovic taking the flanks. However, like Juve, Inter have some potential headaches. In the midfield, Chelsea reject Juan Sebastien Veron has a comeback potential only slightly better than that of vinyl long-players, and you have to wonder too at the wisdom of selling Cannavaro to Juve. Not only have Inter strengthened a title rival, they've also left their backline in the hands of Marco Materazzi, pushing goalie Francesco Toldo a step closer to that nervous breakdown he's been working on. </p> <p>Still, Inter should be top three and, with Mancini in charge, they could yet finally reach the title. The same can't be said for Roma, who played Serie A's best football for long stretches of last season, but who have lost Emerson, Jonathan Zebina, Walter Samuel and of course their manager, Capello. To make matters worse, Capello's replacement, Cesare Prandelli, then bailed out just two weeks before the start of the season for family reasons. </p> <p>Curiously, Roma chose to replace Prandelli with Rudi Voeller, who is admittedly a former Roma star, but who's also coming off a dismal run with Germany and has no experience at all of managing in Italy. Frankly, it'll be a minor miracle if 'Auntie' Voeller can control Roma as, on field and off, Francesco Totti, Antonio Cassano and Co are a difficult bunch to manage - even the famously square-jawed Capello struggled here at times. Moreover, Voeller's Roma face the opening rounds in Italy and Europe without their first-choice centre-backs. Since one of their early games is a trip to the Bernabeu, well, draw your own conclusions.</p> <p>Beyond the top four there's all sorts happening, with a warm welcome back to Serie A for Fiorentina, Sicilian derbies, Paolo Di Canio and Gianfranco Zola. Zola, 38, is in for a particularly rough ride, as his Cagliari team is one of the worst in the division. Di Canio, meanwhile, has jacked Charlton to ride to the rescue of his beloved Lazio, joining at a time when the capital side may finally have touched bottom (a favourite Roman pastime). </p> <p>Thanks to the club's new owner, Lazio have halted their slide to bankruptcy, losing in the process most of the first team (Stefano Fiore, Bernardo Corradi, Stam, Claudio Lopez, Demetrio Albertini, Sinisa Mihajlovic and manager Mancini) but hanging on to enough players to put mid-table respectability within their reach. Glamorous, no?</p> <p>Fiorentina have altogether bigger plans, returning just two seasons after disappearing to the fourth division (they skipped a division coming back). Along with Palermo, another promoted side, the formerly bankrupt Fiorentina have emerged this summer as one of Italy's biggest-spending clubs and have assembled a squad that boasts Hidetoshi Nakata, Fabrizio Miccoli, Enzo Maresca, Tomas Ujfalusi, and Real Madrid's baby star, Javier Portillo. Their challenge for a Uefa spot looks assured. </p> <p>Palermo's would do too, were it not for their president Maurizio Zamparini, a man who waited till his team were top of the division to fire his last manager, Silvio Baldini, and who's already barely speaking to the current incumbent, Francesco Guidolin. Baldini incidentally is now helming Parma, another team with a chance at a Uefa place having held on to star striker Alberto Gilardino, and the backbone of last year's team. Meanwhile, fans of urban unrest will be heartened to know that with Messina are back up too, meaning Sicilian derbies with Palermo. And judging by previous meetings in Serie B, these two matches won't easily be forgotten. </p> <p>So that's how they line up. The weekend begins Saturday with Chievo v Inter, while Roma v Fiorentina and Sampdoria v Lazio are the big games on Sunday, the latter live on British Eurosport. See you next week for news of the opening salvos.</p>",
  "<p>Anti-smoking campaigners today denounced plans by the pub industry to ban smoking at the bar in more than a third of UK pubs and bars as \"utterly inadequate\". </p> <p>The pressure group Ash (Action on Smoking and Health) claimed the move by five of the UK's leading pub companies was merely an attempt to stave off legislation to ban smoking in the workplace.</p> <p>The pub chains Enterprise Inns, Mitchells &amp; Butlers, Punch Pub Company, Scottish &amp; Newcastle Pub Enterprises and the Spirit Group, which together run around 22,000 outlets, today pledged to ban smoking at the bar by the end of next year and make 80% of pub space non-smoking within five years. </p> <p>But Deborah Arnott, the director of Ash, said: \"This is a last desperate throw of the dice by the biggest players in the pub trade. </p> <p>\"They spin their plans as a smoke-free initiative, but they are nothing of the kind. They will still leave their non-smoking customers gasping. They will fail to protect pub workers from the grim toll of death and disease caused by breathing in other people's smoke. </p> <p>\"Finally, this proposal would leave more than half the country's pubs unaffected. This utterly inadequate proposal won't provide even the flimsiest fig leaf to cover the government's shame if it now ducks the challenge of ending smoking in the workplace.\" </p> <p>The five pub chains' new smoking policy also states a minimum of 50% of restaurant or dining areas within pubs should be non-smoking by December 2005 and that they will develop smoke-free venues where \"appropriate and practical\". </p> <p>Rob Hayward, the chief executive of the British Beer &amp; Pub Association, which announced the policy, said: \"Pubs want to provide staff and customers with great work and social environments. </p> <p>\"Clearly, with the number of non-smokers on the increase, companies want to reflect that in the way they run their pubs. We want to see better choice for non-smokers. </p> <p>\"At the same time we believe in freedom of choice and a policy that will still allow smokers to enjoy a night out with their friends in the pub.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> There has been a huge drop in cigarette sales in Ireland since the introduction of the workplace smoking ban, it emerged today. </p> <p> Smokers in the Republic are expected to buy 500 million fewer cigarettes this year if the decline continues in the wake of a ban in pubs and clubs, new figures showed today. The state's tobacco market shrank by 7.5% in the first six months of the year, according to the country's largest cigarette manufacturer, Gallaher. </p> <p> If the trend of declining sales continues, tax returns from tobacco will fall by 81 million euros this year (\u00a355m). The department of finance had only forecast a drop in tobacco tax income of around 70 million euros (\u00a346m).</p>",
  "It is a familiar tale of the inability of arts management to stick to a budget. The National Theatre, under artistic director Nicholas Hytner, was granted a deficit of \u00a3500,000 for the past financial year. The National responded by playing to packed houses and general acclaim. As a result, it extravagantly declared a profit of nearly \u00a350,000 for the year. It is balance sheets such as this that threaten to give arts administrators a good name. <p>The bald truth is, as Mr Hytner noted in the National's annual review: \"Subsidy works.\" In the case of the National, it generated \u00a323m in income, and received \u00a314m in arts council grants. The subsidy allowed it the financial freedom to innovate and attract record box office sales. Part of this was the result of a string of hits, ranging from the irreverence of Jerry Springer - The Opera to the high drama of Michael Frayn's Democracy. But the other half of the equation was a decision to offer 150,000 tickets, sponsored by Travelex, at just \u00a310 each. That spurred a rush of new visitors to the National, many of whom liked the experience so much that they came back for more and were willing to pay full price. </p> <p>The National's success with \u00a310 tickets reinforces a basic law of economics. As budget airlines found, passengers will fly to remote destinations if the price is right, so theatre-goers will fill the stalls. Yet theatres must reassure their audience that quality has not been discounted along with the ticket price, or risk suffering the fate of the Savoy Opera earlier this year. Unlike the Savoy - cheap in too many ways - the National kept its quality high, while producing exciting new works, such as Owen McCafferty's brilliant portrait of modern Belfast, Scenes From the Big Picture, or Kwame Kwei-Armah's Elmina's Kitchen. </p> <p>There is a lesson here for arts administrators everywhere. In Dublin, where Mr Hytner's counterpart has just survived a vote of no-confidence, the Abbey is in crisis and laying off 30 staff. In the West End, a series of big productions have recently flopped. The Hytner principle, of making theatre attractive in every sense, is the script to follow.</p>",
  "<p>Headteachers today called for the creation of a new breed of \"in-house\" examiners to cut the cost of the annual exam bill, which has spiraled to \u00a3380m a year.</p> <p>Under plans by the Secondary Heads Association, published in a report today, the most experienced teachers would be trained to become chartered examiners so they could mark their own pupils' work, rather than rely on external examiners. </p> <p>According to the report, schools and colleges spend \u00a3380m a year on entering their pupils for GCSEs, AS and A-levels and vocational courses. Part of that money goes towards paying for examiners who are teachers in other schools. Every year millions of papers are sent between schools, but under the SHA plan more would be marked within the school they were sat. </p> <p>The association said an initial pilot in history and chemistry AS-levels could begin as soon as 2005. </p> <p>The president of the SHA and headteacher of Chesham high school in Buckinghamshire, Tim Andrew, said: \"The present examinations and testing regime in schools is out of control. </p> <p>\"The government should put more faith in the professional judgment of teachers by using in-course assessment as a major component of external examination grades. The SHA proposals for chartered examiners represent a realistic and practical way forward.\" The general secretary of SHA, John Dunford, added: \"Most importantly, these proposals offer the best way to reduce the massive load of examinations for young people... \u00a3380m per year is damning evidence of the bloated examinations system.\"</p> <p>The plan is for all regions of England and Wales to take up the scheme, with examiners accredited by the National Assessment Agency in England, which is part of the exams watchdog, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority.</p>",
  "MPs will vote on a bill to ban foxhunting next Wednesday, with all stages of the bill to be debated and voted on in a single day, the leader of the House of Commons revealed today. <p>Peter Hain said an extension of Commons hours would be required to accommodate the debate.</p> <p>Despite a free vote on the issue on all sides, Labour's huge majority and anti-hunting backbench sentiment make it all but certain the bill will be passed, before moving to the Lords for consideration.</p> <p>If, as seems equally likely, peers reject the move as they have done before, the government will then invoke the Parliament Act to force the legislation through.</p> <p>Confirming that the bill will allow a two-year delay to disband hunts, Mr Hain said opponents of a ban would thus have an intervening general election in which to register their views. The Conservatives have pledged to revoke any ban, although Michael Howard's MPs will also have a free vote on Wednesday.</p> <p>Mr Hain said: \"This is an inhumane sport, but it is important that we deal with it in a humane way. The RSPCA have offered to help in the relearning of dogs.\"</p> <p>He dismissed threat of civil disobedience from the Countryside Alliance, saying: \"Threats of action will be totally unjustified. Pro-hunters will be free to vote accordingly at the election.\"</p> <p>However, the bill will outlaw hare coursing within three months of enactment. </p> <p>For the Tories, Oliver Heald accused Mr Hain of pressing the \"nuclear option\" in going for the Parliament Act, and complained that the government had failed to address the issues of compensation and the legal breadth of the proposed offence.</p> <p>The Commons has repeatedly backed a ban by large majorities since Labour came to office in 1997 but efforts to resolve the controversial issue had foundered in the Lords. </p> <p>Mr Heald appealed to ministers to think again about rushing the bill through the Commons in just one day and possibly using the Parliament Act. </p> <p>But Mr Hain said the will of parliament must be upheld and insisted one extended Parliamentary day would be sufficient for MPs to settle an issue they had debated \"time and time again\". </p> <p>He defended the proposed delay in implementing the ban, insisting this would allow those involved in hunting to \"refocus\" on other activities like drag-hunting. </p> <p>This morning one of the logistical objections to banning foxhunting was rejected by the police, when the chief constable of Suffolk said that the cost of preventing hunting would be the same as the current expenditure on policing hunt saboteurs.</p> <p>Alastair McWhirter, who speaks on hunting issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said he expected the cost of dealing with illegal hunts if the bill is passed to be no more than is currently spent on policing legal meets. </p> <p>Mr McWhirter told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"We spend a lot of resources at the present time policing what is currently legal. </p> <p>\"If this becomes illegal, I suspect we will spend about the same resources on policing any civil disobedience that will follow. </p> <p>\"I don't think it will be any more of a problem than it is now. It will just be different and we will develop tactics in dealing with it effectively and well.\" </p> <p>Asked what he expected the scale of flouting of a ban to be, he responded: \"It depends on what is in the law. When the law is passed we will see how it is going to work in practice. </p> <p>\"It also depends on the people who are prepared to get involved in civil disobedience. We will have to wait and see.\" </p> <p>But hunting's supporters point to Scotland, where a bill attempting to ban hunting has proved largely ineffective. </p> <p>The Countryside Alliance said it was a \"vicious, prejudiced attack on families across the country.\"</p> <p>Chief executive Simon Hart said it would \"signal an outright assault on everyone who believes in freedom and tolerance\". </p> <p>\"The alliance, its members and supporters, having always acted in good faith, are furious that the government has abandoned its promise to resolve this matter on 'evidence and principle' in an act of political vandalism. </p> <p>But the move - seven years after Labour came to power promising to outlaw the sport - was welcomed by animal rights' campaigners. </p> <p>Douglas Batchelor, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the hunting bill is coming back to the House of Commons. </p> <p>\"This heralds the high point of our 80-year campaign to expose foxhunting as a cruel sport and to get it banned.\"</p> <p>But he added: \"There is absolutely no reason why there should be a two-year delay, because it is going to be a free vote on both the hunting bill and the amendment to extend the deadline. </p> <p>\"We are confident that, given a free vote, MPs will stick to their guns, vote with their consciences and stick to the original timetable. </p> <p>\"As far as we are concerned, three months is more than adequate for every hunt in England and Wales to convert to drag-hunting. There is no need for a single job to be lost or a single dog to be put down.\"</p>",
  "<p>After last season's incredible Super Bowl, in which Adam Vinatieri kicked a field goal to hand New England victory over Carolina with four seconds to go, and Justin Timberlake revealed a little more than expected of Janet Jackson, American football has a lot to live up to this year.</p> <p>The summer has been agonisingly long, but full of intriguing trades and player cuts as clubs search to build the ideal 53-man roster. </p> <p>The salary cap ensures gridiron remains one of the more unpredictable sports, and with NFL officials demanding a strict crackdown on illegal defensive play, the new season, which kicks off tonight when the Patriots tackle Indianapolis, promises to be another to remember.</p> <p>Here we detail the chances of all 32 clubs as they begin their quest to be part of Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville next February.</p> <p><strong>AFC East</strong> (last season's record in brackets)</p> <p>New England Patriots (14-2) <br> Miami Dolphins (10-6) <br> Buffalo Bills (6-10) <br> New York Jets (6-10) <br></p> <p>New England start the campaign where they ended the last one: as the best team in American football. Having won two of the last three Super Bowls - and all of their last 15 matches - they remain the team to beat. Placing their priority on the team rather than any individual should continue to pay dividends, though they pay $17m of their permitted $79m outlay on quarterback Tom Brady and cornerback Ty Law.</p> <p>The Dolphins are still reeling from Ricky Williams' incredible decision to retire at the age of 27. They will struggle to replace his phenomenal rushing, and could also be without key linebacker Zack Thomas, who has a knee injury. The Jets have looked good in pre-season games, but expect this to be misleading, while the Bills will settle for mediocrity once more.</p> <p>Predicted division winner - New England</p> <p><strong>AFC North</strong></p> <p>Baltimore Ravens (10-6) <br> Cincinatti Bengals (8-8) <br> Pittsburgh Steelers (6-10) <br> Cleveland Browns (5-11) <br></p> <p>The story of the summer has been the return of \"Neon\" Deion Sanders, who is back after retiring three years ago to become a broadcaster. The remarkable decision is to the benefit of Baltimore, who add the legendary cornerback to their star-studded squad. With Jonathan Ogden at offensive tackle and the inspirational Ray Lewis at linebacker, the Ravens' defense looks great. If Kyle Boller can deliver in his second year at quarterback, a big if, the Ravens could go all the way this year.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the pressure has been heaped on 2003 No1 draft pick Carson Palmer, who will start at quarterback for Cincinatti. The Steelers are a talented group, but need to show more cohesion than last year to challenge, while Cleveland do not have enough strength to make an impression - they could challenge San Diego for the worst record in the NFL.</p> <p>Prediction - Baltimore</p> <p><strong>AFC South</strong></p> <p>Indianapolis Colts (12-4) <br> Tennessee Titans (12-4) <br> Jacksonville Jaguars (5-11) <br> Houstan Texans (5-11) <br></p> <p>As Jaguars running back Fred Taylor said recently: \"The team that wins our division will be a heck of a team.\" The AFC South promises to be the most competitive division in the NFL, with all four teams staking a claim for the play-offs. The Colts have signed top quarterback Peyton Manning on a $98m contract but, having failed to improve their squad elsewhere, could fall short. Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair is vital to their chances, especially with the team losing several of their more experienced players.</p> <p>For Jacksonville and Houston, the question is whether this is one year too early for their blossoming lines. The Jaguars have some particularly talented youngsters, with ones to watch including linebacker Daryl Smith and wide receiver Reggie Williams. </p> <p>Prediction - Jacksonville</p> <p><strong>AFC West</strong></p> <p>Kansas City Chiefs (13-3) <br> Denver Broncos (10-6) <br> Oakland Raiders (4-12) <br> San Diego Chargers (4-12) <br></p> <p>With Oakland Raiders one of the poorer squads in the league, and the San Diego Chargers content to win just one game this season, the AFC West boils down to two teams: the Chiefs and the Broncos. For Denver, it's all about their linchpin Jake Plummer. The quarterback is critical to their success, as the statistics show: with him, they have won 11 out of 13 games, without him; they have lost four from five.</p> <p>Kansas, meanwhile, need to improve on their dire defense, which was ranked 29th last season. By bringing Gunther Cunningham back as defensive coordinator, they have made their most valuable off-season signing. With their unstoppable offense they should reach the play-offs, but we will know more after they meet the Broncos in the season opener this weekend.</p> <p>Prediction - Kansas City</p> <p><strong>NFC East</strong></p> <p>Philadelphia Eagles (12-4) <br> Dallas Cowboys (10-6) <br> Washington Redskins (5-11) <br> New York Giants (4-12) <br></p> <p>After defeats in the last three NFC Championship games, Philadelphia are convinced this season will finally be theirs. They have acquired controversial wide receiver Terrell Owens from San Francisco after his refusal to join Baltimore. They have also added defensive end Jevon Kearse, whose last two seasons have ended prematurely because of injury. If those two shine, the Eagles will top the division.</p> <p>The Giants hope Eli Manning, brother of Peyton and this year's No1 draft pick, can live up to his billing, though first he has to battle his way past Kurt Warner to even make the perennially underachieving team. Washington are a good outside bet, especially if running back Clinton Portis can repeat his form of last year, while the Cowboys are probably past their best, highlighted by their 40-year-old quarterback Vinny Testaverde.</p> <p>Prediction - Philadelphia</p> <p> <strong>NFC North</strong></p> <p>Green Bay Packers (10-6) <br> Minnesota Vikings (9-7) <br> Chicago Bears (7-9) <br> Detroit Tigers (5-11) <br></p> <p>The NFC North promises to be one of the weaker divisions. Detroit are offensively sound, with Joey Harrington spraying the ball from quarterback to his young receivers to good effect; but they have lost 24 in a row on the road. The Bears are, at best, in transition this season. Minnesota manager Mike Tice, meanwhile, is in the last-chance saloon as he enters the final year of his contract. He is extremely confident, as he always is, and with the signing of Antoine Winfield to bolster the Vikings' tackling, he may have reason to be.</p> <p>Denmark's Morten Anderson, another Vikings' acquisition, should expect to break Gary Anderson's all-time field goal record at the age of 45. Minnesota are dark horses, but the Packers remain the team to beat, with Brett Favre and other familiar faces returning for another year.</p> <p>Prediction - Minnesota</p> <p> <strong>NFC South</strong></p> <p>Carolina Panthers (11-5) (20/1) <br> New Orleans Saints (8-8) (33/1) <br> Tampa Bay Bucaneers (7-9) (20/1) <br> Atlanta Falcons (5-11) (25/1) <br></p> <p>If only Carolina had an offense. That was the view of many experts following their run to Super Bowl defeat last time out. Sadly, nothing has changed. The Panthers again look imperious defensively, but the offensive line has not improved. Jack Delhomme has secured a big new contract at quarterback, but with little support, he faces a hard time to prove he is not a one-season wonder.</p> <p>The Panthers will come under threat from both Tampa Bay and New Orleans. The Bucaneers, bankrolled by Manchester United stakeholder Malcolm Glazer, have achieved a huge overhaul in playing staff over the summer, and only time will tell if the trades are to the benefit or detriment of the franchise. The Saints have certainly added to their squad well, and look well-placed with Aaron Brooks at quarterback. Atlanta are likely to make up the numbers.</p> <p>Prediction - Carolina</p> <p> <strong>NFC West</strong></p> <p>St Louis Rams (12-4) <br> Seattle Seahawks (10-6) <br> San Francisco 49ers (7-9) <br> Arizona Cardinals (4-12) <br></p> <p>The AFC West will be another division contested by just two teams. With Arizona's record-breaking rookie of last year out injured until mid-October, and San Francisco losing almost all their leading lights, St Louis and Seattle are in a private dual to make the play-offs. The attacking Rams outfit will hope to benefit more than any other team from the new rules on defensive play - Steven Jackson has looked particularly impressive in rushing for most yards of any running back in pre-season.</p> <p>They will miss offensive tackle Kyle Turvey, ruled out for the season, and the Seahawks could take advantage of holes in their squad. Seattle's problem last year was their dismal away record, and they will need to heed the lesson quickly as their first two matches are in New Orleans and Tampa Bay.</p> <p>Prediction - Seattle</p>",
  "Welcome to the Northerner, Guardian Unlimited's weekly digest of the best of the northern press. <p>______________________________________</p> <p>What a pleasant change, after all the northern headlines about the British National Party over the last few years: the Bolton Evening News is awash with celebrations of that sporting town's latest sporting hero, the Olympic boxer Amir Khan. Story after story follows his progress from Halliwell boxing gym at the age of eight to glory in Athens; and as several letter-writers to the paper point out, he's done more for local community relations than years of government policy.</p> <p>His father Shajaad, who runs one of those car-dismantling yards fill of teetering old wrecks, is almost as much of a cult figure, with his Union Jack waistcoat and excellent practice of praising Britain, and especially Bolton, at every available opportunity. He disappoints many in the town this week, though, with his latest revelation about Amir. The 17-year-old has got a steady girlfriend.</p> <p>This has \"broken hearts all over Bolton,\" says the Evening News, which makes full use of the internet to offer picture portfolios and a huge archive of Khanery on its online site. The boxer's sweetheart is the daughter of family friends in Rawlpindi, Pakistan, but if things get serious, she's likely to find herself moving to Lancashire to continue the boxing/car-scrapping dynasty.</p> <p>Amir, meanwhile, has an older fan in thrall: Prentice Howarth, the first woman to be mayor of Bolton for 20 years. She broke through his guard at a civic reception with what the News calls \"a smart one to his cheek\" - a kiss rather than a smart right hook.</p> <p>______________________________________</p> <p>Liverpool's triumph in the European capital of culture competition for 2008 has led to all sorts of sparky initiatives, and there's another good one reported in both the Evening Echo and the Daily Post. The whole city is being encouraged to read the same book at the same time, next month, to get people talking about literature and similarly elevated issues.</p> <p>The lucky author is Louis Sachar from Texas whose British publisher Bloomsbury dreamed up this cunning way of promoting his book about young people in a US prison, Holes. Appropriately, the scheme was launched in Liverpool's most famous hole, the network of caves burrowed under Edgehill in the early 1800s by Joseph Williamson. He was a retired tobacco merchant who employed thousands on the project as a form of poor relief.</p> <p>The book, whose upbeat story of a teenager learning to like himself (through the unusual method of digging holes at the correctional camp in the US desert) has made it popular in schools, will be on sale throughout Liverpool for USD3.99 in October, three pounds less than its usual price. Libraries are also stocking up with extra copies and the city's romantics are preparing unusual chat-up lines for chance encounters on the ferry or buses: \"That bit in chapter eight - a tad postmodern, do you think? Or am I missing something? Here, let me show you the paragraph I mean...\"</p> <p>___________________ </p> <p>Let's hope the project produces some Liverpool versions of Sue Rann in years to come - a housewife who's the subject of another literary story this week having just produced her first novel. At the age of seven, she tells the Evening Chronicle up at Newcastle, she announced her intention of becoming an author after asking her dad how all the world's books came to be.</p> <p>\"He was a great reader of thrillers and the house was full of them,\" she says. \"When he explained to me about people who wrote these books I knew then that was what I wanted to do.\" And that's what she's now done, with an attention to detail which caught the Chronicle's attention.</p> <p>When she got to the last page of Looking for Mr Nobody, a thriller of her own set in Amsterdam, Sue thought she'd better pay a final visit to the Dutch city to check that she'd got everything right. With a friend who had enough air miles for a free day trip, she scoured every setting, going round and round the centre in ever-decreasing circles and employing all her five senses, especially smell.</p> <p>\"My book talked about the smell of diesel hanging over the station, but when I got there I found that all of the trains are electric,\" she says. \"So I changed that bit to the smell of wet clothes.\" Good to know what care goes into even a debut thriller; Liverpool readers please think on and discuss.</p> <p>______________________________________</p> <p>I found myself idly clicking on the adverts on northern websites this week - a resource which jobhunters are increasingly using. It's so much easier to roam around with the help of a keyboard, rather than trek down to the Jobcentre. And the whole businesses of copying, pasting and whanging CVs too and fro via email has made those Job Club sessions - free stationery and stamps - seem like something from the Stone Age.</p> <p>You can be disappointed, though. I went to the personal ads slot on the Northern Echo site called \"Achievements\" - presumably designed to celebrate successes in the north east. I got this: \"Achievements. Sorry. There are no matching entries in the database for today's date. Please check back tomorrow.\"</p> <p>Let's hope there are some to come; but I couldn't get help from the Echo's agony aunt \"Dear Debbie\", either. I clicked on her button to ask if Darlington needed a hand with achievement, and this came up: \"Dear Debbie. This website is now closed. However, we have left the counsellor's guidance online so that you can see her answers to various issues that may relate to your own concerns in life.\"</p> <p>Woe. What happened to Dear Debbie? Maybe there's a clue in one of those lonely gobbets left hanging on the cyberspace which used to be hers. She advises a correspondent who has been dumped to \"... continue as you are, moving through the grieving process but also keeping your options open as to your choices in the future. It could well be the beginning of a whole new chapter in your life.\"</p> <p>______________________________________</p> <p>The Runcorn and Widnes Weekly News, meanwhile, seems to be prospering in the small ads department. It has a section called \"Happy Adverts\" which, I'm pleased to say, has 136 entries this week. There's more happy news in the neighbourhood, too, in Cheshire Life magazine which reports that 400 harvest mice have been released into the county at \"a secret location in the wilds of the countryside.\"</p> <p>I'm not sure where the wilds of carefully manicured Cheshire are to be found, but that's just as well as the mice-releasers want them to be left alone in peace to get on with what mice are best known for doing. The aim of the project, says Cheshire Life, is to let the 400 rip in the breeding department, \"giving the endangered species a toehold back in Cheshire, where harvest mice used to thrive.\"</p> <p>As they snuggle up in the wilds, however, the little creatures will not be entirely alone. They were nurtured at an ecological consultancy in Knutsford where they were fitted with microchips and, in some cases, \"tiny radio collars so that students from Liverpool university can track their movements after release.\"</p> <p>______________________________________</p> <p>There's something a touch sinister about that, maybe, in the Orwellian Big Brother sense. And that applies up the road in Salford, too, where apparently lampposts are going to start giving warnings to passers-by. The Manchester Evening News describes how sensors will trigger \"a loud voice from a box on the lamppost which gives a security warning to drivers who have parked and are walking past.\"</p> <p>The devices, which may also be fitted to litter bins and bollards to add variety to Salford life, boom out a reminder to lock all doors and not leave possessions on show. They can also be programmed to deliver their messages at random times of day, and may shortly \"be moved around the city to give other messages to combat different types of crime.\" ______________________________________</p> <p>On the northern sporting front, Leeds is the place to be this Saturday, when the first-ever football coaching conference for women takes place at the south Leeds stadium. Provided you can find the place - it's hidden away down a network of baffling side roads - you'll discover the amazing growth of women's football, for all that it's still overshadowed by the likes of Becks and Wayne Rooney.</p> <p>Ten years ago, there were an estimated 10,000 regular women footballers and the only club anyone had heard of was the Doncaster Belles. Today there are over 100,000 and two years ago, the game officially became Britain's most popular women's sport.</p> <p>With David James in mind, you'll be glad to hear that the day's events include a session on goalkeeping. Big cheeses in attendance during the day include the Football Association's head of development. It's taking the TV companies an unaccountable amount of time, but they'll surely latch on to this side of the noble game soon.</p> <p>______________________________________</p> <p>Finally, please keep an eye out for Toby and Flash, graphically described in the Halifax Courier as \"two old dears with a combined age of 130 who have been abducted from a village.\"</p> <p>In spite of the inappropriate name \"Flash\", the dears are pet female spur-thighed Mediterranean tortoises from Greetland, where they lived for years in the garden of Jessie ad Gary Drinkwater.</p> <p>It's mean of someone to have nicked them in a night raid last week, especially as they aren't likely to be leading the sort of contented life they enjoyed in Calderdale. Gary, a 59-year-old stonemason, built them their own \"Swiss-style chalet home\" with heat lamps inside to keep the them at the 90F temperature they need.</p> <p>The Drinkwaters have also had Toby for 30 years, although they lived for most of that time under a crucial misapprehension which explains the unusual name for a lady tortoise. Jessie Drinkwater tells the Courier: \"We only discovered that Toby was a she when they joined the Manchester Tortoise Society and they took a good look at her.\"</p> <p>______________________________________</p> <p>For links to the northern press, visit http://www.theguardian.com/northerner.</p>",
  "Explosives, detonators, and a rifle have been found hidden in a cinema in Russia's second city of St Petersburg, the country's interior ministry said today. <p>The cinema had been closed for renovation when the explosives were found by police, Reuters cited the official Interfax news agency as saying.</p> <p>The find immediately prompted speculation that the cache of weapons may have been left in advance by militants planning another hostage-taking attack. However, the police operation was led by organised crime squad, meaning the weapons may have been linked to one of the city's mafia gangs.</p> <p>The discovery of the weapons appears to have been an intelligence-led, much needed success for Russia's beleaguered authorities, which have been criticised following last week's Beslan tragedy.</p> <p>Citing ministry sources, Interfax said that before the discovery, police had arrested three men from Kazakhstan and confiscated four assault rifles from them.</p> <p>The arms cache in the cinema included 900g (2lb) of plastic explosives, a 200g (8oz) stick of dynamite, two improvised explosive devices, a hunting rifle and 23 rounds of ammunition, Reuters said.</p> <p>The militants who seized control of a school in Beslan, North Ossetia last week and left more than 350 people dead had hidden explosives under the building's floor ahead of the attack. </p> <p>Entertainment venues in major Russian cities have been targeted before by Chechen militants. </p> <p>In October 2002, militants took some 700 people hostage at a theatre in Moscow and a siege ensued. It ended with the death of 128 hostages when troops stormed the building after pumping in an opiate-based \"sleeping gas\". Of the 33 hostage-takers, those who did not succumb the gas were killed by Russian troops. </p> <p>The discovery of weapons in St Petersburg will add to the current climate of fear in Russia, a country in shock after the horrors of Beslan, a recent suicide attack in Moscow and the apparent bombing by terrorists of two passenger planes.</p>",
  "<p>Hostels are to be opened to treat the country's most dangerous sex offenders, including paedophiles, in a bid to cut the chances of them reoffending, the government announced today.</p> <p>Five residential treatment centres will be set up across England and Wales, each housing up to 25 high-risk sex offenders. The clinics will provide treatment and specialist supervision to each offender for up to a year.</p> <p>The prisons minister, Paul Goggins, said that the Home Office was already trying to identify suitable sites for the hostels and pledged there would be full public consultation.</p> <p>The move was announced as research for the National Probation Service said that residential clinics could cut the number of child sex offenders reconvicted within two years from 30% to 10%.</p> <p>An evaluation of the Wolvercote Clinic in Epsom, the UK's only residential treatment centre for sex offenders which closed in 2002, showed that it was twice as effective at reducing reconviction rates than prison-based treatment programmes.</p> <p>The report, An Assessment of the Need for Residential Treatment Facilities for Child Sex Abusers, recommended setting up four or five new hostels to rehabilitate offenders and protect the public.</p> <p>But the proposals are certain to run into fierce public opposition. The Wolvercote clinic was forced to close after plans to relocate to the Silverlands hospital in Chertsey, Surrey, were shelved following protests from local residents.</p> <p>Mr Goggins said: \"As a government, and as a society, we have to face the fact that there are violent and sex offenders who will eventually have to be released into the community. </p> <p>\"We can never completely eliminate the risks posed by dangerous offenders, but we can do a huge amount to minimise them and protect our communities. </p> <p>\"Our work to identify suitable sites for residential centres to treat sex offenders is part of this public protection agenda, although we will clearly need to move forward very carefully in this process.\"</p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said the new hostels could be located in hospitals and were unlikely to be within prison grounds.</p> <p>There will be no powers to detain the offenders, who will be able to come and go from the premises - although their freedom may be partly restricted. Some will have just been released from prison and others will be on community sentences. </p> <p>Paul Cavadino, the chief executive of crime reduction charity Nacro, said: \"This is an important step forward in increasing public safety and improving the rehabilitation of offenders. </p> <p>\"Sex offenders will be more closely supervised, monitored and treated in these centres than in any other type of community provision. By cutting reoffending rates, the centres will reduce the number of children and adults who suffer the appalling trauma of sexual abuse. </p> <p>\"Anyone campaigning against opening such a centre must realise that they may be increasing danger to the public and the suffering of future victims.\"</p> <p>A new national sex offender strategy, also published today, proposed a range of other measures to reduce the risk posed by sex offenders in the community.</p> <p>These include satellite tracking and electronic tagging, six-monthly lie detector tests and installing software on paedophiles' computers to check whether they are accessing child abuse images.</p>",
  "<p>The most powerful hurricane to hit the Caribbean region in a decade has laid waste to the island of Grenada, it emerged today. </p> <p>Hurricane Ivan devastated Grenada after pummelling Barbados and other islands and its winds and rains have been blamed for at least 15 fatalities.</p> <p>Ivan is now on a direct course for Jamaica, Cuba and the hurricane-weary southern United States.</p> <p>The storm inflicted most of its damage on Grenada on Tuesday, but the havoc created by the 125mph winds, which cut communication lines, meant the extent of the destruction was not known until now. </p> <p>Some 90% of homes on the \"spice isle\" of Grenada, which has a population of 100,000, were damaged, and an unknown number of convicts were set free after a 17th-century stone prison was destroyed. </p> <p>A UN spokesman said virtually every major building in St George's, the capital, had suffered structural damage. </p> <p>The prime minister, Keith Mitchell, whose own home was flattened, was forced to relocate his office to a Royal Navy vessel. \"We are terribly devastated ... It is beyond imagination,\" he told his people from aboard the ship. </p> <p>Grenada's police commissioner, Roy Bedaau, told Voice of Barbados radio 12 people had died but provided no details.</p> <p>Mr Mitchell said it would be a \"surprise\" if the death toll did not rise. He also confirmed that the prison escapees included some of the 17 people who were jailed for life for killings carried out during the 1983 Marxist coup, which sparked a US invasion. </p> <p>Medical students from the US, fearful of marauders, armed themselves with knives and sticks, the Associated Press reported. </p> <p>Nicole Organ, a 21-year-old veterinary student from Toronto, said after venturing out after the hurricane passed she saw bands of men carrying machetes looting a hardware store. Sonya Lazarevic, 36, from New York, said: \"We don't feel safe.\"</p> <p>Commissioner Bedaau said every Grenadian police station had been damaged, hindering efforts to control looting. Police were trying to set up a temporary post at St George's fish market and Trinidad and other Caribbean countries were sending troops. </p> <p>The United Nations is sending a disaster team but the long-term effects of the hurricane are likely to spell economic disaster for Grenada. Much of the country's agriculture, including the prime nutmeg crop, was destroyed. </p> <p>Hurricane Ivan has already struck Venezuela, Tobago, Barbados and St Vincent, damaging hundreds of homes. </p> <p>A 32-year-old pregnant woman died in Tobago when a 12-metre palm tree fell into her home. In Venezuela, a 32-year-old man died after battering waves engulfed a kiosk on the northern coast. </p> <p>A 75-year-old Canadian woman was found drowned in a canal swollen by flood waters in Barbados. Neighbours said the woman, who had lived in Barbados for 30 years, had braved the storm to search for her cat. </p> <p>Ivan is expected to reach Jamaica by Friday and Cuba by the weekend and then the US, the US National Hurricane Centre in Miami said. Meteorologist Jennifer Pralgo said: \"We're hoping it's not Florida again, but it's taking a fairly similar track to [Hurricane] Charley at the moment.\" </p> <p>Hurricane Charley killed 27 people in south-west Florida last month and there have been estimates that it caused almost \u00a34bn worth of insurance damage.</p>",

So if there is a small increase this year then you have to see this against a background of a 50% fall over the last 30 years,\" says Colin Blakemore, chief executive of the Medical Research Council. </p> <p>To add to the confusion, the statistics show the total number of procedures - any single task from taking blood to injecting it with drugs - carried out on the animals. So, even if the number of animals used goes down, the number of procedures may go up. There were around 20% more procedures on primates in 2003 than in 2002; however, the number of individual primates used for the first time in 2003 dropped by 24%. </p> <p>Another confusion in the numbers is the increasing use of GM animals. Breeding a GM mouse counts as one procedure, irrespective of whether an experiment is actually carried out on it. Simon Festing of the Association for Medical Research Charities says that two-thirds of GM animals produced have no experiments carried out on them but they account for several hundred thousand procedures. </p> <p>And scientists are using more GM animals than ever. To understand the results of the human genome project we need animals such as mice, a species which shares 90% of its genes with us. \"One of the things you can do is add a human gene to a mouse so that the mouse gets a disease it otherwise would not have got, like cystic fibrosis,\" says Festing. \"Then you can observe the mouse and try out new therapies on it.\" </p> <p>But animal rights campaigners argue that scientists are not doing enough to find alternatives. This year, the government announced plans for a new centre that will co-ordinate the development of alternatives with a budget of just over \u00a3660,000. </p> <p>\"Given the relative pittance they're actually giving this centre, it's hard to believe they've got a genuine commitment to replacement,\" says Penny Hawkins, senior scientific officer at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. </p> <p>Festing disagrees: \"That figure is money to be spent in co-ordinating research. You cannot set up a central office and expect to find alternatives. All alternatives are essentially discovered in research centres where the research is going on.\"</p>",
  "The Liberal Democrats today unveiled ideas aimed at taking the \"cliff-edge\" out of retirement, with a raft of policies for Britain's booming generation of retirees. <p>Charles Kennedy called the 27-point \"Third Age\" briefing paper an example of the party \"thinking ahead of the other parties\" as 11 million baby boomers move into retirement over the next decade.</p> <p>Echoing the prime minister's speech last week where he called retirement \"an opportunity not a threat\", the party proposes a \"flexible decade\" as people come to the end of the working lives.</p> <p>The party says a third of people between 50 and 65 are currently out of work, mostly not through their own choice, and costing the economy \u00a316bn a year - a situation described as \"madness\" by policy coordinator Nick Clegg, the former MEP who is standing to be an MP in Sheffield at the next election.</p> <p>He said: \"Without urgent action, we are at risk of squandering the skills, energy and experience of that whole generation. Our proposals are designed to ensure we value and nurture the contribution of those approaching the end of their working lives. </p> <p>\"Consigning millions of individuals to the scrapheap of involuntary retirement is madness.</p> <p>\"Maximising retirement income, using digital TV technology in the home, helping to acquire basic IT skills, challenging deep-seated ageist attitudes and promoting regular exercise are also part of our comprehensive set of policy proposals.\"</p> <p>The party proposes allowing pensioners to continue some form of part-time working while drawing a pensions, and the creation of a network of Third Age Advice centres.</p> <p>While forming a loose ethos rather than a concrete set of policy proposals, the document has already been welcomed by Help the Aged, Demos and the Third Age Employment Network.</p> <p>Mr Kennedy said: \"In the context of longer healthy living, a fixed retirement age for all can seem more arbitrary than ever before. Current government legislation does not actually prevent people from working beyond 60 or 65, but it does encourage a culture where retirement at that point or earlier is normal and expected. </p> <p>\"So we are proposing a flexible decade of retirement to help ease people from the world of work into their old age, with a particular emphasis on allowing people at the end of their careers to work part time while drawing on a part of their pension income.\"</p> <p>The key proposals include: <br><b>\u00b7</b> To strengthen and enforce age discrimination legislation and improve support for older jobseekers so no one is barred from the workplace by age. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To support the government in allowing people to withdraw some of their occupational pension while working for the same employer, so that they can reduce their hours but make up their earnings. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To support changes to the way in which company accounts reflect the hidden costs of early retirement packages, so discouraging unnecessary redundancies among older workers.<br><b>\u00b7</b> To make it financially possible for older people to access education, by opening up student loans to those aged over 55, provided they have assets against which to secure the loan. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To enforce age discrimination legislation in training, so that employers cannot focus all their training resources on younger employees. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To promote use of digital technologies as tools for learning in the third age. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To reward volunteers for their time through pension credits, time banks, food vouchers or travel passes as appropriate. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To encourage those organisations currently representing the interests of older people to coordinate information services about volunteering, possibly by emulating the membership organisations in the United States. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To explore potential for volunteers to provide non-essential assistance in police stations. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To give people in the third age one first point of contact for information and advice, called Third Age Advice Centres. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To bring independent financial advice services, and health services such as pharmacies or the community nurse, into the same buildings, possibly based around existing Post Offices. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To include public computers in the Third Age Advice Centres, with training courses on how to use them. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To use local and regional digital television services to give out information on local events and to give advice targeted on those in the third and fourth ages. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To encourage people to stay active as they get older through information campaigns, and to look at enabling doctors to prescribe certain forms of exercise. <br><b>\u00b7</b> To ensure that all carers have a full assessment of their particular needs, and to require Local Authorities to establish carers strategies to work with carers in providing new support.</p> <p>The director of Help the Aged, Paul Cann, welcomed the proposals. \"These ideas must move to the centre stage of the debate,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Older people are not a problem or a burden that can be parcelled off to different departmental compartments; they are a resource to be cherished.\"</p>",
  "<p>There is something birdlike about Ben Christophers, a little of the nervous Dickensian clerk, and something quite other that the word \"elfin\" only begins to express. He's both steely and fragile. Since 1999, he has made three albums that pick up the baton for a strand of eccentric, elegant English pop that leads from Roxy Music and Robert Wyatt to David Sylvian, the Cocteau Twins and Talk Talk, while also seeming utterly alien. Blessed with an extraordinary voice, he is often spuriously compared to Jeff Buckley, with whom he has little in common. The sound is hard to pin down: bewitchingly androgynous, it could be the voice of a child or someone immensely old. </p> <p>His first two records, My Beautiful Demon and the darker, more oblique Spoonface, were rapturously received. After the release of Spoonface, and before work began on his new album, The Spaces in Between, recorded mostly in his own tiny studio, Christophers was dropped by his label, V2. It was \"a bleak time\", he says - but it isn't until much later that he tells me the full story of that rejection and its effect. </p> <p>Christophers grew up just outside Wolverhampton, in the \"idyllic\" village of Albrighton, which \"felt like the biggest place in the world\". He says he always \"felt like an outcast. I wasn't terribly happy at school. I always felt I wanted to leave, to try something else.\" </p> <p>When he was five, his father gave him an acoustic guitar, which he claimed variously he'd \"nicked\" or \"got free with a washing machine from Rumbelows\". Christophers had started writing, and recording his songs on an old reel-to-reel tape machine donated by his uncle, at about the same time. \"He gave me all these reel-to-reel cassettes,\" he says. \"There's something fantastically therapeutic about putting a reel on the spool and leading the tape across and wrapping it round. Listening to the Beach Boys' harmonies, the way the voices moved and swirled around, it just killed me. In fact, I think I copied their songs and pretended they were my own.\" Eventually the machine fell apart. \"I remember it almost looking at me and saying, 'I can't do this any more.' I love that machine. I've still got it.\" </p> <p>At \"16 or 17\", Christophers went to Camden for a day and saw a band in a tiny venue. \"It was terrifying,\" he says. \"Real indie killer thrash death metal. I was so wet behind the ears. I remember standing there, face pale. I thought, I wanted to be part of a scene, but I've got a nice shirt and nice pair of trousers on.\" Still, he returned a few days later. \"I thought, I'll rip these trousers and I won't wear these shoes,\" he smiles. \"And I loved it.\" </p> <p>The usual stints in undistinguished bands and terrible jobs followed as Christophers tried to work out what he wanted to do. He had an \"unbelievably dark\" time working at a warehouse in the East End of London that distributed pornography. \"A lot of people who worked there were in trouble,\" he says, even now looking visibly disturbed. </p> <p>In the early 1990s, he became drawn to dance music, fascinated by the output of Sheffield's pioneering electronic label Warp. But, he grins, once he had \"learned all about drum machines, I literally put them aside, picked up my guitar and started writing songs. I knew there was a place for them with me.\" He also met David Kosten, then a fledgling producer who was making his own records as Faultline. (Kosten is something of a connoisseur of singers; he has subsequently worked with Chris Martin, Michael Stipe and Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips.) The pair quickly developed a working relationship so close that Christophers considers My Beautiful Demon more of a collaboration. \"David changed the way I made music. He put in depth and colours I never thought were possible. But it was also his coaxing, the way he'd speak with me, the way he could get a lyric across or explain why a melody worked. He completely turned my world upside down. I thought, 'I don't know anything!'\" </p> <p>Kosten, in turn, loved how Christophers \"created his own world. It was like nothing I'd ever heard: a combination of sophistication and childlike innocence. The songs sounded simple but the structures were amazing. It was very pure, uncorrupted. It felt like he existed outside any kind of music-industry world.\" </p> <p>\"I try to write thinking as a child would do,\" Christophers says. \"Maybe it's the child in me - because that's the most powerful way to look at something. You see it for what it really is. As a grown-up you don't see through things; you look straight at them.\" </p> <p>Although Kosten was around when Christophers began gathering songs for The Spaces in Between, he also had a record of his own to promote. \"Our paths weren't really crossing,\" Christophers recalls. \"I'm not precious about having to write everything or be in control of it all - but with this record I was. It was a good exercise; it was total regeneration. Everything changed so much, I'd been so unwell ... \" He pauses, unsure of how to continue. And, haltingly, the thing he's been skirting nervously around comes to light: at the end of 2002, exhausted and crushed, finding himself without a deal, he had a breakdown. </p> <p>\"After I left V2, to be honest with you, things were falling apart mentally. I'd been away so much touring and really working hard. I just broke down, it was just around the corner from here, actually.\" He gestures towards Cambridge Circus, at the edge of Soho. \"It was very strange, like going blind ... I'd become so disturbed and upset because everything around me was over, that I just ... I was bundled into a taxi by a passer-by and found myself in hospital. I was in and out. It got really bleak. I was starting to hallucinate. It's so difficult to explain, which is why I wasn't going to mention it: I don't know how to talk about it. After about six months, because I was trying to write, trying to get my head together - I learned a lot about tolerance towards myself - I got such cabin fever, and got so paranoid about it all.\" </p> <p>Gradually, he got better, finally capturing \"the whole feeling of moving on\" in the first of his new batch of songs that he was really happy about, Everybody Stood to See Us, a gorgeous, richly melodic surge of hard-won euphoria. It is the sound of \"joy, really. That's why I wanted the album to be upbeat.\" </p> <p>Are you, in general, happy? </p> <p>\"No,\" he shoots back immediately, laughing. \"That's a funny question. I think I'm happy in certain things at certain times. I'm not happy when I'm not working. I don't feel like I'm operating. My happiness is a strange mix between extremes rather than straight down the middle. It's a bit manic, I suppose.\" Then, as if taking his own temperature, unsure of minute-to-minute fluctuations, he says, \"Talking to you I feel happy. It feels nice. </p> <p>\"My trouble,\" he continues, disarmingly matter-of-fact, \"is that I'm incredibly sensitive. So vulnerable. And yet when something happens it can knock me sideways but it doesn't happen right away. It's like, you know you can get vitamin C ... ?\" </p> <p>Slow release? </p> <p>\"Yes. So, especially with all the stuff with the label, I just wanted to change everything, become happier. A new label, a new career. When you said to me, 'Are you happy?' - I so wanted to get better, to get away from all that. Getting the record done, I feel this enormous sense of relief ... it's like the line in Everybody Stood to See Us, 'All along we were OK.'\" He smiles. \"It just reminds me of what my mum used to say to me: 'You might worry now but you'll be all right.'\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Spaces In Between is out on Monday on Cooking Vinyl.

  "Jean-Marie Le Pen has suspended two senior members of the National Front, as he tries to resolve an acrimonious succession battle inside France's extreme right party. <p>The party purge came after dissident members of the movement organised a rival conference in the south of France last month, timed to coincide with the National Front's official summer gathering held in the north. </p> <p>Irritated at the direction Mr Le Pen is taking the party, and at the growing power of his youngest daughter, Marine Le Pen, the renegade members have publicly urged the 76-year-old leader to make way for a younger man. </p> <p>Jacques Bompard, the ultra rightwing mayor of Orange, led the rebellion, hosting the splinter conference in his town, a bastion of rightwing voters in the heart of Provence. </p> <p>Like other veteran party members, Mr Bompard believes that Mr Le Pen is being pulled into more mainstream positions by his daughter, whom he is grooming to take over the party's leadership. </p> <p>Mr Bompard, a dentist, organised the rival event in direct contravention of party orders and his faction was joined by a hardline Catholic wing of the party. Several senior members of the NF boycotted the official events and defected to the rival conference. </p> <p>During the weekend meeting, they launched repeated attacks on Marine Le Pen's authority, with delegates warning that to \"follow her path would be suicidal for the party\". </p> <p>Dissident party members dislike her relatively liberal positions on abortion and gay marriage and have criticised the degree to which Mr Le Pen is delegating responsibility to her. </p> <p>Despite her appeal to younger voters and her telegenic qualities, the relative political inexperience of the 35-year-old lawyer has been blamed by some for the party's poor results in elections earlier this year. The party has failed to repeat the extraordinary electoral success it won during the first round of the presidential elections in April 2002, when it took over 17% of the vote. </p> <p>Described by her mother as \"the clone\" and by her father as an \"ideal physical specimen\", Ms Le Pen, has attempted to promote herself as the acceptable face of the party and has helped tone down the party's anti-immigrant language, saying she wants to \"de-demonise\" the Front. </p> <p>Tensions over her position within the party hierarchy have been simmering for two years. One senior frontiste resigned in April 2003 when Mr Le Pen appointed Marine vice-president, giving her an automatic seat on the party's executive committee, even though she came in only 34th out of 137 candidates in an election for the central committee. </p> <p>Long-serving party activists saw the move as a challenge to the party's \"official dauphin\", Bruno Gollnisch. Mr Le Pen has yet to announce whether he will run for the presidency again in 2007, but talks semi-seriously of continuing until he is at least 95. </p> <p>After the Orange conference, Mr Bompard told journalists that the era of the Duce and the F\u00fchrer was over and the National Front no longer needed that kind of leadership. \"Raising the issue of succession is not a crime,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Le Pen disagreed. After a crisis meeting at his home on Friday, nine members of the executive committee decided in a unanimous vote to suspend Mr Bompard and Marie-France Stirbois, a regional councillor in the south of France, from their party functions. </p> <p>\"They participated in operations during the election campaign which were damaging to the National Front, they have made hostile remarks about the NF leadership and have contributed to the party's loss of influence,\" Mr Le Pen said. \"Asking politicians to pull in the same direction is the very least one should demand during election campaigns. These were serious breaches to the whole political movement which need to be punished.\" </p> <p>Marine Le Pen said their actions had put \"the party's future in danger and damaged its credibility in the eyes of its electors\" .</p> <p>This is the second major rupture within the party in the past six years. The former deputy leader Bruno M\u00e9gret left the party in 1998 to set up a new breakaway movement, after failing to edge out Mr Le Pen. His success has been minimal and many of his followers have returned to the National Front. </p> <p>The fate of the two suspended politicians will be resolved on September 16.</p>",
  "<p>The University of Oxford has applied to the high court for an injunction to protect its staff and students from attacks by animal-rights activists fighting plans to build a research laboratory there. </p> <p>The application would seek to limit protests at the site of the biomedical research building in the heart of the university's science area. </p> <p>Work on construction of the building has been halted since July when the main contractors pulled out after their shareholders received intimidating letters. </p> <p>Protesters have been holding regular pickets of the site of the \u00a318m facility, which is designed to combine all research on animals at the university into one building. </p> <p>The project has been beset by problems since February when a local campaign group, Speak, made it the focus of an intense animal-rights campaign. </p> <p>\"The university recognises that the vast majority of those opposed to the construction of our new biomedical research building act within the law to express their opposition to the use of animals in research,\" said a statement issued by the university yesterday. </p> <p>\"However, experience, particularly over recent months, has shown that there are those who are prepared to harass, threaten or attack people who are conducting ordinary legal activities. </p> <p>\"The targets of such activists have not only been those working in this area of research, but increasingly those who are only indirectly linked to them - such as suppliers of unrelated goods or services.\" </p> <p>The university says that its intention is not to prevent demonstrations or legitimate protest, but rather to \"create a climate in which there can be a reasoned debate by those on both sides of this argument\". </p> <p>The application includes provisions for protests to be held once a week in Oxford, while campaigners would retain the right to apply to the local police to hold additional demonstrations for larger numbers.</p>",
  "<p>Nearly half of Britons would help a terminally ill relative to commit suicide, a survey showed today. </p> <p>In a poll conducted by the Voluntary Euthanasia Society (VES), 47% of people said they would help a loved one die if they were suffering unbearably.

A further 11% said the law should not allow people to receive medical help to die, with the remainder undecided. </p> <p>The last time the VES asked the same question in a survey - before the death of campaigner Diane Pretty in 2002 - the figure in support was 81%. </p> <p>In today's poll, 51% said they would want help to die if they became terminally ill and were suffering unbearably, while 37% said they would not, and the remainder were undecided. </p> <p>The chief executive of VES, Deborah Annetts, said: \"NOP World's survey shows the public's support is unwavering and has actually increased since Diane Pretty died. </p> <p>\"By saying they would be prepared to break the law if a terminally ill loved one asked them to, the public are sending a clear message to our law-makers that the law needs reform.\" </p> <p>She added: \"The choice they have is between secret, unregulated assisted dying and a regulated system with the strictest safeguards in the world. It is plain that a one size fits all law that criminalises the compassionate as much as it does serial killers is unsustainable.\" </p> <p>Initial figures from the survey published last week showed that 50% of all Britons would consider going abroad to receive medical assistance to die if they were suffering from a terminal illness. </p> <p>VES has handed more than 80,000 messages of support to the House of Lords select committee which today begins examining Lord Joffe's assisted dying for the terminally ill bill.

  "<p>The genetic profiles held by police for criminal investigations are not sophisticated enough to prevent false identifications, according to the father of DNA fingerprinting. </p> <p>Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, a geneticist at Leicester University, said police DNA databases should hold more information to lessen the chances of a false positive. </p> <p>He was speaking at a briefing to mark the 20th anniversary of his pioneering of DNA fingerprinting. </p> <p>Genetic profiles stored by police normally record the details of 10 specific parts of the long chain of molecules that make up a person's DNA. The chances of two unrelated people having the same details for all these 10 markers - and hence the chance of a false identification - is said to be about one in a billion. This method has traditionally been regarded as highly efficient at identifying suspects from DNA traces left at crime scenes. </p> <p>However, Prof Jeffreys said the increasing number of records being held on the police database - currently about 2.5m - meant that having only 10 markers per person was no longer foolproof. </p> <p>He suggested 15 or 16 markers to reduce the chances of two people having the same profile to one in more than a trillion. American law-enforcement authorities are already considering changing the profiles in their DNA databases along these lines. </p> <p>In Britain, DNA evidence has been used in countless criminal investigations and the police regard it as an invaluable tool. Peter Gill, of the Forensic Science Service, which administers the national DNA database for the police, said his agency was \"confident that the 10 markers currently used are sufficient\". </p> <p>He said: \"The chance of an adventitious match is fairly small, yet we never discount the possibility, and all our reporting officers are aware of this. </p> <p>\"If the DNA profile is partial because the sample is degraded, then adventitious matches often occur. However, it is important to remember that the national DNA database is an intelligence database. This means that before a decision to prosecute can be given, all of the evidence in the case must be carefully considered. DNA is never reported in isolation. The jury makes its decision based on all of the evidence presented.\" </p> <p>Prof Jeffreys also gave a warning against keeping DNA records of people who had been wrongly suspected of crimes - something the police have been legally allowed to do since 2001. </p> <p>In certain parts of the country, this could lead to an over-representation of certain ethnic groups and could lead to resentment, he said. The solution was either to delete records of those who had been cleared of any offence or simply to extend DNA profiling to everyone in Britain. </p> <p>He also expressed reservations about the idea of extracting anything more than simple identification data from DNA. \"Police store not only the DNA profile but also the physical DNA,\" he said. \"If they have that, there is the long-term risk that people could access health information in the future. Police have absolutely no right to that information.\" </p> <p>He sought to calm civil liberty fears that police might reach the stage of producing Photofits based solely on DNA information, saying science would be a limiting factor. </p> <p>There are few robust tests for identifying physical characteristics from someone's DNA - such as hair and eye colour and broad ethnic origin - although research in the area is continuing. </p> <p>Outlining the challenges for DNA profiling, he said the basic science had been achieved, but the problems now lay in improving the technology. </p> <p>He asked: \"Can we speed up and simplify the procedure?\" Within a decade, he pointed out, police may have hand-held devices that could profile DNA samples they found at the scene of a crime in a process taking only a few seconds and costing a few pence.</p> <p><strong>A scientific revolution</strong></p> <p><strong> 1984 </strong> Alec Jeffreys, a geneticist at Leicester University, discovers DNA fingerprinting by accident during research while studying how genes differ between people and how they evolve. </p> <p><strong> 1985 </strong> His technique first used to reunite a boy with his family after an immigration dispute.

  "<p>1. Travelling tips </p> <p>Walk or cycle wherever you can to save money (this will have the added benefit of keeping you fit). Some universities have hitching posts - one on campus and one in town in the case of Lancaster. If you take public transport in London, the cheapest option is to pre-pay. Pre-paid bus tickets save you 30p per journey and tube journeys are up to 40p less with an Oyster card, although travelcards are cheaper if you make regular journeys. In Manchester, a young person's bus travelcard is \u00a39.45 for a week or \u00a335 for a month; that's \u00a33.55 and \u00a310 respectively less than the adult fare. </p> <p>For longer journeys, book train tickets well in advance - at least seven days for the cheaper apex tickets. Then save a further 33% with a Young Person's Railcard (\u00a320 a year). London Kings Cross to Edinburgh is \u00a347.50, which is \u00a324.50 cheaper than the full fare (Super Advance return).</p> <p>2. Eating out</p> <p>J D Wetherspoon and Yates's have great meal deals. Get two main meals for a set price, usually \u00a35.99 to \u00a36.99, which saves you around \u00a35 to \u00a36. Based on eating out three times a week, that's \u00a315 to \u00a318 less. Also check out all-you-can-eat buffets, and remember that in happy hours food's often cheaper as well as alcohol.</p> <p>3. Eating in</p> <p>Cooking meals from scratch is best for your budget and health. \"Students can save on food spending by learning to cook before they leave home, bringing supplies with them, using low-cost supermarkets or local markets, buying fresh food - it's usually cheaper than convenience stuff - and sorting out a weekly menu with the people they live with,\" says Lancaster University spokeswoman Beth Broomby. </p> <p>\"Make friends with your local baker, greengrocer, fishmonger and butcher,\" adds Maddy Heil of <a href=\"http://www.thesite.org\">TheSite.org</a>, an advice website for young people. \"Ask them about which ingredients are good value for someone on a tight budget.\" This extends to lunchtime - homemade sandwiches save you about \u00a32 a day. </p> <p>4. Supermarket sweep</p> <p>Instead of expensive well-known brands, buy supermarket own brands or better still their low-cost ranges. Buying Sainsbury's low priced baked beans instead of Heinz's saves you 27p a tin (420g/415g). </p> <p>\"Never go food shopping when you're hungry,\" advises Maddy Heil. \"You'll end up buying snacks and junk food that you don't need. You should work out what you need before you go, and take a shopping list.\"</p> <p>The best time to shop is when the supermarkets are closing, as they discount foods close to their use-by date. And take advantage of offers: at the time of writing, Sainsbury's had red seal cheese (\u00a33.19) and its own chicken portions (\u00a33.29) on a buy-one-get-one-free offer, saving you \u00a36.48 each time you shop. </p> <p>5. Reducing bills</p> <p>Putting on that thermal vest your mum sent you and adjusting your radiator valves by a notch or two can help reduce your gas bill by 10%. Also reduce bills by turning off lights in empty rooms (saving up to 45%), closing doors and curtains to keep heat in, putting on appliances in the early hours when electricity's cheaper, showering instead of bathing (uses less than half the water and less energy) and installing energy-efficient light bulbs (saving up to 75%). All these measures are good for your pocket and the environment. </p> <p>6. Entertainment for less </p> <p>The internet's the home of cheap music, games and films. For CDs, both <a href=\"http://www.play.com/\">Play.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www12.cd-wow.com/\">CD Wow!</a> are great value. The Libertines is \u00a38.99 on both, but \u00a312.99 at HMV stores - saving you \u00a38 if you buy a couple of CDs a month. Alternatively, borrow friends' CDs (although copying them is illegal), or trade in old CDs, DVDs and games at second-hand shops and high street stores like Game. This is recycling at its best. </p> <p>Of course, things tend to be cheaper on the net generally. \"If you're planning to purchase an item or service, like insurance, there are many online sites that compare prices for items and give excellent money-saving tips,\" says Broomby. See <a href=\"http://www.lancs.ac.uk/users/studentsupport/finance/savemoney.htm\">Lancaster Student Support</a> for more.</p> <p>7. Bargain books</p> <p>Books and equipment are must-haves, but you don't need to buy everything new or right away - wait for the course to begin to see what's essential, and use the library as much as possible. Many universities' student unions have second hand stores where you can buy books cheaply and trade your own. You may also be able to share books and equipment with friends, or buy them from students advertising on noticeboards. </p> <p>8. Better budgeting</p> <p>You know you're going to get in debt, but there are ways to minimise the damage. Beth Broomby says: \"It's wise for students to set money aside or to pay for essentials first, like accommodation, when their funding arrives.</p> <p>\"Currently student loans are paid in three termly instalments. Look at the number of weeks this money has to last - you may wish to transfer a weekly amount from one account to another so you know you're spending to plan.\" </p> <p>If you really get into difficulty, there are avenues other than extending or increasing your overdraft. Ms Broomby recommends the university's Access to Learning Fund: \"Applicants are means-tested, but the grants do not need to be repaid.\"</p> <p>Maddy Heil adds: \"Educational charities and trusts often give money to very specific groups of students (up to about \u00a3300). Try your LEA, student union, careers services or Citizens Advice Bureau. Student services also offer scholarships and prizes.</p> <p>\"When you're a student, every little bit of extra cash helps, which is why these extra sources of funding are worth checking out.\"</p> <p>9. Drinking out</p> <p>Student bars are often the cheapest places to drink - you can save \u00a31.50 a pint. Off campus, happy hours in pubs make your money go further. </p> <p>Pub chains like J D Wetherspoon and Yates's are great value all the time. A pint of Carling in Yate's is \u00a31.69 (regions vary), around \u00a31 cheaper than many others. </p> <p>\"Try turning up at the bar later than usual to minimise your drinking time, or kick off with a soft drink to stop you feeling thirsty,\" advises Maddy Heil. </p> <p>10. Drinking in</p> <p>Another option is to drink at home. Sainsbury's has a 24-pack of Carling for \u00a313.99, which works out at just 75p a pint; up to \u00a32 less than bar prices.</p>",
  "<b>Beslan tragedy</b> <br> The Tory leader, Michael Howard joined the prime minister in condemning those responsible for the Beslan school siege. Mr Blair said he had offered the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, Britain's sympathy and condolences. <p>\"We share in Russia's grief in this dark hour for their country and we mourn with the people of Beslan as they continue to bury their dead,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Blair said video footage of the siege underlined \"the inhumanity of terrorists who can target and murder children\". It was \"evil beyond the contemplation of anyone\". Mr Howard said he joined Mr Blair in expressing \"our anguish and heartache at terrible events in Beslan\". </p> <p><b>Andrew Smith</b><br> The prime minister expressed regret over the resignation of Andrew Smith as work and pensions secretary, paying tribute to his \"very substantial contribution\" to reducing unemployment and helping the poorest pensioners. </p> <p>Mr Howard taunted Mr Blair over Mr Smith's resignation ahead of an expected reshuffle, saying friends of the former minister had said he was sick and tired of three months of \"poison and briefing against him\". He demanded: \"Who could possibly have been responsible for that?\" Mr Blair insisted the two party leaders should debate policy instead of personalities. </p> <p><b>Pensions</b><br> The \"decent and honourable\" Mr Smith has been brought down by spin while Britain's pensions are in a \"shambles\", David Willetts, for the Tories, claimed. He warned of \"a serious and growing crisis\" in pensions as he opened a debate on the issue. Pensions minister Malcolm Wicks attacked the Tory legacy on pensions and rubbished their current policy as \"unaffordable, unsustainable and unfair\". </p> <p><b>Hunting</b><br> Mr Blair refused to be drawn on when the government will introduce legislation to ban hunting with dogs. Labour's David Winnick asked: \"Are you aware that, if reports are accurate, action is going to be taken within this fortnight to bring into law the hunting with dogs bill that will be warmly welcomed on this side of the house.\" The prime minister replied: \"I have said that we will find a way of resolving this issue and we will.\" </p> <p><b>Anti-social behaviour</b><br> Powerful tools are in place to tackle anti-social behaviour and it is up to law enforcers to find imaginative ways to use them, the prime minister said. Powers to close drug houses, impose on-the-spot fines and target very young children whose parents were not exercising proper parental responsibility were all in place. He said: \"There are a whole series of measures to deal with this now and it simply requires an imaginative use of them at the local level.\" </p> <p><b>Children's hospices</b><br> The prime minister defended the funding given to children's hospices but conceded there was a need to do more. Tory Bob Spink told him facilities for terminally-ill youngsters received just 5% of funding from the state. Mr Blair told him: \"We are always aware of the need to do more; we will try to do more but I think it is important to recognise that we have increased significantly the funding.\" </p> <p><b>Mobile phone masts</b><br> Mr Blair said scientific evidence should be the basis for deciding on the siting of mobile phone masts. He was pressed by Tory Dr Andrew Murrison to force firms to go through the normal planning process to get permission for the masts. The prime minister said: \"Of course people should be consulted about it but it is also important that we make the phone system work adequately.\" </p> <p><b>Olympics</b><br> All members of the British Olympic team performed \"superbly\" in Athens, Mr Blair said. \"I am sure the whole house would wish to send them our best wishes and thanks.\" The games had been raised by Jane Griffiths who singled out her constituent - gold-medallist sailor Sarah Webb - for particular praise. </p> <p><b>War pensions</b><br> The government was defeated in the Lords over war pensions claims. Voting was 183 to 128 during the armed forces (pensions and compensation) bill's report stage. Peers on all sides supported a move by Labour's former minister for the disabled Lord Morris, shifting the burden of proof for eligibility for the war pension scheme to the benefit of the doubt going to the claimant. </p> <p><b>Northern Ireland</b><br> Critical all-party talks next week will be the \"moment of decision\" for the Northern Ireland peace process, the Northern Ireland secretary, Paul Murphy, said. He told the Commons the \"ingredients\" were in place to reach an agreement on restoring devolved government in the province but warned intensive negotiations at Leeds Castle, Kent were not a staging post for further discussions. </p> <p><b>NHS hospitals</b><br> The government's obsession with targets has frustrated effective infection control procedures being implemented in NHS hospitals, shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley claimed. He accused ministers of failing to address MRSA, the so-called superbug, and other hospital-acquired infections with sufficient urgency. </p> <p>The health secretary, John Reid, acknowledged that bringing down the infection rate was a \"major challenge\" but added: \"Estimates that we have show that up to 9% of in-patients acquire infection of some kind. They also show ... that this has not changed materially since 1980.\" </p> <p><b>Visually-impaired children</b><br> Children who are visually-impaired still face problems in accessing literature in a form they can read, Liberal Democrat Annette Brooke warned. She said they were \"not getting the accessible information they need to ensure they have opportunities equal to their non-disabled peers, both in education and in leisure reading\". Her access to literature (visually impaired children) bill gained its first reading but stands no chance of becoming law because of lack of time. </p> <p><b>Intestacy</b><br> The government is to consider raising amounts to which a husband or wife is entitled when their spouse dies without leaving a will. Junior constitutional affairs minister Lord Filkin said consultations would take place this autumn and the government would set out its proposals in a paper. </p> <p><b>New lords</b><br> Liberal Democrat Lord Vallance of Tummel - Royal Bank of Scotland vice-chairman Sir Iain Vallance - and crossbencher Baroness Chapman - Nicola Jane Chapman, chairman of Leeds United Disabled Organisation - took their Lords seats. </p> <p><b>In parliament today</b><br> There are Commons questions to the education secretary, Charles Clarke, and the solicitor general, Harriet Harman. The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, opens a debate on the European constitution. The Lords debates the housing bill's committee stage and school inspections.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>BREAKING NEWS:</b> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/indonesia/Story/0,2763,1300500,00.html\">Seven people were killed today in a car bomb attack on the Australian embassy in Jakarta</a>.</p> <p><b>'TALE OF TWO RESHUFFLES'</b></p> <p>\"Milburn gets job, but little power\" notes the Sun in one of those underwhelming headlines that betray a paper's true agenda. Despite the determinedly implacable noises coming from the Treasury yesterday, Gordon Brown will be seething at the news that the former health secretary, Alan Milburn, has been given a \"policy supremo\" role at Downing Street.</p> <p>\"A meaningless phrase, frankly, but it's very destabilising,\" a \"friend of the chancellor\" tells the FT. \"Milburn return deprives Brown of election role\", splashes the paper.</p> <p>Will Tony Blair's move prompt that long-awaited showdown between the prime minister and his chancellor, splitting the party and letting Michael Howard into Downing Street? The Telegraph certainly hopes so. \"Suddenly, there is everything to play for,\" smiles an excited leader writer. Yesterday's Conservative reshuffle - unlike Labour's - \"electrified Westminster ... the Conservative front bench now looks more like an alternative government than at any time since 1997.\"</p> <p>John Redwood is the new shadow minister for deregulation - a \"remarkable comeback\" for a man nicknamed \"the Vulcan\", says the Telegraph - and the \"old stager\" Nicholas Soames becomes shadow defence secretary. \"Rising star\" David Cameron is in charge of policy coordination.</p> <p>Mr Blair's reshuffle marks a \"big turnaround\" for the prime minister, according to the Times. He \"seriously discussed\" standing down in the summer, \"but was talked out of it by Mr Brown, among others\". All the more infuriating for the chancellor, then, that two Blairites (Alan Johnson replaces Andrew Smith as work and pensions secretary) have been drafted in to the cabinet. </p> <p>James Blitz, writing in the FT, says Mr Blair \"regrets bitterly\" his decision to allow Mr Brown to \"set his stamp\" on the 2001 manifesto. It \"set out few original policy ideas and left the government having to sell controversial policies such as higher education top-up fees mid term,\" Blitz says.</p> <p>But are the Brownites and Blairites really so different? Irreconcilable, maybe, says the Guardian's Michael White, but fundamentally not so dissimilar. \"The tragedy for Labour is that the Brown and Blairites are all modernisers in their different ways. The chancellor knows how to sing Old Labour tunes better, but is a harder paymaster on public spending than Blair. There are significant disagreements of approach and priority, but it suits both sides to exaggerate them: what Freud called the narcissism of small difference.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Politics/labour/story/0,9061,1300343,00.html\">Milburn wins central Labour role</a><br> * <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/labour/story/0,9061,1300458,00.html\">Michael White: Familiar tantrums</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/09/ntory09.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/09/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Tories top-up top table</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/09/09/dl0902.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/09/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Square the circle</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1253333,00.html\">Times: Brown stopped PM quitting</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/1f42487a-0047-11d9-ad31-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Discord threatened if Milburn returns</a></p> <p><b>ON THE US CAMPAIGN TRAIL</b></p> <p>Dick Cheney warned Americans yesterday that electing John Kerry would make them more vulnerable to terrorist attacks.</p> <p>Accusing the Democratic candidate of peddling the misconception that the US was not truly at war, the vice president told Republicans in Iowa: \"If we make the wrong choice, then the danger is that we'll get hit again and we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating.\"</p> <p>A poll highlighted on the front of the Herald Tribune will probably prove a mixed blessing for Mr Kerry: it suggests that if the whole world were voting in November, he would win by a landslide.

I've been writing this column for nearly two years, and I still haven't managed to stiff a single multinational cosmetics firm: they're just too good at constructing legally defensible pseudoscience. I'm picturing huge laboratories and rows of scientists writing incomprehensible but legally sound babble onto their clipboards. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cosmetics companies take laboratory data - stuff at a molecular level, the behaviour of cells in a glass dish - and then pretend it's the same as the ultimate issue of whether something makes you look nice. This amino acid, they say, is crucial for collagen formation. Perfectly true, along with 19 others. No evidence to say that anyone is deficient in it, and, crucially, no explicit claim from the company that rubbing that actual amino acid on your face is what is going to make you look better. That link is made only in the customer's mind: because the claim that the cream makes you look good is an entirely separate one, made for the cream as a whole, and it's true, because all creams will hydrate your skin and make you look good. Vaseline, as it happens, also does it rather well, but leaves a greasy sheen. And most cosmetics research, since you ask, comes down to conserving the moisturising properties of Vaseline, but avoiding the greasiness. Diprobase, at less than \u00a310 for a half-litre tub, represents a pretty good stab at solving this problem. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> What about the other magic ingredients? One thing kind of works: cooked and broken-up protein (hydrolysed X-microprotein nutricomplexes, or whatever they're calling them this month). These are long soggy chains of amino acids, which contract when they dry, and so temporarily contract your wrinkles. That's temporarily. And all the expensive creams have got that in them anyway. A couple of other things kind of work. Vitamin C, and alpha-hydroxy acids affect skin significantly, although only at such high concentrations that they also cause irritation, stinging, burning and redness: so now they have to be watered down, to pretty useless dilutions. But companies can still name them on the label, and wallow in the glory of their efficacy at higher potencies, because by law you don't have to give the doses of your ingredients, only their ranked order. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Now, I'm begging you, find me one that makes a properly fraudulent pseudoscientific claim I can write about without getting sued, and I'll give you a free tub of Diprobase.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Please send your bad science to <a href=\"mailto:bad.science@theguardian.com\">bad.science@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>'It was built to be a modern, efficient, healthy and, all in all, pleasant place to live. Many Britons find this amusing.\" That's how Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, in their book Good Omens, describe Milton Keynes, a town for which neither heaven nor hell is prepared to take credit. </p> <p>But even with one of the highest densities of roundabouts in the country, not to mention the notorious concrete cows, there are far worse places to live than Milton Keynes. The ridicule it suffers is more a reflection of our instinctive scepticism about the idea of rationally designing a city. </p> <p>Ever since the 19th century, urban design has had an uneasy relationship with science. Amid the grimy horrors of the Industrial Revolution, cities became viewed as inherently undesirable. </p> <p>\"Town planning began as an attempt not to understand cities but to replace them with something better,\" says Bill Hillier, director of the Space Syntax Laboratory at University College London. Idealists like Robert Owen aimed to create a bucolic-industrial utopia, and paved the way for \"balanced urban environments\" such as garden cities. </p> <p>These visions didn't really have any theory. They sounded nicer than the bleak, regimented industrial cities that American social theorist Lewis Mum ford dubbed Coketown in the 1930s, but were they truly more conducive to healthy living? What made the problem particularly hard was that no one was quite sure what urban design was. To some, it was architecture writ large, which meant it should embrace the modernism of Le Corbusier. To others, it was a form of social planning that should be rooted in economics. </p> <p>But the science-based work of Hillier, and his spinoff company Space Syntax, takes a different point of view. If we are going to design good cities, says Hillier, we need first to observe them scientifically to deduce their fundamental rules. He believes good urban planning means relinquishing some control. Cities are organic: they grow, evolve and adapt. \"I wouldn't design a new city,\" Hillier says. \"I'd grow one.\" </p> <p>This perspective goes back to Mumford, who called the growth of a great city amoeboid. He thought the uncontrolled sprawl of big US cities alienating and disempowering. His protege Jane Jacobs argued that we should trust to the self-organising vitality of cities rather than received ideas of what they should look like. </p> <p>In her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jacobs attacked urban renewal schemes as a \"mad spree of deceptions and vandalism and waste\". Her ideas gave rise to the movement known as New Urbanism, which argues that good cities emphasise characteristics such as walkability, diversity, neighbourhood structure and sustainability. Hillier says his work is an attempt to put Jacobs' ideas into scientific form. </p> <p>Some basic ideas of this organic approach to urban design, such as self-organisation and emergence, are now familiar from the area of science dubbed complexity theory. This month, the Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment will bring together architects and designers influenced by complexity, such as Charles Jencks, alongside theorists like Hillier and scientists working on complexity in biology and physics. This is not bandwagon-boarding; Hillier has spent more than 20 years looking for emergent laws in the interactions between space, objects and human movement. </p> <p>\"Space is a lawful thing,\" he says. The basic propositions seem obvious: for example, if you place an object in an open space, then the more centrally it is placed, the more it interferes with movement and visibility. By using these first principles, one can understand how different arrangements of buildings shape patterns of movement and social function. </p> <p>Cities, says Hillier, have two main functions. In business areas, space is shaped to encourage movement and encounters between people, generating activity and trade. And there are residential areas, where movement and activity is more controlled. </p> <p>Comparisons between many different cities and cultures seem to point to a universal spatial pattern which Hillier calls \"deformed wheel\": a centre linked by radial \"spokes\" to a surrounding grid of residential areas. This pattern, which can be discerned from Tokyo to Venice to Baltimore, repeats at different scales: in local districts as well as in the whole city. </p> <p>By encouraging free flow of pedestrians and traffic, the spokes promote safety, in contrast to the preference of some planners to \"put us all in cul-de-sacs\". Hillier says that superimposed on this universal structure are culture-specific variations: the complex residential districts of Arabic cities, for example, reflect a stronger separation of public and private life. </p> <p>Space Syntax, headed by Hillier's former student Tim Stonor, used these ideas to plan the reconstruction of Trafalgar Square, previously an island surrounded by traffic in which tourists (but not locals) milled about while trying to avoid pigeon droppings. \"'Suits' used to walk around the edge,\" says Stonor. \"Now, 13 times more Londoners use the square.\" </p> <p>Space Syntax developed the design by combining on-the-street observations of patterns of pedestrian movement with computer modelling that assumed people's movements are controlled primarily by their lines of sight. The company also worked on the redevelopment of King's Cross, and is drawing up schemes to turn Elephant and Castle roundabout into \"the Trafalgar Square of south London.\" </p> <p>Space syntax won't tell us how to make a \"perfect\" city, but can help to avoid bad ones. While using science as a tool for social planning has often been regarded a potential weapon of totalitarianism, Hillier stresses that in architecture and urban design it is merely a handmaid of art. He compares the \"rules\" of space with those of language. </p> <p>\"The laws of language do not tell us what to say, but prescribe the structure and the limits of the sayable.\" Architecture is, he believes, not a battleground but a meeting place. \"It is not half art and half science, but fully art and fully science.\"</p>",
  "Over the weekend an obliging animal rights enthusiast appeared before the cameras with \"terrorist\" written across her forehead. How helpful if this fashion for forehead-labelling were to catch on. Not only would it save social awkwardness at parties, serving as an invaluable aide memoire for those of us who hate to ask, \"And what do you do?\", yet occasionally forget the correct term for, say, Alastair Campbell (\"git\"); it might also be a powerful deterrent to users of euphemisms. <p>In the UK Prevention of Terrorism Act 1976, terrorism is defined as \"the use of violence for political ends [including] any use of violence for the purpose of putting the public or any section of the public in fear\". In the past year, livelier sections of the animal rights community have energetically used violence to put several, carefully targeted sections of the public in fear. So much so, that numerous members of the public have capitulated to their demands. And yet, these strikingly successful terrorists are rarely identified by their proper name. Instead, they are called animal rights \"extremists\", or \"activists\", even just \"protesters\". As if they were just crosser, or a bit more radical, than the average member of the RSPCA. </p> <p>Perhaps, in the context of al-Qaida's massacres, the blowing up of Israeli buses, and the slaughter and abuse of children which Tony Blair has described as \"extreme terrorism\", milder terms seem more appropriate for our domestic product. But if terrorism must now be identified with acts so unspeakable they seem to render the word, by itself, inadequate, this should not prevent our home-grown, less extreme specialists in fear from being known for what they are. </p> <p>In fact, other than the fear of their reprisals, the only persuasive reason for calling these bullies by a prettier name is their obvious delight in posing as freedom fighters, aligning themselves with Nelson Mandela as if there were some sort of telling similarity between the historic cause of black South Africans and the ones they have devised for British foxes and guinea pigs, to mention just a couple of the animals whose needs are currently considered paramount. So far, there seems to have been limited interest in freedom fighting on behalf of the creatures daily oppressed by the men from pest control: ants, beetles, moths and rats. </p> <p>For the species du jour, however, no sacrifice is too great. \"If we are not giving it 100%, then we're simply not giving it enough,\" writes a contributor to Arkangel, one of the more excitable websites, urging recruits to get behind various campaigns of violence and intimidation; \"this isn't a hobby, it's a way of life that we've all chosen. We KNOW it's a better way of life for us, for the animals and for the planet, so isn't it worth fighting for?\" If this writer does not define precisely what is meant by \"fighting\", other correspondents are less squeamish, posting bragging accounts of their attacks on everything from cement companies to circuses to individuals who have offended their principles. Each boast - or \"communique\" - is accompanied by a decorative, monochrome image of a hooded ALF operative and his/her grateful beagle. </p> <p>\"Like avenging angels we struck. Headlights smashed, tyres slashed, windscreens shattered and cables cut on cement-mixing and digging vehicles at the RMC quarry,\" writes one warrior, ordering RMC, the cement company to, \"Sever your contract with Oxford University, as if you don't, actions against you are only set to increase and you will end up remaining on the ALF hit-list as a valid and high-profile target for many, many years to come.\" RMC has since disappeared from the site of Oxford's new research laboratory, along with the builders Montpellier PLC, which pulled out of the project in July, a decision hailed by militants as their victory. </p> <p>Back at Arkangel, another criminal describes what his colleagues would call a \"home visit\" to the house of a named City worker: \"we covered his home with red and black paint and slogan's (sic) denouncing his involvement with Huntingdon Life Sciences. We also cut his cable, DSL, and numerous phonelines to impede any work from home.\" </p> <p>Although many animal liberation sites are now careful to repudiate violence, while celebrating the great strides violence has recently made for their cause, the freedom with which their colleagues gloat over their achievements and promise more nasty surprises if their victims do not capitulate, must be the envy of less principled bruisers. It is hard to imagine rival neighbourhood gangs, or football supporters, for example, openly inviting attacks on the homes of law-abiding families whose addresses they advertise for this purpose: animal rights thuggery seems to enjoy protected status. </p> <p>For months, as the BBC's John Waite described in his powerful Face the Facts report, animal rights campaigners have been trying out a new tactic, targeting all contacts of the Hall guinea pig farm. They intimidated, and threatened, and vandalised property belonging to associates, neighbours and employees of the Halls, effectively terrorising a whole village until its residents agreed to sever contact with the Halls. A golf course was vandalised, because the Halls used its gym. A publican's windows were broken, because he served the Halls. Activists have regularly been heard in the media crowing over their success, presumably confident that, in their case, their will be no prosecutions for inciting violence. </p> <p>As well as frightening golf clubs and pubs into submission, this escalation of violence and threatening behaviour has helped the animal rights militants no end, by stifling debate on the best way to improve conditions for animals. Has any other contentious subject been so effectively closed down? Who wants a brick through the window? Or their address on the ALF supporters' website? The result is that, nowadays, it often seems that the only animal rights argument left is about tactics. In interviews, militants are regularly allowed to claim, absolutely and preposterously, that medical research on animals has achieved nothing for human health; they continually assert, without ever being challenged to account for them, the existence of animal rights; they are never pressed to explain why certain species and activities, particularly certain British species and activities, seem to excite them, on the animals' behalf, so much more than others. </p> <p>It will have helped their sense of unerring righteousness no end that ever since it took \u00a31m from the Political Animal Lobby (followed by a few generous top-ups), the government has been in a deeply compromised position on fox-hunting, on which Blair as good as guaranteed a ban. New adverts placed by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, headed \"You Promised\", have something of the same \"or else\" tone as the threats on the Arkangel website. But Blair has himself to blame. He must have known that, although the Labour party hates hunting for traditional, class reasons, the animal rights activists hate it because they imagine that foxes have rights. Once this much is conceded - to their satisfaction, at least - with a ban on hunting, they will leave the foxes to their poison and traps and move on, without further argument, to fight for the rights of such other creatures as happen to appeal to them. Duly assaulting the rights of any humans unfortunate enough to get in their way, whether by supplying concrete or having the wrong friends. </p> <p>It is lowering, but not altogether surprising, that the home secretary's response to animal rights terrorism has been yet further restriction of freedom of speech. Although incapable of halting the intimidation in Oxford, at Hall Farm, and elsewhere, David Blunkett was happy to ban one Jerry Vlasak, apparently considered something of an orator in animal terrorist circles, from coming to address an animal liberation conference (at which delegates were themselves warned to watch out for police and press). </p> <p>Vlasak naturally appeared on video instead, in complicit, injuriously censored mode, urging his troops to picture their own family members as laboratory animals, and to imagine themselves \"the Nelson Mandelas of tomorrow\". Thanks to Blunkett, such fantasies of noble victimhood must have come all the easier. Since it took PAL's \u00a31m in 1996, the government has forfeited objectivity on animal rights, countenanced campaigns of violence and persecution by the movement's wannabe Mandelas, and is now, with quite extraordinary lack of foresight, acting out the role these terrorists have designed for it, as an oppressor of human rights. However painful the prospect, Vlasak should be invited over, and invited often, and made to explain why the violence of animal lovers is, as he puts it, \"morally justified\".</p>",
  "<p>Cricketing folklore suggests that West Indies' debutant Clayton Lambert announced his arrival on the world stage by wagering with a friend that he could pick him out in the crowd with a well-placed six during the fifth Test against England at The Oval in 1991.</p> <p>The legend follows that the friend placed himself behind a sight-screen and began counting the ways he would spend his winnings, until an Ian Botham delivery was sent speeding into the rapidly-fleeing crowd at long-on. </p> <p>\"I did hit Botham for six, that is true,\" admits Lambert, \"but that is not the type of wager I would make. It would be foolish to make those boasting kind of wagers.\"</p> <p>Whether apocryphal or not, the story encapsulates the reputation Lambert has carried with him to his adopted homeland of the USA, for whom, at the spritely age of 42, he will spearhead the ICC Champions Trophy campaign starting today against New Zealand at The Oval.</p> <p>It's been 13 years since he first set foot in the south London cricket ground, and Lambert will return there as the highest profile member of an ageing group of cricketers that defied all expectation by winning the ICC Six Nations tournament in Sharjah earlier this year.</p> <p>Coming in as a late replacement for Kenya, who withdrew because of a prior commitment to tour the West Indies, the USA qualified for the Champions Trophy by the miniscule margin of 0.028 on net run-rate after seeing off Scotland, Canada, Holland, Namibia and the United Arab Emirates. But after being grouped with Australia and New Zealand, Lambert understands that the learning curve becomes immeasurably steeper over the next four days.</p> <p>\"Look, we're going to get a lesson here. With the likes of Brett Lee, Glenn McGrath and Michael Kasprowicsz, we know what we're up against,\" says Lambert, \"but we're not going to say we're not going to come, because we see this as a reward for our efforts in the ICC tournament in Sharjah.</p> <p>\"Our main strength is in the batting; the two openers are pretty destructive - Rohan Alexander and Mark Johnson, while No3 Steve Massiah scored a hundred the other day, and he's the prodigy of the side. He's young and strikes the ball well. Batting-wise we go pretty deep.\"</p> <p>Consider yourself a sports buff? Well then, what's the oldest modern sporting event in the world? If you plumped for the 1896 Athens Olympics, or even the FA Cup, which started in 1871/72, you'd be sadly mistaken. </p> <p>In fact, it's the annual USA versus Canada cricket match that began way back in 1844 when more than 10,000 spectators turned up at Bloomingdale Park in New York. And, as if to confirm cricket's ancestral, if uneasy, relationship with gambling, about \u00a367,000 (roughly \u00a3840,000 in today's currency) were placed on the outcome - a Canadian win by 23 runs. </p> <p>So why hasn't cricket flourished in those parts from such an auspicious beginning? </p> <p>Almost undoubtedly, cricket would have been seen in some quarters as a British colonial imposition, even if any residual anger from the American War of Independence would have had over 60 years to dissipate. Much of the USA's national identity was formed through the invention of parochial sports such as baseball (1845), American football (1879) and basketball (1891), so any game with such an obvious link to a recent-past foe was always going to struggle to gain traction. </p> <p>What followed, instead, was that as cricket became more and more alien on the traditional American sporting landscape, the more it became part of an underground subculture supported almost exclusively by immigrants from cricket-playing nations. </p> <p>\"The cricket is improving in America,\" argues Lambert, \"but it's still mainly players from Commonwealth countries that have a cricketing background that are making up the teams. </p> <p>\"But ever so slowly there are a lot of young Americans starting to play the game, especially in California. It will be a gradual process; cricket is a very slow game, and the development works that work as well.</p> <p>\"The most important thing is education. The thing about cricket crowds in America is education because you can only enjoy it if you know the rules.</p> <p>\"Americans don't know a lot about the rules (of cricket), and there are a lot of rules to learn in cricket.\"</p> <p>Although completely amateur, there are still 10,000 registered players who take to public parks on predominantly matting and astro-turf pitches in all 50 states (there are only four turf wickets in the whole country). The heartbeat of American cricket is geographically diverse; spreading from New York, New Jersey, and Chicago, to southern states Florida, and Texas, all the way to California on the west coast. </p> <p>The establishment of 500 clubs within 29 regional leagues shows that the sport is taking giant strides in shedding its boutique status.</p> <p>One major hurdle that still faces cricketing missionaries in America is the dearth of media coverage, and Lambert agrees that little looks to be changing in that regard in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>\"There's still no mainstream media coverage, we're pretty much only covered on the internet,\" he said. \"We're still a very minor sport so the media probably don't even know that we're over here, but sooner or later we will make the kind of impact that will make them interested.\"</p> <p>The USA will have their appetites whetted for the Australian match on Monday by their clash today against New Zealand, and as if they weren't facing enough of a Samson-and-Goliath battle already, 42-year-old all-rounder Tony Reid is unlikely to face the Kiwis after becoming stranded in Florida due to Hurricanes Frances' destructive trail. But Lambert believes no matter what the result, they cannot lose.</p> <p>\"We don't have the skill of the professional players but we're doing our thing and in the league we're out to compete in, we think we're doing a creditable job,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We're happy to be here, and we're going to give as good as we can, and if our best is not good enough then so be it. Our team has so much to learn - and they're very good students - so I'm sure this experience is going to mean a lot to them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Australian cafe culture has trumped the country's one-time addiction to cigarettes, with the Sydney suburb of Mosman becoming the first in the world to ban smoking at pavement cafes. </p> <p>Cigarettes were once so integral to life in Australia that half the population were regular smokers and work coffee breaks were nicknamed \"smokoes\", but the entire country is now on course to join Norway and Ireland in phasing out smoking in pubs and clubs by 2007. </p> <p>Mosman has gone one step further, with laws coming into effect from the middle of next month which will outlaw smoking on roads and pavements within 20 metres (65ft) of outdoor dining areas. Smokers will also be banned from beaches and council-owned buildings, and from a small public park facing Sydney Harbour at Balmoral Beach. </p> <p>Stretching around the north shore of the harbour, Mosman is one of Australia's most affluent suburbs and has the lowest rates of smoking in New South Wales. </p> <p>\"These days smokers aren't allowed to smoke inside restaurants, so the outdoor areas of restaurants have become the smoke zone,\" the deputy mayor, Andrew Brown, told Australian Associated Press. \"Anyone who wants to dine outside has to suffer the toxic cocktail that ... you're forced to inhale when you sit with them. I'm protecting the civil liberties of those that choose not to smoke.\" </p> <p>Decisions by two other Sydney councils in May have already turned the beaches at Bondi, Manly, Tamarama and Bronte into no-smoking zones. Legislation being passed in Queensland will go further, and ban smoking at outdoor dining areas and patrolled beaches across the entire state by 2006. </p> <p>Roughly 20% of the Australian population are smokers, compared with about 25% in Britain. Smoking has been banned in all Australian workplaces except pubs and bars, and at all indoor restaurant tables, for several years. </p> <p>Mr Brown said the new Mosman regulations had been prompted by the numbers of people smoking at pavement tables outside cafes and restaurants. </p> <p>Even the smoko itself has not been immune to the change in attitudes, with a survey last year finding that nearly half of Australian workers resented their colleagues for taking cigarette breaks. </p> <p>Anne Jones, the chief executive of the anti-smoking group Ash Australia, said that up to 90% of Australians supported smoke-free pubs and bars. </p> <p>\"We still have 19,000 deaths a year caused by smoking,\" she said. \"We know that if you put in these sorts of restrictions you can reduce overall consumption by up to 20% and you can reduce smoking among young people, so we're going to see better health and lives saved by this sort of legislation.\" </p> <p>However, the Surf Life Savers Association in Queensland warned that the legislation could drive swimmers who wished to smoke away from patrolled beaches, leaving them without the protection of lifeguards. </p> <p>Appeals from Australia's powerful gambling lobby also mean that casinos in most states are exempt from banning smoking in \"high roller\" rooms where wealthy gamblers can play in private.</p>",

  "<p>Here we go again. Another hapless British couple moving away from the winter frosts, this time to the Andalusian hills above Malaga. There'll be all the usual problems, the builders will shrug and say \"ma\u00f1ana\" a lot, our couple won't have the language to make things happen, savings will disappear as nothing gets done and British tears will fall on Spanish soil. </p> <p>But wait ... this isn't Our Nightmare in the Sun or whatever those desperate programmes are called. We're not dealing with a beautiful crumbly farmhouse that turns from dream to nightmare. It's <strong> Grand Designs Abroad</strong> (Channel 4), and this one really is totally grand. Gil, an architect, and Hilary his wife buy eight acres of hillside-with-a-view, then, along with their son who's also an architect, they design the house they want to retire to - which turns out to be the house I want to retire to too. </p> <p>Gil's not one to sit around and weep. He knows what he wants and he seems to get it. First he hires Paco who's not a ma\u00f1ana builder but very much a hoy builder, and sometimes alarms his clients with the speed of his work. Not only can Paco lay a 500 sq metre concrete roof in a single sitting, but he's also a prominent member of the local community, has wicked paella parties, and is a very useful man to know. Gil's Spanish improves at roughly the same rate as his house goes up - no, that's not quite true, because in the end the house is perfect. </p> <p>It's a beautiful thing, to watch an imaginative new building go from foundations to fruition - far more interesting than seeing an old finca get a new floor, shutters and a swimming pool, which is what you usually see when a move to Spain is turned into television. There are a few problems. A local law decrees that all buildings must be white. Nonsense, says Gil, and paints his dark blue, mint green and terracotta. And with Paco on your side, you can make anything happen. </p> <p>The end result is stunning. Blocks of concrete and glass cling to the hillside like a little village. It's cool and modern, curved and straight, outrageous and yet it also fits in perfectly to its surroundings. Even the mayor seems quite amused by the eccentric Ingleses and their funny modern house. </p> <p>Presenter Kevin McCloud ponces around throughout, with his fancy shirts and his big, overannunciated adjectives. But - and the ladies may disagree with me on this - there's only one star in this show, and that's the house. Now Hilary and Gil, if you wouldn't mind: hurry up and finish retiring so I can move in ... </p> <p>In <strong> Don't Worry</strong> (Channel 4), my colleague John Vidal, the Guardian's environment editor, is being interviewed by a puppet with a blue face. John's trying to explain that although Shell says it has mended its ways and is committed to saving the planet, that may not be the whole picture. But the puppet's having none of it. \"Don't worry about John,\" he says. \"Cos he's just one of those cynical journalists.\" And to show that John's talking rubbish, he shows an advert - from Shell. </p> <p>And that's how it goes. A puppet talks to someone who knows, and is concerned about the oil industry and the environment. Then the puppet finds \"evidence\", usually in the form of a press release, a statement from the company, or an advert, saying that there's nothing to be alarmed about. Satire, of course. </p> <p>It's a strange idea and its late-night slot suggests that Channel 4 bosses aren't totally convinced, but I quite liked it. It could prove popular with stoned students. </p> <p>In <strong> Who Rules the Roost?</strong> (BBC2), about a couple struggling to juggle twin jobs with twin girls, Joanne throws her spaghetti bolognese on the floor, smashing the bowl, and bursts into tears. I'm sure that's perfectly normal behaviour, but Joanne is the mum. </p> <p>Not having children, I don't suppose I'm really the prime target audience for this one, but I did find it mind-numbingly tedious. Joanne and Mark take it in turns to give up work for a couple of weeks to stay at home with their girls. They bicker and mope, and get jealous of each other when one turns out to be better at something than the other (again, it's the parents I'm on about here). Are they going to be able to potty-train the girls, get them to use proper cups? Will they decide that one of the parents needs to give up work, and if so who? Can their relationship get back on track? Who rules the roost? And more importantly, who cares?</p>",
  "<p>The BBC has written to more than 25 potential bidders and organisations interested in its commercial assets, soliciting their views on the future of the business. This unusual move comes as rival media firms and financiers queue up to express an interest in BBC Worldwide properties, which are worth an estimated \u00a31bn. </p> <p>BSkyB, for example, has made it clear that it would be interested in taking a stake in UKTV, the BBC joint venture with cable group Flextech, if it became available. Channel 4 and Five have also expressed an interest in the business. </p> <p>One indication of the level of interest generated by assets ranging from top-selling magazines such as the Radio Times to the BBC's international distribution arm, came from an investment banker who said yesterday that he was meeting a dozen venture capitalists over the coming days to discuss the business. </p> <p>Amid this frenzy of interest, senior BBC executives have tried to downplay expectations of a sale, saying a desire to improve efficiencies may not lead to wholesale sell-off and that no decision has been made. Such comments are partly seen as a way of boosting morale at BBC Worldwide, where staff believe the corporate review being carried out will end in job cuts. </p> <p>John Smith, in charge of the review process, told about 100 senior Worldwide managers this week that he had written to a \"long list\" of media and publishing companies, industry bodies, investment banks and private financiers. </p> <p>Among those contacted were Time Warner and Walt Disney. Other recipients include German group Bertelsmann, Telewest, the Discovery channel, ITV and Channel 4, as well as CIBC, Rothschild, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley. </p> <p>Bertelsmann said it was not aware of any talks but chief executive Gunter Thielen said: \"We will pursue appropriate opportunities when they become available.\" </p> <p>The BBC denied reports that the letters represented an invitation to bid for Worldwide. A spokeswoman said: \"People have not been invited to make bids. We are talking to anyone who can make a contribution or has a view on our commercial operations.\" </p> <p>One BBC insider suggested the communication was designed to head off criticism of the BBC's handling of the study: \"They don't want to leave anyone out and leave the whole process open to the charge of an internal stitch-up.\" </p> <p>The unusual handling of the review process has prompted criticism of the BBC from inside and outside the organisation. One senior executive, who refused to be named, called the review process \"agonising\". \"The trouble is that the process was launched without any understanding of what the outcome is going to be ... A huge amount of paper shuffling could simply result in the sale of the water fountain in the corner of the office.\" </p> <p>There was a \"huge amount of dissent internally\". </p> <p>Other BBC insiders said the process of writing to rivals to solicit advice was part of the political make-up of the corporation. The review of BBC Worldwide is running alongside the government's study of the corporation's funding formula in the run-up to charter renewal in 2006 and a regulatory review of its public service remit. </p> <p>The uncertainty surrounding the review is matched by uncertainty about how to value Worldwide's accounts. </p> <p>According to its annual review, the business returned \u00a3141m to the BBC in the year to March 31 after making a profit before interest and tax of \u00a337m. </p> <p>\"The accounts are incredibly opaque,\" said one financier. \"We just don't know how they make their money.\" </p> <p>Several believe that the corporation may be looking for licensing deals or joint ventures as a way of realising more value from its commercial assets. </p> <p>UKTV has attracted a huge amount of interest in spite of the fact that it could be one of the most complicated units to unwind. A change of control clause would be triggered if a sale were made of any part of the joint venture with Flextech. </p> <p>Andrew Buckhurst, a spokesman for Bertelsmann subsidiary RTL, said: \"We don't comment on what is speculation. If, at all, there are talks, then they are on a low level.\" Reuters reported him as saying of Worldwide yesterday: \"In theory there are bits that are interesting. But how do you split it off, since it is so integrated into the BBC?\" </p> <p>It is one of many questions unlikely to be answered before the end of year, when the review panel is expected to make its recommendations.</p>",
  "Conservative proposals to overhaul higher education funding will penalise poorer graduates and could put some cash-strapped universities out of business, it was claimed yesterday. <p>The Tories insist that their plans, revealed yesterday, to abolish tuition fees and introduce commercial interest rates of up to 8% on student loans would almost halve graduates' debts on leaving college. </p> <p>But they were condemned by student and lecturers' unions as highly regressive, benefiting high earners and exposing graduates in low-paid jobs to years of mounting debts. One academic accused the party of \"currying favour with the middle classes\". </p> <p>Vice-chancellors welcomed the Tories' recognition of their calls for increased funding, but some raised concerns over the fate of some new, financially less stable universities if a voucher scheme, in which cash is linked entirely to student numbers, was implemented. </p> <p>New universities attacked plans to abolish the current target of 50% of school leavers entering university as a barrier to efforts to widen participation in higher education. </p> <p>The proposals, entitled Funding the Future, are important because they represent settled Tory policy in a key general election battleground. </p> <p>Despite some internal resistance, including initial caution from Michael Howard after his election as Tory leader last year, the party has opted to retain its voter-friendly pledge to abolish all university tuition fees, due to increase under Labour's top-up fee plans to up to \u00a33,000 a year from 2006. </p> <p>The Tories propose charging students a commercial rate of interest, to be capped at 8% for the next parliament but expected to be around 6.5%. But the education secretary, Charles Clarke, denounced the figures as \u00a31.1bn short of viability </p> <p>Students would not have to pay until they earned \u00a315,000 a year, but interest would accrue from graduation. </p> <p>Under the government's loan scheme, student debt is heavily subsidised by the tax payer, rising only in line with inflation. </p> <p>The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said the \u00a31.7bn saved by removing the subsidy, and a further \u00a3500m spent annually on helping students with lower incomes, would be redirected to universities in place of fee income. </p> <p>In a proposal welcomed by vice-chancellors, the Tories would also provide more than \u00a33bn over five years to improve decaying infrastructure. </p> <p>Mr Collins told BBC Radio 4 that no graduate would leave university with higher debts than at present. \"The amount of [individual] debt is reduced quite sharply - the average graduate under the government's plans would leave with loan debt of the order of \u00a319,000. Under our plans they leave with about \u00a310,000 worth of debt.\" </p> <p>The government and the National Union of Students said introducing real interest rates would hit those taking career breaks and those in lower-paying public sector jobs. </p> <p>In a letter to his Tory shadow, Mr Clarke said: \"This policy would have the effect of discriminating between students who sat next to each other on the same course but who took up different jobs.\" A teacher would end up repaying approaching \u00a320,000 on a \u00a310,000 loan, whereas a high earner in the City would repay around \u00a314,000, he said. </p> <p>The NUS president, Kat Fletcher, said Tory promises of fairer funding for higher education were \"merely rhetoric\" which would not win students' votes. The Association of University Teachers said that, if the Tories provided no money to expand student numbers, individual universities would be left to fight for existing students to attract more cash. </p> <p>\"Without some degree of control, this free-for-all could prove a disaster,\" said its general secretary, Sally Hunt. </p> <p>Ivor Crewe, president of the vice chancellors' body, Universities UK, said: \"It's vital that the package benefits the whole sector - Universities UK will be paying particular attention to any potential differential impact these proposals might have on institutions.\"</p>",
  "<p>Psychiatrists last night condemned the government's latest attempt to reform mental health law in England and Wales as \"objectionable, unworkable and likely to bring NHS services to their knees\". </p> <p>They were responding to a draft bill from Rosie Winterton, health minister, setting out the biggest overhaul of mental health legislation since the 1950s. </p> <p>Ms Winterton had been trying for months to broker a compromise between the Home Office's desire to lock up all potentially violent psychopaths and the medical profession's view that mentally ill patients deserved the best possible care. </p> <p>A previous draft bill in 2002 was rejected by the profession because it could have obliged psychiatrists to order the detention of people with severe personality disorder, even if they had committed no crime and had no prospect of a cure. </p> <p>Under the new proposals, it would be left to clinical staff to decide whether it was \"clinically appropriate\" to order compulsory treatment. This might mean sectioning psychopaths who could not be cured of their personality disorder, but might benefit from treatment of depression or anxiety. </p> <p>But Louis Appleby, the government's mental health tsar, conceded that there might be dangerous psychopaths who would not benefit from care. If they posed a threat to society, they would have to be handled by the criminal justice system, not the NHS. </p> <p>The bill is due to go before a scrutiny committee of MPs who will have to decide whether it is an effective compromise or falls between two stools. </p> <p>The 284-page draft bill, with 141 additional pages of explanatory notes, includes a wide range of measures to improve care for the vast majority of mentally ill people who are no threat to anyone. </p> <p>Ms Winterton said: \"Patients in the community who are ill and vulnerable or at risk will now be able to get the treatment they need.\" The bill would tackle the \"revolving door syndrome\" suffered by patients who are discharged from psychiatric hospital and allowed to deteriorate until their condition becomes serious enough for readmission. </p> <p>Extra safeguards for patients will include the right to refuse electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) if they retain mental capacity, and increased maximum sentences for people convicted of ill-treating patients. An independent tribunal will review every detention beyond 28 days and there will be an independent advocacy service to help patients assert their rights. </p> <p>Ms Winterton said 130 extra psychiatrists and about 770 other staff would be needed to implement the bill, mostly because of the new safeguards. </p> <p>Paul Goggins, Home Office minister, said: \"If we are to protect the public, we must ensure those with a mental disorder who are a risk to others receive the high quality mental health treatment they need.\" </p> <p>The Mental Health Alliance, a coalition of 60 mental health groups including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Royal College of Nursing, user groups and charities, said: \"The revised bill could bring mental health services to their knees. It remains objectionable in principle and unworkable in practice.\" </p> <p>Mike Shooter, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: \"We are worried the bill will extend use of compulsory powers to a wider group of patients than is medically necessary, thus putting pressure on psychiatric services, and infringing people's human rights.\" </p> <p>Tony Zigmond, vice president, said the legislation should be about reducing the stigma of mental illness.</p> <p><strong>Range of new powers</strong></p> <p>The draft bill would: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Allow non-offending psychopaths to be detained indefinitely \"if clinically appropriate\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Introduce compulsory treatment in the community to protect patients in danger of relapse </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Allow people to refuse electroconvulsive therapy if they retain mental capacity </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Increase maximum sentences for those convicted of ill-treating patients </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Establish a new independent tribunal to review every detention lasting longer than 28 days </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Provide an independent advocacy service to help patients assert their rights</p>",
  "<p>The European Union will have to retain the option of building new nuclear power plants for at least the next 50 years, energy commissioner Loyola de Palacio said yesterday. </p> <p>Insisting there was no alternative, she said: \"The production of nuclear energy has been increasing. This is the reality and, with the challenge of climate change, the EU cannot avoid nuclear energy for the foreseeable future.\" </p> <p>Her comments came after the commission watered down draft legislation for binding common rules to enforce nuclear safety and compel members to set deadlines for programmes to store waste and decommission plants. </p> <p>But Britain made plain it would join forces with Germany, Finland and Sweden in blocking the revised proposals at the council of ministers. The \"gang of four\" have so far killed off the plans, with the UK insisting there is no urgent need for EU intervention. </p> <p>Ms de Palacio said the proposed legislation would bring greater transparency to an industry hidden from public scrutiny. But she admitted the plans no longer contained strict deadlines for storage schemes for high-level radioactive waste, and that the EC had not finished its inquiry into the funding of decommissioning and waste management - critical in Britain, which is seeking approval for its \u00a35bn rescue plan for British Energy.</p>",
  "Tony Blair's latest ministerial reshuffle turned into an extraordinary test of wills last night after Alan Milburn agreed to return to cabinet with overall control of policy and general election strategy - but only after boldly holding out for copper-bottomed guarantees about the scope of his new role. <p>He emerged in mid-evening from a 40-minute chat with the prime minister clutching control of the No 10 policy directorate and strategy unit and three important party posts that place him at the heart of election planning, as well as the honorific cabinet title, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and a \u00a3127,000 a year salary. </p> <p>In what Blairites presented as a battle for the soul of an unprecedented third term Labour government, Mr Milburn's decision to play tough with Mr Blair, his friend and political patron, overshadowed the reshuffle's one clear decision. </p> <p>Alan Johnson, a postman turned higher education minister, replaced Andrew Smith as work and pensions secretary. But the arrival of the first former general secretary of a trade union around the cabinet table since the legendary Frank Cousins - 40 years ago - was relegated to a sideshow as Mr Milburn's friends urged him to dig his heels in and \"get the fight with the Brownites over\" before it could start. </p> <p>The scale of Mr Milburn's demands were said to have bemused even the prime minister who believed he was offering him a central role well beyond acting as the leading party spokesman or election coordinator. </p> <p>One source said: \"He is being offered an absolutely central role - things that will send Gordon off the Richter scale.\" </p> <p>But after days of bruising briefing and counter-briefing Treasury sources said last night: \"People here will be relaxed about this. It doesn't present any difficulties for anyone here.\" </p> <p>Mr Milburn's role will be to coordinate policy development across government, a coded term for promoting the Blairite version of modernisation. </p> <p>In his party hat he will become general election coordinator, a role now held by the chancellor's ally, Douglas Alexander; a government member of Labour's NEC developing election planning; and a member of the election strategy group chaired by Mr Blair. </p> <p>\"He will definitely be involved in drawing up the manifesto,\" one party official said. </p> <p>A cabinet supporter of Mr Milburn commented: \"This is excellent, it will greatly strengthen policy across government and give us a more radical manifesto with progressive policies that reflect Labour values.\" </p> <p>Last night's rolling reshuffle also confirmed that Ian McCartney, whose dignified plea to keep his post as party chairman in yesterday's Guardian triggered a flood of supportive emails, was safe in his job. </p> <p>But a significant development after days of Brown-Blair speculation saw some MPs reveal that John Prescott, the crucial peacemaker between No 10 and No 11 Downing Street, had privately expressed anger that the chancellor's allies had overplayed their hand. \"Prescott's furious because he saved McCartney, not Brown who didn't lift a finger,\" said one pro-Blair leftwinger. </p> <p>Mr Prescott was also cross that Mr Smith's departure was presented by Treasury sources as a row with No 10 over invalidity benefit policy. </p> <p>\"John read the riot act,\" said another MP. </p> <p>The promotion of the Blairite Mr Johnson and the prospect that Mr Milburn will get a major election role is likely to be seen as impinging on the chancellor's role and that of his election strategy ally, Mr Alexander, who was Chancellor of the Duchy until last night. </p> <p>But if Mr Milburn is identified with a poor campaign in which Labour loses much of its huge majority - outright defeat is barely conceivable - Mr Brown can expect to rapidly move next door. </p> <p>Mr Milburn spent a dramatic day at Westminster locked in discussions with his close political allies John Reid, health secretary, Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary, and Stephen Byers, the former cabinet minister and old friend. </p> <p>At a lunchtime meeting the group discussed the terms Mr Milburn should set for returning from 14 months away from the front bench, spending more time with his young family. </p> <p>Mr Milburn, who grew up on a council estate, has a distinctive set of views about the devolution of power down from Whitehall, the future of the welfare state and wider choice in the public services. </p> <p>Mr Brown is also a moderniser, but with different priorities and remedies. </p> <p>He resents charges that he is over-concerned with attacking the Tories and lacks vision beyond technocratic Treasury remedies. After past clashes he sees Mr Milburn as a disruptive influence and potential rival. Mr Milburn had accepted on Tuesday that Mr McCartney would remain party chairman, the job he was earmarked for in July. But he was determined that he was not going to return simply to act as the media front man for the election. </p> <p>A modest number of further ministerial changes will come today.</p>",
  "Alan Milburn, the new Labour policy and election coordinator, has risen to the symbolic status of leading moderniser inside the party, and the man uniquely willing to play hardball with the chancellor. <p>Yet 14 months ago it looked as if he was to play the role of Labour's lost leader, stunning Tony Blair by telling him that he was quitting. </p> <p>If he seizes the chance he has been offered, he now has the opportunity to shape the third term and the basis on which any successor to Mr Blair will inherit the party. </p> <p>Some claim he is an intellectual lightweight in comparison with Gordon Brown's rigour, command and range. His true attraction, they claim, is a developed hairstyle and smooth sub-Blairite charm. </p> <p>But in a class-based party, he is a street fighter, the son of a single mother, raised in the mining village of Tow Law, in Co Durham. He used that skill over the past week. </p> <p>Once it was leaked in the weekend press that he was about to be brought back, probably as party chairman, his camp insisted there was no done deal. But they also made it plain there was a big job to be done. They feared that the local and European elections and two parliamentary byelections had revealed the limits of running a traditional campaign in which dividing lines are set out showing Labour committed to public spending and the Tories the party of cuts. </p> <p>Mr Milburn stayed in the north-east conferring with No 10 by phone and with Stephen Byers, his close friend. There did not seem a willingness to compromise with the Brown team. </p> <p>Quickly the unions, Mr Brown's allies and John Prescott moved to defend the threatened party chairman, Ian McCartney, from demotion. </p> <p>But events at Westminster in the form of Andrew Smith's unexpected resignation as work and pensions secretary on Monday strengthened Mr Milburn's hand and hardened the mettle inside No 10. </p> <p>By Tuesday, it became clear that Mr McCartney would retain his party chairmanship. His interview in the Guardian, defending his record, underlined his confidence. </p> <p>The challenge to Mr Blair's authority was so clear that the Milburnites sensed that they could set ambitious terms. One friend said: \"Alan felt there was no point returning to something nebulous that would just store up trouble for later.\" </p> <p>He sought a seat on the national executive, a place in the cabinet and a clear understanding that he would be in charge of policymaking, including the manifesto. It was audacious. </p> <p>Mr McCartney, Mr Brown and the current election coordinator, Douglas Alexander, had grounds to be aggrieved. </p> <p>Returning to Westminster yesterday, Mr Milburn met the culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, and the health secretary, John Reid. </p> <p>They agreed the proposed terms of his appointment, and with the prime minister slightly bewildered by Mr Milburn's demands, the much delayed face to face meeting occurred soon after six. The deal was secured. </p> <p>Mr Milburn knows one of his first tasks is to try to come to some kind of accommodation with the chancellor. </p> <p>Any reading of his many speeches since he joined the backbenches will reveal him as a complex thinker. The themes of active citizenship, voluntarism, power to the people and neighbourhood empowerment will be important. He will buzz, but in the process he will need to keep an increasingly divided party together. It is an extraordinary challenge that will require every ounce of his political toughness.</p>",
  "The Archbishop of Canterbury called last night for campaigners on issues such as social justice, health and the environment to be given formal access to international bodies, including the UN's security council. <p>But, speaking at the first of a series of \"public dialogues\" about world issues, Rowan Williams expressed doubts that such non-governmental organisations would gain the ear of such bodies in the foreseeable future. </p> <p>During the event at St Paul's Cathedral, Dr Williams also discussed the difficulties the US faced in persuading people across the globe that it was not a threatening \"empire\". </p> <p>However, he spoke with more optimism about the potential for religions to work together to put pressure on politicians. </p> <p>Dr Williams shared a platform at the dialogue, which posed the question: \"How should the world be governed?\", with the former foreign secretary Lord Owen and Philip Bobbitt, professor of constitutional law at the University of Texas. </p> <p>Lord Owen suggested structures such as the UN's security council and the World Health Organisation were working quite well and could improve. He said the chances of the world being better governed in 30 years were \"pretty strong\". </p> <p>Dr Williams said the security council needed to be reformed to give non-governmental groups \"a right of audience\". He said: \"We want to look at who has the right of access and with whom the security council must consult.\" </p> <p>The archbishop said the most valuable \"transnational\" institutions in the future would be those which allowed a \"responsible critical exchange\", but he claimed: \"We are still some way from finding those.\" </p> <p>Dr Williams added: \"The worst futures we could face would be those which are dominated by unchallengeable voices.\" </p> <p>Dr Williams revealed he was attending a Christian-Muslim dialogue in Egypt this weekend. </p> <p>The next of the dialogues, which are being organised by the St Paul's Institute, takes place next Wednesday; its title: Is there an alternative to global capitalism?</p>",
  "Alan Milburn has argued that the state's role should evolve from exclusive provider to purchaser. Schools and hospitals, alongside councils and surgeries should be able to enjoy more autonomy within the public sector. <p>Where it is feasible, users should exercise individual choice over things such as elderly care or hospital operations. </p> <p>The Treasury supports choice in the provision of public services, and the use of private finance and contractors to provide services. Mr Brown has been a long-term advocate of extending the role of the voluntary sector in providing services. He believes that perfect markets cannot operate in the public services </p> <p>Encouraging new forms of local action has become a hallmark of radical new Labour thinking by Mr Milburn and others. People should be allowed to create directly elected neighbourhood councils to tackle local crime and grime issues, such as anti-social behaviour and street cleaning. They would control some of the budget. </p> <p>Direct elections to the boards of local services such as school governing bodies could take place. </p> <p>The Treasury has stalled plans to give local government powers to raise a larger proportion of its own revenue, drawing questions on how far the chancellor's localism agenda goes. But he has put emphasis on the importance of regional economic devolution </p> <p>Mr Milburn believes that in time all parents should be entitled to request flexible working hours, and that there is a strong case for allowing families to choose which parent should be able to claim parental leave. </p> <p>Mr Brown has emphasised Sure Start and Children's Centres as a way of targeting help for poor families </p> <p>Mr Milburn's championing of foundation hospitals derived from his belief in the need for radical reform in the NHS. Were he to take charge of the manifesto there would certainly be more of that. </p> <p>He has suggested an ultimatum needs to be placed before the food industry. Unless it voluntarily cuts fat, sugar and salt in food within a specified time frame then tough regulatory action will be taken to ensure that it does. </p> <p>The big split between the chancellor and Mr Milburn when he was health secretary was over foundation hospitals. The chancellor wanted to limit their independence and did so. That battle is over now that the programme is a reality. Attention has turned to what will be in the manifesto. Mr Brown commissioned a lengthy study on the future of the NHS from Derek Wanless setting out the importance of shifting to a preventive public health agenda. </p> <p>\"In my view\", Mr Milburn argued in a recent speech, \"the trades unions are lagging behind and need to catch up. Otherwise they will render themselves irrelevant, and I think that would be retrograde, as the country needs strong trades unions.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown is careful not to criticise the unions directly, but he has pushed a flexible labour market agenda in Europe, including the need for greater competition. </p> <p>Mr Milburn seems explicitly concerned by inequality and declining social mobility. He has pointed out that over the past two decades high male earnings have risen at twice the rate of those at the bottom. He has argued for the replacement of old solutions for combating poverty - like higher social security benefits - with ones that tackle its root causes and which offer new rights to work and to train in exchange for responsibility. He sees owning property as a way of helping the poor and thinks the government should put its efforts into increasing home ownership, and not just improving social housing. </p> <p>Mr Brown says he favours not equality of opportunity, but fairness in outcome. He has proposed that the Treasury should provide each child born after September 2002 with \u00a3250 as a contribution to their own individual child trust fund, rising to \u00a3500.</p>",
  "When the 50 riders of the Bicester hunt take to the fields and woodland of Oxfordshire today for their third outing of the week, they will share a steely resolve to carry on bagging foxes whatever the circumstances, according to Patrick Martin. <p>With farmers plagued by an animal they call vermin - the hunt has killed 10 foxes so far this week - Martin, a full-time huntsman for 25 years in charge of 120 hounds, said the mood was \"punchy\". </p> <p>\"I don't mean that in a violent way,\" he insisted. \"But people have kept their cool and nerve for seven or so years, made the case for continuing hunting by strict regulation, and now all the evidence has been ignored and it comes down to the personal prejudice of backbench MPs. No one is going to go along with violence but certain frustrated individuals may boil over.\" </p> <p>While most hunt followers and riders across the country insist that direct action will only be considered as a last resort, it was clear that matters could get quickly out of hand. </p> <p>Militant groups, close to a fuel lobby which brought Britain to a standstill four years ago with blockades of refineries and tanker de pots, could well be at the forefront of civil disobedience, according to some countryside campaigners. </p> <p>\"They are waiting for an issue like this which will be seen as an attack on a way of life,\" one farmer from the west country, involved in earlier mass-picketing, said. \"Passions are running high, there is plenty to exploit, and all kinds of grievances can be hung on to this issue, particularly a feeling that the government doesn't care about the countryside.\" </p> <p>Next Thursday, when the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, is due to announce legislation, the Countryside Alliance, which brought hundreds of thousands to London for peaceful rallies, is planning a mass protest outside Westminster. </p> <p>Although organisers stress this demonstration will be within the law, the presence of tens of thousands of pro-hunt supporters in the capital is likely to cause chaos, regardless of any more militant action. </p> <p>Simon Hart, chief executive of the alliance, claimed the government had chosen the path of \"prejudice and spite\". </p> <p>He added: \"The reaction this unleashes will be entirely its own responsibility. The wider public will ask how a prime minister who last week pledged that his policies will benefit hard - working families can justify this vicious, prejudiced attack on families across the country.\" </p> <p>Aside from claims that any ban is an attack on civil liberties - and the alliance is planning to challenge the government in the courts - the campaigners' main complaint is the threat to jobs. The Burns report on hunting said up to 8,000 could be at risk, half the number initially claimed by the alliance. </p> <p>But anti-hunt campaigners claim there are fewer than 1,000 full-time equivalent jobs provided by hunts.</p>",
  "Tony Blair last night sanctioned a major gamble on Labour's promised ban on hunting when the government announced that the long-blocked legislation will be pushed through the Lords and Commons this winter - but implementation will be delayed until safely after the general election. <p>It means that Mr Blair and his election strategists have decided that Tory peers will find it harder to block the bill if they get two years respite to wind down their hunts, and that the chances of packs of dogs being shot - and dumped on politicians' doorsteps - during the election campaign will be reduced. </p> <p>The first response from some pro-ban Labour MPs was one of pragmatic satisfaction that, despite the tactical delay, the issue is finally being resolved. \"That will do,\" said Dennis Skinner. Tony Banks was less pleased. \"A one year delay would be reasonable, two years looks like it's slippery,\" he said. </p> <p>The Conservative leader Michael Howard raised the stakes by promising parliamentary time to MPs who might want to repeal the ban if, against the odds, he emerges as prime minister. </p> <p>That hurled gauntlet will suit Labour strategists who believe that it is one more reason to persuade wavering supporters to bury their doubts - or their dislike of the invader of Iraq - and vote for the ban. </p> <p>With MPs preoccupied with the ministerial reshuffle, Alun Michael, the rural affairs minister, finally issued a written statement setting out the new strategy. The only surprise was the two-year delay to defuse the divisive and emotive issue during the election. </p> <p>It may not work. Government business managers and Tory peers are locked in negotiations over how much time is required to debate the reintroduced hunting bill which MPs are expected to put through the Commons on a free vote in a single day - so as the much more pro-hunting peers get enough time to have their say without jeopardising other bills. </p> <p>\"The government has made it clear that the issue does not have as high a priority as issues like jobs and schools and hospitals and transport, to name a few,\" said Mr Michael. </p> <p>There will be no compensation and ministers have rejected claims that it is a human rights issue. </p> <p>A ban on hare coursing, disliked by some Tory as well as Labour MPs, will be introduced in three months. If necessary the Parliament Act will be invoked to override a Lords veto so that the bill is likely to be on the statute book in the spring. Mr Michael urged the Lords to engage in a proper debate and cooperate. </p> <p>The two year grace will give more than adequate time for the humane arrangements for the dispersal or rehoming of dogs, or the refocussing of business activities towards drag huntig. </p> <p>Extra time \"will also give hunters time to respect the will of parliament and threats of violence, illegal activity are not justified,\" said Mr Michael. \"If people want to continue their opposition to legislation, the ballot box is the place to express your views. We are being reasonable and giving a chance for hunts to sort themselves out.\" </p> <p>Lord Strathclyde, the wily Tory leader of the Lords, is holding out for six days of debate, whereas the government believes two are sufficient. </p> <p>The timing issue is crucial because the legislative timetable could have a knock-on effect on the electoral timetable - something Lord Strathclyde knows well.</p>",
  "Scotland's ban on fox hunting came into force more than two years ago - but on Saturday mornings it is still possible to see hunters riding to hounds in fields and lanes across the country. <p>The ban is an unhappy compromise in which neither animal rights activists nor fox hunting enthusiasts side got entirely what they wanted. \"It was a happy day for us, but there are lots of problems with the act,\" said a spokeswoman for Advocates for Animals. </p> <p>The law banning fox hunting - the first private member's bill to be passed by the Scottish parliament - is a cumbersome piece of legislation. </p> <p>Foxes can still be hunted in Scotland, but how they are killed is crucial. Nine of Scotland's 10 mounted hunts have survived because the legislation stipulates that dogs can be used to flush foxes to guns. </p> <p>So, in Dumfriesshire or Perthshire, the hunts still meet and dogs are still used to flush out foxes. But, crucially, the dogs must not be allowed to kill the fox; it must be shot. It is an extremely difficult law to police. </p> <p>Despite disputes over how the ban is framed, it has undoubtedly drastically changed hunting north of the border. Most hunts say their numbers have fallen. Though only one has folded, most confess they are having difficulty surviving. </p> <p>According to the Scottish Countryside Alliance, the number of people taking part in flushing foxes to hounds has fallen by between 50% and 75%. </p> <p>Scottish huntsmen say the economic impact may be small, but it has adversely affected their culture - from hunt balls to meeting their friends. Individual hunt-related businesses, such as stables and horse breeders, say their earnings are down by between 25% and 50%.</p>",
  "The Hartlepool byelection will take place on September 30, last day of the Labour conference, it was confirmed yesterday when Peter Mandelson formally stepped down as an MP to take up his new position as European commissioner. <p>Hartlepool has seen vigorous campaigning by opposition parties over the summer, with the Liberal Democrats particularly hopeful of making a significant dent in Mr Mandelson's 14,571 majority. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson ended his 12-year career at Westminster by the arcane process of applying to the chancellor, Gordon Brown, for appointment to the office of steward and bailiff of the Manor of Northstead. </p> <p>He takes up his position as trade commissioner in Brussels on November 1. David Blunkett, home secretary, who was in the town to support the campaign of Labour candidate Ian Wright, made the announcement while speaking to reporters. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat candidate Jody Dunn's agent, Richard Pinnock, said: \"At last after months of speculation we can start the campaign.\" </p> <p>The Conservative candidate Jeremy Middleton said: \"Hartlepool has been let down by Labour. The biggest failure has been on law and order, with violent crime rising and drug addiction at twice the national average. This is a scandal from a government that promised to be tough on crime and on the causes of crime.</p>",
  "Power struggles at the top of the Labour party have come to a head this week as Tony Blair has struggled to shape his much delayed cabinet reshuffle. But do the conflicts centre on rival personal ambition or reflect big ideological differences? <p>At the heart of this week's action has been the prime minister's ambition to appoint Alan Milburn to some kind of general election campaign role, with responsibility for the manifesto. </p> <p>Ministers met yesterday in an attempt to settle the row, and find out what role Mr Milburn was prepared to accept. But why has his appointment proved such a sticking point? </p> <p>It is often asserted that Gordon Brown and Mr Milburn are at ideological daggers drawn and that this reshuffle has in effect been a battle for the shape of Labour's third term. If he gains control over Labour's election strategy, Mr Milburn will have the right to intrude in territory the chancellor has traditionally considered his own. </p> <p>Certainly, the two have clashed in the past, mainly over foundation hospitals' ability to borrow free from Treasury controls. </p> <p>It is assumed that the two would clash right across the public sector with Mr Milburn bound to emphasise choice and the private sector more than Mr Brown. </p> <p>But looking at the details of the two men's speeches over the past year, it is clear both are modernisers willing to break old shibboleths. Mr Brown believes perfect markets cannot operate in the public services. </p> <p>Mr Milburn has argued that the state's role should evolve from exclusive provider to purchaser. </p> <p>Mr Brown has certainly been willing to give local government greater powers, even if the number of earmarked funding streams has increased. Mr Milburn, for his part, has made empowering local communities a major theme of his speeches from the backbenches. But significant as they are, these differences are not fundamental. </p> <p>That is why the drama over who is in the government and who is out has been seen, fairly or not, as at heart a symptom of the unsettled relationship between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.</p>",
  "Talk about a cliff-hanger: the wooing of Alan Milburn, and his on-off-on-off decision about whether to return to Tony Blair's cabinet to confront the ambitions of Gordon Brown, has been an extraordinary soap-operatic farce, even by the wild standards of the New Labour years. He didn't ask to come back. Blair's people more or less announced that he would be coming, anyway. He thought he'd got firm promises from Blair about his powers to oversee the third-term programme. At one stage those promises melted away. Milburn insisted on reassuarance befor accepting the job. <p>By last night, almost everyone involved was angry and confused. Blairites were in despair about the prime minister's apparent unwillingness to confront Brown. Brownites were appalled by the leaking of the plan to use Milburn to humiliate the chancellor. And decent Labour people outside both camps were wringing their hands at the dreadful damage the government was managing to inflict on itself, just days into the new political season. </p> <p>The stakes this week have been very high. Either the prime minister got his way and reshaped the cabinet, making it clear that he was in charge, taking Labour in a more market-radical (or rightwing) direction, and for a long time. Or else he caved in, the Blairites started to crumble, and the direction changed. </p> <p>At first sight, it all seems ludicrously finickity - Milburn and his family aside, who cares about the exact terms of reference for his new cabinet job? But this is no more the real cause of conflict than the assassin's bullet winging towards the Archduke in Sarajevo. Though the crisis may seem to have come out of a clear blue, late-summer sky, it has been building for a long time. Blair's people accuse the Brownites, who are fed up waiting for Blair's departure, of trying to stage a putsch after the local elections, and failing. Historians can pick over all that, though I saw no credible signs of any plot. What matters more is that each side was terminally mistrustful of the other before everyone returned to Westminster this month. </p> <p>Far from a Brownite putsch, the real story of the summer is of a second New Labour putsch. First came the bid to put Peter Mandelson in place of Andrew Smith, as secretary of state for work and pensions - hence the unpleasant undermining of Smith, which continued over the summer and culminated in his resignation earlier this week. Mandelson was to have pushed ahead with radical reform of the welfare system - but his return was blocked after at least five cabinet members put their foot down. Europe was his consolation prize. </p> <p>Beaten on that one, Blair determined to bring back Alan Milburn as election mastermind - all part of a strategy, being urged by some Blairites, of going in for the kill. Rub Gordon's nose in it by putting in Milburn, an utterly self-confident Blairite whose loathing of the chancellor is the worst kept secret in British politics. Then, for an encore, drive through a thoroughly Blairite, modernising manifesto and make it clear you're staying on until Brown is grey, or even white. And when he does move on, well, there's Blair Mark Two, in the form of Alan Milburn, groomed for the succession. </p> <p>Where, you might wonder, is the danger for Tony Blair in any of that? He seems stronger than ever. The early summer elections were very bad but not completely disastrous. There is no Tory revival. Blair may no longer be liked by large numbers of ordinary Labour activists; but the man's on a roll. </p> <p>Yet the danger is clear enough. For a start, leaders can't anoint their own successors. Thatcher tried and failed - remember John Moore, John Patten, and the other leaders in waiting who disappeared without trace? The fact is that the next Labour leader will be chosen by the Labour party, not Tony Blair. And at present, Alan Milburn, with his enthusiasm for the market, is not top of the pops among Labour's rank and file. </p> <p>But this is much more than a gamble about the succession. This public declaration of war - and make no mistake, to put Alan Milburn in charge of the manifesto is seen by the Brownites as a declaration of war - risks destabilising the entire party in the run up to the election campaign. The idea that Brown would go along with it quietly is, according to someone close to him, \"ridiculous\". It's not just Brown. John Prescott, who despairs of the Brown-Blair circus, and Ian McCartney have been in there battling to retain their influence too. In the weeks to come, other ministers, MPs, party members and trade unionists will join the fray. </p> <p>For although Labour manifestos are put together by a host of different sources - from No 10 thinktanks to the national policy forum, the key question is who wields the pen. He or she will set the tone and direction of the next Labour administration. </p> <p>Milburn, according to those who have been trying to persuade him back, (John Reid, Tessa Jowell and Stephen Byers), is just the man to come up with a radical manifesto which addresses the opportunity society which New Labour wants. But his opponents claim that \"radical\" is simply a code word for privatisation, and suggest that Milburn's instincts have little in common with Labour values. </p> <p>The only certainty, now that Milburn has accepted the job, is that stories of personality splits and policy differences are not going to go away. Up until now, New Labour has worked simply because it has been a sprawling and in many ways unlikely coalition. To try to turn it into a narrower clique, with only true disciples of the Dear Leader in the ascendancy will bust that coalition apart. </p> <p>How can it help Labour, at this point in the electoral cycle, for the party to narrow itself and the leadership to alienate all those decent, mainstream, Labour people who feel queasy about our linking up with hardline US Republicans, or who don't want to see private healthcare companies marching into the core of the NHS? </p> <p>Blair hasn't thrived as a political leader in spite of the compromises he's made with Labour's natural supporters. He's survived because of those compromises. John Prescott isn't simply a grumpy old household god who has to be appeased and patronised for PR reasons. He's a Real Labour man who's fought his way up from the bottom. Gordon Brown isn't an angry egomaniac. He's the brightest moderniser around, who can take credit for many of the greatest successes this government has had. </p> <p>Now, it seems, we have the worst of all worlds. Blair, in trying to assert his authority, has only proved how dubious it is. Brown may not have dictated who he puts in his cabinet, but the agonisingly drawn-out process shows that Blair is not fully in control, either. And the debate about Labour's direction for the third term, which ought to be in its final stages, has hardly begun. This is not just another cabinet squabble. This is turning into a political car crash. The majority is bigger, but the spectacle reminds me now of John Major's Tories in their very worst moments. This level of factionalism is big enough to destroy a government. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Sight for sore eyes</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Second Sight</strong><br> PlayStation 2 (also available for Xbox and GameCube), \u00a339.99 Free Radical/Codemasters, <br>4 stars</p> <p>From the guys who brought you the excellent Timesplitters 2, Second Sight begins with the tiresome premise of a guy waking up with amnesia in a military hospital, but quickly proves to be more than the sum of its cliches. After the early level, where your na\u00efve pre-self is taken through the military training that so obviously fails him, you notice real depth to these traditionally-2D characters. </p> <p>Using flashbacks to tell a story is not new, but making them playable is. The action is unusual, too, allowing you to switch between first and third person viewpoints, and making weapons only half your armoury. The other half is provided by an array of psychic powers. </p> <p>The first time you experiment with hurling a computer monitor across a room to disarm a guard, you will laugh out loud at the possibilities. </p> <p>Not all of those are realised, however. The game only lets you do what it wants you to, when the combination of weapons and telekinesis could achieve so much more in a truly freeform game. And although your powers can be upgraded, the balance between mental and physical weapons never quite feels natural. </p> <p>However, the graphics are top notch and the challenges always varied. There's no doubt Second Sight has taken the Sam Fisher/Solid Snake genre into interesting new territory, which makes Free Radical an outfit to watch. <br><strong> Mike Anderiesz</strong> </p> <p><strong> Sony fails the fans</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Formula One 04</strong> <br>PlayStation 2, \u00a339.99 Sony, <br>2 stars</p> <p> For years, Sony has shared the official Formula One game licence with Electronic Arts. Now that it has sole rights, however, it has added responsibility to fans of the sport - and this game, despite technical impressiveness verging on brilliance, utterly fails to satisfy that. </p> <p>It has a long list of pros: fantastic graphics, great car handling, all this year's tracks (which means you can race around Shanghai before the real drivers) and the two flying lap qualifying process. But the game's structure undoes all that good work. Formula One 04's focal point is the career game mode, in which you get the chance to impress representatives from Minardi, Jordan and Toyota at test sessions and thereby work your way up the ladder. </p> <p>The trouble is that you have to produce fast laps instantly on circuits you have not seen before. Test ses sions are aborted if all four wheels leave the tarmac and target times lie somewhere between harsh and unobtainable. When you do start your F1 career, it is impossible to do anything other than tool around at the back of the field without tinkering with your car's setup - which is boring and hopelessly hit-or-miss without a virtual mechanic to assist you. </p> <p>You can dip into five-lap Grands Prix at the circuit of your choice in arcade mode, but if you want the full GP weekend experience, expect frustration unless you actually are Jenson Button. We doubt the experience Sony wanted to offer was an accurate depiction of how the hopeless Zsolt Baumgartner must feel every fortnight - but that is what you get. <br> <strong> Steve Boxer</strong> </p> <p><strong> Doubling up</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Shellshock Nam '67</strong> <br>Xbox, PlayStation 2, \u00a339.99 Guerilla/Eidos, <br>2 stars</p> <p> Unfortunately for Eidos, it isn't the only publisher to think the theatre of the Vietnam war could translate into a videogame setting. Also out this month is Conflict: Vietnam a third-person team-based shooter. </p> <p>Shellshock is similar in approach, but the emphasis is on depicting the gritty horror of the conflict. So the initial movie sequence features images of dead GIs, while segments of the game show graphic torture sequences and burnt villages. </p> <p>The tour of duty is varied - some missions involve helping the locals, while others have stealth elements. All involve shooting the Viet Cong. And while the game tries to engender a feeling of compassion for your soldier, the constant slaughter makes it hard to have much sympathy. </p> <p>What Shellshock does do well is recreate the claustrophobia of the jungle. There are some extremely tense moments as your troops inch forward. Sadly, the direction your boys go is predetermined. Linearity is bearable if the mechanics work, but there are too many other niggles, such as respawning enemies and dicky support from team mates. <br> <strong> Greg Howson</strong> </p> <p><strong> Top 5 Games</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> 1.</strong> Conflict: Vietnam </p> <p><strong> 2.</strong> Shellshock: Nam '67 </p> <p><strong> 3.</strong> Spider-Man 2 </p> <p><strong> 4.</strong> The Simpsons: Hit and Run </p> <p><strong> 5.</strong> Athens 2004 </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Source: Elspa, compiled by Chart Track</p>",
  "<p><strong> Goodbye floppies</strong><br> To back-up my work, I save my files to floppy disks on a daily basis. However, I notice that new systems, such as Dell, do not provide a floppy disk drive as standard. Will I be in difficulties if my new system should ever fail because I won't be able to transfer files to another, non-floppy disk machine? <br><strong> Mary Pebble</strong> </p> <p><strong> Jack Schofield replies: </strong> Floppies are now more or less obsolete because most people need to back up files that are much too big to fit on a 1.44 megabyte disk. However, \"super- floppies\", such as Iomega's 100MB and 250MB Zip disks have failed to take over. Today, the best option is probably to copy working files to a USB drive - sometimes called a thumb drive, keychain drive or memory stick which plugs into a USB serial port. You can then do a weekly back-up of the same files to a CD-R, which costs about 25-30p. (Don't use so-called \"packet writing\", which treats the CD as a floppy: it is too unreliable for back-ups.) </p> <p>If files are really important, you should also keep an off-site back-up, eg by leaving a couple of CDs with a relative, or by copying the files to a server on the internet. You could use, say, a Yahoo briefcase to store small files (up to 30MB), or mail them to yourself at a free Yahoo, Gmail or Spymac mailbox. </p> <p>However, if you find floppies useful, most PC suppliers will be happy to fit a 3.5in drive. With a Dell Dimension 2400, for example, this adds \u00a323.50 to the price. </p> <p><strong> System checker</strong><br> You recommended checking Windows' task manager to see what is running at any time. My PC has lots of oddly named programs running (winmgmt, wuauclt), and I wonder if there is any easy way I can check whether these are just obscurely named MS products, or whether they are dangerous. I came across <a href=\"http://www.neuber.com/taskmanager/taskmanager.html\">www.neuber.com/taskmanager/taskmanager.html</a>, and wonder whether it might help. <br><strong> Alison Matthews</strong> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> Pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del in Windows brings up Task Manager, which tells you which programs are running. You can find out what these are by consulting the Task List pages at <a href=\"http://www.answersthatwork.com/Tasklist_pages/tasklist.htm\">www.answersthatwork.com/Tasklist_pages/tasklist.htm</a>, or by searching Google. For example, wuauclt is the background process that checks Microsoft's website for updates to Windows Me. In Windows XP, the Task Manager has different tabs for applications (Notepad, Internet Explorer etc) and Processes (Notepad.exe, Explorer.exe, Winword,exe). Most processes are obscure (lsass, csrss etc) but again, you can look them up. Security TaskManager would certainly help, but it costs $29. I'd suggest trying the free (donations welcome) Startup Inspector for Windows ( A HREF=\"http://www.windowsstartup.com\"&gt;www.windowsstartup.com) first. Run it and click Consult. For geeks, there's Process Explorer from Sysinternals (<a href=\"http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/procexp.shtml\">www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/procexp.shtml</a>), which is also free. </p> <p><strong> Late booking</strong><br> I am trying to book a flight on the EasyJet site but it says: \"Javascript does not appear to be enabled on your browser.\" I have the Microsoft VM ticked. How do I fix it? <br><strong> Dorothy Brown</strong> </p> <p><strong> JS: </strong> Netscape launched Javascript as LiveScript and changing the name has created a lot of pointless confusion: it has nothing to do with the browser's Java Virtual Machine (JVM). You have to enable Internet Explorer's well hidden Active Scripting, which handles Javascript, Microsoft's JScript and the combined standard, ECMAScript (ECMA-262). Go to Tools|Internet Options and click the Security tab, then the Custom Level button. Scroll down to Active Scripting, near the bottom, and click the radio button that says Enable. You can check that it is working by visiting the WebImageView site at <a href=\"https://webimageview.mandtbank.com/BrowserConfiguration.html\">https://webimageview.mandtbank.com/BrowserConfiguration.html</a>.</p> <p><strong> Broadband speeds </strong><br> My village gets broadband in October, but the lines will only connect at a maximum of 512kpbs because, apparently, of the length of the cables. If I buy a 1Mbps service, will it operate closer to the 512kbps speed all the time or will I just be wasting my money? <br><strong> Oliver Hulme</strong> </p> <p> <strong> JS: </strong> If the lines will only deliver 512kbps then you will not get more bandwidth by paying for 1Mbps. However, you might get an improvement by paying for a service with a lower contention ratio, such as 20:1 rather than 50:1. Otherwise, in everyday use, 1Mbps isn't much better than 512kbps because of latencies in the rest of the internet: you can request a web page quicker, but it still takes the server time to respond. Any bottlenecks along the way can also slow the delivery. If you are downloading large files, of course, higher speeds can offer dramatic improvements. </p> <p><strong> Backchat</strong><br> William B Lyons asks if anyone has heard of anybody actually receiving a free PC from Metronomy (<a href=\"http://www.metronomy.com\">www.metronomy.com</a>), as discussed here on January 8. </p>"
